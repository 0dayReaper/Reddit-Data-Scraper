    "postText": "In recent years with the rise of pre-production and waning of last minute live-shoot production, the frequency of fiascos that result from the live-shoot production system has drastically dropped. I wanted to take a trip down memory lane of past live-shoot fiascos to put in perspective how pre-production has changed the drama landscape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[From 'The King of Dramas' \\(\ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8\uc758 \uc81c\uc655\\) \\[SBS 2012\\]](https://preview.redd.it/f5cfszgwv2xa1.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=32fa0f5ccb444d232d33d508094d983243f2cca7)\n\n**What is the live-shoot production system?**\n\nHistorically, the Korean production system has been dominated by live-shot productions where episodes are being scripted, shot and edited mere days before their airing. Sometimes in [egregious cases](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_entertainment/590405.html), shooting and editing continue until even a few minutes before the episode is to be aired on the broadcast station.\n\nThis contrasts starkly with pre-production where **all episodes are completely produced** before broadcast, as is common for US and U.K. shows where entire seasons are filmed up to a year [before broadcast](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150818001025).\n\nWhile live-shoot production provided the [advantage](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20160411011500320) of allowing script writers and producers to change the plot and actors to adjust their performance based on real-time feedback from viewers, it also meant abysmal shooting conditions that resulted in a variety of mishaps and sometimes tragedy.\n\nWith [changes](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=3021019) to the drama industry, including the rise of OTTs and global streaming, production has moved more and more towards pre-production. And even for those still being live-shot, they have often started filming earlier, resulting in better conditions and fewer mishaps.\n\nPersonally, I look forward to the day when production mishaps and tragedy that are a direct result of the hectic live-shoot production schedule is a distant memory. Before that happens, take a trip down memory lane with me of some memorable live-shoot fiascos.\n\n# When the star disappears!\n\n**2010 - Kim Nam Gil - Bad Guy (SBS)**\n\nBack in 2010, as a newbie in kdramaland, I received a thorough lesson on the craziness of the live-shoot production system when the SBS drama **Bad Guy** lost its male lead actor Kim Nam Gil -- the titular 'bad guy' -- in the midst of the drama due to KNG being [summoned](https://www.dramabeans.com/2010/06/kim-nam-gils-army-enlistment-endangers-bad-guy/) for his mandatory military service. This resulted in the drama [being cut](https://www.dramabeans.com/2010/07/is-bad-guy-in-danger-of-an-early-cut-off/) to 17 episodes from the initially planned 20 episodes and KNG's stand-in actor getting some [close up shots](https://www.dramabeans.com/2010/08/kim-nam-gils-double-gets-face-time-in-bad-guy/).\n\n**2011 - Han Ye Seul - Spy Myungwol (KBS)**\n\nAnd that wasn't the only drama whose titular character's actor went missing in the midst of the drama's run. Back in 2011, Han Ye-seul [did not show up](https://www.dramabeans.com/2011/08/kbs-speaks-about-myung-wol-the-spys-future-at-press-conference/) for her scheduled filming by flying to her home in the United States -- in apparent protest to the tight, stressful drama production environment. According to statements released by her side, back when it was still unclear why she did not show up, her shoots had gone so far into the night that she only had [two hours](https://www.dramabeans.com/2011/08/myung-wol-the-spy-unable-to-complete-shoot-to-air-special/) after being released before her next day\u2019s call time. Though she faced criticism at the time for her unprofessionalism, in retrospect her actions did contribute to greater criticism of the live-shoot production schedule.\n\nAs a bonus, the reports about the [variable number](https://www.dramabeans.com/2011/08/myung-wol-the-spy-gets-an-extension-sort-of/) of episodes of the drama was an interesting peek into how not fully planned dramas are from the beginning under the live-shoot production system.\n\n**2018 - Go Hyun Jung - Return (SBS)**\n\nSurprisingly this drama was my first experience in kdramaland where a character's actor was switched mid-drama. I remember following the news in real time when the original female lead actress Go Hyun Jung left the production citing creative differences to be [replaced](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20180213001800315) by Park Jin Hee. One week I was watching one actress as the female lead character and the next it was a different actress. While it threw me off at first, I still ended up enjoying the drama.\n\n**2019 - Choi Jin Hyuk - The Last Empress (SBS)**\n\nTo wrap up this section, I'll end with a relatively 'happy' example where the disappearance of a key cast member was due to the scheduling conflicts. Choi Jin Hyuk was second male lead so he had a fairly weighty character but when the drama got extended, the extension [conflicted with](https://www.soompi.com/article/1303870wpp/choi-jin-hyuk-unable-to-appear-in-final-episodes-of-the-last-empress-due-to-schedule) his existing schedules so he was unable to film for the extended episodes. This meant some scripting magic to account for his disappearance in the final episodes.\n\n# The Importance of Post-Production!\n\nOne of the biggest victims of live-shoot production is that post-production suffers due to the tight schedule.\n\n&gt;Normally, production companies in the past prepared two tapes before broadcast - one for actual airing, and one as a spare. Things have changed recently. \u201cThese dates, it\u2019s normal to have seven tapes per episode for a 70-minute miniseries,\u201d said a network source. \u201cThey edit it into 10-minute segments and send it off to the network right away.\" *from* [2013 Hankyoreh article](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_entertainment/590405.html).\n\n**2011 - Sign (SBS)**\n\nFinale episode was [plagued](https://www.dramabeans.com/2011/03/sign-apologizes-for-glitchy-finale-promises-a-do-over/) with post-production editing issues including: audio cut in and out and an error screen with color bars was sent up halfway through. Apparently because \"the shoots themselves ran so late that they were filming up to THE HOUR before airtime. The director tweeted at 9:20 pm that night (*Sign* was a 10 pm drama) that they\u2019d just finished the last shoots.\"\n\n**2017 - Hwayugi (tvN)**\n\nSometimes dramas just [aren't ready](https://www.soompi.com/article/1097893wpp/tvn-apologizes-broadcast-post-production-issues-2nd-episode-hwayugi) as in the case of **Hwayugi** which suffered numerous post-production issues at the beginning of its broadcast.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe broadcast of the second episode of \u2018Hwayugi\u2019 on December 24 did not go smoothly due to delays in post-production. We would like to sincerely apologize for making viewers feel uncomfortable, and we will do everything\u00a0possible to make sure an incident like this does not happen again.\u201d\n\nIssues included an extended commercial break before the episode began and the episode broadcast suddenly cutting off with a caption that read, \u201cWe will be ending this broadcast due to internal issues.\u201d\n\nThe episode itself had green screens and unhidden wires -- fully demonstrating how good CG is needed for immersion.\n\n**2019 - Big Issue (SBS)**\n\nAnother case of [CG errors](https://www.soompi.com/article/1311837wpp/sbss-big-issue-apologizes-for-cg-errors), this one though was enlightening to see how much CG is needed even for non-fantasy series.\n\n# Writers and PDs Come and Go\n\nIf you have seen Reply 1997, there is a small story arc involving FL's mother who &gt;!constantly phones the writer of a currently airing drama to beg the writer to change the direction of the story to bring hope for her husband who was hospitalized!&lt; and succeeds in her efforts. While in reality one viewer cannot exert such influence, it is undeniable that audience reaction has resulted in scripts being adjusted or completely rewritten. Sometimes this means that writers and even PDs get switched out! (Though this does not always result in a fiasco in terms of the resultant drama, the PR department certainly works overtime.)\n\n**2015 - The Producers (KBS) - Director Switch**\n\nDrama underwent a [director change](https://www.soompi.com/article/732773wpp/viewers-can-expect-a-new-style-after-directorial-switch-in-producer-starting-this-week) early on in its run, switching from a relative rookie to a more seasoned director. The switch is often 'credited' as the source of change in the drama's tone and style from something experimental (fake docu-variety) to traditional romantic comedy.\n\n**2021 - The Uncanny Counter (OCN) - Writer Switch**\n\nDrama underwent a [writer change](https://www.soompi.com/article/1449073wpp/the-uncanny-counter-announces-unexpected-departure-of-writer-midway-through-show) in its latter half due to differing opinions on the direction of the story.\n\n**2021 - Taxi Driver (SBS) - Writer Switch**\n\nDrama underwent a [writer change](https://www.soompi.com/article/1469611wpp/taxi-driver-announces-writer-change-midway-through-show) around midway, also due to differing opinions on the direction of the story.\n\n# Kdramas About Live-Production of Kdramas\n\nWith all the IRL drama that takes place behind the scenes of kdramas, it should come as no surprise that the drama about kdrama production has been fictionalized in various kdramas. My personal recommendation of *the* kdrama to watch for kdrama-meta is the 2012 SBS kdrama **The King of Dramas** ([\ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8\uc758 \uc81c\uc655](https://mydramalist.com/4996-the-king-of-dramas))! If nothing else, watch just the first episode to get a great intro into the craziness of live-production and PPL, along with a primer on the effects of the first wave of Hallyu.\n\nWhile there are undoubtedly other great meta-kdramas about k-entertainment industry, I think **The King of Dramas** stands out not only for its great cast but also because of how it focuses on the state of the industry in the late 2000s and early 2010s when live-shoot production of kdramas was essentially at its peak. Other dramas in the following years is tackling an industry that has changed, though some things stay the same (such as the need to incorporate PPL).\n\nAlternate Title: **King of the Drama** (such as on Kocowa).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe above are just some of the memorable incidents stemming from live-shoot productions. I haven't covered extensions and truncations in detail as there are too many examples and certainly some of them fiascos I wish I can erase from memory. I also haven't covered examples of casting switches mid-broadcast due to allegations of crime as I do not feel like delving into those people.\n\nAnyways, I love that the overall trend towards pre-production (or at least not so much ***live*** live-shoot production) has meant a drastic decrease of headlines involving actors and actresses being hospitalized or competing about who has gotten more IV drips. I hope the trend holds up and working conditions continue to improve.",

I remember Descendents of the Sun was one of the first dramas to be 100% pre produced, and because of that they were having trouble casting the male lead because no one really wanted to make such a big time commitment. \n\nRecently the pendulum seems to have swung a bit too far in the pre produced drama direction, especially with more dramas being produced for OTT services. I just saw an article that said there were more than 70 dramas produced last year that may never be aired because there's no time or place to show them.",

            "comment": "How dare you mention live shoot production mishaps and not include the legendary \"Dragon's Fist\" LMFAO. Because of that incident, sageuk dramas stopped being live shot mere hours before airing...\n\nBasically, in \"The King And I\" in 2007, which was shooting under abysmal time schedules and crazy pressure, seasoned sageuk actress **Jeon In-hwa** who played the Queen Dowager used to come home every night and complain to her husband, **Yoo Dong-geun** (a.k.a the man who hard-carried the best traditional sageuk of modern times, \"Tears Of The Dragon\" and probably the most famous 70s-80s-90s sageuk actor) that she cannot cope with the schedules, cannot practice properly, and feels like quitting. Note that she had done almost 15 sageuks by then from 1988 to then, so those are like 20 years experience. He says alright honey I'll come with you tomorrow and check it out.\n\nSo they both go to the shooting set and it's exactly how she says it was : actors recieveing their script mere minutes before filming, and the episodes going on air just one or two days after. The actors can't immerse themselves into their character, there's a lot of hush-hush and stress for changing clothes etc. So Yoo Dong-geun witnesses how sageuks are basically being fast-fooded and tries to talk it out with the producer and director, and then words fly, and at one point, fists start to fly, and the two are on the floor. Yoo Dong-geun literally pummelled them to the ground LMAO\n\n\"Fist Of The Dragon\" alright.\n\nIt's said that eminent sageuk director Lee Jaehyung (who had directed Jeon Inhwa in \"Ladies Of The Palace\" before) quit SBS after this incident. IDK why but put 2 and 2 together ig?\n\nBut yeah, that was one of the byproducts of the Hallyu Wave...",

The story how they got together is an absolute W too.\n\nStory goes, she is casted as the lead role for her first ever sageuk drama (\"500 Jears Of Joseon - Queen Inhyun\" in 1988), and has no darn idea how to even do a historical drama because she was famous for being the \"fresh new face\". Weeks ahead of shooting, some senior actors refer her to another senior who has experience in sageuks to learn from him, and it's Yoo Dong-geun a.k.a. future husband.\n\nShe starts taking classes a.k.a goes to his house and learns pronounciation, enunciation, mannerisms and all but notices he doesn't have much work (despite being so knowledgeable), hasn't had a drama or play or movie in a year, doesn't eat and drink in front of her, and basically mumbles.\n\nOne day, she sees him spitting up blood, and gets to hear that he was in a major car accident which basically left his entire jaw disfunctional. She then asks him if there's no one to take care of him in this state of his and he says no I'm just getting by, and she then hugs him out of the blue and says \"I promise that after I finish shooting this drama, I'll start taking care of you\". So she finishes the drama, the drama becomes a hit, she starts earning some nice money, starts taking care of him (a.k.a. buying him medication and spending time with him) and a year later, in 1989, marries him.\n\nBack in the days when an actress married, the public expected her to be a good wife and stop working so she took a hiatus for 2 years, during which he recovered and started working to basically even out the \"cost\" of her hiatus. 1991 she returns and him alongside, so they've been active ever since and haven't taken the L since LOL",

The media portrayed her as the diva princess who was throwing tantrums at first, before news about the long hours and overall horrible working conditions surfaced. So unfair for her. \n\n**Secret Garden** also had the concert part on the last episode filmed \"live\", meaning it was an actual concert performance that they used in the drama. I think the actors were worried at the time, because they were not actual singers and only had one take, unlike in dramas, so they had to get things right the first time. \n\nI'll have to check out **The King of Dramas**. Another drama about dramas I knew was **The World We Live In/Worlds Within** starring Hyun Bin and Song Hye Kyo. They had some good chemistry in there, and also dated for a bit after the drama ended I think.",

I was watching Spy Myung Wol on-air and was a child who lived in Asia so had no concept of the definition of proper working conditions. Now I feel so bad that she had to take a 3 year career break from the backlash. \n\nSuch a pity because I loved her comedic timing.",

            "comment": "Thank you for the post. It was very interesting.\u00a0 I can't even imagine the amount of stress the staff must be under when they finish working on the episode hours before it airs. It is absolutely *insane* and should never happen! \n\nHowever, I am not completely against live shoots, as long as the deadlines are reasonable. \n\nFor example, **The Red Sleeve** added the last episode because of the drama's success and that last episode was by far what I like the most about the show. However, they skipped a week of airing in order to finish it, a wise decision in my opinion. \n\nIt also allows production companies to secure commercial deals when the drama is successful. For example, Extraordinary Attorney Woo had a lot more PPL in the part which was filmed in live shoots. Ok, I know that it is not the best thing for the viewer, but that company was so firm in not wanting to the sell the rights to Netflix, after they got burned with ~~All of Us Are Dead~~ **Kingdom**,\u00a0 that I was rooting for them getting that extra cash from PPL. \n\nI am digressing, but that is one of the reasons why I find the increased prevalence of Netflix-produced content so bittersweet. At the end of the day, it is not the local production companies that end up reaping the benefits of their show's success. \n\nTo summarize, I think that that it is unacceptable to put the crew under the stress of extra-tight deadlines, but I think that live shoots have theirs benefits and, in some cases, have their place in the industry. I also think that skipping a week of airing in order to polish an episode should be a much better prefered option than rushing the staff.",

I was just thinking about this the other day that almost all dramas now and around covid times are preproduced and we don't get any live productions now ! That gives us viewers overall majority of the time more satisfactory and fulfilling story lines. But it makes the ones that flop even more sad because they had the time to produce and pull the story together.",

            "comment": "God if I could give this post an award I could, this compilation is amazing! \n\nIt's so interesting to see how production and writing methods can differ a story. On one hand, sometimes it's barley noticable (at least for me) for stories like **Uncanny Counter** and **Taxi Driver**. Sure a few things may have changed, but they maintained a good enough quality to stay good and be relevant for a 2nd season. \n\nHowever, there's also mishaps such as with **Hwayugi** which suffered immensely with bad CGI and filler. \n\nTo add my two sense, I think the best difference between live shoot and post production dramas is **Beyond Evil** and **Mouse**. Both aired around the same time (Spring 2021), both were in the same genre, yet the quality difference is clear as day. \n\n**Beyond Evil** was immensely pre-planned, to the point that the script book has notes about sneaking in plot points for moments 10-15 eps in advance. Meanwhile, **Mouse** was shoot in a live schedule system, and the scheduling was so terrible that I think there were like 6 different delays, the most I've heard of for any show out there. \n\nAlthough I'm personally biased towards **Mouse**, I can't help lament the drama it *could* have been if various plot points were thought out well through a pre planned system. I guess it depends on the show though, **Mouse** was a plot-based storyline driven show like **Taxi Driver**, so it needed some planning to stick the landing. Meanwhile, I doubt rom-coms or slice of life shows need that leeway to stay great.",

I knew something about live production and how it influences story lines etc but I didn't know all of these incidents.

It's too hard to be creative and original when you're working on those insanely tight deadlines and constantly changing storylines because of network interference.",

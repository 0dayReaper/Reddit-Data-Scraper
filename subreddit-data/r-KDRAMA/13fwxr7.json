            "comment": "I just finished watching \"The Interest of Love\" about an hour ago and oh *wow* It's certainly left an impression on me, so much so that I went out of my way to order the novel (of the same name) it was based on. The shipping I paid for that was criminal and I don't even understand Korean but all of that will fall in to place. It was about time I learned.  \n  \nNow at a 9/10 this is certainly the highest I've rated a drama (At least since I started rating them mid 2022) and definitely the best I've seen all year but ironically I **cannot** recommend it, it's simply just not for everyone. The story stops following a conventional drama's structure after the very first episode. We are introduced to the leads and watch a spark grow but then are also shown it immediately smothered. In fact without spoiling much, we see the two leads together less than we see them with other people, significantly so to the point were you're actually confused on who to root for (And very *intimate* relationships to put it bluntly). This is where the drama (in my opinion) truly shines. Every character is shown as flawed in one way or another. There were cheaters, there were liars, there were liars who were cheaters, and there were those who lied about cheating. This made the drama feel grounded and real because just like in real life were nobody is perfect, not everyone walks away with their dream ending were they get the girl and ride out into a sunset. I loved how in many scenes nothing is shown but somehow everything is shown. Its really hard to explain in words but often times the characters said one thing but through their eyes and actions showed another. Many times the show would deliberately omit scenes just to replay them backwards at later points or instead omitted showing actions while simply showing us their emotional responses.  \n  \nThe whole show just cohered together to perfection, from the cast, the acting, the cinematography, the directing, the script and the soundtrack. My god the soundtrack had so many bangers in it I can't even begin to describe it. Not only that, I'm not sure how they managed to do it but every time a song played, it sounded different. I don't know if it was rerecorded every time or if it was due to the mixing or them sampling a different section of the track each time but the words on the songs felt more like a rough draft that was rewritten every time it needed to be called. At an hour and 20ish minutes per episode we see the lives of two people unfold as they try to make their way to their own versions of happiness and somehow even through all of the character development it stays constant all the way the end. An end which I found very fitting for the record. It's exactly how I wanted it to end.  \n  \nI omitted talking about the show in specific detail because I wanted this to be accessible to anyone regardless of whether they had seen the show or not, but I'd be happy to discuss any thoughts about it. I haven't really gotten a chance to read any reviews/the episode recaps because I just wanted to get this out there but I can foresee many people having mixed feelings towards it depending on how they took the ending/ how they were able to connect to the characters and am looking forward to it. As a side note (it's not really Korean but I'm also late to the party on this so its somewhat fitting still) I also watched the HBO miniseries about Chernobyl in one sitting earlier this week. I thought it was great, 8/10.",

Just recently also finished TOTNT because of season 2 release. And guess what, neither TOTNT 1938 nor Dr.Romantic 3 is legally available now in my region.\n\nNevertheless, I enjoyed both these shows despite having read some critique on both of them earlier.",

            "comment": "This is my favourite recurring thread, as I pick up so many ideas for dramas here.  I have vowed to stop reading Refund My Time because there will always be someone to hate on a show you loved.\n\nNo matter what I watch, I always end back up with a Romcom.  I guess I have to admit it's a favourite genre.  I've also vowed to at least attempt to watch an entire series before moving on to the next, if for no other reason than to stop cluttering up my currently-watching list.  It's also more enjoyable to binge a series.\n\nI am currently watching **Dali and the Cocky Prince** and am really enjoying it so far.  I love the ML both for his character and the actor who plays him.  He's new to me.\n\nRecently I finished **I hear your voice** and adored the series.  I can see why it was so popular.  It's nearly perfect.  I'm debating watching the Chinese remake.\n\nI watched **My Id is Gangnam Beauty** right after watching **True Beauty**. I'm surprised that Cha Eun Woo accepted two roles that were so similar.  I couldn't help but think about Moonbeam's passing while watching True Beauty and felt bad for him.  It hit a bit too close to the bone.  Regardless I enjoyed both.  That man is so pretty it's actually unreal. So I started watching **Island**.  I like his character in that drama.  He gets more of a chance to act.  But true to myself, I went back to watching another Romcom, so it's languishing half-finished on my currently-watching list.\n\nAt someone's suggestion, I started watching **Nigeru wa Haji da ga Yaku ni Tatsu** (The Full Time Wife Escapist).  It has similar vibes to **Because This is My First Life,** but is also different.  I enjoyed it, but it didn't hit you in the feels as much, except for a scene near the end.",

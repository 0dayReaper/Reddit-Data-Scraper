    "postText": "Hello everyone! \n\nIt\u2019s time we increased [our Subway order](https://i.imgur.com/oVUxxyw.png) as our mod team has grown once more. We are very excited to welcome u/kriyator, u/Telos07, and u/Sunshine_raes to the team as our newest content moderators. Our maknaes have been working with us for the last month and have been doing a fantastic job so far. \n\nWe feel so relaxed we feel as if [we can slip off for a picnic](https://i.imgur.com/xgOZM2s.gif) and leave them to [run the subreddit!](https://i.imgur.com/KDSMN3a.gif) \n\nIn addition to our new additions to the team, u/DarkKnight2001135 and /u/pixl3rt are both stepping up and becoming full mods! \n\nWe have decided to leave the [mod application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJdNBODZwrO3VV6J6JkycWDdF5BwUsCEOZtHGwxOZ4wjXw0w/viewform) open so people can apply whenever and select from the pool as necessary moving forward. For now we are happy with the size, drama coverage and availability of the team. \n\nA big thank you to everyone who took the time to apply to join the r/KDRAMA mod team. \n\n---\n\nPlease join us in welcoming our newest mods! Enjoy a quick icebreaker Q&amp;A to get to know them just a little bit better. \n\n**u/kriyator**  (May)\n\n\n*General comment to the community*\n\nHey kdrama fam, I'm so excited and honored to be one of your mods. I began my kdrama journey thanks to Netflix suggesting the cdrama Meteor Garden to me. After binging that, their algorithms got to work and before I knew it, I was falling down the kdrama rabbit hole. Not sure where to turn for guidance, I stumbled across this community and then signed up for reddit in order to interact. So I have kdramas to thank for joining reddit. I'm looking forward to interacting with you all even more and I hope we can continue to make this community even better.\n    \n\n*How long have you\u2019ve been watching Kdramas?*\n\nSince 2018    \n\n*Your favorite Kdrama*\n\nThis is such a tough one but I'll go with Missing\n\n*What do you love about Kdramas?*\n\nI love how they are self-contained stories and so I don't need to commit years of my life to them.I also enjoy all the tropes, even the ridiculous ones. It's fun to have a break from gritty realism.  \n\n*Favorite actor/actress*\n\nCurrently for actor it's Choi Hyun Wook (fantastic couple of years with Racket Boys, Twenty-Five Twenty-One, and Weak Hero Class 1) and Park Ji Hoon (At a Distance, Spring Is Green got me in my feels and he was great in Weak Hero Class 1 as well). For actresses I'll watch anything that has with Kim Hye Soon or Park Eun Bin in it.    \n\n*Favorite genres*\n\nSlice of life, Melo, action, sci-fi, romance...I'll watch anything really   \n\n*Recommendation for new watchers*\n\nNavillera. I tried to go for something that lots of people wouldn't normally mention. It's only 12 episodes but very heartwarming\n\n*Your craziest kdramas made me do it moment (other than joining the modteam)*\n\nVisit Seoul. I did this a year after watching kdramas and it was so much fun. The plan was to go the following year but a little thing called covid stopped that. The other was visiting the Sigriswil Panoramic bridge in Switzerland. It's funny because I never knew it existed, despite living in Switzerland for a few years and so during covid I took a trip to try it out and it was terrifying LOL.\n\n---\n\n**u/Telos07** (Telos)\n\n\n*General comment to the community*\n\nG'day to all of the members of this wonderful subreddit! There have been many times when I've been tempted to comment on how much I love this community, which speaks volumes for the excellence of the work that the modteam does, and which we as newbie mods aspire to maintain.    \n\n*How long have you\u2019ve been watching Kdramas?*\n\nLike so many people around the world, I got into Kdramas at the start of the pandemic, around three years ago. \n\n*Your favorite Kdrama*\n\n2022 was a very special year in Kdramaland. There was Twenty-Five Twenty-One, with its perfect blend of friendship, sport and a retro setting. The same week it finished airing, along came My Liberation Notes, with its beautiful slice-of-life vibes in the fields of Sanpo.\n\n*What do you love about Kdramas?*\n\nPretty much everything. The best Kdramas feature performances that evoke deep emotional responses from the viewer, engaging storylines, outstanding production values and unforgettable OSTs.   \n\n*Favorite actor/actress*\n\nIn line with my favorite Kdramas listed above, I would have to say Kim Tae Ri and Kim Ji Won.    \n\n*Favorite genres*\n\nSlice-of-life, coming-of-age, school dramas and office dramas (bonus points if they have a retro setting.)   \n\n*Recommendation for new watchers*\n\nThe world of Kdramas is your oyster! Explore it widely, both in terms of watching a variety of genres and older and newer dramas.\n\n*Your craziest kdramas made me do it moment (other than joining the modteam)*\n\nMaking a late-night visit to Koreatown on a weeknight... for the sole purpose of buying Kopiko candy.\n\n---\n\n**u/Sunshine_raes** (sunshine)\n\n\n*General comment to the community*\n\nHello! I'm happy to help this community to continue to be a fun place to discuss all things Kdramas! \n    \n\n*How long have you\u2019ve been watching Kdramas?*\n\nI've been watching Kdramas since mid-2020. I, like so many others, was convinced by Netflix to watch Crash Landing on You during the start of the pandemic and I've never looked back. \n    \n\n*Your favorite Kdrama*\n\nMr. Queen. I was going to say \"Oh there are so many that I love\" but Mr. Queen is my obvious favorite. Romance + action + comedy + Shin Hye Sun's pure genius = my favorite. Sorry all other dramas.\n\n\n*What do you love about Kdramas?*\n\nAs a reader of romance novels, I enjoy all the tropes in romance dramas and love stories. I love when writers have fun and put their own spin on the romance formula. I like the contained season format and that there is a narrative that ends in 16 episodes (usually). I also enjoy the sincerity and hopefulness of many of the stories that also still manage to touch on difficult themes or societal problems. \n  \n\n*Favorite actor/actress*\n\nShin Hye Sun (see above comment/obsession with Mr. Queen, can't wait for See You in My 19th Life!!) \nJung Hae In- He picks interesting roles and does them so well. \nHonorable mentions to Seo In-Guk and Jun Ji Hyun. \n    \n\n*Favorite genres*\n\nRomance is my thing!\nI do enjoy a good action drama, crime/political thriller, or slice of life but romance is by far my favorite genre. \n   \n\n*Recommendation for new watchers*\n\nMr. Queen, obviously: it's got a little something for everyone, HOWEVER, you have to give it at least 5-6 episodes, which many newbies may not want to do. Business Proposal would also be a fun newbie drama that is easy to get into. \nA non-romance suggestion would be either Vincenzo, Stranger 1, or Happiness. A wildcard: Snowdrop because it's just so good but it might not be everyone's taste. \n\n\n*Your craziest kdramas made me do it moment (other than joining the modteam)* \n\nDefinitely doing Zumba in my classroom at lunchtime, thanks to Choi Myung Hee from Vincenzo. She was a dastardly, brilliantly evil lawyer but I appreciated her no shame attitude towards Zumba at work. And yes, co-workers did walk in on me and yes, it was very embarrassing but I continued to do it anyway because it was fun.",

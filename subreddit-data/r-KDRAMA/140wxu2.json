These dramas often deal with themes like morality, good and evil, love and marriage (and infidelity), and family issues. Characters might be stereotypes or stock types.\n\nYou are invited to share short (or long) reviews of dramas you have watched that fit the topic of this post and an explanation of why you think the drama deserves the spotlight, including whether you would recommend the drama or not.\n\nOur suggested format/structure for comments is:\n\n**Drama Name**\n\n* **Good Things**: about the drama, \n\n* **Bad Things**: about the drama\n\n* **Interesting Things**: about the drama\n\n* **Spotlight On Because**: explain why you think the drama deserves the spotlight, including whether you would recommend the drama or not.\n\nWe strongly encourage you to share your MDL profile so that others can compare their tastes with yours to get a better understanding of preferences and dislikes, which will help in understanding if the feedback provided is applicable for them.\n\nPlease remember that every individual watching goes in with their own life experiences and biases so not everyone will see the drama in the same light or enjoy it in the same way.\n\n**Just because someone did not enjoy a drama that you loved is not a slight against you as a person.**\n\nWhen participating in this discussion please remember that whilst dramas do not have feelings, human beings do. ***Be kind to one another.***\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or anything you think should be redacted.** If you are using Markdown and not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

            "comment": "**The Smile Has Left Your Eyes** tells the story of Moo Yeong, a heartless sociopath who is the prime suspect in a murder, and his love affair with Jin Kang, the sister of a police officer who is investigating the case. \n\n**Good Things:** This drama is melo to the max, a Greek tragedy with murder, dark secrets and characters you'll fall in love with despite their, herm, questionable behavior.  Seo In Guk delivers a career best performance as Moo Yeong. He's the most morally gray male lead you'll ever see in a Kdrama, yet he somehow manages to make this character deeply compelling and even sympathetic despite his crimes. He has incredible chemistry with Jung So Min as the woman who can't help being drawn to Moo Yeong despite knowing how dangerous he is and Park Sung Woong as her detective brother who has secrets of his own. \n\n**Bad Things:** TSHLYE is an adaptation of the Japanese drama Sora Kara Furu Ichioku no Hoshi which features an insanely morally transgressive plot twist: **(MAJOR SPOILER)** &gt;!the leads discover they are brother and sister and have committed incest and they die in a murder-suicide.!&lt; The Korean version took out that plot twist for completely understandable reasons but as a result the story doesn't make much sense in the final episodes. Th e behavior of the brother in particular becomes completely baffling as a result of the script changes.\n\n**Interesting Things:** This was Seo In Guk's first drama after he was exempted from the military because of a congenital bone disease and he had to apologize to the Korean public at the press conference launching the series.\n\n**Spotlight On Because:** This is uniquely dark and amoral for a Korean drama and as a result I think it hasn't gotten the praise it deserves. Despite the plot weirdness at the end this is a high quality drama with phenomenal performances that will stay with you a long time after you've finished watching. And like all good melodramas it will make you cry your eyes out. \n\n**My longer review:**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/odiad0/the\\_smile\\_has\\_left\\_your\\_eyes\\_review\\_brilliant/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/odiad0/the_smile_has_left_your_eyes_review_brilliant/)\n\n**My MDL:** [https://mydramalist.com/dramalist/lilili](https://mydramalist.com/dramalist/lilili)",

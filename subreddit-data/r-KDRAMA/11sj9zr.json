    "postText": "Wow. I haven't written a review for a kdrama in probably about 2 years but this drama was SO EXCEPTIONAL that I felt I needed to write a review. And I just finished the drama like 15 minutes ago...so if that doesn't make you go watch it asap... \n\nImmediately, this drama reminded me of D.P. It's not about the Korean military but it has action and fighting as the focus in a similar way. The camera work in both dramas so clean. The writing is also tight with no storylines lagging due to the same 8 episode structure. And Weak Hero's protagonist, like D.P.'s Jun Ho, is so righteous and endearing that you can't help but root for him. \n\nThe story centers around Yeon Si Eun, a quiet high school student who is top of his class in math. He's always studying but isn't arrogant about his intelligence. After becoming a target of bullies, he uses his wits and some help from experienced boxer, An Soo Ho to fight injustice. \n\nPark Ji Hoon plays Si Eun and I had never seen any of his dramas before this one. I didn't know Ji Hoon was an idol either but you can't tell at all since his is acting is so natural. One of Si Eun's trademarks is his glare and Ji Hoon portays subdued rage really well. But Ji Hoon also brings a tenderness to his role. Si Eun never comes across at cocky. In fact, we see how thoughtful he can be through Ji Hoon's stuble body lanauge and line delivery. \n\nChoi Hyun Wook plays An Soo Ho and this was such a different role for him! I had watched Racket Boys and 25/21 and he plays more shy or happy characters in those dramas. Here, An Soo Ho is a super confident boxer who is also the comedic relief. This role is more mature than Hyun Wook's past roles but he doesn't feel like a rookie actor despite his young age. Hyun Wook balances humor and serious in action scenes, making the audience laugh but also stay engaged in what's going on. He also brings a great outgoing energy to the storyline since the other male leads are more introverted. \n\nHong Kyung plays Oh Beom Seok, a new transfer student and the final friend in the trio. At first Beom Seok seems like a potential background character but Hong Kyung does an amazing job portraying Beom Seok's shy nature with authority. Even in his first scenes, you can't help but be curious and pay attention to him. Hong Kyung also has subtle facial expressions that are fun to pick up on when listening to the other male leads chat away. I had never seen any of Hong Kyung's dramas before but I saw he's in that new devil drama with Kim Tae Ri so I will definitely have to watch! \n\nAlso! Shout out to Kim Su Gyeom for portraying the main bully, Young Bin! Another up-and-coming actor I hadn't seen before and he was amazing. \n\nThe drama is focuses on school bullying but also delves into violence students might experience outside of school making the plotline diverse and unpredictable. I was never bored. Due to the high amount of violence featured it is rated 18+ but the violence never feels showy. The drama has a clear moral theme and everything feels very intentional. \n\nWeak Hero, Class 1 got renewed for a second season so check it out before then!! :)",

I haven't read the webtoon, but the acting was so good \u2014 each of the actors really became one with their character. They really are worth keeping an eye out for. \n\nI also especially liked the overall tension between good and bad and the constant reexamination of the concepts of hero and antihero. \n\nDefinitely can't wait for the second season! \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40",

The middle part of the series is where the main protagonist stops using his wits to solve problems and it's kind of meh for me. Then I got invested again in the last part where there's a conflict between the three friends.\n\nActing is okay I guess. My main issue is I feel like the main protagonist always looks like he's about to cry and his mannerism seems too \"dramatic\" and \"for the camera\". It feels a bit unnatural.",

I'm curious now as to what your take on good acting is, because everyone says this had some of the best performances of the year, hmm...\n\nAnd the main lead is literally SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE HE'S ABOUT TO CRY so there's no fault there, imagine someone constantly bullying you when you're already traumatised by your past and they just wont leave you alone. Idk about you but it's happened for me before that i get too overwhelmed which brings tears to my eyes, and Park Jihoon nailed that emotion really well",

His eyes throughout the entire series were so perfect. Completely dead and lifeless but then he'd switch up and there's this beautiful softness in his gaze as well. When he smiled, it just made my heart melt.\n\nBut overall though it was really riveting. Loved the fight scenes, the music and all the main actors delivery.\n\nEdit: Just thinking on those fight scenes again, superb!",

Oh Beom Seok continued to run away from his problems and Young Yi unnecessarily took his words seriously and broke off her relationship with the group.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Too further the plot, it makes sense that the Oh Beom Seok's dad stays in power but I would've liked some sort of win for Si Eun (maybe something with his parents). !&lt;\n\nHopefully a season 2 will have a stronger and more satisfying closure.",

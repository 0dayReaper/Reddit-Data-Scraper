    "postText": "Hello, everybody!\n\nHere we are at another community milestone. If our community was a city, we would be somewhere between Jeju (Jeju Province) and Pohang (North Gyeongsang). Our local economy is based in camaraderie, conversations, and memes rather than oranges (like Jeju), though. No produce exports for us!\n\nWe (mod team) have moved to subscriber announcements at every 50k step rather than 25k in the past. This is the first one that skips a 25k mark (425k). We went from 400k to 450k in 4 months. Not bad!\n\nThank you for joining us and thank you for making this little corner of reddit your k-drama home! There are lots of discussions and threads to jump into, so don't be shy! Check out our scheduled posts if you like a bit of structure. Those are colored slightly darker than the rest. Example [**here**](https://i.imgur.com/JVgl5gx.png).\n\n*****\n*****\n\nAs always, if you'd like to get a feel for what our community is like and what things get posted where, take a look at our sidebar (on the right if you're using a desktop browser) and our subreddit wiki for specific Korean drama and /r/KDRAMA resources. The wiki has drama FAQs, cultural resources in dramas, a complete list of our scheduled and featured posts, rules, and all you need to learn the ropes (especially if you're new to watching k-dramas). Check our guide as well!\n\nEveryone please continue to stay safe, take care, and remember:\n\nLove (is the moment),\n\nLife and the Mod Team\u2122",

    "postText": "The census made me think about how I got into watching dramas, so I thought I would pose the question for all of you too!\n\nAt first, I thought I became aware of kdramas because my dad watched the dub of Squid Game and I made my whole family watch Parasite for my birthday. But, it was really because I started watching anime with my little sister! She's a huge anime fan, but never has anyone to talk to about it. Really I watched them with her so we could bond more. We were never really that close because of our age gap (7 years!). Then, I started watching anime on my own and through that Netflix recommended Boys Over Flowers. The rest is history! If I'm counting right I've watched over 45 dramas since then. I'm hooked!\n\nSo that's my story! What's yours?\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who responded! I don't think I can reply to everyone, but I'm definitely reading as many as I can. Everyone's stories are so cool to read!",

            "comment": "I'm a widow and I didn't find out about these dramas until almost 15 years after my husband died. This was in November of 2022 that I found k-dramas. Watching them brings back so many happy memories and I am able to laugh and feel like I'm in my body again after all these years. I think about what love means and I find this very healing. I watch certain ones over and over again Encounter Healer, Itaewon Class, CLOY and others. I must have watched at least 100 by now. I make rugs while I'm watching. I'm learning Korean so I can better understand whether the translations are good or not. I also begin to understand the Korean grammar by the mistakes that are made in the translations. I use my Korean keyboard to translate certain words. I wish all the programs had Korean subtitles but many of them don't and this makes it more difficult. I'd like to know where to get the scripts so I can follow along reading the Korean. One thing that happened in November and December is that I found my strength again as a woman and this is part of me returning to my body in a different way. I have lots more to say and I would love to do a glazierian classic grounded theory study of people who watch these dramas as I haven't seen such a study anywhere. I recently went to the exhibition at the V&amp;A and was disappointed that none of the actors were mentioned just the photos of them and mostly the focus on directors and writers. I really enjoyed watching young actors retreat because some of my favourites are in it and it's lovely to see how they are in almost real life. I wish I had the opportunity to thank everyone involved in making these fantastic shows. Thank you for reading.",

I cried watching it, how can one not cry?\n\nI cried watching all the episode and when it was over I felt hollow, could I ever find anything to replace the feeling that this show gave me?\n\nEver since 2017 I\u2019ve been a kdrama fan and I\u2019m gonna be one for life. The amount of heart and emotional drama these show give us is something I haven\u2019t been able to find anywhere else.\n\nThis beautiful life\u2026",

There are many kdramas that I cant go past 1 episode but I find that I have better luck finding good dramas with certain actors or directors maybe because they are given the better projects.  I did that too with hollywood shows ( Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, Matt Damon, Bradd Pitt, Jennifer Anniston, etc)  but not sure why hollywood has not produced a new crop of compelling younger actors. Maybe because of the financing changes. \n\nI think Kdramas are like watching hollywood shows from 50s to the 90s. Relationships are about love and caring and not sex.  Ethics, morality, fairness, character are glorified.  They know how to evoke emotions and that the world is alright.",

A lot of them really struggle to get into the mindset of the era.\n\n*Mr. Sunshine* had just come out, and Netflix kept recommending it. (I love movies like *Lust, Caution*, *Lady Snowblood*--which inspired *Kill Bill*, and *Drunken Master*, so I wasn't entirely new to East Asian media.) So I tried it. And it's still the best show I've ever seen. I cried and cried the last few hours. I loved all the character development, and the political drama made sense--and the costumes and set was just masterfully done. I'm a sucker for a badass female lead, too.\n\nI immediately followed it up with *One Spring Night*, *Hospital Playlist*, etc. I've been in a bit of a slump, but if I'm not watching historical documentaries then I'm watching kdramas.",

It's annoying to be left hanging all the time.  \n\nSo, I dipped my toe into some foreign offerings and found Kdramas.  Kdrama's book format, with a beginning, middle, and an end, really sang to me.  I mean, I may not like all of the endings, but at least there fucking is one.  \n\nAnyway... I've stuck around now for 14 years and branched out into pretty much all East Asian dramaland.

Dae Jang Geum was aired in Iran in 2006 and was popular but i dont think any foreogn shows ever matched the popularity and hype that Jumong received when it was aired in Iran in 2008, people would stop work to watch it. It was all people would talk about. I'm sure there were a lot of other shows before that but I just can't remember.\n\nAnother show that I remember being extremely popular in Iran were two Japanese showd called Oshin ( aired in Iran in 1986) and another called Hanekonma that was aired after late 80s- 90s not sure.\n\nSo all in all I have been watching kdramas for the last 16+ years.",

Since I was interested in high school romance dramas at that time, I watched it and immediately fell in love with Lee Minho.

At the same time I had korean colleagues, I had some travel to Korea and probably as a result to that I started watching Kdramas.",

I know it didn't get good reviews because the story was so-so, but I still loved it.  I didn't really care about the story, it was the love story between the two leads that pulled me in, and it remains an absolutely beautiful love story.  I thought Nam Joo Hyuk and the writers did a great job with the fish-out-of-water God character.  I loved the way he didn't understand the world he found himself in, making him innocent and wise at the same time.  Little things like earning pennies by selling recycled papers to buy the FL two funny cups was so cute.  I thought he was effective in portraying the character as a creature who has lived for thousands of years and yet is innocent in many ways.  Although his love for Yoon So Ah was real, it also stemmed from a deep feeling of responsibility towards her.  She needed him, and he made promises to her, which he was going to keep.  \n\nIn the end, it really did feel like an immortal being, that stopped for the space of a human lifetime, to be by the side of someone who needed him and whom he owe a debt to.",

This is one of the main reasons why I stopped watching Western dramas.  Who would invest their precious time reading a book that the author left unfinished?  Why is that acceptable in a TV series?\n\nIt's a bit unfortunate that Netflix seems to be infecting K-Drama with this bad habit.  I'm not overly worried however, as this should affect only the made-for-Netflix K-Dramas and those I can avoid until I'm certain the ending is not a cliffhanger.

I watched a couple more (*Descendants of the Sun*, *One More Time*, *Goblin*) on and off, but it was really in 2019-2020 that my kdrama watching experience kicked into overdrive with shows like *Hotel del Luna*, *Bring it on, Ghost*, *Crash Landing on You*, and many more. Between kdramas, cdramas, and jdramas, I'm close to passing the 200 mark (not counting dropped or on-hold shows) and don't regret it one bit.",

I think it was in one of those US vs (Insert random country) videos, this time south Korea and it made me want to watch the the whole drama. I enjoyed the show a good amount but while watching it I said to myself this was the only Korean show I was gonna watch because there was a little cheesiness to it like sooo many slow motion scenes. After I finished it though I thought Park Min Young was so pretty that I went on a binge of watching shows she starred in. That led me down the rabbit hole. Healer is now my favorite drama of all time and Ji Chang Wook is my favorite Korean actor",

Having watched nearly all interesting movies of both Hollywood and Bollywood including web series, I decided to try something new. I was already a fan of Korean movies. So, naturally, kdramas appealed to me. Then Netflix recommended me CLOY. You see, both India and ROK have somewhat similar politics. We both are partitioned nations. Bollywood has already made many cross-border love stories before. That's why I found CLOY interesting. After that, one thing led to another and now I have watched over 200 kdramas, majority of them during the curfew period.",

I finished a month or 2 later, can\u2019t remember \ud83d\ude02 \n\nAfter I finished and I said I liked it overall, she recommend **Healer** and THAT\u2019S what sent me down the rabbit hole of Kdramas and I have no intentions of leaving \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\ude77 Ji Chang Wook remains my favorite actor and Park Min Young was my favorite actress for years.\n\nSchool definitely keeps me busy but I try to watch as much as I can in my free time!!

I began watching early 2020 during Covid lockdown here in Victoria Australia as I was totally bored with Western TV offerings dominated by reality TV shows. My first drama was Navillera.

My favourite genres are romance and slice of life. My friends and family all roll their eyes at me. I don\u2019t care because these dramas give me much joy and take me to a happy place.

Anyway, I watched Mr. Sunshine and liked it well enough. Then I watched and really liked Because This is My First Life. And of course many more since. I have yet to watch BoF or The Heirs though.",

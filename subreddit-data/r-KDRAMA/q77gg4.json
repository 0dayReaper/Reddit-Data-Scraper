I'll allow it but as someone who edits I do find most if not all scenes like that are unneeded and can be skirted or done in better ways. Korea does seem to be more aggressive with their movies too, and Squid Game was originally supposed to be a movie if memory serves.\n\nAlso I hope there was more story left untold cuz there's a 2nd season already being discussed, and if there's one thing that annoys me more than tacked on sex scenes it's tacked on seasons and sequels lol",

I do think some other genres could sustain more length though, and they\u2019d be the ones that are less likely to air in Korea anyway. I don\u2019t think Squid Game needs a second season but Kingdom\u2019s two seasons have been good imo.",

My heart sank when I read that. I have not watched any western series since I have discovered k-dramas in large part because I know the stories are contained. Even in the best cases and for excellent shows that I enjoy, I don\u2019t watch more than 2 or 3 seasons (Shitt\u2019s Creek, the good place for example).",

Knowing Netflix though, they probably will renew this show for another season.",

I kinda wish they actually confirmed it was a limited series from the beginning, like what they did with shows like Queen's Gambit. \n\nThen, the director/OG writer wouldn't have to feel the pressure of not really fully having the 2nd season planned out, cause people's expectations would've been already set for a limited series. I'm nervous if they renew it tbh",

Like it is not a genre, kdramas can be anything from historical drama to contemporary slice of life, thrillers to rom-com!

Which means many actors wouldn't have been hired and the scope wouldn't have been as grand.\n\nPersonally I watched alot of kdramas and this while produced well and acted well it was a pretty mediocre kdrama. \n\nLike many have mentioned Signal, Stranger, My Mister, etc there are so many more kdramas that are on par or neigh even better than Squid Games.\n\nIt's great people are getting into kdramas through this venue.

I got into Kdramas because they were very different and I hope they can keep their flavour. As a show, it's not original or remarkably well made. I've read some articles of why people think it blew up so much and the general idea seems to be that it's because it reflects contemporary anxieties of endless debt and hopelessness of having a future, especially for young people. Which, if you watch dramas, are themes in every single one of them, so again, it's nothing new. The colours really pop though. And it's super funny when they play games I recognize from 2 Days 1 Night.",

It's been a wild journey, many thought after Dramafever had to go under/THADD issue w/ China that K-dramas popularity would die down. But Netflix's investment since 2018 onwards has proven to be a huge success, no wonder they invested 500$ million onto K-content this year alone. I bet for 2022, that number could increase to 700-1 billion dollars :O.",

It's nowhere near as gripping -- mostly because the CGI and deaths just end up looking funny. \n\nLike I'm by no means saying Squid Game wasn't good. I really did like it.

It reminds me a little of Snowpiercer, in that the plot didn\u2019t seem all that original but the visual design of everything was really cool and effective at driving home the point. And also a bit of John Wick, in that there\u2019s some kind of bizarro system recruiting all those soldiers!",

I'm the type of person who cries very easily and gets stressed during scary/thrilling shows and movies, but this really isn't that suspenseful. \n\nThat being said I'm glad it's gotten the popularity it has and that Asian films and content are being more widely enjoyed in the West.",

Subtle things like why character x brought character y tofu when he got out of jail, the meaningful significance of changing honorifics, etc etc .. there isn't very much of that in Squid Game, and especially not enough to lose any of the impact. It's a very universal experience. (The only thing I had to explain to my friends was the significance of the masked man. They thought they'd missed something because the reveal felt important and I had to explain that it was because of the cameo more than anything.)",

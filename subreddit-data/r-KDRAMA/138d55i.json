It's become the go-to accusation for any episode of TV that someone personally didn't like.)\n\nI LOVE that they brought back &gt;!the Guild leader villain guy from Episode 1!&lt; and shed some light on his history. And the land use case was fascinating. I genuinely found this episode, especially with how gorgeously it was filmed, really moving at the end.\n\nAnd I like that both Han Su and Yeon Joo are arguing (about things that they SHOULD be arguing about, honestly, and only weren't before because her status was a secret) but also clearly still care for each other and are (behind the scenes) looking out for each other's interests. Way more interesting to me than just getting more eps of fluffy romance which are cute, but I don't want that for the \\*whole show\\*.",

But, I felt that their romance didn't have an adequate build up to justify his response and reaction. \n\nAm also confused. He seems much nicer to the king but horrid to his sister. I thought the king and princess shared the same father... then why treat her like she has failed him massively yet treat the king with respect and decency. \n\nI mean I know she lied but it wasn't such an insane lie either. It's not like she was married with a litter of kids she left in the palace or something. She was doing right by her subjects. Perhaps I missed something.\n\nSuddenly, I find myself leaning towards the SML just cause he is steady, ethical and supportive. Though unlikely isn't he the sort of fellow a princess with her ambitions needs.",

I get where he is coming from but to put so much blame on her is just bad writing. \n\nOn the other hand, Princess LYJ should have told him the truth as soon as she got to know his identity. It only exacerbated their fall out. \n\nMagistrate YJS is just there. I can't feel his presence as the SML. \n\nI was excited about this drama because of the actors but the writing sucks. I lost interest and I'm just watching it so I know how this drama would end. I'm also watching this because of the King. Every time he's on the screen, I always remember Baby Bread.",

I fully understood why Hansoo was that hurt,  and I could not understand why the princess thought he would or should just get over it. \n\nBecause of what happened to his family, he has only been able to trust himself and his sidekick. When he *finally* allowed himself to not only trust, but also love someone, she lied about who she was. Not only that, but she basically left him with the impression that she lied so she could use him to enact her revenge against the man who is responsible for her father's death -- yet another example (to him) of a \"noble\" person toying with the lives of the less fortunate. \n\nAdd in the fact that he knows only that she was supposed to have delivered the letter that *should* have, but didn't save his father's life, and he has to be wondering if she is also responsible  for that. It's a colossal blow. \n\nOf course, the audience knows better, but Kang Hansoo doesn't have the information we have.\n\nGiven all of that, I thought Hansoo's reaction was perfect. I also appreciate that Woo Do Hwan chose to play those scenes honestly and quietly compared to how he normally plays Hansoo.",

Unlike most here, I find that Hansoo's reaction upon finding out that Suwon was actually the Princess was normal, honest and an understandable reaction upon being deceived (vs being mean and cruel). Woo Do Hwan's performance was spot on and I felt that the entire scene where he returned her shoes and wished her happy birthday was beautiful to watch. I could feel his complex emotions of confusion, love, anger and betrayal all at once.\n\nDespite closing himself off to people and single handedly pursuing revenge for what happened to his family in the past, Hansoo had come to trust Suwon implicitly, sharing with her his innnermost feelings of hurt and pain. He fell in love with her and even proposed to her. Upon discovering that she was actually the princess, his entire world collapsed and the future that he had envisioned with her vanished in an instant. Therefore, I think his behaviour towards her is perfectly justified. She is the one in the position of power and she willfully chose to deceive him despite having many oppurtunities to come clean about her alternate identity. Moreover, she was indirectly the cause of the death of Hansoo's family. So that compounds everything.\n\nThere is also a part of me that suspects that Hansoo is also actively pushing her away because he has plans that may cause her harm if she was by his side as the Princess. After all, despite his anger and hurt, deep down she is still the woman that he loves and noble idiocy is still too often used in kdramas. Sigh. Not going to lie, the writing and direction of Joseon Attorney could be better but the actors do a great job and that makes it work for me.\n\nAll in all, this is my first Woo Do Hwan drama and I am very impressed by his range. I may have finally have to watch The King Eternal Monarch after all, haha!",

She keeps telling him that she used him, she never even tries to explain what happened, and Bona always plays her with the same stoic expression.  I find nothing likeable about her. Nothing.\n\nI believe that this is both a problem in the writing and the acting.  I believe that a more experienced actress could have at least made the character more sympathetic, even with mediocre writing. IMO, Bona was woefully miscast. I loved her in 25 21, but her inexperience really shows in this show. I hope she learns to express more vulnerability as an actress in the future.",

I thought hansoo was just being a noble idiot, but the guy really became  a total ass. I hated how he treated her like an emotional punching bag the entire episode, but I truly understand where he is coming from. He lost everything at a young age and was betrayed af. Just when he thought he was finally getting his life together, he ends up feeling betrayed and questioning everything\u2026 but man, the consecutive blow of cruel words. I get seo won was partly at fault too, but she didnt deserve all that!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I dont like how seo won is still chasing after him like a loyal little puppy in the preview for ep 12. I\u2019m feeling so bad for her. I cant wait for hansoo to regret all of this and make it up to her!&lt;\n\nI also cant wait for lady hong and dong chi\u2019s scenes. Theyre really fun.",

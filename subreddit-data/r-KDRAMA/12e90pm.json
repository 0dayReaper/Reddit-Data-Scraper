Do You Like Brahms - the story is a little flawed but the main characters exhibit a unique introverted quality that is rarely seen in Kdramas. I've watched a lot of Kdramas and think it's rare that they let introverts play the star of the show - the girl character is soft-spoken, considerate, and perseverant, and for me personally, it was an easy watch because her aesthetics are conventionally gorgeous in this one and the character is so easily-likeable. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWant to see an interesting story? Hot Stove League - even if you don't like sports (which I don't), it's surprisingly addictive. She plays a strongheaded character who is a well-intentioned leader. It's hard for me to pin down what makes this show so interesting, but it is.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWant to watch a slice of life? Age of Youth and Age of Youth 2. She plays a quirky character who is eternally frustrated about being single and wants to get laid (seriously). But really, the shows are a coming of age story about different college-aged women and how they deal with the problems they face.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOnes I can't recommend in good faith: King's Affection - her acting is top notch but I found the story to be draggy/a little dumb if I'm being honest. Operation Proposal - her first main lead role, but I think this show lacked the charm that the original Japanese source material had, so it was hard to watch in my opinion - to me, it was watching an inferior version of a storyline I had already seen.",

Their performances were utterly memorable, and IMO a standout even in comparison to the other nominees (as far as I've seen)\n\n\nOverall, I'm satisfied with the nominees.

Similarly can't understand why Park Ji-yeon was ignored in the supporting actresses category. Yes, Bloody Heart might not be a masterpiece, but her acting was certainly excellent.\n\nHonestly, it seems like more preference is given to cable and OTT dramas.",

All the amazing work for 14 episodes just over shadowed by 2 messed up episodes. \n\nI think it's kinda the same reason Kim Go Eun wasn't nominated for little women. She my favourite Korean actress because she's so versatile and bodies every role. But the writers messed up the story, making it a forget able work from last year. I think the way they wrote the script made her look weird. But it's still nominated for best drama!\n\nI'm really looking forward to her work with Yumi\u2019s cells.

I lost count of how many ppl were saying they couldn't believe her character would be so naive in several instances. Even great actors like KGE can't overcome a messy, unrealistic plot detail or premise.\n\nSame for Lee Je Hoon in Taxi Driver 2. It's great but it's not the same as S1. Granted this was deliberate but now it has the tendency to pander. It's not faithful to the comic book anymore. \n\nSide note: it's clear that a Yumi's Cells 3 is unlikely to be made. Unfortunately too many ppl complained when YC S1 was being made about \"too many seasons\", so they wrapped it up at the end of S2 with an off cam meeting with the guy she's supposed to end up with. \n\nI distinctly remember reading Jung Hae In was going to be cast as the guy... but now it seems to have all been scrubbed off the Internet. So much so that it seems to be a false memory. Anyway. Be careful what you wish for.",

Imo the first two I listed are slightly stronger contenders. I liked MLNs don't get me wrong, and like a bunch of people I would also be happy if it won. However, I do believe that the winner would either be Our Blues or The Glory, and I bet it would be Our Blues (watch me lose my bet xd \ud83e\udd21).\n\nbest actor:\nLee Sung Min without question\n\nbest actress:\nForerunners are Park Eun Bin and Song Hye Kyo, closely followed by Kim Ji Won. I would bet on Park Eun Bin because her performance as attorney Woo was so incredible, but I could see Song Hye Kyo taking the win as well since her performance was quite transformative. Personally, the reason Im not betting on Kim Ji Won is because her performance in MLNs gave me DOTS vibes and it didnt seem original enough.\n\nBest film: \nDecision to Leave is most likely going to win\n\nBest actress in film:\nTang Wei, she also won some other award in Korea for her performance in Decision to Leave\n\nPersonal hope:\nI hope IU would win best new actress for her performance in Broker. Although... I do prefer her dramas over her film work, personal taste though.",

I just remembered they did this the year Parasite had 10 noms -- it won 3 awards including the daesang for Bong Joon-ho.\n\nMy alternate prediction/hot take: EAW will not win Best Drama but will win the Daesang for TV instead. Harkens back to the year Squid Game had the most noms -- DP won Best Drama, Squid Game had the daesang instead. So maybe The Glory will win Best Drama and EAW will get the grand prize.\n\nAnyway, excited to be proven wrong or right on the 23rd! :)",

I'm a tough audience when it comes to comedy but that drama had me in tears. Just a great little ride.\n\n*Bloody Heart* wasn't perfect but I'd have loved to see a directing nom (it was the most gorgeous drama I watched last year visually speaking) and something for Park Ji Yeon who with Jang Hyuk basically stole the show.\n\nI get that it's to be expected that heavy hitters like EAW and The Glory will dominate lists but it's definitely a little sad to see how many great dramas are totally excluded. Bummed to see Weak Hero get so little (the Park Jihoon snub HURTS) like everyone else.",

Especially because part 2 was comparably underwhelming and couldn't carry the same momentum as part 1. I think in the eyes of voters it brought the series down a whole by a notch. Not me personally, I will always have a special place in my heart for part 1 and the series as a whole, but after part 2 I kinda get why it was snubbed. It didn't end on the stronger note. I didn't hate part 2, it just didn't have the special sauce that made me first fall in love with the series.\n\nI'm not that sad for Reborn Rich tbh. I wanted to understand the hype but it just never hooked me... And then the ending... \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\n\nI've seen 3 of the 5 best drama nods, save for Our Blues and MLN.

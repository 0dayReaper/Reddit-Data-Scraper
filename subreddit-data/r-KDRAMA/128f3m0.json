With only 50 days left before the CSAT, the students have no choice but to sign up for the training, carrying guns instead of books at school.

But I guess it depicts the state of kids nowadays. These kids want to leave the school and go where? Class 2 saw the monsters and the devastation they can cause first hand and where do they want to go... they want to go home, they want to WALK home. When the streets are empty, when there parents are in a shelter... the want to go home. Its a life or death situation and they schemed and tried to to walk out of the school... crazy. The only logical thing would have been if they didn't want to fight, that they ask the adults to let them go to the shelters. But of course they doubted that their parents were in shelters. They literally saw heads lying on the floor come on. So they should believe that there is a shelter. But ok say they go there. what then. How are they going to fight? They don't have enough man power to defend against the threat so they need high schools students. The adults also didn't explain shit properly to the students but still. Trust is a problem, but what can you do in this situation. I wouldn't mind if they schemed and tried to convince the adults to take them to the shelters, would have been understandable. Also, during the combat and chaos, the students act like 8 year-olds. And in the midst of battle you see other dumb shit like people pausing to talk and think about shit. (shows and movies in general) Scary thing is although the the way they act is frustrating it seems that it would not be far off of how many students would act these days.",

Maybe you\u2019re already getting jobs to even if it\u2019s part time meanwhile they\u2019re still in school and their parents provide everything for most of them. So they\u2019re still sheltered and so they act that way. I know because where I\u2019m from people don\u2019t go out into the real world till around the age of 22 so it makes sense to me that they would act that way",

I binged all 6 eps till 4am and now I am suffering at my early morning gym workout lmao.\n\n&gt;!Why did they kill off best boy Lee Chun Ho... like take the bullies instead and bring back our king T-T and poor Yeong-hoon!&lt;\n\nIt's kind of like All of Us Area Dead but slightly more fun, less constant darkness (tho it is mostly very grim with flashes of humour) and with even more annoying teenagers. I like this slightly more because of the military aspects but the characters aside from a few (Lee Chun Ho, maybe Chi Yeol and the class president), they're very bland and all different shades of awful. &gt;!like seriously, Kwon Il Ha is an cruel asshole to the very end.!&lt; but ig that's very accurate to real life since teenagers aren't angels after all. &gt;!i will not complain if Il Ha kicks the bucket in part 2 tho.!&lt;\n\nanother accurate thing is how incompetent, frightened and very quickly traumatized these kids are. they got conscripted into a losing war with barely 3 weeks' training. ofc they're gonna fuck up and ofc they're gonna get fucked up mentally. good thing governments don't draft kids into never ending wars irl anymore. (last line was [sarcasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm)\u2026 mf locked his comment so I can\u2019t reply this to him? I didn\u2019t even know ppl could that on Reddit lmao.)\n\nI'm surprised there's not as much buzz in this subreddit and on other English speaking spaces tbh. I guess not being released on Netflix kinda hurt its overseas popularity.\n\nWill the other episodes also be released at once?",

Also it's weird that they mentioned almost the whole world but somehow in that full year there was no winter?

I found myself yelling at the TV \"You've been in training - you should know better!\" but really they're teenagers so of course all of that goes out the window and panic ensues.

At least from the first two episodes. Like with the two soldiers and teacher that died, the aliens chopped off their hands and poked holes in them quickly. But with the kids they would just shot out their tentacles which seemed to do shit all. I think episode two would have been more effective in showing the danger had a few of the students died right off the bat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso the premise is a bit weird, in the beginning of ep 3, the guy says these aliens eliminated an entire division of highly trained soldiers. The students have very little training still. What else are they gonna do to help except be fodder? I dont see how adding these kids is anything different unless we learn later these aliens have a weakness to kids or something.",

They completely diffuse the danger and urgency of the alien threat by setting them up to be these innocent floaty things for a year. Also there would be news and alarm and worry about how many people died already...to make the conscription make sense. Part of the reason why my suspension of belief was broken is that...these kids are coming back from the shooting range and seeing a totally deserted city and bodies everywhere and they're still acting like...they have a home to return to and everything would be back to normal if they just left training? They themselves don't seem to understand the crisis of the situation? And I don't know what to make of them being told their parents are in a shelter...cuz either that's a lie and the parents were appropriately conscripted and these kids should be aware of that (otherwise why arm them) or...the parents actually are in a shelter, in which case...why arm teenagers over middle aged adults who actually have fully developed executive function? It just doesn't compute...\n\nAnd didn't the minister say...\"we're conscripting men and women over 24 years old?\" What about 19-23 year olds? They gotta go to college still lol? And if they're in such desparate need for warm bodies then why not just conscript the entire high school, why just the seniors? If you're gonna spend so many resources setting up all these high schools as boot camps...might as well train everyone there.",

What many don't know, unless they did very specific history courses is that this scenario with limited sense of urgency is actually true to life and happened during WW1.\n\nThose who enlisted or were conscripted into the military at the start of the war may not have been fully aware of the scale or duration of the conflict they were entering into. In some cases, propaganda and patriotic fervor may have played a role in persuading people to sign up. It wasn't until well into the war did people truly recognize. As the war dragged on and casualties mounted, public opinion began to shift, and many soldiers and civilians alike became disillusioned with the conflict. By the end of the war, the sheer scale of the human and material cost of the conflict was apparent to all. Somewhat similar things happened during the Korean war. .\n\nYou also have to keep in mind that Korea has a mandatory service requirement, so training for the military is sort of part of everyday life. Regarding the kids believing they have a home to go back to, while I also would assume that my familiar would either be completely gone or unalived, during periods of conflict, many people actually think this way as a coping mechanism after being suddenly exposed to such trauma. These are also kids who haven't been exposed to war or struggles of this level, so it's all the more believable.",

But that's why I said in my OP that the *execution* of the premise was faulty...like I had a ton of complaints about All of Us Are Dead since that show also had a ton of annoying characters...but like, at least some characters *actually died*, worked together to survive, sacrificed or betrayed each other in life or death situations. There is just...no sense of tension or danger in this cast at all. If there were then at least I could see the bits of humor and teens acting as teens as little bits of humanity and lightheartedness in dark situations...but it just comes off as the kids being clueless and the scenes themselves feeling contrived and completely out of place. For example...the scene in the shed when the sphere is about to come in from the roof and they can't reach the car key...and then they cut to a scene where they draw straws to decide who to sacrifice. Somehow they all of a sudden have the time to find a bunch of sticks to draw straws and give a dramatic speech, and they do this...instead of using those sticks to continue getting the car keys???? What???? Wasn't the sphere seemingly seconds away from prying itself in????? \n\nIt's scenes like this, where they clearly undercut the tension of the scene by attempts to create more drama, that break my suspension of belief. And it's why I don't see these characters as teenagers missing home and parents because they're in a life and death situation and all they want is to return to a place of safety...again it just plays off as the characters being clueless. I actually think it would've been a great moment of seriousness for the boys to have escaped camp to return home, only to find a note maybe, explaining that the dad and mom was off in some reserve corps or in the shelter, for them to realize that they have nowhere else to go....but no. Instead the drama just plays the failed escape off as a joke...",

How does one alien decapitate a soldier in 0.1 seconds and then another alien can barely choke out a teen after 5 five minutes. Even the way the soldiers are shooting (they're just spraying bullets everywhere) is insane. Are we expected to believe you can shoot a fast moving alien off the face of a student *without hurting the student*? The aliens can tear people apart right? Why were there so many shots of aliens grabbing onto a leg or a foot without them being pulled right out of the socket? The discrepancy is killing me.",

However &gt;! unbelievably, no one from these group of students gets killed. Because of that, I am expecting that they will all survive anyway even though they are weak and untrained.

I really like that they give equal screen time to students, and how their relationship with each other and with platoon leader (and with Won Bin) develop throughout the eps 1-6.\n\n- Plot. I like the idea with alien invasion and the main focus on group of teenagers who was handed guns to fight despite their own will. \n\nWhat I didn\u2019t like:\n- Characters. It\u2019s the main issue for me \u2014 probably it\u2019s just me, but I found it hard to empathize with them. And if I can\u2019t empathize with characters, I can\u2019t really enjoy the show. Maybe it\u2019s due to the first thing I pointed out above \u2014 the amount of screen time per character is limited, so there\u2019re no main leads in particular. Maybe it\u2019s because the characters are not that charismatic, maybe because some of them are annoying and straight to being unlikeable, maybe again, it\u2019s just me. I didn\u2019t even memorize their names except for Bora, Nara and Kim Chiyeol. \nPlatoon leader and Won Bin are lowkey clich\u00e9 without any outstanding characteristics and therefore seem pretty boring to me. All other adults (except for Ms. Park) act so immaturely, it\u2019s just hard to believe. \n\n- CGI. I honestly hate it when in the movies/shows they make the creatures/people/whatever explode once you shoot them. I guess it\u2019s due to budget limits, but I hate it, it really makes it look like it\u2019s a video game or smth like that. \n\n- It surprised me so much that there was just one student in the entire part 1 who mentioned that she misses her parents and that she wants to go back to her mom. After they went out to practice shooting and saw the results of slaughter with their own eyes, they didn\u2019t think of their parents right away? They were angry, they wanted to leave, they wanted to go back home, but no one was scared that their parents might have actually already died? \n\n- Aliens. They ruthlessly slaughter soldiers, poor Miss Park, but when it comes to our students, they first wrap their tentacles around their legs or necks, even tho they could\u2019ve easily jump on their faces or cut them in two like they did it with other people. I\u2019d forgive this for the plot\u2019s sake, because it\u2019s the same thing for many shows, but it happens too frequently. \n\nIn conclusion, as it seem obvious already, I\u2019m not that invested, although still curious what\u2019s gonna happen in the part 2.",

Although it is understandable that it was hot and tiring to carry, regardless, it would have come in handy in such a situation, but they could have used the nitrogen bottle as well, since these creatures can't stand the cold. Then they might not have had to run to the van and endanger each other's lives. Although, say, Soyeon's wound and the lack of food meant they couldn't stay there.!&lt; I wonder how this will appear in the webtoon.",

They show us by telling the kids that if they sign up then they can get extra credit, but as others have pointed out if the situation is as dire as it was like can't the government just forcibly conscript people? Like why lie about the alien situation ? In the show they said it was to avoid panic but like no offence that's weak considering you knew it was inevitable that the death toll would go up and the war would escalae? Because the reason the students were so nonchalant for the first few episodes is because they did not know of the severity of the situation and the military once at camp cut off communication with the outside world (no phones or internet) Do you think having the government and military lying constantly to the students is like a point that the writer was trying to make maybe or just a low-key plot hole? \n\nOkay and like side note,\n\ndid it not feel like at times the military was severely lacking in terms of gear and weaponry? like should they not have more than 1 gun and like some knives? (or is that inaccurate?) and also their communication seemed very bad (like the radios or satellite phones maybe even regular phones it feels like there should have been a more elaborate communication network like should the different units spread out over the country not be in constant communication with one another like giving each other infor and updates? (or is that again inaccurate?) and as it's been pointed out a whole year and you never properly set up or prepared for the eventuality that the spheres may fall or attack you? \n\nand in the 1st episode the soldiers literally shooting at the fallen sphere when they know it does not work or that it may duplicate was just unbelivable\n\nbut I have to say I still enjoyed the show the platoon leader's sacrifice had me in tears!",

What doesn't make sense is that they say on the show that the uranium bullets are scarce, but they draft kids with 1 month of experience to shoot, on the webtoon normal bullets work so it makes more sense to draft everyone you can.",

There's like 2mil+ reserve forces in Korea. After South Korean men finish their mandatory military assignment I believe they go into the 'reserve' for like 8 years and get a few days of recertification/training each year while in it.\n\nThe HS students were basically the '3rd year'/seniors who were added to the up to 24 year old populace drafted. The thing which should have then become obvious. There is no 'college'. Those ages drafted would have included pretty much most of college students since most of them are in that age group and the older ones who were male students who did their 2 years of military service earlier would have been recalled as 'reservists' if they're over 24 anyway.\n\nThe adults are just latching onto these kids having been indoctrinated about the CSAT/College their entire lives and using it as a means to control them.",

I'm loving it so far!\n\nGot to the part about Mulder/Scully and DiCaprio/Winslet thing and I was confused. I don't follow The X-Files, but thought Mulder and Scully did end up together? And didn't quite get the DiCaprio/Winslet part as well, because we all know how Titanic ended. \n\nThankfully, [this comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/13djax2/bo_ra_deborah_episodes_9_10/jjrfnrq/) on the drama's Weekly Discussion cleared all that up, if anyone's interested. \n\nBora's description of the ML in this episode also made me realise what I find attractive in a person's character. Story time:\n\nI was in a subway in Seoul recently (the train, not the source of PPL) and a couple with their 2 young sons walked in. It wasn't very crowded and the dad immediately took a seat next to me. As I was contemplating whether the mum and 2 sons would fit if I stood up to let them all sit together, a man sitting across from me quietly stood up and moved to sit elsewhere, allowing the mum and sons to sit together. Mum was gratefully bowing and saying thank yous, while the man just sort of shrugged and moved on.\n\nSomehow that small interaction stuck to me and I've been telling the story to people. I don't remember what the man looked like tbh, but I like people who are considerate and don't want to draw attention to their actions, kind of like the ML of this drama. \"Nonchalant considerations\" I think is what Bora said about him.",

The train started to get a little crowded and only the seat next to me was empty. Again, the man was the one who sat down immediately and closed his eyes. The woman stood in front of him, one hand on the handle above her head and another hand holding/hugging his head while simultaneously browsing on her phone. \n\nThat really got me thinking if the gentlemanly attitudes we see in Kdramas, even the basic ones like letting the woman sit first, are really just fantasy exaggerated to sell the story.",

For example, I have never seen a kdrama with dialogue as bad as some of the Star Wars dialogue. I know I am reading a translation, but the dialogue generally seems natural and like how people would talk. Except for the occasional voiceovers, but I always make an allowance for that being a translation problem.\n\nSo how do you personally define bad writing and what qualifies as bad for you?",

                    "comment": "With Kdramas, most bad writing stems from inconsistency. So when I'm judging how good a drama's writing is, I look for:\n\n* **Character Consistency** (ie, everyone is recognizable as an individual beyond an archetype and has meaningful reasons for their actions/choices; no one magically changes for plot convenience or through the Power of Love)\n* **Internal Consistency** (ie, especially with fantasy/scifi; a story can make up rules/paradigms/logic but it better stick to them and keep the deus ex machina to a bare minimum)\n* **Narrative Consistency** (ie, doesn't bury its plot under filler or become a different drama in the second half; has a coherent, cohesive ending; events happen in a structured progression to further the story not just to create drama/twists)\n* **Thematic Consistency** (ie, there's a connective thread or a specific journey underlying everything that unites side characters/plots; the themes are shown-not-told through the story/characters)\n* **Tonal Consistency** (ie, if there's a murder in my romcom, there better be a good reason for it)\n\nJudging romance in particular is more subjective because everyone has different ideal/deal-breaker tropes. But overall, dramas that go beyond 'we're in love because we're the leads' syndrome - that actually show how and why characters fit into each other's lives outside of their (usually contrived) circumstances - are the ones that strike me as well-written.",

Egregious examples of out of character behavior are the FL in Because This Is My First Life suddenly becoming a liar and emotionally torturing the man she loves and the ML in Love in Contract going from unimpeachable integrity to willing to break the law for his girlfriend\n* Dialogues that match the characters and also reflect the overall tone of the drama. Also, dialogues that aren't generic: \"I love you more than anything\" vs. \"The first time I saw you pick up a baseball bat and bash in a zombie's head I realized you weren't an ordinary woman and I instantly fell for you.\" &lt;&lt; I made this up but you get what I mean.",

Good writing. (ex. **Vincenzo**, **Gaus Electronics**)\n\nSerious plot points/dialogue in a serious show that still come off as absurd? Bad writing. (ex. **Big Mouth**, **Now We Are Breaking Up**)\n\nThis is a huge oversimplification, but that's how I look at it. If a show accomplishes what it set out to do, then it was written well. Whether or not we then like the end result of that is based on personal taste.",

Like from my recent watch **Kingdom**, the subplot of &gt;!prince's personal guard felt too forced and overly dramatic. I understand it was necessary to solve the queen's subplot and drag the queen's dad's subplot, but they weren't much smoothly connected. Not to mention how quickly he ratted and how quickly the other party responded as if he had a homing pigeon as efficient as mobile phones and they had super fast cars lol!&lt;) \n\n*Too many obvious plot conveniences (esp in thrillers and crime drama. Breaks my immersion)\n\n*Too many fillers that aren't even entertaining (only exception: **Divorce attorney shin**. The fillers were too good to be considered one, even the ppls weren't apparent) \n\n*Drama for the sake of drama ie only present to move the plot forward (annoying love triangles, traumatic childhood connection, problematic characters, amnesia, all those reasons for noble idiocy, stupid misunderstandings, sudden dumbing down of characters and such. One example is third mystery of gongjin/dusik's sad past in **homecha**) \n\n*If flow of events feel forced esp during the end part of the drama (eg. **Flower of evil** stopped making sense once &gt;!the villain woke up from coma!&lt;. However I didn't mind the ending of **ccir** as the writer wrapped it up nicely and coherently even though she actually swept everything under the rug) \n\n*Generic plot, characters, wattpad-like dialogs and actions (most c-romcoms suffer from these)\n\nBtw I am less critical of dramas that do not demand my full attention and are not overly ambitious.",

The air quality here is down to code orange today after being code purple yesterday, so definitely an improvement and I feel like I can finally go outside (...if I want to).\n\nNot a kdrama, but I started **Shiny Happy People** on Prime, the documentary about the Duggars and the cult they are part of. Didn't get too far into it yesterday, but I will probably binge the whole thing tonight. I'm a big fan of cult &amp; true crime documentaries. They're my guilty pleasure, I guess you could say!\n\nI'm also looking forward to new episodes of **The Real Has Come** this weekend since it's the only drama I'm watching on air right now. It looks like (from the previews at least for ep 23) &gt;!they might be acting like a \"real couple\" for now after he confessed and then took her camping. Also, Sejin's father is starting to discover her duplicity (lying about saving Yeon Doo) and I hope he puts 2+2 together soon!&lt;.",

I also started **Our Beloved Summer** after seeing Choi Woo Shik in Hogu's Love and I'm enjoying it so far. I'm planning on starting **Bloodhounds** sometime this weekend. \n\nThe rest of my viewing is Thai shows and for those of you who missed it when it first aired, **F4 Thailand** is on Viki. It's a retelling of Hana Yori Dango, the Japanese manga that **Boys Over Flowers** is based on. But F4T takes the story and turns it into an allegory for toxic capitalism and patriarchy and it's honestly so much better than it has a right to be given the source material.",

I got to the midway point and found other shows I wanted to watch. So far I like it though. The ML has a bit of an uncanny valley thing going on but he's likeable regardless. If HCCC is the anime then **Summer Strike** is the AU fanfic.\n\nOnce I finish,I think I'll pick up **Our Beloved Summer**. Stay in theme with this bright and sweaty, bug filled season.\n\nI still have **The Glory** ,**Hunted** and now **Bloodhounds** to watch but I'll save the dark and gritty stuff for night viewing.",

The reason I mention it is because there is a character that reminded me of a line from Hometown Cha Cha Cha about the FL. I don't remember the exact line but it was something about how she often said the wrong thing but it was okay because she was quick to apologize and realize her error. \n\nThis got me thinking about how there are certain lines from dramas that I maybe don't remember the exact wording but the sentiment has stuck with me. That line from HomeCha is definitely one of them I've thought of many times. Another one is from Hospital Playlist 2(?) when Jun-wan says that he is over a certain age now and he can't be bothered to go out and do more than one thing in a day. I can definitely relate to this as I no longer want to stay out all day like my younger self used to do. \n\nAnyone else care to share some memorable lines from dramas?",

That kind of multi-lingual, multi-cultural career path blows my mind. He has done some good interviews where he talks about the work that he puts into getting his Korean to sound natural.",

I love Teo Yoo and it\u2019s evident he works hard on his Korean because I thought that his language had a very studied quality to it. Although his diction is good it didn\u2019t quite slide easily off his tongue like it does for native Korean speakers. This is my opinion as someone who is non native but is has listened to Korean a lot. I wonder if there are others who thought the same.",

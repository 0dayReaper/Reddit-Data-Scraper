I wonder if it really is the \"best party place in Asia\", as their website claims, or if all these dramas set here are PPL for a place that's struggling to bring people in. In the last year I've seen it in at least three dramas (**LtHY**, **My Liberation Notes**, **Good Job**, and I feel like there's a fourth on the tip of my tongue). \n\nWhen I saw it this time, my first thought was: \"Oh, I wonder if Mr. Gu is working tonight?\"",

I was putting my trash/recycle out today and as I was breaking up cardboard boxes it made me think of seeing scenes in kdramas and it made me wonder.\n\nAre those scenes like government required? They reached out to TV stations (or possibly even financial incentive like a PP ad) in order to remind people to remove the labels from bottles or cardboard when recycling.\n\nBeen seeing the removing shipping labels from cardboard in a bunch of dramas in the last couple of years. Sometimes it can make sense in a certain context, like in Shooting Stars it was part of the 'office tasks'... but there was like this random scene in From Now It's Showtime where lead char and his ghost employees were all doing the remove labels from recycling stuff.",

Korea may be doing the same.\n\nFlattening cardboard boxes - I thought that's just common sense? You'd save more space by doing so and can fit more in the bin. Especially when you share the bin with multiple other households.\n\nAs for removing shipping labels from the boxes, I personally do that because I just prefer not to have my name, address, and sometimes email and/or phone numbers on the box where I don't even know where it'd end up. They may also recycle differently from the boxes as well, but it's not a requirement to remove them where I live and I remove them for different reasons anyway. \n\nRather than government mandated or sponsored, I thought that was more like a PSA or reminder thing. It could also be something \"normal\" that's ingrained in them already so they just include those scenes as the thing people usually do.",

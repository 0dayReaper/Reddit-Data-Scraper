    "postText": "Ever watch a drama where by the time the ending credits roll for the final episode, you start wishing you can get a refund for your time spent? \n\nIf so, come to this thread to [lament](https://i.redd.it/cjahtu0e77z41.gif) about that drama you wish [you'd never watched](https://i.redd.it/y79jjzsnygg31.gif)!\n\nThis post is different from the *Dramas I Have Dropped* post in that these should be dramas you finished watching and then regretted watching as opposed to having dropped the drama midway. Colloquially referred to as *hate watch*. This thread is envisioned for both the completists in our community who cannot drop dramas and dramas that go off the rails at the last minute.\n\nIn order to keep this thread from becoming a vortex of negative energy we encourage our users to share their reasons and reviews as to why they regretted watching certain dramas. This way rather than just hating on dramas without reason this thread can become a constructive place for us all. We can learn from each other and maybe even be convinced by others as to why a drama may have been worth watching after all.\n\nYou are not limited to Kdramas, feel free to discuss non-Kdramas or movies too. We strongly encourage you to share your MDL profile so that others can compare their tastes with yours to get a better understanding of preferences and dislikes, which will help in understanding if the feedback provided is applicable for them.\n\nPlease remember that every individual watching goes in with their own life experiences and biases so not everyone will see the drama in the same light or enjoy it in the same way.\n\n**Just because someone did not enjoy a drama that you loved is not a slight against you as a person.**\n\nWhen participating in this discussion please remember that whilst dramas do not have feelings, human beings do. ***Be kind to one another.***\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or anything you think should be redacted.** If you are using Markdown and not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

I thought would be about empowered women but it ended up being about categorizing women into good and bad.\nIt's a good thing it wasn't the 1st Kdrama I ever watched, I don't know if I would have watched any more.It's so infuriating in so many ways it's hard to put it in a paragraph.\nThe female lead would be playing the Madonna and the 2nd female lead is the W****.This trope continues throughout the series. And the women end up being reliant on men throughout the show.It's just the same tired concept.\nMale lead seems to fall in love with female lead because she's so motherly toward his son.  Roll my eyes! \nOf course he slept with the w****. And was excused for that because he is a man and that's O.K. for men.  One thing that just appalled me was that he gave the 2nd female lead an expensive bracelet after their night together. She accepted it but was later told that marked her out as a whore and he was testing her!!!!!! And that seems to be the message.and tone of the whole series. I mean what the hell in this day and age? I just couldn't believe the sexism and idiocy of the entire series. The women just came off as dumbells especially the female lead. I  despised it completely.",

The ML is typically such a good actor but in this one I couldn't stand him. His eyebrows were permanently stuck in an upward position\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d it looked weird to me haha. The whole ending was horrible and unearned too. The actor for the grim reaper tho was really good. I hope he gets more opportunities even after this bad show.\n\n\nThe Forbidden Marriage- the story was very boring and dragged a lot. Also it was super predictable. Both leads were hard to like too, especially when the second ML was perfectly fine. \n\n\nMy Country: A New Age- how many times does someone need to have a near death injury and then just be fine the next episode? It really robbed the emotional experience of the show. It was just the same thing over and over. Fighting, \"I hate you,\" \"Actually we were best friends so I like you,\" \"no wait I want to kill your dad,\" \"no I want to kill my dad so now I hate you again.\" (Repeat) It was stupid and unnecessary. And I really did not understand the plot at all. I just try to assume it is due to cultural differences, but I really tried and tried to understand why the main characters couldn't be friends and whatnot.",

Thus far it's the same repetitive plotlines as seasons 1 and 2, but we get an extra annoying character who's destroying the core team.",

            "comment": "The Blue Whisperer (cdrama) - I hate watched until it occurred to me that I don't have to watch at all and I gave up about 2/3 through. I just can't believe someone thought a plot where the FL spends 75% of the show being captive is a great idea... \n\nTill The End of the Moon (cdrama) - I'm hanging in there because the acting and chemistry of the leads is LEGENDARY (I'm blushing rn cuz they are H-O-T-T) but the story has so much potential that it isn't reaching - - nobody learns any lessons and it's a frustrating ride that has an &gt;!open ending that many feel is unsatisfying. I'm not there yet, but I at least know what to expect!&lt;. Though it isn't completely their fault, they filmed intending two seasons but China changed their laws so they had to squeeze a 56 episode plotline into 40. \n\nReborn Rich - honestly it was not all that to me but I stuck with it because it was a ratings juggernaut. And then insult to injury with a terrible ending.\n\nAgain, My Life - I love love LOVE Lee Joon Gi but for some reason that drama was a chore and I gave up around halfway. I'm seated for him in Arthdal Chronicles though! \n\nRun On - I remain confused as to how it's as popular as it is, the plot was so so slow, nothing was really going on.\n\nThe Heavenly Idol - I love Kim Minkyu and wanted to support his (first?) lead role project especially since he is now in military. But it was just... Bad. And I was hoping to see him do idol things like singing, dance, or rap and we didn't really get it. The kissing was also not on ABP level. Unfortunately for him, I'm measuring any kissing scene he does against that. He and Seol In Ah set a HIGH bar!\n\nJoseon Attorney - I love my boo thang Woo Do Hwan so much and want to support his return to the screen after military. HE is doing his job very well he hasn't missed a beat because TALENT finds a way, but I am generally let down by the FL and some of the supporting cast. They are SO bland and deadpan and WDH's great acting makes their bad acting stand out even more. While the plot isn't too bad, I was hoping for something more gripping and as it comes to an end I've lost investment and I'm only sticking around for WDH scenes. The chemistry with the FL is really bad and I would like him to get cast alongside a GOOD scene partner soon, not idols with limited acting abilities and facial expressions. I'm actually watching this alongside Rookie Historian and Till the End of the Moon and Rookie has me SO invested in the couple AND the story. And Till the End has amazing chemistry and kissing scenes and love scenes. It just makes the shortcomings of Joseon more glaring.",

Nevertheless- I think I took like 8 months to finish this.. it was just so boring for me \n\n2.  A love so beautiful- this show was so irritating on so many levels, I judge myself for watching it. I was watching a lot of heavy stuff, so thought I will watch a light fluffy k drama, but this was just a cringe fest and so difficult to watch\n\n3. Suspicious Partner- why does this show have 40 (yes you read that right) episodes? I will give it to them- they are all 30 -ish mins, but stilll.. that story should have been wrapped up in like 24 maybe? SUCH A DRAG. The FL is just so difficult to watch (atleast I just couldnt deal with it)\n4. Clean for Passion \u2026 Im trying to finish it, but its just such a trope heavy k drama, like I just cannot deal with this show anymore. Im on the last 2 episodes now, and its going to be a combination of 1.5x + frequent skips for this one \n\n5. This is going to be an unpopular opinion, but I\u2019m having a very hard time finishing prison playbook. I loveeee the show, I just dont know why I cannot watch more than maybe 20 mins of this show at once. Even though the story is good, its not gripping or engaging enough. I love slow dramas and slow burners, but maybe I\u2019m just not getting this show , maybe its all baseball stuff, but I just cannot watch it. Im on episode 9, and I\u2019m really hoping I can finish it by June. Kinda regret starting to be honest, and would just like my time back LOL \n\n6. DoDoSolSolLaLaSol - I dont even want to say anything about this. Just give me my time back, please",

I was really hopeful for this drama, but it felt like it was dragging with the main lead constantly saying she was getting revenge, but without really doing much. Plus, the chemistry between the fl and her love interest was just off.\n\nAnother one that just felt cringy for me was drama called hit the top...least I think that's what it is called...can't believe i stuck with it to the end.\n\nThere are a few more, but I'll come back when I remember the name of them",

            "comment": "**Our Blooming Youth**\n\nIt just never bloomed for me.   Not even the charm of Park Hyung Sik can save this drama.\n\nFrom the writing, the plot, the suspense, the build up of back story, the comedic timing to acting, it was so mediocre and just downright flat and monotone. It just never rose to the level of intensity that I always expect from Sageuk dramas. I love Sagueks because of the political intrigue, the suspense, the villains and the traditional romance. Who can forget the brilliance of \u201cThe Red Sleeve??\u201d I expected more because it\u2019s PHS but he couldn\u2019t carry this drama on his own. In fact, I feel that it dragged him down a bit. \n\nHow can they write such a terrible heroine and Jeon So Nee\u2019s acting made it worse. I\u2019ve never seen any of her work before this and so I don\u2019t know her that much but this drama did not really showcase her acting chops. I kept comparing her with Kim Yoo-jung who played a eunuch in Love in the Moonlight when she was just 16 years old. I don\u2019t really know whether her voice is like that or she\u2019s just trying to sound more manly but it just doesn\u2019t change when she\u2019s only talking to the Crown Prince or with other people.  How did she even get this role because I don\u2019t think she has had meaty or lead roles before this to be paired with PHS.  PHS came from Happiness with amazing chemistry with Han Hyo-joo then to OBY with zero chemistry with Jeon So Nee.   Instead of JSN being lifted up by PHS, who in my opinion is one of the best actors and one of my favorites, she dragged him down in acting. Those dramatic scenes when he cried before the King or when he cried for Jae Yi because he thought she died,  I just didn\u2019t feel any emotions because I didn\u2019t get invested in his or their story. The acting and the build up of their romance were just lackluster.\n\nTheir chemistry just never clicked for me. I could care less about their slow burn romance because I just never felt it. Most, if not all of their scenes, were so cheesy and inauthentic - the rock scene, the shadow, the dressing - which were all meant to be heart fluttering but it just didn\u2019t make my heart flutter. I never got invested and most, if not all, of Sageuk dramas I\u2019ve  seen, I get so invested in the story and in the romance! Their comedic timing is also always falling flat. I much prefered the pairing of Kim Myung Jin and Jang Baram in terms of providing comedy and levity throughout the series. Without them, it would have been really boring.\n\nIn terms of acting, I also got more from Yoon Jong-seok, as the supporting best friend and the Queen (mother of the grand prince), Hong Soo-hyun. \n\nI\u2019m not even going to comment on the plot holes because there\u2019s way too many. I don\u2019t even know why I bothered continuing and finishing the series. It\u2019s really just my love and support for PHS. What a disappointment because this is his first Crown Prince role in a Sageuk and I was really looking forward to this but it just didn\u2019t deliver except for his visuals and wardrobe.",

                            "comment": "oh sure, to start I only started watching kdramas last year in September because of the movie (the call) now in my top 10 movies ever. to start my 2 favorites would be inspector Koo, and my name, and if I have to include something with romance (im not huge on romance dramas which I know is crazy) it would be My id is Gangnam beauty. to start I think most of the problems most people have with the drama Sisyphus gets explained in the end which most people never get to because they drop it before hand like excessive plot armor and weak action scenes in the beginning of the show which later get explained by &gt;!sigma that he was intentionally missed seo-hae and tae-sul  !&lt; another thing I liked that many didn't is that seo-haes character to start is so non-chalant and straight to business which I think is tough &gt;!and made the last couple of episodes better because of how she showed how passionate she was about other things like her parents and the book she carried that tae sul paid to get back from park as well as her opening up and expressing her love for tae-sul, I really think  her character developed from the brick she was at the beginning!&lt; i enjoyed the way seo-hae didnt take anybodys shit including president park , Park Shin-hye is my favorite Kdrama actor and i believe she played this role very well, I also liked jae-suns character and how his determination to being with seo-hae and protecting her ended up &gt;!saving seo-hae in that one episode at the party and how he played into the ending of the show !&lt; some found him annoying and to be appearing \"out of the blue\" most of the time but the way they tied him back into the story was ok. but I think what really takes the cake for me is the plot twist man TOO good of writing in my opinion &gt;!the way President Park went back to see his old self and how he treated his wife thinking that was the reason she and his daughter never came through the uploader and how it lead into the plot twist of bing bing being his daughter 100/10 !&lt; I swear I almost stood up and clapped it was so good as well as how &gt;!sigma got to Kim Seo-jin by having the medicine her mother needed to live and how her older self was secretly living among them in the current time. !&lt;to continue I don't think sigma was the perfect antagonist but his story was really good and the way he out maneuvered seo-hae and tae-sul was really good he got on my nerves and was so smug about it which also pissed me off so id say he was written well even though the actor was meh, but I liked watching him and tae-suls younger selves formed into sigmas hatred for tae-sul . Finally I just think there's a lot of great writing and action towards the last 5 episodes of the show but nobody ever got to it because they didn't want to stick it out (understandably) I don't think this show was perfect by any means I agree with others that the flashbacks were excessive and unnecessary &gt;!the ending episode was really good until eddie kims little bitch fit at the end which was very corny and the actual ending which i will admit was very forced !&lt; but before that i was really glued to this drama and  I honestly think if others would've stuck it out and watched until the end they would've seen the development and enjoyed and understand the drama as a whole because I will say it was very all over the place at first until Seo-jin and sigma explained everything, I truly do believe it got better in the second half and when everything was explained it made it 10 times more interesting , but honestly then they'd get mad about the shite ending again... but yeah I really enjoyed the drama and would recommend it to people who dont mind being patient with it  LMAO",

It\u2019s either the curse of the:\n\n1) 16th episode where they wait until the last minute, rush everything, throw in a twist that no one wanted, and leave a bunch of loose ends, taking a great 15-episode run and ruining it; or\n\n2) mid-way point where the drama starts off exciting and fresh and then starts dragging with all the tropes 1/2 way through or by the 12th episode, so that you end up forcing yourself to finish it. The last 2 episodes may or may not partially redeem the show, but the draggy middle will forever ruin my impression and drop it from a \u201clove it\u201d to an \u201cuhh it was okay\u201d drama\n\nI have felt this way about most 2023 dramas! Reborn Rich and Big Mouse fit into category 1, and Kokdu: Season of Deity, Our Blooming Youth, and Can We Be Strangers? in category 2.\n\nExceptions: The Glory, Taxi Driver 2, so far Romantic Doctor 3 is great, Bo-ra!

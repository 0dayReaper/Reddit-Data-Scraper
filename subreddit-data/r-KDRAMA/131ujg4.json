I'm in such a drama slump but I can't recall there really being anything special about this show so IDK if it's worth it.

Both have great cast of characters and impart life lessons, but I would say that it all boils down to preference.\n\nHP is more character-driven and more of a slice of life so we\u2019d see more of the people than the actual medical procedures. It\u2019s a bit slow-paced too, which is why some people couldn\u2019t get into it. I believe the director mentioned that this show is a \u201chealing\u201d drama so episodes mostly end on a good and positive note.\n\nDR is more plot-driven so the story presents high stakes and has more extensive scenes in the ER and OR. It focuses more on the medical aspects and is more \u201caction-packed\u201d This also touches on some hospital politics for \u2728drama\u2728and the storytelling is pretty much straightforward like other dramas.",

I remember thinking that the medical part of HP was kind of boring because the surgeons do what surgeons actually do which is the same type of surgery over and over again \ud83d\ude02 It's the first medical drama I saw that is actually realistic. The transplant guy did transplants, the heart guy fixed hearts, etc. The only one with a little bit of leeway is pediatrics because they have to be more flexible for rare kid conditions. The driver there was really the friends, and the relationships among the Drs and the patients.\n\nDR is more crazy ER-like emergencies with the side stories of the Drs sprinkled in. It helps that Kim Sabu is triple-boarded and can do all the surgeries...which is kind of like Bruce Banner having 5 PhD. Nobody is that crazy in real life \ud83d\ude02.\n\nI watched S1 for Yoo Yeon Seok after seeing HP, but I liked S2 better. I'm looking forward to the progression of S3 since we know the characters so well now.",

I remember liking the character interactions (especially Dr. Kim) in season 1 but feeling a bit bored by the overall 'plot.'   \n\n\nI will still consider watching it but if this is more of a straight-ahead medical show I might put it on the backburner.",

He reminds me of several people from my med school class in his idealism and reluctance to ask for help on personal issues so he seemed real. The actor who played him did a really good job too including learning how to throw down hand knots realistically. He said in an interview that he went to an university hospital to observe physicians and surgeons so he did his homework. Also Cha Eunjae and his character\u2019s romance was adorable. I liked that they were at the same level of training and slow burn because it was again realistic. If things happened like they did on Grey\u2019s anatomy that residency program would have been shut down a long time ago (staff-resident dating in the same program is huge no-no, and would be sexual harassment)\n\nHave to say that I watched one episode of Season 1 after Season 2 and it was meh",

With this kind of type of writing, we'll often see cases introducing new medical conditions every episode.\n\nHospital Playlist has similar aspects, but I don't think they really leaned into that, we saw a lot more focus on the interpersonal relationships.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Romantic has darker undertones towards it - especially in the second season, which may be appealing to certain people, in the same way that HP's bright and cheerful type of show is more appealing to certain people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd argue HP is more generally appealing. Difference is small-screen wise, you're not gonna get Han Seok-Kyu in TV dramas often, so a lot of people watch for him as well, as compared to the cast in HP, who still do a lot of TV dramas otherwise",

Besides seeing them in the hospital, we rarely see DrR\u2019s cast outside of the Hospital, other than at Dr Nam\u2019s eatery.  HP regularly brings the cast out of the hospital to their band practice, to their meals, etc. We also get to know their families too. \n\nOh saying this really makes me miss HP already. I totally miss the camaraderie among the 99ers.\n\nMost of DrR\u2019s cases originates from the ER whereas HP shows Dr actually taking patients in their clinics. \n\nI feel DrR is the medical drama through and through whereas if you want something not just revolving around the characters, then that would be HP.",

I miss old Doldam though, I hope we get to see them run behind those old wooden doors more often this season. \n\nTalking about our favourite characters, I had the biggest smile on my face when Kim Sabu popped on screen and ofcourse all the slow mos when the rest of the squad showed up was classic. Major props to Lee Sung Kyung who is so versatile it shocks me. I\u2019ve still got Woojoo\u2019s dark cloud stuck in my head and then Eunjae shows up and she\u2019s such a ball of sunshine. \n\nAll in all, great nostalgic start to one of my favourite Kdramas and here\u2019s hoping we get not one but two weddings this time around \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffd\n\nEdit EP 2: I absolutely love all the little throwbacks to the previous seasons.. and finding little Easter eggs always makes me so happy but did anyone else see Euntak\u2019s smile for Aareum?

This has always been just a feel-good drama about a sage old guy helping young people find their way, and helping the bitter old guys seeing life in a new perspective, so I think this will continue that trend nicely. \n\nWith Papa Cha, I really hope they make him just an early antagonist for the show. I can understand some bitterness and resentment from his POV. He basically lost his daughter to his old rival, and he probably doesn't like the idea that she's learning from him, when he feels he's just as capable. In his confrontation with Woo Jin, he made it clear that he loves his daughter, but from Eun Jae's perspective, he's a distant and unapproachable dad and probably someone she wanted his approval for a long time. I think and hope that they get to clear up this misunderstanding and communicate better now that they're both adults and CS surgeons together. I just hope that they don't spend the entire season trying to address this point. Get this over with soon and have daddy-daughter bonding time! \n\nSince we know about Kim Sabu's health condition from season 2, I think they'll probably reach a point where he may have to retire from being the chief surgeon and maybe this is where Director Park and Papa Cha might step in to be the new Doldam surgeons (just my very early prediction). Director Park is definitely a welcome good-guy on this team, and it's nice that they have some stronger political \"clout\" now to help them make the trauma center dream team! \n\nI also really like the 2 new docs coming in. You got one guy who clearly doesn't have the same amount of passion and care as the rest of the Doldam team, so we'll get to see him develop his own passion and patient centered care mindset. Then we got the military captain who like many others were shocked and amazed by the Doldam team, and he certainly has plenty of care and empathy, so I look forward to see how they help him grow too!",

It takes a lot of courage to overcome yourself and respect another person despite your own pride. \n\nI like how he praised the military surgeon for his initiative, considering how he was obsessed with a system and the rules in the past. His character development is definitively the best among the characters. \n\nI\u2019m worried about Woo Jin and his mentor complex. He grew to become dependent on Master Kim, which prevents him to act on his own accord. Even though he is a skilled surgeon, he seems to seek validation from Master Kim who himself encouraged him to not doubt himself. \n\nEun Jae is doing far better in that respect.\nSeeing the Doldam family gather made me excited for the following episodes. We are definitely in for a wild ride.",

This is the first time I'll be watching an ongoing K-drama, so God bless me. I just know that I'll be screaming and crying, waiting for the episodes to air, but I'm ready!\n\n###Thoughts on Episode 1 :\n* Wow, that opening shocked me.\n* Ah, here comes the devil. Director Park, please don't recruit &gt;!Dr. Cha Jin-man!!&lt;\n* Our Kim Sabu has impressed that &gt;!Army Surgeon.!&lt; He will definitely join Doldam soon.\n* Cha Eun-jae is bragging about herself \ud83d\udc80\n* Finally, we have &gt;!a trauma centre!!&lt;\n* Ms. Oh looks stunning in that door opening sequence.\n* &gt;!Trauma centre!&lt; looks pretty expensive. I feel like they'll get in trouble for opening it without approval.\n* Why did Dr. Jang become a doctor if he doesn't want to work overtime? He's really unprofessional.\n* Why is Director Park so hell-bent on recruiting &gt;!Dr. Cha Jin-man?!!&lt; Anyway, I like his character development. I know that it's important for the plot, but please don't take him to Doldam \ud83d\ude44\n* Cha Eun-jae and Seo Woo-jin have been dating for 3 years!\n* &gt;!Ah-reum and Dr. Bae?!&lt; What?! I don't buy it but why it's always &gt;!Eun-tak!&lt; who has problems with his &gt;!love life!&lt; \ud83d\ude2d\n* YAASSS!!! I'm happy that Seo Woo-jin and Cha Eun-jae are &gt;!living together!!!&lt; Seo Woo-jin is so fucking hot!\n* Please get lost, Dr. Yang.\n* Yes, Ms. Oh. Please call everybody's favorite Mr. Gu.\n* FUCK. Dr. Cha Jin-man is &gt;!Cha Eun-jae's father?!!&lt; Why it didn't occur to me that he's a &gt;!cardiothoracic surgeon!&lt; and they're both &gt;!Dr. Cha?!&lt; \ud83d\ude2d\n\n###Thoughts on Episode 2 :\n* &gt;!Cha Eun-jae's father!&lt; is going to be a pain in the ass.\n* \"Who is Messi?\" I was literally wondering about that before Chief Jang said it as well \ud83d\ude02\n* I hope that little kid will be safe. He's really adorable.\n* \"You were moderately pure with some serious craziness\" Damn\ud83d\udc80\n* Somebody needs to whoop Dr. Jang's unprofessional ass. He's getting on my nerves.\n* &gt;!Repartriation?!&lt; Seriously \ud83d\ude44\n* I'm living for Seo Woo-jin stealing kisses from Cha Eun-jae. I hope they won't break-up because of &gt;!her family.!&lt;\n* I love how Director Park is done with Kim Sabu's antics \ud83d\ude02\n* Dr. Kang is really annoying... I'm glad that &gt;!murderer!&lt; scared the shit out of him.\n* Did our &gt;!Kim Sabu!&lt; win the girl over &gt;!Cha Eun-jae's dad?!&lt; I'm really curious \ud83d\ude05\n* So they lied about them &gt;!dying from malnutrition, dehydration and injuries.!&lt; Good job, Kim Sabu!\n* &gt;!Ah-reum and Dr. Bae are back!!&lt; I love Fridays at Doldam \ud83d\ude02\n* Aww the smile on &gt;!Eun-tak's!&lt; face when he saw &gt;!Ah-reum.!&lt;\n* The audacity of this bitch for wanting &gt;!Kim Sabu out of trauma centre!&lt; when he's the one who built it \ud83d\ude44\n* I'm afraid that &gt;!Seo Woo-jin!&lt; might start &gt;!being aloof with Cha Eun-jae!&lt; after watching next week's preview...\n\nI really enjoyed the first two episodes so far but I hope Cha Eun-jae and Seo Woo-jin won't break-up this season because they've been through a lot and I'm sick of that trope.

Jang donghwa, the youngest doc is really getting my nerve. I know that he\u2019s built as clumsy and reckless but it doesn\u2019t make sense to me that if he\u2019s really like that, how did he get accepted to Doldam in the first place? I hope the later eps will clear out my confusion !&lt;\n\nI love to see the new sides of our old characters. &gt;! Park Min Guk panic and run around the trauma center, screaming Kim sabu would never not be funny to me !&lt;\n\nEun Jae\u2019s dad is really annoying. &gt;! There might be a really huge beef between him and Kim sabu that makes him really want to exclude Kim sabu from everything. Idk if this behavior is childish and unprofessional since he\u2019s a god damn old man and a father of 3 big ass adult already. He\u2019s not having any respect from me rn !&lt;\n\nFor Woo Jin Eun Jae, the amount of lovey dovey scene of them is insane haha. It feels so strange but also exciting to see their domestic life. Woo Jin has become so bolder and flirtier haha. Run Jae character is still a little bit underdeveloped to me, hopefully she would get more development later.\n\nI can\u2019t wait for next week. I\u2019m watching it raw without subs and there\u2019s no other streaming service that stream DR3 in my country yet I\u2019m still here counting down every single day to next week.

The atmosphere in Doldam hasn\u2019t changed at all and it still feels like home, although the trauma center has finally been established. \n\nThe details were my personal highlight. Eun Jae's genius utilization of the endotracheal tube. Woo Jin gifting the boy two popsicles like nurse Oh did in season one. Kim sabu and his CTS/MS symptoms. Dr. bae and Jessie and so on.\n\nNot too happy about another dude running around Doldam with a knife again and the excessive political drama, but it is a drama after all.\n\nAnyway, I am looking forward to seeing the oddball project unfold.",

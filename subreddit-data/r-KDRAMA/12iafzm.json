There is a subreddit for this in case some of you are interested r/BeefTV, there are a lot of spoilers there so be careful when you read their posts.\n\nI also watched **Wellmania**, it's really funny and interesting, it is about this woman who is Australian and works in NY but gets stuck in Sydney cause she loses her green card and to get it back she needs to get healthier. It is a very short series on Netflix but it was fun to watch her journey.\n\nThen I started watching this aussie series called **Class of '07**, it is interesting so far but I have watched only one episode and for some reason it reminded me of the series **The Almighty Johnsons** which is a series from New Zealand and it tells the story about Norse Gods that are on Earth disguised in regular people's bodies. So the members of the Johnsons family have Norse Gods powers. The reason one series reminded me of the other was the difference in accents. Kiwi accent and aussie accent might sound the same but they are not. Anyway if anyone is looking to watch something else other than kdramas or American series, i'd recommend those.\n\nAs for kdramas, the last one I watched was **The Glory** and it was pretty good! Nice writing and acting and cinematography.\n\nI am looking forward to watching [Suzume no Tojimari](https://youtu.be/5pTcio2hTSw) which is a movie about a girl who needs to close the door. For those who are anime fans, you should watch it. I am also excited to see the [Spirited Away, live on stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orSsQHqV6Yw) which will be on April 23rd &amp; 27th\n\nedit: bold",

The way the main characters look at each other has me on a grip and the little details people find about the cinematography or the character choices is awesome. I have to say the production company is doing good pr for international fans (I guess that having one of the directors being German adds to that).",

So dropping it probably. For an OCN drama, it lacks a punch. \n\n**Flower Crew: Joseon Marriage Agency:** Only watched the first episode and it\u2019s a nice start. Hoping the rest is as fun. Second Kim Min Jae saeguk now and I think he suits them quite well but his saeguk characters tend to be on the stoic side so I miss his sweet side in DYLB and comedic side in Dali. I like the cast though so that\u2019s a plus. \n\n**Tale of Nokdu:** such a gem and I remember when it aired how much fanfare there was for Jang Dong Yoon. I\u2019m a fan. He and KSH have good chemistry too. Also one of the few meatier roles for &gt;!Kang Tae Oh!&lt;. Oh and spotted Hwang In Youp too.",

It's so much fun watching the girls dance away while also (often) laughing my head off at their expressions of confusion or despair at not getting the answer correct. I'm not good at remembering choreography but even then, I'm having a blast trying to guess the answers myself (complete with flailing arms and legs as I try to mimic the directions).",

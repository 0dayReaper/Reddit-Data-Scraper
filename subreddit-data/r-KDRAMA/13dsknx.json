Going on platonic dates and then ghosting them was his way to build up his self-esteem? Well, he definitely was messed up, and I guess he needed a menace like HaRam to shake him up. That physical attraction didn't come out of nowhere - HaRam knew what he was doing when he kept being touchy-feely with YiJun from the beginning, the sly pest \ud83d\ude0f!&lt;\n\n&gt;!It's understandable that YiJun wants to keep it casual and play it cool, but his heart eyes tell a difference story. The guy is in deep \ud83d\ude0d  I am really curious about how they take it from here. Episode 4 would have been the last episode in most Bls but here it is the halfway point. I look forward to be pleasantly surprised some more \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb!&lt;",

We've seen he's attracted to Haram but nothing more, maybe if he lets himself open up now we'll see him actually fall in love. I loved their night together (it seems that kdramas are getting rid of the \"I'm too shy\" trend?) but they're co-workers and that might bring trouble, even though there's no power imbalance because Haram doesn't seem to think of Lee Jun as his boss!&lt;.",

Though her characterisation isn't very convincing. In fact, most of the characters seem like stock stereotypes.\n\nI guess this also becomes &gt;!a whodunit now. The girl who died had complained against Je-Na. She was the one who refused to accept the expensive gift from the trust fund baby? If so, he is another suspect.!&lt;\n\nThe set up has taken 4 out of 10 episodes. Hope things get going now.",

I didn't say she was a saint. I also don't condone bullying as it seems like you're implying I do. But so far, her actions make her a complex character. She has problems for sure but she's not one-dimensional. She does not bully anyone for the heck of it like the villains from other dramas. She's sharp-tongued but I get the feeling that there's something deeper about her character. You're the one who's twisting my words.\n\nI like complex characters.

She's immature, a bit revolting, a bitch, but totally a mess, but still trying hard to survive and trying to make it in the future. That is so much like teenagers instead of those characters who are just \"so wise for their teens, calm, caring and just plain kind\" and the villain (Yeri/ Je Na) is also not COMPLETELY bad. She is definitely vain and thinks of herself as high, mighty and powerful but at the same time, uses the power to save people as well as to punish people. I love it. I wonder whether her saving the girl getting bullied by 2 others was because she views everyone below her and is like \"huh, are you serious that you have the nerve to bully, you insect??\" kinda feeling or this is going to take a turn into Je Na's life story and some reason that she's the way she is : just \u2696\ufe0f and arrogant. I like that the drama is more realistic. The acting is good and the plot gets more interesting every episode.",

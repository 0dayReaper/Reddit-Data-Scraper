Moon-young drove to the gates of the mansion !&lt; brought back flashbacks of the gate in Guseonwon\n* &gt;! When Kang-tae came to rescue Moon-young under the pouring rain in a motorcycle !&lt; at the end of episode 4/start of episode 5 felt like the scene in the first episode of Save Me with &gt;!

Moon-young throwing an empty can at Ah-reum's ex-husband !&lt; in episode 8 reminded me of the scene where &gt;! Sang Mi/SYJ threw a carton of milk at her twin's bully !&lt;",

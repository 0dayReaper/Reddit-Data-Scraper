I've watched a lot of dark/revenge dramas lately so I was just expecting every character to be a bitch or mean or something in the beginning. I knew this was different as soon as Woo's boss apologized. I'll probably spend all weekend watching this lol. Haven't felt this way about a happy drama since Hometown Cha.",

I'm going to try to go back to **Little Women** and finish that.\n\nBut I'd be lying if I said I wasn't mostly looking forward to new episodes of **The Real Has Come** this weekend to go up because the preview for ep 19 &gt;!with Yeon Doo finding Tae Kyung in the hotel with Sejin made me want to scream!! I don't think he was going anything with her - in fact, I expect the reality is that he's at a hotel, she shows up 5 minutes before Yeon Doo does, and it makes it seem like she spent the night with him. I need her GONE omg but in the short term, my wishes: 1) Yeon Doo gets her phone back!, 2) She and Sejin's dad realize who each other are, so the lie that Sejin \"saved\" her is exposed, 3) More scenes with Tae Kyung realizing he's getting feelings for her. The main couple have chemistry but I need things to start moving along a bit. Like it took 18 episodes to share a bed!! By force!! And he left so quickly.!&lt;",

In My Lovely Sam Soon (2005), two unmarried characters visit a love motel. Kdramas got markedly more conservative in recent years for reasons I haven't been able to figure out, but that conservatism doesn't necessarily reflect real life behavior.",

It seems that the relationships depicted are \"all in or nothing.\" Is casually dating multiple people at once to have better odds of finding a solid relationship frowned upon?\n2. I appreciate light-hearted dramas, but one recurring trope is the infantilizing of grown-up, attractive female leads - pouting, whining, foot-stomping. Is this considered cute and funny by most viewers, or is this an example of male writers' problematic perceptions of how women act?",

            "comment": "There was a recent post about lesser known (at least on this sub) or less-mentioned dramas and it lead me to two standout shows. \n\n**You Raise Me Up** has only eight episodes and they\u2019re only 40 minutes and I loved it. ML barely scrapes by in his basement studio working part time. He is mocked by former schoolmates for being a loser. He hates himself and suffers from anxiety and depression. He surrounds himself with pink things to manage his anxiety. He finally hits rock bottom when he goes to masturbate and discovers he can no longer get an erection. The ED makes his sad life intolerable and he seeks treatment from FL urologist, who turns out to be his first love. \n\nLoved that this drama challenges the idea that having a good job/money/style are what makes a person worthy. In the context of how Korean culture is portrayed this seems like a very bold concept. The FL and SML do things that violate medical ethics in order to move the plot forward so this may be off putting for some but I was able to suspend disbelief because I was invested in the story and all the actors are good. ML in particular portrays the ML\u2019s depression with his whole body, and the scenes before he was depressed really highlight this. While the treatment for ML\u2019s mental illness isn\u2019t realistic, the depression and anxiety are very realistic. The story also realistically shows how difficult recovery is, and how it doesn\u2019t magically change a person\u2019s baseline personality. ML doesn\u2019t change from a timid beta into a bold alpha male; he\u2019s the same person just not depressed anymore. \n\n**One the Woman** is an action-revenge-prosecutor-chaebol-romance vehicle for Honey Lee. She\u2019s great in it as a rough mannered, foul mouthed, aggressive prosecutor with a hidden agenda. Yes, it\u2019s ridiculous that someone would have a doppelg\u00e4nger who even has the same hairstyle, but suspend disbelief and go along for the ride. The story is really all about the FL and her agenda of revenge and justice. There\u2019s a lot of comic relief when FL starts living as her doppelg\u00e4nger. The ML has his own story and although he can hold his own in a fight he\u2019s really the beta to her alpha. There\u2019s no stupid miscommunication-based breakup thankfully. If you liked the strong female leads in Love to Hate You and Military Prosecutor Doberman you should enjoy this drama.",

            "comment": "**Rainless love in a godless land**\r(Taiwanese drama) \n\r\nI loved that every element of the drama - Taiwanese indigenous culture, folk tales, FL's job in travel agency, environmental awareness, drama centering gods - is so smoothly connected to the main plot.\r\n\r\nI absolutely loved the ost and bgm. Taiwanese drama really knows how to pair music with scenes.\r\n\r\nThe cast is also perfect, apparently half of them are from **someday or one day**. Loved the random mini reunion &gt;!of sood couple at the beach!&lt;. \r\n\r\nI was very impressed by Alice (toem) and the &gt;!psychopath!&lt; doctor from sood who plays as a playful character (God of wisdom) here. The ML didn't quite convince me at the beginning as he lacked a godlike aura imo but impressed me &gt;!when I actually learned the truth about him because kakarayan was truly godlike!&lt;. I am happy with the cast and their acting, it felt natural.\r\n\r\nThe writer was either truly creative and pre-planned the entire plot or very clever to naturally cover up dead-ends in the plot with coherent twists. Whatever be it, she deserves a praise. While such storytelling didn't quite have the immersion effect on me (plot conveniences were too apparent), it was interesting enough to keep me engaged. \r\n\r\nI was mostly intrigued by the concept of kawas, the gods esp toem and falli, reflection of life and papa orip and &gt;!wished the writer had continued with them instead of including a 'Clean-up' twist in ep12!&lt;. While the twist made sense, it wasn't satisfying to me as it made &gt;!the entire journey pointless!&lt;\r\n\r\n&gt;!I appreciate her unconventional concept of God with a fragile heart full of feelings who can fall in love and be depressed like human, but I didn't enjoy the depiction of a terrible chess player in him who unnecessarily drags the game and then flips the board. I was still okay with all those dragging but didn't like how the subplot of papa orip was handled!&lt;.\r\n\r\n&gt;!It started with so much potential with falli and the environment awareness girl; I absolutely loved the short conversation with kakarayan at the beach about the nature, human nature and God's helplessness. Couldn't believe that the drama went downhill from there. While I somehow accepted that the writer made kakarayan gift tien ti literal super power, I was annoyed at how the writer so boldly swept the subplot of papa orip under the rug with orad-and-his-forceful-acceptance-of-illusion-as-reality as an excuse esp since she had the option to properly wrap up that subplot!&lt;. But of course her twist was poetic and storytelling made sense so I couldn't stay angry much longer. \r\n\r\nI loved how the romance was handled &gt;!in flashbacks. Surprisingly, I didn't feel that uncomfortable at the fated romance of the thousand years old orad and seven years old tien ti mainly because orad fell in love with her adult self and was only following kakarayan's order to protect her, not groom her. However, I found kakarayan's romance plot a little funny but it was also poetic esp how he wanted orad, who was created from his lovesick tears, to live the dream he wanted. While the ending was a happy one, it felt bittersweet to me as orad was heading to the same heartbreaking end like kakarayan, for he was still the immortal God of rain while tien ti was a mortal human. Perhaps he will deny his existence once tien ti dies of old age and bring doom to the world!&lt;\r\n\r\nA little disappointed because the drama had a lot of potential. It is still an interesting watch with original concept and refreshing execution, so highly recommend it. **(8/10)**\r\n\r\n**PS. Recommend me more Taiwanese dramas, I am loving them a lot!",

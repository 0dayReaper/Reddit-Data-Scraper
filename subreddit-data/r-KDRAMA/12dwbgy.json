            "comment": "I think this is the first romance I have seen where the main leads look so uncomfortable with each other. If the camera angle kiss last week wasn't enough, they gave us the most tepid hugs today. Their body language makes it so obvious that both the actors feel icky showing any kind of physical affection. Gongchan isn't getting any better, and SeoWon looks lost playing off his bad acting. \n\nThe second couple is so much better but they get just 2-3 minutes of screentime every episode. What's the point of even having them?\n\nJust finished the 7th episode and I'm in no mood to start the 8th. Regret not dropping this earlier.",

Hugs can honestly do more for me than kisses and I especially loved the drunken one. \n\nThen 8th just broke my heart. I loved the scene of them arguing in the bed, and really liked the acting there (Gongchan\u2019s snot made and appearance lol).\n\nI do wonder how the road to forgiveness will be, since broken trust is hard to repair.",

Unfortunately, he was framed as the notorious and mysterious swindler \"Big Mouse\" and sent to prison.\n\nThis series leans more on the entertainment aspect, with some surreal but intense scenes. A few plots holes but it's an enticing series and it remains a thriller.\n\n*Blind*\n\nIt's inspired by a true story. It's about three characters who become involved in a serial murder case with the jury members as the victims. These three individuals try to uncover the truth behind the deaths.\n\nThis series is a bit lackluster compared to others but you might like it, the story is really tragic for the victims and very mysterious. Lots of twists and turns.\n\n*Connect*\n\nThe series depicts the mysterious tell of a man who has been deprived of a part of his body by organ hunters and becomes 'connected' with a person who has received an organ transplant, which turns out to be a serial killer. \n\nThe production is more sci-fi thriller, and I would say it's a nice series overall.\n\n*Duel*\n\nThe series is about a hardened detective cop whose daughter is kidnapped. He begins a chase against great odds to solve the mystery and hunt down the suspect using the one clue he has : Two men with the same face were at the crime scene.\n\nIt's an intense thriller chase, with a great actor playing two characters. A slight touch of sci-fi.\n\n*Insider*\n\nTells the story of a judicial trainee named Kim Yo Han. After going undercover for an investigation, Kim Yo Han experiences a crisis and ends up struggling as he gambles his life in prison.\n\nIf the premise is similar to *Big Mouth* this series takes a different turn, very dark, full of action, gambling, gangs and such. Much more mature production.\n\n*Mouse*\n\nProbably my favorite thriller. A suspenseful story that asks the key question, \u201cWhat if we could identify psychopaths in advance ?\u201d.\n\nIf *Beyond Evil* is from the perspective of victims, here *Mouse* is from the perspective of serial killers and psychopaths (I suggest the 2 bonus episodes as well).\n\n*Stranger From Hell*\n\nThis is the story of a young guy in his 20s who moves from the countryside to Seoul. While looking for a place to live, he stumbles upon a cheap hostel that shares the kitchen and bathroom with other residents. However, mysterious events start occurring in the apartment, causing Jong Woo to begin fearing the apartment's residents.\n\nI must say that it's more of a psychological thriller where we witness a person falling into madness. Not a lot of mysteries, more intensity.\n\n*Taxi Driver*\n\nIt's about Kim Do Gi who was an officer in the Special Forces. When a serial killer murders his mother, he spends his days in agony. While feeling wronged and broken, Do Gi meets Jang Sung Chul, who recruits Do Gi to work for his company, Rainbow Taxi. Far from an ordinary taxi service, Rainbow Taxi is a secret organization that avenges victims whom the law didn't protect.\n\nThis series felt satisfying. Felt like it's the audience getting the revenge lmao. The action scenes are really well done.\n\n*King of Pigs*\n\nTW// this series is quite violent, especially depicting SA on teenagers, and all kinds of violence and torture.\n\nIt's about two friends meet up and recall their experiences as victims of school bullying when they receive a message from a friend from 20 years ago and mysterious serial killings begin to occur.\n\nThrough these characters with tragic fates, the drama touches on the origin of school violence and the bullying that pervades modern society. It's a very heavy series.\n\n*The Veil*\n\nIt's a story about a top National Intelligence Service (NIS) agent. In his endeavor to uncover the internal traitor that brought him to his downfall, he confronts a much bigger enemy behind the organization.\n\nThis series is full action thriller, only intensity and no boredom.\n\n*Through the Darkness*\n\nBack in the 1990s, the citizens of Seoul were gripped with a paralyzing fear after a series of brutal attacks and murders occurred. His habit of striking at random made it impossible for the detectives to predict his next move. They will try to use the successful American F.B.I. methods by criminal profilers to identify serial killers.\n\nThis is a series that is giving *Mindhunters* if you have seen the series, this series is more slow paced and really showcases the work it took for profilers to be accepted in the Korean police.\n\nI have more suggestions, honestly Korean thrillers are the best.",

So many great characters--I'll be real, Jang Geu Rae had me crying buckets of tears--but this guy, this guy \\[insert heart-shaped bokeh lights here\\] --&gt; Oh Sang Sik! It took me a bit to realize this was the same actor as harabeoji in Reborn Rich. \n\nIt took me back to my days working in an office. My working environment didn't have quite the same level of stress, but I still found Misaeng very relatable. The pressures we are subjected to in order to survive under capitalism are extreme. I really appreciated how Misaeng showed the ugliness of this struggle in an office environment, but also the humanity and beauty of so many of those who struggle. \ud654\ud305! to all workers, everywhere.",

So I started **Master\u2019s Sun** last night. I binge watched 6 eps in a row and am giving it a rest for now. I think I tried watching it when it was airing (in 2013!!) but i thought it might be too scary for me. It\u2019s really not hahaha it\u2019s more of a comedy horror. Also it is hilarious. \n\nWhat I like most is how giddy Gong Hyo Jin is with So Ji Sub\u2019s character. Their bickering is too adorable. Whenever she tries to touch So Ji Sub I just crack up at how cute she is. I totally get why everyone loves Hyo Jin, she acts so natural onscreen and has such great chemistry with her actors. I remember watching her in **Pasta**, and goddamn. She\u2019s so great at playing \u201cjust in love\u201d characters. \n\nEach episode has its own plot line as well and some of those made me cry. I can\u2019t wait for the main plot to thicken, but so far enjoying the ride. It doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously and is quite tropey, so it\u2019s good for anyone who wants some good fun. \n\nI do hate So Ji Sub\u2019s hairstyle in this though, but I suppose it will remain as an era that has passed. All is well.",

His only flaw is that freaking ugly haircut of his!  I actually don't like both of the FLs though I can understand their actions. The old man villain is seriously despicable. The OST \"Start Over\" is addictive and now a new addition on my playlist.\n\nI know a lot of people loves this drama and a lot hates this drama too.

Saeroyi\u2019s only flaw was his haircut and I didn\u2019t like either of the leads (I actually really disliked the girl he ended up with, and that\u2019s not something I usually stand for in kdrama but it was still good enough that I completed it. I love Park Seojoon)\n\nThe ost was fun too and I love listening to Sweet Night by V, it\u2019s so calming. \n\nThe evil man was awful but he was so captivating - that actor is amazing. I\u2019ve seen him in **Stranger** before, also evil I think. Very good. \n\nMy overall feeling of happiness and accomplishment at the end contributed to my high scoring of the drama. It had flaws, yes, but I loved watching the camaraderie and as usual, Park Seojoon served. I fell in love with him watching it so I was able to binge watch **What\u2019s wrong with secretary Kim** (which I couldn\u2019t watch before because it was too pompous- but after the rose colored glasses of being in love with him, I couldn\u2019t get enough of. AURA!)\n\nHave a great day!",

Lee Jun Ho is very good in his role as the really nice 'rough-tough' guy, and the actress opposite him is also very good (what large, shiny eyes she has! \ud83d\ude04 They really played them up with the camera). The 'bad guy' feels like a copy of the actor's *Ghost Doctor* role (for me, since I watched that first). \n\nOverall, I'm liking it/intrigued, and will keep watching.",

I\u2019m on episode 11 and wondering if it gets any better??? \n\nFor a woman with so many accomplishments I find it incredibly hard to believe she was that dumb. Yes, she was book smart, but from what I\u2019ve seen so far, she has no common sense. She\u2019s had such a harrowing young life to be so naive and gullible. Also putting herself in precarious situations.\n\nI\u2019m struggling to like ANY of the characters so far, with the exception of the ML. \n\nDoes she get any wiser or somewhat savvy as the story progresses?",

Seo In-guk has me sold on his role as Doom, as subtle moves such as the way he tilts his head observing a situation, when he chooses to smile a wry smile briefly, and delivery of lines. He owns this role and it is the first time I have seen this actor.  One of the middle episodes kind of fell apart for me, but I am convinced things will pick up again with pace and plot.",

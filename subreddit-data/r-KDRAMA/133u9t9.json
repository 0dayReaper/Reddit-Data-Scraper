But hopefully I'm wrong!\n\nI'm rooting for &gt;!Happiness and the HosPlay couples!&lt; to make it as far as possible, but even if they don't, it'll still be fun to see the results! \n\n(I love these brackets because they often end up serving as basically a census of what dramas have been watched the most on the sub/what genres are the most popular here. I also think a lot of people who rarely comment end up voting so you get a larger picture than just looking at which threads have the most comments/upvotes, but again who knows for sure.)",

Their interactions lacked depth and reasoning, making it difficult for me to invest in their storyline. And although the writers seemed to focus too much on their relationship, detracting from the overall plot, their relationship still made no sense. They started falling in love out of nowhere, which was so frustrating because we had seen one of the most genuine and meaningful relationships in a kdrama just a few episodes back. I could write paragraphs about how much I hate them, but overall, it's just that the writers created a new and cheap love story, while simultaneously cheapening the beautiful love story of the previous season.",

I feel like the writers should have held those kiss scenes until UK knew that the soul is still the same person.\nAs per their chemistry, I felt the same way. More kiss scene doesn\u2019t equal chemistry like a lot of people think. I recently saw that P1 is still in Netflix global for about 21 weeks now, I think a lot of people actually prefer the first part for the overall great storyline &amp; acting.",

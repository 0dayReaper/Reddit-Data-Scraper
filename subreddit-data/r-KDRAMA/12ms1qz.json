            "comment": "Going to sneak a brief review in here. Just finished **Bulgasal: Immortal Souls**. It had been on my \"continue watching\" list for a while but I'd never been in the mood to make it past the first episode. Glad I did, because once you realize what's going on, it's a fun ride with a great ending.\n\nB:IS is 16 episodes that aired in 2021 starring Kwon Nara, Lee Jin-wook, Gong Seung-yeon, and Lee Joon. The supporting cast is full of great actors like the silver fox, Jeong Jin-yeong (silver fox is a compliment in America; if it's not a compliment in Korea, amend it to however you compliment a good-looking older man), Kim Woo-seok, and Park Myung-shin.\n\nI had to look up \"bulgasal\" because I wanted to make sure that I wasn't stating something obvious because B:IS is essentially a really good vampire story. The sources I found said that while a bulgasal is a mythological monster in Korean folklore, it doesn't look anything like Lee Jin-wook, so I'm suggesting that viewing B:IS as a vampire story adds to the experience.\n\nLJW is Dan Hwal, a Bulgasal who 600 years ago, was human until Kwon Nara's Kim Hwa-yeon murders his blind son and his wife and steals his soul, making *him* the Bulgasal and her destined to be continually reborn but with his soul. Hwal has spent 600 years tracking her descendant down to get his revenge by jamming her in a deep well. Yes, the Bulgasals \\[Bulgasi? Bulgasalae?\\] drink blood, and of course the ones who drink human blood are stronger than the ones who hamstring themselves with morals and ethics and crap and just drink animal blood from the butcher.\n\nThis sets up essentially a loooong enemies-to-lovers (although not physically) saga, with the other characters being reborn and drawn into Hwal's bad karma, as well as a love triangle with Lee Joon's Ok Eul-tae.\n\nWhile the ensemble is full of the common tropes (plucky orphan \\[Wooshin\\], strong sister with psychic powers \\[Gong Seung-yeon\\], hard-drinking retired detective \\[Jeong Jin-yeong\\], mystic older woman \\[Park Myung-shin\\], etc.), they're so well-acted and executed that it's comforting to half-way guess most plot twists because they make sense rather than just being there for the sake of laziness.\n\nLee Joon's Ok Eul-tae is a gloriously chaotic villain but with so much empathy built up you really wish for everyone to have an HEA but they probably won't. I loved Lee Jin-wook in **Sweet Home** and he brings that same subtle touch to the stoic lead, Hwal. In Kwon Nara's hands, Hwa-yeon just *radiates* goodness. Like not the innocent naivete that passes for a \"good\" character, but just the kind of air of sanctification I associate with saints. She's just out there loving everybody and trying to make them all get along!\n\nNot going to add any spoilers just to say it was a great fantasy, with brutal and bloody fights, and well-earned tears. If you like things like **Island**, this is similar but more grounded, like **Island** if you took away the Priest's light saber and had a plot viewers could comprehend.\n\n**Tropes Spotted:**  So many. I really wanted to screen capture two scenes where Hwal carries Hwa-yeon:  in the first, he flings her over his shoulder like a sack of grain, and in the second, he gives a proper piggyback ride just like LJW must have learned in kdrama school. I wanted to put the screen captures side-by-side with a circle and a slash through the first one and a green checkmark on the second one.",

She is the author of a best-selling book about love and she is also famous as a dating coach. She has made lots of famous sayings as a dating coach and gained sympathy from the public. As Deborah, Yeon Bo Ra is honest, witty, and popular with women. As Yeon Bo Ra, things are different for her. She gets involved with Lee Soo Hyuk.\n&gt;\n&gt;Lee Soo Hyuk (Yoon Hyun Min) works as a publishing planner. He is an unpredictable man. He is sometimes gentle and passionate to women, but sometimes indifferent and cold. Love is a difficult thing for him. He doesn't like Deborah, who talks like she knows everything about love, but he unexpectedly gets involved with her and faces a change in his life.\n&gt;\n&gt;Han Sang Jin (Joo Sang Wook) is the CEO of Jinri Publishing Company. He is Lee Soo Hyuk\u2019s close friend and business partner.\n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cBora!

Some scenes are cut too long while others feel like they are abruptly cut short in a way that disrupts the flow.\n\nAnd...for some reason, the dialogue in this drama is feeling a bit cringey to me. Like if the dialogue was heard in a daily drama, I wouldn't bat an eye at it because it's what's expected. But when the dialogue here is paired up with the fancy production values, it makes me cringe instead of enjoying myself and indulging in the over-the-topness of it all.",

And I think what's worse is that the dialogue often feels very unnatural. Like Hae Soo repeatedly telling Tae Ra that she's her beloved unni -- it felt so unnatural and forced. I think the audience is intended to buy into their sisterly bond and worry about their relationship  now that Hae Soo feels betrayed but personally, I feel nothing about this arc right now because I don't buy into their sisterly bond in the first place.\n\nIn contrast, I feel the joking and ribbing between the three male leads to be more believable (though still a bit silly). \n\n&gt; grey haired head of the psych place\n\nShe's currently my least favorite thing about the drama. Her character just doesn't seem convincing as a villain, I don't find her at all threatening.",

            "comment": "*Ep 4*\n\nAnd I'm putting it on hold, none of the characters are really doing it for me.\n\n*Hae Soo* \n\nHer character came across as extremely stupid to me this episode given her reaction to finding out that Tae Ra is code 50. I can't believe that her reaction to finding out Tae Ra is code 50 is to go berserk on her and concentrate all her rage and revenge on Tae Ra instead of even considering for a second that there's someone else behind her. Like sure Tae Ra is older than her but clearly not by much -- they are obviously in the same 5-10 year age bracket. The assassination looked to be around her college years, if not earlier, which puts Tae Ra in a similar stage of life. If this ain't a flashing neon sign that 50/Tae Ra was a hired gun, I don't know what is.\n\nSo watching Hae Soo go bersek on Tae Ra feels pointless and unsatisfying. Having her use Tae Ra's daughter as a 'threat' feels even dumber. Even if Hae Soo does nothing more to Ji Woo, the fact that she even took Ji Woo in the first place and made Tae Ra freak out has already lost any points of sympathy for her situation in my book as Ji Woo is a completely innocent party.\n\nAnd her attempts at investigative reporting so far feel...not that smart or professional.\n\n*Pil Seung/Bodyguard/&gt;!105!&lt;*\n\nUgh, I was dreading this reveal last episode and kept hoping it wouldn't be the case but of course it's &gt;!the little brother who didn't die from the motorcycle accident/being run over!&lt;. I don't like this bodyguard setup mostly because it's very limiting to what the character can do (protect &amp; betray via telling someone else about her whereabouts/actions). If he leaves his post as bodyguard to do this and that, it'll feel too 'unprofessional'. If he's 'always' acting as the bodyguard, his interactions will be limited. Guess I just wanted him to be more of a wild card.\n\n*Grey haired villain*\n\nToo much of a caricature and considering how clueless she is about so many things, doesn't feel convincing as a villain. And I'm sorry, her line today about her pride being hurt because her right hand man had been beaten up twice by Tae Ra was hilarious.\n\nAnd finally, Tae Ra's unni running away from &gt;!the killer!&lt; without kicking her heels off in the pouring rain just felt unbelievably dumb. And like they weren't event heeled boots or something that would require hands to take off. She couldn't kick them off at different points in the chase to leave them behind as a clue or something? \n\nAnyways, I'm rolling my eyes too often and too hard while watching this to keep watching at this point.",

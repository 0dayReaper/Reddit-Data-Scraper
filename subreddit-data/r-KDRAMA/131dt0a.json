    "postText": "Which dramas have you given up on this month? (And why?)\n\nIn order to keep this thread from becoming a vortex of negative energy we  encourage our users to share their reasons and reviews as to why they dropped certain dramas. This way rather than just hating on dramas  without reason this thread can become a constructive place for us all.  This serves to both inform others who may be wary of certain aspects of dramas they wish to avoid and others who have watched the dramas in full  may be able to encourage users to pick up dramas again in the future if  the problems they had were only momentary aspects of the drama.\n\n**Please remember that every individual watching goes in with their own life experiences and biases so not everyone will see the drama in the same light or enjoy it in the same way.** \n\n***Just because someone did not enjoy a drama that you loved is not a slight against you as a person.***\n\nWhen participating in this discussion remember, whilst dramas do not have feelings, human beings do. **Be kind to one another.**\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

She didn't know or love the guy that much/that well, but she was trying really hard to have a 'good relationship' in theory, do all the 'right' things, etc. to the point where her whole ego and self-image and life was invested into it. She felt like her entire self worth shattered in that moment, and after her self-worth shattered we see how she deals with that (by increasingly messing up her life more and more, alienating people, and acting generally unable to accept reality). This is basically the grief cycle, we have finally reached acceptance. This is about grief re: her own ego and her 'old life,' and not about the man.  \n\n\nIn that regard I thought the breakup was incredibly well-done, but I also have seen friends go through breakups like this and display very similar behaviours and mental characteristics, so this really hit me as  being FAR more realistic than the way rough breakups are often depicted in dramas. Usually they just serve as a convenient little 'setup' plot point for a meet cute rather than a whole event that affects the characters in realistic ways.  \n\n\nRe: screen time, I think they got way more than she has with the ML so far!! But I think the 'mourning on her own' part is also deliberate - it is like a grieving process, he wants nothing to do with her and that's why she's taking it so hard.",

I didn't understand why they are building her up to be so flawed... i zoomed through the first 5 episodes and I found it incredibly annoying. Her response to the breakup could have taken 1 episode. 1.5 max if am being generous. But this was far too much. At one point I felt sorry for her ex boyfriend. He was right. It must have been stifling for him. I don't condone cheating but in this case, breaking up didn't even seem like an option if her response was going to be clinginess and constant meltdowns.\nSuch a disappointment. I haven't found anything I could really get into this month.",

Similarly they couldn't have made her hit rock bottom and done enough exposition on her pre-existing attitudes, flaws, etc. with one or 1.5 episodes and they needed that to set up the relationship between the leads too. I think the reason people keep complaining about this is that this drama is not meant to be a formulaic romcom, but is marketed a bit like one, so people who aren't into character-driven/growth driven shows keep expecting this to be something different than what it is.\n\nThat being said I did at points feel a bit sorry for the ex too, although breaking up is ALWAYS an option and the correct one over cheating. She wasn't THAT clingy and he kept pretending to want to work things out and going to her house first. I think you were supposed to feel sorry for him/understand that she was pretty suffocating in the relationship though, at least that seemed to be the intent of the writing.  \nShe is not always ditzy in all her dramas though no, although her voice tends to make her seem that way more than other actresses. She was quite 'badass' in that one time travel drama, Queen In-Hyun's Man, and in Goblin.",

I enjoyed the FL in True Beauty and the ML in Hospital Playlist, so my reasons to watch it were centered around these actors.\n\nFirst, the plot:\n\nIt became evident the trope of not feeling good enough for someone's love would be center stage. What disappointed me was the FL held a nonsensical grudge against the ML that simply did not warrant her reaction. Then she takes up with the 2nd ML and fights like hell to keep him in her life, only to viciously and unceremoniously cast him aside.\n\nThe trope of the ML being pursued by the 2nd FL was so exhausting. Starting the relationship as a second best scenario, she becomes hell bent on keeping him and continues to stall his inevitable dumping of her, to the point of blackmail using her father. Can't people in Korean society just break up and be done with it?\n\nPlease help me understand these two plot lines.\n\nSecond, the actors:\n\nThe FL was HORRIBLE! I had to walk away after Ep. 12.\n\nThere. I said it. She had ONE...ONE!!! Expression through the entire show. I can act better than this girl. Not only was she ridiculously stoic, she had no reason to be!!! WTF was her character analysis to play it that way???\n\nThe ML was really good. He made up for it.\n\nWhew.

People either hate watched it or was sucked right back in from the cliffhangers/shocking incidents at the end of each episode. Ive seen so many rants like yours in those threads and ive dished out my own rants after the end of almost every episode, but somehow we still get sucked right back in, as evident in the number of comments on the threads \ud83d\ude05. Honestly, it helped me appreciate the show a lot better pursing through the comments in the thread where there were signs or actions i missed in the episode that could have explained a lot of the frustrating things the characters in the show do and helped me understand the plot better. The immediate reaction after finishing the show was that i hated it a lot but after letting it stew for a few months now, I really appreciate how the show tackled the issue of societal class, timing in relationships and also the practical aspect of relationships not just the idealistic, romantic viewpoint. On the point of the acting, i actually had no problems with Moon Ga Young's acting as the facial expressions suited the character she was playing. Keum Sae Rok though really shined in this, especially those painful break up scenes.",

It was just so painful and unpleasant to watch the whole time, and I kept expecting something to get better but it seemed to only get worse. I am not sure what motivates writers/producers to make these stories which seem to only depict negativity, pain, stupid decisions etc. but it seems to be a relatively popular trope in Asian dramas in general.",

How convenient that the much needed assistant appears out of nowhere. This is just one of the many examples. HDY got attracted to MDG because of her play style in the GO game?

I would have respected the show 100x more if they used a ladder to climb over the gates or something. The body was such a crucial piece of evidence but hey, lets just leave it accessible because why not. \n\nI would even make an argument that no other main character in a revenge k-drama had as easy of a revenge than MDG.",

Initially I really liked the Sungyunkwan Scandal Vibes of the determined heroine and her three knights (the scholar, the soldier the rake) and I found the mystery of everyone's true identity reasonably engaging. But once that was all revealed and it started being more about palace intrigue with old beardy guys I lost all interest. Also, Ryeoun has one facial expression and I was shocked to discover he's not an idol actor.",

So now dramas have to really catch me for me to watch as my tv time is limited. \n\nFor this month I've dropped; \n\nBo ra Deborah! Ep 1 - it felt so boring. The most interesting thing was Park So jin new hair do. I love it. Every time she came on screen it was all I could see. Sadly though it was not enough to keep me. \n\nPandora beneath the paradise Ep 3 - i started watching for Lee Sang yoon and reached that far because of him. But unfortunately he wasn't enough to keep me. Trying to understand what's happening is too much work. \n\nSecret Romantic Guesthouse Ep 2 - Firstly the cinematography is terrible. I'm really surprised that it doesn't have better quality. Next the acting and interactions between cast is poor. This really isn't the best work and feels like hurried homework just to pass. \n\nI'm hoping the new upcoming dramas would have some gems among them.",

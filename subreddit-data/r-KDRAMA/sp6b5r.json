CLOY really wouldn\u2019t be what it is without the two of them\u2026 there\u2019s something so sincere about their performance and that clearly comes, in part, from the connection they share irl. i remember watching a couple of interviews way back and thinking how drawn to one another they seemed, to each other\u2019s opinions, stories and gazes (who wouldn\u2019t ship them together! ahaha) i\u2019ve just read their instagram posts and they\u2019re so lovely, and filled with so much love. i hope they have a beautiful, private wedding and spend many more happy moments together. always grateful to them for giving us CLOY, for so many reasons.",

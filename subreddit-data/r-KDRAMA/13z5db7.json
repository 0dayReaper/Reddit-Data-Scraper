    "postText": "Welcome to our series of posts highlighting information and resources available within our subreddit. In this post, we introduce our [FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and our [KDRAMA 101](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources), which contains some of the most commonly asked questions and other basic information about kdramas. This post will focus on a selection of questions about kdrama production and broadcast process, check out our FAQ for even more information.\n\nIf you have any additional questions about the information in this post or our FAQ, feel free to leave a comment with your question/feedback.\n\n**Why Do Kdramas Have Different English Titles?**\n\nEnglish titles of dramas can be one of the following types:\n\n&gt;* **Official English Title:** an official English title determined by the production company/broadcast station\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Literal Translation:** a literal translation of the official Korean title (most often the official English title) \n&gt;\n&gt;* **Alternate Translation:** an alternate translation of the official Korean title\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Alternate Title Translation:** a translation of an alternate Korean title (sometimes the initial working title)\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Alternate Title Specific to Stream Source:** certain streaming sites have alternate titles for dramas\n\nWe advise checking the drama title on a resource such as [MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/) for alternate titles. \n\n**How Many Episodes And How Long Is Each Episode?**\n\nMost kdramas are between 12 to 52 episodes long with each episode being around 1 hour long. **Notable exception:** tvN shows have a tendency for 1hr+ episodes, especially for the newer shows. (Background: This trend was started with Reply 1997 which started with breezy ~35 min long episodes but as the drama snowballed in popularity, its episode lengths kept expanding until its final episodes were 1hr+.)\n\n**What's With The 16 vs 32 Episodes?**\n\nDue to laws regarding advertising, some broadcasters have split up their drama episodes into two halves so every two ~30-minute episode would comprise the traditional 1-hour long episode. Thus what would be the typical 16 episodes are now 32 episodes.\n\n**What Types Of Kdramas Are There?**\n\nKorean dramas can be categorized into 4 categories based on their form/length:\n\n&gt;* **Daily Dramas** (30 min episodes, usually 100+ episodes in length)\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Miniseries** (mid-length dramas, 12-20 hours long)\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Serial/Family/Weekend Dramas** (long-form dramas)\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Web Dramas**\n\n[*See More Details*](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_what_are_korean_dramas.3F)\n\n**What's The Difference Between Pre-Produced and Live-Production?**\n\nKdramas are generally produced by production companies in conjunction with the production arm of the broadcasting station. Kdramas are generally live-produced, meaning that the drama is being filmed as it is airing.\n\n&gt;**Pre-Produced:** Where the drama has completely finished filming and all after production work prior to its airing. Most kdramas broadcast on the broadcasting channels (free to air and cable channels) are ***not*** pre-produced though there are exceptions. In contrast, most kdramas produced for the streaming platforms (Wavve, TVING, Netflix) are pre-produced.\n&gt;\n&gt;**Live-Production:** Most kdramas are filmed as they are broadcast. While all kdramas began filming before its premiere date, most dramas are still filming during its broadcast run, with some dramas still filming in the hours before its finale broadcast. This means that screenwriters may be writing or adjusting the script depending on viewer feedback. \n\n**Do Kdramas Have Teams of Screenwriters?**\n\nGenerally only the head screenwriter(s) is credited for a drama but most screenwriters have assistants. Kdramas do not have screenwriter teams common to western/American shows because kdramas are generally not multi-season continuations that go on for years and years.\n\n**What Are Korea's Major Broadcast Channels?**\n\n&gt;**Free-to-air**: KBS (public broadcaster), SBS, MBC\n&gt;\n&gt;**Cable**: tvN, OCN, JTBC, TV Chosun, MBN, Channel A\n\n[*See More Details*](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_korean_broadcast_stations)\n\n**What Is A Typical Drama Promotional Cycle?**\n\nA drama's promotional cycle typically starts with the announcement of the project, which is often accompanied by initial casting news. Next, the initial script reading takes place and pictures are often released from this event to drum up interest in the drama. Once the filming begins, pictures taken during filming and coffee truck pictures are often shared. Usually shortly following the start of filming, official promotional material is releases, which includes drama poster(s), character posters, and teasers.\n\nBefore broadcast starts, there is generally an official press conference where the director (PD), the main cast members, and sometimes the writer will meet with the press to talk about the drama.\n\nBefore premiere or during broadcast (and sometimes after broadcast has finished), the cast members (together or individually) may appear on various variety shows to promote the drama.\n\n[*See More Details*](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_promotional_cycle_of_a_kdrama)\n\n**What Is PPL? (Product Placement)**\n\nPPL stands for \"Product Placement\", which is a form of embedded advertising -- an advertising technique used by companies to subtly promote their products through a non-traditional advertising technique, usually through appearances in film, television, or other media. In short, everything worn, eaten, or used in dramas may be advertising something. Oftentimes, the dialogue will make it clear that something is PPL and is being advertised by lauding the advantages of the PPL product. \n\n&gt; Why Do All Characters Have Same Car/Phone/Vacuum/Clothes? **PPL**\n&gt;\n&gt; Why Do They All Eat At Subway/Quiznos/BBQ Chicken/That One Coffee Shop? **PPL**\n&gt;\n&gt; Is PPL Possible In Historical Kdramas AKA Sageuks? Yes, it's possible. See [this post](/r/KDRAMA/comments/ho8z5i/a_question_about_product_placement_in_historical/) for insight and examples.\n\n**What Are OSTs?**\n\nOST stands for **Original Soundtrack**. All kdramas have their own original soundtracks (OSTs) -- songs specifically created for the kdrama. How many songs there are depends on the kind of drama it is. Generally, most dramas will have one or two theme songs that get used frequently. OST tracks are generally released as the drama broadcasts, they are **not** released all at once upon the premiere of a drama. Check our [Drama Resources](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/dramaresources) for where to find more information on OST releases.\n\nSome dramas also use previously existing songs -- these generally are not included in the OST, though new original covers of old songs specifically made for the kdrama generally are included as part of the OST.\n\nSometimes the background music of the kdrama available on a legal streaming site will differ from the version broadcast on Korean television due to copyright and licensing issues. [Here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101/netflix_faqs#wiki_what.27s_with_the_music.3F) is a slightly more in depth explanation of why music is changed.\n\n**Why Are Things Blurred?**\n\nOftentimes there will be things blurred in a kdrama. Blurring usually happens due to broadcasting regulations either due to copyright issues or the manner of the content being shown. \n\nIf no one is being harmed or killed, the blurring is likely due to copyright issues -- whatever is being shown does not have the right licenses to be shown/streamed everywhere so they are blurred out. This is done by post-production. Another form of blurring you may see is that brands and logos are blacked out by tape or otherwise covered within dramas so that they are not shown. These are generally done during filming and not via post-production.\n\nIf someone is being harmed or killed: broadcasting rules require blurring of weapons and other tools being used in a manner intended to hurt someone. This means that while a kitchen knife used for chopping vegetable is not blurred, if later that same knife is used for stabbing someone, it will be blurred. Note that these broadcasting rules apply only to kdramas broadcast on the broadcasting stations (free to air or cable ones). This means that movies will not be blurred. Additionally, kdramas available exclusively on streaming services (Wavve, TVING, Netflix, Viki, etc.) are also **not** subject to these regulations and do not have to be blurred.  \n\n**Where Is This Filming Location?**\n\nTo find information about a filming location, try [Korean Dramaland](https://koreandramaland.com/). You can search by a specific drama (to see the locations used in that drama) or by a location (to see all the dramas that have filmed there). They also include overseas locations. They are a still growing site and constantly adding new locations, you can contribute to it too to help it grow!\n\n**Is That A Cameo Or Something More?**\n\nThe concept of cameos is very well established in kdrama-land. Actors will often make special appearances (cameos) for directors, writers, and actors they've worked with in the past in their newest works. Friends within the industry will often do this too.\n\nWhen the story fits, they may cameo as a previous character. Other times, they will cameo as a completely new character, it really just depends on the situation. There's no need to force two stories together/make up theories, just treat them as ***cameos***.\n\n**Is There A Season 2?**\n\nIn general Korean dramas are not multi-season, so do not expect a second season unless:\n\n* It was announced at the start that the drama was envisioned as multiple seasons (think Netflix productions like Kingdom, Arthdal Chronicles, etc.)\n\n***or***\n\n* It was a very popular procedural (crime, forensics, legal). For example: Voice, Partners For Justice, Vampire Prosecutor, God\u2019s Quiz, etc..\n\nPosts asking about subsequent seasons of aired dramas are prohibited. All speculations about subsequent seasons of aired dramas should be made in one of our [FFA threads](/r/KDRAMA/?f=flair_name%3A%22FFA%20Thread%22).\n\n**Where Is The Sex?/Why So Chaste?**\n\nDifferent culture and broadcasting regulations. ***But also:***\n\nEver notice a scene where the leads are either in bed or heading towards the bedroom or hugging and then the scene cuts to black or cuts off and all of a sudden the next scene seems to have been sometime after or in the morning?\n\nThat's the kdrama way of ***hinting*** that the viewer should be using their imagination right then.\n\nAlso, anytime you hear a joke or talk about how strong a male lead's back and/or waist is, the *implication* is how good he will be in bed.\n\nThere are a lot of hints in most dramas that involve a relationship, it's just that kdramas are family friendly so they are not visually explicit. You can watch the same drama as your grandparents and your younger siblings but only those in the know will *nod* and *snicker* at the right times.\n\nSo if you see something that you think implies a couple having sex, you are probably picking up the right cues. The visually explicit stuff is saved for their movies.",

Korean public television is family friendly, because you might be watching this with your grandparents and your baby cousin in the second grade. That\u2019s why there\u2019s no visually explicit material (but plenty of innuendos if you can catch them). Cable television gets a little more on the explicit side but are still bound by broadcasting standards and restrictions. If you want lots of visually explicit material, explore Korean movies.",

                    "comment": "Live production still exists, it's just no longer *live* live like in the days of yore where they are shooting things the day of broadcast.\n\nThese days, it seems all OTT/web dramas are pre-produced. For broadcast station dramas though, a decent chunk are still live productions in the sense that they still haven't finished filming the entire drama completely when broadcast starts. There however is much smaller overlap in filming/broadcast schedule. I haven't done any consistent tracking of the issue but  as a general observation, I think most dramas that are live produced these days wrap up filming around 2 weeks or more before final week of broadcast.",

Perhaps a very small amount of them totally drop all that effort and move towards that characters behavior, but I find it extremely extremely unrealistic, for someone to portray it to that degree.  \n  \nThe ones who act like that are just the ones you can see, making you think they are all like that, when really they make up a small amount of gay or bi Koreans.  \n  \nMost gay people are just normal people with attraction to the same sex. Any behavioral differences are fueled by the culture around them and their lack of accepting social groups outside of the extremes, not their sexuality.  \n  \nIf we argued for better representation, it would do wonders for LGBT youth in Korea who face extreme anxiety about this. I know because I faced the same anxiety growing up in a conservative household myself and seeing unrelentingly flamboyant representations and not much else as a kid. I didn\u2019t relate to those gay characters, I felt alone, and I felt like the moment I came out, people would expect the same behavior from me. And although things got better in my country, it was true!  \n  \nThe truth is that these representations are hurtful to gay people and perpetuate the stereotypes that we fear the most from ourselves, and cause the opposite effect from a minority of us who feel like they have no choice but to embrace it and go all out.  \n  \nWe learned how many hidden gay men and women there are in Korea from the recent outbreak at Itaewon gay bars, no? There was confusion and anxiety about getting tested for the disease of the pandemic because their identity could be revealed and out them...   \n  \nThis is the struggle of a gay person in a conservative country, and Korea is no exception. I really hope you take a minute to try to understand my perspective even if you don\u2019t agree. Would you be okay if one day people expected that character out of you? Would you feel comfortable and respected?\nThis is what gay people fear most, out of their coworkers, family, friends, and even strangers in the street or supermarket. Truly, please consider this",

I don't actually live there so I'm totally removed from it but what I see in the news is slightly encouraging. It's a catholic country with a rather strong family oriented culture and traditions. The views of older generations are much narrower and judgemental still. It's the young ones, 20ties and such, who have travelled abroad, saw see gay people in foreign media and what gay pride actually means. They fuel the discussions . They organise parades.\nSeen in the scope of that, Love With Flaws was a good watch. It was respectful and unjudgemental like I've never seen before. It made me glad.",

Maybe because I\u2019m on my phone?) but with the reading, I think I understand better how the character can be seen as a caricature of gay people.\n\nFor me personally, I just saw him as similar to any other female or male character who is jealous of the MC. In this case, the character is also petty. And many of those jealous-type characters are quite petty. But I didn\u2019t find him obnoxious. I found him similar to some of the roles that are played by Hwang Bo-Ra. Such as, Hyena, or What\u2019s Wrong with Secretary Kim. (Interestingly enough, I found those characters to be obnoxious!)  I didn\u2019t, however, associate his personality traits with his sexuality.\n\nBut I think I understand better why it can be seen as problematic, since there is not much gay representation in general. So it would be good for whatever representation there is to be a less of a petty character, and probably not a comedic character at all.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t actually enjoy this drama much! I didn\u2019t even finish it. Maybe got half-way through? That probably doesn\u2019t make a difference in this conversation.

You may not associate his personality traits with his sexuality. You may not even do it unconsciously - but many other people, especially in regions of the world with low LGBT visibility such as South Korea, would and *will* and *have already* associated those negative traits with his sexuality - possibly because they have not known a gay person directly, or fear those who are different from themselves - so they may be starting with a mostly blank slate waiting for any information to associate, or be starting with a negative slate that tends to easily accept more negative information!  \n  \nBias and prejudice is a result of our ability to process information quickly. That includes heuristics, which are mental shortcuts that cause something to be perceived as wrong or dangerous, as well as good or beneficial. We evolved this so that we can make quick decisions for survival - a heuristic might tell you to back away from a dangerous and frightening wild animal, for example.  \n  \nObviously, these heuristics are useless in certain contexts, and people will inevitably associate those negative traits ***even if you do not***...  \n  \nSo I hope you can appreciate that, although you aren't aware of any negative associations you may have assigned LGBT people, that everyone - including LGBT people themselves - will unconsciously develop these heuristics in some way to some degree.  \n  \nI sincerely thank you for taking a look at the links I attached, I will see if there is some reason the images didn't show.",

At least for 90 mins. In that way we'd have a proper &gt;!courtroom drama!&lt; in the last ep that could've answered all the questions instead of that rushed scene and now that I think about it, it was also badly done. It would've made the show a 10/10 show with minimal plot holes. With a longer finale we could've had Ye-jin and So-jin &gt;!know who's their dad on screen and have them call Young-soon their grandma!&lt;. We could've had her &gt;!death and funeral!&lt; after that too. The show's heart was the familial bonding so it would've been so good to see them as one family at least for a scene or two. Even after &gt;!Young-soon's death we should've had at least one solid scene of Kang-ho and Mi-joo being the twins' parents.!&lt; The series was already crisp with 14 eps. I really wouldn't have minded a longer finale",

I liked the little details of Mi-joo\u2019s mum wearing her fur coat &amp; Sam-sik\u2019s mum carrying her white handbag - gifts from Kang-ho to Young-soon to them.!&lt;\n\nAs for the &gt;!reveal to the twins!&lt;, it maybe would\u2019ve been a nice-to-have but ultimately &gt;!the drama isn\u2019t about fathers!&lt;.  I love the &gt;!final proposal scene being a mirror to how Kang-ho\u2019s dad proposed in ep 1 so that was definitely more important between Mi-joo &amp; Kang-ho to fulfil his original wish to live a very long time with her.!&lt;\n\nIncidentally, in their final BTS, there\u2019s a very cute moment of Seo-jin &gt;!cuddling &amp; calling Kang-ho \u201cappa\u201d but when Kang-ho called!&lt; Ye-jin &gt;!\u201cdaughter\u201d, her response was \u201cyou\u2019re not my appa, Sam-sik is\u201d!!!&lt; That natural unscripted interaction is all I\u2019ll ever need \ud83d\ude02",

I never finished it (quit at 13), even though I'd loved the first few episodes, because towards the end the show started spoiling key events waaay before the main characters found out, and it made them look so dumb for not figuring out faster what was going on. I absolutely hated having to wait for them to catch up to what viewers already knew. Sucked the tension clean out of the show for me. I'm still so salty and disappointed in the writing choices. \n\nI also found myself being annoyed often with the wife for acting with little to no info or evidence.",

Newer shows that are super hyped up just make me anxious. I think its because I'm afraid I'll be disappointed in the end. I mean it took me two nights to finish the first episode and I haven't returned. \n\nThe same feeling came over me while waiting for **Little Women**,**The Glory**,**Our Blues** and **My Liberation Notes**.\n\nI've still only watched one episode of **Our Blues** but I'm halfway through with **The Glory**. Finished and raved about LW and MLN. **Bloodhounds** is great too btw.\n\nStarted **Designated Survivor:60 Days**. Why? It's dramatic,political and I like watching Son Sukku squint and make cocky faces at everybody. Have you noticed most actors have their go-to expressions regardless of the character they're playing?\n\nI have failed my diet and the ability to hold onto my shame. Anyway new week,new me.

It is about the female lead who used to worked for a big company, decided to take revenge by being the campaign manager of a Seoul mayoral candidate against the proxy candidate by her former employer.",

It's the easiest quickest way if you don't know the names \nof all of  the songs in the soundtrack. \n\nThen type the song by name or artist into Spotify and add it to my playlist.",

It has that balance of light and dark, but an ultimately hopeful and uplifting message.\n\nFor chill and low stakes, I think When the Weather is Fine is a good choice, though I'm only on episode 5. Our Beloved Summer and Hometown Cha Cha Cha are also good choices, but I wouldn't recommend binging those.",

It'll take something to top this.\n\nAs fate would have had it, binged the first 13 episodes &gt; a month ago, and only caught the last 3 over the weekend, to wait for my GF to return back from an overseas trip because she wanted to watch it together.\n\nEnding - &gt;!Pretty much turned out the way I expected it to. The 13th episode felt like the perfect happy ending, but because you just knew there were 3 more, the only option left was heartbreak.!&lt;\n\nI hated how it ended (execution notwithstanding...). But I couldn't find fault in it.\n\nMaybe being on the cusp of turning 30 gives me a different perspective from the majority demographic on this sub.\n\n&gt;!Their relationship was amazing but destined to fail. The x-factor 'support' which NHD gave BIJ was only special in their youth, where the problems of their world remained relatively insignificant. By the NHD was 21 and BIJ was 25, it had been superseded by responsibilities, decisions and consequences which every individual has to bear by him/herself. Both NHD and BIJ had become markedly different people from when they first met the 3-4 years before.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I also agreed with the decision of the writers for NHD and BIJ not to be in each other's lives (back as soulmates) after ending their romantic relationship. It would never have been enough for either of them. Again, like NHD said, it's all or nothing. And once they got a taste of 'owning' each other, nothing else could replicate that feeling and thus be good enough. !&lt;\n\nAn applause for all 5 main characters and the actors/actresses who portrayed them. Probably the first drama where I cared for 5 characters at such depth. Most dramas it's reserved for the ML and FL, and then slightly less for the secondaries. Their friendship was something else.",

Truly an ode to youth that resonates with everyone who's been through that phase in life.\n\nI agree with what you wrote in the first paragraph, maybe not so much with the second.\n\nTo me NHD and BIJ are still very much in love at the time of their parting. Problem being that:\n\n1. they each had distinct 'love languages' (for lack of a better word) which difference worked magically with physical proximity but was a disaster with LDR.\n2. BIJ had one priority which superseded friendship/romance - needing to make something of himself in his career to reunite his family; this only grew as he aged.\n3. Similarly whereas NHD was an aspiring high school fencer rooted in Korea, she had become Korea's star fencer and the team leader participating in competitions worldwide.\n4. Force majeure, I mean a 911-scale trauma inducing event probably tears apart any relationship",

Sometimes he is the one who sees that they must cook more or he is the one to repair something that breaks down. Chicken day is not just to humour him, everybody gets to choose a film taking turns. They remove some of the instances where he has to be helped, particularly the instance!&lt; where he sweeps the leaves the wrong way.\n\nAs it is, every scene with him is him &gt;!not understanding and receiving help, except for one scene in the beginning, when he was not listened to.!&lt;\n\nThe &gt;!waffle addiction!&lt; is very realistic. Full of &gt;!opioid peptides from all three gluten milk and eggs, and with the sugar to open the membrane and push it into the brain.!&lt;\n\nI also couldn't really buy the main romance, because once again we have the scenery where being kind and honest is so rare in a woman that it is enough to fall in love. All their conversation was about daily life, except for the PPL of that stupid game, and when they played footvolley.\n\nYou would think that they would do more sports like that. I saw a variety with the actual handball team of Korea, and they were very competitive and played Go in a very competitive way.\n\nThat they were competitive was mentioned in the drama, and they could have done it more, lots of small competitions also with ML.\n\nI am probably a weirdo, but all my friends talk about politics with their husbands. There has to be something that people have in common apart from daily life. This was not really shown.\n\nAs for the ending of the extreme shitty mother, I find it the more realistic ending of the characters. She already knew the director well and knew how to pressure him to get what she wanted. &gt;!A job.!&lt; \n\nSymbolism: *The system continues even if a few people managed to get out.*",

I haven't finished the drama yet but I think only 20% of the drama is focused on the romance, which for supposed romance drama isn't quite enough. I still like it but I wish it had a better, more fleshed out romance. I think as an audience we are supposed to believe in their romance because he likes being integrated into the daily family life after being so lonely and isolated. And she finally has someone who supports and takes care of her. I think this helps explain why they get together but it would have helped to see more of them sharing interests as a couple after they get together. It's all just cutesy stuff and a &gt;!weird fight over his murderous assistant!&lt; which feels like a weakness in the writing to me. As you mention, they are both so competitive, they could have had more of that in common. Perhaps watching or playing sports, as you mention, though he doesn't appear to be very athletic. Don't know how everyone feels about politics, but I can attest I also discuss politics and current events with my spouse. There is only so many times you can discuss the garbage schedule or what you are having for dinner! You need another topic of conversation. \n\nAlso, if waffle addiction is real, then I'm hoping that no one ever stages an intervention for me to send me to rehab.  But I just generally have a baked good addiction (muffins, cookies, croissants, etc.), so I'm sure I'm beyond help. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I can imagine the doctors saying \"there's nothing more we can do for her.\"",

                            "comment": "&gt; supposed romance drama\n\nThe title in Korean doesn't contain the word \"romance\". I think the title gives people the wrong expectations. Since I saw it after you guys, I knew what was coming. Anyway, it could have been better fleshed out without taking up much more time. But the writers are so set on that \"only kind woman around and nothing more is necessary, if we create too much of a personality with weird opinions or something people can't connect to\" \u2013 that is just my conjecture. \n\nI agree. They could have dropped those scenes where they put food into their mouth or praise the food, and instead do something more specific of *them*. This is a complaint I have of many Kdramas. \n\n&gt; though he doesn't appear to be very athletic. \n\nHe doesn't seem to be athletic, but he does seem to be competitive, working so hard to be the best teacher. So they could compete about all kind of silly stuff in daily life, I am not competitive so I can't think of anything now, but if you have seen Master in the House, variety show, they compete all the time. I think they did \"who can hold their face down in the snow for the longest time?\" \"Who can throw something and hit that thing on the other side of the road\". Whatever really. \n\n&gt; You need another topic of conversation.\n\nWith your special other you are even supposed to have *more* in common than with anyone else, so you are supposed to have *many* different topics to talk about. At least in our modern world and with our expectations. Perhaps people expect too much. \n\n&gt; \"there's nothing more we can do for her.\"\n\nOh dear LOL Not everybody have a direct negative reaction, though. At least today it is super easy to get clean food without gluten and milk, and my life is so much easier.",

The FL is wearing a shirt that says \"avoir la p\u00eache\" which according to my Google translating (any French speakers please correct me if I'm wrong) is an idiomatic phrase meaning something along the lines of being in good spirits or having high energy. It's a strange shirt for her to wear if that is truly the meaning because her &gt;!daughter has gone missing. Don't think she would be in very high spirits!!&lt;",

Why couldn't she have empowered herself without any males but anyway that's too much of a step forward in kdrama world.\n\nThe three male leads were great: RoWoon was pleasantly surprising actor and so beautiful. I just didn't buy into his character. Lee Do Hwa actor was a breakout star for me as second/ third ML. \n\nOf course, the main reason I kept watching: Lee Jae Wook, a fascinating actor and I'll never tire of his micro expressions, nor his rich voice. He did great and I feel his character deserved more.\n\nIn sum, this kdrama has slightly healing feels but missed the mark a bit for me, because it dragged in the last five episodes.\n\n\nSpoiler:\n\n\n\nLastly after Nevertheless I hate butterfly symbolism!",

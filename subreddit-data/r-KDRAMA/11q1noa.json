If the king is a good guy, the State Councillors kind of have to be bad guys, and vice versa; it's simply the only plausible conflict at that level. (This trope is sometimes referred to as [Evil Chancellor](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor).) As to why the *Left* State Councillor is so often the main villain, I don't know. Wikipedia says he was the second-ranked of the three. I assume there's some cultural or historical context familiar to Koreans. I don't recall a Chief State Councillor ever being mentioned in a sageuk!",

I agree that Lim Jiyeon nailed her role, but throughout Part 1 and 2 Yum Hye-Ran (Mrs. Kang) stood out the most for me. Fantastic performance by the actress \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc Honorable mention: Dong-Eun\u2019s \u201cmother\u201d; I hated her guts. Even more than Park Yeon-Jin. The revenge/punishment &gt;! chosen for her mom was so satisfying though. Or do you feel like it shouldve been more harsh..? !&lt; \n\nAnyone else kind of disappointed that there werent &gt;! more on screen interactions between Ha Do-Young and Dong-Eun? I mean Im glad there wasnt really any infidelity going on and he technically didnt side with Park Yeon-Jin, but I guess I was somewhat surprised by his tame yet safe choices (albeit they aligned with his character/persona) Loved that he put Ye-Sol first before everything !&lt;\n\nHappy to say that Lee Do-Hyun\u2019s character slowly grew on me in Pt 2 because I wasnt feeling any chemistry between the FL and ML in Pt 1). &gt;! Will there be a S2 focusing on his story/revenge\u2026? !&lt;",

            "comment": "Like many others, I also binged The Glory: Part 2 over the weekend. I personally thought pt 2 wasn\u2019t quite as exciting as pt 1, but the karma/pay back and endings for all the characters were so gratifying. Truly shows that &gt;! It be your own people sometimes lol. Dong-Eun didnt even need to get blood/dirt on her own hands. She just planted the seed and they all turned on one another. The only part I was kind of iffy about was her mother turning on PYJ as well although she had turned a blind eye to all the evil and misdeeds her daughter had committed throughout the years. I guess it\u2019s truly everyone for themselves !&lt; I felt like this drama took a new (&amp; refreshing?) turn on your typical mystery/revenge plots. I was initially surprised that the protagonists (seemingly) laid out all their cards on the table and revealed their identities too soon, but this writing and approach was still effective (imo) and able to keep the suspense/anticipation going too. Not sure how to feel about a potential Season 2 atm\u2026\n\nI also finished Mr. Queen this past week because Netflix kept recommending it to me. Am I the only one that starts a drama with a friend/sibling/partner only to watch ahead (oops) and later secretly rewind every episode just to rewatch it again with them? No? Just me? Haha my confession of the week \ud83e\udd2b: I already finished the whole drama, but technically we\u2019re still on episode 6 together \ud83e\udd72 oh well. At least on my usual \u201csecond watch\u201d I can pay attention to details Ive missed the first time around lol. \nAs fun as it was to watch the romcom, I couldnt shake off the weird feeling I got from the concept of the \u201cgender-swap\u201d plot\u2026I mean it was interesting and a fun twist to your typical time-travel/soul swapping story, &gt;! but the ending gets confusing/convoluted &amp; murky when Jang Bong Hwan and Kim So Yong\u2019s identities and souls start intertwining. Like does JBH have feelings for the King\u2026? Does the King like the Queen bc of JBH\u2019s personality or KSY\u2019s past\u2026The whole pregnancy thing was wild too lol. Spoiler (within a spoiler warning lol!): Im glad they spared Court Lady Choi and Hong Yeon\u2014 they were my fave, but they did her cousin dirty. Had him killed by his adoptive father and he was kneeling the whole time\u2026also the actor\u2019s expression was just \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41\ufe0fthroughout the whole drama lol !&lt; Anyhoo, I didnt think Kim Jung-hyun could pull off the image of a King, but there\u2019s a certain charm about him. Going to look for another Sageuk/historical drama to watch now~",

It's a combo of drama and comedy, and I really like it so far. \n\nI like fantasy dramas and fictional dramas with fantasy elements, so Midnight Museum is up my alley, so to say. Still, there are not many released episodes, so I don't have a set opinion on it yet. \n\nI also agree with u/KDramaTipsy \\- F4 Thailand is a great start for Thai dramas!",

All 8 episodes of S1 flew by. \n\nAt one point I even thought hey this is building up to be an episode end.... but the episode just started like 10 mins ago?? And then I looked and no it had been 40+ minutes.\nThis has never ever happened before for me. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc Season 2 is as good!",

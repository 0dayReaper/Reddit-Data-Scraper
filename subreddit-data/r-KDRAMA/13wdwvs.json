It was a masterclass of backstory exposition, which filled in the gaps in our understanding of the first time those scenes were shown to us.

Thanks to Ahn Eun-jin\u2019s stunning performance and the natural chemistry between the leads, it was swoonworthy in the best possible way.",

It would've been a great drama if it weren't for the 2ML never learning his lesson. It's like he keeps forgetting everything he's learned about the ML every other episode. So frustrating. I still liked Jinyoung in this role, though. He did well with what he had, and it's not his fault his character is this way. The acting in this drama, in general is wonderful. Also, the OST????? One of the best. 7.5/10. I would recommend it. Just bear with the 2ML.\n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n* **The Good Bad Mother (10/14)** \u2014 I love this drama so much. Some great moments that solidified how much I love the ML. Superb acting, superb romance, and it has one of my favorite plotlines - family and second chances. If this doesn't trip and fall right at the end, I see it having a rating of 9 or higher.\n* **A Business Proposal (5/12)** \u2014 I didn't expect to love this drama so much. It's so funny! I thought I'd love ML the most in this drama, but it's the FL who I'm so entertained by. Kim Se Jeong is soo funny. The way she emotes and moves her body is so dynamic and it's hard to look away. Her interactions with the ML are top notch comedy. Other than that, I enjoy watching the second couple on screen. They're a cuter presence on screen. So far, it's a 10/10 for me. I know the ending isn't favored by people, so I'm hesitantly giving it a 10.\n\nAlso watched an episode of **Let's Eat**, which I'm not very into, but it makes me hungry.",

The gaslighting is so gutting &gt;!and then he somehow starts acting like he cares about her and he\u2019s a jealous suitor \ud83d\udca9\u2026!&lt; They spend barely any time on Roy to balance the horrible husband- this is not the fun comedy I was expecting. I am going to stick it out bc I need to see Jeong Suk triumph\u2026but anything short of In Ho crying hot tears of searing regret will make this a total loss. &gt;!And God forbid, if he and his mistress slink off together with their tails between their legs ISTG!&lt; I will be screaming myself hoarse.",

The good thing about this show is that it kept me engaged for all 14 episodes and I never felt the need to reach for the fast forward button. However, it's also pretty forgettable. 7.5/10 Stars\n\n**Love Mate** (8/8) - Sweet and fluffy, this one was a delight! The last two episodes didn't match the fun energy of the first six but they weren't a show-breaker. Korean BLs are doing romance much better than Kdramas nowadays. 8.5/10 Stars\n\n**XO Kitty** (10/10) - This one was a cute breezy watch. The boy who played Min-Ho (SML) not only overshadowed the ML but the FL too. Watching Korean actors shine in a western show somehow made me feel like a proud mother (and I am from India, not Korea \ud83d\ude48). 8.5/10 Stars\n\n*Watching:-*\n\n**Tale of the Nine Tailed 1938** (3/12) - So Cracky!! Logic? Who needs that when one is having so much fun! This one has the perfect blend of humor and thrill, and the actors seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves.\n\n**Star Struck** (4/8) - Doing teenage romantic angst really well. The end of ep 4 made my heart hurt. Keeping my fingers crossed that the writers don't mess up the ending.\n\n**Delightfully Deceitful** (1/16) - The first episode started like a regular legal drama but halfway into it, it suddenly became something much more! The FL is a unique character and I can't wait to see where they go with her.\n\n*Dropped:-*\n\n**Something In The Rain** - Had been planning to watch this one for a long time and finally got the push after knowing that it's leaving Netflix this month. However, had to drop it after 4 episodes as I find every character other than the ML unlikable. Couldn't help feeling that the ML deserved better than the wishy-washy FL. So this love story was dead on arrival for me.\n\n**Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story** - Got bored in the first episode itself and had to drop by the second episode. I adore the older Queen Charlotte and Lady Danbury but their younger versions left me cold. Neither the romance nor the ML gave me butterflies. I hope the makers bring the swoon back in the next Bridgerton story.",

He is smitten by her despite their huge class difference. He can't help but do whatever he can to get her to pay him attention. There is the ML's cousin who is a fading Hallayu star. He had his own heartbreak in the past. His ex is back for revenge. All their lives get entangled and to add to it one fine day the ML and FL realise theirs bodies have been swapped and they are forced to live each other's lives.\n\n&gt;!There are lots of dramatic moments including two that's right two memory losses, two near fatal accidents and comas.!&lt; I loved how Hyun Bin brings out the ML's deep and passionate love for the FL. Also loved the conversations they had on their class difference and why the upper classes want the status quo and how they ensure it.\n\nThe show was just the sort of show I was craving where leads go all out for the person they love. Recent shows have much less emphasis given to love and more emphasis on duty or other feelings like revenge. \n\nAnd Hyun Bin is so handsome. He has such a sweet smile and the dimples. \ud83d\ude0d\n\n**Tale of the Nine Tailed (1938)** (On air) - This is started off as a fun show with fantasy and comedy. But nowadays there is a added element of horror/thriller. And horror not my favourite genre.",

I think as a kdrama rookie and still someone adapting to relying on subtitles, the vibe of the episode 1 was too boring. But now I've seen so many kdramas, I still don't know the language but korean body language, mannerisms, tone of voice, kdrama quirks, humour are a lot more familiar so my unconscious mind no more goes 'oh this is weird'. \n\nI feel so soft and in love with the main couple being in love.

The villains &gt;!starting off were very good and quite creepy. But I think both parties (killer and organization) lost a bit of steam in the end when they were revealed (the killer with the bland DID plot and the organization with most being uncharismatic and boring old guys)!&lt;\n\nNamkoong Min is as always fantastic and the highlight of the show, but I think the other actors were all around solid. Here a shoutout to my man Kim Won Hae and my woman Baek Ji Won. I think their side characters brought a lot of fun into the show (as always).\n\nSadly many comments in the watching threads were often only about whatever ship the watchers liked.

Honestly when the show first started I would not have guessed &gt;!that the ML would confess first, but I'm pleased it turned out that way. I do think they have feelings for each other, but his are stronger at the moment. Which makes sense because she is obviously very focused on supporting herself as a single mom for the future.!&lt; I'm finally starting to see progress with the main couple! The secondary characters are exhausting and mostly boring to me, so I continue to fast forward through large chunks of each episode. Honestly the only secondary plot I'm invested in at the moment is &gt;!the youngest sister meeting the niece and not realizing the dad is Yeon Doo's brother!&lt;! And the ML's coworker/BIL and the pharmacist lady whose son he's now run into twice... &gt;!I can't tell if they are introducing a possible love interest (I assumed at first the show was definitely heading toward reconciliation with his wife?), or if the purpose of the pharmacist and her son is to show him how hard it will be for his wife to be a single parent if they divorce?!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Still 17 (22/32):** I have no idea why I never watched this sooner. I'm in love with this show! I started the first episode twice I think and I was a little skeptical about whether it would live up to the hype so I kept putting off the show. But it's just so sweet! I *love* a good slow burn, so even though I find myself constantly frustrated by near misses and things that could probably be cleared up fairly easily, the development of the relationships on the show outweigh the frustration. And I don't just mean the romance - there is nothing I love more than a \"found family\" trope so I am just in love with the whole household becoming one big family, including the rowing friends. I do feel bad about &gt;!poor Chan having feelings for Seo Ri, but I am hopeful he'll realize it was a \"youthful\" infatuation and that she's really just too old for him. He's so close to his uncle, I have faith the show will handle this well, even if he's initially upset/acts out. !&lt;",

It's a bit slow for her, but I'm really hoping she loves it because I just want to share it with someone! Tonight we'll see ep 4 and that should be the one to really rope her in! \n\nTrying to get through **Dr. Romantic 2.** I watched a couple of episodes of DR to meet the characters and get familiar with the hospital. Then I dropped that and started DR 2 so I can watch DR 3 while everyone is still talking about it.  Unfortunately for me, it seems to have a lot of the issues that Hospital Playlist doesn't have: &gt;!A mean hospital director, a power play, main characters with childhood or teen trauma (kdrama trope), \"enemies to lovers,\" etc!&lt;. I think this is another reason why I prefer Hospital Playlist. But I try not to compare, as they are really two different genres. I like Dr. Kim, Ahn Hyo Seop and Lee Sung Kyung, well enough. I'm on episode 5 already, so I'll give it a few more. But I don't even know where I can watch DR 3 in the US, and that's annoying! \n\nI rewatched the first episode of **My Perfect Stranger** and finished 2 episodes. I like it and  will watch a few more. \n\nI also started **Anna.** Has anyone else seen that? Is it worth the time? It's pretty short. \n\nJust waiting for the mid-June and end-of-June dramas to begin. I'm very excited about some of them! \n\nHave a good week!",

Have also listened to the songs a lot so they are so much more enjoyable seeing them play them in the show. \n\nWhen I first watched it, it did take me a few episodes to get into it. So many characters in the show, that I felt like I was trying to figure who everyone was. But once I figured it out, it was so great. Hoping it is the same for your friend!",

Super creative,really funny but very niche. If you don't want to  learn about pregnancy and the issues that follow then it won't be a fun watch.

Loved the leads, the romance evolved at a nice pace and felt sincere, enjoyed from start to finish. Thank you for recommendations for this show\n\nStarting Black Knight - I like it too once I didn't try to overthink it and let the story unfold, and focus on main characters. Kim Woo-bin is quite different in this role than other dramas I have seen - I am a big fan of his.\n\nfinished Strong Girl Bong-soon - some things I loved about this and some things not so much.  Chemistry of leads really good, but somewhat harder to enjoy when interweaving with thriller plot line which was a little triggering for me.\n\nI have some new dramas to try thanks to some suggestions here.",

            "comment": "**I Hear Your Voice** (4/18): 10th anniversary re-watch, and it's still the standard of complex, cross-genre romcoms for me. Love the slow burn ordinary daily life romance in extraordinary circumstances, the morally complicated characters, the narrative parallelism, and the critical but idealistic view of the law. The opening episodes are a great hook, and they set up all the character dynamics - especially the gender-swapped cold, arrogant tsundere!FL and warm, supportive steadfast!ML - so well.\n\n**My Perfect Stranger** (10/16): Bit disappointed that time travel still isn't more of a factor in the story, but love how the political events of the 1980s pro-democracy movement have been worked into the character's lives. Also love all the fraught mother/daughter relationships and female friendships that are central to the plot; though considering the killer was foreshadowed &gt;!to be a woman!&lt; it doesn't help narrow down the suspects on the whodunit list. \n\n**Under the Queen's Umbrella** (12/16): Enjoying this a lot less than I thought I would. Politics is my jam, but the plot is very standard struggle for the throne and most of the antagonists have Stock Villain Syndrome: they're evil and/or ambitious, and that's the sum total of their personality/development. The best part is the relationships between the princes and their mothers, which deserved more screen-time; it's a much better family drama than a political one.\n\n**Would You Like a Cup of Coffee?** (4/12): Slow slice of life that's exactly like the title beverage: warm, bittersweet and best slowly savored. A very mellow watch for my commute.",

Plot is easy and straight as an arrow, a lot of screentime for both leads, In Na on her element and a serviceable ML, secondaries more misses than hits, all the tropes of an enemies-to-lovers romcom done well. A solid 7.5, simple construction but almost flawless execution;\n\n\\- **Love to Hate You:** much more of the same, with a vibrant FL, Ok Vin can do romances well too, and a dispirited ML. The romance itself is a bit weak though, almost liked the ML-SML bromance more, but the drama does its job and it's easily bingeable, a honest 7.\n\nI also managed to fit in a quick J-Dorama in **Examination Cinderella**, a nice story of redemption and hard work paying off with quite a lot of emotions, almost great, still a 7.5 but plus for both ML and FL, amazing performances.\n\nIn progress\n\n\\- **My Perfect Stranger (10/16):** while I'm still sold on the plot, nice couple of surprises and red herrings this week, I feel it stalling as they keep running around the culprit without revealing much. Decent leads but really good secondaries, pacing is iffy but I'm still in as long as they push on the throttle a bit.\n\nI'm hopping in to **Delightfully Deceitful,** completing the Mon/Tue KDW platter, and hyping a bit for **Heartbeat,** Taecyeon one of my favorite idol-to-actor, visuals for days and the old school vampire romance back from the dead.",

Pacing is fantastic and I am genuinely intrigued by the plot. Characters are good. All in all definitely worth it right now.\n\n**Dropped:**\r  \n\r  \n**Oh! Youngsim** (3/10) \u2014 Nope. Done. Acting was terrible and story stunk. Could not get into it.\r  \n\r  \n**Non-Korean:**\n\n**Even If You Don't Do It** (7/10) \u2014 Japan \u2014 Some people can't do cheating and that is all this drama is about. I happen to love cheating in dramas. And this one is super complicated because it's about 2 couples where all 4 should be divorced and single but they haven't come to that conclusion yet. Super complicated characters. Fantastic acting. Very good Japanese drama. \r  \n\r  \n**Our Dining Table** (8/10) \u2014 Japan BL \u2014 I can't get enough of this drama. This is going to be one of, if not my top, favorite Japanese dramas of all time I think. Cute, warm, endearing. And the food leaves me hungry! The acting and micro-expressions are just very very good. \r  \n\r  \n**Naked Dining** (7/12) \u2014 Japan BL \u2014 Angst and food. So much food. So much angst! The two mains are doing a really good job too! And it looks like even more angst is coming before a - hopefully - happy ending. Can not wait. \r  \n\r  \n**Completed:**\r  \n\r  \n**Shopping King Louie** \u2014 this was such a dumb drama. I couldn't stand the premise. So many eye rolls. But the characters were adorable as all hell and I thoroughly enjoyed watching this. Very cute!\n\n**My 20th Twenty** \u2014 the story for this could have been done better and it was very weak. This could have been a strong drama with different writing and better actors. Totally forgettable filler.\n\n**Choco Milk Shake** \u2014 BL \u2014 ML's dog and cat come back over from the Rainbow Bridge as humans to help the ML. Cute and very sweet. The actors portraying the dog and cat are so spot on it's impossible to believe they aren't a dog and a cat.\n\n**Happy Merry Ending** \u2014 BL \u2014 Story pacing was odd as heck. And the conclusion was dumb. I appreciate the mental health aspects of it though. Nice to see. Forgettable I am afraid.\r  \n\r  \n**Love Mate** \u2014 BL \u2014 Funny! Incredible lead characters. So much affection! This was incredibly refreshing not just for BLs but dramas in general. Lovely watch! \n\n**A Boss and a Babe** \u2014 Thailand BL \u2014 ForceBook is adorable! Genuinely sad to see this end but excited to see them in \"Only Friends\" hopefully later this year. This drama though was mostly a happy fluffy little drama with some interesting pacing and characters. Genuinely happy to watch it. \n\n**The Love You Give Me** \u2014 China \u2014 The leads and storytelling in this are fantastic! It\u2019s basically a contract marriage, but also not, and a enemies to lovers, but also not, and they already have a kid together, who is adorable! So much misinformation and miscommunication! Very frustrating on that note, but the rest makes it worth it. And it had an actual ending which is novel for China!",

            "comment": "*Completed*\n\n**The Eternal Love (2017)**  \nI started watching this one 2-3 years ago and got stuck only a few episodes in. I decided to finally get rid of it from my on-hold list once and for all. But getting through it was a STRUGGLE. I read so many positive reviews beforehand but it was just a huge disappointment. Maybe I have been too spoiled by good quality xianxias, but the production was just so bad in comparison. The lighting was terrible. Just full on bright lights at all times in every corner. No mood lighting whatsoever. The floor choice also really bugged me. Not sure why they went with a modern looking light wood floor when every other historical drama uses dark wood. It just looked very out of place. The acting was bad, but since everyone was bad, I'm guessing it was meant to be that way? I assume they were trying to recreate older overdramatic dramas or something, but it did not work at all. Some peoples acting got better in the last couple of episodes when the setting and characters changed, but it was too late. Storyline was a complete mess. I'm gonna have to get REALLY bored to touch season 2 &amp; 3.\n\n**The Oath of Love (2022)**  \nAnother one from my on hold list that I decided to finish. I have very mixed feelings about this one. At times, it was great. The romance was very cute and interesting. But they really should've stopped at 20 episodes at most. The plot was way too sleepy to stay interested in for almost 30 episodes. I skipped majority of the side couples scenes because I found them annoying and boring. Also the plot with FL's dad hit a bit too close to home for me as I was in a similar situation many years ago. It got a bit too depressing for me, especially the last couple of episodes. It was very beautiful and touching, but just way too depressing for me personally.\n\n*Currently Watching*\n\nStill really enjoying **Back From the Brink \\[27/40\\]**, although lately it hasnt been as enjoyable as the beginning. Hopefully it's back on the right track now.   \nVery slowly getting to the end of **Secret Royal Inspector &amp; Joy \\[13/16\\]**. It's been good but I've been kinda bored with it for a while now (probably my fault for taking forever to watch it though).",

So much intrigue behind Yoon Park\u2019s character. Kim Dong-wook is one of Seo Hyun-jin\u2019s stronger pairings. The first two episodes are one of the most memorable openers I\u2019ve watched in k-drama. Very cinematic and enhanced a lot by the OST.\n\n**My Daughter, Geum Sa-wol (51/51):** Half of me can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t drop this, while the other half was\u2026 highly amused? Especially when everything gets borderline comedic in the second half. The mom is the k-drama equivalent of Light Yagami. Bit of a cookie-cutter makjang but Park Se-Young\u2019s character kind of carried me through to the end just because I wanted to see how deep she\u2019s willing to dig her inevitable grave. Also when the romance subplot ended with &gt;!the leads somehow becoming siblings!&lt; my brain melted from how it still made sense.",

That, coupled with the absolutely horrifying Auschwitz analogy dialogue, completely soured me on the whole show. Contrary to others, I really liked the relationship between Bo Ra's friend and her husband. I found it to be quite realistic and plausible. The other two couples, though, were cringe-y, *especially* the older boss/young administrator.\n\n**The Red Sleeve** (17/17) - The production quality, the cinematography (especially the use of light), the score, the acting -- all top-notch. Lee Jun-ho blew me away with his performance. &gt;!Knowing the tone of the ending clouded some of my enjoyment over the happier moments, though.!&lt; Really impressed with this, overall.\n\n**Black Knight** (6/6) - the aesthetic, the vibe, and Kim Woo Bin were very cool. The rest, not so much. The story itself was quite undercooked. It could've used another 6 episodes to flesh out the characters and the plot. For a short series, they were able to cram a lot of fun action in, though.\n\n**Mr. Queen** (1/20) - I'm not sure I'm vibing with the hokey-ness of this, especially after just finishing The Red Sleeve. I read that it gets more serious after the 4th episode, so I'll stick it out until then to decide if I'll continue.\n\n**Siren: Survive the Island** (1/10) - the design of this reality competition is really interesting.

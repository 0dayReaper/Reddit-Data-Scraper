I did catch up, bingeing Eps. 1-18 in just a little over a week. Besides the emotional impact of &gt;!Yoo-jin\u2019s escape from Joseon!&lt;, what resonated with me most in Ep. 1 are the scenes with the music box because I\u2019ve always been fascinated with music boxes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I heard the tune from the music box in Ep. 1, what came to my mind was the Christmas song [\u201cWhat Child Is This.\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ_o85Byb-g) It was only later on that I found out that the tune was actually [\u201cGreensleeves.\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pyOoCRalpGo)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeveral months ago, Band-Maid (an all female Japanese band) released their [rock version of the \u201cDawn Winery\u201d theme from the popular online game Genshin Impact](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9u63E-9pvo). Almost immediately, people began debating whether the \u201cDawn Winery\u201d theme was inspired (copied?) from Greensleeves or the Christmas song \u201cWhat Child Is This.\u201d \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Questions for those of you who are knowledgeable in music:** Were \u201cWhat Child Is This\u201d and the \u201cDawn Winery\u201d theme from Genshin Impact inspired (copied?) from Greensleeves? Or did these three songs just happen to have some similar notes or chords, and are actually different from each other?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A.

In May, an expedition of five Asiatic Squadron warships set sail from Japan to Korea in order to establish trade relations, ensure the safety of shipwrecked sailors, and to find out what happened to the crew of the SS General Sherman. When American forces arrived in Korea, the originally peaceful mission turned into a battle when guns from a Korean fort suddenly opened fire on the Americans. The battle to capture Ganghwa Island\u2019s forts was the largest engagement of the conflict.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Battle of Ganghwa \\(Ep. 1 , \u201cMr. Sunshine\u201d\\)](https://i.redd.it/7jep2fp4uupa1.gif)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Koreans who died in fighting in Gwanseong Garrison; Albumen silver print by Felice Beato \\(New World Encyclopedia\\)](https://preview.redd.it/127p9nguuupa1.jpg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=77f07eebc31cdc481f523f4b93626b82138fb89d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA-2.

In Ep. 4, Lord Ito Hirobumi mentions to Lee Wan-ik the phrase **\u201cOperation Fox Hunt.\u201d** Otherwise referred to as the **\u201cEulmi Incident,\u201d** this refers to the assassination of King Gojong\u2019s wife, Queen Min (formally \u201cEmpress Myeongseong\u201d) on October 8, 1895, by a band of about 50 Japanese swordsmen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom Wikipedia: \u201cThe government of Meiji Japan considered Empress Myeongseong an obstacle to its overseas expansion. Efforts to remove her from the political arena, orchestrated through failed rebellions prompted by the father of King Gojong, the Heungseon Daewongun (an influential regent working with the Japanese), compelled her to take a harsher stand against Japanese influence.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**B-2.

Lawton\u2019s 5th US Division, made up of 6,899 men. This action temporarily delayed the American advance on the San Juan Hills, as had been requested of General William Rufus Shafter. Nevertheless, American forces advanced on San Juan Hill the same day. Though encountering spirited resistance similar to El Caney, the Americans were ultimately victorious, culminating in the capitulation of the Spanish garrison.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Battle of El Caney \\(Ep. 2, \u201cMr. Sunshine\u201d\\)](https://preview.redd.it/yafdihflwupa1.jpg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c64f87fa271e52fdc1a9696dec77b378d6c63aaf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The capture of El Caney \\(Christy\\)](https://preview.redd.it/e225x9zdxupa1.jpg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c79ee30ade3745d560830d04e5c9cd01fab3101b)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**B-3.** Ep. 2 introduces us to (1) King Gojong\u2019s fondness for coffee; (2) \u201cGlory Hotel\u201d which will become the setting for numerous scenes in later episodes; (3) the advent of electricity in Joseon; and (4) street cars in the latter part of the Joseon Dynasty\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(1) King Gojong\u2019s fondness for coffee**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCoffee is frequently mentioned throughout this drama. In history, King Gojong did have a fondness for coffee. Most sources say that he came to know about coffee during his 1896 stay at the Russian embassy. But historian Robert D. Neff proves in [\u201cKoreans, coffee and the king\u2019s court\u201d](http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=965) (Jeju Weekly) that coffee was known and served in Joseon\u2019s royal court even before 1896.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[King Gojong\u2019s fondness for coffee provided the means for an assassination attempt against him and the Crown Prince.](http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2013/02/356_87102.html) This is the historical basis for the [2012 movie \u201cGabi\u201d aka \u201cRussian Coffee\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Im4GGJgSwDA) starring Park Hee-soon (as King Gojong), Kim So-yeon, and Joo Jin-mo (he played the role of Wang Yu in \u201cEmpress Ki\u201d).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(2) \u201cGlory Hotel\u201d is the setting for numerous scenes in Ep. 2 and  later episodes.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the article [\u201cKorea\u2019s first foreign hotels in 1880s Jemulpo\u201d](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2019/05/177_266859.html) by Robert Neff (The Korea Times) , historian and longtime Seoul resident Robert Neff describes several famous hotels during the 1880s, namely, \u201cHotel de Corea\u201d (aka \u201cSteinbeck\u2019s Hotel\u201d), \u201cHarry\u2019s Hotel,\u201d \u201cSea View Hotel,\u201d and \u201cDaibuts Hotel.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(3)** From \u201cElectricity Sends Sparks Flying in Joseon Korea\u201d by Robert Neff: \u201cWhen electricity was first introduced, many superstitious people believed that the electricity angered the spirits and blamed all their misfortunes, including droughts and famines, upon this Western introduction. As time passed electricity became more accepted and was used to illuminate not only the palace and Western homes but also the streets of Seoul. However, superstitions did not die easily.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(4) Street cars are a recurring sight in this drama**; they first appear in Ep. 2 when a street car passes between Ae-shin and Eugene. Other examples: in Ep. 11, &gt;!Ae-shin, Hee-sung, and Gu Dong-mae!&lt; meet on a street car; in Ep. 22, from a street car, &gt;!Kudo Hina shoots at the Japanese soldiers!&lt; during the \u201cBattle of Nandaemun.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom [\u201cHistory: The Introduction of Street Cars\u201d](https://10mag.com/history-the-introduction-of-street-cars/) by Robert Neff :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cOne of the earliest modernizations to Seoul was the introduction of streetcars in 1899 by an American company. It was heralded by many people as a symbol of modernization and prosperity. But not all viewed the streetcars with anticipation and delight.

These rumours implicated both the western powers that were present in Korea at the time, as well as the Japanese. These riots saw Koreans gathering outside hospitals, schools and churches run by foreigners to rail against the \u2018baby-snatchers\u2019 inside. Many in the foreign community were alarmed by the ferocity of the riots and made preparations to leave Korea, and diplomatic representatives of the foreign legations pressed the Joseon government to repudiate the rumours, which they did reluctantly.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**C-2.

The school is now known as Ewha Womans University and is one of the most prestigious schools in Korea.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cEnglish was also learned on streets and around the ports that foreign sailors and soldiers frequented.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom [\u201cImpact of English on late Joseon\u201d](https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=102361) (The Korea Times): King Gojong, the 26th king of Joseon, was the first to establish a school for English.

In previous episodes, we meet Horace Newton Allen, the American ambassador to Joseon Korea, where he\u2019s presented as a weak administrator and a corrupt official who accepted a bribe from &gt;!Lee Wan-ik (to stop Eugene\u2019s investigation into missionary Joseph\u2019s death)!&lt;. He\u2019s referred to as being a doctor, but the drama (as far as I can recall) doesn\u2019t mention him even once as a Presbyterian medical missionary.

Allen constantly warned his government that expanding Japanese power was the greatest threat to world peace.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Allen hoped to save Korea from Japanese imperial ambitions. He wished to instill this hope in his U.S. superiors, but the attitudes in Washington, especially those of President Theodore Roosevelt, seemed to be pro-Japanese.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom [\u201cProvidence and Politics: Horace N. Allen and the Early US-Korea Encounter, 1884-1894\u201d](http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/etd/ucb/text/Kwon_berkeley_0028E_13107.pdf) by Andrea Yun Kwon (University of California, Berkeley):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Few names are more recognizable to students of early American-Korean relations than that of Horace Newton Allen. And for good reason. During the twenty years the angular, bespectacled physician from Ohio lived in Chos\u014fn Korea, he supervised the kingdom\u2019s first Western- style hospital and medical school, cultivated close ties with the monarch, helped secure gold mining and other concessions for American business, played a central role in Korean migration to Hawaii, and, for nearly a decade, served as the United States ambassador in Seoul. As historian Wayne Patterson summarizes, \u201cIn the one hundred years since Korea was opened to the West no foreigner became more involved in Korea\u2019s affairs than Horace Allen.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;... Indeed in contrast to impressions that from the outset Allen was a freewheeling opportunist\u2014someone who, as one historian described, \u201cnicely combined his Presbyterian missionary dedication with a robber-baron passion for making money\u201d\u2014the evidence reveals a more complicated story.\n\n \n\n**H.** Ep. &gt;!18!&lt;: **The most-talked about scene of \u201cMr. Sunshine\u201d** &gt;!when Dong-mae cuts off Ae-shin\u2019s hair!&lt;; the Confucian prohibition against cutting off a person\u2019s hair during the Joseon Dynasty\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerhaps the most-talked about scene of \u201cMr. Sunshine\u201d is in &gt;!Ep. 18 when Dong-mae cuts off Ae-shin\u2019s hair, which is in the \u201cdaeng\u2019gi meori\u201d style of unmarried Joseon women. Finding out later on in Ep. 19 what Dong-mae did, Lord Go beats him repeatedly and warns him to stay away from Ae-shin or else be punished the way that butchers are punished under Joseon laws; Eugene goes to challenge him; and Hee-sung punches him repeatedly. Ae-shin, meanwhile, cries in shame as her grandfather comes to see her.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;!Why did Ae-shin, Lord Go, Eugene, and Hee-sung react the way that they did?!&lt; Simply stated, Confucianism, which is the foundation of the Joseon Dynasty, prohibited the cutting of a person\u2019s hair because it is part of a person\u2019s legacy from his or her parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom Wikipedia: \u201cThe Classic of Filial Piety, also known by its Chinese name as the Xiaojing, is a Confucian classic treatise giving advice on filial piety: that is, how to behave towards a senior such as a father, an elder brother, or ruler.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Classic of Filial Piety states: \u201cOur bodies \u2015 to every hair and bit of skin \u2015 are received by us from our parents, and we must not presume to injure or wound them. This is the beginning of filial piety.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;!Ae-shin herself states in Ep. 19 (around the 4:41 mark) how she regarded her hair: \u201cWe all live in different worlds, and each cherishes different things. In my world, Joseon, my family, and my hair given by my parents are all dear to me.\u201d!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerhaps the clearest illustration for the implications of cutting off a person\u2019s hair comes from Ep. &gt;!19!&lt; of the 2011 drama \u201cThe Princess\u2019s Man\u201d where Se-ryung cuts off her hair to signify that she is cutting off her ties with her father King Sejo, aka Grand Prince Suyang.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/9otvuwb5yupa1.gif\n\nBut the prohibition against cutting off a person\u2019s hair also applied to Joseon men. It was said that Joseon men would rather die than have their topknot (\u201csangtu\u201d) cut off; the topknot was their symbol of manhood, and in history, King Gojong\u2019s first order to have the topknots cut off was rescinded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Ep. 1, why did the &gt;!young Yoo-jin!&lt; cut off his hair? It\u2019s to signify his complete break with Joseon as he has then decided to join the American military.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Episode 7 of the 2014 drama \u201cThe Joseon Gunman,\u201d &gt;!Park Yoon-kang!&lt; cuts off his topknot to signify that he was cutting off his ties to Joseon and embracing his Japanese identity.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the last part of Episode 17 and the start of Episode 18 of \u201cJejoongwon\u201d (2010), &gt;!Baek Do-yang!&lt; cuts off his topknot to symbolize that he is cutting off his ties to his noble status.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpon reaching manhood or upon getting married, a Joseon nobleman or scholar pulled his hair to the top and tied it into a topknot called \u201csangtu.\u201d A headband called \u201cmanggeon\u201d was used to hold the hair in place.

[I discussed the \u201cjangot\u201d in my post about the historical and cultural backgrounders of \"Mr. Queen.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/11xf9tq/mr_queen_historical_and_cultural_backgrounders/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Ep. 9 (end) and Ep. 10 (start), Ae-shin wears a traditional winter cap called \u201cayam\u201d; it is also called \u201caegeom\u201d which literally means \u201ccovering a forehead\u201d in Korean. The \u201cayam\u201d traditionally consist of a \u201cmobu or\u201d crown (open at the top) and a big ribbon (\u201cdeurim\u201d). The tassel attached to the upper center of both front and back is mostly red in color and the strings connected from both sides are all flat braids. (Wikipedia) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**K-6. Why did Dong-mae have paintings of plum blossoms on his scabbards?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA Japanese samurai carries two swords \u2014 the longer one, around 40 inches long, is called \u201ckatana,\u201d while the shorter one, around 24 inches long, is called \u201cwakizashi.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDong-mae\u2019s scabbards have paintings of plum blossoms. The name \u201cDong-mae\u201d comes from \u201cDong\u201d (winter) and \u201cmae\u201d (plum blossom). The meaning of his name (\u201cthe plum blossoms that bloom in winter\u201d) may explain why plum blossoms are painted on his scabbards, as actor Yoo Yeon-seok explained in an interview. You can first glimpse these plums blossoms on his scabbards in Ep. 3 when he confronts the two Japanese men who were talking about molesting Ae-shin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe know from Ep. 15 that plum blossoms are the symbol of the Joseon monarchy. Could the plum blossoms on Dong-mae\u2019s scabbards possibly symbolize that he has never given up on Joseon? I doubt that very much; Dong-mae belonged to the wretched \u201cbaekchong\u201d sub-caste, and he had to escape to Japan after his parents were killed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBesides the plain meaning that the plum blossoms on Dong-mae\u2019s scabbards represent his name, I believe that, based on several scenes from Eps. 6, 7, and 24, the plum blossoms represent Ae-shin or his love for Ae-shin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(1) In Ep. 24, starting at around the 30:47 mark, when Dong-mae looks at the plum blossoms, he remembers his tender moments with Ae-shin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(2) Starting at around the 1:51 mark of Ep. 6, Dong-mae confesses his love for Ae-shin. He tells Ae-shin that he became what he is (a samurai who\u2019s working for the dreaded Musin Society) because it was the only way by which he could go back to Joseon and to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeginning at around the 3:52 mark of Ep. 6 mark, Dong-mae goes back home feeling dejected. He apologizes to Hotaru because he forgot the things that she wanted from the brush, ink, and paper store. Hotaru then writes \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot\u201d on Dong-mae\u2019s right palm. (From Ep. 7 at around the 1:02:40 mark, we can deduce that Hotaru knows that Dong-mae was secretly watching Ae-shin every time that she went to the store.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs he walks away from Hotaru who slaps him lightly on the back, Dong-mae says, \u201cThat hurts.\u201d We then see a close-up of the plum blossoms on one of his scabbards and, more significantly, a drop of water that trickles down, like a teardrop, from his scabbard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/m5wuda090vpa1.gif\n\nJoyce Landorf wrote many years ago a book titled \"Tough and Tender; What Every Woman Wants in a Man.\" Tough and tender ... this perfectly describes who Dong-mae is; he\u2019s a Japanese samurai/gangster who kills people in cold blood. But he\u2019s also tender, with paintings of plum blossoms on his scabbards as symbols of his one true unrequited love, and whose heartache flows like a teardrop from his scabbard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0uw0vdr71vpa1.jpg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1e3c58e25ce3d4a27d60806a894bd363ca380614\n\n**\u201cHeartache flowing like a teardrop from his scabbard that\u2019s painted with plum blossoms .... \u201d I love this sentimental stuff!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notes:**\n\n\u200b\n\n**(1)** In digging up the historical and cultural backgrounders of the K-dramas that I watch, I rely on English language resources on the Internet.

In my blogs, I promote and use the Plain English style of writing (thus my screen name). You might know that the US has a law (Plain Writing Act of 2010) that requires all federal agencies to write their communications in a simple and clear manner that the public can understand. Plain Writing is synonymous with Plain English (term used primarily in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand), Plain Language (the preferred term), and with Clear Writing (European Union). By whatever term is used, Plain Language or Plain English is the opposite of legalese and gobbledygook; it's reader-centered, not author-centered.\n\nProbably the most well-known proponent of Plain Language or Plain English is Bryan A. Garner. He's the author of \"Garner's Modern American Usage\" and co-author of two books with the late US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Garner has trained more than 150,000 lawyers in the US on the Plain English style of writing. He was a consultant in the Plain Language restyling project of the US Federal Rules of Court.\n\nIn my website dedicated to Plain Language or Plain English, I show how Plain Language or Plain English can be used in all kinds of writing (legal, business, science, technical, academic, journalism, etc). The website has more than a thousand free interactive exercises on Plain English and on English grammar and vocabulary. I created these interactive exercises using the freeware Hot Potatoes from the University of Victoria (Canada).\n\nMy \"Campus Connection\" blog is primarily about photography and photojournalism; I have more than 40 free lessons in photography that feature the photographs I took when I was still an English journalism teacher in high school years ago. In 2014, I began posting in this blog spoiler-free synopses by episode or sets of episodes of Korean movies and dramas. I've now written more than 70 synopses; included in the synopses are (1) historical and cultural backgrounders, (2) lessons in photography, and (3) in-depth analyses of the visuals, cinematography, and editing.\n\nP.S.\n\nI'm a big fan of the NBA team San Antonio Spurs.",

By using that Dutch angle shot of the  \u201cpangmangi\u201d combined with the shot of Lord Go looking at the family portrait (as the sound of the \u201cpangmangi\u201d continues), the writer, the director, and the cinematographer are showing a present dilemma on Lord Go's part and, at the same time, foreshadowing a later crisis in Ae-shin's life.",

I always learn a lot from your posts. \n\n&gt;When I heard the tune from the music box in Ep. 1, what came to my mind was the Christmas song \u201cWhat Child Is This.\u201d It was only later on that I found out that the tune was actually \u201cGreensleeves.\u201d \n\nI have never heared the song \"What Child is This\" before,\u00a0 but indeed the melody sounds nearly identical to Greensleeves. \n\n&gt;The problem was solved when the company that owned the street cars hired Americans known as the \u201cCalifornia House\u201d \u2014 \u201ca rough group of cow punchers, gamblers, bartenders and even a professional gunslinger who later got into trouble for shooting the topknots off of Korean pedestrians.\u201d \n\nOMG, it was intense. The guy must've been in a special frame of mind to shoot hair buns off the passers-by.\n\n&gt;For more information, surf to \u201cA Guide to Joseon Hairstyles and Headgears\u201d \n\nIt was an interesting link. Besides, it is always fascinating to look back at the historical obsession with hats. \n\nI really wonder if the \"Heukrip\" , the semi-transparent black hat worn by men, was actually effective at protecting against the sun.\u00a0 I was surprised to discover that it was made out of horse hair and I have to admit that it must've taken a lot of skill to weave it like that. It least it looks comfortable.\n\nTteoguji (the wooden frame worn by royal women at ceremonies), on the other hard, looks absolutely abysmal to wear. Daesu, the helmet-crown, doesn't seem much better. \n\nI bet that women, during the whole ceremony, were concentrated at balancing that thing on their heads.",

The movie was a commercial success and was shown in the Cannes Film Festival,  Toronto International Film Festival, Hawaii International Film Festival, Sitges Film Festival, Chicago International Film Festival, and the London Film Festival. Trailer at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tk80iXCspM\n\nRobert Neff's book \"Korea through Western Eyes\" has a lot more interesting stories. His subsequent book \"Letters from Joseon: 19th-century Korea through the Eyes of an American Ambassador's Wife\" details \"what Seoul was like during that very torrid time, everything was in turmoil, everything was in question.\"\n\n&gt;I bet that women, during the whole ceremony, were concentrated at balancing that thing on their heads.\n\nI remember a scene from \"A Jewel in the Palace\" where the Royal Physician ordered the lady physicians to massage the Queen's neck because it was strained by the weight of her hairpiece.",

But Do-mi's uniform looks like the uniforms of the Korean Independence Army soldiers in Manchuria as you can see in the early scenes of the 2015 blockbuster movie \"Assassination\" starring Jun Ji-hyun.\n\nI do wonder why Kim Eun-sook (writer of \"Mr. Sunshine\") chose the year 1919 for Do-mi to visit Eugene's grave. 1919 was the year King Gojong died.",

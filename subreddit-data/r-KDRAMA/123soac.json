I don't even know why I started watching it, I was probably in the mood for something fluffy and this showed up in my Netflix feed. I think I've watched 8-10 Kdrama romcoms now and I'm completely hooked. It's still one of my favorites, I love the relationship between the ML and FL and also with their respective besties.",

I can\u2019t emphasise how refreshing it was seeing two adults NOT act like shy virgins. I understand some audience prefer some kind of dead fish kissing or ml forcing himself on fl but i for one am done with it. The more dramas i see the more i cant tolerate dead fish fls. It irked me in the heavenly idol jesus woman you\u2019re 30 ffs. \n\nSorry i went on a unrelated rant",

Every time I've seen such a scene, it wasn't bad acting, but just an indication that one of the two people was taken by surprise.  If someone you like tries to kiss you don't want to recoil as if you were burned. They would be hurt and insulted.  But you don't immediately melt into it if you weren't expecting it.  That's just a normal reaction.\n\nThat's why you often see a scene where one person kisses the other, then backs away a little to gauge the reaction, then the person they kissed, kisses them back in earnest.",

It appears as if the fl has no desire of her own. Although this is more common in older dramas, i don\u2019t see it happening as much in the recent ones \n\nOh I actually like the ones where one backs away a little to gauge the reaction and the other one kisses earnestly.

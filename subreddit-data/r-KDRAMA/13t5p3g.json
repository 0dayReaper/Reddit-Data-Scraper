Yeo-Hee has endless love to give, showing that not all relationships are bad. Lee Rang finally meets his one true mate, and will also shower her with love. I do believe they are a match made in heaven.\n\nTheir conversation in the rain was something so beautiful. Yeo-Hee listening and walking Lee Rang through his thought process. The fact that Lee Rang could even recognize the emotions he was feeling. He's definitely not the type to say some sappy lines.

Healing is not a one and done thing. Even when you are planning a future with your sweetheart, you can still revert back to unhealthy, familiar behavioral patterns. Future Mrs. Bandit Gang has a lot of work on her hands, but I love how optimistic and determined she is for their future. At first, I was disappointed that she seemed kind of unworldly and naive but now I think she's a character that is actively choosing to live a happy life defined on her own terms. Especially more poignant is that she shares a common history with Rang, and I wish the writers reminded us a little more often about that. Basically, the character setting is a good fit, but I want more gravitas to the character to match Rang's intensity. Don't get me wrong, I'm totally on board this ship anyway lol. I'm just being a lil picky but the actress is doing a commendable job in her first role opposite the charismatic Kim Bum. \n\nI loved how Lee Yeon reacted after the bet because I have reacted in a similar way from fear, anger, loss and deep love. Lee Yeon and Lee Rang are still THE OTP of this franchise. \n\nA character I'm struggling with is Moo Yeong. He's giving us more, but how come I still find him unlikable? I'm hoping someone can help readjust my lens towards him. He's so very cold and duplicitous. This is so jarring compared to his young self, which I feel is the point, but the level of hate that he has towards Yeon is toxic to basically everyone around him--friend or foe. He's like this season's Lee Yeon from S1 lol, who I didn't care for but came around lol. I really wanna like Moo Yeong as much as I liked S1's Lee Rang, who was terrible and terrifying as an antagonist, but then still inspired love and loyalty from secondary characters. So if someone can help me come around, that'd be great.",

Both him &amp; LDW are STRONG actors who have you rooting for them to just keep going even if their characters are a little bland (like Yeon in S1) And they have this really charismatic way of bouncing off one another which just delights you anytime they share the screen\n\nMoo Yeong doesn't have that benefit cos the actor playing him is perhaps just so-so. So you're like damn you're just annoying people at this point, and you're not as attached him imo",

I feel like he turned away at first!&lt; because he has finally realized what Lee Yeon felt and didn't want to come to terms with it because then that means he would have to admit to himself all the rash mistakes he made all because he  was angry at lee yeon for leaving him for a girl. Or he might have hesitated because he is afraid of abandonment, I cant wait to see how he is going to come to terms with his feelings for her.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

I thought I saw happy tears \ud83e\udd14. Rang's initial response was probably an instinct or reflex for probably the second reason you mentioned. I really like how Rang gets growth development in both seasons. Kim Bum is doing such a great job \ud83e\udef6. In S1, Rang had most scenes that call for a wide range of emotions. S2 not only has a different life/relationship experience for him, but also other characters are emotionally mature with complex motivations. Finally, Lee Yeon gets to take a more active role in repairing the relationships that he damaged, and I think I want to see more of that actually.\n\nThe villains remain one note tho so antagonists are really coasting on creepy vibes. Well, I wasn't watching for them anyway haha.",

Rang says in season one he hadn't seen Lee Yeon since he tried to kill him, didn't he? Which is now null and void. Rang almost kills Shinjoo in the first season, not something he would likely do after this one where he was willing to sacrifice his life for him. Rang couldn't understand Yeon being so weak for love before and begrudged his love. Now Rang should have an idea of those emotions. The Rang we met in season 1 is not the result of everything we've seen in season 2 unless they pull a cheap trick of having all the past people's memories erased. That's literally the only way and it would be so unsatisfying. It would make everything we watched feel pointless. If Rang recalls any of this happening to him, the future changes. Only a memory wipe would keep status quo - but they made sure to re-emphasize that Yeon can wipe memories which makes me nervous. :(",

His motivation isn't that justified, it feel his character would've benefited more from some more backstory. Love the actor though.\n\nLee Rang is the defination of nuture impacts us into adulthood. He hates receiving love because is is not used to it. Kim Bum acted so well. He should've been more famous by now.\n\nMy theory is the Taluipa lied about the Changing the past not changing the future.  Because Lee Rang's life has changed so astronomically, there is no way he will still die the way he died. I also heard rumors about season 3, so I think change in the future will give segway to that.\n\nAnother theory, couple of episodes ago, there was discussion as to who freed CMY in the future. I know it sounds crazy but I think it is LY and LR's father. The only reason I think this is because there was no reason for the show to mention their father in E4 except to give more information on him-a) He is not a good father (maybe not a good person) b) He also doesn't follow that fox mate with one person in their entire life seeing as LR and LY are half brothers...\n\nWhat do you think?",

Realized \"holy shit, not a weakling\"...proceeds to hold non-weakling's hand first while running because \"I had to run from my stoopid brother and his stoopid friend not that I wanted to touch you!!\"\n4. Unsettled because \"wth, she saved me? That's hot? I kissed! Shock! Disengage eye contact.\"\n6. Confusion because \"why did I wander to her home when sad and lost in thought? Ruroh.\"\n7. Remembered that \"I hate people because they're selfish and will abandon me! Feelings are BAD!!!\" \n8. More confusion because \"wait...so you won't leave me? Okay, you can hug me then...\"\n9. Done being dramatic for now so \"let me help dry your hair. Okay, you can save me. Okay, you can put your head on my shoulder.\"\n10. Scared. Did something stupid but survived, uhm... \"sorry to worry you. You like hugging. Okay, I will try to hug you back.\" Awkward back tapping. \n\nI'm only remembering some things and typing on my break lol. I'm imagining Kim Bum probably meticulously planned the interactions because he just seems like he would. Maybe we'll get a real hug next? Hand holding that's not \"forced\"? Conscious \"I came to visit you because I like you\"?\n\nNo matter how this romance ends, I'm enjoying it.",

I'm having trouble keeping track of what's going on at this point. \n* Too. Many. Gods. I know it's important to the theme of the Japanese occupation and keeping the indigenous spirits and beliefs alive but it's too many to keep track of, especially now &gt;!that we have the evil Japanese demons on the scene.!&lt;\n* Moo Yeong's story is getting sidelined and it's weakening our emotional investment in what's happened/happening with his hyung. \n* Lee Rang's life keeps getting threatened &gt;!and saved by his brother!&lt; and it's a little too much, want to see him become less childish and more of an equal with Lee Yeon.\n* A few too many comedy bits. &gt;!Didn't need to see the kimchi making scene, took a lot of time and didn't add anything to the narrative.!&lt;\n\nBut here's what's still working for me:\n\n* Absolutely love the core friendship between the three mountain gods (even if it's currently fractured) and I want to see how that develops, especially now that all three of them are zeroing in on &gt;!the stone and the golden ruler. I assume eventually they will team up to fight the Japanese which will proabably be epic.!&lt;\n* Lee Yeon and Lee Rang's relationship is still touching even if I'd like to see more maturity from Rang.\n* Lee Rang and his mermaid are teeth achingly sweet, give me moar\n* Action scenes continue to be legit\n* Lee Yeon &gt;!cheating during the Go game!&lt; was so very him not playing by the rules, loved it.\n* The Japanese bad guys are truly evil and creepy a.f., having legitimately scary villains works well\n\nThere's only 4 episodes left and so much to resolve, really wondering if they'll be able to stick the landing. It will probably be an open ending to lead into s3.",

When that clicked for me, I was like \"tf this is kind of serious.\" And, I think Eun Ho's character is there to remind us of the reality for people of time period because we tend to see more of the non-human characters.",

I wasn\u2019t a fan of his and the way he treated lee rang and how he put his first love on a pedestal. I love that this season is giving more into showing lee yeon the implications of him abandoning his mountain and abandoning everything. Hong-joo is such a great addition to the cast, I love her and the mountain god trio! I hope moo-young finds the answers he\u2019s looking for and forgives yeon, hopefully he realizes yeon was just protecting him. I\u2019m hoping for eternal happiness for lee rang and his mermaid ;)",

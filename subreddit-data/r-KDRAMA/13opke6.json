The title is about an unbreakable bond so the isn\u2019t the plot twist of Yura and Dohoon discovering that they are at \u201copposites\u201d the main thing?\n\nTheir shock at discovering each other\u2019s identify just melted away without them ever having a conversation, or fear each other will turn away. Yura just appeared anxious and apologetic, and that\u2019s it. \n\nYura appeared more stressed and affected when she mistakenly thought Dohoon had an affair MORE than her being afraid that Dohoon will leave or be angry with her for concealing her shocking identity and troubled past. \n\nChief Oh\u2019s character is inconsistent as hell, not due to her poor acting but poor script. She is unconvincing as an agent.  She has fumbled in every single task - she is unaware she is being followed, unaware that someone will shoot butterfly, unaware she will be shot, hands over Mo Tae-Il willingly. \n\nLast but not least, the lazy cliffhanger ending. \n\nHonestly, I watched because it was still promising at the start, and there\u2019s some wham-bam action in the middle, and I\u2019m too invested in Jang Nara. I like Jang Hyuk as well.\n\nThe rest of the cast are fillers to be honest. They don\u2019t play a huge role except for comic relief.",

Didn't Dohoon have questions about Yura's secrets and her past? Or did he already know or it didn't matter to him? \n\nI watched this to see Jang Hyuk and Jang Nara together again, but the drama could have been so much better. I wanted to see more of them on opposite sides or being in combat together. \n\nI agree with others here that Yura's secret side should have been introduced earlier because it felt rushed that the reveal was already halfway into the drama and they had to deal with it in the last few episodes. \n\nAnd I understand showing the family side to show how important it is to Yura and Dohoon but it could have been better balanced.",

Ofc the chemistry between JangHyuk and Nara was amazing, as well as all the scenes they did both separately and together. The writers just wasted a lot of moments that would have elevated this show even more. The failed to have an open, honest talk with each other, which I believe would have been ideal after they fight the intruders in their apartment. Instead, we have them being interrupted once again, this time by the cheating father in law. Throughout the 12 episodes, there was always someone from their family interrupting. \n\nMinseo was very cute, the only thing I disliked was how she was never taught to respect the little boy's boundaries. I adored how Nara dissuaded her when she was throwing a tantrum during the recital, and when she wanted to \"reject\" everyone from her class despite them never confessing to her. I think Nara should have talked with her about following the kid so insistently, and her still being a strong outspoken kid. \n\nI did not appreciate how shameless the young couple was about ripping off JangHyuk and the dad. I do not think that just because you are family, you cannot put limits to certain things. \n\nOverall, there were several plot holes, and despite there being several instances where JH and NR made my heart flutter and god how I missed them together, I do not think I will be rewatching this show now that it is available on Hulu.",

I really wish we'd gotten the reveal earlier so that we could have more Jjang Couple being a Battle Couple fighting together.\n\nThat said, I'll say this: out of all the flaws and problems this show had, the Jjang Couple weren't one of them. Fighting, Jjang Couple! You were let down by the script, but you carried the show as best as you could.\n\n&gt;!The whole plot being unresolved and the big bad getting away unscathed... honestly I get that. In reality, the plucky heroes don't always win. The GWOT has been 22 years of a futile long defeat. Taegu getting gutshot by what's implied to be a member of the latest Korean black ops child assasin program makes sense - live by the sword, die by the sword. !&lt;\n\nBut goddamnit we watch kdrama to have an escape of sorts from the world. :V",

They had so much potential because everyone thought it was gonna be a Spy X Family kind of show but the entire series just fell so flat, with extremely lackluster writing and performances tbh. Huge disappointment. Don't stream, just skip.",

At least I like the character development of Taegu, &gt;!was so happy he turned good but they just had to kill him at the end!&lt;",

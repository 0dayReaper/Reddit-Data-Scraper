            "comment": "**Boys Over Flowers!**\n\n**Good Things:** Not sure \"good\" is a word that really applies to this drama \ud83d\ude05 BoF is a fever dream that mixes deeply problematic elements with fairytale tropes and rich, gorgeous men in fine suits to create the equivalent of drama crack. Plus it's the drama that made Lee Min Ho a star despite him sporting what may be the worst hairstyle in drama history (but it's a close race with the 2ML's shag haircut). This drama was a massive hit across Asia and it continues to influence the tropes we see in Kdramas to this day: Rich boy/poor girl, love triangle, school bullying, poor little rich boy, and enemies to lovers among many many many others. Oh and the OST is an absolute banger with earworms you won't be able to get out of your head (Almost Paradiiiiiiise)\n\n**Bad Things:** Oh my god, where do I start? The entire drama needs a content warning for depictions of sexual violence against the FL. The ML is narcissistic and entitled and basically bullies the FL into a relationship. And speaking of bullying, the depictions of school bullying are absolutely brutal (and made even weirder by the tonal shifts that have a lighthearted scene followed immediately by someone getting the sh\\*t beaten out of them). The plot is makjang on steroids (I think the craziest plot development is when &gt;!the ML's father turns out to be in a coma and hidden in a room in the family mansion while the world thinks he's dead!&lt;) Finally the acting is seriously questionable (most of the cast was made up of first time actors).\n\n**Interesting Things:** BoF is the Korean remake of Hana Yori Dango, the Japanese teen franchise that started out as a manga more than 30 years ago and has five official adaptations (Taiwan, Japan, Korea, China and Thailand)\n\n**Spotlight On Because:** This drama is kind of a must watch if you want to understand the endless references to the story and tropes that pop up in other dramas (for example, Extraordinary You is a parody of BoF).  Plus for some reason it's strangely addictive. You'll find yourself bingeing while your inner feminist sobs in a rage. We did a deep dive on BoF for the Daebak podcast.

                    "comment": "Boys Over Flowers is *the* answer to this question. If Jean-Baptiste Grenouille from Perfume melted down hundreds of Kdramas to extract an absolute, this is what he'd get. It's also very, very, unintentionally funny. The story develops in smaller, around 4 episode arcs, which is good pacing, and also keeps ratcheting up the crazy. Unlike so many modern dramas where the second half is a snooze fest, here each arc is bigger and more unhinged than the last. You thought a kidnapping was a bit much? Boom, secret coma dad! BoF is the worst but it's never boring and so incredibly earnest it's perfect viewing to make fun of, just the hair alone!\n\nI'd recommend the Korean Drama Podcast Season 1: Boys Over Flowers with hosts Will Choi, Phil Yu, &amp; Joanna Lee. Two of the three hosts had never seen a kdrama and their constant and utter bafflement is very entertaining. (All subsequent seasons are hosted by different people, so BoF possibly deeply scarred them too.)\n\n[Here is my cross-stitch tribute to this masterpiece](https://imgur.com/i1zv8AO.jpg)(pattern by aigostitch on Etsy)",

The character development (for some characters lol) too. &gt;!Young-Do getting kicked into the pool. Rachel getting SLAPPED!&lt;. Bo-Na. Too many memorable moments for a drama I thought I was going to cringe at the whole way. I liked how Eun-Sang &gt;!finally fights to be with Tan!&lt; toward the end. I love the scene when &gt;!he realises that she came back whilst he's listening to music on the bench and she sits next to him!&lt;. His face is one of love, relief and pure happiness when he sees her again. I also liked how, in spite of it being a supposedly silly high school drama, it got me emotionally involved. When &gt;!Tan !&lt;broke down&gt;! after losing Eun Sang!&lt; \\- I lost it too, as he never cried! Eun-Sang is also not as annoying as I thought she would be?! Same goes for Tan.   \n\n\n**Bad Things**: I think everything bad about Heirs (&gt;!scenes in the us, fashion, kiss scenes, Eun-Sang just STANDING THERE in the middle of conflict, mediocre plot, cringiness, overdramatic scenes!&lt;) has been covered on this sub! But I will say that I'm mad that the &gt;!older brother didn't get with his true love!&lt;! I was also hoping that &gt;!Eun-Sang's older sister would sweep in as a rich woman in the end !&lt;but that didn't happen - and I guess it was for the best as it would defeat the whole purpose of Tan and Eun-Sang fighting everyone to be together. I also did not like how &gt;!Young-Do's abuse from his dad got swept under the rug under the pretence that his dad was trying to make sure his son would not act like him in business. !&lt;\n\n  \n**Interesting Things:** How did almost the whole cast become stars? Did they play their cards right or did they get lucky? Also, I liked noticing the symbolism between Tan and Eun Sang's social classes was played out visually. From standing on opposite ends of doors, walls to some really subtle signs such as the lining of wall tiles. The parallels between Esther and Yoon Jae-Ho and the main couple were nice too. \n\n  \n**Spotlight On Because:** It's a classic, but in spite of its many valid criticisms, I think it's a tad overrated on social media. Or maybe im wrong?",

I've also blotted out some essentially triggering content. \n\n**good things:**\n\n1) the fl gets bullied so it's very satisfying when the bullies get the exact same treatment. I noted 2 instances. \n\n2) the fl is very intimidated by the ml's chaebol family members and is insecure about her financial situation. so when she finally stands up for herself and her relationship, it's such a happy moment because it's a huge step in her character development.\n\n3) flat out spoiler! I really think mentioning this will ruin the experience. \n\n4) another spoiler! \n\n**bad things:**\n\n1) scenes in the us, the eye-brow raising fashion, kiss scenes that look odd instead of romantic, a character just STANDS THERE in the middle of conflict, fairly predictable plot, overdramatic scenes (goes hand in hand with cringe). I will say that I didn't cringe as much as I thought I would for the bad kiss scenes. I read somewhere that the actress was instructed to act that way (stoic and emotionless). \n\n2) a character doesn't get with his love interest. \n\n3) I wanted a character's sibling to swoop in and \"save the day\" but that doesn't happen.\n\n4) \\*trigger warning - abuse\\* &gt;!a character is verbally, emotionally and physically abused by their parent but this is justified for a frankly, awful and pathetic reason in the end. the character does have a happy ending of sorts however. !&lt;",

Does not excuse Tan's controlling behaviour. I get that he's trying to protect her but please it doesn't mean you pull and shove her away. He does admit that his over-protectiveness is a problem however - but it would have been nice to hear it before the Young-do drama erupted and see Kim Tan incorporating healthier relationship habits. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!I do love, love the scene when he's quietly sitting on a bench, listening to music, and Eun Sang sits next to him (after she returns and decides to fight back), a recall to one of the earlier episodes. He's so relieved to see her again, the way his face lights up when he sees her, it's when the drama really proved to me how much he cherishes her- i think it's mostly down to Lee Min Ho's acting.  It's my favourite scene of the main couple. I think it's also because, for once, it felt like they were equals, which was unfortnately rare in this drama. i didn't talk about how unsettling the leads' relationship dynamic was because because i was told beforehand of Kim Tan's controlling behaviour, and so i was expecting the worst to be totally honest. Having watched I am not a robot, for some reason I thought the ML in that was worse.  !&lt;",

I hoped to see a shot of them both living together in the US in the end, but I still liked the ending.  \n\nAh I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m quite new to K-Dramas, I\u2019ve almost finished watching What\u2019s Wrong With Secretary Kim and I\u2019ve just started Legend of the Blue sea. So far I\u2019m just happy to see Lee Min Ho on my screen again. If you\u2019ve seen The Little Mermaid He just seems like a frustrated Prince Eric who just wants to con Ariel for a priceless bracelet she has on, but is drawn to her and doesn\u2019t know why. I haven\u2019t gotten controlling vibes yet. \n\nAs for LMH playing the same role, I guess I kind of see it but it\u2019s barely noticeable. His character in Legend of the Blue Sea feels like a mature version of Kim Tan. He plays a con artist with a carpe diem lifestyle who is actually a bit of a softie, kind of like how Kim Tan is a proud, arrogant bully who couldn\u2019t care less about his life but is supposedly a softie too. \n\nBut I think it works because of how different the format Legend of the Blue Sea is. Heirs is a gossip girl inspired drama, Legend of the Blue Sea is urban fantasy-esque with the reincarnation trope. I can\u2019t speak for The King as I haven\u2019t seen it yet but I really want to, even though my friends have told me it\u2019s bad lol. \n\nI will say that I\u2019ve heard a lot of positive stuff about Lee Min Ho\u2019s newest drama- Pachinko, because he\u2019s playing against his type and apparently does a really good job of it. \n\nIf you want I can update you when I\u2019ve finished each drama so you won\u2019t feel like you\u2019ve wasted your time if you decide to watch and end up not liking Legend of the Blue Sea or The King?",

            "comment": "I'm going to offer *Devilish Joy* for this. \n\nIt has all the K-tropes - childhood connection, amnesia, Truck of Doom playing a key role, rich family business with an aunt trying to kill the heir to pass it on to the cousin (without the cousin wanting it), orphaned due to a car accident, enemies-to-lovers, separated by amnesia and evil machinations, hospital(s), heroine is an actress, and more. I didn't really realise as I was watching that it did have so many tropes, but looking back, I laugh when I think about it.\n\n**Good Things** \n\nA very handsome hero, a cute heroine, the fact that the heroine is an actress who is down and out and lives like a 'normal' person, the interaction between these two, some of the humour, some interesting locations and elements, the way the hero treats the heroine once they've fallen in love, and when he's regaining his memory of her, the heroine's family interaction, the inclusion of plants as part of the story...\n\n**The 'so bad' part**\n\nAll the tropes, as described above - it's a crazy, convoluted ride because of this, and very frustrating. A lot of the storyline involving the amnesia and so on is unbelievable and ridiculous - too much melodrama and pointless pain. The evil plot by his family, the way the Truck of Doom happened and its results, and the evil plot involving the heroine's former manager/fellow actor's manager - his intentions are too dastardly to believe. \n\nI think all of the above explain the reason for the spotlight. I partly really liked this show, and partly hated it. I couldn't decide, in the end, what I thought, and remained divided.",

            "comment": "I have to go with Descendants of the Sun. There are many good things about this series aside from the great chemistry of the 2 male leads and their bromance, which is far more compelling than that with the female leads, there are interesting plot points and lots of adventure. And let's not forget the soldiers running without their shirts on! However, so many things are completely out of touch with reality. For example,  plunging over a cliff in a vehicle and then being fine afterward to surviving some strange virus to someone's heart stopping, then the next minute, they are fine after being saved in the nick of time The improbabilities go on and on. But it is all in good fun it just has flaws that could have been fixed to make it better. There is also a bit of an attitude of superiority or condescension from the male leads toward the women. I found that troubling as well. Still, it's compelling to watch.",

Uruk as a nation makes no sense - Mediterranean, on earthquake fault lines, South Uruk is Greek &amp; Slav and democratic, North Uruk is African and communist, about the only thing that really made sense was the CIA using Argus as a proxy to further their own interests and arm the people they were backing.\n\nBut none of that matters because what we are really invested in is the romance SF Captain and civ surgeon, the romance between SF 1st Sergant and Army surgeon, and the bromance of ML and SML, so all of that kinda just slides off our backs lol. :P\n\nAnd it could always get worse: My Dear Guardian, Chinese knockoff DOTS, literally has ML gatekeeping FL about how she's not a real soldier and doesn't deserve to wear the uniform, smh (and it literally ends with ML literally filming a recruiting commercial)",

But weirdly that's why I kept watching? A lot of the story made no sense, and there were so many random made up words and groups/events that were given almost zero context throughout that I honestly had no idea what was going on half the time--but it felt campy and fun, and it was full of actors I love saying really cheesy stuff constantly. I had a blast watching it. \n\nOddly enough I actually got super invested in the second season. I know that wasn't the general consensus here, but that was my experience. \ud83d\ude05",

I haven't really watched any dramas in the last couple of years, and dropped almost everything I even started. Then this magnificent unicorn came along and I was back on the drama crack, obsessively refreshing the page waiting for each new episode to drop. The wigs alone had me hooked and how they dropped most of them for Part 2 says something about why it was not as good as the first part (although the turtle of destiny was a highlight). The bad: New rules of how the magic works delivered in long expositions while everyone is standing around. Multiple scenes ending with reaction shots while everyone is standing around. Just so many static scenes of everyone standing/sitting around. What does the royal family even do?! The good: the wigs, I cannot stress this enough. Some genuinely great actors speaking complete nonsense and making it work. The friendships; this show was at its best when they were in school, it gave me Sungkyunkwan Scandal vibes. Fearless world building. Good pacing with few-episod arcs for sub-goals (will she pass the servant exam?) that kept it interesting. I might not have understood why anything was happening, but I always wanted more.",

But every two episodes it changes and focuses on the relationship of 2 other people. Sometimes romantic, sometimes not. So it doesn\u2019t get boring. Characters and stories overlap bad they all know each other. Unfortunately I think the first 2 episodes were the weakest. It picks up after that. \nThe writing is excellent. But it is about relationships so there\u2019s definitely drama but its strong point is that it is so thoughtful. So it may not be exciting enough for you. ? I liked Cha Cha but I personally think Our Blues is in another league.",

Who knows maybe it\u2019ll be the one to get me back into 16 1 hour+ episodes again! The first episode was cute, not too overly attached yet but I can definitely see liking it as it goes on! Though as someone who is somewhat into kpop the FL is definitely someone I would avoid online and in real life lol Also, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been pointed out but the scene where the artist is describing the ML\u2019s process of judging paintings is definitely heavily inspired by a scene in the (best) movie, **The Devil Wears Prada,** where someone was talking about Miranda Priestly judging clothes, which gave me a good laugh!\n\n**Recently Completed:**\n\n**Mad for Each Other** - I liked this one more than I originally thought I would!! I didn\u2019t think the leads had any chemistry at first and felt like I would\u2019ve rather them just be friends, but as the show went on I ended up liking their relationship! The ML\u2019s anger was really jarring (I really struggle with extreme anger especially male anger) but I liked that it showed him really trying to work on it with yoga and such, which made me feel better as obviously he also wasn\u2019t okay with his extreme anger. I loved how readily and easily the ML accepted Unit 705 and how he pushed others into accepting as well! I was worried that was going to be an upsetting storyline but it ended up being so wholesome! Also, I loved loved loved how the Women\u2019s Association quickly owned up to their mistreatment of FL and apologized and went to bat for her, that made me so happy!",

And, it's the first time I watch Lee Je Hoon, and maybe because in Taxi Driver he has to do disguises, I can see a lot of his expression, and instantly fell in love. I really like when he smiles, and he smiles a lot!\nAnd because of LJH, while waiting for last 2 eps of TD2, I tried to watch Tomorrow With You. Because I like Shin Min Ah too. And boy, their chemistry there is awesome. Altough the story has plotholes, ( &gt;!seriously, if you will die that day from traffic accident, just stay at home doing nothing!&lt; ) I can watch till the end because their chemistry seems so natural and the writer gave a lot of skinship lol.\nNow I want to watch Signal, but seeing the amount my chores, I'll wait untill I finish them.\nEdited:some typos",

            "comment": "Completed:\n\n* **Kingdom 2 (6/6)** \u2014 Loved this drama as a whole because every episode either gave us more to worry about or more resolution. I was going to rate it higher than season 1 because it packed a lot and also managed to not feel overwhelming. However, they did the Netflix thing - an open-ended finale that didn't need to be there cause they're hoping for more money. 8.5/10. Would recommend if you like zombie shows or thrillers.\n* **Our Blooming Youth (20/20)** \u2014 What a drag this was. Glad it's over. Started it for Park Hyung Shik, but ended up being disappointed by the pacing and romance. It started off with a promising plot, but dragged for a bigger-than-justified chunk, then rushed towards the end. How does one manage to screw up the pacing this much? I could ramble about all that I disliked, but in summary, it was boring. Now, onto the good. Park Hyung Shik really suit his role. Plus, the second couple was entertaining and cute. it was a treat seeing them on screen. That said, 2/10. Would not recommend. I sacrificed my time to warn you guys.\n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n* **Mystic Pop-Up Bar (10/12)** \u2014 I knew this was going to be more interesting. The angst! So good. I won't say this will be one of my top dramas, but it's good enough. The second couple don't interest me. I just care for the two older leads. They're so cool and interesting. They make you love them more and more each episode. The dynamic between the main characters (the trio, really) is great, too. Can't wait to finish it and rank it.\n* **Taxi Driver 2 (14/16)** \u2014 I started watching this sped up, and I don't regret it. One more week and it's over.\n* **Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha (5/16)** \u2014 It's so fun having a watch partner for this. Yes, the pace we're going at is slow because we have to work around each other's schedules, but it's great! The characters are super intriguing, and I love how each one of them plays a role in the story. Also, the further I go along, the more I see why my watch partner is in love with Kim Seon Ho. What a great actor. His eyes are so expressive. I can see this easily being a 10/10 for me.\n* **Joseon Attorney: A Morality (4/16)** \u2014 I was worried for a second since episode 3 was very all over the place, and it had barely any focus on its heart and soul - Kang Han Su. Thankfully, episode 4 was filled with him, and it was a great one. I love KHS's antics, and the chemistry between the leads!! If you finished episode 4, you know what I'm talking about. I'm dead. Honestly, this drama deserves more attention. Its over-the-top comedy, plus a little bit of revenge, I can see how it could turn out average, but Woo Do Hwan's charisma really pulls this show together. Watch it! This is one of the lighter sageuks I've seen, second to Mr. Queen. This is your sign. Watch it.",

            "comment": "Current:\n\nHealer (5/20) \u2014 I am working through my list of old dramas and this one I have been meaning to start for awhile. You can definitely tell it\u2019s an older one but wow! I can see why people say what they do about it! Ji Chang Wook is a god. I already knew that (this is maybe like my 6th drama with him? I\u2019m not sure but it\u2019s many) and he is very very good in this one. \n\nThe Eighth Sense (4/10) \u2014 BL \u2014 It will be 6 once they update with today\u2019s releases because I am obsessed with this show! It\u2019s beautiful, the story is so well done, the tension is out of this world. I have watched each episode more times than I care to admit. This show is beyond amazing regardless of BL or not.\n\nThe Real Has Come (6/50) - typical makjang weekend family drama about a contract marriage. I don\u2019t usually watch these as they are too long - and this one is a current on air one so I guess I have my weekends set until October! - but I\u2019m liking this one a lot. To the point I am actually watching it without subs and then rewatching with subs (after Viki adds them). So much drama but it\u2019s different from everything else that I am watching, I love contract marriages, and the pacing is great.\n\nUnconventional Love Story (8/10) \u2014 BL \u2014 I loved the manhwa! I am not excited by the leads chemistry but not disappointed like many others are. It fits the characters well. There just isn\u2019t that intense chemistry like in other dramas. I was super worried about pacing but they corrected that and frankly it\u2019s still pretty good. \n\nCompleted:\n\nCall it Love \u2014 This slow melodrama was awesome. It ended so well and I loved everything about it. I have a lot more thoughts but going to stick them in the on air discussion.\n\nMe, my Husband, and my Husband\u2019s Boyfriend \u2014 Japan \u2014 I watched the first 5, read the manga, then watched the last 5. I dunno. This is definitely LGBTQ+ and not BL. And it is a super deep and incredibly complicated drama. The subject matter here seems easy at first, but it\u2019s not. I have a lot of thoughts about this one but am still wool gathering. It\u2019s very good just very very complicated. And I think that you might have to be LGBTQ+ to really fully appreciate it (I am bi that\u2019s part of why I said that). \n\nNon-Korean:\n\nA Boss and a Babe (6/12) \u2014 Thailand BL \u2014 they are adorable! The characters and storytelling are awesome. This one is totally worth the time.\n\nBed Friend (8/10) \u2014 Thailand BL \u2014 NetJames are so freaking good. I don\u2019t even have words for how much I love them. And they are so pretty. Especially James, which was obvious on this last episode. This show is amazing. \n\nOur Dining Table (1/10) \u2014 Japanese BL \u2014 I watched the first episode then went and read the manga to see what I was in for. It\u2019s cute! Little kids and dogs make the best wingmen so this is perfect for that. This is going to be a fluffy, heart felt, cute little drama with little to no angst. The leads are two amazing actors who definitely will propel the storyline forward meaningfully. This is going to be a good one.",

            "comment": "**Watching**\n\n**Call It Love** (14/16) - I am so grateful to this show for &gt;!not creating any misunderstanding between DongJin and WooJoo. The reveal actually made them love each other more!  Also, I am disliking HyeSeong more and more. I didn't like how she dumped SuHo unceremoniously without giving him any kind of closure. And then she went and revealed WooJoo's secret to their mother. It's not like WooJoo is some irresponsible child who has to be taken to task! Who is she to decide that WooJoo needs to move miles away not only from the man she loves but also her best friend who is her only emotional support?!&lt; I really hope Jun doesn't end up with her. He deserves better.\n\n**The Eighth Sense** (4/10) - So raw and immersive! The intense attraction at first sight is so well done, and so is the gradual falling in love. There's a melancholy vibe that hints at a sad ending but I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a happy one.\n\n**Once Again** (33/50) - This one is as good as My Father Is Strange which is my all time favorite long drama. Had started it a few months ago and then put it on hold after 30 episodes (coz life!). By the time I got back to dramas there were so many exciting ones to watch that this one stayed on hold. Picked it up again this past week and am feeling good about returning to this crazy and warm family, and their equally crazy friends and lovers.\n \n(Thailand) **Bed Friend** (8/10) - The latest episode saw &gt;!the bad guys getting their due, plus Uea and King finally moving on from being friends with benefits to lovers. It was wonderful to see Uea's boss getting him an appointment with a psychiatrist after knowing he was sexually harassed at work.!&lt; Good to see another drama (after The Eight Sense) acknowledging that mental health issues are real and can't be solved even by the most thoughtful lover.\n\n(Thailand) **A Boss And A Babe** (6/12) - The sleazy title is misleading. This one is a cute and funny romcom between two sweet guys who are helping each other heal from their past hurts and falling in love in the process. It's become my weekly happy pill that I watch with a silly grin on my face!\n\n(China) **Love Between Fairy and Devil** (26/36) - I can see why it is so loved, but it seems Chinese drama style isn't for me coz I keep dropping every Chinese show I begin. Will finish this coz I want to finish at least one Chinese drama.\n\n**Dropped**\n\n**Unintentional Love Story** (7/10) - The least I expect a romance to give me is chemistry between the leads. The show isn't doing anything wrong but the leads look so uncomfortable with each other that it's difficult to sit through. Dropped at 7 episodes.\n\n(Taiwan) **Triad Princess** - Started this for Jasper Liu who I liked a lot in Before We Are Married (a weak show with an irritating FL but he had carried the show on his personal charm). I expected something similar here too but in the 4 (out of total 6) episodes I watched, his screentime was about 15%. Random side characters get more screentime and character growth than him. The show is centered around the FL and the people in her life, of which the ML is a small part. This shouldn't have been marketed as a romance if it wasn't one. Dropped at 4 episodes.",

Frankly, I say F that personally. It\u2019s just like here in the States, LGBTQ+ content of any type automatically gets it a higher rating, even when everything else is the same to something not LGBTQ+. It\u2019s all BS. For that I will voice displeasure but I won\u2019t stop watching. \n\nAnd I am obsessed with the Eighth Sense. This is so beautiful and wonderful that I hope I am not disappointed.",

I like most of the characters, but I'm still not a huge fan of the ML and wish the SML was the lead. I'm actually considering seeking outore of Lee Sang-yi's shows in the hopes of seeing him happy.\n\n**Strong Woman Bo Dong Soon** (12/16) - also slowly making my way through this, but it's my Saturday night show with my husband, so that makes sense. Really love the chemistry between the leads and actually like the weird gangster side plot. Nig really a fan of the serial kidnapper side plot, although it looks like will hopefully wrap up soon.\n\n**Peak Time** (4/11) - got sucked into this one when Viki recommended it and I didn't feel like watching anything else. It's actually really good and I love how overall positive it is. Plus some of the performances are ridiculous!\n\n**Unintentional Love Story** \\- slow burn and last week was all the drama, but I generally like this one.\n\nOn Hold:\n\n**Love To Hate You** \\- we got 3 episodes in and then got distracted by other things. Will come back to it eventually.\n\nCompleted:\n\n**Twogether** \\- overall a fun variety show. Easy to watch and Lee Seung-i and Jasper were fun together.\n\n**Our Dating Sim** \\- incredibly well done and instantly went on my rewatch list.\n\n**A Shoulder to Cry On** \\- great up through episode 6. I honestly think it should have ended there. Episode 7 really didn't add anything and seemed to just be tacked on to give fluff.\n\n**Jack O'Frost** \\- overall good, but the last episode felt rushed compared to the rest of the show.\n\n**From Me To You (Kimi Ni Todoke)** live-action adaptation - I actually liked this better than the anime, although I really enjoyed the anime. The writing felt tighter in the live-action version and I liked that it extended past the anime.\n\nOther Stuff I'm Watching:\n\n**Bed Friend** (Thai) - all the mess, but kind of good?\n\n**A Boss and a Babe** (Thai) - fluffy goodness with surprising depth. It's my palate cleanser after **Unintentional Love Story**'s drama.\n\n**Our Dining Table** (Japanese) - has a kind of **Old Fashion Cupcake** vibe in that it seems as much about finding yourself/found family as any romance that might happen. Really enjoyed the first episode.",

Best Song Hye Kyo scene \u2013 baiting her mom into a flame-out. Tremendous supporting cast. No surprise if Song gets the Daesang award this year.\n\n[Taxi Driver II](https://mydramalist.com/705589-taxi-driver-2)\u2013 First few episodes reminded me of US eighties drama\u2019s, A Team comes to mind which is:  simple plots and pacing, end with a hammer drop feel-good resolution. But it adds the special Kdrama coloring that I love. Pure escapism, no thinking allowed.\n\n[Oasis](https://mydramalist.com/694757-oasis)\u2013 Surprise! Intrigued because of the retro-70\u2019s-80\u2019 student uprising tie-in.  Had my doubts they could pull it off for 16 episodes; but damn, the cast and story grabbed me right away and its staying consistant so far (fingers crossed). The fact the characters have a strong vibe of the classic \u201895 Drama \u201cSandGlass\u201d  is a nice touch.\n\n**Variety**\n\n[Jinny\u2019s Kitchen](https://mydramalist.com/746907-seo-jin-s)  Follow up to Yoon\u2019s Kitchen with Kdrama\u2019s AListers opening a Korean restaurant in Mexico. Funny, entertaining, makes me hungry when I watch it.\n\n[Knowing Brothers](https://mydramalist.com/25568-knowing-bros)\u2013 Format change added a needed refresh. Still full of snappy banter when they get the right mix of guests and can be hilarious.  Completed 377 episodes with this one.\n\n***Don\u2019t make \u2018em like they used too*** \u2013  (Rewatches)\n\n[Goblin](https://mydramalist.com/18452-goblin)(2) Still moving for me. Old shows seem to get a hard knock sometimes and, yes, this one can be a little dated in a few places, but the overall tone and genuine cast vibes is still there to see.  Like Hotel De Luna, this one will survive several watches for me.\n\n[Night Light](https://mydramalist.com/20294-night-light) (3+) \u2013 Netflix.  Pure nostalgia. Kdrama 101 school in \u201915-\u201916.  20 episodes with a 3-month production shooting schedule - insane. Learned the basic chaebol/revenge storyline from this one.  Few sets, sparse scene staging, but Lee Yo Won and Uee sport the current fashion.   Advertised as a \u201cWomance\u201d and it is.  Also, it has an acting-baby Jung Hae In (DP,Snowdrop) in his first action role.",

The leads did an excellent job portraying the connections they made as well as the complications caused by their age gap -- I think they really nailed it. I did not like the &gt;!love triangle. It's incomprehensible to me why two 40 year olds would think that you could just jump back into a relationship that ended with (mutually felt) abandonment 6 years before. If the FL and SML were in their 20s, I might believe they were inexperienced enough to think this would work. Though to be fair, I think the FL was mostly just overwhelmed and confused.!&lt; \n\nIt's a busy time for me, but I feel a little lost without a drama going. So I've been looking for short non-binge dramas that I can sneak in at lunch or just before bed. I watched **Old Fashion Cupcake**, which was really beautiful. A simple story and well told. I'm currently watching **Midnight Diner**, which is an intriguing little slice-of-life.  If anyone can recommend some Korean titles, I'd be grateful!",

I'm not ready to let go of this one, yet, so I can't bring myself to watch Dr. Romantic, even though I know I'd like it. Ahn Hyo Seop as a doctor? I'm sure he's wonderful. But I'm not ready to leave this wonderful group of 5 friends who play music and perform surgical miracles every day. This drama (esp Part 2) has shot up to my top 10 of all time. I can't wait to share it with my long-distance drama-watching friend! \n\nAnd with that friend we are watching **Gu Family Book,** one of my all-time favorites. It's so good and Lee Seung Gi + Suzy are a wonderful team. It's a rewatch for me, and I'm really enjoying it! \n\nTrying to bring myself to finish Pt 2 of **The Glory.**  In contrast to HP, in which we see the very best of human beings, this one shows the very worst of human beings and is not at all an enjoyable thing to watch. I don't know why I'm subjecting myself to it (uh - it's Lee Do Hyun) and once again, I get frustrated with Netflix and general media for continually portraying the worst of human beings. Why, oh why, do human beings like to see this kind of thing? (Squid Game????)  If this exposure brings about greater awareness and change, then ok, I'm ok with it. But if it's merely voyeurism of human violence then I give the responsibility to the greedy media creators who feed us this. Rant over.",

They built up the villains too much in forced ways so that whatever retribution they are receiving in these final 10 episodes or so just don't feel enough.\n\nI've been catching up on variety shows and HaHaBus is adorable (but I like HaHa and Byul already so I'm probably biased). Their kids are funny, especially their daughter Song.\n\nMeanwhile on the cdrama side, I think I'm about to give up on **Warm on a Cold Night** (6/36) because pacing is too draggy and there doesn't seem to be any chemistry between the leads. FL's acting rubs me the wrong way because her cuteness seems too forced and unnatural. Need to hunt for a different cdrama to watch on Viki...",

Watching almost exclusively kdramas in the last few months has made me realise how different english (western?) media is... I was cringing at a lot of scenes in the early episodes and the amount of focus on sex is off-putting. I already felt like there's too much \"adult content\" in media but after watching so much sweet/cute/awkward/protective flirting and love interests it's definitely a very obvious contrast to me. Of course it's possible that's the case with kdrama as well and I just haven't come across those kinds of shows yet, but this is what I noticed. \n\nBefore that I watched **Legal High.** I didn't think much of the story but still enjoyed it. I really like over-the-top eccentric characters so I liked Mr Go despite him also being a greedy money grabber ! :P \n\nNow I'm watching **Summer Strike.**",

LJH is one of my favorite actors. \n\n- welcome to Waikiki 2. This show really delivers with the comedy. Definitely still over the top, but at least it\u2019s expected now. I remember being shocked for awhile while watching s1. \n\n- be melodramatic. Just completed episode 1 and I like it a lot so far. My kid was watching it with me and the whole suicide attempt showed up and I had to put it on hold. I was really upset for that girl that had the baby and the whole situation she was stuck in.",

Secret Life was a bit frustrating, as I became impatient for the central secret/misunderstanding to be dealt with since it was standing in the way of the relationship. And the show dragged it on.  A bit like I am not a Robot, if you have seen that.  Still, it was a sweet romance with the usual tropes and happily ever after ending.\n\nHello, Me is completely different.  It's a healing drama.  If you like that type of drama, you'll be sure to like this one.  There is a romance but it's very toned down, and is not central to the plot.",

Brilliant. Amazing. I was addicted. The story is really good and the characters are great. Even the very minor characters are fantastic and bring a lot to the show (I can't even decide whose my favourite. Actually no, that's a lie. It is Jingyan.) The acting was really good, and the production itself as well. I can only heap praise on basically every aspect of it.\n\n*In-Progress*\n\n**Queen Seon Deok (3/62)**: Thanks NiF for resurrecting my love for long historical dramas. I have great expectations for this one. Female protagonist and female villain. Kim Namgils star-making role. So far so good.\n\n**MIU 404 (4/11)** (Jdrama): Very fun and cute detective show with heart. The main duo bromance is fantastic but the whole group is fun.\n\n**Payback: Money and Power (2/12)**: I actually had this on hold, as I took a longer break from kdrama. Now I can finally finish it.",

Not super excited about the political machinations which are typical of the genre, but I'm watching it anyway.  The show does a good job of building up the tension.  We can all predict what is going to happen and feel like we are watching a train wreck that is just about to happen.\n\nBig spoilers ahead :\n\n&gt;!I am at the episode where he is exposed as the crown prince and has to go back to the palace.  My heart is simply breaking for him.  He had always been a sad and lonely figure before but now the pathos is unbearable.  After experiencing happiness for the first time since his coronation as Crown Prince, he lost it all.  He is more isolated than ever, as his entire entourage was killed.  His enemies are pretending to be his friends and he can't tell because he lost his memory.  I had some hope that Doh Kyung Soo at least could be an ally.  I felt like it was yet another nail in the coffin when he tentatively asked Kyung Soo for his friendship and was flatly told no.  The show emphasized his isolation when he replies, no we can't be friends.  Drama gods, why so mean??!&lt;",

Not bad by any means;\n\n\\- **Joseon Attorney (4/16):** amusing though pace is slow and I'm not totally sold on the FL's Mother Theresa act. ML is better with his shades of grey, chemistry is there but the plot needs to push the throttle more.

PBG has such unique facial expressions he's always fascinating to watch. Am I the only person who thinks KYJ looks a little like a young Drew Barrymore? I think it's the mouth.\n\nAnyway, tragic childhoods, secrets, rebels, Crown Princes, hot bodyguards, there's nothing unique about the plot but that's what makes it comforting. You can just settle in and weep 'til your throat hurts.\n\nA couple small notes: After seeing Kwak Dong-yeon in several dramas, I'm almost ready to dub him the Korean Sean Bean, just because (mass spoiler alert: &gt;!his characters tend to die a lot!&lt;). I have wept many tears over KDY.\n\nThe melee scenes are so perfect, imo! Balletic, well shot and edited, really affecting and exciting! Don't draw those swords unless you mean it (although in the closeups you can totally see how blunt the swords are).\n\nJJY as the 2ML is super adorable and fights like a demon; he's great at making that face that says, \"I just realized I'm the 2ML in a love triangle.\" The face of goshdarnit.\n\nThe fat suit on the Princess is a thing. It's terrible, and I just kinda sighed and let it go.\n\nHaving every loose plot thread tied up in under a minute in the last episode was really satisfying!\n\nOh man, the kissing is not good. It's a lot of face-mashing while they look like they just swallowed bitter medicine. Can't have everything, I guess!",

I just watch him the whole time! Episode 13 was great stuff - the chase! The fight! The danger! Love realised and felt! \ud83d\udc4c\u270a\n\n*Cang Lan Jue* (35/36): My re-watch is almost finished \ud83d\ude22. Episode 35 is so good. So good. They're all grown up, mature and wise and ready to sacrifice.\n\n*Deivery Man* (11/12): I've liked this more than I thought I might. Yes, it's clich\u00e9d, no it's not perfect. But it's cute, and heartwarming, and funny. I love the dorkiness and the heartfelt-ness, and how everything is so loaded with necessity/danger/things that have to be done, and the bravery and excitement that brings out.\n\n*The Great Doctor* (17/24): Finally, finally, she's woken up to how fantastic and selflessly protective of her and everyone in the world the general is!! Oh my gosh; it only took her months and his certain death many times \ud83d\ude44. But it's still annoying. I'm watching still mostly for Lee Min Ho/Chai Yong.\n\n*The Secret Guesthouse*: It's okay. I just know things are going to go a different way than I want them to. But it's intriguing, and we're getting clues, but then more twistiness, so it keeps your interest just enough. They've given the heroine too much makeup, though, and this is distracting for me. The men are all good actors.\n\n*Nothing But You* (12/38): I tried this Chinese modern series out, based on some positive comments, not expecting a lot, and really liked it! Have binged a little, and now waiting for increased translation, since the last couple of episodes were getting pretty hard to understand and enjoy for that reason. Some elements I really like in this.",

The crown princess lost her love, and he lost his life.  But still, they were both victims of the main villain!&lt;\n\nWatching both shows is making me reconsider my propensity for rom-com.  With romcoms, I always tend to focus on the OTP and will get impatient with the story.  I'll get frustrated because the relationship is not going fast enough, that we are not getting enough cute moments with the OTP and of course, I'm always pissed at the unavoidable noble idiocy/penultimate episode breakup.\n\nIn 100 days my prince, I had hoped to avoid this trope.  &gt;!Of course, their separation when he had to return to as the Crown Prince was unavoidable, but the later part, where she decides she will not marry him for his own good was a clear example of the Noble Idiocy trope.!&lt; \n\nAnyway, comparing the two makes me realize that without a romance in the mix, I can focus on the story instead of being frustrated.\n\nDoes anyone feel the same way?",

The romance between the FL and Healer is dumb. I mean how can she like some guy just based on rumours and even date him? This despite the detective's warning that he might be a killer. I rather prefer if the romance would have been between the FL and the alter ego Park Bong Su. She even goes on a date with Healer without seeing or speaking to him. I don't see any chemistry between the actors either. The whole plot with the five friends is also boring.!&lt;\n\nThe Fiery Priest (4/20) - After a bad first 30 minutes this show has improved and is quite interesting now.",

I happen to have read the manga, seen Jackie Chan's film, so know what happens later.  I'm SOOOO glad I saw it before I saw Healer!  \nMin Young is always good, but she excelled in Healer.  That romance is just the most angst-free in KDrama history, frankly, and totally sweet.  She BTW doesn't know EITHER of these guys when she crushes on them - &amp; the person she actually falls for, you know, IS Bong Soo.  People who think it's boring just can't follow the plot very well - it does have a lot of flashbacks.  Important ones.  The whole story of the 5 friends is the ENTIRE point of this drama in fact.  As for chemistry - pffft.  They got best couple for 2015, you realize.  Your insistence on no chemistry is simply a very very minority one.  I've watched Healer 9 times now, rewatch it every December.  It never gets old - I keep finding new things I hadn't noticed.  It's KDrama crack, just a basic how-to in writing a thriller with a romance interwoven.",

Watching namkoong min in both gong shim and hot stove league felt like whiplash as changing between the goofy dan tae in gong shim and sexy/mysterious mr baek in HSL was soo confusing but fun! \n\n Current\n\nBeautiful gong shim-11/20(current)\n\nI am not a robot-8/16(current)\n\nFind yourself - 10/41(current)\n\nTaxi driver S1 - 11/16(current)\n\nRookie historian- 0/16(hiatus/current)- i might drop but this is the most K dramary of K dramas ive ever seen; if you asked me to outline a historical k drama this is the blueprint but idk if ill continue this due to that feeling. \n\nMemories of the alhambra- 0/16(just started)\n\nDropped dramas\n\nWitch at court; 3/16(DROPPED)- I hate Ma I-Deum with a passion but the general show was only hanging on with Yoon hyun min and the legal plot lines. Otherwise it was chaotic, confusing and frustrating. \n\nLove 020-0/30 (exchanged for the movie- reading the comments on r/cdrama put me off and its quicker to watch the movie)\n\nMy golden life-0/52(DROPPED- the cast and storyline felt wayyy to familiar/similar to once again soo nope. \n\nI need romance-2/16(DROPPED- as much as it\u2019s entertaining, ep 2 was just EMBARRASSING. Like is she not ashamed?! )\n\nGirl from nowhere-0/13(DROPPED- wayy to heavy in \nthe subject matter for a drama personally :( \n\nDoes anyone else have a phase where they will finish a k drama and then drop like 5 or 6 after to find another good drama? Like my finishing:dropping ratio is insane.",

I was uncertain about it as it seemed reminiscent of **My Liberation Notes**, **My Mister** and **Just Between Lovers/Rain or Shine**. While I loved MLN, I had trouble going through initial episodes of My Mister (which I still ended up enjoying) and I dropped JBL, which I found too slow. In other words, for me, Call it Love was going to be either a hit or miss. \n\nAnd a hit it was! The characters seem like real human beings. And, I do not say it often, but the ML is such a good man! This is a type of person who will go with you through water and fire. I find that his ex is such an idiot for not seeing it. What were you thinking, woman!\n\nIf it seems that I am crushing on the ML, it is because I totally am. (My husband is still better, but he is a deserving 2nd best)\n\nWhat actually happened, is that I had a long plane ride and I downloaded few shows. Because I wasn't sure about this one, I only downloaded 6 episodes. When I got to the end of the 6th one and realized that more was not available on my phone, I think that you could hear the loudest silent \"Noooooooooooooooooooooo!\".",

Workplaces are not age segregated like school, so you\u2019re gonna have a bad time if you can only work with people within three to five years or so of your age.\n\nAge is just how many times you\u2019ve been around the sun.

I seem to see this complaint often since I started watching kdramas, and it had honestly never occurred to me that an age gap would be a problem (beyond underage situations).  I also have multiple family members with large age gaps in their marriages.  \n\nI guess that if one is underage or close to it, an age gap could present a natural power imbalance. If you aren't used to adults being anything other than authority figures, it could feel that way. But that fades so quickly once you're out in the world interacting with all ages (and, let's face it, seeing how immature people of all ages actually are *ahem* halmeoni of **The Real Has Come** *ahem*). \n\nBut I also wonder if this attitude could be culturally-based or gender-based? In just throwing this idea out there because I was in a Noona romance kick for a while.vvI can't think of any dramas with big age gaps where the men are much older. Hospital Playlist's Jung Wan and Gyeo Wool, maybe? Even there, what would weird me out is the fact that he's her teacher/boss, not the age difference. But I'm fine with it, because they're both mature and careful not to let their relationship get in the way of work.",

Until I hit episode 17 (out of 24) and suddenly, I'm transfixed. Now it's no longer just the amazing OST and cinematography that keep me going, but the character development, the moral heft of the story, and even the plot have now hooked me.\n\nI also watched 3 (?) of 10 episodes of **Why Didn't I Tell You a Million Times?** the jDorama that recently landed on Netflix. At first I was disappointed, this doesn't remotely compare to **First Love**\\--and the aching beauty in that drama. But I now realize that it isn't really a romance, or at least it isn't *just* a romance. I'm intrigued by the mystery element.\n\nAlso, so far I'm loving **Moment at Eighteen** (3/16)**.** It is moving slowly, and maybe it will get bogged down in the middle, like so many dramas do, but for now I find it captivating.",

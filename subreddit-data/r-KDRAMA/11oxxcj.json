I do have to say that I did not enjoy the \u201cnot like other girls\u201d concept. It\u2019s ironic because they attempted to address misogyny, but the \u201cnot like other girls\u201d concept reinforces misogynistic views. All that aside, as someone who works in the legal field, I found it hilarious that reason &gt;!for their break up was not that an attorney-client romantic relationship is highly unethical and a major conflict of interest, but that she\u2019s a \u201cloose woman\u201d destroying his reputation. !&lt;It was a real effort to suspend disbelief about that.",

Others that I still have access to no longer have English subtitles (which\u2014sorry to say\u2014 I still need.) Vicki and KOCOWA are completely unavailable and there\u2019s no fooling any of them with a vpn. One good thing is that I can watch Phantom Singer 4 on jtbc which I couldn\u2019t do in the US. No subtitles but with a music show, I can do without. So this is the end of my long lament. Thank you all for listening. \ud83d\ude01",

I think one of the main themes of the drama was about how inherited wealth leads to utter entitlement and how heirs don't feel the need to contribute to society or create new wealth but instead do things at any cost, to their families and to the world at large, to retain their wealth. With the ending of the drama, I think this theme was much better highlighted. Especially with the heirs to &gt;!Soonyang showing their true, ugly faces in court.!&lt;\n\nEdited my poor grammar",

I'm already loving the fashion and the interior design. Clearly we are in Cadillac PPL territory with the amount of car shots in the first episode alone. Intrigued by the story and hoping it gets better!\n\n*ETA Ep 2 Thoughts*: Loving the hand to hand combat scenes, absolutely a treat. The shaky cam treatment of these scenes though is definitely *not* a treat. I get that they are trying to go for tension and thrill but the shaky cam is actually detracting from these combat scenes since the shaking throws off the flow of the fighting. Story-wise, we've gotten to the &gt;!political!&lt; part of the set up and while I don't love it, I suppose it does raise the stakes. I was hoping Hatch would get more attention because the over-the-topness of it all was fun to watch but I think it's going to fade into the background.",

I liked Under the Queen's Umbrella more, maybe because I like how it it mirrored a lot of modern day topics, or how it felt like the sageuk version of Sky Castle. I watched this one as it aired so it was a nice treat for me to look forward to the weekends. The Red Sleeve was definitely a memorable drama, and a very sad one as well. Both dramas had a lot of sad moments, which also made it very emotional for me.",

So so satisfying!!! I was so worried that they might trip up right by the finish line *cough* Reborn Rich *cough*\u2026but nope! Fantastic from start to finish\n\nI thought it was interesting that this is my first kdrama where I actually saw characters actually taking drags from their cigarettes since it\u2019s not a regular TV broadcast. The violence was too intense for me (a wimp) but I understand it was necessary otherwise Dong Eun\u2019s motivations make no sense. I was definitely surprised by the brief nudity and sexual content - just a heads up in case you\u2019re planning to watch with your teens/parents and don\u2019t want them scandalized \ud83d\ude05\n\nThe romance was minimal but I loved it - it buoyed up the series from being too mired in grief and anger - that ending shot of the two of them together was perfection! It\u2019s my favorite kind of ending - where you come away knowing the story isn\u2019t over because they\u2019re going to continue kicking down doors together off camera. And agree with everyone saying Jung Sung Il (Do Young) and Song Hye Kyo need to do a romance melo together - something intense because these two bring the heat!! So glad that SHK found such a perfect role for herself - she was \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25",

It was 12 episodes so didn\u2019t quite have enough time to get draggy and annoying thankfully but also it doesn\u2019t have that X factor to make it addicting or memorable. I like the actors for the most part but I was expecting more light hearted comedy based on the posters but it wasn\u2019t really fun (esp compared to Forbidden Marriage which I\u2019m also watching). Also I have to admit there\u2019s not much chemistry between the leads, they seem more like siblings tbh. I like Kim Min Jae but his other dramas are much more engaging than this one. Kim Hyang Gi hasn\u2019t really impressed me in her dramas so far, she feels more like a sidekick here at times. \n\nStarted **Divorce Attorney Shin** but fell asleep in ep 1 because I was tired. I am impressed by how different the character is from Hwang Si Mok but kind of like seeing JSW embody such a different character too. The production quality/directing/cinematography/colour grading is kind of throwing me though. It feels like a family/weekend drama or like something filmed much older and a bit outdated somehow.",

And as if that wasn't enough, he kept confessing his feelings (that he all of a sudden developed in like 10 minutes, very genuine indeed) even though she told him multiple times that she has a boyfriend she's seriously dating and then he even said he wanted to sleep with her. Oh my god. And all of that happened in the first fucking episode. This is probably worse than what I experienced in Nevertheless and not what I want from a love line in a K-Drama.\nIm not gonna drop this season for the sake of the FL and Teacher Kim and the buildup for S2 but damn I never wanted to drop a drama after the first episode.

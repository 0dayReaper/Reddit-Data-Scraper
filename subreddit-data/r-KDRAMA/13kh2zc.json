    "postText": "Grab yourself a knee rug and a mug of hot chocolate, it's time to reminisce those old time dramas from days gone by of pre-2019. Maybe you were  around when they aired for the first time and want to take a trip down  memory lane by watching them on the box. Maybe it's your first time  through.\n\nThis is our weekly discussion exclusively for those older Korean dramas on your currently watching list. We don't want to hear about the currently hyped dramas here, so please keep it to the older stuff on your watch list.\n\nReminder, **we advocate the use of legal streaming sources wherever possible**. Any comments mentioning illegal sources will be removed and links will lead to bans as per [our rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_linking_to_illegal_sources).  As it is very hard to find many of the really old dramas rather than  asking users \"where are you watching?\", we suggest you instead ask \"did  you find a legal source?\". See [our policies on streaming sites and VPNs here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/streaming_sites#wiki_vpns).\n\nCrazily enough not everyone has watched these classics yet so **please remember your spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;. For more detailed guidance on spoiler tags and when to use them, check our [Spoiler Tags Tutorial](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags).\n\n\n***Just In Case Resources***\n\n[FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and [Netflix FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101/netflix_faqs) **|** [Glossary](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions) **|** [Latest On-Airs](/r/KDRAMA/search?q=flair%3Aon-air&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=week) and [On-Air Roster](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episode_discussion_roster) **|** [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) **|** [Where To Watch *aka* Legal Sites](/r/kdrama/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas) **|** [Everything In Our Wiki *aka* Wiki Homepage](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/index) **|** [Get Recommendations For Your Next Watch](/r/kdramarecommends/comments/hl34w7/rules_resources_and_a_guide_to_navigating/)",

The premise of the show is crazy and almost every character is a hot mess. The main antagonist isn't revealed as such until about 2/3 of the way through, and exists primarily as a sort of excuse to show the audience that other characters aren't as bad as we thought they were. The resolution of the main plot point (ML's &gt;!visions of his own death!&lt;) is way too pat, which leaves the viewer feeling baited. The FL has big Manic Pixie Dream Girl energy. The supporting cast spend the entire show in pure scenery-chewing mode: ranting, raving, jumping on furniture, babbling in foreign languages, beating the crap out of each other, declaiming long monologues, etc.\n\nStill, for all its flaws, it has *something*. It's one of those shows that, despite all the silliness and slapstick, manages consistently to hit real emotional notes. The chemistry of the leads is fantastic. Sometimes (not often) it is genuinely funny. If you're tired of the same-old, same-old in kdramas and want a palate cleanser, you could do worse.",

It's kind of like a Kdrama version of a classical tragicomedy, complete with hubris front and center and a supporting cast Greek chorus.\n\nIt's amazing that the same screenwriter went on to write **My Mister** and **My Liberation Notes**.",

I'm currently watching a bunch of on-air shows right now so I don't know what made me want to go back and watch it again,but after the first episode I couldn't stop! I binged all 16 episodes and it's such a good, healing show. I can definitely say this is my \uc778\uc0dd \ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8 (my life's #1 drama). So many great actors and cameos. Lee Kyu Hyung in particular did a stellar job potraying Han Yang. It absolutely ripped my heart into shreds (even the second time around) when &gt;!he fell for the trap and got caught doing drugs as soon as he was released!&lt;",

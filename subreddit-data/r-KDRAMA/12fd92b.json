            "comment": "There's a persistent fight scene in Kdramas where the male or female lead will grab the sharp blade of a knife or sword with their bare hand and push back the opponent. The camera zooms in to show the blood dripping off that razor's edge.\n\nMy toes always curl when I see this because I've accidentally nicked my finger while chopping carrots or onions and know how long it takes for that cut to heal.\n\nNonetheless the hero/heroine gets bandaged up and they're often able to wield a sword or fire a gun in the next scene. The thought of that soft flesh and tendon squeezing down on honed steel makes me wince. I'm twice as careful when dicing or julienning veg.",

These 2 specifically always star in dramas that lose my interest really quick. I loved fight for my way though so this could be different?\n\nUsually I find that I cannot set apart IU from her character, I'm not a big fan of her as an actress and Park Bo Gum usually is in dramas I drop and don't really like due to lack of chemistry with the cast or the story not being compelling. He's often in funnier dramas that are meant to be funny but that end up losing an important element which is having me care about the story and the characters.",

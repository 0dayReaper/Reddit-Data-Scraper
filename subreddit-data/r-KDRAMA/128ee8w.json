You are wearing the wrong clothes, the wrong hat, you have the wrong sex, you are in the wrong century, and now you are even in the wrong quiz. You came out of Sungkyunkwan Scandal and can never go back. But don't despair! Even if you are different, you can still find friends and find your own place in this drama.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!and that's actually a faaar to accurate XDD!&lt;\n\nIn Hyena I am: &gt;!Yoon Hee Jae, I gotta watch this, but from the description I think that's a good fit for me!&lt;\n\n&gt;&gt;!Learn to balance ambition and truth.!&lt;",

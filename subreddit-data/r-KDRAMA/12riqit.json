Yoo In Na and Park So Jin did really great in this episode. ML was a jerk but Ex BF is a whole new level. Every character is interesting and their dynamics got me so invested.\n\nThat conversation between the married couple hits hard!!!

I want her to understand that there\u2019s more to life than optics! I am rooting for her growth!\n\nI am hooked and I hope the show attracts more viewers bc it\u2019s really worth it especially for romance/slice of life fans like me. \n\nThe preview for Episode 4 is killing me.

Very emotionally intense and sincere, which I didn't really expect from this drama.\n\nIt even humanised Juhwan at times\u2014his side of the conversation with Jinho made me understand him better, and it also filled out Bora's characterisation as a girlfriend who acts laidback on the surface but smothers her partner with unspoken expectations and score-keeping. Of course, Juhwan should have talked to her about it and/or dumped her instead of conducting such a sordid, pathetic affair behind her back. The fact he doesn't seem to believe Bora genuinely loved him, and told her she was like all the other women attracted to his background and status instead of his personality, was in some ways the most painful thing he said to her IMO; it's clear that she at least \\*believes\\* she was deeply in love with him (though God knows why, as they didn't seem to have anything to talk about). So for him to trivialise her feelings and admit he dated her despite thinking so poorly of her and their relationship is quite the rug pull.\n\nHowever, it's clear the relationship had to end, so ultimately I don't feel that bad about it. Bora's initial resolve to forgive Juhwan before he'd even apologised and use the affair as an opportunity to train him up as a husband was a realistic but immensely frustrating reaction and that's why the stuff she overheard at Jinho's bar felt more like a necessary reality check than a betrayal IMO. She should have been thinking the things Juhwan was saying!\n\nJuyeong's argument with Jinho, on the other hand, was gut-wrenching. I felt super bad for her. That was a great scene and I am curious to see how their marriage progresses.\n\nOn a related note, I really like that Juyeong and Jinho live in a cozy and even slightly dank older apartment that they obviously inherited from a relative. I'm tired of the showroom apartments everyone has in kdramas (unless they live in a rooftop room, of course).\n\nAnyway, I gotta say I look forward to the sister's plotline. So far her scenes have been a pretty fun and realistic exploration of dating/romance/nightlife for young people. The creep who offered to give her a ride and then tried to take her somewhere else to have sex while claiming she'd obviously consented was extremely familiar, and the way she refused to open her admirer's messages so he wouldn't see she'd read them, but then he did and was happy he wasn't blocked, was quite funny.",

That scene where she was crying as she put make up on or when she spotted her reflection on the store window and hated seeing the lipstick on her mouth. That entire walk and fight back. And then that tragic but hilarious segment where the two of them inconvenienced  the garbage collectors by getting on the truck and insisting that they're garbage to be disposed of. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude48 The whole episode was a rollercoaster of emotions but beautifully done. We all know that Ju-wan was the wrong-doer in the situation but the show took the time to let us see the cracks that had existed in their relationship, the ones Bora had papered over for a long time. And I think that made the break up more emotionally resonant when they finally began yelling at each other.",

I hate Chansung\u2019s character so much but omg he makes me laugh out loud \ud83d\ude2d. \n\nAnd Yoo In-na looked so hot in that golden dress despite her \u2018joker lips\u2019. \ud83d\udd25 \n\nI loved the first 4 episodes. I truly hope it becomes one of my favorite dramas of this year because I\u2019m loving it a lot so far.

I know it can backfire if she says her ex cheated because he's not known to the public so he can't defend himself. People can say she's lying about that too. But at least in that case the whole situation would be laid out honestly. \n\nBut that isn't even the real problem. It's that she's hiding his cheating from her own family. That's the part that makes least sense. We don't know what her mother is really like but there doesn't seem to be any reason to hide it from her sister! \ud83d\ude48\n\nI really love Inna and I was loving the drama so much until this.

So if anything I think you just have a double standard for what 'counts' as a break down and you say that much worse breakdowns by male characters don't count because male characters get away with more... that is likely true,  but it doesn't mean it's any less of a breakdown.   \n\n\nBut notably in Mad For Each Other, written by the same writer, the male character did almost lose his job because of something unhinged he did related to the female lead after a 'breakup.'",

I think the repeated having to lie and try to control her image literally just pushed her over the edge into a mental break, and this is not something she could have 'controlled' just by using normal cognitive resources or following normal face-saving habits.  \n\n\nI can definitely see that this particular out-of-control behaviour (humiliation via an embarrassing speech at a public event) is different than the type of out-of-control behaviour typically shown by male lead characters in romantic dramas and other dramas, I'm just not sure that's a bad thing since men are generally more likely to be violent when they get 'out of control' while women are generally more likely to burn bridges with verbal insults etc. so I find it pretty realistic. I also think male characters are shown totally wrecking their lives way more often in the kdramas I've seen compared to female characters, but maybe we're just watching different shows.",

Protect them at all costs!! She knows she failed Deborah but damage control is more important than lamenting about the past.\r  \n\r\n* Also, the way they portrayed the &gt;!true colors of social media!&lt;. Legit, everyone wants to jump on the hate bandwagon and drag a person through the mud because they did something wrong. The cancel culture is a bunch of bored people living their lives by hating on people they envy tbvh.\r  \n\r\n* Su-hyeok admitting he was &gt;!\"super cool back then\"!&lt; and Deborah straight up &gt;!bawling through the window of the bus!&lt; had me cackling so bad XD WHAT'S THE SONG THOUGH, is it an original OST?\r  \n\r\n* Although that &gt;!flashback!&lt; shows Su-hyeok wasn't always a cold boyfriend. He showed up for Yu-ri, he was thoughtful. Perhaps, he unintentionally stopped putting in effort and Yu-ri pretended to be okay with it until she wasn't. \r  \n\r\n* Ahhh... two absolutely broken-heart people with a history of a breakup that they never saw coming...

I see why he feels that way, but he should't have cheated. \n\nBora, in terms of relationship with her ex, is not great either. I mean she puts so much pressure on him to perform. Actually, I firmly believe that Bora has never loved her ex. Even when she is crying for the break up, you never see flashbacks of them having good moments together. I think that she is crying more for the idea of the boyfriend that she lost than for the actual person that is no longer in her life.",

I understand that she's grieving but when she applied makeup to meet Juhwan, I was like ''GURL, pls, he doesn't deserve it'' like, just leave him be, let him stay outside if he wants to keep waiting???? Idk, it annoys me that she's still trying to safe the relationship, much less to a trash like him. Like, whyyyyyyyyyyyyy. Also, all the gaslighting.. those are very realistic lol. \n\nANDDDDD the sister!! She's such an insufferable character. I could stomach her being spoiled, and not having good relationship with her sister but the moment she was like ''It's probably your fault in this argument'' I was like ''???? kick her out''. And the fact she texted Juhwan???? Gosh. That was the last straw lol. Why can't she be the one to be there for her sister if she's really worried? Why on earth do you text your sister's ex who cheated on her and isn't even sorry about it? ALSO, Bora's mom getting mad at Bora for scolding her sister, gosh. Bora's family is toxic. \n\nI like the part when Yujeong called out her husband for making all these insensitive jokes as if women / wives are a burden. And why does he thinks it's okay to justify / help a cheater? What a joke. \n\nThe boss was probably the only fun scene this episode had lol. I don't agree with him removing the partitions and not respecting his workers boundaries but as compared to the other toxicity we saw in this episode.. that one was like a slap on the wrist haha",

(Presumably so she can pivot to being totally honest about her failures in her book and shed her artificial public persona, which she was never going to do without being cornered into it.)\n\nIt's true some kdramas portray women as incapable of rational thought in direct contrast to men, who can be both logical and ethical even in matters that concern them personally\u2014see the father in every family drama being the more liberal and understanding parent who is willing to accept a 'flawed' daughter-in-law for the sake of his child's happiness or to see his delinquent child punished by the law as part of a necessary process of moral rehabilitation or whatever, as opposed to the mother, who is always selfish, clannish, prejudiced, obsessed with appearances and childishly tyrannical\u2014but I don't think this drama is an example of that trend. There have been dramas about male protagonists that feature similar moments of total and public collapse; they just tend to be about cops or corporate tycoons or athletes rather than romance, so the exact mechanism of public humiliation is different.\n\nIn any case, I thought the portrayal of Deborah's downfall offered a commentary on a very topical gender issue in South Korea, namely the fully mainstreamed men's rights movement and the way any woman who expresses any sentiment that could be loosely interpreted as feminist is demonised by the public.\n\nThere was a South Korean archer who was recently 'smeared' as a feminist on the grounds that she wore her hair short (a feminist/lesbian tell, apparently) and had gone to a women's college (ditto). She didn't even say anything; people just piled on her because of her haircut. There was also a social media influencer who was cyberbullied and driven to suicide by her haters after making some remarks that were seen as feminist (and by extension misandrist, which is now the worst thing you can accuse a woman of being in South Korea).\n\nThe way Deborah's career took a massive hit because she said men are bastards and no one, not even most women, had any sympathy for her after she explained she'd recently been dumped, with her public apology only serving to invite more misogynistic attacks, struck me as a deliberate choice by the writer and director.\n\nEdit: As a final example of how extreme and absurd the collective sense of male grievance has become in South Korea, when Michelle Yeoh said something about how proud she was to be the first Asian woman to win an Oscar or how she\u2019s hoping to inspire young girls or whatever after her Oscar win, SBS, a national broadcaster, scrubbed all mentions of women/girls from both the Korean subtitles and the video of her speech itself! And then justified doctoring her words with the claim that anyone should feel inspired by Michelle Yeoh, not just women, and they felt their version of her speech was truer to what she had really meant to say.",

Her comment about being labelled someone who hated both men and women also pointed to the backlash women have seen for expressing any criticisms of men. In this case she criticised women too and was thoroughly abandoned. \n\nI didn't know about the Michael Yeoh incident (absolutely insane!) but have read about the rest. Even the simple act of saying that she read the book, Kim Ji-young, Born 1982 sparked a sustained MRA smear campaign against Red Velvet's Irene cause the book had started conversations about women's role in society amongst celebrities.\n\nThe drama is also making the clear point that when you hitch your career wagon to the success of your personal relationship, the downfall of the latter will have the former crumbling too. We see this happen irl whenever self proclaimed relationship gurus go through public divorces. This is why when Soo-hyuk asked in the beginning what her qualifications are to be a dating coach and if a divorce would count as disqualification, it felt like commentary as well as foreshadowing. \n\nSo, yeah, I agree that the drama has really thought through its themes. It's why I'm so invested in it.\n\nBut I want to come back to my point about depictions of women's loss of control vs men's in the aftermath of a break up in dramas. It's important to bring it up in the context of romance dramas since it has a much larger female viewership. I liked that the pd and writer let Soo-hyuk have his drunken grieving &amp; mourn his break up for several episodes (you usually don't see that, MLs only spend time thinking about their ex in terms of betrayals or vengeance). \n\nBut having Bora get drunk during work because of her heartbreak was a choice. \n\nWe can shrug it off by saying they had to do it to bring her to that stage and blow things up, but then we leave a conscious decision by the writer unexamined. \n\nIf you've watched this team's previous work, Mad For Each Other (really a great watch for the majority of its runtime), you might remember how the male lead was supposed to have anger management issues but past the first episode it was the female lead who was shown to have frequent emotional breakdowns. The fact was that she was traumatised and it was believable. But having the male lead conversely become perfectly calm the more the FL spiralled was, again, a choice. \n\nIf the writer and PDs of Bora! Deborah had both leads make public fools of themselves - except Deborah having a big audience faces the bigger backlash - I wouldn't be stuck on this point so much. \n\nBut Lee Soo-hyuk turns up the day after his breakup at work and no one except his friend has any idea what he's going through internally. \n\nThat they have Deborah go down flaming while Soo-hyuk becomes the sympathetic but calm rescuer says something about how the show sees a woman's reaction to heartbreak vs a man's. \n\nThe funny thing about sexism is that it doesn't limit itself to the writings of misogynistic people. It's all pervasive and we all exercise it. If we don't discuss it when we spot in the writing of a good show, we do ourselves a disservice as fans.",

                                    "comment": "I\u2019ve seen Mad for Each Other and didn\u2019t like it or the leads that much, but I think it was trying to portray the difference between how men and women\u2019s mental illness manifests and is treated by society rather than making essentialist claims about men and women\u2019s brains. It\u2019s a fact men in patriarchal societies are conditioned to suppress their emotions and taught that anger is one of the few they can express, while women are exposed to many cultural scripts about e. g. female neuroticism, \u2018crazy women\u2019 and the usefulness of crying/displaying weakness in public that translate to aggregate differences in behaviour. (For example, more women cry in public after their bosses dress them down than men; this is the result of centuries of patriarchy bearing down on us to shape how we interact with the world, but acknowledging this phenomenon is not by itself sexist.) Mental illness is socially constructed, so yeah, it\u2019s gendered. I don\u2019t know how successfully the drama made its point\u2014again, I didn\u2019t like it and had problems with it\u2014but being attentive to gender issues doesn\u2019t mean giving both leads the exact same problems for me.\n\nRe. Bora\u2019s meltdown, I agree SH swooping in to carry her out of the room was cringe and sexist. We\u2019re gonna see a lot more of that moving forward because this is a romcom and romcoms find it extremely hard to break out of positive gender stereotypes even when they\u2019re trying to be progressive.\n\nBut again, I don\u2019t think it matters that SH\u2019s breakdown didn\u2019t happen in public. I don\u2019t need to see that to allow BR\u2019s meltdown because I don\u2019t need BR and SH to have the exact same problems. And I don\u2019t think \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the exact same thing happen to a male protagonist in another drama\u201d is enough evidence the writer was pulling from some deep cultural reservoir of stereotypes about women\u2019s lack of emotional self-control. As I said, there have been plenty of dramas in which men self-destruct in public.\n\nWhat I did find worthy of an eye-roll was Bora taking all of episode 4 to get over an objectively terrible relationship, as well as her earlier self-delusion and obsession with getting married to a waste of space like Juhwan. Again, I do think the drama was trying to make a point about how women are conditioned to see marriage as the end goal of every relationship and a source of financial and social security, which is more important, they believe, than emotional intimacy or personality fit, blah blah blah yada yada. However, here at least I found the extent to which Bora was influenced by these attitudes to be unrealistic and offensive given how smart and worldly she\u2019s supposed to be\u2014in South Korea it\u2019s far more common for women NOT to want to get married because they\u2019d be expected to give up their careers and do all the housework for their families, serve their in-laws, be under the financial control of their husbands, etc. than for women to want marriage too much\u2014and I wish there was at least one female character in the drama explicitly pushing back on these ideas so we could see a more nuanced and interesting discussion of them.\n\nThe way the breakup hit Bora *did* play into longstanding kdrama clich\u00e9s about women expecting relationships to fix their whole lives and being completely emotionally destroyed by breakups. See Marriage, Not Dating and Another Miss Oh for two examples of this pattern out of, like, hundreds. So I did find the *reason* for her emotional breakdown to be sexist, yeah. But again, no, I didn\u2019t need SH to blow up his career in public like BR did to conclude her self-destructive behaviour in that particular scene was gender-neutral. (Also it doesn\u2019t really matter when the whole relationship and subsequent breakup are one big stereotype, as I said.)\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ll wrap it up here because I\u2019ve gone on too long. To summarise, I\u2019m perfectly well aware of the drama\u2019s inability to break out of a sexist and essentialising romantic paradigm \u00e0 la Battle of the Sexes, I think you\u2019ll find many more examples of it if you go looking for them, I don\u2019t agree Bora getting drunk and ranting in public was one of them, and in general I don\u2019t really mind the drama\u2019s stupid moments because I\u2019ve never seen a progressive romcom with perfect politics in my life nor do I need that to enjoy a story.",

It\u2019s only because he wasn\u2019t famous so that didn\u2019t hurt his career.\n\nMore over, Bora\u2019s career is based on the fact that \u201cshe knows about relationships\u201d, so her public image being ruined and career at stakes by her realizing she doesn\u2019t actually knows is the main plot line. Bora\u2019s growth is to be true to herself and her partner.\n\nWhile I didn\u2019t like how it went down in ep4, I do understand the intent of the writer. And the way the writer wrote about how she handled the situation was realistic. Bora not mentioning her ex cheated was actually very realistic. I don\u2019t think she did it out of the intent of \u201cprotecting him\u201d, it was more about her didn\u2019t want to go there. It will turn into an ugly fight and that doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s taking responsibility of her own actions. If the ex is playing dirty, she just doesn\u2019t want to participate and become one herself.",

I am excited for her growth to understanding what is actually important and that its not optics or games. \n\nHowever, Bora being a bad girlfriend doesn't justify her bf's cheating.  He was free to dump her or communicate what was making him unhappy. The scene at the end of ep 3 was hilarious and done so well - those poor garbage men who just wanted to do their jobs. \n\nI don't like how the publishing employees just ignore the CEO.\n\nBora's meltdown was a hard watch but makes sense. They want her to hit rock bottom so she can grow and make a comeback. \n\nI feel like someone who is running the party should've cut her off at the beginning of her rant but they just let her keep going.

I didn\u2019t expect it to dwell so long (and I expect ep 4 to bring more repercussions of their breakup). Not that I dislike it! I really appreciate the thought and care given to exploring the realities of relationship breakdowns (both FL and ex boyfriend as well as 2FL and husband). I don\u2019t even care that we had very little of ML because I think the show did the right thing by exploring the breakup in depth.\n\nOn Bo Ra and ex boyfriend \nNGL much of the episode was hard to watch precisely because it was so so realistic. The writer must have either gone through or thought deeply about long term relationships and marriages and how things fall apart. Bo Ra and ex boyfriend\u2019s scenes were devastating. I know people are screaming for ex boyfriend\u2019s head because his cheating and gaslighting is inexcusable but I thought it was very realistic and well done. Their silence, the hopes she had about ex coming back to apologise, hoping they could reconcile then realising the wounds run far deeper and realising the depth of the chasm between them was devastatingly real and true to life. Even their screaming match, where truth came out like jagged glass to pierce and cut and tear down, then going wildly off course (to the trash and garbage truck) was so realistic. I\u2019ve been in fights like that too, where you want to say so much but can\u2019t because of the depth of feelings and pain, and it just goes all crazy and you don\u2019t even know where you are anymore. (But I have never thrown myself on a garbage truck!) \n\nLast thing about Bo Ra - I see more drunken screaming shenanigans and I hope they don\u2019t drag it out too long. I\u2019m not a fan of people taking their personal issues out at what is essentially Bo Ra\u2019s work(the radio show, the upcoming La Belle event, even the livestream). \n\nOn 2FL and her husband. \nSeeing 2FL\u2019s pain and devastation from realising how far apart they were hurt coz I\u2019ve been there too. Marriages or long term relationships are hard. You drift and sometimes it\u2019s hard to come back. I hope they do, though. \n\n(side note: I didn\u2019t like how 2FL, upon being rejected for sex, kicked him off the bed - he had every right to not be in the mood!)\n\nOn Bo Mi \nYes she\u2019s entitled, irresponsible with money, sister\u2019s clothes etc. But deep inside she does love and care for her unni. I hope that over time she will mature and be a good support to her sister. \n\nOn the company boss \nI know he\u2019s supposed to be lighthearted foil but he\u2019s such a toxic boss - trying to change things to benefit staff but going ahead despite opposition. He\u2019s making it a dictatorship wrapped in benevolence. Hope he grows up. \n\nWhew. If you got to the end, thanks for listening!",

Maybe it's because I have a preference for strong female characters, but Bora's initial decision to excuse the cheating, and her friend's decision to stay with her husband despite him not being in the marriage took me completely out of it. Also, going into this drama I sort of had the initial expectation that Bora was a no-nonsense character with conviction, but she's way too wishy-washy as of now and it's putting me off the drama.\n\nNot saying I wanted them to have over-the-top reactions, but they're far too muted. I guess I'll only prefer these types of plotlines in revenge dramas where the female characters are presented as strong and independent, who have zero tolerance for this type of crap from the male characters.",

Have heard other shows by that writer are all good too, but I haven't watched them or much of them.  \n\n\nAlso this might be an unpopular opinion but I liked the (lightly fantasy based) drama Feel Good To Die which is about a time loop where female lead tries to prevent her boss from dying over and over again - I know it does not sound similar to realistic slice of life romance shows but it has a lot of realism in characterization and similarly 'flawed' characters who work to become better people over the course of the show. Especially the ML is very arrogant and annoying at the beginning but is eventually humanized quite a lot. It was sort of a 'butterfly effect' drama showing how people's unintentional actions affected the people around them in major ways. I'm not sure why the vibes of this show remind me of that one, they just do for some reason.  \n\n\nShows that are a bit more like 'comedies' but have similar messy interconnected character dynamics:  \nAge of Youth (all seasons)  \nBe Melodramatic  \nWork Later Drink Now (this one is a little over the top comedy-wise, but had its moments imo)  \n\n\nThose three were more about female friendships than about romance though.",

I think if you like those you are likely to like some of the ones on my list as well, and FWIW I think the reception to most of the above shows was very positive in general.  \n\n\nHope you enjoy at least some of them! I'll reply again if I remember anything else because I feel like there's some I missed. I agree with you that shows with kind of 'messy' extremely flawed but well-meaning characters are among my fav genres, there's just something more fun and dynamic about it imo when you can relate to the problems multiple characters have or they remind you of people you know rather than being extremely saintly, cool, or extremely evil etc. Even the brutal breakup in this show just felt so real because in my experience most people DO break up messily and embarrass themselves, I've been there and so have many of my friends, at least before they learn to have a bit more dignity about it.",

She maintains the relationship because it's part of her 'brand' and her self-image to be in a 'perfect relationship,' not because she is a mary-sue or caricature at all (there is nothing caricatured about the character imo, she's shown a lot of depth and her characterization seems very nuanced).\n\nThe characters you are describing are actual Mary-sues (their flaws are minor/negligible and unrealistic), and those are basically fantasy stories because real people don't behave like them (maybe except the Oh my Venus girl). I think those dramas are rated highly because they are self-insert fantasies, high budget with great cinematography and acting, set design, sound design etc. but the characters certainly aren't meant to be even remotely realistic as 'people.'  \n\n\nETA: not suggesting those are bad shows, but it's just a very different genre - this story is more about character realism and realism about social issues/society whereas most of those shows are essentially 'fantasy' shows.",

Her flaw is that she is a psychopath and spends most of her time abusing and manipulating other people, so it is a big one, but somehow she never ends up actually upsetting people for long with this behaviour and people all end up loving and appreciating her anyway. Somehow manages to form deep relationships despite being a psychopath.   \n\n\nGirl from CLOY: Perfectly beautiful chaebol who is also smart, has GUMPTION, is great at blending in and making her way in a situation where 99.99% of people would be immediately sniffed out and killed, escapes death endless times seemingly by magic, again 'perfect' men throw themselves at her and risk their lives for her all because she is just so gosh darn perfect, I'm not even sure what her 'flaw' is supposed to be.  \n\n\netc... the girl from OMV is a little more realistic as a character imo but again she's like an ultra nice, ultra beautiful young doctor who has mostly very positive social interactions.  \n\n\nYes it is strange (and concerning) that you know several abusive psychopaths and that you see this as an example of being a 'strong woman' when it is probably one of the most horrible if not the most horrible mental disorder(s) you can have. I'm just curious what 'world' are you from where almost everyone you know is an ultra-wealthy chaebol or doctor and many of them are psychopaths?

And the bestie's husband is such a goober, like why is someone as fantastic as her even with that guy? I don't know, if the idea is to get me to hate men the show is doing a good job of it (and yes the women are flawed but way less so than the men)",

He was selfish in his last relationship without realising it, took his partner for granted and didn't take her feelings seriously or acknowledge his own until it was too late, and now he's paying the price by being pathetically hung up on her and regretting his past behaviour. Sure, he didn't leave the viewers with a great first impression, but these are very common mistakes people make in relationships and, as I said, he's reaping what he sowed now.\n\nHe seems like a fundamentally decent guy\u2014despite his childish feud with Bora he was very quick to sympathise with her both times he saw her at a low point in her life, he takes his staff's side against his CEO friend when the friend's acting like a boomer, he insists on authenticity in both work and love, etc.\u2014so I'm genuinely curious why so many people seem to dislike him.",

What more redemption is really needed for being a bad/inconsistent boyfriend? He will probably learn from this.",

The drama presented him as this smug perfect guy who's got the important stuff in life all figured out and it validated his condescension to the FL by making her the stereotypical career-obsessed vapid city girl who needs to be taken down a peg, a characterisation that, other people told me, didn't really evolve much throughout the drama.\n\nHowever, in Bora! Deborah Soohyuk has shown enough flashes of contrition, irony and self-awareness so far to make me like him, while Bora herself is a charismatic character who does make good points/land good hits on him in their verbal spars, so their dynamic feels more two-sided and mutually vulnerable than in HCCC to me. They both have flaws, but they also both have things to teach each other, so the start of their relationship feels more Pride and Prejudice-y and less gratuitously confrontational /beholden to crude gender essentialism.\n\nThis is all my personal opinion, of course. I'm not saying your feelings as a viewer are wrong, just that I got a different impression.",

In that show it was obvious the ML didn't RESPECT the FL and had her worked up in his mind as a whole caricature. In this show I think even the early scenes with ML and FL it seems like there was some mutual professional respect beneath the spiky way they were talking to each other, he was self-aware to some degree about her advice on the show pinning him down and he did voluntarily read her books after that despite initially thinking she was a quack/scammer. Then once he saw her in a vulnerable position he was very gentle and kind with her, meaning he sees her as a human being first and foremost and he didn't choose her low moment to rub it in that she's a bad dating advice columnist or whatever, whereas in HomCha I think there were multiple scenes where he seemed to actively laugh at her misfortune (at the beginning, anyway).  \n\n\nI think this dynamic is much more similar to the other work of this writer, Mad For Each Other where the two leads started out really hating each other but eventually softened up to each other as their 'soft underbellies' started showing. It was a much more mutually confrontational vibe to begin with but one where you could see where both characters were coming from before they got to know each other.",

I also think he was so rude and condescending to her to begin with because some people just hate 'self help celebs' automatically (I don't always blame them) and didn't think he would actually have to face her in person/have her hear him saying rude things about her. Later I think it's because he was very internally defensive of his own terrible dating 'strategy' and didn't want to accept that he messed up  his own relationship so he blamed it on Bora's advice as a way of staying in denial.  \n\n\nI know what you mean about the male lead in HCCC but in that show it seemed way more egregious/random/mean to me and here it seems like he largely came off so awful to her because of a string of snowballing circumstances, and he would not normally be so mean and rude. In the last couple eps he's obviously been extremely sympathetic to her and also very respectful of her boundaries, and gone so far to worry about her consistently and stand up for her to his boss. I think this is meant to show that most of the initial rudeness was just kind of a face he put on for reasons unrelated to her as a person and he's already realized he shouldn't have acted like that (in fact, I think he would not have been so bad had he not been caught/overheard insulting her).",

Bo Ra's desperation might have felt a bit out of place, considering that Ju Hwan's actions went beyond simply breaking up with her, as he lied, cheated, and seemed unapologetic. Of course, it's only natural for Bo Ra to be heartbroken after the end of a 3-year relationship, but her reaction could have been portrayed differently.\r  \n\r  \nWhen Bo Ra overheard Ju Hwan's conversation with Yu Jung's husband, I hoped to see her stand up for herself, much like she did with Soo Hyuk during their business meeting. Instead, she focused on her appearance and clung to the hope that Ju Hwan would take her back. Her desperation may stem from a need to maintain her public image, but in that case, her downward spiral in episode 4 becomes a bit puzzling. Why jeopardize the career she's working so hard to preserve?\r  \n\r  \nI believe this development might have been more of a plot device to enable Bo Ra's personal growth and foster her relationship with Soo Hyuk rather than an utterly authentic reaction from her character. That being said, I remain optimistic and excited to see how Bo Ra's personal growth unfolds and how she evolves from a black-and-white mindset to embracing the complexities of life and love as a spectrum.",

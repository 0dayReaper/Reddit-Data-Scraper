It was so cute. \ud83d\ude2d I told him K-drama male leads do things like that for their girlfriends all the time, so he asked me for some ideas. I convinced him to watch The Glory. &gt;!Lol, just kidding. I promised to let him know some cool ideas.!&lt;  \n\nSo can you guys name a few dramas where the ML does something super thoughtful for his girlfriend? I\u2019ve been re-watching Flower of Evil, so the only idea I had was &gt;! looking for your serial killer father\u2019s accomplice!&lt;  but alas, that's not gonna work.",

Though I'm sure I missed a lot. I'm mostly into the basic stuff - checking in via text, bringing over food, spending quality time even if it's not a lot and showing healthy communication skills even when things are hard or easy to misunderstand.",

In Because This Is My First Life, a &gt;!snail that carries its home on its back!&lt;.\n\nSomeday I want to create a whole list/quiz of the cute, symbolic stuffed animals in Kdramas. Yes, I realize marketing the merch was probably the motivation as much as plot. But I'm kinda sad I missed the time period for buying &gt;!an official Oh My Venus sloth!&lt;!",

Usually I don't go for older dramas because I find that most of them do not age that well but this time I am making an exception and plan to have some fun with the experience.\n\nI've created my own game via the Viki comments section and Kim Tan is my subject.  It's called \"Kim Tan is.....\" and depending on what Kim Tan is doing in any given scene I might leave a (hopefully) entertaining or insightful comment.\n\nA few examples so far from the first episode:\n\nKim Tan is surfing\n\nKim Tan is intrigued (from when he first spots Eun Sang)\n\nKim Tan is inconvenienced (based on their bickering at the hospital after his friend snorts bean powder -lol!)\n\nKim Tan is a gentleman (from when he comes back to check on Eun Sang and asks her to stay at his place).\n\nThe opportunities for observation of our subject are limitless and I look forward to continuing on.  And this might be entertaining only to me but so far I'm enjoying myself!",

Sure the editing is dramatic and the way they always cut away from the most expected performances to show them at the end of the next episodes is maddening to me, but still I've grown so attached to all the boys and they're all so good. I can't tell you how many times I've cried with them when they're going through hard times or at their performances. \n\n&gt;!The performance of Home by Seventeen that they did was especially emotional to me of all the ones I've seen so far.\nAlso I was not a fan of kpop but I've started obsessively listening to Pentagon after listening to Hoe Taek sing in this show.!&lt;\n\nI saw that Viki has added two other similar shows so I'll definitely check them out once I'm caught up with Boys Planet",

My only (minor) complaint is that, as the competition has progressed, the groups have gotten coaching and choreography from professional coaches, and their performances are starting (for me) to look similar. I liked their initial performances better, where the individual style of the groups shone through more. Still rooting for my faves though. (#11, #23, and #7, Fighting!) I'd love to vote, but I can't figure out how. \ud83d\ude15",

I feel like 3R with the new songs feel like run-of-the-mill boy group performances. \n\n&gt; I'd love to vote, but I can't figure out how. \n\nI checked the [voting site](https://peaktime.jtbc.co.kr/peaktime/en/matching/second) but it needs sign up/sign in with an account which I couldn't be bothered to do.

My expectation is really low, and according to the comments in this sub, the drama is going to get worse. But it has been funny, with many absolutely laughable plots, like the FL that doesn't die... and she should have died about 3 times already. I think it's the first FL that I hope to die to  the drama to move forward. Also, the plot of  US invading North Korea. Like, wtf, why would US invade North Korea and do the SK job? \n\n**Oasis (4/16):** another drama about Korea, 1980s, which means that either the ending is pain, darkness and sadness, or it is political propaganda of the dictatorship. I hope this drama avoids these sad endings as much as possible. I tried to rewatch Youth of May and couldn't because of the heavy content. Snowdrop dropped 3 times, all before ep. 5. But Oasis has been okay...the plot with the gang seems interesting, and the theater give an art tone that serves its purpose. the SML and mother seem forced, and the ML father is poorly constructed, but the FL and ML seems to be doing a good job, so let's see how it turns out.",

It was also seen from miles away that she would attempt suicide eventually and get saved by the guy who likes her which she did not deserve imo. Was also annoying when everyone felt bad that they were 'too harsh' to her in the end. Would have largely preferred if she and her family got destroyed...other students have terrible parents and bad life situations and they don't go around intentionally ruining other people's lives. There are plenty of dramas where I end up hoping for a redemption arc or not terrible ending for the antagonists with sad backstories but this was not one of those times. Just had no tolerance or sympathy for her. Rant over!&lt;",

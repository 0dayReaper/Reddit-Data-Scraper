This is the themed post for all identification questions and requests, including dramas! \n\nBefore posting in this thread please take a look through our [discussion resources - who/what/which is this section](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/discussionresources#wiki_who.2Fwhat.2Fwhich_is_this.3F) which outlines ways in which you can work out many of these requests for yourself.\n\nYou can ask here for help identifying the following things: Dramas, Actors, Product  Placement (either product or brand), Drama Locations, Clothing,  Accessories, Music (OST or background).\n\nPlease  provide a picture if possible (upload on imgur) and include as much  contextual information as you know (e.g. source drama, broadcast year, episode number and time stamp, etc.).\n\nOnce you have found an answer please edit your original comment to state \"**SOLVED**\" in bold caps at the top so people don't spend time trying to help unnecessarily.\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

IIRC this was followed by a flashback to when they were kids in math class or something. Anyone know what it\u2019s from?",

This song was apparently stuck in her head and she tried to remember this hardly. It was a western famous/pop song from 70-80s maybe. Which drama and what song was that? \n\nI was thinking that the song was Tears in Heaven but most likely other song. This is just kind of something stuck in your head and you really want to figure out what it is...\n\nI was thinking this is from Awaken or Voice but still not 100% sure what it was...\n\nEDIT: Got another clue, this song was played in the FL/2nd FL when she was driving in the car and also while she was in her apartment/home",

The child ends up saying that the murderer is one of the members of the police.",

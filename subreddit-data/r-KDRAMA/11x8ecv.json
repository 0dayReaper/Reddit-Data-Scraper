That scene where Dong Ryun tells Jung Hwan mums like to feel they are needed, I have to concur with that. The life lessons from this drama keep on giving.\n\nI was on some long flights so I watched a few movies. I rewatched Prisoner of Azkaban. I watched a Korean movie called **Ditto**. It had a slow start but it got better from mid point onwards. Enjoyed it. I was more drawn to the characters of Eun Sang and Yong ji than the ML. I might be biased though because I like the actors portraying these roles. And I really liked Kim Munee; both her character and the actor playing her. I kinda thought it was an older movie ( maybe 3-4 years old) but it actually came out last year. 8/10.\n\nI also watched a Chinese movie called **Love Can't Be Said**. Despite the name of the film, it was thoroughly enjoyable. Such an adorable little film. Loved both the lead characters and actors. Highly recommend if you like youth dramas/movies. 9/10.",

I distinctly recall falling asleep while watching the original film on VHS rental back in 1986/87, which was no reflection of the film's quality, but merely due to my tender age at the time. \n\nI felt that the sequel paid tribute to the original without lapsing into becoming a mere homage of it. For example, while Harold Faltermeyer's iconic score set the tone in the opening scene, the film went its own way from there. It made clear that in the age of automated fighter jets, even pilots who are \"the best of the best\" like Maverick, are a dying breed. I also felt that Miles Teller was able to embody the spirit of portraying Goose's son, without falling into a parody of that iconic character.",

Like &gt;!we have no background of this character being religious, but now she's confessing in a church? Why? Well because we need her to meet Choi Jin Hyuk's character!&lt;. Or &gt;!we're in a prenatal class, now we're being sad in a cafe, now we're painting signs and coffee mugs because I guess this guy has a business he's opening up!&lt;.

We all know that you are the wrong choice! \n\nTo be fair, at least he is consistent. \n\n&gt;!The king was a complete douche to the Queen when she opened up to him, but, as soon as she starts pushing him away, he starts gaining interest in her. It is also kind of suspicious how fast he falls out of love with the noble consort. That is at the moment when the noble consort becomes the safest option because the Queen is at risk of losing her title.!&lt; It is possible to argue that the king always chases after the forbidden fruit. \n\nIdk, maybe I have a point or maybe I am just being too harsh on the ML because I have a soft spot for the toxic SML.",

I will probably try to finish the ones i have on hold instead of watching a new one, i hate not finishing shows. I'm glad i only picked great shows so far, so didn't have to drop anything because it was bad.",

Anything new worth watching that is a rom-com or has a great romance subplot?  I couldn't get into \"Crash course in romance\" as I felt like there was no romance, and I didn't enjoy the school/grades drama.",

A new kdrama will help the time go by faster.",

That's the only one I can think of off the top of my head though.)",

It's also an ensemble cast so it's not a traditional ML/FL pair led type of story.",

It\u2019s funny because I know it\u2019s not great or anything, but it\u2019s solid enough for me to enjoy and binge. So last episode sucks? It hasn\u2019t been spoiled for me yet, but I saw some others mention the bad ending.\n\nThe skinship was done pretty well too. I remember that scene in business proposal where they\u2019re making out and &gt;!he lifts her on the table.!&lt; it was so awkward and not sexy. The make out scenes here were definitely believable.",

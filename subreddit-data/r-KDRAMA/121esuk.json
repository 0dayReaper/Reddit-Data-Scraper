I feel like each episode is slow and deliberate, with some \u201cfiller\u201d that I don\u2019t really mind because I think it helps provide additional character substance, building and progression. \n\nI think it\u2019s because this drama has a very \u201cslice of Life\u201d feel to it but integrated with some \u201cmonster of the week\u201d aspects. The storyline weaving reminds me of Extraordinary Woo, and the pacing of the story reminds me of Run On (which makes sense given the director).\n\nI also like that none of these characters fit neatly into any typical archetype boxes. They feel like real  people, and I applaud the cast, writing and directors for that. The trio bromance is also fantastic so far, and I enjoy the growing sisterhood between the two FL\u2019s. \n\nOverall I\u2019m really enjoying this so far and interested to see how it ends. I love dramas that show and don\u2019t tell, and I feel like the ML of this drama is a perfect example of that (again - he feels like a real person, not an actor playing a role).  \n\nOne thing that stood out to me was the ML &gt;!talking about how he was not that close with his sister. Sibling relationships are like this sometimes. You\u2019re close but not really close. Yet you have every reason to be close but you\u2019re just\u2026 not. And now the opportunity will never come, and you wonder if things would\u2019ve been different if you had just bridged that gap. If you had taken the time instead of only focusing on yourself. I just get it. I get his reasoning why he\u2019s doing what he\u2019s doing. He loved his sister, they weren\u2019t close, but she still deserves Justice and he wants to give that to her.!&lt; \n\nIt looks like the end of the series will be a big deal with &gt;!the mother in law getting a divorce.!&lt; I do wonder if the &gt;!stepmom will get her comeuppance at all or if the \u201cgood\u201d ending will just be her losing Gi-yeong which honestly would be ideal since she clearly doesn\u2019t care for him.!&lt;",

The drama is not \u201cdramatic\u201d yet it is by way of it\u2019s subtlety. The \u201cfiller\u201d seems to be backstory that is detailed and often times pertinent in later episodes, and other times it adds charm to the characters. Their typical \u201ctropes\u201d and similar plots are absent here- hence the mental refreshment for me. In general/ K dramas are apolitical and don\u2019t overly focus on sex/ relationships so I have gravitated towards them of late. I guess I prefer character and plot contexts over romance \ud83e\udd23.",

Hyung Geun was using the brooding staring-out-the-window photo from an earlier episode, the one that made him \"look tall.\" Jung Shik's was a headshot with what I think is called a manggeon - that traditional mesh headband - and a topknot. Since there's no reason for him to have been dressed like that in this drama, I'm wondering if it's a sly reference to the actor's leading role in the costume drama Haechi (2019). Or perhaps his role in Six Flying Dragons (2015)?",

Not sure I can explain why I like it.  \n\nIt has, so far, none of the usual tropes.  \n\nAll the characters are interesting so far.  There are no side stories that are boring or seem unimportant to the plot.  The show introduces us to a case every two episodes or so, and as usual for that genre, the cases serve to make a point.\n\nThere is no main romance so far and I don't think there will be one.  Freed from this burden, the drama feels more cohesive, as if it's not trying to pull in different directions.\n\nInstead of a romance, we have an absolutely wonderful and uncomplicated bromance of three childhood friends who deeply care for each other.  They mostly use this relationship to lighten the mood, which otherwise might be a bit grim.\n\nWhat I love about bromances, is that I don't need to worry about the unavoidable breakup somewhere near the end of the series, which all dramas seem to feel compelled to do.\n\nOne of the things that I appreciate is that the show assumes the viewers are intelligent and do not need to be hit over the head about each plot point, or reminded of what happened 15 minutes ago in flashbacks.",

It surprises me how often American pop culture or past culture is referenced in these current programs. As an aside- I do gravitate towards plots where the underdog tends to be victorious. So I\u2019m hoping that will be the case here. I also sense a character full of respect of all walks of life- in Attorney Shin. This is something that not all leads tend to demonstrate.",

It randomly appeared as a suggestion, I assume because I am watching this drama.  I am really enjoying it so far, and it has displaced other dramas I had been watching.    It's not dissimilar to Attorney Shin in the theme, but very different in the tone.  In Lawless lawyer, the ML is a kick-ass gangster-turned-lawyer.  It's a revenge-type drama.  He seeks to bring down a town filled to the brim with corruption at all levels.  They were responsible for the murder of his mother.  \n\nIt's not smart and subtle, but I'm enjoying it.  I like the ML's unusual looks. He makes me think of an elfin Korean. I believe he was in Flower of Evil.  The FL was in It's Okay not to be Okay.  It's a good pairing.  There are hints that there might be a romance eventually.  The ML seems to care for her already a great deal, due to the usual past connection, which I won't reveal, not to spoil it.  She, on the other hand, does not like him, but I think he is quickly growing on her.",

Anyone caught the part when the group were discussing how to promote Shin and he tried to nudge SJ but she saw it coming and lifted her hand to avoid it? A very subtle way to show how comfortable and familiar they are with each other now.\n\n2. The noodle shop scene has got to be my fav. First to see the 3 of them together shows how they have welcomed Choi into the group.\n\n3. When Choi was waxing lyrical about Shin\u2019s piano performance, GH slightly leaned back, allowing Shin to shove the pickle inside Choi\u2019s mouth. Small actions like this show how tight their bromance is and that they can anticipate each other\u2019s actions.\n\n4. Love the part when Shin wanted to leave and the noodle show lady asked \u2018aren\u2019t you gonna finish this?\u2019 And he straightaway sat back down. Such a smooth and natural action. Also shows how much respect they are giving her as well, given that in the first place they were suspecting if she can cook as well as her mother. \n\n5. And not forgetting when she was trying to bring up the piano piece\u2019s name, GH was the one correcting her. Like he knew exactly when she was trying to say, how well he knew her already. \n\n6. I\u2019m really glad that the MIL looks to be a positive character despite her cold exterior, and is helping Shin and GY spend time together. When YJ called her to inform that she\u2019s picking up GY, I can only guess she\u2019s in the spa and didn\u2019t not pick up the call and YJ only left a voicemail. Can\u2019t imagine MIL allowing YJ to pick up GY!\n\n7. Also interesting to see JS\u2019 reaction to Park. He immediately lent his car and even volunteered and drove to Haenam with GH just to help to crush Park. \n\nReally their bromance is too good to be true! Love it!",

I love his role of completely transparent double-agent. He tells both sides everything.  \n\nHis face when Noodle lady tells Shin about her mother's reaction ...\n\nHis accurate description of the piece that Shan played ... I sensed a deep melancholy from your street performance.  Some deep dark anger, some deep-rooted sorrow ... his lovely and accurate description is interrupted by Shin stuffing his mouth with food.  He has an ear for music, clearly.\n\n*How did Park Yu-seok look?  Like a cotton swab with half the cotton missing*... lol.  \n\nI just loved that whole scene.  The faces of the boys.  The way that Shin tries to escape and abruptly sits back down after a sharp \"Aren't you going to finish that?\"\n\nDo they use the same preacher's voice for all dramas? In that scene where they are in church, the voice sounded a lot like other dramas I saw that had a preacher's voice.    \n\nI can't wait to find out what Attorney Park did that caused Jung Shik to hate him so much and for Attorney Shen to call him a fraudster and con artist.  My theory was that he was bought off by the other side, and acted against his client, but they can't prove it.\n\nLoving the grandmother more and more each episode. &gt;!But I hope she is not rejecting her granddaughter because she hates her mother.  Hopefully, it's just that she couldn't take her along because her plan was to give her grandson some alone time with his uncle. But you could tell that the evil stepmom took it as a snub.!&lt;  If it wasn't for the fact that the kids would be upset, I am wishing for a piano to fall on her head.\n\nLooks like the case won't wrap up this episode.  &gt;!What will the fact that the baby is not his son change?  And how will it help him regain his honour?  Will public opinion turn in his favour? To my western eyes, the fact that he is accused of beating her seems the worse offence.  Although we know that he didn't actually hit her.  So either she is faking the injury or someone else hit her.  But we aren't getting any hints about how this will be resolved in the preview.!&lt;\n\nAnother strong episode.  Can't wait for next weekend.",

There's affection, caring, teasing, harassing - all the things friends do to each other. \n\nMa Geum-Hee is a force to be reckoned with and I don't think her daughter-in-law understands that.

I doubt he would go, I think he really likes work with Shin and at that office.!&lt;\n\nI don't have a good vibe on the Jo Min-Jeong case - &gt;!clearly her hubby is a bit shady (lying about his niece being his daughter - wtf).

It could either be that she's just happy for him... Or maybe she liked what she saw \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33 (pls let me ship them, ik nothing will happen)\n\nI like how supportive and caring all the characters are. Obviously the sad ahjussis are always on call whenever someone is going through something, but the noodle shop lady is the MVP. I love how she comforts first Honggeun and now Seojin when she's going through a rough patch. Just a really good friend. \n\nAlso *everyone* at the Sunghan's office has a strong but quiet bond. Did anyone else notice how Saebom just slid some orange into Honggeun's mouth? And they're always joking and playing around. It'd a big difference from how cold and sterile the antagonists' firm is.\n\nSpeaking of the antagonists, God, I want Sunghan to wipe that smug smile off evil Stepmom and her henchman's faces so badly. And it's be so cool if the sister's ex-MIL also joined up with Sunghan. Hopefully this Vietnamese immigrant case will achieve both of these...\n\nEP. 8: I feel like a lot of things happened but also nothing did. The previews promised a big confrontation and comeuppance... but nothing of the sort came to pass. It felt like a very half hearted, cursory examination of what happened in the village on the part of the show. And tbh I don't really like the main case, it feels very gross towards immigrants, esp considering how immigrants, women and immigrant women are treated in SK already.\n\nHopefully, next week, we'll see how Sunghan actually take on evil Stepmom and her loyal dog. As usual, evil Stepmom made my blood boil. Fingers crossed, the ex MIL does team up with Sunghan, she seems to have atleast some morals.\n\nIt's cool that Seo-jin's character development do be happening and the case with the schizophrenic lady is progressing. I wish that got more time spent on it, it felt more interesting imo. We honestly barely got more than a brief sketch of what that awful man was going to his wife.\n\nObviously Shunghan was being a bit obnoxious, but why did everyone laugh at the idea of him being a hottie lol? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d \"You know you're not that hot right?\" \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 Are we talking about the same man??\n\nalso who is noodle shop lady crushing on? sometimes I feel like it's Sunghan, but PV seems to show divorced ahjussi?",

The thing is, nationality comes first and any media would prioritize their own countries and try to show them in a good light. After all, entertainment falls under soft power too. \n\nThe plot isn't uncommon either. A lot of immigrants marry other nationals mainly as an option to escape and make their lives better. \n\nAnyway, the drama could have used the same case without involving immigrants. So I agree with you. \n\n&gt;Are we talking about the same man??\n\nHaha maybe we are talking about Cho seung woo xD",

When I watched the episode I felt like the husband and wife were both vulnerable. He fell in love with a younger woman he pitied with regards to her life in Vietnam, and she was suffering also from her life. My lens will be different as not only am I American- I am a native South Floridian- raised in a very culturally diverse environment. So it makes sense I would interpret with my lens- and I also appreciate your comment as it opened my eyes to something I wouldn\u2019t have seen/ considered. I guess I felt that the Wicked step mom attorney led the Vietnamese woman into making false claims, as she planned and wanted the social media backlash- hence  why she gave the husband who wanted to \u201cfix\u201d the marriage Attorney Shin\u2019s card.

Immigrants are quite resilient, smart, and well aware of what they are sacrifying for a better life. Despite the immense difficulties, it would be wrong to assume that they are naturally oppressed. \n\nThat being said, I still wish immigrants are portrayed differently.

It's very unclear what the role of FL is? There's no growth for her here although I like how the noodle shop owner and her are bonding.\n\nWhile the slice of life moments are brilliant, the whole family conflict is SLOW. VERY SLOW.

Procedure or end result isn't the important thing here but the causes and effects are, as a subtle commentary on divorce. \n\nMaybe literary fiction isn't your type or maybe you could try to adjust your expectations.",

In this week's eps, it just slid to a lot of drama and it felt very messy to me. Eps 5 &amp; 6 were also good if I think about it again - some amount of law, some amount of story unravelling, good amounts of slice of life!",

This appears to be an improved attempt on Thirty-Nine, another semi slice of life, light hearted melodrama on singlehood. \n\nThirty-nine's lead cast, however, was female, and it had the same kind of strong friendship theme going on for it - except that the true lead was Jeon Mi Do, and not Son Ye Jin. \n\nSo Shin takes on cases that matter to him,  but that's not what his life is all about. He listens to trot, goes glamping with the guys, and loves his nephew, his only remaining family. He's got more than the law.\n\nBased on the back stories I get the sense that maybe they built it up to be maybe more than 12 eps, and then they scaled it back. We have a back story for Kim Sung Kyun (the paralegal), but not Jung Sung Moon (the realtor). We also don't know too much about Shin's piano OR law background. \n\nThe female lead is an enigmatic character. Perhaps she's meant to portray someone who survives past divorce, adultery, and getting canceled. This part of the show was a hard sell for me, but I get the intention.\n\nIt's also dragging its feet on the sister's story, I give you that. I'm waiting to learn more about why Shin changed his entire life's path for her.",

Most of these older men marrying young foreigners, rarely are based on good intentions of the men, and the women are most likely to be victims of abuse. Reversing it and making the older Korean man the victim is wrong. \nI think it is more about the anti feminism and looking down of Vietnamese women. The old farmer is not a sympathetic character to me. \n\nI never trust Kdrama depictions of non Koreans. The actresses playing the role is likely Korean.",

And then some of them end up dragging their entire villager\u2019s and their problems to the foreign men they marry.",

That is a horrible and prejudiced characterization. \nMost men who go abroad specifically for finding a wife, whether it is Korean men going to Vietnam or American men going to Russia, are going because they are not a \u201ccatch\u201d in their own country, could be because of age, class, income, looks or a host of reasons in their own country with local women. \nIn addition, these men want a relationship where they have all the power and can control the women financially, physically and sexually. \nThese men are mostly misogynistic, patriarchal and abusive, they likelyhood of them being victims is low.",

By comparison, about 29% of South Korean women surveyed by the country's Ministry of Gender Equality and Family last year said they were victims of domestic violence -- again including a range of forms of abuse.\u201d",

            "comment": "I have to admit I started watching this show with controlled enthusiasm; I love Cho Seung Woo I\u2019m a fan, I do believe he\u2019s the best Korean actor and one of the best in the world (and I\u2019m bitter about the fact that I won\u2019t be seeing him as a the Phantom of the Opera now) but his last drama was such a disappointment for me that i decided to take things slow with this new show, even if the plot and the cast were promising.\n\nI felt the first episodes were as bit all over the place though still very funny and interesting but it isn\u2019t until these last two episodes that I can say publicly: I\u2019m liking it a lot. The friendship between the three guys is just fantastic, the middle age-ness is played so superbly! And the three have such different personalities! All the cast give detailed acting and it\u2019s so life-like that I can\u2019t help but rewatch certain parts.particularly the singing bits, I laughed a lot with the impromptu singing session between los tres amigos, the Brother Tes part (some of us have done the dancing and acting the song when working, admit it) and absolutely love SSH singing Heartless Blues\u2026actually for a couple of seconds there I think CSW forgot he was supposed to sing horribly out of tune.\n\nNow, honestly the personal drama of SSH definitely started to looked up when the MIL came into play. Also, I\u2019m just liking the FL a lot, I appreciate that her story wasn\u2019t forgotten as soon as her divorce was finished and that her character is being well developed\u2026 I DEFINITELY wouldn\u2019t mind if at the end of this drama the leads would consider to date each other, I think they have potential and chemistry and there has been lingering looks and details between them that I would be surprised if that happened.\n\nI also like that the people SSH ends up representing are usually the ones who, in the eyes of others, would be most at fault for their divorce (the cheating wife, the aggressive daughter in law, the cheating man who needs a transplant, the old man who \u201cbuys\u201d an immigrant woman) and isn\u2019t apologetic about their faults but rather offers a different side of things. I\u2019m very interested in the way this last case will be solved. \n\nMy main problem with the show is that it feels that it takes it sweet time to set up the cases and they end up being solved almost in a flash and not exactly by legal strategies. That and the SSH\u2019s ex brother in law and his new wife, they just seem like empty people and I would have liked a bit more development there.\n\nAlso I find it so fascinating that some people think the first two episodes were fantastic while others think there were lukewarm at best. Such different POV\u2019s!\n\nI can\u2019t wait for this weekend episodes! And I want to know the previous Ramyeon House owner!",

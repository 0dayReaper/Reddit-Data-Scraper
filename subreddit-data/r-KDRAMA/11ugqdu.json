Cho Seung Woo is once again convincing as a super-perceptive person and skilled lawyer (was so great in Stranger). And I like how elliptical his comments are, kind of looping around from the side so it takes a while for characters (and for me) to digest.\n\nAnd the three friends are so charming together - \"you look so tall\" \"give me your number.\" I like the light touch when it comes to decision making, too, like when Jung Sik (edited - wrong character, I meant Hyeong Geun) says in passing he'll need a picture, it's a very light way to show he's reached a difficult conclusion.",

Turns out one of the directors worked on Run On and the mother in law was the mom of ML in Run On.\nI'm enjoying this drama a lot, it has a subtlety that I don't think is instantly appealing to an audience looking for a flashier/more gripping story. The characters are all well developed and it's moving along nicely so I'm interested in what will happen to each person. It's also funny in a quiet way, the bromance trio and new confused lawyer are keeping a lighter tone which balances the heavier and sadder topics.\nCan't believe we're already halfway done.",

This isn't a show that assumes the viewers have the attention span of an ADHD goldfish and constantly uses flashbacks from something that happened 10 minutes ago.\n\nI keep loving the bromance. In some ways, I like it more than romances.  Dramas always feel compelled to torture the viewer when there is a romance; interrupted kisses, misunderstanding, noble idiots and the obligatory penultimate episode breakup.  Not so in a bromance.  Just 3 people sharing a lifelong, uncomplicated, friendship.  And now\n\nI noticed and appreciate that the comedy, in this drama, seems to be focused mainly on the bromance.  I think it makes the tone more consistent, allowing moments of humour intermingled with, as you said, heavier topics.  I've watched other dramas where the show is very funny in the first half and then turns more serious in the second, which makes the drama feel a little disjointed.  I think this works better because it's more consistent.\n\nCrash Course in Romance was like that.  The first part was cute and funny and then it turned pretty dark later on.",

The pacing is really good, I'm not bored or checking how much time is left and I feel ready for the next episode/want to know what's going to happen. \n\nYou're right about the bromance being more enjoyable than a romance. These three men are completely believable as lifelong friends, they seem so natural together. I am curious what the cast got up to before filming because it seems like more than lucky casting and good acting, it feels like they have a genuine bond.\n\nHere's hoping the comedy mixed in is consistent the whole way through. We're already halfway done, so I really don't want the tone to shift dramatically. I need the random karaoke sessions, home shopping network crabs and emotional support stalking!",

As usual, the relationship between Shin, Hyeong-Geun and Jeong-Sik is amazing. &gt;!I love how they hung around the office while Ms. Ma was meeting with Shin just to see if he was okay afterwards and then how they magically show up at the cafe after Hyeong-Geun gave his wife (soon to be ex) the divorce papers. !&lt;\n\nCan not &gt;!get over Jun blurting out that he's spying KeumHwa law office.!&lt; He was hilarious while camping ... although their idea of camping and my idea of camping are two very different things.",

Regarding Hye-Jin- idk why the editing is such that we spend a lottttt of time looking at Hye-Jin's face while she's just blank and isn't saying anything. I'm not sure if they are trying to convey some message from her expressions that I'm not getting, or the show runs slow entirely that's why, but that character isn't giving me anything tbh. Seeing her zeal during the first 2 episodes, and they way she advocated to get this job by putting together the door made me think her character will be interesting, but since then it's just shots of her face, doing nothing. Would like to see more from her if she's gonna be a lead character of the show!\n\nThe music chosen in this series is heckin amazing!

My guess is that maybe they won't. I don't know enough about the law in Korea, but if that recording becomes publicly available evidence, it would damage her as much or more than the Professor getting a criminal record. It would be a fun court case but maybe outside of what the show wants to tell.\n\nAnyway, the point of cancelling the insurance was to force her to expose herself.

            "comment": "**Episode 6**\n\nSo heartbreaking.  His family is all gone. And his nephew, who is the last of his family is being kept apart from him, making this more heartbreaking. No wonder he is willing to do what it takes to keep him in his life.\n\nThat scene with Ju-Hwa's MIL made me tear up for some reason.  The repressed grief on his face. He acted the hell out of that.\n\nThe resolution to the case of the week was &lt;chef kiss&gt;  Loved it.  Wonder if we will see the kid again.  I am really liking that most cases aren't even going to court but are solved through mediation.  I am really enjoying them, they are interesting.\n\nThe story with his nephew's stepmom is getting more mysterious.  &gt;!She was the last person to speak to Ju-Hwa?  Why was the number de-activated and re-activated? Is this the \"bait\" she referred to?!&lt;\n\nI really like that Shin isn't just helping out Seo-Jin but trying to rebuild her confidence in herself.\n\nThat new attorney is so cute, he's like a puppy.   Just love the casualness of Jo Jung Shik sitting on his lap.  I never get tired of this casual skinship Koreans display.\n\nWow, Seo-Jin son just showed up at her office by himself?  Is that the typical sort of autonomy allowed to Korean children? I noticed in kdramas kids seem to have more freedom to wander around. That's very different from the current culture in the West. In the West, the mother would have lost custody for this offence alone.  (not saying this is a good thing, it's rather over-the-top)\n\nCan't say enough good things about the bromance.  I wish I had such supportive friends.  It's not 35-year Whiskey it's fish sauce lol.  Haha. You need to hide your stash better next time.\n\nStill trying to puzzle out the significance of the grape.  I thought he was tracking his cases, in an attempt to get sufficient experience to win the one that is most important to him.  The one that involved his nephew.  But I couldn't interpret what was going through his head in the last scene, which followed the comment he made when Seo-Jin asked.  I appreciate the hell out of a drama that doesn't spell it out for you though.  Sometimes I feel like dramas treat us like AHDH gold fishes.",

Like if the divorce is done in good faith or for selfish reasons. \n\nSsh contemplating to color professor's grape can mean two things. He wasn't really satisfied with their case as he said they were like moths dancing to fire. \n\nOr he was thinking/mentally preparing himself about the next step of completing the grapes, as the next mission is emotionally difficult. I think it's the later, it took him a whole day to reach a decision to color the grape and the involvement of the MIL and step mom could have cleared whatever confusion he was having.",

Embarrassed to call the ambulance but was so shameless to involve her ex in her child birth. Woah. \n\nThe impromptu photo session was a smooth diversion. It put a closure to the issue in a the most random, awkward and fun way. Hope the noodle shop lady likes his new profile picture. I envy their friendship. \n\nThe flower incident made me appreciate Han hye Jin's acting. So far, her acting felt off and tbh a bit forced, but actually she (Lee seo Jin) has been really 'acting' to be tough and unbothered. I have been in her place, trying to hide my emotions and pretending to be perfectly normal, so yes, she (Han hye Jin) is doing a really good job. \n\nI really, really liked the conversation scenes with her and ssh.

Korean culture puts crazy pressure on pop icons to act socially 'proper'. Her pop identity is now defined by her affair as evidenced by the single job offer for a new gig being a racy sex talk show. \n\nI don't get the impression that an office assistant was her first choice for a job either. She tried calling a contact in her industry and was turned down. She is just desperate to get any sort of job as a condition to keep her kid. The legal office was a last resort where she wouldn't immediately get labeled as the controversial pop star that had an affair.",

            "comment": "**Episode 9:** I was *totally* wrong about the handsome doctor! How creepy. Here's my theory: he's targeting people with happy/loving familial relationships, because he didn't have them, but had an abusive grandfather instead. That's why he has photos of their loved ones grieving after they die - he can see their pain; they're without loving family now, as he was. Thus, Seo Yong Min and his mother, Kang Ji Hyeon and her father, her friend and her husband and soon-to-be child, and now the taxi driver who cares so much about her mother and was on a show about it. (Haven't quite finished the episode).\n\nArgh! I so believed he was a good guy. \ud83d\ude1e",

So it had more explicit action scenes. It had kind of a Mission Impossible feel to it with all the team members doing their parts to get revenge on behalf of their customers. They tackled some really horrendous crimes that were not handled properly by the law. Season 2 still has the teamwork, but the cases are more scams that could happen to the general public. (The stories in both are taken from real life practices.) It is rated 15 years. There is not as much violence, which is fine with me and I prefer their approach now as to what they do with the people they take revenge on. Lee Je Hoon does a great job in both seasons of taking on different disguises, personas for each case. Love the found family feelings of the team.",

            "comment": "I'm still into this drama but I miss the goofiness and humour of the early episodes, esp now that it's become a straight crime mystery story ft. ghosts. Plus, like the dramabeans reviewer pointed out, the characters are getting to the truth so slowly while we, the audience, already know everything.\n\nAlso, I'm sorry, but I'm not really a big fan of the romance, which is rare for me. Like, I'm all for noona romances, but there's still no chemistry between them at all, no matter how swoony Chanyoung is and how sweet his lines are; it feels really forced. Shoutout to the kiss scene last week tho... Bro really smooched the air. Imagine if anyone walked by at that time... \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nEp. 9: I'm ngl, I struggled to watch to the very end, and I could only power through because my friend told me there'd be major revelations. Too bad I literally knew the main villains like 6 episodes ago (as I'm sure everyone else did) T-T but credit where credit's due, at least one of my complaints were addressed - the characters are finally close to figuring out the true killer and the accomplice. &gt;!So if i'm understanding this right, the doctor does the killing - lemme guess, all the childhood trauma made him into a sadistic psycho or he always was one - and the nurse covers it up for him... probably because she killed his abusive grandma and he's been holding it over her ever since. !&lt;\n\nWhat I'm confused about - either bc it's been too long since it was mentioned or they didn't do a good job of explaining - what was the sequence of events the day Youngmin's mom died and &gt;! Hye-jin supposedly did!&lt;. So I know that the mom was killed in a hit and run by the mysterious biker dude but apparently Hye-jin &gt;!was picked up the biker and thrown in front of someone's house? was she hit over the head or something prior? !&lt; was this ever explained and I just forgot? I'm so lost.\n\nalso, I hope they elaborate about the red herring nurse's sister and her drug addiction. my theory was that he stole all those drugs for her, thus making him a scapegoat for the villain. I guess it's not that important, but I'd like more info on that, for my own satisfaction lol.\n\nChanyoung is back with those swoony, romantic lines but this ship just ain't floating, sir. try as hard as you or that amazing OST song during the credits might.\n\nEP. 10: yeah, I struggled again to finish the episode and I even did some FFing. I don't really have that much to comment. Before, the drama had a lot of humour and playfulness, that made it fun to watch but now it's all grim and serious. Ik the murder mystery was always a core part, but there was a nice balance imo with the lighter side. I'm also checked out since this kinda mystery plot has been done better in countless other shows. The evil pyscho, &gt;! the handsome medical professional being a murderer !&lt;, the red herrings, the diabolical monologues and the scene where heroes are on the verge of dying, etc. etc.\n\nIn terms of positives, I'm glad we finally have a clear timeline of what happened that day, since I was very confused on that score. Also the OST is so beautiful and effective. The acting by the ML and SML is also extremely good.\n\nI'm sorry but I will keep harping on this bc it struck a chord with my broke ass. we've seen how much poverty sucks in this drama countless times lol. Poor man had to give up on his dreams because of debt and he even lost his father to the damned loan payments. No wonder he's so sensitive about money. Meanwhile, this super privileged cop just mocks him for being a money grubbing, miserly Grinch with 0 apology. My fav scene of this was when last EP. he told her his sad backstory and she was just like \"damn that sucks bro \ud83d\ude42\" &amp; moved on to another topic \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80",

I think that was it a fail on the writer's part to try to integrate a \"normal\" romance with all the usual tropes into the first few episodes.  Better just to show that they care for each other, like for example that time he was willing to take a hit from a baseball bat rather than see the phone destroyed.  That's enough.  I would have rather had the show hint that, had she not been a ghost, there could be a romance.",

IMO, the ML only has that one expression on his face. And from long ago watching dramas, I really hate characters that don't have peripheral vision or always take forever to ask \"what do you mean\" before moving their eyes/head to whatever the commotion is and then missed the whole thing.\n\nAnd are apartments in Korea really sound-proof that when people talk right in front the door, you can't hear it from the inside? Why would you yell \"Ms. Ji Hyeon\" right there and then?\n\nI am glad it's only one more week to go.",

So I'm assuming that her death was faked to get her out of there, and for that to happen, he needed help from someone in the hospital.  At the very least the paperwork needed to be done by someone who was authorized to do that.  It wouldn't be too hard to declare her dead, wheel her off in a gurney only to disappear into an ambulance. Much easier than having her actually die convincingly enough that the psychopath doctor is satisfied.  So I think that's the most likely scenario.  But if that's correct, then who is that person?\n\nBut whatever scenario it is, it means that her father suspected something was amiss in that hospital.  And if he did, why was he not involving the other detectives who seemed ignorant that something wasn't right?  Did he go ultra-paranoid and suspected everyone?",

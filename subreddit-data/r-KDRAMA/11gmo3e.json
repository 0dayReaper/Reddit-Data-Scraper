    "postText": "I'll start first with things I liked\n\nI like the fact that it's a show where all the main characters are villainous to some degree ranging from Anti-hero to downright scum, it's not black and white about morality it reflects real life really well. I also love the message, the sad fact that the justice system doesn't punish rich people very well, rich people get away with a lot and the justice system is inherently flawed, people can get framed for things, prosecutors and judges can be bought. \nThe last episode was also very satisfying for me, the two main villains death scenes?? Amazing \n\nI liked the romance subplot, Vincenzo and Cha Young have so much chemistry even just as friends, they seem to genuinely like each other and their romance felt like a natural progression rather than it being forced because we expect them to get together\n\n\nThings I didn't like \n\nThe pacing I felt was very off, the show also started very aimlessly for me, a lot of the episodes are full of filler plotlines that were unnecessary and dragged down the quality of the show, there would be a lot of seemingly major problems that arise in the last 5 minutes of an episode that leave of as a cliffhanger then those plot points get resolved within the first 10 minutes of the next episode. \nThis might be unpopular but I feel like Vincenzo's actor was a bit miscast, don't get me wrong I don't think Song Joong Ki is a bad actor I thought his acting was pretty solid but his features were very soft and too cute for the role, he really didn't convince me that he was a  hardened mafia lawyer that had done horrible things, being like that changes a person you can see it from their facial expressions and their eyes you can see that this is a person that's not to be messed with, I just sadly wasn't convinced half the time and that took me out of the show sometimes \n\n \nThe Charecters \n\nVincenzo - Again I love the fact that they didn't make him an Angelic hero for the peolpe with no real flaws, the show acknowledges (though not all the time) that he is not a good person, he kills tortures and kills people, other than that I don't have much to say we didn't really get much backstory on his life in Italy (only flashes and throwaway lines) I would have loved a bit more context to how he became the person he is today, to flesh him out a bit more \n\nHong Cha young - I love her character so much, and again she isn't a black and white good person she began as an  entirely selfish lawyer, who would do horrible  things for her job regardless of who she is hurting but her father's death changed that, it made sense and I liked it, I also live the parallel between her and lawyer Choi Myeong Hui, the way I interpret it is that Cha young would have ended up like her if circumstances were different \n\nJang Joon Woo- If I'd watched just the first episode and someone told me that he was the main villain I would have felt like I was being gaslit, I like the plot twist, he is also the  first villain that I've seen in kdrama to introduce himself with a PowerPoint presentation I love that scene the way the power shifted from one end of the room the other as it went on, props to the writers\nI also think he is made better Taecyeon's acting he really sold me as an eager to please intern in the beginning and then as an entirely unhinged psychopath in the end, I can still hear high pitched temper tantrum scream as I write this \n\n(Unrelated but I know 2PM songs but I don't  know much about the members and finding out that Jang Joon Woo was 2mp's Taecyeon made his \"can you feel my heartbeat\" scenes funnier in retrospect)\n\nJang Han Seo - He is an angel in my heart and must be protected, his death scene was the first and only time that I actually cried during this drama especially because of the timing of it, don't mean to sound like a broken record player but again I love that they made him to horrible things in the beginning, his brother abuses him from when they were children and throughout the events of the show and it affects him he lashes out hits the people around him and did drugs when he was younger, people that grow up in abusive situations don't usually grow up to be well adjusted people, he does change though once he has a better influence in his life and removes himself from under his brother's thumb, the show made at least one character change to show that even if you are horrible you can change and I really like that\n\n\nOverall I really liked the show, it would have been way better if the side characters were given  less screen time and it was cut down to about 14 episodes to get rid of some of the filler plot points \nThe humour was excellent at times and fell short of being funny at other times, like I would understand what the writers were trying to do but the execution just felt off, I also would have loved it if the humour was darker, it would have matched more with the themes of the overall plot more\nI would give the show a 9 if it wasn't for the filler and the fact that the humour sometimes fell just short of being funny , I'll personally give it a 8/10 \n \nI also really want to hear other people's opinions on the show and how they saw it",

It was a very realistic take on just people in general. No one is ever pure good or pure evil. \n\nI fell in love with Vincenzo and HCY as a couple. I\u2019ve never been one to ship anyone celebrity but with them I shipped them hard IRL. Their rapport and chemistry was soooo believable that I almost felt like I was spying on their relationship. I was a bit crestfallen when it was reported SJK has a girlfriend and then a wife! I always hoped it would be Jeon Yeo Been. But anyway, that\u2019s besides my point. \n\nThe pacing was a little off and the editing of the scenes where the villains were plotting and Vincenzo and co were plotting always felt choppy but overall I really loved the script, cinematography, and small bread crumbs of romance. I\u2019m\nHoping for Vincenzo 2 but not holding my breath.",

            "comment": "While I also felt the side characters could've gotten a bit less screen time, I appreciated what I felt was, at times, an homage to movies like Kung Fu Hustle.  Especially when they were showing the tailor's signature moves with scissors, etc, it was really giving me that vibe.  I think King Fu Hustle (and Shaolin Soccer) are martial arts comedy at its best and it while the comedy in Vincenzo was never at that level, it was nice to see. (Ok one more edit, I do want to give credit to the pigeon scene&gt;! \\- that was amazing comedic payoff and was a great example of how the show could use humour to subvert expectations of darkness and not take itself too seriously!&lt;).\n\nDefinitely agree that some of the pacing was a little off and it could've been a tighter 14 episodes.  But overall I really adored Vincenzo and I felt like the darkness of the final episodes really stuck the landing and came full circle to the dramatics of the pilot.\n\nIt's a drama I comfortably recommend to friends/coworkers who don't regularly consume a lot of other East Asian media, or similar Southeast Asian media, but I usually do give the caveat that the tone might seem a little all over the place for the first few episodes and that it's worth sticking around.",

            "comment": "These comments are not directed at just the OP. I'm commenting on other comments as well. They are just my opinions.\n\nThis is my all time favorite kdrama. I have watched it 4 times so far and am sure to watch it again. It was not the first one I watched but it was one of them. Every time I watch I discover new things I missed before (last time I watched I realized that the banker's mother was dressed up just like Queen Elizabeth of UK, down to the Corgis. I don't now how I missed that before). Some of the shots are so incredibly well framed, the OST is beautiful and the opera music is especially well used throughout.\n\nUnlike some of the posters I really enjoyed all the subplots related to the residents, etc. I think they show Vincenzo's evolution into more of a human being. Through those experiences he discovers a family which wants to embrace him and support him. The comedy is silly but fun, not laugh out loud, but humorous.\n\nSong Joong Ki does have a really sweet face, but I think that is a part of what makes Vincenzo able to do all the crazy stuff he does. He does not look like a killer, but he is. I thought he did a great job, especially when he breaks into the glass house when the baddies are all sitting around plotting. I could really feel his cold anger in that scene. I think he did a great job with the part. Someone more sinister could not have made the residents feel so caring about him.\n\nI agree that the early scenes with Hong Cha Young are a bit over the top and cringy. I think she gets much, much better as the show moves along. By the middle her character is more even handed and developed. Taecyeon does a fantastic job in his dual roles. Kwak Dong-yeon is perfect for his role and really makes you care for his plight. He tries so hard to become a decent person. In general, I think the casting was spot on.\n\nThe story itself is the best anti-hero story I know. The character of Vincenzo is complex and he has done and does really horrible things to other bad humans, but somehow, he manages to hold on to some scrap of humanity and the people who surround him in Korea help him recover more.\n\nI just want to say thank you to the OP for posting this. It is something I have wanted to do for awhile, but haven't gotten around to.\n\nOh, and the horse riding scene is definitely drool worthy.",

Remember, these are fictional characters, so my voiced thoughts won't hurt their feelings... hopefully not yours, either.\n\nI thought the show was an OK watch. I agree about the pacing being way off the further along you got, and the filler plots were an insane amount. My two biggest gripes about the show were...\n\n1. The identity of the main villain was revealed way too quickly. I think the reveal was in &gt;!episode 4!&lt;. I feel that an opportunity was missed to have a truly shocking twist by hiding the villains identity at least until episode 10. The betrayal the audience would've felt had we seen more close interactions with (said villain), and the leads as a \"nice guy\" would've been pretty epic. \n\n\n\n2. The FL was beyond annoying. She wasn't funny and made over the top facial expressions and exaggerated body movements. In some scenes, it was actually pretty funny,  but because she did these things in *every scene she was in*, it became tiresome whenever she was on screen. I found it hard to comprehend how this suave mafia guy could fall in love with such a spaz. Don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed certain FL characters who gave off chaotic energy,  but there was just something off-putting about this particular performance.",

Even when SJK's wedding was announced I saw some shippers saying he is in love with vincenzo actress \ud83d\ude05.  \n\nAnyway - the story, the cinematography, ost, mystery and all the serious parts were made realllyy well 9/10.

I didn\u2019t even follow Kpop before then.\n\nI don\u2019t recall the haircut scene you\u2019re talking about, but two of his members (Nichkhun and Chansung) did make a brief cameo. It was the scene where JJW/Taec was watching tv and there were two guys that were seemingly about to fight on the rooftop. \n\nNichkhun is Thai and is bigger over there as an actor, though he had a tiny role in arthdal chronicles. He also dated someone from snsd many moons ago. \n\nChansung was in a bunch of dramas including what\u2019s wrong with secretary Kim and my h\u00f4m love. \n\nJunho is the most well known actor of the group. His latest was the red sleeve, but he was also in just between lovers/rain or shine and chief Kim. \n\nThere are two more members, but they\u2019re not into tv/movie acting from what I can tell. Wooyoung recently started variety shows and Jun k does a lot of different things.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for another Taec drama, blind was really good. I\u2019m watching bring it on ghost and it\u2019s been pretty good too. Slightly sweet with lots of humor and action.\n\nOne last thing: apparently they\u2019re going to have a concert late summer after a really long hiatus (enlistment reasons).",

So to me it felt kind of like a jab at one of 2PM's era's where they were supposed to have a \"stronger and more mature\" look? I think I googled something like that - could be wrong, was probably one of those late night rabbit holes and I am remembering wrong....\n\nanywho, just let me know if there is any inside jokes, it just feels like a loaded scene with some of Taec's responses/glances and some of the lines seem like they are double entendre-esque\n\nETA: corrected a detail",

It had (for me at least) the best mixture of action comedy and drama. Also having real stakes and real deaths made the tv show  better in comparison to other kdramas where people simply dont die. The chemistry between the tennants of this complex building and between vincenzo and the ffemale lawyer are the best chemistry ive seen since \" crash landing on you \" .",

            "comment": "Love this drama!\nPersonally,  I thought the main plot was the weakest part of the show - both the content and the pacing. I loved the show for the acting, the banter, the cinematography,  the styling, the locations (refreshing change from just rich and luxurious), the chemistry,  and the people! I actually loved the side characters and the interactions. I would love to see a different drama without the mafia element but with all the same cast as a slice of life drama. The lives of people working and living in this complex, dealing with everyday stuff. \nSo many parts of the main plot are entirely unbelievable but it is a drama so I suspend critical thought and enjoy it. One of my main things was..even if I am a slightly flawed/selfish character like FL was for a bit, would I still fall for a guy who I find out is in the mafia and has killed people for no reason other than loyalty to the mafia? I feel we needed more of a backstory with a better explanation of his descent into a murdering mafiaso. Again..suspend thought and enjoy the pretty \ud83d\ude0d",

My only problem was the length of the episodes - that extra 10-15 mins sometimes dragged. \n\nI\u2019m rewatching the dubbed version with my husband - it\u2019s great watching him react to the big twists. They have dubbed all the Korean with English, but when Vincenzo speaks Italian, they leave SJK\u2019s voice. It works surprisingly well.",

The next issue I have is with Hong Cha Yung, it\u2019s super hard for me to accept this show because she\u2019s sooooo out wild and he allows her to be wild. He trusts her with his secret when she has such a big mouth. However, knowing me I will continue watching and hope it gets better, since from the comments I noticed they didn\u2019t replace or kill off the character.",

I'm so glad that I did. This drama is absolutely great. I'm already sad that it's over. Don't give up on it!",

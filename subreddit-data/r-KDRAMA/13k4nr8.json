This show has done a wonderful job of creating real kids dealing with family issues, poverty, study pressure, and teenage relationship angst - all in 15-minute episodes. \n\nThe intensity between the leads simmers on low heat for now, but with jealousy added to the fire it looks like the feelings may boil over anytime. &gt;!YooJae's jealousy doesn't seem to be that of a best friend. I feel he is aware of HanJun's feelings for him and confused about his own.!&lt; Can't wait for next week!\n\nPS. The actress who plays ChaeYoung played BitNa in The Eighth Sense.\n\nPPS.

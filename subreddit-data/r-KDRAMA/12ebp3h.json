    "postText": "Another Friday, another weekend -- welcome to *the Weekend Wrap-Up*! This is a free-for-all (FFA) discussion post in which *almost* anything goes, just remember to be kind to each other and don't break any of our core rules. Talk about your week, talk about your weekend, talk about your pet (remember the  pet tax!). Of course, you can also talk about the dramas and shows you have been watching.\n\nThis is also the space to share content that would otherwise not qualify as self-posts under our rules -- like rumored casting news and discussions about non-kdramas.\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or anything you think should be redacted.** If you are using Markdown and not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

From Cha Eunwoo, to Kang Hodong, to Lee Dong Wook, it was practically like seeing a play by play of all of the shows and dramas Seunggi has done. Honestly, if I was him I would have teared up because it's was like seeing the sweet fruits of friendship after 15+ years of hard work.\n\nHUGE UPDATE: They releases official pics on his [companies Insta](https://www.instagram.com/p/CqwRhsAvbT1/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)!!! They look so cute that I can cry out of happiness \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79",

Loved the performances, the revenge and crazy were off the roof, bad decisions left and right, and by the end of it &gt;!got pretty violent and bloody, and I'm not sure how I feel about that ending, seemed too vague for me, but I loved how they did the trippin' talk during the last episode... so did they both die or lived in the end?!&lt;\n\nEdit: for fs sake, I actually googled \"ending explained\" and rewarched the last scene to see with my own eyes the hand movement I didn't  notice the first time. Well, it's the middle of the night, and I binged all 10 eps in one sitting... during the last few minutes I had some crazy theories how this is gonna end (be warned, heavy spoilers ahead): &gt;!1)they die from poisoning, 2) oh, they woke up but covered with some tree branches - time must have passed and they must have died and now waking up as ghosts, 3) oh, are they entering a tunnel with a bright light at the end of it? that must be the end for them, right? 4) wait, a gunshot? someone must be dead now for sure... 5) ehmm... he looks like he's about to die, and she just lies next to him, time passes, strange beeping sounds might mean he died, maybe she died for some strange reason as well... 6)after reading the article and rewatching the last scene - huh, so he's alive and embracing her and they live happily ever after... THE END!&lt;",

I do want to watch S2/P2 of **Decoy** but given the pacing in S1/P1, I'm waiting till all episodes are out before I dive in, which will hopefully make the watch experience seem quicker/less dragged out.\n\nMeanwhile, my rewatch of **Lie After Lie** is still wringing the tears from me. Also went through to find an appropriate Challenge for it and discovered ML Yeon Jung Hoon is a '78 Year of the Horse! This was a very welcome surprise as this was the category that might have required the most research.",

When he's trying to flirt with her but she just debuffs him and calls him a kid but acknowledges how good he it at it ahaha. Also, in the second trailer, the contrast of the overlay narration vs. the scenarios of both them (their ideal partner vs. reality) -- ahh!! This might just awaken my love for noona romances (something I wasn't super big on before).",

            "comment": "I had decided to not care about the *problematic stuff* in It's Okay, That's Love on my first rewatch, but it's really hard. \n\nI find it so interesting (read: disgusting) that the ML &gt;!just talks about consent in one scene and everyone\u2019s like wow he's saying something I\u2019ve never heard and in the very next scene he doesn't ask the FL for consent before kissing her (she is also somewhat drunk). I know he's supposed to keep pushing her boundaries and he's insightful sometimes and makes her realise certain things aren't as difficult as her mind makes them out to be but omg the thing he does there is literally sexual assault and the FL slaps him and wants to run away but he doesn't let her.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And omg Sung Dong-il\u2019s character is too dumb for a psychiatrist. He says, \u201cwhy would she LET HIM RAPE her? as if people allow the rape. and he also says \u201cwhy would he rape her? he doesn't lack anything.\u201d!&lt; Incredible! \ud83d\udc4f I remember other problematic scenes from this drama too so it was really hard for me to like it when I had watched it the first time, even though I did like most part of it. Ah, SDI\u2019s character &gt;!isn't even eager to listen to Jung Jae-bum \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f he's supposed to be a psychotherapist. At least when the FL is rude to patients she apologizes.!&lt;",

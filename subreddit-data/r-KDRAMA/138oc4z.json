I guess, just like in season 2, he's just waiting for Prof. Cha to make a mistake on his own accord and that mistake would allow him to allow a little flexibility in his process of saving lives as a doctor. Doldam is still in a countryside, so I just thought that they learned and adapted resourcefulness and flexibility along the way because of the less things that they have (understaffed, less/old technological equipments, etc) and that is what the city doctors surprises them.\n\nI have to read this comment again after the series ended to see if my guess is right.",

Maybe that's why Woojin feels so guilty. &gt;!I don't think it's a misdiagnosis on his end - the skier definitely didn't have physical injuries, but the mental stress might have led to his final injury. So Woojin probably feels guilty for not considering Jang Dong Hwa suggestion and gave him a break.!&lt;\n\nAnyway, Jang Dong Hwa is like the gen z among the bunch of millennials and gen x. Maybe he'll teach them a little about mental health while the seniors will teach him a little about taking hardships.",

He should know better that the moment he puts on the white robe, he needs to be impartial and treat and every patient fairly and equally.

The entire let's offend Dr. Seo because he made a mistake made me red- as if this man wasn't bunking SURGERIES to play PubG!! \n\n&gt;!I was hooting to loudly when Dr. Kim humbled him! like what gives you the right to judge everyone when you aren't doing anything except looking at the clock! !&lt;\n\nI think Dr. Jang's story line will focus on the stress and rest the doctors have &amp; don't have respectively. \n\nThe new CS resident has his own short comings but he is ready to face and learn - I loved how Eun-Jae was so encouraging of him. I think she'll do a great job as a teacher. \n\nHonestly I don't think Dr. Jang, with that temper and mindset of his, be humbled this quickly yet I liked how &gt;!Woo-Jin complimented him and encouraged him. following the advice too. I also absolutely loved how the entire team was eavesdropping to their conversation \ud83d\ude02!&lt;\n\nKim Sabu giving Dr. Yoon lollipop as an appreciation was sooooo cuteeeeeee Aigoooo! \n\nNow a Papa Cha rant! \n\n&gt;!The entire Fundamental, principal and whatever seemed to a nice excuse for him to find a easier way for the operation one that will not land him into any kind of soup. Apart from that he isn't even being a good father to Eun-Jae. I understand you would not want your doctor daughter to be held liable for any kind of complication but You are not only being doubtfully of your own daughter's skill but also not being a supportive father- I'm he is a CS too he could have gone in the theater and monitored Eun-Jae. But no he wanted to stay way from any liability. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Papa Cha's entire issue against Dr. Kim is that he has pride &amp; success in a small hospital in a town's outskrits? or is it that Dr. Kim somehow manages to fully save a patient will Papa Cha is stuck to his fundamental and sterness. he felt betrayed the Eun-Jae followed Sabu in the opreation theater for a crazy procedure and thinks that his daughter - is what going crazy? he valued nothing about the fact that the patient's opreation was successful and that his daughter did that but lectured his daughter about fundamentals and principles! WAAAH!!!!!&lt;\n\nHe took literally everyone with him &gt;!and I hope Woo-Jin doesn't get into his ego manupilation traps and walks out of the trauma center. !&lt;\n\nAnyway, \n\nIt seems like that this season is about &gt;!Dr. Kim questioning and monitoring Dr. Senior Cha and not otherwise. Atleast that's what I made out of the preview and I'm excited if that's the case. I would love to see Papa Cha being humbled By Dr. Kim, Dr. Seo and every other Doldam staff! !&lt;",

Could it be that Dr Kim saw something in him that we didn't, like how he did with the rest of the doctors in S1 and S2.\n\nWoojin was not at all nurturing though and with the way he berated him -  I wouldn't be surprised if he quit the hospital or even the profession. Some of the words and tone he used were so harsh and confidence crushing. THis is obviously he development arc for S3.",

Heck in S1, Master Kim used to straight up tell people to quit and give up their medical careers cause they suck. Woo-jin didn't deal with this because he was already exemplary. \n\nWoo-jin is basically his successor, so he probably feels that he has to take the same approach. Also, IRL the resident probably would have been already asked to leave the hospital given all of the severe indiscretions in the first two episodes.",

But, WJEJ are still the WJEJ we know. Sure Woojin smiles more, but he still knows how to annoy Eunjae. And Eunjae is still that too wholesome &amp; pure character who shares her tomato juice. \n- I really like this whole Woo Jin &amp; Jang Dong Hwa arc going on. It really gives us a flashback of Kim Sabu &amp; Kang Dong Ju\u2019s relationship back then. \n- Curious about Eunjae\u2019s family dynamic. It seems so me that this struggle will be different from Do In Beom\u2019s and we know how pure hearted Eunjae is when it comes to her family.\n\nAbout the Episode 4 Preview &gt;!

(To be fair, she's not home, but still!) That's such an invasion of privacy. You're staying there temporarily. If I was letting mom stay over at my house and I had a roommate, , I'd be upset if they start going through my roommate's clothes and stuff.",

Wow, over 30 years old! I guess that yes, it isn't considered 'correct' to be living together unless you are married, especially for middle-high class families.\n\nEven though the couple have already been living together for 3 years, everyone at the hospital think that Woojin is staying in a boarding house! lol.",

I cried when Master Kim asked the son to sign on the consent form for surgery for his mother. I remembered my late dad and missed him more.!&lt;\n\n- &gt;!I love that cute scene between Eun Tak and Ah Reum.!&lt; Ah Reum's smile is really cute. I love her smile to be honest - cute, innocent and happy.\n\n- &gt;!Seo Woo Jin is learning how to be a mentor to his younger doctors. Even Dr. Jung taught him to explain things for Dr. Jang in order for him to understand and to follow along. Seo Woo Jin getting angry at Dr. Jang's valid advice reminds me of Dr. Kang and Master Kim's frequent quarrel in s1 because of Dr. Kang's inferiority complex to Master Kim. And also it reminds me of Dr. Do In Beom's always getting angry at the intern doctor.!&lt;\n\n- Master Kim's comment of let them butt heads and bond over it and they'll grow as an adults. \ud83e\udd23\n\n- &gt;!Love that scene when Master Kim got angry at Dr. Jang.!&lt; When he said that his true specialty is humbling people, that's true though and I miss seeing that side of him. All of what he said during that convo was true though even in real life even the part of always complaining without doing nothing.\n\n- I wanna know more of the backstory of Dr. Jang. I wanna know why he's timid and where did that anger comes from. \n\n- &gt;!Lol at eavesdropping during the convo of Dr. Seo Woo Jin and Dr. Jang Dong Hwa at the end. \ud83d\ude02!&lt;\n\n- I have watched the Ghost Doctor and the first time I see Dr. Yang it reminds me of his role in the Ghost Doctor betraying Rain. And that Dr. Jang reminds me of Kim Bum's timidness of being a doctor in his early days in that show. As well as Kim Min Jae who have grown so well after the first two seasons of the show. It shows because he looks matured here. \n\nI'm enjoying the show so far and how I wish Dr. Kang and crazy whale make a cameo. I really wanna see them in s3 and see Master Kim's reaction seeing his first students.",

    "postText": "**Our Guiding Moderation Approach**\n\nAs the global popularity of kdramas have grown, membership in our community has also skyrocketed. The bigger our community has grown, the more diversity there is in the interests, wants, and habits of our community. While our rules, policies, and moderation practices are continuously evolving with the growth of our community, our 'bottom line' approach and philosophy towards moderation in this community remains unchanged. \n\nEssentially we view r/KDRAMA as a subreddit dedicated to the ***kdramas*** -- that is to say the universal common factor for all members of this community is that *we all watch kdramas*. Beyond watching kdramas and discussing them though, it is apparent that the interests and wants of the community members differ from each other. While all of us are united in watching kdramas and discussing them, some will go beyond just watching and discussing kdramas to being fans of actors and actresses, with an interest in their personal lives beyond their acting work. Similarly, some of our community also go beyond Kdramas and consume other K-entertainment such as Kpop, variety shows or movies. However all these are in the realm personal preferences beyond the universal common factor of watching and discussing kdramas. \n\nAs a mod team, we have chosen to steer our community based on the most universal common factor uniting us all -- the watching and discussing of kdramas. And even within this most universal commonality, we differ from each other in *which dramas* we watch as we do not all watch the same dramas. Thus, based on this aspect of differences between us as viewers, we have to seek a compromise and a balance of interests where ***no posts*** about a single drama or issue dominate our subreddit feed because it is a fact that there is no single drama or issue that is of interest for every single member of the community. As a result, our rules and policies strictly limit what types of content may be shared ***as posts*** within our community, especially with regards to news items. \n\nWe know this approach does not cater to everyone's preferences but it does satisfy the most universal common factor that brought all of us to this community. This approach is a compromise that balances various interests of our large and diverse community, we ask that users who are not satisfied by this compromise to also think about other users that hold different opinions and are partaking in this compromise too -- a bit of kindness, tolerance, and understanding goes a long way.\n\n**Our Rules and Policies**\n\nOur moderation of the subreddit is done according to our [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies), which the mod team reviews and revises regularly in accordance to the growth and state of the community.\n\nWhile we maintain an abbreviated version of our rules in our sidebar widget on New Reddit, it is the full rules and policies contained within our wiki, as linked above, that ultimately governs and guides moderation in our subreddit.\n\n*There Are Too Many Rules*\n\nAside from conduct rules, the bulk of our rules are on what content may be posted ***as posts*** in our community, such as which specific types of news articles are allowed. If you do not want to take the time and energy to review our content rules, then you can choose to just engage with the community via commenting only. For comments, as long as you remain respectful and on-topic to the post at hand, you will be fine. There is no need to make posts if you find navigating our content rules to be too challenging. \n\nWe especially encourage new members of our community to refrain from immediately making post submissions when they first join our community and instead engage with our community through commenting and observing the type of discussion and review posts that are posted within our community. By observation and engagement via commenting, many new users and new watchers of kdramas will better understand kdramas and our community, which often helps ensure that when users do end up making posts, these posts are a good fit for our community. This is especially the case as our community tends to receive many submissions of content that is rehashed in our community or has information already available within our community's subreddit wiki resources.\n\n*Censorship! or But My Freedom of Speech*\n\nThe [Reddit User Agreement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement) does not guarantee freedom of speech rights and in fact clearly state that content posted to Reddit is subject to deletion and removal at Reddit's sole discretion. If your content is deleted by Reddit, please reach out to them to argue your case.\n\nFor content removed from the subreddit by the moderators -- please note that removal of content from a subreddit only means that other members of the community can no longer view the content within the subreddit, it ***does not*** mean that the moderators have deleted your content. \n\nImportantly, subreddits are not obligated to permit all kinds of content to be posted within the community. In fact, moderators are expected to create and enforce rules for their subreddits^[1](https://www.redditinc.com/policies)  while removing posts and comments that violate their community-specific rules^[2](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001745332-Ways-to-become-a-moderator). As moderators, we have a duty to moderate what types of content is permitted in our community in order to preserve the culture, health, and engagement of our community. If the culture of our community is not acceptable for you, please seek alternate subreddits.\n\nIf you strongly believe that our moderation is in violation of your rights, legal or otherwise, in relation to the use of Reddit or that our moderation actions are in violation of Reddit's Moderator Guidelines, please contact Reddit directly as they have the ultimate authority over moderators. Here is Reddit Help's information about [Reporting](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/sections/360008810132-Reporting) that may be assist you in making a report.\n\n**Responding to Moderation Actions in General**\n\n***DO'S***\n\n* *Read anything from the mod team carefully.* The mod team leaves comments and messages to inform users, please take the time to read these comments and messages to be better able to participate in our community. Failing to read and comprehend messages and comments from the mod team is *never* an acceptable excuse for rule breaking behavior.  \n\n* *Remember the human*. Be civil when responding and engaging with members of the mod team. Incivility and hostility when responding to moderation actions will likely lead to *more* negative consequences, not less.\n\n* *Get some distance and perspective before responding*. Responding emotionally in the heat of the moment is generally not a good thing. We suggest that you take a break before responding.\n\n* *Have patience.* Moderators are volunteers and we are *not* online 24/7, please have some patience when engaging with the mod team when you do not receive an immediate answer. \n\n***DONT'S***\n\n* *Do not be hostile.* Hostility and incivility will get you no where other than banned from our community. Incivility is not limited to profanity or hate speech and includes things like personal attacks and insults made directly or indirectly.\n\n* *Do not assume you are the only one receiving moderation action.* In situations where multiple users are involved in problematic behavior, the mod team will take varying levels of moderation action on all users involved. *However*, the mod team is under no obligation to disclose their moderation actions to other users. Hounding the mod team to take action on others users will not help *your* case so do not do it.\n\n* *Do not engage in Rules Lawyering.* Rules lawyering will not help *your* case and wastes everyone's time. Ultimately the mod team has the final say on the interpretation and application of our Rules and Policies.\n\n* *Do not dictate how the mod team should moderate.* We will not moderate based on the whims of any one specific user so telling us that we should moderate a certain way because *you* think that is the better/best approach will not change our moderation.\n\n**Moderator Role Explained**\n\nModerators are users that help manage a subreddit community by moderating the content that is allowed in the community, establishing and communicating relevant rules and policies, and engaging with other community members. \n\n[**Moderating a subreddit is an unofficial, voluntary position.**](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement) \n\nModerators are [not employees of Reddit](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053690971-Off-platform-Community-Representation-Guidelines) and are limited in what they [can do](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002318552-What-mods-can-do), with many things [they cannot do](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002317172-What-mods-can-t-do). \n\nFor example, moderators **CANNOT** do the following:\n\n&gt; * move posts or threads\n&gt;\n&gt; * edit other users' submissions or comments\n&gt;\n&gt; * delete other users' submissions or comments (only remove in communities they mod)\n\nPlease keep the above information in mind when engaging with the moderation team in general and especially when responding to moderation actions. The active members of the r/KDRAMA team are also active users in this community and we love to see our kdrama community thrive. We volunteer our time and energy to the community because we treasure the community and kdramas, so please treat us with respect as you would other members of the community.\n\n---\n\n*Note:* This post is part of our recurring post series 'The r\\/KDRAMA Approach' which highlights different aspects of our subreddit moderation approach and policies. Comment replies to this post are not regularly monitored by the mod team. If you need attention from the mod team, please either start your comment with \"Mods\" or send a Modmail.",

I almost cried and my toes definitely curled once or twice from the sweetness. The focus was almost exclusively on our main leads, who I think have great chemistry on the whole, and there was something very dreamlike and atmospheric in the way time passed from scene to scene.\n\nIt is really interesting too how this show manages to fit in what family trauma does to the next generation. It\u2019s a far more nuanced show that I was expecting and I\u2019m delighted by the surprise.\n\n&gt;!the ending absolutely broke my heart. Both of them were so wounded. When Yoojae threw the chocolates on the ground I almost cried. It was a much more visceral and painful confession/apparently rejection scene than most. I am absolutely not convinced that Yoojae doesn\u2019t harbor the same feelings.!&lt;",

I think the claustrophobic feel comes from the many ways they are suppressed - financially, family-wise, from the exam pressure, and most importantly, their suppressed feelings for each other.

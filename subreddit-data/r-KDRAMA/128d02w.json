Why is he called this? Is it a term just for this particular figure, because he was supposed to be handsome, or is it referring to something else - maybe the fact that he is royalty, but not, or was royalty, but is now deposed/missing/regrettable because his father was deposed/killed, and he is a liability/no longer needed or wanted?",

            "comment": "So this past week I watched a lot, but just finished bingeing the Taiwanese drama **The Perfect Match**. It's 22 episodes about a classically trained chef and a street food vendor, and it managed to hit a million tropes while always feeling authentic. Even when the characters are doing something stupid, their behavior is never irrational; there's always a visible motivation. The acting is top-notch, the cinematography is exquisite and makes it feel like a warm bath in a Wong Kar Wai  cinematic universe.\n\nThe acting and dialog was so consistently realistic, I found myself trying to Google whether any of the actors were professional chefs they just brought in for stunt casting. The chemistry between the leads is fire, and for once, you can tell which of the side characters are going to end up together because their relationship blossoms organically rather than checking off the plot box.\n\nIf you've been watching a lot of thrillers lately like I have, I highly recommend this series as a comforting, enjoyable, emotional kiddie coaster. It also deserves an award for the most realistic relationship dialog I've ever seen in a drama that also features fields randomly dotted with red heart-shaped balloons.\n\nWith all that said, here are some tropes I noticed:\n\nDisapproving Parents, Back Hug(s), Fish Kiss(es) \\[although not many; the kissing was in general really well performed\\], Love Triangle(s), Stare at the FL While They're Asleep, Wrist Grab(s), including Triple, Hand(s) on the Wall \\[best First Kiss evah\\], Girl Loses Balance and Guy Catches Her, including multiple compromising position landings resulting in ten-minute staring contests, Fighting female relatives, dead fathers' career plans for their kids, being ousted from a family company, board elections for a family company, piggyback rides, especially due to injury, a \\[Green\\] Truck of Doom!, an amazing OST including a song you will never get out of your head *but actually love*, spontaneous emotional combustion resulting in a brief hospital visit, forced cohabitation, fake engagement/dating, insane amounts of PPL including but not limited to vacuum cleaners, blenders, skin care products, and bubble tea; business marriage, ...\n\nThere were more but it's almost easier to list the modern-day trops that *aren't* in there, but they just really work in this drama without feeling forced.\n\nAnyway, there were a couple cringe moments, both intentional and unintentional, but it was just such a pleasant experience to watch even when I was bawling my eyes out, I had to at least say something.\n\nEDIT TO SAY: I randomly decided to watch **The Ghost Bride** off my list next and 15 minutes in to the first episode I discover to my delight that one of the MLs is played by Chris Wu (Wu Kang-ren), who just captured my heart in **The Perfect Match**. The universe loves me.",

I started watching Kdramas in the early 2010s during the golden age of the cross-genre, plot-driven complex romcom, and they've been few and far between for a while. \n\nHoping this one can fill that void, though it's a bit sus that it's coming out the same year as **A Time Called You** - the Kdrama remake of the Tdrama **Someday or One Day** - which is also a time-travel romcom thriller with a unique twist.",

I didn't really talk about dramas online until recently since I always watched them with my BF and discussed them irl so I never made an MDL or anything.  \n\n\nWhen it comes to these 'classic' types of romcoms that have other plot elements, though, I can list a few others that I have enjoyed that I think were less popular:  \n\n\nFrom the OG early days of tvn/jtbc dramas raising the bar there were gems such as: Hogu's love, Cyrano Dating Agency, Manhole (this one is really controversial - lots of people hated it but I think it is one of the most underrated romcom dramas ever), The Greatest Love (hong sisters drama I liked the most other than Master's Sun), Pride and Prejudice (darker and less comedic show but it's a good hybrid prosecutor thriller and romance), I'm Not a Robot (another controversial one, sorry world but I loved the chemistry), Surplus Princess (far on the silly/comedic side but it was so cute), Emergency Couple, Familiar Wife (I dropped because I hate the main actress but it was a quality show), Twenty Again, TBH the entire Let's Eat series, The Package (also controversial but I really loved it), Ex-Girlfriends' Club.   \nHonorable mention to not-a-romcom Avengers Social Club, which was more about friendship but may have been one of the best shows to ever come out of this era of TVN programming imo. Obviously Age of Youth and Be Melodramatic fit here too for more girl-mance slice of life.   \n\n\nFor more recent shows it seems like there is a dry spell with the romcoms. I really liked Mad About Each Other and Gaus Electronics but both are more comedy and slice of life than plot-driven.   \n\n\nThis is neither here nor there but I really miss the golden days of OCN procedural shows that were actually procedurals, like God's Quiz and Missing M, instead of the serialized thrillers they're always putting out now with long, convoluted drawn-out time travel plotlines.",

We definitely have some likes/loves in common, and at first glance I'm adding **Nine Ins Two Outs** and **Familiar Wife** to my watchlist.\n\nIf you're looking for a new procedural and don't mind a supernatural (not time travel) element, **Missing: The Other Side 1 / 2** were great. **Partners for Justice 1 / 2** were also solid and involve a forensic examiner ML like God's Quiz.\n\nAs for Hana Kimi, highly recommend the recent Thai version **F4 Thailand**. It updates the story while keeping the main elements intact and manages to deliver a well-rounded drama.",

So sue me. I am \"LGBT\" and the gay-for-laughs thing was a bit off color plus one of the most atrocious Second Lead Female Nightmare characters in the history of kdrama but I thought this one was really amusing and had some heartfelt moments that stuck. Also of note if you can tolerate Micky Yoochun after his scandal Sungkyunkwan Scandal was a fun romp, more for the side characters than anything else. Also if you can tolerate actors who have been in horrible scandals, Prosecutor Princess.   \n\n\nFor a more 'unusual' show from this era 9 ins 2 outs is probably my absolute favourite friends-to-lovers show. Doesn't follow most of the modern kdrama tropes because it preceded them. Interesting pacing. For old friends-to-lovers shows the Taiwanese version of 7000 days with you was also great, unlike the korean remake.  \n\n\nMore good underrated romcoms from the era you mentioned (best ones earlier on the list):  \n\n\nKing of Dramas, Producers (!!!! one of the best imo and started the 'mockumentary' genre in kdrama), Heart to Heart, Wild Romance, Fix You/Soul Mechanic if you don't mind the icky uncomfortable psychiatrist-patient dynamic. One that was popular and mentioned a lot but from this era is Kill Me Heal Me, I can't quite tolerate the FL lead's antics but the ML carried it for me. I also personally liked Marriage Not Dating and My Introverted Boss although I understand why they weren't for everyone. Protect The Boss was pretty fun.  \n\n\nFor more modern shows after this era I'm struggling to remember any I really liked other than Dali and Cocky Prince and to a lesser degree Her Private Life. They don't have as many exciting plot elements as the ones on your list but they were still good imo.   \n\n\nFor non-kdrama I think the ones I've seen that fit similar criteria to the shows you've mentioned:  \n\n\nLegally Romance was not as good as Someday or One Day but also was a pretty good time-travel show. Arsenal Academy is long for a kdrama viewer but really fun and cute, has a lot of the fun plot/mystery elements + cute romance. Also for a shorter but very high quality show, Reset may be the best chinese drama ever made imo. Only 8-ish hrs viewing time but worth every second. Honorable mention for A Snail's Love which is more on the heavy crime/mystery plot with more background romance.  \n\n\nFor japanese drama A Girl and Three Sweethearts and Kikazaru Koi niwa Riyuu ga Atte are the two best romcoms I've watched imo. Also s/o to the original Hana Kimi which was way cuter and funnier than the korean remake.",

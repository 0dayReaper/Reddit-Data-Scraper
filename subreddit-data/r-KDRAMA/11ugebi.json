    "postText": "Hello! I just finished watching TK: EM and I have some questions and thoughts. Would be great to hear some answers from those who understood better \ud83d\ude00\n\nOverall I enjoyed the series and watching the actors but I felt the pacing, editing and explaining could have been better. \n\nMy questions: \n- The very first scene in Episode 1 is clearly taking place in KOC 2022 and the detectives are Luna and other SJ. At the end of the series they show these two as detectives in LG\u2019s new/fixed universe\u2026.so how is it that they are interviewing an alive LL in handcuffs? Where did he come from? His past version got beheaded by LG and his future version got shot in that eternity space by JTE. But this LL looks like the one from the eternity space right? So how did he land up in 2022 KOC? What\u2019s the significance of that scene? \n\n- Are JY and LG kid dead after LG adult and JY interrupt the coup? That scene where adult Yeoung hugs the bloodied crown prince\u2026.are they dead or alive? If dead then how were they still alive at the end? \n\n- Did the scene mid-series where LG comes with flowers wearing the fancy outfit from the finale actually end up happening in \u201creality\u201d or no? How come? \n\nThoughts: \n\n- I wish they had stuck to the single time loop situation and taken it from there and not added the parts where LG changed past memories + goes back to the \u201cbeginning\u201d and changes the path\u2026.made things that much harder to follow and absorb. \n\n- I feel like there was a lot of waiting around for action and big events to happen (like the late queens memorial and build up to LL big plan) to get could have been dealt with better. \n\n- in the very last scene they showed LG and JTE holding hands and then these hands grow old together. Maybe it\u2019s whistful thinking on my part but I took that to mean that they finally found a way to settle down in one place and retired the Flute because as long as they were criss crossing universes through the eternity place they were going to remain young. Rmr what LL said when the flute became whole \u201cyou have eternity and something?\u201d Waiting for you. Hence also \u201cthe eternal\u201d in the title. \n\n- I think maybe LG and JTE got to keep their memories and stay alive as a thank you from the yo yo boy from making him whole again. LL wanted LG to just use the two broken pieces of flute together but LG felt it was wrong because the flute wasn\u2019t singing\u2026..(I realise  may have partly answered my own question above but I\u2019m still unsure haha).",

            "comment": "1. Lee Lim is being interviewed in ROK by the FL Tae Eul and her friend Kang Shin Jae (let's call him SML2). This happens at the end of episode 15 and beginning of episode 16. Prior to this Lee Gon had caught Lee Lim in KOC and handed him over to SML2 to keep him in custody in ROK. This is because after meeting Ji Hun's mother Lee Gon decides to change history again and make sure the flute doesn't land in LL's hands. But why does Lee Gon send him to ROK? Maybe because portal had to be open from both sides for Lee Gon to do what he planned to do. Tae Eul decides to go to the portal with LL to ensure he is killed if Lee Gon doesn't succeed.\n\nWhich LL is this? This is the LL who kills his future version in 1994 and reaches 2020. \n\nThe significance of the scene is I think to raise curiosity among viewers till we come to episode 16 ie the finale.\n\n2. Lee Gon and Jo Yeong are not dead. In the last episode Lee Gon goes after LL. While Jo Yeong protects the child Lee Gon. Jo Yeong is however injured in the process. Both Jo Yeong and Lee Gon grow up well in the changed scheme of things.\n\n3. The flowers scene never happens in reality. After Lee Gon kills Lee Lim everyone is in their own universe and the flower scene never happens as we are shown the flowers disappear.\n\nMy thoughts: IMO episodes 14 and 15 were really confusing. The part where Lee Gon travels back in time to save himself while Lee Lim gets killed by his younger self. Then we see him alive again!!!! But more than that I think after giving a good build up to Lee Lim we never see really see what he wanted to do. Yes he wanted to cause chaos. But beyond that we don't see much. After both parts of the flute come together he simply seems awed by it and doesn't care much about what happens to himself.\n\nAbout the end: I felt that the FL had to decide either way. Lee Gon is the head of state. It's a far more responsible job. He cannot sneak out and be unreachable every weekend. FL seems like someone who cannot commit. If she agreed he would have found a way to explain her presence despite her dopplelanger being around. Afterall Lady Noh lived in KOC for more than fifty years.\n\nThe yo yo boy - This guy confused me? Was he fate? A neutral observer? What was he?\n\nIMO Lee Gon, Tae Eul and Jo Yeong retain their memories of previous versions of history because they pass through the portal.\n\nHaving said all this I want to add I still throughly enjoyed the series. Reminded me Dark in some ways.",

                    "comment": "The yoyo boy was both fate and the personification of the flute. The reason I think he represents fate is that the string of the yoyo was always red, and one of the characters even points that out though the boy doesn't explain. He also exists in both worlds because the flute is broken and in both worlds. I think the reason he 'grows up' is because the flute is no longer divided. We know the divide caused the time stops, but the boy could had his time stopped because of it too. Thus, he's a child while being too knowledgeable and clearly supernatural until he ages at the end .The boy also reads the story of King Arthur...in English no less... who is the 'once and future king' in English folklore...an eternal monarch. And he looks up at Lee Gon in the security footage. He's outside the story, but trying to influence because it's pretty clear he doesn't respect  Lee Lim. \n\nMy biggest gripe with this series was not actually bringing yoyo boy in more. I felt he was a really mysterious and compelling character...the entire time I kept thinking he'd either  be the dragon god that created the flute...or that he was fate.  I'd have loved more exploration of him and even him being a more active part of the story. I would have preferred they cut a little bit back on Lee Lin's doppelganger manipulations that were impossible to keep track of anyway and given us more time with the actual mythic nature of the flute and it's history and the boy.",

                            "comment": "I think boy personifying the flute makes sense. But I didn't get the connection of the string being red. I also don't recall it but was the boy shown in Lee Gon's childhood too? I know he grows up in the end. But how do we know he wasn't growing up earlier? \n\nI think the boy sorta influences things when he helps Tae Eul escape in Lee Gon's universe. Otherwise I think his role was more of a neutral observer who wants to see how things go. \n\nAnother thing confused me was how does Lee Gon's uncle figure out that the bookstore guy was Lee Lim's man? Does he land at the bookstore by coincidence and recognise him as the traitor's follower. Another thing I wasn't clear about is that does the book store guy exchange places with his dopplelanger. The guy in Tae Eul's universe does most of Lee Lim's work.\n\n\nMy gripe on the show was the great build up given to Lee Lim and after that the writer didn't know what they wanted to do. He kept collecting all the dopplelangers but he didn't even seem to have a fool proof plan against Lee Gon except something vague like causing chaos. He banks on people who may not betray Lee Gon to kill him. Also we don't know why didn't Lee Lim try to retrieve the flute from Lee Gon when he was a child. It would have been much easier then rather than try to bring him down as an adult. Was it because he was passing years of Lee Gon's time in the no time zone? We can only guess! The dopplelangers of all the minor characters were very confusing. On rewatching I was able to figure out who was who. \n\nThe editing was also confusing. Like when Tae Eul first comes to Lee Gon's universe they are going to the stables and suddenly the scene shifts to the no time zone. Or when KOC is being attacked Lee Gon and Tae Eul have enough time to plant seeds on the way back. The entire part about Lee Lim (1994) killing Lee Lim (2020) and then Lee Lim (1994) landing up hale and hearty in 2020 was confusing. Usually it's Lee Gon who is explaining things to what he calls science students. Here he isn't aware of what had happened. But some explanation would have helped.",

                                    "comment": "The only thing I can answer is the red string/thread of fate.  It's used quite a bit in other dramas too (My roommate is a gumiho immediately came to mind) but It's an idea that there is a supernatural thread that connects usually two lovers who are destined to be together no matter what separates them, be it time or space. The mythology started in China, but both Japan and Korea heavily use it in a lot of media. It could be that the flute is using the red string as a yo-yo because it isn't guaranteed that in the current flux of things that the two lovers will be connected - the flute is literally constantly changing the chances until it's permanent, and upon being permanent, it can stop being a child using a toy for fate. It does use its own prompting, such as Lee Gon always hearing the flute to lead him to important places - such as when he hears it and it draws him to the hall where his father is killed since he NEEDED to be there to avoid Lee Lim taking the flute and to start the time..I'm reluctant to call it a loop because it feels more like a collection of rings, but you know what I mean. Also, the saving of Tae Eul  like you mentioned. The flute holds the red string and thus is at least attempting to keep the lovers connected.\n\nAs far as the dopplegangers... I hated it so much. Why did he kill the version of Lee Gon in our world when he was just a child and could have found a way to try to manipulate him and use him??? Wouldn't it be easier to have an actual identical copy of Lee Gon on his side? I would assume that it just didn't occur to him yet but then he keeps the mom alive to use her later so clearly this....plan...whatever it was, did occur to him early. \n\nThere are many ways the dopplegangers were all just tenuous gambles and didn't make sense most of the time. The lightning marks were confusing too - they marked people sometimes but not other times and why would it be connected to a storm anyway? Why is THAT the thing that triggers them?",

Now I get it why the child is called fate by many. I was unaware of the mythical background about the red string of fate. It makes sense that the flute beckons Lee Gon as a child to get hold of the flute. \n\nI think apart from killing his own dopplelanger killing the rest of the family didn't make sense. Having the King's dopplelanger would have certainly helped a lot. Not to mention the dopplelangers of the former king and his wife for the same reason. \n\nThe lightning mark occurs on people whose dopplelangers are dead and those who have been in both universes. That's why Lee Gon/Lee Lim get it but not Tae Eul/Luna or Yeong/Eun Sup. About thunder triggering it I suppose it's for dramatic effect more than anything else.",

The FL has a job in ROK, but she also has family and friends, a community, a life. He respected that, and did not value his way of life and his responsibilities over hers. They found a way to work it out, without either person having to give up everything. Yeah, it was harder, and perhaps less satisfying in some ways than the classic fairy tale HEA. Long distance relationships don't work for everybody.  But it was deeply respectful of both people - a very loving thing to do.",

    "postText": "Last week we had a popular post about [favourite tropes](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/12zd8gi/kdrama_tropes_thats_most_interesting_to_you/).  I thought it would be fun to vent about our most hated tropes and give examples where they were especially egregious.\n\nMy top, most hated trope is the noble idiot/dumb breakups.  Dramas can't seem to get away from that one.   One memorable one was in Love in Contract.  &gt;!In that one, there was absolutely no reasonable explanation except to make the leads pine and to watch them cry.  I can't even remember the reason it was so dumb.!&lt;\n\nMy second most hated trope that is often used in combination with the first one are time skips that break up our OTP.  Why?  Why do that to them, to us?  It's no fun.  Why can we see them having a long-distance relationship, cute moments skyping and talking on the phone and a lovely reunion at the end?\n\nAnother poorly done one is This is my first life.  &gt;!Luckily it was pretty brief and I forgave the drama because it was otherwise so good.  But the breakup was a bit nonsensical and our FL had to act completely out of character so that we could watch poor Lee Min Ki turn break down and suffer.!&lt;  \n\nA third infamous one was Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol.  &gt;!The less said about that one the better.  I think it wasn't so much noble idiocy as bad writing where they changed the ending at the last minute.!&lt;\n\n\nMy third most hated trope is constant miscommunications, where leads misinterpret each other's actions but don't talk to each other.  I find that more frustrating than anything else.  I can't think of an example because it's so freaking prevalent.  It makes me appreciate dramas like Run On, where our leads actually talk to each other.  &gt;!Incidentally was a drama where the seconds leads did break up but it was well-done and made sense.  I choose to think they got back together at the end.!&lt;",

A really good show that seemed to perfectly subvert all those tropes (except for this one) was \"**Love to Hate You**.\" It had a strong FL (who wasn't poor or naive), and though there were misunderstandings when they first met, once they both got to know each other and effectively communicate, they were honestly one of the best positive and motivating couples I've seen in a Kdrama. \n\nUNTIL, they had to use that USELESS trope at the very LAST minute.

Petition to normalize men having/showing emotions and talking about them in media, please and thank you. \n\nTop Picks:\n\n* **I Hear Your Voice** has a kind ML *and* SML who think FL is fabulous yet aren't blind to her flaws. There's a love triangle, but they're both supportive of her and only work through their jealousy with each other. \n* **Encounter** has a schmaltzy, golden age Hollywood vibe and a ML with the charm to match. He's respectful of FL's boundaries, but bold when the occasion calls for it. &gt;!Short breakup, doesn't even last an episode.!&lt;\n\nIf you've seen the other classic Kdrama noona romcoms (INR3, RIABB, WR), **High School King of Savvy** and **Rookie Historian** are two that often get passed over. HSKOS is kind of ridiculous but it has a super happy ending (&gt;!the only noona romance I've seen with a wedding!&lt;) and RK has the softest sageuk ML ever.\n\nCdrama also has some fun ones like **Falling into You** / **Love the Way You Are** / **My Fated Boy** / **The Rational Life** / **Why Women Love** that might appeal. They're much fluffier than Kdramas and usually don't have the break-up/separation tropes. \n\nOther Top Romance with Nice MLs:\n\n* **Hospital Playlist**: ML and FL are long-time friends and ML is always trying to brighten her day. Less romance more medical/slice of life, but great.\n* **Into the Ring**: ML is a bit buttoned-up, but he's sincere and supportive of FL after a short (well deserved) rocky start. \n* **My Strange Hero**: ML doesn't have the temperament to be in a revenge drama. He's a puppy who just wants to make long-suffering FL smile despite their fraught past.\n* **When the Weather is Fine**: ML has been quietly, shyly devoted to FL since they were kids. &gt;!Ambiguous ending, but happier than 90% of melodramas.!&lt;\n* **Run On**: Noona + non-noona romance, but both MLs are equally sweet, quirky and devoted. There's &gt;!a break-up for the 2nd couple but it makes sense given their circumstances and they remain friends.!&lt;",

(If you haven't seen *Dali and Gamjatang*, it has a hilarious subversion of this trope.)\n\nI actually have a theory about this. With the ROK having mandatory military service, currently ~1.5 years, for all male citizens, which is usually served during prime dating age, I bet almost everyone in the country has had to endure a forced separation from a romantic partner, making this trope far more relatable to them than it might be to the rest of the world.",

However, I think it might be more of a form of 'cultural propaganda' where the idea of waiting for a partner who you barely get to talk to/communicate with and just 'trusting' they will return and still love you is glamorized and lionized as a sign of a more romantic, ideal relationship. This is probably to culturally encourage people 'waiting' for loved ones in the military, but I doubt it's because the experience is so universal, more because it is seen as a moral good or lauded.",

Your recommendation somehow stuck in my mind.  OMG, it was just a GREAT drama.   A perfect 10.  Beautiful, funny, sweet, great characters and wonderful leads, great chemistry, and even the story was interesting and didn't get in the way.  And best of all there were none of the usual hated tropes, and as you said the show just played a trick on us and subverted the time skip trope.\n\n&gt;!The penultimate episode breakup was substituted by a life or death crisis, which served the same purpose really, separating out OTP and making one of them cry.  Still, I prefer that to a noble idiocy.  The show kept misdirecting us in that regard and it was quite funny.!&lt;",

The worst examples are **Crash Landing on You** and **Hometown Cha Cha Cha**. The characters even remember someone they brushed past years ago!\n\nOn the other hand the best use of the trope has been in **Healer** where the childhood connection makes sense as the leads are children of people who were friends and are in the same age group.",

I think the whole show would have functioned much better without it, or for example with them both experiencing similar situations in childhood, but not specifically TOGETHER. I tried to watch that show twice and dropped it both times after the childhood connection reveal. IDK, it felt incredibly forced and unnecessary to me and as I was watching it I kept thinking it was both 1. not surprising and too foreshadowed, 2. most of the plot points could have been accomplished with slight tweaks to make the childhood storyline less cliche, 3. the overall present day/workplace storyline pretty much didn't need this at all, and 4. the way the childhood scenes were filmed was really cheesy and took me out of it emotionally.

Being an ordinary girl and having a good looking rich guy fall in love with just because your of your imperfect personality is a dream a lot of girls have. It\u2019s also why there\u2019s so many dramas where the ordinary girl lead has random captain America strength for some reason",

I might even hate it a lot more and it is very common in a lot of newer dramas, especially ones that have a reputation for being 'deep' and 'well scripted' and 'emotional.' I get that at least this is a deep wound that a lot of viewers might find relatable but it's also upsetting to see so few 'healthy' families depicted.",

The childhood trauma felt weirdly romanticized and icky, I think the character relationship could have been near-identical without the childhood connection trope with only minor plot/script changes, so that ML could have 'a traumatic past' but not one that served as a pretext for his romantic feelings for FL.

This to me feels like 'too much' and I have a hard time believing this is such a common occurrence.",

One of the silliest variations in the separation-time-jump trope is where they never contact them - for a year and a half, or two - and the reason they give afterwards (after the other person has pined for them at home, then thought they've given up on them and never heard anything from them - no explanation; nothing) is that they would have 'lost their motivation and wanted to come home' if they heard their voice, or were in contact with them. Uh, I think if you're in a relationship with someone, and you love them, and you *don't* want that relationship to end, probably the best way to act on that is *not* to cut off all contact with them, and think it's gonna be fiiine when you get back in a year or more and they'll understand, and not have gone on to start a relationship with someone else/get married, not be somewhat traumatised by your ghosting of them and have trouble getting over that... Why on earth do this? What value does this create in a story? How does it help the growth of the characters, or our enjoyment as viewers? It's illogical and needlessly heart-rending.",

I saw that a few times and it just seems like an excuse to torture the male lead and create scenes where he cries and pines and sings sad songs.  Maybe you are thinking of &gt;!Oh my Ghost!&lt;.  I do like MLs being emotional, but I way prefer scenes where he is not emotional because of something the FL did to him.  I much prefer when they are upset and crying and the FL comforts them.\n\nI think you could still create some good scenes within the context of a forced separation.  When two people love each other, being apart is hard and just talking over the phone is unsatisfying,  Especially in a new relationship.  To me that would seem enough to cause tension, sadness and longing without the necessity of having the other lead be cruel by ignoring the other person.  You could even have one say, I need to focus on &lt;insert reason they are away&gt; and every time I talk to you, I just want to get on the plane and come right back.  I think it would be better if we didn't speak for a little while, but know that I love you and live for the day we are reunited.  Communication!  Then the other person knows what's happening instead of being tormented by it.\n\nAlso, I have also seen dramas where this exact situation occurs, there is a painful breakup, and one person goes away, only to come back several years later.  Meanwhile, the other person (usually the ML) was so devastated by this they shut down emotionally.  Then the other person comes back and expects to pick up right from where they left which creates tension, since a new love interest has just entered the picture.  But when you think about the situations are exactly the same, just with different outcomes.",

SFL at the end has to painfully acknowledge that she didn't protect ML at all from anything, and she doesn't get to come back and try to start things over.",

What I'm not sure about is why a small minority of shows STILL film kisses like this, but my guess is that in most cases it's for idol-actors to not upset their fans or in some cases because actors are young and possibly uncomfortable with full-blown kissing.   \n\n\nThe funniest censorship thing to me in kdramas is still how you could always tell in advance if some kind of sudden kitchen murder would occur because one of the knives on the counter or in the knife block would be blurred out like 20min earlier in the episode (they only ever blur a knife if it's going to be or has been used in violence, not for cooking lol)",

I think some of the worst fish kiss scenes are with 20ish year old idols with 14yo parasocial fan bases, whereas somewhat older idol actors tend to also have somewhat older and more mature fan bases that aren't as 'possessive' of them as romantic objects.  \n\n\nI can also understand that sometimes very young actors don't want to do full-on kisses especially when they are paired with much older actors (looking at you, Kim Sae Ron, Kim yoo Jung, Kim So Hyun) but the solution to this would be to stop casting teenaged girls as 28 year old characters opposite 35 year old actors rather than making kiss scenes 'tamer.' In fact, I could even do without kiss scenes entirely if there are other signs of intimacy/skinship in a show, but the unrealistic stupid kisses just take me right out of it and ruin the chemistry.  \n\n\nThey should also stop forcing Park Shin Hye to kiss, she's obviously generally disgusted by the concept so just let her do a hug or something.",

It seems kind of fetishistic like how certain mukbangers are fetishized, or it's supposed to be a 'personality trait' - oh look at this girl, so not like other girls, she's MESSY and UNSELFCONSCIOUS! But in reality if you walked around with food sauces smeared over half your face and never wiped your mouth it would be a sign of something like a developmental disability or sensory disorder and these characters are never shown to be disabled.  \n\n\nETA: I think it also makes me uncomfortable because it is something that children do and it's uncomfy for the FL to be child-ified.\n\nAgree that the openly talking about bowel movements and periods and stuff on korean shows seems refreshing as a Westerner though.",

My mom always taught me that both sharing food and slurping soup are disgusting and uncultured but I actually find food-sharing to be such a fun part of communal eating, especially if you're going out and want to try more than one thing at a restaurant so I really like how Kdramas (and other East Asian dramas) depict eating together as a shared experience of love/joy rather than this very austere act.",

Like I don't mind characters with a 'good appetite' but this girl ate like she had been starving in the desert for 30 days and didn't even have time to wipe her face.  \n\n\nThere was a weird resurgence of this trope more recently with the 2FL in Fight For My Way though and the scenes of her running around with food covering her face made me viscerally uncomfortable.  \n\n\nActually now that you mention this trope I also hate/am disgusted by 'romantic' scenes of characters wiping really gross food smears off other characters' faces on dates etc. I don't mind if it's like a tiny bit of milk foam from a latte or something but when they full on wipe gobs of yogurt or tteokbokki sauce off another character's face with their bare hands I always cringe internally.",

I feel like maybe it was mis-marketed as predominantly a 'romance' show while I felt that the central theme of the show was various kinds of love, bonding, healing from loss and learning how to cherish and honor memories but still move on.   \n\n\nI can see why you would find it hard to handle though, and I normally don't like this trope either.",

You're not fooling anyone!\n\nCharacters who just let a misunderstanding get them into serious trouble. No fighting back. No speaking up. Just standing there mouth agape. Its a really tiring conflict trope. \n\nLastly, its more of a second male lead thing but the soft boy,nice guy. \n\nHe never does anything but wait on the FL to notice him.

There are a few shows like 9 ins 2 outs where FL or ML full-on date the 'second lead' in a love triangle and I actually enjoy this when it occurs, which is rarely because of the 'fated love' obsession. Either that or they shoot their shot, get rejected and actually take the hint gracefully. The endless patient waiting around and being The Rock for the girl while she never even considers the second lead romantically is just really frustrating to watch both for its total lack of realism and because it feels like a complete waste of screen time that does nothing to move the plot forward. At least have the corner of the love triangle have some mixed feelings or doubts about the situation, feel pressured because she knows both guys are into her, or whatever.  \n\n\nI think it was the worst in retro kdramas where the 2ML was always incredibly passive and perfect, kind, patient etc. while the 2FL was always a scheming witch who would stop at nothing to destroy FL's life while ML endlessly tolerated it. Makes both the male characters seem spineless and basically promotes the idea women are always in ruthless competition with each other for men.",

Actually if you want to see how far kdrama has come since 2009 or whatever, watch it and weep (with happiness that they don't make them like this anymore).  \n\n\nLucky Romance was the same actress as She Was Pretty, and even though I really like the ML and thought there were charming aspects of the show, there is something with this actress where they always make her overact stupidity and airheadedness, even when she's supposed to be smart. She was in Kill Me Heal Me too as a successful psychiatrist but it was littered with similar 'clueless female' scenes and the thing is I've seen her acting serious roles so I know she's a great actress, she just gets typecast and directed into these awful roles.  \n\n\nAlso I think airheadedness is a common factor in Park Shin Hye dramas (she was simiultaneously badass and unbelievably stupid in Sisyphys for example) and old Yoon Eun-Hye dramas like My Fair Lady and Lie to Me. These were older dramas though so I think this was a more common character type for female leads back then.  \n\n\nThere was another Joy drama other than Tempted where she was also incredibly 'daft' but the drama was so forgettable I forget what it was called.  \n\n\nHonorable mention to Shin Se-Kyung who played one of the most insufferably dull and slow characters ever in Fashion King, but she was the least of that show's problems. She was a bit of an airhead in Bride of Habaek too but not to the same extent.",

They didn't want to break up, but staying together would have destroyed the ML's professional life and caused him to have to repay a whole load of money.  He said he would quit to be with her which was wonderfully touching, but I can see why someone would hesitate to have someone sacrifice their career for them.   In the end it resolved itself quickly, so not too annoying, and it was cute how at first, they said they would break up but just met in secret instead.!&lt;\n\nAnother I remember where it made sense was 100 Days my Prince.  &gt;!They had no choice but to break up as the prince had to sort out a lot before they could be together.  However, her playing hard to get after this, was annoying!&lt;\n\nA third one that I can remember and that was really well done was in Run On &gt;!for the secondary couple.  It was more bittersweet than angst-inducing.  That drama did everything right.!&lt;\n\nIt can be well done if the reason makes sense.  But I agree with you that when one of the leads makes a unilateral decision to leave because they think it's better for the other person, without communicating, that just boils my blood.  Doesn't the other person have a say?  That's nearly unforgivable I think.  But that's dramaland for you.",

            "comment": "Oh dang I was going to say 'dumb breakups and time skips where the character leaves for several years for no clear reason' but you covered those in your OP. Yes those are literally the two most annoying tropes in kdrama far and away!  \n\n\nThis is more of a subtle thing and I'm not sure if it is technically a trope at all but I hate when shows decide to use some sort of 'thematic metaphor' in every episode but then it gets really heavy-handed and takes over the plot. Shows where I think the 'thematic metaphor' worked were, for example, A Poem A Day, where the themes in each episode were explored via some piece of poetry. Shows where it didn't work for me were pretty much all the rest of them, but especially shows like Forecasting Love and Weather where the weather-based plots and metaphors were so heavyhanded and so dramatized it felt like they were completely taking over the show. Cutting to people crying and infrastructure breaking down every time the weather network got windspeed slightly wrong or whatever just made the whole show feel like a farce/parody of itself. I think this is supposed to make shows feel 'deep' but it just feels like bad writing to me.  \n\n\nI also really dislike the trope of grown adults in their late thirties or forties acting (or being) completely romantically inexperienced and even shocked/freaked out by the thought of hugging or holding hands, unless there is a REALLY good reason for the character to be like that (extreme insecurity/being a NEET, trauma, severe anxiety etc). I know it's partly a censorship thing so it can't be avoided to some extent, but it's more the extremely innocent virginal ATTITUDE that bugs me than the lack of skinship or the characters acting conservative in a new relationship. Like the whole 'my first love at 30/40/50!! i never even had a crush before!' plot isn't cute and in most places could be skipped entirely with no loss to the show. I think this trope exists for the same reason as the 'fated meeting in childhood the leads forgot about' trope - because there is some cultural love for this fated soulmate idea where the characters never had eyes for anyone but each other. Personally I just find it really corny and it makes the characters seem ultra immature. Do this with teenagers or college kids if you need this trope.  \n\n\nAlso people vomiting on other people, especially when being given a piggyback ride. I have literally never seen or heard of this happening IRL to anyone I know even people who regularly blacked out in college and it's just disgusting and usually adds nothing to the plot except an excuse for them to wake up with their clothes off in a strange bed and scream.  \n\n\nOh, yeah, my other least fav trope: waking up in someone else's bed/next to them and immediately screaming. Why? No one would react this way and it ruins any actually emotionally hard-hitting or even comedic tension/confusion the characters could be feeling. I hate it especially because there really IS great potential for 'waking up in a strange place/not knowing what happened last night/with a person i wouldn't normally end up here with' to drive some sort of genuine development but it is always just used for this really cheap ha ha laugh and then glossed over.   \n\n\nAlso I don't always hate this but I think shows need to cool it with the overuse of the 'character was pretending to sleep but actually heard everything' trope, it's gotten so common and overused I would be genuinely shocked now if a character ever actually WAS sleeping when something happened around them. With all the love kdramas have for misunderstandings why not let a character actually NOT magically overhear the other character's deepest thoughts every now and again, just to mix it up? Also how common is it for people to confess to/try to kiss/etc. sleeping people in reality?",

It doesn't even matter if they 'just slept', waking up next to someone you don't normally do sleepovers with is a vulnerable moment regardless and I wish it was treated as such more often.",

I have seen a couple shows like Melancholia where 'inappropriate relationships' were treated with  adequate seriousness and consequences were depicted, but there's so many shows (cough looking at you Doctors) where it's shown as basically unproblematic as long as one of the characters is 19ish when they get together with a 45 year old. There was a show like this with Krystal and Rain, and I think it was more common in older kdramas. High School King of Savvy was similar but with the older female trope and added gross-out factor of the ML being a literal highschooler. I just don't get what people enjoy about this, and it can also happen when the age gap between characters is supposed to be small but the actors' ages are visibly way too far apart.  \n\n\nSomewhat related to this, I don't like shows with a Pygmalion kind of plotline where the male lead (again, usually older) 'fixes' the female lead in some way. Birth of a Beauty was the worst and most off-color example of this I can think of but even when it's not as egregious, I don't like it when a show has such an obvious power imbalance and it's romanticized. 'Stern boss' shows where the stern boss teaches incompetent FL how to be smart and good at her job also fall under this trope for me.  \n\n\nThere is a variant of this which is extremely common in Chinese dramas where the characters 'grow up together' and the airheaded FL wants to go to the same fancy college as her crush so he basically forces her to study and tutors her until she gets accepted. I don't ALWAYS mind this plot but whenever it comes from one character really 'admiring' the other and the other being 'perfect and smart and stoic' I hate it. Playful Kiss was the kdrama version of this on steroids and I hated every minute of it.",

I'll even include not-exactly-crime dramas like Sisyphus in this, it just feels like after some successful shows of this type 5-ish years ago everyone is endlessly trying to recreate the hype of Signal and almost all of them are failing. They rarely make logical sense, there are usually plenty of gaping plotholes, and it seems like viewers get angry about these shows more often than not (Alice, lol).   \n\n\nTo a lesser extent I think 'ghost solving mysteries' is also overplayed but it seems to suffer less from the egregious plotholes and logical inconsistencies so I give it more of a pass. There were also some good ones recently like From Now on, Showtime!  \n\n\nTo me it just seems like a sign of lazy writing that no one seems capable of writing a compelling mystery or crime plot without supernatural elements that conveniently 'solve' all the difficulties of normally finding clues and investigating them. As a viewer I also feel cheated when I find out there was no way I could have worked out the clues for myself even if I'd tried, because it all depends on some gimmick that wasn't fully revealed to the viewer until near the end.  \n\n\nHonorable mention in crime genre goes to Noble/Upright Psychopath shows, another trope I'm starting to find really exhausting though it hasn't been done to death quite as much.",

            "comment": "I hate the idiotic breakup trope too but for me, the worst one is the childhood connection trope.\n\nSometimes, it makes sense for the leads to have a childhood connection backstory if it's connected to the plot, like in What's Wrong with Secretary Kim or It's Okay to Not Be Okay. But, in many dramas, the leads didn't need to have a childhood connection. But still, we see flashback to some random meeting the ML and FL had when they were kids. \n\nIt's so unrealistic and I don't understand what the writer is trying to imply. Can't two people that meet when they are adults fall in love naturally? Do they have to have a childhood connection to justify why they are 'meant to be'? Ughh this trope is so dumb.",

            "comment": "Why is my favourite trope getting so much hate? \ud83d\ude2dThe separation trope for me seems necessary since I\u2019ve always thought of it as a time of introspection, a time to be with oneself without the influence of a romantic partner. For this reason I\u2019m a big fan of it. I do have to agree though that the separation in This is my first life was unnecessary, and did not add anything to the plot. Our Beloved Summer, in comparison, the separation seemed necessary since the leads needed to grow and like themselves as individuals so as to be able to sustain a healthy, loving relationship.\n\nMy least favourite trope is the tragic death of the only caregiver, and usually the kindest and most caring character, that the ML/FL have to push the plot forward or not. I want justice for all the grandmas, granddads and parents that have been killed or died in dramas when they didn\u2019t deserve to.",

Well, here is this trope plus some tropes similar to it.\n\n**First**\n\nFL: \"I need to tell you something, it's urgent\".\n\nML: \"Don't worry, it can wait. I'll come back soon\".\n\nMe: \"No, it can't! Just wait a minute and listen to a woman who wants to save your ass. You just wasted time for a small talk, instead of listening to her\".\n\n**Second**\n\nSome character tries to open the important truth but no one believes/wants to listen to them, thinking they are wrong.\n\n**Third**\n\nCharacters need to share something important but in person. And of course get hurt/killed before getting to the place. Meanwhile phones and the Internet: am I a joke to you???\n\n**Fourth**\n\nMostly relevant to crime/thriller/legal dramas: I'm going to go to really dangerous place without letting anyone know. What a good idea for the night!\n\n**Fifth**\n\nML warns FL not to do something, she does exact opposite. ML has to save her\r\n\nIt can be applied to any character who makes dumb actions after being warned not to do it",

Then they expect to get back together immediately on their return. Honestly I'm just furious at the audacity! At that stage i want the ghosted one to just get with the SL.",

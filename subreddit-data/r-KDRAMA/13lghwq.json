    "postText": "Welcome to our **Spotlight On** post series where you can share your picks of dramas that deserve the spotlight! Each **Spotlight On** post is focused on a genre or theme, as you can see in the post title. Based on this genre/theme, you are welcome to share your views about dramas you have watched that fit the topic of this post, which is:\n\n**Makjang**\n\nMakjang dramas (\ub9c9\uc7a5 \ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8): A drama that is difficult to understand or accept based on common sense and moral standards of an average person. These dramas will often feature things such as forced situations/settings, tangled relationships, affairs, and birth secrets. Other hallmarks of makjang dramas include switched identities, revenge plots, power struggles, death (lots of it, especially due to murder), incest (often shown as undertones rather than real relationships), amnesia, blackmail, and evil rich people.\n\nThe word makjang (\ub9c9\uc7a5) is actually not an officially recognized word but rather a non-standard form of the word kkeutjang (\ub05d\uc7a5) (noun), which means the end or the conclusion (such as death or complete failure). In popular culture, the term *makjang* is used to represent the idea of having reached the extreme. In the context of dramas, *makjang* can refer to stylistic, tonal, or narrative elements in dramas that chooses to play up the outrageous and extreme in otherwise normal dramas or to the genre of dramas characterized by these outrageous and extreme elements. For more information, see the post [Makjang 101: Taking Things To The Extreme](/r/KDRAMA/comments/kyvhxb/makjang_101_taking_things_to_the_extreme/) for more information and explanation.\n\nYou are invited to share short (or long) reviews of dramas you have watched that fit the topic of this post and an explanation of why you think the drama deserves the spotlight, including whether you would recommend the drama or not.\n\nOur suggested format/structure for comments is:\n\n**Drama Name**\n\n* **Good Things**: about the drama, \n\n* **Bad Things**: about the drama\n\n* **Interesting Things**: about the drama\n\n* **Spotlight On Because**: explain why you think the drama deserves the spotlight, including whether you would recommend the drama or not.\n\nWe strongly encourage you to share your MDL profile so that others can compare their tastes with yours to get a better understanding of preferences and dislikes, which will help in understanding if the feedback provided is applicable for them.\n\nPlease remember that every individual watching goes in with their own life experiences and biases so not everyone will see the drama in the same light or enjoy it in the same way.\n\n**Just because someone did not enjoy a drama that you loved is not a slight against you as a person.**\n\nWhen participating in this discussion please remember that whilst dramas do not have feelings, human beings do. ***Be kind to one another.***\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or anything you think should be redacted.** If you are using Markdown and not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

            "comment": "So I decided randomly to watch **Pandora: Beneath the Paradise** on Hulu. In the states, up to Episode 12 has been released, and I would be absolutely fine if the show ended with #12!\n\nI don't generally watch makjangs because of how upset they make me. When people make ridiculous immoral decisions, it super frustrates me and I have trouble enjoying.\n\nI will say this: like most makjangs, **Pandora** is never boring. It zips through every tick of the clock -- amnesia, child assassins, everybody meeting as kids, chaebol, politics, bad dads, comas, weird technology, infidelity -- and there is zero moral center.\n\n**Good Things.** The cast is incredible. Lee Ji-ah as Hong Tae-ra, the FL; Lee Sang-yoon as her husband, Pyo Jae-hyun; Jang Hee-jin (Ko Hae-su, or Kaesoo in the subtitles) as the world's worst broadcast journalist; Kwon Hyun Bin (Cha Pil-seung); Park Ki-woong (Jang Do-jin, my second favorite character); Han Soo-yeon (Hong Yura); and the goddess Shim So-Young (Kim Seon-deok, doing a toned down version of her maniacal Madame Lim from **Taxi Driver**). There's even favorite character actors like Ahn Nae-sang (Jang Geum-mo), who I last saw in **My Country: The New Age** being a complete evil jerk! And Jung Jae-sung (Han Kyung-rok), last seen in every show being a complete evil jerk! Just kidding, but the subtlety Mr. Jung delivered as the Warden in **Big Mouth** is nowhere to be found in **Pandora**; Mr. Han is just a straight-up jerk.\n\n**Bad Things.** Like I mentioned, the ethical inconsistency of makjangs makes me itchy, and **Pandora** is nothing if not inconsistent. Be prepared for the characters to make the worst decisions ever. The single most ethically and emotionally consistent character is Jang Dojin (Park Ki-woong), and even he is shown cheating on his wife, Kaesoo, in the first episode (cheating with his best friend's wife's sister, Yura, because of course). Okay, maybe the little kids are consistent. If this doesn't bother you, strap in for a heck of a ride!\n\n**Interesting Things.** Two things I found compelling were that in any mainstream revenge drama, Pyo Jae-hyun (Lee Sang-yoon) would be the hero. Tragic circumstances in his childhood, he parlays his charm and intelligence into being a powerful figure ready to run for President while also simultaneously launching a med tech product that's revolutionary! I've been hate-watching this drama in the hopes that some kind of switch flips and Mr. Pyo wins everything!\n\nThe other thing I find interesting is the inversion of a classic trope: the intrepid reporter. You know when you're watching a thriller and one of the leads will see a news report or a clue, and they look stunned and then say to themselves, \"So-and-so is really the killer!\" and then they go try to catch the killer by exposing them? Yeah, picture that, but with Kaesoo (Jang Hee-jin) as the reporter and every time she sees a clue, she says to herself \"Here is a conclusion!\" and her conclusions *are always super wrong.* It could be a drinking game! Watch Kaesoo see a clue! Get your drink ready! Drink as soon as she jumps to the wrong conclusion! Watch her destroy relationships and families based on whatever crackpot theory she invented in her head! \n\nIf you're going into journalism, don't do any of that. Just my advice.\n\n**Spotlight On Because.** I think it's a pretty good example of the mess that makjangs can become. There are sci fi elements for no reason, like the medical tech that is sort of like the Matrix where it can let a chimpanzee beat a bunch of top ranked e-gamers by downloading skills to her brain, but it's still in beta test but they're doing live demos? There's also the brainwashed army of child assassins! Because... of course?\n\nI seriously want to stop at Episode 12, but I have to keep watching! It's addictive!",

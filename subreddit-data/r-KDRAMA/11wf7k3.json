Oh, how will this story unfold! \n\nChoi Cheol Woong's life isn't easy and he has his occasional good side but he kinda just  seems like an asshole to me. Story better try harder to make me root for him.  \n\nWhen Doo Hak had that scene with his father about &gt;!whose fault it is that his life is what it is....!&lt; I know Doo Hak made his decisions and has responsibility too but the whole time Doo Hak was speaking, I was like &gt;!\"F yes! That's right! You tell him! It's ALL your fault! You did this s\\*\\*\\* to your son! You have no right to give Doo Hak crap!\"!&lt; It was so satisfying. His dad seems to have right morals but are they right morals or just worthless insidious pride? Because the people who suffer the most are those who should be able to rely on the dad, and the only ones who benefit are the dad with his unnecessary ego about doing the right thing and the people who don't need his sacrifice to survive. Talk about making other people, the ones you should be cherishing and protecting, feel insignificant.",

            "comment": "To me the main villain in this story is still DH and CCW's father. It seems like most of the problems revolving around Doo Hak and Cheol Woong are centered with him. Not only did he &gt;!tell Doo Hak to drop out of school and take the blame for a murder, but he also made his wife give up her newborn son to Cheol Woong's parents???!&lt; And for what? I'm completely baffled at his behavior. It was incredibly cathartic to see Doo Hak yell at him.\n\nI can appreciate Cheol Woong's character in that he seems to have been consistantly commited to the student groups protesting against the gvt, and he's always tried to be loyal if not for the &gt;!Intelligence service torturing him and harrassing him to give out information.!&lt;But that also makes his character very confusing, because it contrasts a lot with how he treats Doo Hak. It's strange to me that he shows this loyalty to his peers, but not Doo Hak, when Doo Hak has literally sacrificed most of the good things in his life to give way to Cheol Woong. I guess you could say that he continues to act out towards him and be flippant out of guilt, but it doesn't even come off that way. He just seems like an \\*ssh\\*le who lives in willfull ignorance, and for that reason his character continues to annoy me. \n\nOn the note of Cheol Woong, I strongly dislike how he continues to refer to Jung Shin like a piece of property, which she rightfully pointed out &gt;!at that stupid dinner that he arranged.!&lt; The way he says, \"&gt;!I'm going to make her my woman\"!&lt; multiple times just gives me the major ick. Maybe you can attribute that to the times? Idk.",

Most of the problems were caused by his decisions made years ago. \n\nCCW has always had resentment but what really set it in stone was the fact that since the beginning of meeting JS, JS had eyes only for DW. \n\nThe way CCW objectifies JS \u201cmaking her his woman\u201d that exists even today. It\u2019s guys in real life like him that have that mentality. When JS told him that she spent the night at DW\u2019s home, this dude actually tried to pry to see if they smashed. What a turn off that was for JS. I hate using these terms in labeling people but he has beta male behavior.",

I understand it\u2019s hard for him to process the fact that he murdered someone and it\u2019s even worse when someone other than yourself knows about the worst thing you did but wow. His treatment to Doo Hak is so upsetting. He succeeded in manipulating DK to thinking he\u2019s an accomplice of what happened. It\u2019s just hard for me to like him because your friend sacrificed 5 years of his precious youth in prison being punished for something that YOU did. Does he not see how good of a friend AND person he is by doing that for him? Instead of returning the favour, he manipulates him and makes him feel like a bad person. On top of that, he is so greedy and tries to take the only good thing DK has in his life which are his feelings for Jung Shin. CW is so selfish. DK has nothing because of his record and lack of education. !&lt; CW is just too selfish. I can\u2019t sympathize. \n\nI\u2019m honestly so happy with how Jung Shin stands her ground with CW and confidently asserts her feelings for DK. It\u2019s refreshing.",

I get that  motivations can be complex, but nothing about these characters is plausible. If these characters were better written, it could be a masterpiece, but we don't get enough sense of their inner life or character development. And their actions are inconsistent. CW started out as a decent character who had some honorable intentions,  but now he's just a villain? If he's such a horrible guy, why did he suffer waterboarding instead of ratting out his compatriots? That is not the behavior of a selfish person. I don't care about Doo Hak. I find his virtuousness boring and he has all the charisma of a piece of cardboard. I suppose All Will Be Revealed but the show is not making me care about these characters. I can't stick around for writing this bad, especially when there are so many other great dramas out there. It's a shame because I think CYW is a good actor. I hope he finds something better next time.",

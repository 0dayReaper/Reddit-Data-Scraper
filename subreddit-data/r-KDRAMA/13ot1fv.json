    "postText": "\nI just finished watching 25 21 yesterday. Have a lot to say about it.This was the 5th kdrama i've watched so needless to say, I am fairly new to the world of kdramas.\n\nI decided on watching 25 21 based on someone's comment on a post on this sub asking people their top 10 kdramas. Quite a few people had put 25 21 on their list saying that the characters were amazing and that the story was close to their heart. Based on their other picks I thought this would be a romance based drama but it was not that at all.\n\nAccording to me this drama was so much more than that. This drama is an ode to one's youth and  the uncertainty , the lack of understanding and the excitement that comes during that time of one's life.\n\nNow I am only 20 years old so I couldn't help but compare what happened and is happening in my life to the characters of this show.\n\nFrom the first episode we are introduced to Hee-do\u2019s one true love , fencing and the passion and drive she possesses for the same. Seeing that made me really admire Hee do and made me wish that I had put more faith in myself and my passion during earlier years of my life.The way she tried everything she possibly could to transfer to a new school , just so she could fence was very moving to see. To see someone having that much faith in themselves while everyone around them(including their mother) is telling them to give up motivated me to have that much faith in myself and my dreams.\n\nSeeing Beck Yi-Jin\u2019s resolve to become something so that he could bring his family back together resonated with me quite a lot as I am going through something similar myself.\n\nFrom a story writing point of view Hee-do and Yi-jin\u2019s character complimented each other perfectly. The way Na Hee-do was so focused on her dream and always dreamed high and on the other hand how Yi-Jin says that even if u achieve your dream that doesn't mean you are successful and having a dream is not everything created a perfect balance when they were together. Hee do taught Ye-Jin to dream while Ye-Jin was there to remind Hee do that true happiness comes from other things in life. They made each other work perfectly.\n\nThis show truly showed what a perfect healthy friendship is like. Even though they didn't end up together, the impact they had on each other\u2019s life is something that both of them will never forget.\n\nA lot of people did not like the ending but for me this kdrama had the most special ending out of all the kdramas i've watched(namely Our Beloved Summer, Summer Strike, Business Proposal and What's Wrong With Secretary Kim).The whole kdrama showed me that even if two people don't end up together that doesn't mean that the time they spent together was a waste on the other hand sometimes the people who we don't end up with might have the greatest impact on us as human beings and that we should not strive for forever but rather we should strive to be an important part of a person\u2019s life and help them grow to be better people.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't read too much into this but I like takeaways like this which might help me in life.\n\nThere is a lot more to say about this drama like how Moon Jiwoong taught that you shouldn't stress too much and just believe in yourself,Ko Yurim showed me that life will throw a lot of things in your way and as long as you keep the right people close, you will end up just fine(also it\u2019s always better to talk about things rather than keep than inside and let them ruin your relationships with people.).\n\nThe comedic aspect of the show , the way the lines were delivered and written, the cinematography,the osts,the chemistry of the characters and the deep sense of nostalgia which translated so well that I felt excited for when i get older and will think about my youth ,all of these things made me love this show quite a lot.\n\nAll in all I loved this drama a lot and I feel like I will come back to it to either reflect or figure things out in my life very often.\n\nIf you have read this far thankyou so much for doing that . I'm sorry if this was all over the place and lacked direction . This is my first time writing and posting something like this.",

I often see people with regret for having spent part of their time with someone who is no longer in their life because the relationship ended. Unless these people have proven to be a let down, we have to be grateful that they were once part of our lives. It didn't last forever, but it doesn't mean it was bad or a waste of time. They had impact on our lives, left good memories and taught us something. We should cherish their happiness :). Think this was a valuable lesson to take from the tvshow.",

It also enables you to quote each drama and put the status of each one (completed, watching, dropped, plan to watch...). With this info you will have access to a list with your entries that you can share while asking for recs here. \n\nAs you are starting to watch dramas, I suggest you to create your list of watched (and dropped) asian dramas and films (with your quotation for each one) in the site \u201dmydramalist.com\u201d. Next time when you ask for recommendations, you can share your list and other users will be able to understand your tastes and know what you have already watched. Besides it will be useful to you as time passes because we forget easily, specially when the number of watched movies increases. \n\nBelieve that after some time it is impossible to write in a post everything you have watched. \n\nThis site also contains lots of information about the majority of asian dramas released. If you decide to use this system, the earlier you start the better. \n\nMDL has also lots of useful information about each drama. You should take a look because it is amazing, like for each drama the users reviews or recommendations of a similar drama. \n\n\u25cf\u25cb\u25cf\u25cb\u25cf\u25cb\u25cf\u25cb\u25cf\u25cb\n\nThe way most people do is the following but maybe it is too complicated to start when you have already watched lots of dramas.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0eFirst you have to sign up for an account in MDL, if you have never done it.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0eThen you log in.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0eAs you are connected you search for a drama you have watched , for instance **Healer**.\n\n\nMethod 1: \n\n\u25aa\ufe0eYou go to **Healer**'s page on MDL\n\n\u25aa\ufe0eBelow the Title **Healer** and beside its cover  picture you shall see the average rating of the drama (8,9) and 5 white stars. If you click on the starts a new window will pop out and then you will be able to give your rating and record the status of the drama (watching, completed, on hold, dropped....).\n\nThe ideal is to make this process when you are new to dramas because it takes some time and requires a good memory. \n\n\nMethod 2 (faster, by b-k-dramatik):\n\n Once you search for the drama name and see it in a list of options, you can click the + sign next to the title, which brings up the same window with rating options and watch status. That's one click less for the same result, and if you're adding a lot at once that might save some time.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0eOnce you have input all the dramas, you will have a data basis ready to share with all this info.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0eIn order to access it, you might click in the icon of your ID on the top and on the right (the one besides the search symbol and a bell) and go to \u201dmy watchlist\". \n\n\u25aa\ufe0eYou will have something like this: https://mydramalist.com/dramalist/8902425 (my personal",

Despite that, Tae-ri is just so damn great as an actress that I really enjoyed the show overall and I liked all the fencing stuff. Na Hee Do is one of the best characters I've seen.",

I hated Ko-Yurim and the mother and it was mostly about training and her having these awful relationships. Then starting episode 9, it all of a sudden changes and it felt like it was a whole different show. Did anyone else notice that switch?",

She chose to take her own life (after YJS gave her the means to do it) so that her brother wouldn't be a runaway all his life. But honestly, this only destroyed Han Soo more. I wonder, will he go through with his suicide attempt and somehow survive or will his friend stop him in time?? Cause he looks more or less ok in the trailer of the 15th episode.\n\nThe King is TRASH.\ud83d\ude21 I hope he gets deposed or whatever, he's been weak all his life and he decided to show his kingly power just to kill this poor soul. HE FREAKING MADE HAN SOO READ THE DEATH SENTENCE!!! What was the point of that??? Why the cruelty??? \n\nI gotta give it to the Princess. She was willing to get deposed and punished in order to save Eun Soo. But now she's sick because of what happened and the trailer shows that her sickness quite serious if she's bleeding from the mouth. If she does die too, Han Soo will completely lose any left will to live. He's tired of seeing everyone around him die. Those words he said to the Princess about them waiting for each other and being together in another life if it's not meant to be in this life... They sound pretty damn ominous to me.\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\n\nI love how Ji-Sun resigned in front of the King and  left the meeting without even talking to him, showing him his back and disappointment. \ud83d\udc4c\n\nOne thing I didn't understand... WHY did the Princess tell him to get on with the marriage??? Why now?? \ud83e\udd14",

I can see why the king, who has had a lonely existence so far with few friends, would be so angry with Han Soo but that doesn't make it right to force Han Soo to read the verdict. It has been a complex drama with complex characters with all sorts of motivations.",

                    "comment": "I am hoping it's all a ruse. The reason the king had him read it is because there was a note that's like \"meet me later I got a plan\" and the whole suicide thing is fake because she knows about all the dirty secrets of the court and can now move around and gather the evidence cause they all think she's dead.\n\nNotice how the ones that were with her were Dong and her brother and Young Yoo, all people that are trying to save her.\n\nYoung Yoo would make sure Old Man Yoo knew she was dead. Han Soo bribing the merchant before it happened to help her escape would further convince Old Man Yoo it was real because the merchant is his man so he would report it. Everything would look real and convincing.\n\nNo one was there when Han Soo buried his sister and that wasn't explicitly shown. She was \"dead\" and then there was a grave he was crying by. We know he can act. Him acting drunk and crazy makes it convincing too and like he's given up so everyone will let their guard down.\n\nI think Young Yoo resigning was fake too. At least that was the moment I became the most suspicious because if I can't root for the King who am I supposed to be rooting for to run this kingdom? I think the king and Young Yoo had this planned out because daddy wouldn't want Young Yoo to quit like that and it's part of some plan. There's no way the king would so willing put corrupt men back in place and also give Old Man Yoo his men back without some plan... right?",

Dohwan is one of the actors that gets really immersed in his emotions, thats why his kiss scenes are so intense hehe. Unfortunately hes often paired up with actresses who are idols who dont have that much experience or shy when it comes to intense romance scenes.. its kinda weird though, i saw bona had some kiss scenes in other dramas and she was ok there. !&lt;",

Minister Yoo had Eunsoo spy on even his allies.

Admittedly, it would mean the Eun Soo plotline wouldn't have happened, and she might have been saved. Could it be that the writers are stoking us viewers up so much that we're literally screaming for Minister Yoo's ending to be as slow and as painful as possible?",

You can ask questions about **legal** streaming services or share experiences you have had while using a legal streaming service, including your thoughts about subtitle quality. Remember to include your region so people with personal knowledge of user experience in that region can answer you! *Note:* If you need technical assistance, please reach out to the customer service of your legal streaming service.\n\n**How To Find A Streaming Source For A Specific Drama**\n\n* ***Drama Profile on MyDramaList (MDL):*** Drama profiles on [MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/) may provide information about where certain dramas can be streamed.

It makes me a bit hesitant to go with them - I don't mind paying a reasonable subscription (and I have a firewall that blocks ads and makes it hard to go free-with-ads). But I don't like not being able to trust a service to charge fairly and be reliable.  They do seem to have a lot of the shows I'd want to watch though.  \n\nThoughts? Suggestions?",

The only payment complaints I've seen about Viki are when people have been doing subscriptions via a third party platform (a while back, getting it through Google Play seemed to garner lots of complaints but it wasn't for the USA market though, it was India &amp; Europe iirc).\n\niQIYI on the other hand, we see complaints about their billing system quite often. Actually, when I first read your comment, I totally thought you were talking about iQIYI and not Viki.",

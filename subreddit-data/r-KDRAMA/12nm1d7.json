Although I assume you're older (I was only *born* a few years after **JSA**, although I *love* that movie) it's interesting to see how generations can be so similar. \n\nIt was the same case for me too. Korean film and TV shows just kinda have this emotional rawness that's hard to see in Western media. The Korean film scene is so young, heck the country is too, that they're still evolving. Even \"Western style\" movies like **JSA**, or recently **Hunt**, don't compare to the flashiness of Hollywood. Both movies are still rooting in the emotional connection between the characters emotional development and the audience watching. Hollywood has made so many movies at this point that they're running out of stories to tell. They've explored every type of human connection, from romance, family,.friendship, abuse, hatred, and more. And although there is still media that can tell these stories well, like **Gravity Falls**, it's a rarity nowdays. Meanwhile Korea still has a lot more to tell. \n\nAn interesting thing is I think this emotional connection is why Hallyu was so strong in SEA. You've got a young country whose been through war (like most SEA countries lol) yet still maintains the values of family and honor in it's media. Any Asian kid can atest to pressures of the culture, so when a romance drama has an arc where the mother doesn't approve, or the FL is a \"bad influence\" because she caused the MLs grades to drop, it's easier to emphasize and relate. Comparing that to Western romance shows where honestly, I can barley relate. Stories about hooking up, having this romantic meeting outside the country, being fwbs are more common in Western media (although now starting to appear in k dramas as well). Meanwhile a silly rom com about a girl forced to live with a celebrity (Shout out to **Full House**), although unrealistic, still maintains those conservative values present in Asian culture (she meets his parents, they go on dates, they don't do the deed like the first few weeks they meet).",

I was what, maybe like 8-9, when it first came out and I'd always loved decoding puzzles (my childhood dream was to be a spy) so naturally it was a hit. \n\nMy favorite memory has to be the community. I definitely shouldn't have done it (I was like 9 talking with people who were *wayy* older) but it was my first introduction into online fandoms and fan communities. The year after the show ended there was this huge worldwide fan hunt and I still have the journals from where my friends and I helped decode the puzzles. Even if I've moved past it, even the best kdramas can't come close to those memories (except **Mouse** where my friends and I held a bet on who the villain was, and I lost *badly*)",

Can't believe how easy it is to make even without a bamboo rolling mat. \n\nBtw, Jinny's Kitchen is a cooking-travel reality show that is centered around cranky boss Lee Seo-jin running a pop-up restaurant in Bacalar, Mexico, along with his fellow actors Jung Yumi, Park Seo-joon, Choi Woo-shik and BTS V. Certain scenes can be quite repetitive, and the only tension is whether customers will arrive and how busy the staff will be. Still, it's oddly satisfying to see famous celebs doing mundane tasks and interacting with the local people and tourists. Just take my advice and never watch it without eating first\u2014 or at least keeping your favourite ramyeon or k-snacks close by.",

            "comment": "Having just finished **Bulgasal: Immortal Souls**, which felt a lot like a vampire revenge fantasy, I picked a classic off my watch list and started **Blood** (2015), a medical drama about a vampire surgeon working to find a cure for vampirism while taking the vampiric equivalent of puberty blockers to tamp down his fang boner long enough to cut people open.\n\nThe cast is stacked (Ahn Jae-hyun is the lead, Ku Hye-Sun is the FL, and Ji Jin-hee is the prime antagonist), but I'm almost done with Episode 4 and I might have to nope out of continuing because it's another example of an FL that bothers me so much, I can't continue watching if I suspect the leads will get together romantically.\n\nI know it might just be me, but the FL is so entitled, unprofessional, and annoying that I want bad things to happen to her. Whenever vampires fall for annoying young mortals in drama, if the object of their affection is super useless and annoying, it just makes me think vampirism lowers someone's IQ.\n\nThis has happened to me twice before: once trying to watch **My Sassy Girl** (couldn't make it past ep 2). I watched the entirety of **Scholar Who Walks the Night**, and while it's one of my favorite schlocky kdrama horror/romances, I detest the FL so much I felt morally compromised by how much I enjoyed watching the character get subjected to that torture where they smush your legs with sticks (I'm still not sure how that works). Gwi shoulda ate you, girl.\n\nSince Ahn Jae-hyun went on to exhibit equally terrible taste in FLs in **Cinderella and the Four Knights** just the following year (Hye-ji is on my Top 10 Worst FLs list), I'm starting to wonder if I should just bookmark his entire filmography so I know what series to avoid!\n\nI will keep watching for the moment...",

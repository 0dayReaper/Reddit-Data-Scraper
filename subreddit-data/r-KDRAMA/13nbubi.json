But the jams and dried loquats are well worth it!\n\nI started the game variety show **Bloody Game** (S1) on a whim on Friday and have not been able to put it down, it's so interesting to watch. Makes me look forward to S2 a lot more than I ever anticipated.\n\nI've been thinking about my kdrama viewing habits for the first half of this year and I've been generally doing very light loads of watching, usually just one or two dramas at a time instead of five or six which is often how many I have going on concurrently. I chalk it up to both doing lots of rewatches (if I'm rewatching, it's a drama I was gripped by and likely would binge) and just a general lack of new dramas that really catch my interest. I guess this recent cycle of dramas has just not been very matched up to my taste/mood lately. On the good side though, that means I've been able to do a deep dive into k-variety shows and watch some shows that I otherwise wouldn't have time for and that's led to some great time.\n\nOverall, I think between last year and this year's early offerings, I'm just really *over* violence and have been watching stuff that lacks violence to balance things out. Part of it isn't even stuff I'm watching but just general fatigue of the topic of violence from moderating duties. I'm hoping that fluffy makjang^(think Bride of the Century) makes a comeback on the kdrama scene though since I can definitely use a new offering.",

I\u2019m only in my mid-20s but feel so old to do certain things that I couldn't do before due to my bad physical and mental health, but the fact that the main character is in her mid/late 40s starting residency again without asking anyone\u2019s permission or without seeking validation makes me feel so validated and so much better about myself. I know there's no right age or deadline, but I still feel this way about some things and so many dramas like this make me feel better about myself. \ud83d\ude0c",

It's about a young gay man in Seoul as he lives his regular life. I'm looking forward to how it will be adapted. It's also very short at only 200 pages. \n\nWhen I was at the library the other day, I saw a graphic novel I'd never heard of that sounds like the story of a Korean-Finnish adoption called Palimpsest. Don't know much about it but it looked interesting! Short novels and graphic novels/manga are really my speed these days! \n\nI also think Bora Deborah is the best romance drama that I've seen airing since Business Proposal. Yoo In-Na is just a fabulous actress!",

            "comment": "There was a five alarm fire in my city last week. An insulation foam sprayer caught on fire on the first floor of an apartment building that was under construction. Two of the construction workers died. The crane operator survived though - the firefighters rescued him from the top of the crane. He\u2019d tried to swing a basket to the two trapped workers before he came down. Firefighters tried to get to them too but they had to call a mayday for rescue themselves, and some bailed out of the high floors with ropes and hooks they keep in their uniforms. One of the men who was trapped tried getting on Facebook Live to get help.\n\nIt made the national news, and I made the mistake of reading some of the comments. It was in the area of town we call South Park, so people were joking about killing Kenny. Some people were determined to skew it to their cynical defensive world view, saying it was intentionally set for insurance or because people didn\u2019t want the apartments there or that it was related to their pet political issue somehow, or saying awful things about the man who tried to get help before he died, saying it was just for likes.\n\nIt reminded me to not take internet comments seriously, which I think is a good reminder for Reddit regulars like us. A lot of people don\u2019t think before they post or they don\u2019t bother to learn about a situation before commenting on it or they see it through their particular very narrow worldview. I will take it as a reminder to step back, not take comments seriously, and just let people be, because they aren\u2019t going to change.",

With several casting confirmations, I believe that business is going back to normal in kdrama land (and regrettably, casting fallouts also happen).\n\nAs much as I am interested on the story concept and character profiles, I always keep in mind to find the 'confirmed' status in every casting news. Based on my understanding, 'confirmed' means that the actors have already signed contracts on that certain project and had their filming schedules sorted out, so the next course of action is the actual filming. Even though how much I anticipate the pairing of the actors or how exciting the project sounds, without the 'confirmed' word (or still in the 'reviewing' process), I shouldn't put my hopes up as anything can still happen.\n\nPlease correct me if I am wrong on this interpretation.",

                    "comment": "Kdrama casting news (in Korean articles at least) typically consists of two rounds of 'confirmed' casting news:\n\n(1) Confirmation of having received an offer for the role and is (positively) considering it.\n\n(2) Confirmation that they have been casted in the role.\n\nAt stage (1) confirmation, it just means that they are in discussions. If the news mentions that they are 'positively considering' the role, then the casting *generally* ends up happening. (I'd give it a gut estimate of about 85% of the time.) If they say it's 'one of the roles they are considering', eventual confirmation happens slightly less often.\n\nAt stage (2) confirmation, the casting is generally set in stone but circumstances can result in casting changes. This happens most often when other aspects of production run into issues and scheduling conflicts occur so the actor/actress ends up pulling from the project. But yes, generally when you get this stage of confirmation, you can get your hopes and anticipation up, especially if casting news of supporting characters follows soon after.",

Now the first two episodes are rubbish to put it mildly but after that the drama gets so good.\n\n Overall the acting is average. What the drama does really well is explore human emotions and relationships. Friendships, relationships, finding one's place in the world, dreams, reality, college life are some of the themes explored in this drama. It's not super dramatic or full of mystery but more of a gentle study in the human condition. Conflict here is through confusing emotions, loyalties, uncertainties rather than good vs evil. Ending was satisfactory.\n\nThe first season is better than the second season, which is a bit more melodramatic. \n\nI relate hard with Oh Ga Rin. Kang Tae Ho is so different here to his character in Attorney woo. \n\nOverall I give it 8.5/10.",

            "comment": "Please convince me to keep watching *The Scent of a Woman (SOAW)*.\n\nI started this because I **absolutely loved** Kim Sun Ah's work in *My Name is Kim Sam Soon*, and  *SOAW* is also highly rated.\n\nI've watched two episodes now and I find it **melodramatic** and **boring**. Plus, the ML is not a good actor, and Kim Sun Ah looks so different and not as pretty in this (imho.) \n\nIs it worth it to keep watching?",

                    "comment": "I love this drama and I think it's worth continuing but with the knowledge that at times it gets really sad (though there are funny and heartwarming moments as well). Kim Sun Ah's performance is absolutely incredible, she rips your heart out as she struggles to accept that she has very little time left to live. Her doctor/the 2ML is also great and you may end up with second lead syndrome. The support cast at the FL's job and at the hospital are excellent and add a lot to the story, esp. the young patient who has a crush on her doctor. It's true that this drama isn't Lee Dong Wook's strongest performance but he is very pretty to look at and has great chemistry with KSA.",

I love Kim Sun Ah so finished the drama but the chemistry was lacking(yes, even the tango scene for me), hated her character &gt;!effectively deceiving the ML !&lt;  plus of course Im the rare someone who thinks Lee Dong Wook lacks acting prowess so all in all a blah watch. Sadly its Kim Sun Ah's most popular work after Kim Sam Soon, which is a tragedy because shes fantastic in many other great dramas.   \n\nwhew, that turned out to be a rant! Anyway, I think the only character i enjoyed was the second ML who shows character growth and has a sweet relationship with the FL.",

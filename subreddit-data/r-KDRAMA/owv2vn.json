Of coarse, it is a **generalization made for fun**, not to be taken seriously. However, I find it amusing how characters often change hairstyles when they change attitudes (ex.:easy to spot in Vincenzo). It reminds me of the [villain in Shrek 4](https://imgur.com/a/kJcIM31)\u00a0\u00a0 (Shrek Forever After) who changes wigs according to his mood. \n\nSource k-dramas (left to right, top to bottom): True Beauty,\u00a0 Mad for Each Other, Welcome to Waikiki, Psychopath Diary, Flower of Evil, Vincenzo, Start-up",

For example, in Hollywood, when a new creature (ex.: alien, monster, etc.) is introduced, the rule of thumb is that if it had big eyes that look like human eyes, it will be positive (E.T., Beauty and the Beast, Lilo and Stitch, District 9.... many, many more), if not, it will be an antagonist. Of coarse, there are exceptions (bunny in Zootropolis), but that are rare and usually that lack of correspondence represents a gimick in itself.",

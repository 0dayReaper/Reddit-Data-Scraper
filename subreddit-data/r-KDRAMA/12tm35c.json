            "comment": "**Divorce attorney shin**\n\nIf you like literary fictions, DAS has a similar touch. No intriguing plot, structure, tropes or dramatic portrayal, even ppls are hard to notice haha. A calming character driven drama that subtly uncovers a social theme through the story of a pianist turned lawyer, his random but relevant slice of life involving his friends and divorce clients. It is neither truly a law or slice of life drama, rather a character and theme based one that slightly involves law genre to talk about the theme of divorce (no suspenseful courtroom scenes; focus on the detailed backstories of the characters) and sol to highlight a corresponding theme of trust and understanding through friendship rather than involving married couples. \n\r\n**Good things:** The characters. They are quirky, fun and very real. The friendship/bromance is the best I have seen so far in any dramaland. Even the divorce clients have detailed characterization. The cases are substantial and analysis worthy unlike most other law dramas. It is a rare drama where filler scenes are equally good, sometimes even better! \r\n\r\n**Bad things:** None for me but some people might not like the slow, trope less, non-climactic storytelling and might get offended by the first two cases. Once again, **they did not glorify cheating rather repeatedly acknowledged the guilty as guilty and showed how the children of such families suffer most.** Also, the drama wasn't being partial to women rather the main theme of this drama was to explore the causes and effects of dysfunctional family and they were shown through flawed/nice characters irrespective of gender. The webtoon they adapted the divorce cases from actually consulted real lawyers so ignoring the obvious dramatization, they are very real. \r\n\r\n**Interesting things:** The screenwriter only used the divorce cases from the webtoon and created all the characters from scratch. The actors, esp Cho seung woo, added more details to their characters and brought them to life.\r\n\r\n**Spotlight on because:** The characters and natural acting. From main leads to supporting to extras- entire cast was brilliant. Csw played as a lawyer again but not a speck of resemblance from hwang simok was there in shin sung Han. His character analysis, attention to details and subtle acting was fantastic and as usual, worth watching for him only.\r\n\n**Verdict:** Solid YES! You will absolutely love the characters and the bromance. Almost everyone in the on-air discussion threads got envious of their friendship haha. It topped my all time favorites hospital Playlist and prison playbook from sol category. \n\nAs for the cases, I would say to watch the drama from the viewpoint of the characters and respect that not everyone has similar thoughts and integrity and process situations differently based on their personalities. **(9/10)**",

            "comment": "**Our Blues**\n\n* **Good Things**: There is a wonderful sense of community spirit in this series. The ensemble cast members aren't just portraying Jeju locals, they inhabit them. The landscape of Jeju becomes a character itself in the drama. The storylines build and ascend almost flawlessly. There are numerous moments that are relatable from daily life.\n* **Bad Things**: It gets off to a slow start, because the first storyline (Han-su and Eun-hui) is the weakest one.\n* **Interesting Things**: The slice-of-life moments depicting local life in Jeju, mostly revolving around the local market.\n* **Verdict**: This drama cannot be recommended highly enough, and it's a worthy nominee for Best Drama for this year's Baeksang Awards.",

            "comment": "Oasis\n\nGood: The premise is interesting and the plot is driven by choices embedded in Confucian ideology which is frustrating and fascinating. The actors are fabulous and have evoked emotion in me most episodes. What is a k drama if it doesn\u2019t give you the feels?\n\nBad: The editing stinks. The scene changes are strangely abrupt which isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve noticed before. The fighting scenes are amazing but the amount of brutality Doo Hak endures and then seemingly walks away from is a tad absurd. \n\nInteresting: The choices of the characters both good and bad make sense which I love. Cheol Woong\u2019s love for Jung Shin is palpable. &gt;!So is Jung Shin and Doo Hak\u2019s love for each other. I love this couple so much, and I especially love how solid the romance is.!&lt;\n\nVerdict: I would definitely recommend this drama if you want a bit of romance, intrigue, thuggery, and a good look at South Korea in the 80\u2019s. I\u2019ve come to love the characters, and though I\u2019m not sure what episode 15 &amp; 16 will entail, I\u2019m satisfied with the series that if the end stinks, I won\u2019t feel like I wasted time like I did with Interest of Love.",

            "comment": "**Forest**\n\n**Good Things** All the actors are good, with compelling chemistry between the leads. FL pushes back against ML whenever he\u2019s a jerk. Love triangle is resolved within a couple of episodes so does not become irritating. SML/SFL couple and their attraction for one another is adorable; he loves her quirky qualities that are annoying to others and his obvious joy is a pleasure to watch. Enjoyed the relationship between ML and his secretary (actor really brings the secretary character to life). The forest setting is beautiful. \n\n**Bad Things** ML is the stereotypical paternalistic dominating type; those who can\u2019t enjoy this character type be warned. He does soften up and FL pushes back on a lot of his BS, but still. FL has a couple of damsel in distress moments. Some pacing and minor plot issues keep this drama out of the top tier but still very good. \n\n**Interesting Things** Unique professions are portrayed (rural air rescue, forest protection) for a nice change of pace. Both FL and ML have childhood trauma and it seems like a setup for the awful \u201cshared childhood trauma connection\u201d trope, but it turns out they never met as children (hooray!). The rich characters (ML, SML\u2019s father) both started in horrible poverty rather than at least one coming from money, and SML\u2019s father is a dedicated single dad. \n\n**Verdict** Watch this drama! Worth a watch just for the setting and air rescue occupation. Both leads, ML in particular, experience change and growth in addition to the romance. It doesn\u2019t achieve the top tier of greatness but is very good and a solid drama. It will eventually be a rewatch for me.",

Within these discussion threads, you **must not include any discussion or spoilers** for episodes after the episode in question. Spoiler tags should be used for major plot spoilers within the episode. Individual episode discussion threads may be accessed through the links in this comment to prevent users seeing whole series spoilers. To participate in these threads reply to the comment \"Episode ...\" or another user's comment. Please report any comments that spoil later episodes using the custom report \"user has spoiled a later episode\" rather than the general \"unhidden spoiler\" report.\n\n**Whole series discussion:** General discussion of the series may be made as a direct reply to the post or a reply to another user's comment outside of the individual discussion threads.

The revenge was just so so satisfying because tbh dong geun didn't really even have to do that much. everyone in that friend group is a selflish narcissist, who only do things for their own benefit. it was so fun seeing their group break down from the inside, everyone being paranoid about each other and plotting against each other. yeonjin's punishment was by far the most satisfying. she has to rot in jail for the rest of her life with dong geun on her mind every single day and seeing her own mother in the same prison. that is just gold. i would have preferred both myeong o and jae jun to stay alive,  i get that myeong o's death was the key to incriminating yeon jin, but i think seon hee's death should have been enough to send her to prison, i would have much rather myeong o suffer in some other way. the age gap romance thing did grow on me towards the end, but i still feel iffy about it. not because of the age gap, but it just seemed like the guy was a total simp for her for no reason. !&lt;",

And perhaps that was the point- that under the slightest bit of pressure shitty people will turn on each other in the bat of an eye. But still. Dong-eun has been warning us that she\u2019s ready to go on a fucked up rampage and it ends up not being that bad. Pt 2 wasn\u2019t as torturous as I had hoped it would be.

                    "comment": "&gt;!Maybe Dong-Eun wanted to also have the reasonable doubt card to play? Thinking of everyone's comeuppance she provided the means for much of the revenge, but the people actually carrying out the murders/assaults/blinding were either the bullies, the son of her HS teacher, the dirty cop's criminal associates, or Do-Young with Jae-Joon. The detective investigating the murders seemed to suspect Dong-Eun was involved, but he also basically let it go.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I was surprised how the bully group didn't have many countermeasures against Dong-Eun. Yeon-Jin seemed to be the only one hitting back. Sa-Ra and Jae-Joon were both wealthy, but they barely even tried to investigate Dong-Eun even though they knew she was plotting against them. Not saying they'd work together since they barely trust each other, but they never hired their own private investigators, pulled favors with officials, etc.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I could see the writer going less tortuous with the revenge, so Dong-Eun's decision to continue living works more for the ending. Full on nuclear option revenge would likely lead to her dead or in prison, rather than helping others get their revenge happy endings.!&lt;\n\nEdited multiple times because spoiler tags are being stubborn.",

            "comment": "Finished ep 16! OBVIOUS SPOILERS! Here's my thoughts:\n\nOverall this was a very fun watch heavily carried by the acting performances. I especially applaud the entire gang of yeonjin, all five of them! Revenge stories are only fun if the villains are really good and you love to hate them.\n\n&gt;!As a big fan of lee dohyun, the writers completely wasted his talent. He was given such a weak character to portray, with a very unconvincing romance plotline. And his own revenge plotline was honestly uninteresting and dragged for so long! I mean cmon, yeah i get it yeojeong hated the serial killer but that's it? The writers didnt give us a compelling reason that he'd harbor vengeful feelings for years. Just the letters. Lame. Most of yeojeong's plotline was happening in his head. (Edit: If you've watched hundreds of shows across all media, movies, western shows, asian shows, anime, manga, a loved one being murdered in front of the protagonist inspiring revenge is a dime a dozen. The writers didnt give us anything unique and interesting besides the letters. There was no suspense since the guy was in prison waiting to be killed. If yeojeong was brave enough, he could have made his revenge without dongeun)!&lt;\n\n&gt;!On the other hand, kang ahjumma's plotline was my favorite. It is extremely unlikely that a random maid would develop spying skills but nonetheless it was all fun to watch! And I was heavily invested in her story, teared up a bit when the husband beat her savagely after her daughter fled.!&lt;\n\nLast comment. I think this is song hyekyo's masterpiece. And I watched full house, that winter the wind blows, DOTS, encounter, and now we are breaking up. Well tbh i still dont think she enters the upper echelon of korean actresses (ie kim hee-ae, seo hyunjin, kim soyeon, son yejin)\n\nOverall this was one of my favorite 2022-2023 dramas. Would highly recommend. Wish there were good OST songs but alas netflix budget and licensing crap...\n\n(Needed to edit several times for spoiler tags)",

Dongeun may have waited so long, but the intricate moves she did, as well knowing their weaknesses, set their epic downfall.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!It's also funny how one of the fan theories kind of came true to jaejun. His ending was well- deserved.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I'm glad that Doyoung's character focused so much not on his relationship to Dongeun, but on his role as a Father. It also showed how much he cares for yesol. He knows the best thing to do to protect Yesol from all the wrongdoings of yeonjin and jaejun, even when he had to do it himself. YESOL AND DOYOUNG DESERVE A HAPPY LIFE.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The scene with yeojeong's mom stopping dongeun was so powerful. It puts everything to perspective. Even when you are a victim, you deserve a chance to live a happy life. If you try to disappear, people will be sad because they will have someone gone from their lives. His mom is telling her that there's someone who cares for her and that she has a purpose in life.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!With this kind of drama, the ending will leave a great impact so Im grateful that Dongeun got a happy ending. It's like a letter to the ones who have experienced the same thing as her, that victims should speak out and need to be heard. They can also attain justice. It doesn't matter when it happened a long time ago when they have had that pain i flicted permanently intheir lives. They can move on and be loved. It shows positivity and hope to them.!&lt;\n\nI'm definitely gonna rewatch tomorrow to get the satisfaction of seeing the bullies' downfall \n\nI need to know Louis' wherabouts i need closure",

Seeing the downfall of Yeonjin gave me a deep personal pleasure. I've never seen such a psychotic bitch. Her \"romance\" with Jaejoon made me sick in my mouth. They were twisted and perverted childhood friends to lovers that was so disgusting to watch even though at the beginning we don't see the extent of Jj's crimes. I thought he was relatively the most ok one since he didn't actively participate in the bullying (boy was I mistaken). Finding out Jj was a rapist after all was just the cherry on top. \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22 Both their endings are so deserved. Watching them all destroy each other and not stick together was way more satisfying than Dongeun having to get her own hands dirty. The other 3 bullies also got fitting ends. Happy they finally buried Sohee too.\n\nEvery loose end was tied up so nicely, unrealistic but satisfying to watch. I only wish they showed Sera rotting in jail and Hyejong mute and alone. Otherwise, I got what I asked for. The romance was eh? I just thought the age difference was kinda visible and it made it icky for me. But, what girl doesn't want a guy like Yeojeong?",

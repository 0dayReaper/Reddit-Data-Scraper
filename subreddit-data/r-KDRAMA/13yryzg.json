Forgiving someone is actually a kind of freedom from the hurt they have given you.\n\nThe perfect end would be everyone forgiving all the people who have hurt them and setting ourselves free.\nWhat according to me would be the perfect ending\n\nDr Cha would probably take the liver from In Ho and Roy would be performing the surgery. But ofcourse she will divorce In Ho .\n\nSeung Hi will move to Stats with her daughter. \n\nFor the time being there would be no romantic involvements.",

            "comment": "In the end, Roy's role was only to create comedic scenes where he and In-Ho competed for the same woman.  Thinking back, he never contributed anything else to the plot, as Doctor Cha was more bemused by his attention than anything else.  I find that this was a bit of a disservice to the character.  He was dropped like an old sock in the last episode and his last scene was 10 seconds and felt like an afterthought.  Considering all the expectations we had I found that disappointing. I forgot somewhere along the way that he was a 2ML.\n\nApart from that I was happy with the ending.  I loved that Doctor Cha made a fulfilling life for herself by doing the things she loved.  She looked fulfilled and glad for her second chance at life.  I guess her wish to be in a loving relationship will stay a wish.  \n\nI liked In-Ho's end as well, especially the scene where he sits alone in his office, the youngest director ever, yet no one is there to celebrate.  This was his punishment for being a weak, selfish man.  Now he is atoning for his past mistakes by having the two women he wronged working him like a slave.  His mother finally had to learn to wash her own dishes.  \n\nLoved that scene with Seo Jeong Min and Jeon So Ra. It was so sweet and endearing.\n\nAll in all, not a bad drama.  It was entertaining enough, but won't rank anywhere in my top 10.  \n\nOn to the next!",

Can someone other than Dr. Roy tell her to focus on her own damn self and take better care?\n\nHow egocentric are these characters? As people are guessing, I think she won't choose either of them for the transplant. Maybe she's pointing towards the sky, signifying that she'll leave it in god's hands.\n\nAlso have a gut feeling that Dr. Cha may open her own clinic which might seem random lol, her divorce will get finalized therefore getting half the assets and she'll probably have an open ending with Dr. Roy, we won't see their ship getting sailed. \n\nHer writing the letters though seems to be foreshadowing something unfortunate, that's never a good thing.

I think this episode felt like such a reality check about what\u2019s important to her. I also think the undertones around mistakes, forgiveness, redemption mirror nicely as she considers that the life she\u2019s lived up to now (giving up her dream to be a doctor and becoming a housewife) isn\u2019t something to ever regret or fight against or punish herself for.",

And the things that made him proud and self involved was: 1. His job, 2. His wealth, 3.his children, 4. His wife, 5. His reputation, and even 6. His mistress. But the writers took each of those away except his job.  He has no wealth as he's in debt and his mom is in even greater debt.  His children hate him.  His wife is leaving him. And even his relationship with his mistress is over.  And now they are threatening his reputation thru his mom's debt. Brilliant. Didn't think of that. Granted how could we know she owed her friends money? Always thought it would be thru his affair but this route was a nice unexpected surprise. !&lt;\n\nI don't know how I want it to end but I do know I want it to end with Dr. Cha alive and living her best gd life. \n\nAlso in another comment someone mentioned Hyori making a cameo and now I want that so much.

For that matter - what is the purpose of the story between the two professors who are fighting all the time? Comic relief? The husband provides it. No need for more of the same.\n\nI feel that in many Korean dramas, the fact that there are 16 episodes (regularly as if you can't deviate from that format), there is a lot of content that could have been left on the editing floor.I recently saw the (old) series Oh My Venus and felt that it was 16 episodes that could have been an hour and a half movie or a maximum of six episodes series.\n\nAs for Doctor Cha, I also have no expectations about the ending. I am not disappointed with the series because it really showed the difficulty of dealing with such a situation in a relatively realistic way. They just sold it to us a little differently (the pan of returning to the profession and professional success) and less as a personal drama where the story of the divorce and the medical issue of the heroine took all the focus.",

And from the last scene between them (when he comes out of surgery) I felt that there is a relationship between them but it is based on equality and mutual respect and not like it was before. Maybe it's just me. Anyway I'm totally fine with that.\n\nRegarding Roy - I feel that the treatment his character received was completely wrong. They could have treated him as Doctor Cha's friend from the start and remain so in the end.But they treated his character as a romantic potential and devoted quite a few scenes to it only to throw it away at the end in the most misogynistic way.The difference between him and Doctor Cha is 3 years (according to the series she is 46 and he is 43) and she was portrayed as if she were a grandmother talking to a much younger man.The assumption that he must marry and have children is also archaic to me.\n\nI assume that Doctor Roy, who has been accompanying Doctor Cha for over a year, knows very well how old she is, what her family situation is and still developed feelings for her and was willing to enter into a relationship with her despite the difference in family status - so why does she decide for him? Think about it - if this dialogue came out of the mouth of a man towards a woman, everyone here would be upset and rightfully so. It also annoys me the other way around.

I\u2019m looking forward to more of their projects, I hope KBC gets casted in another comedy drama or movie. \n\nBye everyone! See you all in the next buzzworthy kdrama! \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",

The fact that we don't have another scene of the two of them upsets me. I wish they had the same cafe scene, with CJS implying she has no intention to start a romance right in the beginning so the confession doesnt happen, and they still remain as friends but with Roy moving on and then gets a gf. Their bonding was precious even if no romance is involved!&lt;",

She wasn't demanding, in fact, she often didn't come out of her room.  But I remember on one occasion I was sitting with her, and we were chatting.  It was over 40 years ago but I still remember.  She said that all her friends were long gone, and now she was just waiting to die.\n\nI think that was the point of this last patient.  It's not so much that she felt a burden to her family, although that was part of it.  But she was tired of living and was ready to go.  At 100 years old, she had earned that right.",

            "comment": "Man I have so many mixed emotions right now.\n\n\nFirst let's talk about the things I liked: \n\n&gt;!1. I'm so happy for Doctor Cha! She finally got what she wanted. A simple yet happy life filled with all the things she wanted to do. It's admirable that she finally learned to love and prioritise herself. The difference between 1st ep Cha Jong-suk and 16th ep Cha Jong-suk is noticeable with the difference in her smile. It now no longer feels forced.\n\n2. I'm lowkey glad that the actual divorce wasn't dramatic, over the top and revengeful. CJS had already gone through so much sh@t so it was a relief that it went down well. She had struggled and lost so much because of that marriage. \n\n3. The kids had gone through so much trauma because of the mistakes of their parents. Eun-seo and I-rang finally came to a truce. I'm on the fence with Eun-seo and the way she handled the things but then again she's just a teenager (not sidelining her faults of course) and has a lot to learn. She has finally realised that her mother doesn't need that man and is much happy with her life as a doctor. Her asking In-ho what kind of charm does he have that two great women fell for him was amazing. Like seriously what did they see in him?! I can understand CJS because of their situation but not Seung-hee at all.\nAlso I'm so glad that CJS told her that none of this was her fault. It was all because of the mistakes and terrible decisions made by tha adults around her.\n\n4. Jung-min and So-ra are so cute together. That's it. I just love them so much!\n\n5. Seung-hee finally got some sense knocked into her smart head. Yeah it took like 18 years but better be late than sorry I guess. She did deserve a better life for herself and Eun-seo but I had hoped that she was more remorseful towards CJS. \n\n6. I'm actually not sure about In-ho. I guess I'm a bit glad that he wasn't turned into a caricature and had some kind of depth (irrespective of the fact that it was like 2 cm) in his character. Kim Byung-chul truly carried Seo In-ho till the end. I felt pity for him that when he finally got all the things he wanted professionally his private life was completely torn. The scene where he enters his new office and imagines his (ex)wife and kids celebrating with him and being happy together and then cuts to him being all alone in the end is pitiful. He truly brought it to himself. His selfishness ruined three happy families. I truly feel sorry for Eun-seo that he never saw her as his daughter and never apologized for inflicting trauma onto her except for one flimsy dinner.\n\n7. CJS'S mom and Mi-hee rock! Yeah they had their flaws but it's lovely how much they supported her till the end.!&lt;\n\nNow let's come to the things I didn't liked:\n\n\n&gt;!1. What the heck was that plot with Dr Roy??? \nHis character was almost forgotten in the last episodes. He was there for 2 minutes and then he was gone. And what was his deal with his birth parents? It truly unnecessary and dragged the plotline. Like why doesn't the writers decide to have ONE adopted male lead NOT go through ends to find his birth parents and then be disappointed?!\n I was already predicting that Roy wouldn't be the endgame with CJS but the way they handled them was really pitiful. CJS saying no to his confession was totally understandable as she had just gone through a messy divorce and an awful relationship. But it was handled oh so terribly. And he didn't even appear in the last ep for like even 5 minutes. It felt like all the progression we had made in the last 5 eps went down the drain. Man what a lost opportunity. Roy Kimberly truly suffered from the Second-male-lead disease.\nI just hope that Min Woo-hyuk gets a lot of new roles after this drama (hopefully of a main lead with happy ending).\n\n2. It was too rushed and abrupt. The last 2 eps felt dragged. The sudden liver failure thing felt like the last minute project in school. So sudden and too short. The story wasn't tied too tightly and a few threads felt loose. \n\n3. I still don't get the entire In-ho's mother's plot. It felt like they were making something big with it but in the end it went nowhere. It was resolved way too quickly. Alas, she did in the end realised what an amazing daughter-in-law she had.!&lt;\n\n\nOverall I think the show was entertaining. It had its highs and lows but I wasn't bored. I will miss eagerly waiting for a new ep to drop every Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAnd k-dramaland please don't make another cheating drama for a while. I'm tired of watching the same story with different character name over and over again. Please bring something new to the table!",

Was there a chance his father forced his son to become a doctor? Inho's side of the family was quite interesting when the MIL mentioned HER MIL was responsible for the memorial service for Inho's father and before CJS took responsibility.

            "comment": "Someone said something that I agree with. The more I think and dwell on this series, the more I am dissatisfied.\n\nAs a 53 year old whose friends include singles, married with kids, divorcees, widowers and such, living your best life for a  Dr Cha could mean having financial independence, creating a thriving career, and loving yourself. You absolutely do not need a husband or partner to feel complete or to live your best life.  But the way this drama was set up made the ending nonsensical to me when it concluded that she only needs to love herself and not be love. Really, that is the point? Well, not good enough for me.\n\nEarly on in this series, we find Dr Cha yearning for affection and intimacy from her spouse bc they have spent the last several years in separate bedrooms, does it not?  We see her trying to entice him, right?  We even have a scene in which Dr Cha and her Bestie , the derm, talk  about their lack of \u201csex\u201d which leads me to conclude that both are somewhat dissatisfied in that department. And we also find out that when Dr cha and her husband were in med school their first encounter was explosive leading me to believe that dr Cha is no frigid person, inside of her is a sexual being! We also know that the current Dr In Ho is having a clandestine affair.  Thus the man is having all the physical affection and emotional intimacy and the female lead is having none of it.   Dr Cha and her bestie are indeed looking and seeking for intimacy and a mature relationship. Neither are in it.  \n\nFurthermore we know that Dr Cha is reduced to being everyone\u2019s servant in a way.  She also lacks finance independence and is working tirelessly with no respect and support.  She doesn\u2019t take care of herself. And in some way she lost her purpose. \n\nSo under this context,  I am glad they resolved her purpose in life, she found respect and she is making her own life choices but one key element of her well being was being loved, truly loved.   You can see how marrying someone only  because of one\u2019s pregnancy lowered her self esteem.  I am pretty sure she knew that it was not true love. And that her atonement for trapping someone was being the best wife she could be and relegating her emotional needs. \n\nSo when you introduce Dr Roy someone who loves her for who she is, someone who respects her, someone she may have some common interest with, someone who gives her attention and who never refrains from showing physical support and emotional support, it was odd to me that they did not during the three year time jump give them another chance. Why not?  What was his purpose?   Why setup their met cute in the beginning for them to throw it away?    And lastly, why tell the viewers being alone but independent and thriving in one\u2019s profession is the key to happiness?  That is more  than enough.  \n\nNo no no. \n\nIf this were a kdrama about an abused women trying to leave her husband, I could understand. If this was someone who was still looking for their purpose in life, I see that.  If this was someone who had a great love and their story was cut short, I could see the writer not wanting to suggest a need for romantic love. But this is someone who found her purpose, who left a horrible husband, who got a third chance on life, who actually met someone who loved them for them, why not? \n\nI don\u2019t need her to get married. \n\nI would have liked the writer to give the viewers a message of hope - that now anything is possible for her. That when you allow yourself to dream and dream big, you open yourself for any possibilities including a healthy relationship. When you love yourself, you can let others in.",

I hoped they would at least keep that dynamic but it seems strictly professional now and that makes me sad given all they\u2019ve shared outside of the patient-doctor bounds. I also didn\u2019t like their breakup; maybe if we had a glimpse of Roy wanting to be a father I would have accepted that response. The break up almost felt like a mother lecturing her child and I think that\u2019s a new dynamic I wasn\u2019t seeing/had never seen between them before. (Maybe if I go back it\u2019ll be clearer but \u2026) Beyond this, I would have actually liked to meet his girlfriend! Sure, they\u2019re creating distance from his character since he\u2019s not close to Dr.Cha anymore but I as an audience member am invested in the lives of everyone on the show!!&lt;\n\nBut, that said \u2026 Her and Min Hee are super close! I love seeing them together and it warms my heart. Their relationship is such a source of joy :) \n\nANYWAYS! I stand Dr. Cha and these past few weeks have been so fun !",

            "comment": "Sharing my thoughts below, putting spoiler warnings in case\n\n&gt;! I am happy dr cha divorced her husband haha \u2014 and honestly, in the beginning I didn\u2019t mind her not ending up w dr Roy as long as she was happy. While that is true, I ended up being a little sad over it\ud83e\udd72 I can see why the writers decided not to but still, sigh\u2026 i realised I would\u2019ve really liked to see how dr cha &amp; dr Roy romantic relationship would be like I guess. I really like their bond after all, and  after dr Roy said \u201churry up and come to me\u201d and how \u201che\u2019d wait for his chance\u201d GAH. I\u2019m sucker for those so lol. Ok but despite my personal feelings, as long as dr cha is happy, content and all\u2026 all is well :) !&lt;\n\n&gt;! Other than that, there are some side characters I wished they paid more attention to? Or had more scenes? I\u2019d love to have seen sibling interactions between Jung-min and I-rang\u2014 or even better, the two of them and Eun-Seo. Idk, I just think them interacting would\u2019ve been interesting given all the family drama. Other than that, I do like how they portrayed in-ho crying behind his car in ep 15 in regret. I\u2019ve seen some people say that they didn\u2019t like how he was made to look sympathetic just so we could support him or wtvr, but tbh idr see it that way. I think it\u2019s just in-Ho having a deep realisation of all the bad things he done that he regrets deeply. And I think the epiphany was nicely done. Aside from that, despite all the bad he has done, it\u2019s nice to see there\u2019s still some amicability between him and dr cha as parents of their children haha. Though, am glad they are divorced :) !&lt;\n\n&gt;! Also, wished there were more serious interactions between sora and Jung-min. I feel like after the \u201cI\u2019ll stay by your side\u201d moment, they never really had anymore serious scenes? I know this show is meant to be slightly comedic but still\u2026 I thought their make-out scene was so out of place lol esp since jung-min was going thru smth still (i.e. the make out scene being the one in the ep where dr cha caught them making out lol) like ya, it\u2019s comedic but still\u2026 would be nice to see sora progressively trying to be a better talker/comforter or explore her character more. But again, this is just my opinion. And sora isn\u2019t a main character so haish, only so much can be done !&lt;\n\n&gt;! All in all, overall, I did like the drama esp during the volunteer excursion arc. Oh and almost forgot\u2014 I loved how dr cha grew out her hair in the end hehe. Oki, moving on\u2026 Now that it\u2019s over\u2026 idk what to watch or look forward to anymore on my weekends lol. Oh wellll, gna miss this drama haha !&lt;",

But it didn\u2019t feel satisfying as a viewer because I was so emotionally invested in her husband going down. Nothing happened to him except a divorce and a promotion. After all of that emotional abuse, he got promoted?!? The writers really needed a terminal reason for the divorce to actually happen. I can\u2019t believe that they actually redeemed him. It\u2019s awful.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I want to know what happened to the MIL\u2019s debts. She didn\u2019t get what was coming. So what? She\u2019s stuck doing household chores? That\u2019s it?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Why did this show go easy on all the crappy characters but didn\u2019t give the kids better character development and endings? They were the true innocent parties.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I loathe that line from doctor cha saying it was nice that they gave her the building with the loans on it. Wtf.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Unpopular opinion but I felt like viewers, the best friends, and Inho pushed the idea of Dr Roy and Doctor Cha being together more than the two characters did. I never bought into it. I just never felt it. Maybe it was also a chemistry thing. But the ending worked out better for those two imo. It would\u2019ve felt forced if they ended up in a relationship. They were always just professionals and just friends. Glad it stayed that way.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!This show was not it for me. It baited me into thinking there was going to be more than it turned out to be.!&lt;",

They tried to make us pity the mistress who not only had the audacity to have an affair with a married man  but had a child too from the cheater. They tried to turn both cheaters into saints at the end. \nThe writer added comedy at the most tragic places. They dangled a handsome second lead in front of the viewers,  like a carrot in front of a donkey, and took him away at the last minute. \nThey had filler characters like the mother and best friend who added nothing to the plot! On the whole, infuriating !&lt;",

I just finished this show for the second time and I am forcing myself to not post a gush thread for this drama like I do all the K-dramas I completely fall in love with upon completion.\n\nI half watched, half listened the first time because the many characters were overwhelming. After being encouraged by this sub in my Prison Playbook thread, I decided to give it a real chance and boy, do I LOVE this show.\n\nI just love how character and relationship driven it is. The plots are secondary and devoid of the usual bad guys; like the top of the food chain bad guy, jealous 3rd wheel - Chihong the stalker doesn't count - or an evil parent. \n\nI ship Songwha and Ikjun something fierce.  The seriousness at which he approaches his relationship with her is toe curling because it goes against his goofy personality. The contrast of his attentiveness to her vs any external relationships was so subtle but upon second watch, whoa! Like how he brought coffee for her caregivers when they went for her results and totally embarrassed himself with his gratitude like one of his patients just did to him. The boy will leave an umbrella on a rainy night, the man will stay all night to bring her home. There better be flashbacks to explain why he called her his girlfriend when he was buying her a ring in '99\n\nIn contrast, the couple Winter garden, while cute a name, came out of nowhere. I wish they had shown his POV more. I felt it was one sided and after a while, thought she was being pathetic. At least she wasn't a total inappropriate stalker like Song's Mr Nice Guy",

That explains Ikjun's aggressiveness rather than it having anything to do with Chihong. His overtures were present in Chihong's absence so it wasn't for his benefit.",

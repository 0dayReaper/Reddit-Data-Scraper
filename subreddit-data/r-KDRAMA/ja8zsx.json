It's usually designed to show the male character as being young and inexperienced (hence still getting a bowl cut from mom).\n\nSecond, when you show more forehead you are showing more symmetry between the top of the face (forehead) and bottom of the face (chin). Symmetry is generally attractive. It also draws your gaze to their eyes and may possibly have the illusion of making their chin look sharper.",

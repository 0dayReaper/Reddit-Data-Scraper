    "postText": "Thank you so so much for all your participation! We have successfully gathered your answers! We are so touched by your love and passion toward K-dramas \ud83d\udc96\n\nIt will take about 3 weeks to draw the result and to check inside the company. After that, I will be back with the result!\ud83d\ude0a \n\nOnce again, thank you very much for your time on the survey!!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHello, I'm wavvesurf, and I am currently working as an intern at **Wavve**, which is a Korean OTT service company. Wavve is conducting a survey to see how global viewers see K-drama and the drama of Wavve. Since r/KDRAMA is such a big fandom of K-drama, we would love to hear your opinions!\n\n[**survey link here!**](https://forms.gle/DoKGHQVKAVmS3tm99)\n-&gt; link closed now!\n\nWe will ask the following things.\n\n1. Your personal preference for K-drama: the main platform you guys use to watch K-drama, your favorite K-drama, and your opinions on K-drama, etc.\n2. Your awareness of Wavve's drama\n3. Your personal information: only nationality, ethnicity, and age. These are only for checking the global preference for K-drama in a demographic way. Your answers will greatly help Wavve to create better content and have a global mindset.\n\nAll your data will be anonymous and kept strictly confidential. We promise that we will never use the results of this survey for purposes other than an indicator for our research. I assure you that the data will only be accessed by my team member.\n\nAfter the survey, I will be back to share the results(please note that the answers are gathered not only from here but also from other viewers around the world).\n\nThank you so so much for your participation!!",

I also hope you get some interesting insights.\n\nWas this survey specific to this subreddit, or was it  open to other communities as well? If it's possible to differentiate the community here from others, I'm super interested to know how the sub's preferences differ from other kdrama places. \n\nAs an american, and considering reddit is mostly visited by Western users, it's interesting to compare how the weekly Korean ratings differ from the shows that get the most user engagement on this forum. Sometimes, they are aligned, but oftentimes, they are not. It makes me wonder, why? \n\nAnyway, thank you so much for your own work and efforts &lt;3",

Writing should be reserved for open ended questions not things like nationality/country. Those questions should have had options to choose from. Demographics should be early questions for easy run through. I should be able to go through a survey in 5 minutes.",

But since we wanted to hear your every detailed opinion, we decided to put those questions. Also, thinking that global fans all around the world would participate, we made the nationality question as a writing one. Thank you so much for understanding and kindly doing the survey till the end!\ud83d\udc96 We will apply your feedback to our next survey! Thank you so much.",

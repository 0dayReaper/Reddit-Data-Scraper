    "postText": "This post is an *attempt* to address a common problem that surfaces in our community again and again -- when discussions get heated and things turn *personal*. By addressing types of comments that are often seen throughout the subreddit, we hope to help users maintain perspective on the comments they read so that they can conduct themselves in a civil manner. [*Original Post*](/r/KDRAMA/comments/jqrjx6/meta_when_discussions_get_personal/)\n\n***Disclaimer***: All examples are ***made up***, they are not quotes. **If any example resembles an actual comment you have read somewhere on this subreddit, the resemblance is completely coincidental.** Again, all examples below are works of fiction and any resemblance to real comments/situations is coincidental.   \n\n##Facts vs. Opinions\n\nLet's do a little exercise, read the following comment and then think about the questions that follow.\n\n&gt; **Kim Tan wore ugly sweaters in The Heirs.**\n\nAfter reading the above comment, think about the following:\n\n* Is this comment a statement of fact or an opinion?\n\n* Must everyone agree with this comment?\n\n* If someone agrees with this comment, are they right? If someone disagrees with this comment, are they wrong?\n\n**And Now The Answers!**\n\n***The comment is an opinion***, *a personal opinion* to be precise. It is not entirely a statement of fact even if it does contain a fact and so one should not react to it as if it were a statement of fact. \n\n***Why is this distinction important?*** The distinction between fact and opinion is important because the distinction dictates whether disagreement is possible.\n\nFor the purposes of our subreddit, we can define fact and opinion as follows:\n\n&gt; **Fact**: a statement that can be proven true or false.\n&gt;\n&gt; **Opinion**: an expression of a person\u2019s feelings that cannot be proven.\n\nThis means that statements of fact can be agreed upon because they can be proven true or false. A statement like:\n\n&gt; Kim Tan wore sweaters in The Heirs\n\nis a statement of fact and not up for disagreement since it can be proven true or false. Here are [Exhibit 1](https://giphy.com/gifs/Xbs2hmB9BTVR22VyKc) and [Exhibit 2](https://giphy.com/gifs/heirs-hsm4pCIo2WstcjPhSP) as proof of *fact*.\n\nBut a statement like:\n\n&gt; Kim Tan wore **ugly** sweaters in The Heirs\n\nis no longer a completely factual statement but ***now includes a subjective opinion*** -- the sweaters are \"**ugly**\". Now this statement is open to disagreement because subjective taste in fashion varies from person to person. One can find the sweaters ugly or find them gorgeous *or* feel no need to evaluate their fashion worthiness at all.\n\nOnce the distinction between **fact** and **opinion** is made -- that's when one should consider what kind of response to make *or* if one wants to respond at all. \n\nIf there is a misrepresentation of facts (*did Kim Tan wear sweaters in The Heirs?*) -- then it makes sense to contest that misrepresentation and present the actual facts because there is an objective fact that can be agreed upon (*Kim Tan wore sweaters in The Heirs*). \n\n**But** when the disagreement is about the opinion of others, including opinions based on or about facts, there is no right or wrong -- so please pause and *think* before responding in a manner that suggests or states outright that the opinion of another person is wrong.\n\n##Criticism Of Fictional Characters vs. Personal Attacks\n\nIt is important to remember that all dramas are ***fictional*** stories. They may depict things that happen in real life but they are not real life. Similar to all works of fiction in any medium, there are exaggerations, understatements, fantasies, and conjectures.\n\nAt the same time, all the characters in dramas are ***fictional characters***. They are not real people the way you and your fellow users in this subreddit are real people. As ***fictional characters***, the drama characters do not qualify as users in this subreddit and so the drama characters *are not* protected against personal attacks under our conduct rules. Yes, even Kim Tan is *not protected*.\n\n**Actionable Personal Attack Comment**\n\n&gt; *User_A comments to User_B:* You are stupid.\n\nIn this situation, User_A is making a personal attack against User_B by calling User_B \"stupid\". If this comment is brought to the attention of the moderation team (via reporting), the moderation team will remove the comment as a personal attack because a fellow member of the community (User_B) is being attacked. User_A will be given notice that their comment and behavior was inappropriate. \n\nUsers who repeatedly engage in such behavior, where their behavior has been brought to the attention of the moderation team, will face escalating consequences. If a user's initial offending behavior is deemed atrocious enough by the moderation team, such as using a racial slur, the moderation team will immediately take the utmost amount of action they can -- which is permanently banning the account **and** reporting the account to Reddit Admins. ***But*** the key here is that the behavior has to be brought to the attention of the moderation team -- to help with this step, please report rule-breaking comments that you see. Report the post/comment under our subreddit rules using the appropriate report (Personal Conduct/Incivility).  \n\n**Not Actionable Comment**\n\n&gt; *User_A comments:* Kim Tan is stupid.\n\nIn this situation, User_A is criticizing a ***fictional character*** -- or put another way, they are expressing their **opinion** on this fictional character. As Kim Tan is a fictional character and not a user of our subreddit, the moderation team will not take action on this comment. We are not here to protect the feelings and egos of *fictional characters*.\n\nHowever, this does not mean use of hate speech, including any slurs based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, etc., will be tolerated in our subreddit. **We do not tolerate any form of hate speech in our subreddit -- who is being addressed is irrelevant.**\n\n##Ad Hominem Attacks Based On Assumptions\n\nAnother category of offensive comments that can often be seen in our subreddit is the *ad hominem* attack. An *ad hominem* attack is when instead of addressing the merits of a claim made by a person or persons, the attacker instead addresses the circumstances or character of the person(s) making the claim. In our subreddit, the attacks made against the person(s) making the claim are often based on assumptions made by the attacker. \n\n**Example:**\n\n&gt; *User_A comments*: Anyone who thinks Kim Tan has bad fashion sense must be in love with Choi Young Do. \n\nIn the above example:\n\n* User_A is the attacker\n\n* \"Anyone\" is the person(s) making the claim\n\n* \"Kim Tan has bad fashion sense\" is the claim\n\n* \"must be in love with Choi Young Do\" is the circumstance the attacker is attributing to the person(s) making the claim, this circumstance is an assumption made by the attacker\n\nAdditionally, these are just *some* of the other assumptions the attacker (User_A) is assuming in their comment:\n\n* People that opine on Kim Tan's fashion sense conceive of Kim Tan and Choi Young Do as possible targets of (romantic) love.\n\n* People that opine on Kim Tan's fashion sense must love either Kim Tan or Choi Young Do.\n\n* People that opine on Kim Tan's fashion sense cannot both think Kim Tan's fashion sense to be bad and love Kim Tan at the same time.\n\n***So what do you do when you encounter a comment like this?***\n\n* You can choose to engage with the attacker and point out their logical fallacies. \n\n* You can choose to ignore the attacker.\n\n* ***If the attacker's comment involves hate speech***, you can can report the comment.\n\nExample of hate speech that is reportable:\n\n&gt; Anyone who emphasizes with Character_X must be a mistress themselves or have been a mistress in the past. \n\nExample of comment that is not reportable:\n\n&gt; Anyone who thinks Kim Tan has good fashion sense must love sweaters.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no exhaustive list to distinguish between the comments that are reportable and those that are not. Our moderation team's stance is that if the post/comment you read makes you feel very uncomfortable, then report the comment/post or flag the moderation team's attention via Modmail. We will do our best to resolve the situation, whether that's communicating with the user about the content they posted or providing perspective that may explain away a potential misunderstanding.\n\nBottom line for our subreddit conduct is that if there is nothing nice to say, one can *always* say nothing.\n\nLet's all live by the Korean proverb **\uac00\ub294 \ub9d0\uc774 \uace0\uc640\uc57c \uc624\ub294 \ub9d0\uc774 \uacf1\ub2e4** -- If the outgoing words are beautiful, then the incoming words will be beautiful, too.\n\n##Tips &amp; Tricks To Keep The Reddit Experience Positive\n\n###Opinions Are Opinions\n\nMost of the time, opinion comments are not preceded by the disclaimer \"in my (honest) opinion\" even though the comment is just that, ***an opinion***. One easy trick to keep reactions to comments in check is to remind one self that these comments are just personal opinions expressed by other users, no matter how the opinion is stated.\n\nSo when a user comments *\"Kim Tan has the worst fashion ever\"* -- this is still that user's personal opinion *despite* the user phrasing it as though it is a statement of fact.\n\nAnd because the comment ***is an opinion***, it's worth remembering that these are subjective so you don't have change your own subjective opinion on the issue just as that user does not have to change their own subjective opinion on the issue. \n\n###Assume Other Users Have Their Own Lives\n\nWhen engaging with other users, ***assume*** that the other users have their own life experiences ***and that these experiences differ from yours.*** That is, personal experiences are not universal. Things that may be obvious to you can be a completely foreign concept for another user.\n\nDiffering opinions are the result of different personal experiences. \n\n###Zoom Out\n\nSometimes it is helpful to remember why we do something in the first place. Why do you watch kdramas in the first place? Why do you participate in this subreddit in the first place?\n\nAs an example, when I find myself angered by a post/comment, I remind myself of why I watch kdramas in the first place -- it's something I enjoy. I treat Reddit as an extension of that experience. Does this post/comment thread add or detract from my enjoyment?\n\nBy zooming out to see how my Reddit experience is affecting my enjoyment of kdramas, I can better evaluate how I want to engage on Reddit. Sometimes this simply means disengaging. Always remember that you have the option to just walk away from a conversation. \n\n###Make Use of the Blocking Function\n\nFinally, a gentle reminder that it is possible to [block specific users](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/214548323) so that you no longer see content by them. Some may worry that blocking other users will create their own echo chamber, which is a valid worry. Ultimately, use of this feature will have to depend on your own values and priorities. *That said*, it is important to remember both the size of this community and how it is *very* possible to express differing opinion *without engaging* in negative behavior.\n\nWhich is to say, even if you block those users that engage in negative behavior, such as making inflammatory or degrading comments, there will still be *other users* that can provide different perspectives without the negative behavior.\n\n---\n\n*Note:* This post is part of our recurring post series 'The r\\/KDRAMA Approach' which highlights different aspects of our subreddit moderation approach and policies.

            "comment": "Mods, I used to come here a lot but now I just drop in from time to time to take the temperature of comments about new dramas.  As you know, many people will give positive or negative, general comments about what they liked and didn't and that can help you decide where to put a new drama on your watchlist. Most people will follow the rules and use spoiler tags for detailed comments that give too much away ... or you'll get a sense from the first few words that you should keep your eyes moving down the page without stopping on a particular comment.\n\nA few weeks ago, what looked like a general comment in the first sentence, turned, in the second sentence, into a complete synopsis of the final moments of the drama.\n\nI reported the comment and replied to the poster that they had spoiled the drama for me because they hadn't used spoiler tags.\n\nWhat I got back from 'the moderation team' felt, to me, like a kick to the gut. An anonymous moderator removed my comment and notified me that it was my own fault that I got the ending spoiled for me so I had no business harassing the person who had posted the comment. \n\nWhen I responded that I didn't appreciate being told off in harsh words, I was immediately muted and reported to reddit for harassment. My posts would then be invisible for some indeterminate amount of time.\n\nSo, what is this? I understand that it has been a huge task to keep bad behaviour under control as the sub has grown exponentially in size ... but moderation such as this is too much of an over-reaction. The wording was insensitive and rude. The action was immediate with no discussion. It came out of left field. I had no idea who had done it. And the comment that I replied to was never addressed.\n\nWhich is my point here. In your efforts to tighten up, your moderation has, occasionally, become too pointed and too swift with an air of disciplining bad school children. \n\nI've been around and very active here for many years now. I follow, and am followed by, many people ... so I was honestly shocked at this tone. I've communicated with many members of the moderation team about dramas and about issues ... and thought that I had good relationships with most, if not all. I've always tried to be a worthwhile part of the community ... by putting forward constructive posts and comments. So there was no need to speak and treat me in this way.\n\nI've also always tried to be supportive towards the moderation team members. I've had many reasons to thank you all. But you will see even less of me now and my constructive comment ... for this moment ... is that your tone does not always have to be so combative in order to get the job done.\n\nThank you for all that you do. And best of luck.",

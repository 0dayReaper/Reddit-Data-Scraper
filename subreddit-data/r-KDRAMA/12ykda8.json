            "comment": "There was a scene in an old TV show I was watching on one of those retro TV channels they have in the states? This, I don't remember but I think she was a housekeeper, she opens a door and walks into a room. Behind the camera you can hear a low key but intense argument going on in the room. One of those stupid married couple arguments that happen because one of them didn't sleep well the night before and is cranky, something like that, right? She walks in, see that, and says \"I'll just leave you two kids alone\" and immediately backs out and closes the door again.\n\nSo a few sweet kisses are no big deal, but as soon as anyone opens their mouth during a kiss I find myself making the exact same face as the lady in that picture. I whisper at the screen (yes, whisper, it's that ridiculous) \"I'll just leave you two kids alone\", and I fast forward out of the scene. Hahahaha sounds even more stupid now that it's written out, but there you go, I always feel like I'm invading a FICTIONAL characters' privacy!",

Bringing the lonely crown prince, Lee Hwan into her life at just the right moment, Jae Yi is saved from a dismal fate, but her salvation comes at a price.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Plagued by a mysterious curse, Lee Hwan agrees to help Jae Yi, but only if she agrees to help him break his curse in return. Unable to refuse such an offer, Jae Yi agrees to the prince\u2019s terms, setting them both on an unexpected path toward love. But what chance does their love have of surviving when one of them is a former murder suspect and the other is a cursed prince?\n\n* **Streaming Sources:** [TVING](https://tving.com/), [Viki](https://viki.com/), [Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Prime-Video/b/ref=atv_pr_sw_sc?node=2676882011)\n* **Conduct Reminder:** We encourage our users to read the following before participating in any discussions on [/r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA): (1) [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439), (2) our [Conduct Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_1._conduct) (3) our [Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies), and (4) the [When Discussions Get Personal Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/jqrjx6/meta_when_discussions_get_personal/).\n   * Any users who are displaying negative conduct (including but not limited to bullying, harassment, or personal attacks) will be given a warning, repeated behavior will lead to increasing exclusions from our community.

            "comment": "episode 7 thoughts:\n\ni\u2019m so immensely grateful for the last few scenes of this episode after the tears the leads shed throughout the previous hour. scholar park is my favourite \u2014 there\u2019s a wall between himself and the other leads that comes crumbling down whenever he\u2019s in their presence, which makes for some humorous and wholesome moments. i keep thinking i\u2019ll one day get over how emotive PHS\u2019s eyes are but seems that\u2019s an impossibility. \n\nwhen in the company of others, the crown prince is rather stoic and almost cold in nature. this makes complete sense when you consider what his father told him on learning of his injured arm: that yi hwan\u2019s priority should be to survive, that he shouldn\u2019t trust anyone, and that only after ensuring his survival should he even contemplate being benevolent in nature. \n\nthe past few episodes, it\u2019s only been when in jae yi\u2019s company (or thinking about her) that his true self has shone through, for she is the one he has been waiting for. when playing the role of scholar park, he is ironically a more authentic version of himself, and it\u2019s jae yi\u2019s behaviour towards him when free of the princely title that allows him, for a brief period of time, to feel unburdened; to experience the wonders and small joys of the world.\n\nas scholar park, we see him struggle to maintain authority. the assertive and commanding tone of voice (\u201ci said no! why would i miss you or even like you?\u201d) is him trying to hold onto a persona that is in conflict with his true self: his smiley, trusting, gift giving self.\n\nfollowing the end of episode 6, i tried to think about the whole situation from yi hwan\u2019s perspective. what evidence is there of jae yi\u2019s innocence? very little, if any. everything points to her being a murderer, to the extent that even she herself begins to question her innocence (or more specifically, the nature of her relationship with shim young). memory cannot be trusted, and the facts are anything but clear.\n\nyi hwan quickly came to trust jae yi because he believes in the truth of who she has presented herself to be: someone who is outspoken with their thoughts, who smiles radiantly at the realisation that he lives where the sun rises, and who strives to uncover the mysteries she\u2019s presented with. jae yi\u2019s mission is to *reveal* that which has been concealed, protect the innocent, and uncover the perpetrators of crime. that doesn\u2019t guarantee her innocence, but it creates in yi hwan\u2019s mind the picture of someone he can finally allow himself to trust. it is his father\u2019s past words and the reminder of the curse that makes his belief in jae yi falter. presented with further evidence against her, he\u2019s pulled back into an untrusting and fearful mindset, one that had become his norm prior to jae yi\u2019s arrival. \n\nperhaps this step backwards was a necessary one. having experienced a moment of weakness in his trusting of jae yi, one which led him to push her out and away, he is likely now more resolved than ever to support her in discovering the truth and clearing her name. and there\u2019s something else that yi hwan is learning from his mistake: absence really does make the heart grow fonder.",

And ParkHyungSiks ability to convey this is just phenomenal. These episodes just fly by for me because they are so exciting and alluring, and I am so looking forwars to the rest of this show. I thoroughly enjoy the soul that the actors have brought to these characters as well. The writing seems to really be on point. Especially how well the madness of isolation and mistrust is depicted.\n\nI hope I see more of your comments going forward. \ud83d\udcaf",

I'm not sure why some here are not feeling this show...for me it is much more than bearable, than average...for me, it approaches great.\n\nAs such, it is not afraid to sometimes portray the \"hard\" and \"difficult\" parts, like they did most of this episode.  We can see, though, that this is much more that manipulative melodrama, that it expresses a true subtlety and knowledge of how emotion and behavior evolve and grow.\n\nThe quick pace that many admire is part of that...we are not strung along for several episodes for crises to be resolved...like today's crisis of trust.\n\nThat \"step backwards\" was necessary to progress from faith to knowledge, to take off the training wheels and ride free.  Even in the short time allotted at the end of this episode, we witnessed several scenes which so delightfully demonstrated this.\n\nIt is stuff like this which make this show delightful...even with those hard parts.",

I was smiling the whole time!  Im not saying this is like the greatest drama of all time but Ive been loving it so far. Im very picky but the fact that Ive made it so far without dropping it or skipping scenes means its doing something right ( I may be a little biased bc of PHS). Plot wise, I really like the pace because small conflicts that usually goes on forever in other dramas seems to get resolved quickly. For ex, Yoon Jongseok coming clean about the tirtle thingie to the CP or the recent misunderstanding about the letter. It was also refreshing that Jae Yi got down to business right away when she came across CP in Ep 1 instead of living in disguise and hiding from him. \n\nThe only thing thats bothering me so far is definitely the whole love story between Jae Yi and Jongseok. Girlie hasn\u2019t even been bothered to keep herself updated on her so called fianc\u00e9e at the palace. I know she has to prove her innocence and all but you\u2019re telling me she wouldn\u2019t at least spend time stalking her boo from afar? \ud83e\udd28I thought she would make effort to interact with him more. Its not like she\u2019s been that busy either bc has free time to have fun with the CP. IDK im just not convinced that she has any feelings for him. It looks like Jongseok likes her way more. The love triangle is not in the room with us \ud83d\ude2d",

I don\u2019t know why I want it so bad but I doooo. But yeah\u2026 I wish there was a bit of equal footing going on at least in the beginning between jae yi and her dynamic with both. it\u2019s been so ramped up with the cp. and there\u2019s just nothing there with sergeant. Which doesn\u2019t make sense to me - the few times she has interacted with him he\u2019s been helpful and just because the cp likes her willing to cooperate - like giving her space to look around the shaman site and letting her bring stuff back. \n\nI was surprised that she didn\u2019t turn to the sergeant after the cp kicked her out actually. \n\nI am surprised that their interactions haven\u2019t increased and she doesn\u2019t try. I loved it when they did have like three minutes together in last weeks final episode because she did try to heal some slightly festering wounds between him and cp AND she got to see that he does still care about the fate of her as his fianc\u00e9. \n\n:)",

Nor do I find him to be effective comedic relief. I wish the drama didn't jolt THAT much between its tones. Because it's plenty funny in more subtle ways that I think fit better if they just committed to \"sageuk mystery\" as its genre. Jae Yi's shitake mushroom cursing was funny and all. The part I CRACKED UP AT was in this episode when she starts to walk away after they've had their conciliatory apologies and he says something that ticks her and she SEETHS when she whispers all anew \"that b\\*\\*\\*d!\" Or the little passive aggressive comments the princess' court lady whispers to the Princess. That court lady is HILARIOUSSS. :)\n\nooo also right there with you on your last paragraph / reflection of the drama so far. i also have gotten stuck on it, and i'll rewatch sections. but i'm also left every week kind of knowing deep down that there something about it that is not quite right and that i'm going to be disappointed by it/ already am. I'm glad to know this is a real space: to both be invested and spending time on a drama and thinking about it because something catches - but also forcing all that effort precisely because something \\*isn't\\* clicking about the drama and you're already quietly disappointed about something?\n\nAny tentative theories as to why?\n\nI think there's little pacing issues throughout the drama so far that impede connection. The writing doesn't know how to develop something. It just kind of hits you on the head with something- a character trait or a relationship they want to establish- and then forgets about it and then hits you on the head with it again. The tone this episode between the three like literally went from 0 to 1000000. I just wish that dynamic was more subtle and gentle. Or her like angsty women's speech in ep 1 and then flipping over to her being super devoted and dedicated to her fiance and then like literally forgetting about him until she wants to make the prince jealous ... ? don't know. The thing is I like the characters and I think they are fun to watch. And the premises are all interesting. They're just not developing interdynamics in a consistent way that I can relate to. ? maybe.",

This is the first I've seen of her, so I can only judge her acting skills based on this drama. \n\nFirst, she does well when she's being direct or when she's putting her investigative skills to use. When it comes to the more nuanced parts of her character is where it falls a bit flat for me. For most of this drama, she's been disguised as a man so we're used to seeing her like that, but in flashbacks of her living as a noblewoman,  I see no difference in her mannerisms, speech, or even the pitch of her voice; the only difference is her clothing. I think this is a shortcoming on the actresses part; she doesn't attempt to act differently by adding  any kind of subtlety to show the audience she is fully aware if she messes up her eunuch gig, then it's over for her. She's in an extremely dangerous situation but acts a little too comfortable within the palace walls.\n\nSecond, this is mostly the writers fault for creating a character who's cheerful even though her family was slaughtered. A top-notch fighter who can take on a whole hoard of men 3xs her size, even though she's extremely small in weight and stature. We're supposed to believe she's physically fit, yet she struggles to carry a couple of chairs? A close confidant of the CP, but has absolutely no romantic chemistry beyond that of colleagues. A fugitive on the run, but displays no desperation other than her first encounter with CP. Her character is all over the place as far as writing goes, so to be fair to FL, she's got a tough job. I do think that FL acting is that of a rookie, but I'm not totally hating her performance. Each episode there are hits and misses for me. I'd say a strong suit of hers is her comedic timing.",

Or at least not to the fullest extent he could be. He seemed genuinely shocked by the curse since the Yi Family entails his niece (Queen) and grandson. To be honest, I'm a bit suspicious of the SL's father. His little monologue about the King being the son of a servant (then the King repeating something similar in Ep 7) didn't sit right with me. Almost like he doesn't respect the current Royal family and wants to put them in their place.!&lt;",

Not just that, but it make sense with what the ghost letter says about the prince being betrayed by his best friend, it may not be know to the second male lead but him being the best friend of the crown prince is on purpose.",

That suicide note is pretty condemning evidence, even though we, as the audience, know the friend was probably forced to write his own suicide note before he was murdered. ML doesn't have our insight, so I was willing to accept the 6 steps back we've taken in the plot. However, the ML actions don't make sense. If he really believed the note, would he not have had her dragged off to prison? He knows her identity,  appears to believe she's a murderer and just decides to kick her out but continues to pine after her while she works within the palace? I don't know about y'all, but if I believed somebody's was a murder, I wouldn't be ok with running into them every day. Also, it's bizarre that he seems more bothered about the \"lover\" than the mass murder, I get he likes her, but wouldn't the suspected worst soup maker ever put a damper on those budding feelings? \n\nThe conversation between ML and 2nd ML was strange. It's like they were talking about FL as if 2nd ML already has the knowledge that FL is posing as the ML eunuch,  even though we know he doesn't know.  2nd ML \"she's still my woman, and I'll protect her,\" stated as if it was a warning to ML. ML \"If she comes forward, I'll send her back to you,\" assuring 2nd ML he won't try and steal his woman. 2nd ML \"remember you promised\" almost as if he knows ML has feelings for FL. This chat between them was oddly out of place and felt like it should've happened after 2nd ML finds out that the main leads have teamed up together to solve the mystery.  \n\nI have to admit, this show is rather disjointed and drags a lot, but I'm seeing it through because I love mysteries.",

We literally ended after one hour exactly where we started at the beginning.\n\nAlso agree the crown prince was being a dork this episode. He was neither being clever and kicking her out just for appearance or being paranoid and careless. He was just a mess of both and cruel.\n\nI also don\u2019t get why he\u2019s all of a sudden decided to be so harsh and mean and humiliate and isolate the sergeant. Like it\u2019s just painful how much he is causing the prophecy of his friend turning on him to come true. And the sergeant just doesnt deserve any of it. He delayed talking about the turtle \u2014 but besides that the set up of their relationship seems pre beginning of drama to be that he\u2019s always been loyal and he continues to pass all the tests over course of drama.\n\nI also thought the super dramatized loyalty/ longing / love-obsession between sml and fl was over the top and not believable and also almost out of character for both of them \u2014 they\u2019re both just too smart to be sweetly obsessing over someone they don\u2019t know.\n\nI did change my opinion on that with last weeks final episode. The context that their written marriage approval and the ritual of submitting the letter to their ancestors actually did hold pretty significant real life meaning convinced me of why he in particular would be struggling. This isn\u2019t just kid love/ obsession. It has already crossed into tradition and social significance because important rites were already enacted. Then in this episode he explained that the paper itself is almost legally valid and certainly socially - as it is legitimate evidence that as long as he keeps it he has a duty to her (and her dad/ family, who he is very loyal to and loves!)- for me provided additional deeper gravity to their relationship. I find it a convincing one - no , they don\u2019t have any actual relationship. But tradition, ritual, and duty in Joseon society are that powerful that it can create a relationship between them without them knowing each other.\n\nPlus\u2014 anyone with half a brain knows she was framed so I can see him being concerned just for that\u2026 annnndd the false story humiliates him a bit \u2026 so I can see why he has a motive to investigate and figure out what happened both because he\u2019s a good guy and cares about rule of law and justice and because it deals with his personal life\n\nDon\u2019t know :) he really won me over last week (he\u2019s so unrealistically open minded and ego-less!!! I think they really would have been happy together. She would have been so stimulated by his various duties in court and I think he would have over time if not immediately made her his no 1 confidant about state matters) but always love hearing alternative opinions and views :)",

When the CP and the sergeant were little kids, they went exploring and came across this little boy who made them pay a toll to cross over the river. The little boy who made them pay a toll gave them the wrong directions to the CP master\u2019s house. \n\nThey eventually found the CP master\u2019s house and got mad at the little boy who showed up. \n\nI don\u2019t remember anyone\u2019s names so apologies if this description is very confusing. I am so bad with names. \n\nAnyway, they wanted to punish the little boy for stealing their money by making them pay a fake toll. They eventually found out that the little boy was the daughter of the CP master and that she used the money to buy another little boy\u2019s freedom. The female lead showed her true character as a little kid.",

But I felt the conversation only happened because HSO took the initiative and had to almost grovel. I didn't like how Hwan played with the conversation. Only after making HSO feel ashamed that he was hopeful that Jae Yi was innocent ( flinging at HSO the same old \"she's a ruined women and murderer!\") Hwan decides to go cryptic and also express he'll protect her/ is investigating the case to see if she is innocent. HSO always gets backed up against the wall and forced to be totally vulnerable and powerless.\n\nIt also felt so bittersweet (though for all the right reasons). Re: the \"promise\". I've seen some interpretations on this thread about how Hwan leaves it in Jae Yi's control who she \"returns\" to. But I don't see it that way - at least from the translation I got. He first promises that if she's proven innocent and comes back, he'll return her to HSO. And only then backs it up with, \"she'll do so on her own.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;and it\u2019s hard to let him in if he needs keep Jaeyi\u2019s identity secret from him. Again, the decision to keep her identity from her fianc\u00e9 was Jaeyi\u2019s, not Hwan\u2019s, to begin with.\n\nThis is a good point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUm. I admit. That I've started to wonder / wish that the plot was different and that Jae Yi had gone to HSO instead of Hwan. Hehhe. :) Or at least already decided to reveal herself after some time at the palace observing that HSO is a good egg AND on his own accord sincerely trying to figure out the truth of her story. A situation where she leverages having two people help her through different approaches. :)\n\nBut I'm curious what would have happened in the alternative universe where she decided that HSO was the best bet person to first go to instead of Hwan.\n\nI don't know why I like HSO so much. ;) But I dooooo. He's adorable.",

Every time Hwan's pulled away from HSO, it's only serves to isolate him more, and Jaeyi's little Confucian lesson reprimanding Hwan that a good ruler must have trust, and not push away those closest to him wasn't just about her, but also his former best friend. When HSO confessed about the compass, they both had tears in their eyes. Hwan, up til then had totally irrational and unjustified suspicions of his best friend caused entirely by the psychological damage of the letter and his dad, but HSO's little slip up sadly was enough to justify his worst fears. It'll take a bit for him to climb back to trust with HSO, but I feel like this week was a step in the right direction-- his learning to trust Jaeyi more fully should be a character development for him to learn to trust HSO more as well. \n\nThe conversation as I said felt hopeful to me, even if Hwan was still being evasive and withholding at the start. As they conversed and HSO was so open about everything he felt, Hwan started being more forthcoming as well. The conversation also served to remind Hwan that Jaeyi is off-limits, and it showed Hwan's respect for their friendship that he FINALLY realized he needed to keep some distance from Jaeyi and refused to take her back into the East Palace. Turns out Hwan is not that obtuse, he realizes he's dangerously close to, if not already ready to acknowledge he's catching feelings. Ofc his valiant efforts towards noble idiocy lasted only until jealousy reared its head when he saw Jaeyi root for HSO at the polo match. It'll be interesting to see, this love triangle, because I think both guys have their hearts in the right place-- Hwan morally knows he cannot go there with Jaeyi, but his heart is leading him to acting differently. I'm not sure if I'm in the minority, but I really like the guys' friendship, and find it angsty in an enjoyable to watch kinda way.",

He had been so good up til then, and just gave up on her because of a letter that seems obviously forged, with foul play around the death. Why has he suddenly decided *not* to believe her, based on one thing? When he has believed her from the start? Argh! Sigh. \n\nI wonder also how long Min Jae Yi will have to keep acting as a eunuch. Is this going to be the case throughout most of the show?",

The way that they were holding the sanwiches was ideal for displaying a brand for an extending period of time... yet there was nothing. It felt almost eerie.\n\nI wondered it this scene was mean for a PPL that was later cancelled, but I have never expected to experience Subway PPL withdrawal like that. \ud83d\ude02",

He said that \"all human males are the incarnation of jealousy\" and suggested his help. It was ML from Jealousy Incarnate's cameo. Next FL and this guy watched The Master's Sun (with FL from Jealousy Incarnate) \n\n**Soundtrack #1** - ML (Park Hyung Sik) said to FL (Han So Hee) that she should watch some romantic dramas because she knows nothing about unrequited love as she watches only dramas about zombies and revenge. Meanwhile ML's previous drama was about zombies (Happiness) and FL's previous was about revenge (My Name)\n\nAlso, I spotted extra arm on Hotel del Luna's poster. I never noticed it before, tho I saw this poster many times. I realized they added a ghost on this poster (just as skeleton in the window) https://6.vikiplatform.com/image/74cc3b3c335c47bb90aa5cae5487246c.jpg?x=b&amp;a=0x0",

He starts asking questions about how the MC got a job at their super exclusive private school and tries to scheme against her before being shut down and made to look like the nerd he is. I have a feeling he'll show up again in part 2 with a dumb scheme and will possibly help the main antagonist to get one up on the MC after she brutally shut him down.   \n\n\nI always seem to see this side character in shows, they are usually a clown, always have it out for the MC because they feel slighted in some way and usually enact a bunch of schemes that blow up in their face.",

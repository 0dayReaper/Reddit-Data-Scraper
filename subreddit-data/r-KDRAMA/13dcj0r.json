Have you been mesmerized by all the Korean food onscreen? Have you succumbed to the allure of the PPL? This post is to share with others what have you done this past month because of watching Kdramas and see who else is like you!\n\nShare things like:\n\n* Hours of sleep lost because you got [caught up in a binge!](https://giphy.com/gifs/mother-of-mine-kGiztx4M3fkVlfkQdz)\n\n* Korean food you ate or cooked -- advice about ramyeon flavors or soju is also welcome!\n\n* [A new hobby](https://i.redd.it/k7k3fwfs40e41.gif) you've picked up or a rediscovery of an old hobby you loved!\n\n* [The gorgeous coat](https://i.redd.it/sdx50o1gpgg31.gif) you bought despite living in a place without winter and other fashion choices!\n\n* Updates about your progress with learning Korean -- whether you are studying formally or just acquiring some basic knowledge through too many Kdramas watched!\n\n* Your new Dyson hairdryer or vacuum and other PPL inspired purchases -- Subway counts too!\n\n* Travel plans and anything else that comes to mind when you think of the phrase \"Kdramas Made Me Do It\"!\n\nShare only as much or as little as you are comfortable with, just remember to be respectful of others and their choices.

I was able to see a healthy, mutual, equal, supportive relationship between man and woman and I feel healed almost. Like there\u2019s hope. My family\u2019s also super oppressive so I dont have friends and kdramas are able to fill that void in my heart. I have been emotionless for a while and somehow Kdramas have provided me a spark of hope. I\u2019m working on self-confidence bc I dont have any friends to help me but I\u2019m getting there through self care and just doing things for me. I\u2019m hoping some day I can explore the world on my own and who knows, maybe meet someone as amazing as Ryan Gold \ud83e\udd79",

At the end of the day, media simply portrays what *people want to see*, so it always should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nHowever, I can tell you one thing. If you are to explore the world through media, you are much better off doing it with k-dramas than with Hollywood.",

It was amazing - I felt like we were in every kdrama I\u2019ve ever seen, except the place wasn\u2019t as grimy and smoke filled! We tried so many items - tteokbokki, kimchi pancakes, bulgogi, pickled radish (which was so good). We cut up our pork belly with scissors and of course piled it onto our lettuce wraps and washed it all down with soju (poured for each other of course). I even had a soju bomb! My chopsticks skills need a little work - I am blaming my sending a cooked prawn skidding across the floor on that rather than the soju!\nWhen the waitress asked if we\u2019d ever been to a Korean restaurant before, my answer that, no but I watch a LOT of kdrama, left her a little bemused!",

It is way better than sitting through all the ads. \n\nIs it true that a past President of Korea or a politician  banned advertising during TV  programs years ago ? This made me laugh so much when I heard it not many Presidents or Prime Ministers would go against corporations and media companies like this but it's interesting that Drama series thrived on TV channels despite there being only product placements and no or very few ads ( if this is true ) . We limited product placements in my country some time ago but I wished we just banned advertising instead.",

Also, the original was a huge hit in America, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re remaking an obscure foreign show that American audiences won\u2019t be familiar with.",

Of course Lee Sung Kyung and Kim Young Kwang were really lovely together - the ending was perfect. My favorite was actually big sister\u2019s character - I have a soft spot for Kim Ye Won (Haesung) from her MC days on Transit Love (dating show) - loved her growth (so proud of her for her eating lunch by herself!) and how she handled her relationship with the security guard, happy with her ending too!",

I\u2019m fully preparing to get my heart trampled on but also excited for the ending.\n\n\u2022 Interesting characters + stellar acting by Woo Do Hwan, Yang Se Jong and Jang Hyuk.  This is my first time encountering these actors and I\u2019m totally blown away. Especially by Woo Do Hwan. I\u2019ll be watching **Joseon Attorney** next to see more of him in period costume.  And can I say - the bromance between the two MLs is extreme and their chemistry is on fire\u2026 they are the real OTP of this show.\n\n\u2022 Engaging pace. Unlike most other sageuks I\u2019ve tried, this one has a packed storyline and doesn\u2019t feel draggy at all. While there\u2019s a lot of politics going on (this is about the establishment of the Joseon dynasty, after all) there\u2019s not too many scenes with ministers gathered around the king or ministers conniving against each other. \n\n\u2022 Beautiful visuals. I\u2019m not just talking about Woo Do Hwan. The costumes are so pretty and the fight scenes are extremely well choreographed.\n\nThe show does have flaws - people in this universe get stabbed every which way and survive (unless plot wants them dead) and the FL\u2019s character feels unnecessary.  But neither of these two things detract from how enjoyable this show has been.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I was expecting when I started watching this for the Kdrama challenge (drama referenced in another drama), but this is going straight to my top list.",

Not sure I'm ready for the heart-trampling, though. \n\n&gt;people in this universe get stabbed every which way and survive (unless plot wants them dead)\n\nAbout a decade ago, I attended a presentation by two physicians for fantasy and science-fiction authors on realistic injuries in fiction. What I remember from the talk was that head injuries that are bad enough to knock you out aren't that easy to bounce back from. Every time someone gets knocked out in a drama and then regains consciousness and wins the fight or saves the second lead or whatever, I think of that talk. I'm looking at you, **Hello Monster**.",

Not really better or worse, just different.  (It's worse for shows where serious fangirling is required!)\n\nAlso, I got to go to Seoul for 5 days for work in February, and now every time I see a vehicle to roaring off somewhere with no traffic I laugh and laugh and laugh...  Traffic in Korea was no joke, especially at rush hour.  Even outside the city, it took a long time to get to open roads (like more than an hour).",

The fact that he immediately got that the FL was up to shenanigans and that the ML was in rescue mode but still played it off as a joke...

I was super excited for this drama and I'm so glad the premiere episodes made it worthwhile. I was pleasantly surprised to see Yoon Park. Given I loathed his character in FLaW, I'm really hoping he's likable as Yo-Han. Found him quite fun so far.",

            "comment": "I also think as they were trying to make this super accessible to the general public, that that's why the kisses stunk so badly. It's obvious from that 1 second shot of a non-dead fish kiss that this was 100% the director/direction and not the actors. I hate that. I know when I recommend BLs even on here I will get a lot of downvotes even when the recommendation is a perfect fit for the request. People just don't like them and I hope cute shows like this change the tide.\n\nSo ultimately I was not excited by the actors tension, not every drama needs that, but I didn't dislike it. And I thought the chemistry was fine, safe, quiet, but fine. This manhwa is one of, if not my top, favorite manhwas of all time. But that's because its about love, trust and what you will do for the one you love, not necessarily sexual chemistry (though the manhwa is still very explicit in places). So I am happy with what we did get, the story, pacing, flow. \n\nBasically this was a very safe but decent and solid adaption that I would happily recommend to anyone not deep in the BL genre or who just wants something cute. Was it Our Dating Sim or The Eighth Sense? Nope, but it is a nice and solid addition to Korean BLs. \n\nAlso I have to echo that Cha Seo Won is very attractive and played his role well. Too bad he is currently doing his military requirement as I would like to see him in more roles and soon. I also have to criticize the make-up. That were several times, especially with Gongchan but also Cha Seo Won, where the makeup was obviously running. Not a good look.",

Also happy the manager and ex boy fiend got some karma dealt. \n\nI am not crazy but sleeping beauty kisses so that\u2019s a negative, but I was getting into the second one and the phone rang. \n\nThe cinematography is some of the most gorgeous I\u2019ve seen, and I really want to know where they filmed this. \n\nI admittedly wanted to slap Wonyoung for his misunderstanding about the ex bf but luckily it wasn\u2019t dragged too long. \n\nI think the standout character is Donghee. I loved his expressions, actions, and the reason he didn\u2019t want to date. I wouldn\u2019t mind a show focused on him. \n\nI\u2019m going to miss this show so much. Was a touching and pleasant treat every week.",

            "comment": "The smelling of the sweater and the matching PJs were so sweet.   \n\n\nPlease writers/casting directors: please give me a season of just Dong Hee/Hoe Tae (or their actors in a new story).  But with kisses on a less mainstream platform.  I loved those two. \n\nOverall I enjoyed this as a filler, but I just feel like Chang Seo Won needs to learn how to emote more in his acting.  Legit I felt like Won Young grew by leaps and bounds in the last 4 episodes, and Tae Joon's facial expressions never changed.  Happy. Sad. Angry etc.  All the same.",

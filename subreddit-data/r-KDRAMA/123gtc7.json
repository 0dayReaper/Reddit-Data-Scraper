            "comment": "*episodes 15 and 16*\n\nthere\u2019s a lot going on in this drama: intrigue, murder, mystery, hidden identities, corruption, assassination attempts\u2026 despite all of this, what i can\u2019t help but focus on is the relationship between the lead characters and how this interacts with jae yi\u2019s characterisation as a woman seeking independence in a world that has a very restrictive perception of who she should be. \n\njae yi is independently strong willed, capable, intelligent and assertive. she\u2019s not dependent on yi hwan to save or elevate her. however, it also remains true that he helps in carving a path for her; as she states in episode 16, she\u2019s grateful for him having removed the wall that was blocking her path. ultimately, he\u2019s an ally in her quest towards freedom. it\u2019s meaningful and moving to see him buy her a house from which she can teach children to read and write, watch the sun rise from the east, and safely live on her own. with an apricot tree for company, she is being given the means to live life on her own terms; the restrictions of the society in which she lives mean that such freedom has to be facilitated by those with more power. however, the sentiment, and the love imbued in yi hwan\u2019s action, remains wholly good. \n\nit\u2019s frustrating to see him behave so coldly towards her during the scene in which he points out her \u201cflaws\u201d (which are more likely the reasons for his affection, the traits that make her someone he can be \u201cfrank with, [\u2026] rely on, and [\u2026] laugh with\u201d). there\u2019s no justification for him making her feel negatively about herself, and i do wish that the writing would ease off in this. he might consistently treat her well in secret, but it\u2019s not right to direct that level of meanness towards someone you supposedly care for, even if his words are not representative of what he truly thinks. what this drama does well though is show the psychological reasoning behind the behaviour of its characters; though yi hwan is not justified in talking to jae yi in this way, it\u2019s explained by the fact that he feels forced to discard his heart. \n\nwhat i hope these two characters soon say out loud to one another are the words that reveal their true feelings. perhaps jae yi already has, and it\u2019s simply the crown prince\u2019s \u201cdimwitted\u201d nature and lack of awareness that prevent him from seeing the truth in the following: \u201ci would think of you whenever the sun comes up from the east, for you reside in the east. since the sun comes up every day, i will end up thinking of you every day\u201d. for yi hwan, perhaps acknowledging that it is he who she loves would simply be too painful; rather his love remain unrequited than requited but with seemingly no way of the two remaining together. \n\nan undercurrent of humour runs through yi hwan\u2019s initial response to jae yi\u2019s \u201cconfession\u201d (though i still teared up!): \u201ci suppose occasionally i may think of you. whenever i see a young eunuch rushing about clumsily\u201d. what this drama is great at doing is painting a thematic circle within an individual episode. it doesn\u2019t forget where it\u2019s been or what\u2019s previously been said, which results in us, but not jae yi, hearing yi hwan\u2019s honest response to whether he will think of her when they are separated: \u201cjae yi, i am sure i will probably think of you every day as well. i will think of you whenever i go to the library. i will think of you when i go to the room you used to stay in too. even when i am sitting on my seat, i will be reminded of you. even when i see a short and skinny eunuch, when i get dressed, and whenever i am walking in the big palace, i will be thinking of you\u201d.\n\ni also have to mention how wholesome it was that she saved her gift to eat with him, and how upsetting it was that he prevented them from enjoying it together. if her willingness to share such a treat doesn\u2019t prove how in love she is then i\u2019m not sure what does. but the gift, repayment for all the food he\u2019d previously left for her, becomes tainted, just as his gift of a bracelet finds itself thrown into a deep pool of water.\n\nfinally, it\u2019s so funny to me that this week\u2019s cliffhanger was \u201cthey must be twins\u201d when we\u2019ve been saying that\u2019s the case for weeks now. generally speaking though, all four leads are intelligent and quick to figure things out. i did very much enjoy watching myung jin piece together all the clues and finally realise the true identity of his companions; he\u2019s a true modern day detective, complete with makeshift evidence/investigation board. at first his scenes felt somewhat unnecessarily to me, but i now can\u2019t imagine this drama without him. \n\nthe most obvious mysteries have now been solved (the twins, the bracelet, the identity of the queen, the nonexistence of the rebels), which means the final 4 episodes can focus on revealing the answers to the two biggest questions: why was yi hwan \u201ccursed,\u201d and what relation does everything have to jae yi and her family? \n\n(this comment got very long, i apologise! downside of watching two episodes back to back is that i have too much to say in one go\u2026 oops)",

I always try to wait for your comments, then I can be lazy since you've already said all or most of what I would have said!\n\nI would add one thing regarding the relationship between our two leads (and forgive *me* if I go on too long in doing so!).\n\nWhen YH asks JY how she could fall for a \"stupid dimwit\" first she says that the person she loves is \"tall and handsome\" and then goes on with a long list..he \"excels at pen and sword\", \"possesses inner fortitude and overcomes all sorts of hardships\", \"learned the basics of medicine that could save a life\", is a \"warm and compassionate person\" and \"is considerate\", is \"a reliable man\", is \"someone who opens a new path, for a woman who is stuck, blocked by a high wall\".  To which he replies \"Where is such a man like that, he is someone who might show up in fantasy novels on the streets?\".  And then the kicker, her rejoinder:\n\n\"There is a man like that!  I am saying that he is a dimwit for not knowing he is that kind of man!\"\n\nAnd then he gets mad, furiously jealous of himself!\n\nNow this is a lot of fun, sort of slapstick, even.\n\nI think, however there is something much deeper going on.\n\nFirst, let us take it as a given that all our gang of four are supremely talented and goodhearted, brave, resourceful and loyal.  All heroes, truly!\n\nYH, though, has been stuck...and slowly becoming unstuck due to the interventions of the other three.\n\nAt the beginning, he was truly in a rut, numb and dazed, fearful and insecure, his \"youth\" a case of arrested development.\n\nJY has ever been adaptable, fluid and flexible, her path and goals always firm and secure.\n\nNow she has been providing him nourishment (those \"shitake\" mushrooms enhancing the \"soil\"?).\n\nShe has been guiding him, leading him slowly, step by step.  Their personal relationship is akin to a psychiatric one (where the therapist models behavior on direct observation)...that is, the growth that develops is much more than that of their particular romance, which becomes the template for all else.\n\nSo, why doesn't she just \"confess\"?  Why does she let him go on being a dimwit?\n\nBecause that would be superficial, it would be artificial.  She has guided him...and now he is right at the edge.  She told him so clearly and plainly.\n\nIt is the tipping point, one that he must himself go over, make that final push, and release all his doubts and allow his heart (and all their hearts) to bloom.\n\nA slow burn, maybe...but not just a tease.  And necessary.",

And his true mentor was taken from him before his own maturity, with the King leading him further astray, not towards evil, but towards isolation and distrust.\n\nSo, there was first a lot that had to be removed, before new ground could be lain.\n\nIt is JY who has been the most self-aware...of all our group...perhaps because her talents and energies have impelled her to already overcome so many barriers and impediments.  It is this awareness which also allows her to trust and accept help when needed...and, when *needed*, to give back in return.",

Before Jaeyi brought light to his dark world, he was fighting to survive while feeling doomed to fail, to be deposed, never enough. He doesn\u2019t realize that\u2019s how she sees him, as he doesn\u2019t see himself like that. I\u2019d even argue the more nurturing, caring aspects of Hwan had been buried along with his brother, and didn\u2019t come back to surface until Jaeyi gave him the strength and courage to come out to the world again. When you\u2019re fighting to survive and suspicious of everyone, with no love in your life, you don\u2019t have anything left to care about others. With Jaeyi, his loving and caring nature and hopes for Joseon have dared to rise up again.\n\nThat said, the other part of Hwan\u2019s cluelessness I think, is that while he may not realize all the positive traits Jaeyi mentioned, he\u2019s always known he\u2019s capable in pen and sword, and been praised all his life, so part of his cluelessness seems to be that his ego may not be allowing himself to be characterized as a moron \ud83d\ude05. But his fun encounters with the Manyangdang gang seems to have helped with the ego a bit, as he learned to take their swipes at the CP in stride and even learned to make fun of himself. So he will get there. I hope soon! I am so invested in this romance it\u2019s not even funny!",

So basically he is bypassing the reqs himself. That would make it so much easier for Hwan to eventually assert his right to choose the Crown Princess (or would it be his Queen by then?) of his own choice, bringing Jay-yi in. The way it has turned out, Queen  is sure to die, and I guess so will the King. With all 5 guards given a go-ahead to protect the CP, I am guessing there will be an all out war sometime soon.\n\nAlso, I think the house will also be used as a place to show where he had hidden Min Jay -yi all this time, so that she gains her respectibility back as a maiden in hiding under royal protection because she was CP's Master's daughter.\n\nOf course, the royal's Eunuchs will go tizzy with confusion - though I think the three Eunuchs will have more important role to play to bring Jay-yi back to the palace, this time as their Queen.",

He is not the kind to share, though he wants to be benevolent.   \n\n\nBut CP is not going to let her go in any case. She will end up being the Queen, and then moonlight as Eunuch Go at times, and teaching poor kids in disguise during at other times.",

Here, though, it's a group of normal people who are putting an ingenious plot together to get revenge for what was done to their town. \n\nIt's a really interesting twist on this kind of subplot/backstory and it works in this drama because of how much effort goes into characterizing the Byeokcheon people. Today's scene with the kids/tavern owners was pretty powerful. Some aspects of the Byeokcheon revenge plotline that had seemed creepy or evil - like the monk guy and his blood-drinking fish - were placed in a very different light today.",

His eyes speak volumes. The little tiny glimpses of his humanity through the mask of the CP is such a treat for me. He just can't help but let those pieces out.\n\nI loved seeing &gt;! the bracelet mystery concluding, as well as TheTeacher putting all the pieces together -- in true hilarious fashion, by the way. !&lt; \n\nI am was blown away by the &gt;! reveal behind the peach, but I can't wait to find out if someone essentially persuaded the GrandPrince to give him the peach, knowing full well what would happen.!&lt;\n\nI am a little shocked at this point that &gt;! she hasn't revealed her love for the CP directly to his dumb-butt face. I just feel that after 15 episodes of basically torturing us with this love, we should get a confession or a kiss or something. But my thought is that I feel the writers would not keep us hanging like this, dangling the love, all for nothing. If that's the case, then I can surely wait for a passionate kiss/confession scene. If it ends badly, I'll need therapy. \ud83d\udc80 So, for the record, I think they will have a happy ending. I am at least attempting to manifest this, as I did NOT sign up for a KTrauma, AM I RIGHT?! !&lt;\n\nI think the scene with the Sargeant was so important because &gt;! now we know he is kind of attempting to understand why JaeYi wouldn't come find him. This, I think, is setting the scene for him to easily get behind the CP and JaeYi love story without being too damaged with the aftermath.!&lt;\n\nAll in all, I just can't complain. The show had me hooked early. I love the pacing, the acting, the story, the mystery, the action, the FEMINISM. I am shocked that I like a Sageuk like this. But SIGN ME UUPPPPP. Can't wait until tomorrow fam. \u270c\ufe0f\ud83e\udd0c",

That notwithstanding l believe she probably already  killed the princess's mother to get her position and then she's been in on our crown princes's toture all along so she's not playing at the innocent sheep but she's going with the route of a wolf...with characters like her l love that with all the cruelty they cause its not that they intend to survive its aftermath. She knows that her child will probably be the last casualty then after that she will die a painful death. I bet if she had succeeded in killing the princes her last words to the girl would be!&lt;\n\n\\&gt;!Queen : &gt;!\"since you called me mother when l am nothing but a sinner, l hope l suffer the sufferings of one who is unfilial and kills her own child for greed.

If I had to guess, he discovered early on that the Jo family had engineered some kind of massacre in Byeokcheon to cover up their own nefarious dealings. I feel like something (maybe not this lol, but definitely something) is implied in the flashback scene where he witnesses the Song rebel guy's execution. I'm thinking he's been manipulating events ever since (perhaps helping the Byeokcheon people plot revenge) to undermine the Jo family, build up his own power at court, and convince the King that he's a trustworthy ally (as he has clearly done).!&lt;\n\nHe doesn't have anything to gain by unleashing any *further* chaos in the court, but I think part of the tragedy of his arc will be that the forces he already unleashed are out of control &gt;!(i.e. I think the Byeokcheon rebels will do something pretty crazy to seek revenge, and the Jo family, feeling backed into a corner, is probably going to kill the King). !&lt;I just hope &gt;!the Sergeant!&lt; ends up OK if my theory is right.",

The odds of something like this ever actually happening in this time are basically zero. This drama gives us the ability to imagine that empowerment was possible in those days. In itself, it feels very liberating to just watch. \n\nThis is all my personal take, as a woman, and not meant to be an argument against your words.

I'm aware there were particular rules in the Korean Joseon kingdom which sound quite repressive, and it seems to have been a very strictly-ordered place to live. It sounds more strict and difficult than life in, say, Europe or England at the time. I don't actually know enough about their history to be certain of all the details, though. I just wonder how much of the repression we hear about for women in history is representation and simplification, and how much is accurate - and failing to consider how many different countries and systems there are and were, and how these were not all the same. Women's situations were different in various places. \n\nThere's also the fact that women have long held power in different ways to men - and the way power and liberation is seen now is different to how it has been seen in the past, and that colours people's (current) perceptions. For example, *being* the state minister would be seen now as true liberation, equality, fairness, etc. for a woman; but being the *wife* of the state minister then would have been power, particularly through the wife's influence on her husband, but also through how it affected her personal position in society.",

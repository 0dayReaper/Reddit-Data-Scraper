The punches sound packed and heavy that I sometimes flinch when punches were being thrown.\n-\tSince this is more action-oriented kdrama, my dad and brother were glued to the TV the whole time hahaha!\n-\tLee Sang Yi seems like he will be delivering the laughs in this one but I bet he has a deeper story to tell.\n\nHopefully, the story remains strong and we get a great revenge action drama til the end.",

The moves are different, and you really see the power in the punches and the speed. It\u2019s how Batman fights tbh. lol",

I will just list a few.\n\n1.  15 people destroying a storefront and the police don't show up from all the noise it makes.   No one calls the cops that a mob is destroying property along a street.  A good 10 or 15 minutes pass and no police at all...South Korea have police everywhere.  \n2.  Villian shows his face plain as day, and we are to assume this is 2020 or 2021..cameras are eveywhere.  This guy has made deals with the mayor, other large important businessmen and is now on camera looking like a mob boss and involving himself in street level crime\n3. Cuts that main characters face..so he has committed about 12 felonies, not including finance fraud from this scene alone.   No amount of connections could get this guy off the hook, he is going to jail and IRL he and his goons would be in prison the next day.",

The gritty locales enhance the atmosphere, as befitting a drama in the noir genre. \n\nLet's keep this up for six more episodes, **Bloodhounds**! Fighting! \ud83e\udd4a",

Woo Do-hwan and Lee Sang-yi's characters have a great dynamic and it was fast-paced. Definitely recommend it.\n\n&gt;!Since the stakes were so high I knew there'd be a few character deaths. I always thought one or both the knivers would die and once the grandpa started talking about going to Rome I knew he was a goner. I thought for a second they had actually killed off Woo-jin but I'm glad they didn't, it wouldn't have been the same without him.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I'm so glad they didn't shoe-horn in a romance plotline with the grand-daughter and the lead, and I didn't mind when her character disappeared. The heart of the show is really the friendship between the two main leads.!&lt;",

            "comment": "Guys this drama was EXHILARATING! Packed with action and adrenaline from start to finish, the action scenes were well choreographed and executed. The cast was stellar and really nailed their characters. Do Hwan and Sang Yi's chemistry was off the roof!!! I loved their bromance, I loved the good guys, I loved everyone!!!\n\nHOWEVER... My biggest gripe is \n\na. The show was only good up to 6; ep 7 onwards felt extremely disconnected and the tonal shift was strange...almost like watching an entirely different drama?! The cinematography and color grading felt off too. \n\nb. Many stupid decisions were made...i know we usually have to suspend logic and belief for dramas but come on.. there were so many opportunities for them to KILL and get rid of the bad guys (in beom, jun min, myeong gil) but somehow they always let them live/escape wtf... Ep 6 rly infuriated me because I just felt that the good guys shouldn't have had to die for naught like that... The knifers were underutilized as well. \n\nc. I understand that the drama was also affected by Kim Sae Ron's driving scandal hence they had to make changes to her scenes/involvement but im telling you...it made NO SENSE that she would completely pack up and go to Rome AFTER ALL THAT!!1?!?!! She completely disappeared eps 7-8 LMAO and it just felt like wtf? The whole show took a turn for the worse because I mean..the whole plot started because of her (she was investigating Smile Capital) so to take her out halfway really made no sense. She should have been the one, along with the guys, to come back and finish what they started. She should have been there to land the final blow on the villain to avenger her Grandfather. This was so stupid :\\\\\n\nIn all, my rating is 7.5/10. I loved everything but eps 7-8 really affected the cohesiveness of the plot for me.",

                    "comment": "I loved this show but I absolutely agree with all your points...The episodes were so great up until the middle of episode 6 and then the writing just sundowned after that. It sucks because the series had so much potential and brilliant writing up until that point, after which all logic and intelligence just went up in flames.\n\n&gt;!I was so pissed during episode 6 that I didn't even shed a tear or feel anything when all those epic characters got unalived. And I am a crier!!  I get that they had to kill the older people just for plot ammo but there were better ways of doing it instead of stupidly underestimating the enemy with no clear plan in sight and then dying..  Like, why were they always waiting around and super optimistic? They knew what Myeong gil was capable of, and how resourceful he was, and they still took their own sweet time with their plans! The villain Myeong gil constantly had the upper hand because he always expected the worst possible outcome from their enemy and his plans, so he always made contingencies and prepared for the worst... unlike our happy fight club.. honestly! I was so frustrated at the naivety! The police and the leads were also so incredibly oblivious to the very obvious information leaks until they all got brutalised by Myeong gil and weren't diligent in checking for backups (also, what happened to the data on the laptop?). This was despite knowing Myeong gil had a cop working for him! And then they completely rushed the ending in some weird plan that could have gone wrong in so many ways, but their solution if it did was to promise to chase Jang do if the intel was wrong? Wut..!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I also agree that they underplayed the knifers so much. Where was all the expert knowledge that Yang Jung imparted to the boys while he was being attacked? If the opponent had shoe blades that gave him an upper hand, why didn't Yang Jung just aim for his knees, feet or cut his achilles tendons - wasn't this his special skill? =_= And if his opponent wore Kevlar, why didn't he aim the sword and knife at parts not shielded by the armour (e.g. his throat, eyes and feet) that would take critical damage. And yet he just tried to hammer the sword through his kevlar lmao. They completely wasted the skills of the knifers who should have ideally gone down in an epic showdown. Also, why on earth would Du Yeong tell his wife to call the cops in a life/death situation instead of Mr Choi, noting he was also a criminal and that they were all in danger? It made no sense.. I get that desperation forced him to give up their locations, but how did he give up so much detail in his concussed state, with so much blunt force trauma? And \"I always keep my promises, you can trust me..\" Lmao.. Du Yeong, you know he's a bad liar! And don't even get me started on how weak he ended up being against a comparatively smaller number of thugs to those encountered in the underpass by the three kids, during his intro scenes ..!&lt;\n\n&gt;!As for tying up Hyeonju's storyline, they could have at least made a phone call to her in the last episode and got another actress to do voice acting, with the camera facing her back or shadow - there are creative ways of working around this.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I also found their blind trust in the chaebol heir Min Beom at the end, so incredibly naive. Yes, he may be a good guy at heart who grew over the series, but it's a lot of money to put so much trust in, especially when he no longer needs them! He is no Bruce Wayne! Besides, shouldn't they have just handed the gold to Mr Oh who was already managing Mr Choi's financial affairs? I was confused by that ending tbh...!&lt;\n\nThe series had so much wasted potential ;_;\n\n&gt;!Now to the positives:\nThe character development was chef's kiss!! I loved all the characters but Gun woo and Woo jin were so special. I love how much they complemented each other and I love the chemistry between them. The acting was top notch from the whole cast, from all the tender moments to the comedic ones. The scenes with Gun Woo, Woo jin and Hyeonju with Gun woo's mom were sooo wholesome. Hyeonju had so much growth as a character and I love how they explored her growth over the series. In fact I love the transition in appearance after the time jump, how Woojin was a bit more battle hardened after the incident.. it's almost like they flipped roles with the two of them, and it was great to see how Woojin got a little more serious, cautious and gentle, while Gunwoo became a lot more bold and brash.!&lt;\n\nAll in all, I was very happy except for the lazy writing in the last three episodes.. I would give this series an 8 nevertheless because of the solid 10/10s from the previous episodes - from the cinematography to the acting to the music to the fight sequences (such amazing stunts and fight sequence choreography that were so entertaining to watch).",

The drama was really good though, it felt like they rushed episode 8 though. There were so many opportunities for them to end Im-Beom though, but they kept him alive and that honestly felt like they were just dragging it out.",

It started SO well and it developed so nicely only to have some of the worst final episodes ive ever seen.\n\nGoes from doing a fantastic job in character development to WTF happened in a single episode. Most people could see the path that it was taking by episode 5 to 6, then they actually did it and i was like wow, only to be thrown in the next episode out of nowhere.\n\nI swear the last 2 episodes are another show, they make no sense at all. I've read some comments and people still praising the show, but i can't get past the last 2 episodes being so disconnected from the rest of the script, bringing back characters that had no need or right to be there anymore, introducing random new characters to the plot just because, the change of atmosphere after the previous episode felt so off. The show has some flaws that i wont delve in to it, whoever some of those can be overlooked in favor of storytelling, but the last 2 episodes...why...just why.\n\n--\n\n\nYou can easily define this show into one word, potential, it had so much and it felt so short.",

            "comment": "A lot of people are commenting on how the show was doing great until episode 7 and 8. **I wonder if Kim Se Ron(rich good guy grandpa's granddaughter) getting convicted with DUI IRL had something to do with the sudden deterioration of the show's quality.**\n\nThis show was filmed on or before 2022 and I found an article from 2022 that says they would redo the filming with a different actress following Kim Se Ron's DUI case. However, seeing as how the show just released with her still in it, I'm guessing after episode 6 is when she was caught with DUI and instead of refilming the series with a different actress, they decided to just abruptly cut her out from the show and patch up the show as best as they could.\n\nOf course, this is all deductive reasoning and speculation, but with what limited knowledge I could gather, this makes the most sense.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFound the reason why they decided against the original plan of refilming with a different actress:\n\n***The Bloodhounds director told the South Korean media outlets that they invested a lot of time and thought into editing all of Kim Sae-ron's scenes. He said that they did their best to edit as much of her parts as they could without messing up the narrative and the flow of the main story.***\n\n***The director said that a lot of people put in their blood, sweat, and tears into making the series and they couldn't damage that because of one person's misdeeds. He noted:***\n\n***\"But we completely understand that viewers would not want to see scenes featuring Kim, so we compromised and edited them out as much as we could.\u201d***\n\n[Source](https://www.sportskeeda.com/pop-culture/news-decrease-discomfort-bloodhounds-director-kim-joo-hwan-explained-edit-scenes-kim-sae-ron)\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo, it appears Kim Se Ron's DUI conviction affected the show overall. I'm guessing her character abruptly leaving the country to Europe wasn't even a part of the original story.",

Geon-woo &gt;!finding the big brother he always wanted!&lt; is so relatable. I also love how quickly Geon-woo and Woo-jin became friends. It can really be like that with guys lol. Just one random moment of connection and you become besties for life. All of my closest friends and I hit it off immediately and went from strangers to brothers within a day so it\u2019s great to see this on screen. Bloodhounds can be a little gruesome to watch but it has so much heart behind it. Whoever was in charge of green lighting kdramas for Netflix during the pandemic needs a raise because they\u2019ve been knocking it out of the park with their releases this year. The Glory, Queenmaker, Black Knight, and now, Bloodhounds have been stellar. I liked Love to Hate You as well. Next up is Celebrity at the end of the month.",

But there were a lot of plot holes and really they should have &gt;!killed Myeong-Gil way earlier, like President Choi and Hwang Yang-Jung were lamenting about!&lt;\n\n&gt;!It was too predictable when the crew got too happy and sappy about taking down Myeong-Gil. I knew the President and the two knifers were going to die then. It's a shame though, because they were definitely more intimidating and formidable compared to the two main young stars.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Which of course brings me to my overall issue with the drama, where there were a lot of side characters, so even though the two boxers are the main characters, it didn't feel that way. It wasn't their fight, but the plot had to find a way to make it their fight. The boxers were useless aside from fighting and needed too much help, but it's understandable with how the story went. Introducing the granddaughter archer, and the cop crew, and then had them taken out, but conveniently they also survived!!&lt;",

It does  towards the end pick up again, especially when all the action starts.\n\nI give this drama high points for the fight choreography that was really well done, with some really dope moments fighting wise. Trust me I'm a big martial arts movie freak so I don't get impressed easily but I enjoyed most of the fights here, favorite I must say was the fight at the end in the first episode.\n\nOverall if you like action and a simple straight plot and pretty fast paced drama, give this a watch.",

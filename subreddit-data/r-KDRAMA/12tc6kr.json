And we haven't made it to the \"contract\". phase  \n\nBut after Ep. 8. . . I'm here for it.  LOVED that ending/cliffhanger!!  Really enjoy/admire the two leads, especially ML.\n\nI hate the inevitable \"break-up\" mid-drama and if it happens, that's when I depart.  But after reading the synopsis, I think that perhaps. . . .hopefully. . . might not. . . .happen\n\nEven tho it is \"soapy\" and \"low budget\" I truly enjoy the story of the Main Leads and (most) of the side characters.  Crossing fingers that the writers are producing multiple stories/plots that maintain cohesion, continuity and a solid ending.",

Didn't realize this was going to be 50 episodes until I was completely hooked by Ep.7.\n\nThe FL Beak Jin Hee plays the despicable Empress Danashiri in Empress Ki. My only 50 episode drama (and 50 episode rewatch) so far. I had been wondering what she had been up to because she was so deliciously spoiled and pure evil but with a storyline around infertility which added humanity to the character. It's fun to see her play a normal absolutely not infertile woman here. \n\nI'm really enjoying the story and all the different layers around fertility and babies (&gt;!the brother's teenage pregnancy, the IVF couple, and the divorcing couple's accident!&lt;). I also thought the whole way they went about the discussion of &gt;!choosing whether to have an abortion or not!&lt; was very well done.\n\nSo far my favorite thing has been the developing chemistry and closeness of the lead couple. As you say, we're not even at the contract stage yet (likely this weekend), but their dynamic is not going to be one where the couple is forced or indifferent and I'm wondering how the writers will navigate that to stretch it to 50 episodes.\n\nAlso, I really hope the baby comes to see how the two families deal with it. I'm already a fan of both grandmas, but they will have opinions!",

Happy to see Ahn Jaehyun acting again, and his chemi with the female lead is actually very cute lol. They're so sweet and supportive of each other in these ridiculous situations. i appreciate that as soon as he realized he misunderstood her (with his mother), he apologized! Then they cutely went ice skating. I'm looking forward to the friendship pivoting to romance.",

We already have, among others, &gt;!a twisted arranged marriage, an ambush proposal, a humble teacher getting dragged by his paranoid social climber spouse, and a couple that got pregnant on the verge of divorce,!&lt; while the leads have already talked out their problems, forgiven, and have gone far and beyond for each other a few times already, despite being practically strangers.

I know the description says contractual relationship, but does that mean actual marriage or just engagement. \n\nThe FL's family was really annoying me with their reactions these past few episodes. Like they all depend on the FL and pile all this responsibility on her and still they treated her badly\n\nI suspect that the ML's sister didn't &gt;!have an abortion but a miscarriage!&lt; and the brother-in-law is just wrong. So, it will be interesting to see how they progress. \n\nI really dislike the Se Jin and the ex-bf. But I guess we are supposed to since they will prob be the main antagonist along with grandma. \n\nTheories: At some point the ML's bio dad will show up (they never said if he was dead or not) and so will the FL's niece's bio-mom. Usually if there are missing bio-family they will show up at some point.",

A question though - are the sets, costumes, etc. usually so low budget for these weekend dramas? I understood that they are very popular in South Korea and pull in big rating so I was surprised to see some of the sets looking like 90s telenovelas. The OTT dramas I've seen which might be more niche seem to have better production value. Maybe it is just me?",

                            "comment": "Just to add to what u/moktailhrs said, I also don't have an exact answer. But family and historical dramas were some of the most popular genres in Korea for a long time. In part, I believe some of it has to do with both being one of the earlier genres in Korean television history.\n\nBut, because they started much earlier, the dramas also used to be much, much longer. Like even decades long. Until the 1990s, almost all dramas were much longer. And, like in the 1990s, you still have several hundred-episode daily dramas or a 200-episode historical drama.\n\nSince they were earlier, the budget would have been a huge problem because of the state of Korea in general, so it'd make sense in terms of money but also for the audience to have low-budget family dramas. And, I think they've definitely tried to stick with that since family dramas were never meant to be impressive looking or have good plots but have the family get together and sit around the tv on a Saturday night.\n\nBut, because of the lack of change and other reasons, we've seen more unconventional length family-centered dramas, less weekend and daily dramas airing (SBS and MBC don't do weekend family dramas anymore; from 8 to 3 airing daily dramas), and less actors that are starting out go to weekend family dramas. Many \"older\" popular actors started out or had one of their first major roles be in a weekend family drama/daily drama such as Park Hae-jin, Ji Chang-wook, Park Seo-joon, Shin Se-kyung, Lee Min-ki, etc.\n\nEdit: and from airing 5 weekend family dramas to 1 weekend family drama",

I feel so irritated every episode, and I can't vibe with Joo-Young Cha as much as I did in The Glory. Even though I was against her, I sometimes empathized with her being the low man on the bully totem pole.   \n\n\nSince everyone is speaking so highly of this, I feel like I have such a dissenting opinion. I am all caught up, but I am almost watching because I have made it this far, and I want to see my ML/FL have a happy ending.",

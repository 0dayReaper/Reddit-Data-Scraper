They also offer a two week free trial so you could binge once it's done and cancel before the first bill. But I decided to try it for the month (technically 6 weeks) and so I am catching up on Taxi Driver as well to make the most of it. I have Viki Standard too (grandfathered into the 4.99 rate so I won't change it). I noticed there were several titles from Plus that got bumped to Standard recently (and it was all at once I noticed - - they must do it in batches). So Joseon Attorney could be one of those in a year or so, too.\n\nKocowa is interesting because you get a TON of BTS extras.",

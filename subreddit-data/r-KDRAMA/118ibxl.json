I hope she continues to be a badass and sow chaos for the rest of the story and doesn't lose her personality halfway through the way it sometimes happens in kdramas.\n\nThe ML may or may not have, like, depression on top of having profound mommy and trust issues, but I'm sure being stalked by a feral yet charismatic woman who hates him will cure all that.\n\nUgh, I love romantic dramas where both leads are prickly assholes guarding their soft underbellies.\n\nI wish the director had gone easy on the pink filter in some scenes, but oh well. It's not a big deal. (The direction is not on the same level as the writing, but it's good enough for the strong cast and script to shine, so I don't mind.)\n\nI sense the FL's older sister and childhood friend may have a thing later on.",

Looking for some of that sexiness to come through as the story unfolds. I already started seeing hints of chemistry and interest between them. It bodes well when the sparks already fly when they fight at the beginning.\n\nThe pink filter must have been a Disney+ thing.

Kinda reminds me of the jdrama Shinigami-san (banger btw), where everything was so blue, you would think James Cameron directed it. Anyways, I think I liked the premiere? As expected, so much trauma for completely innocent ppl minding their own business, but that's the nature of a melodrama... I can't blame this drama for having what a melo is supposed to have. But I personally am not a fan of such plot, I'm just here for the FL and cause I'm bored, so idk if I will continue watching but let's see the second episode...\n\nWow, ML is disgustingly complicit. I so want the FL to take her revenge, which is like the only incentive I have to continue watching.\n\nEp. 2: ok you know what, I really enjoyed the second episode! I like how despite all the shit that FL goes thru, she isn\u2019t defeated, she\u2019s always so combative and always picks herself up. She reminds me a lot of Lee Ji-eun from My Mister. I still dislike the ML as a person but let\u2019s see where this goes. The question is, &gt;!how aware is he of the bakchodi his mom pulled? he has to be aware somewhat. the fact he was like, im not interested in other ppl\u2019s misery, made me wanna strangle him. your mom caused so much of ppl\u2019s misery bro T-T!&lt;\n\nWhy are the flashbacks squished?

It's somewhat satisfying to watch.\n\n- how both leads are sooo bad at stalking people. LSK \"hiding\" in front of the convenience store was hilarious (although it probably wasn't meant to be funny)\n\n- the prospect of seeing LSK and Hani together at some point\n\n- the cinematography - some of the angles and editing choices are so pretty and interesting \n\nI'm somewhat confused by:\n\n- the color grading - I seems to turn more intense in flashbacks but even in present time it's *very* pink. \n\n- a lot of the side characters. What is going on with the sister and the best friend? Are all of them living at his house? Why did the ML start a company with that bumbling idiot who bought the G-Wagon? I thought it was his brother at first but it seems like he isn't.\n\n- the English subtitles also seem really off. They are just the written version of the dubs, so it makes sense that they aren't terribly accurate, but it makes me miss Viki subs.\n\n\nOverall I'm confused but mildly invested so I'll probably keep watching.",

The \"revenge\" set-up was nice and economical - didn't drag out the backstory and you immediately get why she's so angry.\n\nAlso really love the ML - he's dour and withdrawn, but clearly for a reason. We can only guess at the reason so far, but dude has issues. And the FL will be there for them to work things out with him. I love it!\n\nI also love the metaphor of the opening sequence - a colorful picture covered in black, with the title of show shown in scraped-off letters - some color being salvaged from the darkness. \"Finding love in a hopeless place\" metaphor.\n\nTHE BAD: The overwhelming PINK filter - not a fan. I thought my TV was broken.\n\nI noticed that Disney+ does this. *Shadow Detective* was very green. *Revenge of Others* was too blue. Do they need their Korean dramas color-coded or something?",

And how she fights for her family as much as she does\u2026but she\u2019s also not perfect. She\u2019s abrasive, rude and prickly but it works. I like seeing this actress in this type of role I admit, I don\u2019t like the over the top acting etc. It is nice seeing her in this type of role.\n\nML, I suspect we don\u2019t know the entire story about him &gt;!taking the money from his mom to save his business etc. I also think he might know who she actually is, but maybe I\u2019m giving him too much credit haha.!&lt;\n\nML is just my type so I\u2019m swooning at every scene\u2026the way he looked at FL at the end, his eyes tell it all. He\u2019s fallen for her and hard. God I love a we shouldn\u2019t be together romance\u2026",

He doesn't seem to have enough executive function/interest in the world around him right now to pretend &gt;!he doesn't know who she is out of a sense of guilt/responsibility!&lt;. And the drama has been hitting us with little moments that I just know WILL be replayed as flashbacks &gt;!when he finds out the truth and looks back on all the clues he missed!&lt;, like Woojoo's repeated mentions of the house she grew up in, the trees in the front yard, her telling him she was in an honest mood and would answer any questions he had for her at the grocer and him saying he wasn't curious, her saying &gt;!he'd regret rehiring her!&lt;, etc. I also think the eventual revelation will be the big trial of their relationship &gt;!not just because of the guilt he'll feel but also because of his preexisting trust issues due to his ex cheating on him, which Woojoo's stupid hidden identity plot will trigger. So it will be doubly hard to take.!&lt;\n\nBut to your other point, I totally agree we don't know the whole story &gt;!behind the house!&lt;. Firstly, &gt;!why did his mother move into the house she had supposedly sold previously? If she didn't sell it, where did she find money to give Dongjin? Where does her new wealth come from?!&lt; Honestly, I think Woojoo should have retained a lawyer &gt;!to contest the will!&lt; instead of &gt;!coming up with this convoluted revenge-on-the-wrong-person plan!&lt; because &gt;!the eviction!&lt; was very sus. I suspect we may find out &gt;!her father actually left the house to her and her siblings and HDJ's mother stole it somehow.!&lt; And EVEN IF &gt;!the will was real!&lt;, it sounds like the kind of thing that could be argued in court for several reasons.\n\n(But I also get why she would be mad at Dongjin, who did go through life without wondering if his mother's relationship was causing misery to other people and even reaped the fruits of that relationship and deliberately decided not to ask any questions. As I said, I'm sure he'll feel a lot of guilt about that once it all comes out.)\n\nI really like both leads too, and the romantic setup is delicious.",

He doesn't seem like a bad person, just someone who is struggling and numb to the world, so I know once he feels more like himself he'll feel guilty for not asking her any questions when she practically told him to (and for his role in her family's ruination).",

KYK is also great, and I interested how the plot will work out between characters. \n\nBut apart from this annoying pink filter (yes, I am not a fan ether), everything about this was amazing.

Yeah, she's had to deal with crappy people and abandonment, but she her response is to be petty about it. I know growth from adversity is an overused trope but I can't help but wish it were invoked here. Her whole attitude towards the world seems...bitchy? She looks like she has strong RBF to me so it doesn't help her case. It's hard to root for a character like that IMO!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The ML feels uninteresting. I know the show has time to develop characters, but the first episode is also the time to hit us viewers hard and draw us in. I can't help but use the word boring to describe him. There's nothing wrong with quiet leads...but I feel like we were given so little information about him!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Even the cinematography feels off to me. Muted lightning is kinda melodrama 101 but not EVERY scene has to be like that. The most awkward scenes were the ones were they were outside and you could see the sun shining brightly. The whole thing ended up feeling like I was watching a video that had been edited to be overexposed. I'm being picky now, but there was one scene with such weirdly jarring editing/a really noticably unnatural scene transition - when FL was walking out of the funeral hall to cry, it cut to black instead of being edited as a continuous scene!&lt;\n\nThis ended up being a much more scathing review of Ep1 than I intended...I guess I have high expectations for melodramas and didn't feel this show met them.",

                            "comment": "I don't even think she's a bitch as much as she's a nutjob, which is a different kdrama archetype. Her brand of 'bitchiness' is interesting because it's not coded as particularly feminine. She's very direct and aggressive, has a lot of pride that she clings to even when it would be better to swallow it, assumes responsibility for her siblings like she's the head of the family, doesn't allow herself to cry, etc. These are all stereotypically masculine traits in kdrama land. Also when her sister was harassed at work, Woojoo dealt with it in a reasonable and dignified yet assertive manner instead of the stereotypical 'bitchy' approach, which would have been to grab the woman by the hair. (We've seen plenty of that in kdramas, and it can have its own charm!) She was also quite reserved at &gt;!her dad's funeral!&lt;, at least until she learned &gt;!she'd just been evicted!&lt;. (And even the confidence to go there in a miniskirt and high heels as a form of provocation showed a lack of self-consciousness about her sexuality, whereas most kdrama heroines nowadays are prudish and protective of their virtue. She was wielding her femininity as a weapon, but the confidence with which she did it was unconventional by kdrama standards and reminded me of older kdramas, which featured more sexually empowered/liberated women who contested male authority on its own terms instead of escaping its reach in pockets of female community.)\n\nI'm not saying her character is masculine\u2014I don't think personality is inherently gendered\u2014but that it's masculine-**coded** within the universe of kdramas, which tend to trade in rigid gender stereotypes.\n\nI think part of the reason for this has already been alluded to; apparently &gt;!Woojoo is averse to romantic relationships with men and doesn't trust them because of what her father did to her family!&lt;. So she's completely uninterested in a major aspect of traditional femininity. She's also had to take on the traditionally masculine (in Korean society) role of primary breadwinner and decision-maker for her family, as I mentioned previously. \n\nAt the same time, in addition to rejecting conventional femininity, she has the tough, blunt demeanour associated with poor people in kdramas. She did grow up with some measure of financial security because she had a house, but &gt;!she had to give up on university to pay her mother's hospital bills!&lt; and has been bouncing from low-paid job to low-paid job for years.\n\nIn conclusion, she's a bit non-traditional compared to the heroines we've been seeing in recent years, and has a pretty well-defined personality as a crazy asshole rather than a bitch.\n\nWith all that said, I don't even think she's that unpleasant to the people around her. It's only been two episodes and &gt;!she's already starting to soften toward the ML in small ways!&lt;, and there have been indications that she has a strong sense of morality. Her thirst for revenge seems like a cover for a deep sense of hurt and betrayal that could be soothed by a sincere apology. And when that condescending co-worker showed a bit of humility in front of her, she immediately caved and offered to wash her mug. It seems to me she's someone who will be very good to people if they are good to her.",

In service industry. The first thing which you learn in such job is attitude towards client especially in such country like Korea. After so many years of experience she would have fake smile on the face as habit.\n\nThat could be eventually realistic if she has good, permanent job. Or like IU in My ahjussi, character who is young, introverted and got job in the office through some social programme.",

It could be as \"out there\" as time travel (**Tomorrow With You**) or just a typical thing like parental issues (**When the Weather is Fine**). There always end up being lead-to-lead heart-to-hearts or tense, serious discussions (which in fairness, show up in a lot of Kdramas)\n\n-Creation of a muted environment: the scenes tend to be more subdued (This show is taking it to an extreme with an always-on-editing-filter). You're generally going to see less vibrant colors, etc. The OSTs are usually ballads/emotional songs.\n\n-Some slice of life elements: there are scenes, especially establishing shots where the characters are just doing \"everyday stuff\" like buying groceries, etc.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI like them because they tend to lean hard on realism/realistic elements, while being unrealistic (melodrama by definition is exaggerated emotions). There are other melodramas which I think are their own genres (Makjangs are essentially Revenge Melodramas)",

I find that pretty much in every romance kdrama there is the almost obligatory part where the couple splits up for one reason or another before getting back together.  Personally, I hate that and just white-knuckle my way through that.   Sometimes the reason makes sense, but often it's inexplicable, like Love in Contract  Ugh.  Or just drags on like in I am not a Robot.\n\nCould it also be the absence of comedic moments?  But I hear you.  A more serious tone.  And I guess less of a chance for a happy ending?  Although DDSSLLS taught me to always be on my guard.",

I think the difference between, rom coms and melo, for me, is that melo is more somber, less comedy or light and fuffyness that romcoms have, a lot more staring at each other, or one scene where they just stand there, and the scene goes on for ages or maybe a bit more of a crazy storyline at times. I think melo is more about the characters/relationship development and the atmosphere of the show. But also can have a more of a realistic tone , which is good too. I think a lot of people don't always like the melo's are it's a bit more real life and less happiness. Generally the characters are living a tough life and a lot of people don't want to see this as they watch kdramas for escapism from a tough life.\nI would imagine, that from a actors/actresse point of view, that doing a melo is good for career development as it might get to show their acting range.",

I get it that hurt people behave like this, it is as form of defensive but we have to at least empathize with such character if not like. But here is a problem: production come up with obvious references to My ahjussi even from visual perspective. But this mismatch with actress, character's situation and set.\n\nLee Sung-Kyung's looks can't be called average. Unique beauty, model's height and body, even unique eyes' colour lol.  Of course she wear oversize clothes, has a bit \"prosecutor\" hair in tail. But at the same time her hair are dyed in well matching colour, eyebrows are also made. In case of such beauty it is really hard to buy it by viewers unless you are not going Anna's strict realistic way (it was first drama which made Suzy believable looking as poor character).\n\n Of course their family story is sad but they are not poor even when they lost beautiful house. They live in pretty house of their friend. It looks match better than even in My liberation notes. All of them are also grown up except brother with job.\n\nSo it is really hard to emphasize with her character because she doesn't look to be in such tragic situation which could excuse her pretty rude character (it is her own words lol).",

It is crucial thing especially for series to be watchable for most viewers (it is easier to watch 2h film with main character who you don't like than 16h drama, right). \n\nSo if main character has obvious unlikable traits you have to well explain, excuse or show even worse people lol. Great example is main character of Breaking bad who became drug dealer because he has cancer, disabled son and for many irritating wife.\n\nLooks obviously play role as well. For Dexter not coincidentally was chosen actor who looks like very nice guy. It is easier to viewers like serial killer this way.\n\nSo looks, background of character and overall set up play role how much we can forgive character. It is obvious easier to forgive stealing money from work young , nice looking adult who everyday struggle financially than mean looking chaebol who steal for fun. Even if in both cases their action could cost other people's jobs.",

I find the story to be a try hard melo. It's more like a romanticize family conflict and doesn't feel authentic. And the acting is really not convincing, sometimes it becomes over dramatic. I'm still at episode 1 so maybe ep. 2 will change my opinion. But i have barely no interest now to watch episode 2. \ud83d\ude05",

Definitely dipping into makjang territory with some of the acting and music choices. \n\nFeels like this takes place in the apartments across the street from Green Mothers Club but they go to lunch with SKY Castle. \n\nThere's so many kdramas about rich overzealous mothers that its hard NOT to compare. I hope this show will be able to push through and find its own standout color. \n\nThings I noticed: (1) That Instagram comment saying the little girl sounds like a man when she sings was wildly hilarious. (2) The child actors are working so hard with these English lines. It's brutal.(3) The dynamic between the two FLs was so hard to pin down. Maybe that was on purpose???\n\nAnyway I think it'll be a decent turn-your brain-off-and-watch kinda show. So no major complaints from me.",

            "comment": "I just completed the first two episodes and really enjoyed it! I would describe this as a 'delicious' watch so far.\n\nA few initial thoughts:\n\n1. So far it feels like a thriller combining Sky Castles x The Penthouse x a little bit of The Glory with the past lives of &gt;!the two female leads!&lt; intertwined.\n2. Key themes: old secrets and scandals that come back to haunt the leads, super competitive mothers, toxic/super competitive social media personas trying to outdo each other to show who has a happier life, rich families that live in the same buildings and send their kids to the same pre schools, secret affairs.\n3. The acting has been really solid. The show has a bit of a 'light-makjang' feel but I think the great acting helps elevate this from entering into full makjang territory.\n4. My key gripe would be the inconsistency in some of the characters' behaviour: one minute they are angry with someone, in the next scene they are friendly and warm, one minute one character (the overdressed mom) is all fiery, aggressive and confrontational then in a following scene she is cowering in front of Oh Yu Jin. I wish there was more consistency in the character development because it's these types of hiccups that take you out of a fully engaging drama.\n\nThat said, I am definitely staying on for the next few episodes. Pacing has been fantastic, no filler scenes. And both La El and Park Hyo Joo have been excellent in their roles. It's a riveting show so far and if that was on Netflix, this would be getting so much attention and interest.",

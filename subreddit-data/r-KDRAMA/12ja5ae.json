Like the production quality is great, the humour lands mostly\u2026\n\nwhile it feels like Yoo In-na is playing the adorable romcom heroine she usually does, I was mostly impressed with the ML\u2019s storyline. Not because I like the character - he\u2019s an entitled jerk - but that final scene was amazing; great acting, so brutal, so real and so well deserved. Hoping he gets engaging character development over the next few episodes. &gt;!Although if the previews are anything to go by, he hasn\u2019t internalized what his ex said and just blames Bo-ra instead.  !&lt;  \n\n\nEp. 2: I could watch another 50 minutes of Bo-ra and Su-hyeok just verbally sparring and her putting him in his place. &gt;!Guy really didn\u2019t internalize anything, just blames it all on Bo-ra. Why does he think his ex sent the message in the first place? she must have been unhappy for a while!&lt;\u2026 bro is just onto nothing. Character development can\u2019t come soon enough, tho I think next week we\u2019ll see his more decent side.\n\nI love all of Bo-ra\u2019s daydreams and how elaborate they get. They did it a lot, but I was dying every time &gt;!she imagined he was gonna propose!&lt;, with the expectations vs reality bit and the music stopping &amp; starting\u2026 comedy gold.\n\nI last watched Yoo In-na in Queen In-hyun\u2019s Man and a bit of Goblin &amp; Love from the Star. She is just as beautiful and adorable as she was back then. &gt;!I can\u2019t imagine how anyone can cheat on her but somehow men find the audacity.!&lt;\n\nher sister is another person I can\u2019t stand. She is so entitled and spoiled, I would be happy to have less of her scenes. And army dude, \u201csaving\u201c a woman doesn\u2019t mean you are entitled to her and can follow her around\u2026\n\nanyways, overall, I liked the second episode a bit less but I\u2019m still hyped for this drama. next week can\u2019t come soon enough.",

At this point, she can sub for IU as In Na's real life bff. lol\n\nThe break up scene at the end was brutal and he deserved it. lol Hyun Min's actong was pretty solid and though he was a jerk, how he showed his love language at then end was a nice touch. But why did they have to make Joo Sang Wook's character obnoxious and caricature like? That Steve Jobs schtick was so cringe! Haha If he's going to be the love triangle, I couldn't take him so seriously. And it's enough to have Chan Sung as the obnoxious ex. Having two is kinda overkill.

From him mocking Deborah's solution on-air to realising that he's in fact *the man* in the question- it was so well-portrayed! That breakup was so satisfyingly brutal, Lee Soo-hyuk totally deserved it and I can't wait to see how his character grows. \n\nAnd Yoo In-Na is just back at it- doing her thing like the glamorous romcom queen she is.

I think she will likely learn to be slightly less prescriptive or simplistic with her advice and potentially see a little more nuance. Honestly the advice she gave to the GF of the male lead was exactly correct though and even he realized when he heard the segment, so the show may also show her advice helping some of the men in the show step up and behave better toward women.  \n\n\nI don't think she's really said anything 'quackish' but these shows usually try to strike a middle ground between the 'expert' humbling other people and being humbled, and here it seems like one of the 'lessons' she will learn is just doing everything 'right' won't actually guarantee you the relationship you want.",

I think if you need to beg and browbeat someone to 'show you signs of commitment' then you will never feel secure with them anyway. Those signs of commitment should be freely given to really 'count' as signs of real commitment. This was touched upon in Bora's 2nd radio speech about the cheating - even if you give someone a chance, you will always be anxious and suspicious, and it will feel suffocating, and you won't get that trust back.\n\nSpending holidays together (but never celebrating anniversaries), taking care of someone when they're sick, meeting up when they ask - these are all things that friends do. He never told her he loved her (in 4 years!), teased her and joked about how she should tell him if she's dating other guys, said he never intended to get married, etc. Even if unintentional he basically withheld all signs of commitment and exclusivity from her and made her feel constantly insecure about the status and future of their relationship. Even if she had told him how she felt, he could have just 'told her what he thought she wanted to hear' and she would likely not feel better about it. Always being the one chasing, showing love, and nagging someone to do things for you that are supposed to be voluntary and spontaneous (like saying I love you) will make anyone feel bad, but especially a woman in a society with pretty traditional dating norms and gender roles in relationships.\n\nThis is why what Bora said rang true to BOTH Yuri and ML, because I think they both realized there was a problem. If he was really doing everything in his power to express love and commitment that radio segment wouldn't have rattled him as much as it did.\n\nI think after 4 years of ambiguity it's too late to give someone advice to 'just communicate' since clearly there was something preventing her from wanting to communicate these things in the first place. She only worked up the courage to communicate those feelings after she had accepted the relationship wasn't working for her, but prior to that she felt like she was walking on eggshells trying not to jeopardize what they had by calling him out.  \n\n\nETA: The first thing ML says to Yuri when she sits down (even though he just read the books/heard the radio segment) is 'were you on a date? why so pretty, dressed up?' and then 'are you getting married?'  \n\n\nI think if it wasn't for him saying this she may not have broken up with him right then and there, but you can see her face fall and that's when she decides to confront him. He's probably just trying to tease her, but to her this is a clear sign that he doesn't consider them a couple. It goes beyond 'lack of clear communication' into outright counterproductive and deceptive communication when in addition to not establishing your relationship status you button push your partner with teasing like this implying your relationship is 'open.' She then also says 'I come on too strong don't I, I shouldn't impose on you... I was clingy' implying that she has been the one doing most of the communication/asking to meet up (mirrored in what he said at the bar), and that he hasn't reciprocated.",

The ML believes in sincere emotion and doesn\u2019t think love should be treated as transactional or a game of winners and losers, which is right, but he used this belief as a justification to be selfish and take his partner for granted. The FL has a more practical view of relationships as something that has to be negotiated and actively maintained, but she endorses manipulative tactics that keep one\u2019s partner at arm\u2019s length emotionally and turn the relationship into a constant performance. They\u2019ll obviously have to meet in the middle.",

It seems like she's being presented as someone with pretty good instincts about OTHER PEOPLE'S relationships as an outsider but someone who isn't very sensitive to her own deeper feelings and needs.  \n\n\nI'm not sure where you're getting the idea that her attitude is transactional or even that he thinks it is transactional though. He buys her books and takes her advice because he sees himself in what was said about 'bad boys' and thinks her advice is good, and the radio segment said nothing about transactionality, only about openly and consistently showing your love and commitment to your partner so they feel appreciated and secure rather than anxious and uncertain. The problem is he hasn't expressed his sincere emotion to his gf, not that he doesn't want love to be transactional.  \n\n\nThe only part where I can see people interpreting her attitude as 'transactional' was the conversation in the jewelry store, but she wasn't actually talking about transactionality there. She was saying that a romantic gift typically means something (to the buyer and receiver) or is meant to communicate something and that 'just because' gifts of jewelry are kind of a copout or manipulative (which I think she is largely right about, at least before a relationship is established which his isn't). But she never expresses this as buying someone off or anything like that, just as assurance or a communication of intent.",

However, the quotes the ML pulled out of her books when he was browsing the bookshop were mostly pretty bad. They were all about playing mind games and manipulating your partner into doing things for you instead of communicating with them openly and treating them as your equal. Her attachment to heteronormative stereotypes about passive and active parties and relationship expectations is an obstacle to effective communication and that\u2019s reflected in her own relationship quite clearly. It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t take her own advice but rather that she lives by it. She\u2019s totally right that relationships need to be negotiated and to provide security/meet both parties\u2019 needs, but she thinks women need to perform constantly and nudge/train/manipulate their partners into doing what they want instead of being emotionally honest. One consequence of Bora\u2019s disregard for the importance of emotional intimacy is her willingness to settle for a guy whose company she doesn\u2019t enjoy at all.\n\nThe ML has his own set of harmful hangups, of course. They\u2019ll have to learn from each other and grow together. But I definitely don\u2019t agree Bora\u2019s relationship attitudes are healthy and beyond criticism like so many people in this comment section seem to think. That\u2019s a huge misreading of the message the drama has tried to convey so far IMO.",

So I saw it as more of a 'don't always put your all into a relationship where your bf puts no effort back' kind of thing.\n\nETA: maybe I just relate to the part about the gifts because I've been there when I was younger and 'cooler' about these things, and convinced myself at first that I was OK with always giving more and never getting any of these 'traditional' signs of affection back while my friends did from their partners. It was way too late by the time I realized it had blown up into a much bigger thing over time and that I could never really feel 'secure' in the relationship anymore, so I related to the Yuri character in ep. 1 and I actually think it's a good thing that &gt;!ML didn't give her the ring!&lt;, because it would probably be too late at that point for her to feel like it was sincere.",

I didn't see it as advising anyone to play mind games but I saw them as an expression of the 'if he wants to, he will' attitude of a lot of modern dating advice which basically translates to don't be desperate, or don't constantly be chasing a guy who isn't showing signs of affection or commitment in return. She specifically mentioned the pain of getting a guy gifts that he never returns and says to just receive gifts instead, which seems more like advice to women who are always 'doing more' in the relationship than advice to NEVER give anything (we see her attitude about this isn't super heteronormative in ep 2 where she decides to &gt;!propose herself!&lt;).   \n\n\nWhen she talks about a guy who doesn't care for diamonds himself getting a girl a ring anyway when he's in love it's basically 'if he wants to, he will' aka 'if he thinks you're the one, he will do these things to make you feel secure even if he's not the type to do it normally.' I actually think this is good advice, because a lot of players (men and women both) or people with commitment issues will use 'I'm not the type to do X' as a way to string people along when they would do those things in a heartbeat if they felt it was the right relationship. This was the cause of &gt;!ML's breakup!&lt; after all - his gf didn't feel secure or loved because he was playing it too cool.  \n\n\nI agree she could emphasize effective communication more but words mean less than actions and people who are told the 'right words' will often end up feeling insecure anyway if words don't match actions. I also think viewers should keep in mind this show is set in SK which places more emphasis on traditional dating norms and gender roles than a lot of Western countries so men in SK not doing these things for their gfs is likely more unusual there than in, say, the US.  \n\n\n&gt;she thinks women need to perform constantly and nudge/train/manipulate their partners into doing what they want instead of being emotionally honest. One consequence of Bora\u2019s disregard for the importance of emotional intimacy is her willingness to settle for a guy whose company she doesn\u2019t enjoy at all.\n\nI totally agree with this part of what you said but I interpreted it a little differently - I think she probably hasn't consciously realized that she's unhappy/\"settling\" because she's an independent career woman who spends lots of time at work and with friends, and also because she is viewing her relationship through the lens of her work and needing to 'prove' that she is good at the dating game to herself and others. I actually see it as more of an expression of her workaholic nature and lack of experience of deep love than as her knowingly 'settling.' I know lots of people who don't follow 'traditional' dating and gender norms but who still settled for relationships with people whose company they didn't enjoy that much, because they had never experienced deeper love.\n\nNotably on the radio advice she doesn't tell anyone to manipulate their boyfriends but to be straight with them and end unhappy relationships, so I think in her case she just hasn't noticed her relationship is unhappy. The monologue in the car in the 2nd ep fleshes this out a bit more - she says she liked being the one to reply 'me too' when her bf said 'I love you' 'because that's us.' So she hadn't considered making the first move because this was just the way her relationship worked, not because she thinks it's wrong for women to take initiative.\n\nI think her attitudes toward her own relationship are not very healthy (or at least they are naive/a bit hypocritical) but I interpreted this as being due to her inexperience with deeper feelings and focus on her career and life rather than because her advice is generally bad. To me the Bora character is like that girl power friend who gives her pals solid advice on how to deal with lackluster men/relationships while being inexperienced with deep feelings herself. My opinion could change later if they show more of the advice from her books but so far I didn't see any of it as objectionable.",

She said basically 'be yourself but show your cool and fun side because there are many fish in the sea and he was the one who liked you first after all.' Would you seriously recommend someone keep using different phone numbers to constantly call/keep tabs on their partner rather than either dumping them or working on their own insecurities? \n\nI think maybe she pushes the 'show only your good face' schtick a little too far but I wouldn't go so far as to call that 'toxic.' The makeup artist's behaviour was already really toxic, and she was basically just telling her to chill out and have some dignity/self respect. Showing your good face in the early stages of dating is what most people do naturally anyway, it's not like trying to show someone your good sides and also have your own life outside of the relationship is that bad a thing to do.",

Because that's def not what the subs said in the standard version.\n\nDon't love be in a relationship is fine for a dating coach - she's not a love coach but a dating coach so IMO this is appropriate, but when I watched it the subs said 'showing up late is a privilege of a spoiled girlfriend' (nothing about standing anyone up or asserting dominance), 'cry first and cry louder' is a metaphor literally about what you said - to communicate to get what you want rather than letting someone get away with not paying any attention to you, and she DEFINITELY didn't say to dump him without a conversation on the radio show in the subs I saw.\n\nHowever a conversation would not change anything after a 4 year toxic relationship like that so she was right to say to break up right away. Anyone who didn't tell someone in that situation to break up should be nowhere near advice-giving or human psychology. It was way too late for 'open dialogue' after 4 years of the girl being strung along and manipulated. Breaking up is the correct response to being in an unhappy relationship that hasn't been working for years, and it should be done ASAP to stop wasting both your time and your partner's time.\n\nWhen she doesn't get the proposal she wants she hints at it knowing he listens to her show, and then when that doesn't work she decides to propose herself - there is nothing wrong with either of these things lol? 99% of women don't want to be the ones to propose, which I think is understandable, but there is nothing morally wrong or manipulative about hinting at what you want and seeing if your partner is receptive. (Honestly if anything she did was wrong/naive it was to not understand that he got the hint and didn't want her, and try to propose after that instead of breaking up with him herself... but I'd consider that a fairly minor problem).",

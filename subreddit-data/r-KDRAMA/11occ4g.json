Everytime I see it, the first thing I assume is that my screen is dirty (especially if I am watching on my phone). Oh, the amount if times it made me clean my screen. \n\nHowever, it is actually real and recurring. In fact, I *Spotted* it [Here](https://postimg.cc/XrPZ3Hxs) in **The Heavenly Idol**\u00a0 and [Here](https://postimg.cc/ZvptR0J0) in **Revenge of Others** to prove once and for all it's existance. And no, I do not regret the word play. In fact, I am proud of it.\n\nI have seen it many time in k-dramas. One can assume that it is possible that it is a common birthmark in Korean population. However, while watching **Joy of Life** (a c-drama) what to I see? The familiar dot near the tip of the nose. \n\nJokes aside, I think that it is drawn to direct the viewer's eye. However, it usually has the unintended effect of making my screen cleaner.",

So a birthmark on the nose is supposed to symbolize good luck/fortune and other placements are associated with bad things. That's why some moles are regarded as more attractive but I don't know if Koreans nowadays still believe in such things.",

On the noise, near the lips, or under an eye were ones that seemed meaningful. Some people are getting them tattooed on, but most just add it with makeup.",

I'm annoyed at the way they keep describing it as some weird selective blindness as if you are extremely near-sighted but only for faces. \n\nI'm no expert here but I don't think this is how it works.  It's more akin to that feeling when you meet someone that knows you, but you have absolutely no idea who that person is.  For people with face blindness, it's like that for everyone.  They can learn to recognize you from all your other attributes, but not from your face alone.  The part of the brain that solves the puzzle of looking at a face and connecting it to a person you recognize is broken.\n\nI have nothing against the trope, but it's lazy writing from writers when they default to showing you a blurry face and call it a day.",

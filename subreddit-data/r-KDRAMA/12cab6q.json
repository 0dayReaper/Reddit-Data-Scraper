Maybe I am a greater PHS fan than I expected, regardless of the story that makes no sense and zero chemistry between the leads.\n\n**Taxi Driver S2** (12/16) Absolutely my favorite on-air series, I look forward to my weekends so I can watch the drama unfold. The latest episodes surprised me with the headline story they're tackling and I can't wait to see how they resolve this big bad to close out S2. **PLEASE S3!!**\n\n**Divorce Attorney Shin** (8/12) I'm really just interested in the backstory of Shin Sung Han but I can wait until the final few episodes are available.\n\n**Jinny's Kitchen** (6/10) The Youn's Kitchen/Stay series and now spin-off Jinny's Kitchen have always been a favorite. As Kdrama and film continues to expand across the globe it's going to be harder to locate small towns where these stars can show up with some anonymity. \n\n**Boy's Planet** (8/12) Some of the episodes are nearly 3hrs which stretches the drama out a bit too much. The performance episodes are my favorite and I fast forward through most of the results show.\n\nAnd keeping up with my favorite variety shows: **2D1N Season 4, Home Alone and My Little Old Boy** (mostly for Kim Jongmin)",

I really love how much we get to enjoy the leads in love, where so many Kdramas build tension for the whole series. And the subplot is pretty compelling, dealing with sexual harassment in the workplace (which seems culturally systemic). But the soundtrack is driving me nuts. If I hear Stand By Your Man or Save the Last Dance one more time, I might throw something at the tv! And at times it feels a bit too slow, with long shots of walking down hallways or other mundane activities. I know it\u2019s meant to build a mood, but for me it drags an already slow development. I\u2019m going to see it through, though, because there\u2019s lots to love about it and I want to see where it goes.",

I'm digging the quirkiness of the siblings (shades of My Liberation Notes \ud83d\udc93), which gives a little lightness to the melo. I was having a bit of an issue separating Dongjin from Kim Young  Kwan's character in Somebody (he was that good), but that's diminishing with each episode. \n\n**Divorce Attorney Shin** (2/12) Yeah, I'm into this for the bromance, that &gt;! home karaoke scene \ud83e\udd23 !&lt;. We'll see how Shin's story and his cases go.\n\n**The Heirs** (7/20) It's everything you all said it would be! I'm less concerned now about it being 20 eps, each ep is so silly and fun, they fly by. I love  the humor, especially between Eun Sang's mom (still/always Hacker Ahjumma to me) and Tan's mom. Kim Woo Bin is the standout, he is excellent at smarmy yet kinda hot dbag. And though I'm still  not 100% a Lee Min Ho stan, I did lol when Tan &gt;! surprised Eun Sang with his \"yeogio!\" in the wine cellar, and then when he suddenly used her as a pillow in the taxi !&lt; , I feel like he should be funny on purpose more.",

I hung on only because I loved the third relationship (Soo-ji and the hilarious CEO Ma, who were the least speechifying). \n\nJi-ho, the main FL and one of my fave actresses (Jung So-min), the heart of the show, inexplicably gets anointed around episode 12 as teller of voiceover deep truths in a flat, depressed voice, and on top of that she makes a totally inconsistent decision to &gt;!leave the relationship because Se-hee needs to learn to express his emotions, but she does this right after he beats up the guy who assaulted her, kisses her and is finally starting to open up to her. It didn't make sense and it only made me dislike her.!&lt;\n\nI was an English major too but to devote the final minutes of the drama to quoting Goethe and Gary Becker?

OBS didn\u2019t have a lot of actors yet, they portrayed the characters so well that you don\u2019t get sick of always seeing them on screen. it\u2019s a mix of ex-lovers, who thought they would\u2019ve ended up together, and are now navigating their adults lives intertwined together. they were once each others\u2019 hope, and knowing how sad they still live while apart, only showed how destined they truly are. the color palette and aesthetic of this seoul-set drama in a small village is not very overwhelming for me. \n\nand lastly; i still have so much but the drama that i felt very connected to WTCB is the currently trending in all platforms, **Crash Course in Romance**. \n\n **Crash Course in Romance** (2023): \nactors are also critically acclaimed and applauded in korea. i mean, we have the cannes film fest first ever korean panel, miss Jeon Do Yeon, who plays the great superhero mom and ex-olympian Nam Haeng-seon-ssi. and then comes, Jung Kyung Ho, the #1 Top Math Instructor, who can only tolerate Haeng-seon\u2019s food and no one else\u2019s. the two incredibly forms great chemistry for their kid and students. i haven\u2019t watched a genuinely feel-good and FUN (ML are entertaining af) drama.",

This drama was a major downer because it\u2019s such a talented cast who did a wonderful job. Idk even know how to properly construct my thoughts about this in a concise manner. No character establishment or development. Inconsistencies on all levels. Characters suddenly emotional about things we never saw developed. Characters being introduced wildly throughout the entire 16 episodes. No clear understanding of what the plot even is or what we\u2019re supposed to be following. Several plot lines get introduced and then just completely never mentioned again or when mentioned, it was nonchalantly overlooked, like the murder investigation that was half of season one. Just the worst writing structure for a show, not just for a kdrama.",

It constantly didn't know what kind of drama it wanted to be or what the main plot was. No tone established. They definitely gave it a go with \"we've got to make the situation high stakes by making the characters dispensable\" and it doesn't work because we don't care about or know these characters to begin with. There's no substance to it.",

Or did I misunderstand his conversation with Jo afterwards when he goes to pick up the verdict?\n\nif they keep this style up - it might be the element of the \"legal\" plotline that keeps me from rolling my eyes. it seems the writing just might be smart enough to know how to play around with the law plotline in the sense that WDH is more a political player than he is a genius attorney. He knows what social and political vulnerabilities to play in the court that all but force the judge to choose his position more than that he is taking the law seriously. He's a skilled showman. That's all. To me, that's  a reasonable and sound baseline to explain his legal successes. Sadly or not, showman skills are more important than \"true\" political and legal acumen.\n\nAnd in doing this - as a viewer - it's comforting because it doesn't force us to be idiots watching legal improbabilities be sold as \"legal brilliance\" (this is my trigger- when the drama tries to sell to the viewer flagrant abuse of court practice or obviously weak arguments as REALLY GOOD).",

ML is a consummate liar and thus an unreliable narrator, but he has way too much general expertise to be just winging it. \n\nIf he is just winging it, that's kind of a ridiculous amount finesses for him to always be maneuvering and making the right guesses at the right time, which is still a variation of the genius lawyer trope. I watch a lot of legal Kdramas - it's one of my favorite genres - so I admit I have a low tolerance for it in any permutation.",

I'd say realistic 'good' lawyers are the ones that don't always win, have their work/methodology shown instead of just implied and they improve over time vs having the same skill-set from beginning to end of the drama.\n\nFor legal dramas that have lawyers that fit that criteria, I'd recommend:\n\n* **I Hear Your Voice** (2013): FL experiences some tragedy and injustice as a kid and grows up to become jaded public defender who got her job for the steady government paycheck. She's a mediocre lawyer who believes the system is broken, and she doesn't really think she can do better until she meets ML (a victim of greater tragedy and injustice), her childhood rival SFL (who's now a prosecutor) and her idealistic, naive co-worker SML.\n \nSouth Korea underwent a massive legal reform in 2008 that brought jury trials, public defenders and the modern evidentiary process to the legal system. IHYV highlights all of these changes with a side of noona romance, supernatural powers and a serial killer with a vendetta. It's a timeless classic.\n\n* **Diary of a Prosecutor** (2019): ML is a middling prosecutor on the lowest performing team in the smallest, semi-rural district court in South Korea. He's a compassionate slacker content with his low-key, laid back life and approach to the law until his ex-classmate and rival FL - a hotshot from Seoul transferred due to politics - is assigned to his team and stirs things up. \n\nDOAP is more legal slice of life with a side of societal issues. No courtroom grandstanding, no revenge, no makjang tropes; but it's funny and heartwarming and both ML and FL become better at their jobs through the slow attrition of trying to prove that they have the best legal/life methodology.\n\nHonorable mentions to:\n\n* **The Good Wife** (2016): A remake of the US series, condensed with a happier ending for everyone involved. FL is an ex-lawyer who returns to her career to support her family after her husband is implicated in a corruption scandal.\n* **Juvenile Justice** (2022): FL is a judge in the juvenile court with some complicated feelings about juvenile offenders and the system; she's tenacious but no genius.\n* **Miss Hammurabi** (2018): One of the only legal Kdramas written by an actual judge; FL is an idealistic and somewhat bumbling rookie judge in the Seoul civil circuit court.\n* **Solomon's Perjury** (2016): High school students take the law into their own hands after being ignored by the administration and hold a trial investigating the death of one of their classmates.",

I was not a huge fan of the FL, but I enjoyed the ML and his dynamic with her. The 2ML and 2FL's story was entertaining, too. As a whole, it has funny scenes, which makes it all the more wild. The only thing it was missing for me was attachment to the characters. At the end of the day, I finished the drama and felt no love for the characters. I didn't mind parting from them. 7.5/10. I would recommend it.\n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n* \\*\\*Taxi Driver 2 (12/16)\\*\\* \u2014 Don't care about it. 4 more episodes left, and I wish we were done already. \n* \\*\\*Kingdom 2 (5/6)\\*\\* \u2014 So close to the finish line, so I'll take this chance to say how great the pacing is. Seriously, if anyone is into zombies and thrillers, this is one of the best dramas. There's always something happening. I am scared to go to the last episode, but I must.\n* \\*\\*Mystic Pop-Up Bar (4/12)\\*\\* \u2014 I quite like this drama. I would say it gives me Hotel Del Luna vibes, except I like HDL more so far. However, I'm still intrigued by a lot of things, and I have questions about ALL the mains. It's a drama that keeps me watching out of pure curiosity. Also, the FL is great! I love her. Sungjae's character is boring, but I can look past it since the FL has my attention.\n* \\*\\*Joseon Attorney: A Morality (2/16)\\*\\* \u2014 Okay, listen, I am biased here cause, if you can see my flair, I'm a huge Woo Do Hwan fan. Such a versatile actor, and this was his comeback drama. The trailers did not sell me on this show, but I watched it for him regardless. I will say, first episode did not hook me as much, but the second episode was great. The real highlight of this drama is WDH's character, Kang Han Su. He is such an eccentric man. He's a jerk, and he plays dirty, but he's likeable. Once I knew his intentions in episode 2, I was in. Not only that, but WDH has never made these types of facial expressions, body movements, and fast speeches in any other dramas (or movies) I've seen him in. He's so fun and so extra, too. I would recommend anyone checking it out just for his acting.\n* \\*\\*Our Blooming Youth (18/20)\\*\\* \u2014 So close! 1 week left, and I'm glad some things are coming together. While I still am not a fan of the drama as a whole, I am here for the 2FL and 2ML. They're so adorable.",

Compared to 2022, where only 1/4 of the dramas are below 7.5 it's not exactly a standout. So a large part of the phenomena of 2017 is simply that some of those dramas became fan favorites for international viewers. Most of them didn't rate as highly in South Korea; **While You Were Sleeping** has an 8.7 but it never even hit double digits in average viewership when it aired and ditto for **Chicago Typewriter**.",

Kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I laughed, cried and gasped. Def one of the best dramas I\u2019ve watched. It\u2019s on my favorites list.\n\nThis is my 2nd drama w/Yeo Jin Goo. Who was just beyond amazing in this drama. My 1st drama w/him was Hotel del Luna, which I loved. \n\nI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be one for Historical dramas but this my 2nd one so far that I\u2019ve loved. Mr. Queen was my first \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\nThe episodes for TCC are about 1hr-1.25. Makes a nice weekend binge or a nightly watch. But def stick with it, if you watch the 1st episode. It picks up in E2. You\u2019ll like it I promise.",

I love stories like this about a whole community of tight-knit characters, where you root for everyone. I don't feel a rush to finish this drama--I wouldn't want to binge it. It's nice to spend time with everyone.\n* **Summer Strike** (8/12). I love Im Siwan (Run On and then Misaeng were the first kdramas I watched). I sort of feel like I could stop here and end this drama when everything is mostly fine and happy because I hear it diverges into a murder mystery plotline next, so I'm not too keen on that, but I will probably try to finish this one soon.\n* **The Eighth Sense** (2/10). Loved the first two eps. Very excited to watch the new episodes tonight!! Nice cinematography and subtle storytelling. And the 30 min runtime is great. Not too short, not too long.\n* **XX** (8/10). Almost done with this one. I haven't really connected with any of the characters. I do like the shorter episodes, and I mainly started this one for Bae Inhyuk after watching **At a Distance Spring Is Green**, but it's meh. Nothing too bad, but nothing to write home about. I thought there would be more female friendship, but there hasn't been much so far...\n\nFinished\n\n* **A Shoulder to Cry On** (7/7). I really liked the first 5 episodes!! Enemies to friends to \"we're just friends\"/more-than-friends. The springtime, high school setting. I had a great time. But the ending did not hold up. &gt;!Very unnecessary time skips smh.!&lt;\n* **Jack 'o Frost** (6/6). I really enjoyed this Japanese BL. But really just because it was beautiful to watch, really well made, nice to look at. The storyline was sort of underwhelming, but you could really look past that for the most part haha. The cozy sweaters and that giant scarf that Ritsu wears is the mvp. I haven't seen many jdramas, but it had the same vibes as **Silent**, so very good.\n* **Our Dating Sim** (8/8). I must admit that I wasn't as big of a fan of this one in the beginning, but the ending really landed so well. The really short, 15-min episode I think is the main problem for me, but they handled it well. Cute story, good ending.",

And V is adorable. \n\n**Memory of the encaustic tile** - C drama I watched two episodes, because I saw somewhere that it is similar to ARRTI but I am not feeling the vibe yet, so not sure If I will continue.",

Park Sung-woong is great of course, lots of funny moments, and the premise is interesting; but I can't stand all these assumptions/lies/misunderstandings between the ML and FL. Just not my cup of tea for romance.\n\nBad Thief, Good Thief (22/50) - The mystery and crime I am totally here for but *wow* about 6-7 episodes in at least 70% of the show has just become a ridiculous love square with every one being jealous and wishy washy about their feelings. So this show be *dragging*. Also Han Joon Hee is driving me absolutely nuts. I hope he tones it down at some point with the unwavering morals and crying over being alone (when it was completely *by choice*). I just wanna watch some morally grey crimes happen please \ud83d\ude29",

Or Mouse which had 22 episodes. I think all 4 seasons together have 58 episodes?\n\nAlso watched the first episode of Save Me, but i'm kinda unsure if i should watch the rest. Usually i love thrillers, but judging from the first episode, there is going to be a lot of sexual assault and rapey stuff. That's like one of the few things i really can't stomach even though i was never assaulted, this is like the worst case scenario for me. Getting killed my a serial killer or getting hunted by a monster is kinda unrealistic, but sexual assault? Real possibility, especially for a young woman like me. \n\nAlso, i'm going on vacation soon and i don't know if i will have wifi there, so i guess i have to download a lot of stuff to watch. Does Viki also have the offline viewing in europe? I could find nothing on it online, and the App i have never says that the Viki Premium Pass includes the download feature. Don't want to have to download from the pirate sites, that's a stupid way to get a virus.",

The slowburn, the anticipation and the heartbreak was just *chef\u2019s kiss* perfect.\n\nNever plan to watch it initially after seeing the trailer cos I thought its just another revenge drama with ill-fated relationship. What made me start was because I saw a few comments in this reddit saying that it\u2019s quite similar to My Mister, which I love, and how the main characters are so nuanced &amp; likable. So I gave it a try and I\u2019m glad I did despite the pink hue (which I hope is an intentional artistic choice that has something to do with the story)\n\nFor those curious about it\u2019s similarity to My Mister, it does have some parallels at the start (main leads are colleagues, FL joins as a newbie, FL is trying to destroy ML\u2019s life, ML is miserable, everyone\u2019s sad &amp; broken etc) but it eventually branched away to build up the romance and conflicts to move the plot further. It\u2019s definitely not a copy of My Mister, and can stand on its own.",

I definitely recommend if you like shows like all of us are dead, sweet home, revenge of others etc.\n\nI'm also watching the secret romantic guesthouse, this is more romance and action with a good storyline so far. One of the main leads was in Adult trainee (eps 3-5) (which is also a good and fun watch)",

Not popular by any stretch of the imagination, Dae Yeol\u2019s only real joy comes from his time spent with the archery club. A talented archer whose skills have earned him a scholarship to the school, Dae Yeol doesn\u2019t mind being an outsider, so long as he\u2019s free to pursue his greatest passion. But an ill-timed run-in with a devilishly handsome classmate lands him in trouble and places his precious scholarship in jeopardy. One of the school\u2019s most popular students, Jo Tae Hyun has always enjoyed a level of freedom that very few high school students have ever attained. Able to get away with practically anything, the entire school has no problem believing his side of the story when he\u2019s caught fooling around in the nurse\u2019s office with another student and Da Yeol. Claiming Da Yeol was trying to make out with him, Tae Hyun thoughtlessly puts the archer\u2019s scholarship at risk. Desperate to correct the misunderstanding, Da Yeol does everything he can to try to quell the rumors but no matter how hard he tries, it\u2019s just not enough. Completely unremorseful about what he\u2019s done, Tae Hyun seems to take a wicked sort of delight in doing everything he can to make Da Yeol\u2019s life miserable; his favorite method being to follow Da Yeol everywhere. Unable to shake Tae Hyun, Da Yeol spends his days loathing his shadow but the more time he spends with him, the more conflicted his feelings become; leaving him to wonder, where exactly does the line between hate and love end?

That magic Kdramas do with seemingly small gestures - I felt that when Tae Hyun flicked Da Yeol's ear while entering the class. \n\nAnother good thing is that for a change, the actors in a KBL don't look like they are straight guys trying hard to look attracted to another guy. I can totally feel Tae Hyun's yearning for Da Yeol's company and Da Yeol's fascination with a guy he should detest. This can really end up being one of the best KBLs of the year if they can maintain this quality.",

            "comment": "Ep 7 thoughts:\n\n* Does Dongjin know that the 2nd daughter is Woojoo and that the house belonged her family? Did he put two and two together and realized? They showed the flashback to Woojoo telling him about her plight at the supermarket, and he knew from the property agent that there were 3 siblings who were kicked out of the house after his mom inherited it from her dead husband... If he already knew that Woojoo was the 2nd daughter and he still stuck around and even fell for her, that's genuinely romantic imo HAHAH\n* But if he didn't know at this point (I hope he at least suspects it?), I don't think he would be too mad at her for doing what she did too, although she's ridden with guilt for misunderstanding him.\n* (EDIT: I just rewatched the part where he confronts his mother in her house and he mentioned being punished for his mother's actions so I think he is well aware that Woojoo is the 2nd daughter!!)\n* Also the trailer mislead me into thinking he found her out at the gates of the house!! I am not too disappointed though, I just hope they will talk through it by ep 12 because I DO NOT want this to be the 'final conflict' in ep 14 or smth.\n* Is anyone else confused by how Jun reacts? His reaction to Woojoo developing feelings for Dongjin is bigger than I expected? I am going to assume his anger is largely from worry and not like jealousy (maybe partly because he might feel like he is losing his best friend to some guy whose mom did her family wrong). Part of me worries that he does actually have some feelings for her (I was whispering 'nonono' at the end of the ep when I thought he was gg to suddenly burst out a confession at the noodle shop). This must be a symptom from watching too much Kdramas where any guy who has a close relationship with the FL and is not biologically related to her is actually secretly in love with \ud83d\ude02 I know he is most likely going to end up with the older sister but still...\n* Although, in the character relationship map drawn by our main leads, they described Jun as a 'brother/father-like friend' towards Woojoo. So I think even if the show is portraying him in a an ambiguous way, the truth is that the two of them are just long-time best friends.\n* (EDIT: After thinking about it, say if Jun is a woman and reacted the same way, I think we won't be wondering whether there are any romantic implications going on...)\n* Also I was just screaming the whole time Dongjin realized Woojoo stayed overnight at Minyoung's place and they basically had a breakfast date JSKDENJKBS\n\nEp 8 thoughts:\n\n* **the nile** **~~denial~~** **is a river in egypt**\n* I am not gonna lie, I always love me some resistance from characters towards love, maybe because I relate a bit to that \ud83d\ude02 It's fun though. Dongjin finds it hard to trust in love again whilst Woojoo feels like she is an immoral person and has done Dongjin wrong and doesn't deserve any of his feelings + she has too much on her plate to start a relationship... BUT THE TWO OF YALL ARE PERFECT TGTTTT\n* So does Woojoo think that Dongjin knows that she likes him? Does Woojoo know that Dongjin likes her or is that also something Dongjin assumed? I love this uncertainty\n* Miss Minyoung getting on my nerves... YOU LOST HIM PLEASE GET A LIFE SOMEWEHRE ELSE!!! And she had the audacity to be so mad that he is indifferent towards her WOAH\n* But also, I did sympathise with her when she shared her perspective towards their breakup and that she felt insecure as to whether they would even get married...But as viewers, who know that Dongjin didn't have a good relationship with his mother and most likely had a negative perspective towards marriage too (considering how often his mom remarried) so I guess it made sense why he really took his time? *But* also they were together for more than 5 years at that point so I also get why Minyoung was getting nervous.\n* CEO Choi's laughter when he realized his good friend has fallen in love HAHHAHA same honestly",

I don\u2019t think Dongjin knows who the family is, but he did realize early on that she was following him so hmmm. So confused by Jun, I love love him. I think they\u2019re totally trying to bait and switch, I really don\u2019t think he\u2019s into Woojoo but the sister, regardless of whether he like Woojoo or not that\u2019s definitely happening. Unlike you, I do want a terrible love triangle between the three leads ngl. Forgive me.                                                                                Minyoung both fills me with anger and pity. She\u2019s so stuck in the past and she drinks a concerning amount. Her scene in the bar with the other CEO where she blew up at him made me go huh? You\u2019re both going through things. She needs to set Dongjin free. I\u2019m really enjoying her portrayal, she isn\u2019t a stereotypical second female lead and it isn\u2019t easy to hate her or love her. In the flashback of their relationship, it\u2019s quite clear that they have problems. None that justifies what she did of course but she has a lot of depth. She\u2019s selfish, callous, sometimes cruel and deeply guilty.",

I feel like it was well stated she was never interested in dating and I am guessing he was almost sure that if he stuck by her, eventually she would realise her feelings for him. Then another man came into the picture and his vision shattered (he told WJ\u2019s sister he has his own reasons for not wanting to date and I think it\u2019s because he is into WJ) and that\u2019s why he became so upset to the point of threatening to call her mom and following through. I hope I\u2019m wrong. \n\nOn the Dongjin knowing WJ has feelings for him and her knowing about his feelings. I feel like he didn\u2019t know until she literally told him while drunk on that bench - she was spot on saying he keeps ignoring it and that\u2019s why SHE didn\u2019t know her feelings. I think he was in denial because she is really strange so could easily be misunderstood- he has such low self esteem I doubt he just assumed she was into him. In that same breath, I think WJ really doesn\u2019t know how he feels. If she feels ignored, he constantly thanks and apologises etc, she may feel like he really isn\u2019t interested. She said that he shouldn\u2019t like her just because that\u2019s the only way to keep herself in check, as long as he doesn\u2019t do anything she can try to deal with her feelings on her own (including the guilt for everything she has done, I have a feeling there is more to it coming - maybe some overdue consequences for her telling the ex director to step up his game ruining DJ\u2019s company). \n\nI also think DJ knows she is the daughter who was kicked out of her home. That\u2019s why he went to the conference room with her but couldn\u2019t muster up the courage to say anything. I would be surprised if he ran that quickly after getting the call about her being in her old home if that was someone other than WJ.",

She\u2019s like, you\u2019re not nice enough to me, and how dare you tell me about your feelings? This is an All Minyoung\u2019s Feelings All the Time zone. She\u2019s very pretty and the actress is doing great, but idk how we\u2019re meant to sympathise with her.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t deserve Sunwoo and I don\u2019t ship it, while I am all for the fake dating shenanigans with Jun and sis, and Woojoo defending her man like a snarling bear with a wet pet housecat\u2026",

She is Dong Jin\u2019s silent protector.\n\nI like that both of them are now aware of their own feelings and are struggling to find a way to act on them. Woo Joo\u2019s button fixing moment was her finding an outlet for her feelings and then she defiantly tells him that she will do it again. She is basically helpless and can\u2019t stop even after telling him to not fall for her.\n\nSome good moments from the rest of the cast too. Sunwoo is not totally useless. Jigu and Neil Armstrong are becoming good friends. And Hye Seong and Joon\u2019s relationship feels lived in. They do come off as lifelong friends. (Ten years, I know)\n\nMy favorite moments are both the breakfast scenes. Woo Joo being soft spoken without the hard edge probably made Dong Jin\u2019s heart race.\n\nEdited to add: I had used a lot of spoiler tags because I was the first to discuss the actual content of both episodes. I removed them now. Hope that is ok.",

He will not try to clear up the misunderstanding, will readily take the blame and let his girlfriend make a decision not to marry him. On one hand, it sounds like a noble thing to do, but as we have seen from Min Young's POV, had Dong Jin communicated his own interests and cleared up the underlying cause of said wish she would have struggled less. Now, Woo Joo told him not to confess to her and he is struggling to oblige. \n\nWoo Joo meanwhile needs assurance. She needs to know that he would be happier with her than without. She can't date him for numerous reasons but I think, she will ignore all of those if only she knew he needed her. \n\nStory wise, I think it is a great problem for the leads to to be struggle with. Compared to many dramas, the conflict here is boiled down to characters' flaws that they have exhibited throughout the show - Dong Jin was always passive and Woo Joo always leashed out instead of processing and listening to her own emotions. At this point, if one of them doesn't change they would not be together. \n\nA side note: If the siblings were to find out about Dong Jin's identity, I can see Hye Sung getting frustrated and then forgetting about it in twenty minutes and Ji Goo debating for a while and then deciding that his brother-in-law is still his hyun aka CEO Neil Armstrong.",

Thank you kind soul for doing this.\n\nI just love their journey together of finding themselves. \n\nEvery time Woo Joo is mentioned, Dong Jin just comes alive. The satisfied excited smile when her brother mentions why Woo Joo likes him, from fast walking to meet her for dinner in the last episode to running to take care of her, worrying about her, unable to take his eyes off her, calmly waiting for her to explain how and why she spent the night at his Ex\u2019s place all the while making sure she eats, finally acknowledging to his friend and himself that he has fallen for her, I could go on.\n\nWoo Joo who was mostly angry, rushing to act first than think is calming down. Thinking things through, her regret at misunderstanding him, ensuring that he gets the message to stop searching for her family, accepting she worried about him and letting him know that he shouldn\u2019t like her too much, going out of her way to look out for him, protect him, encourage him not to lose hope, being his strength, the change in her and towards him from the first episode to now is so rewarding.\n\nDong Jin\u2019s biggest fear is getting hurt again and being abandoned. Thanks to the estate lady, he will understand when he finds out Woo Joo\u2019s identity and her actions.\n\nI am glad they showed one of the reason why the ex backed out was because of his mom. In contrast I am hoping Woo Joo will stand by him despite his mother in future once they figure out they want to be together. \n\nI am shipping Joon and the sister so much though her new BF seems to be a decent guy so far. Looking forward to the sister meeting his family as his fake girlfriend. That should be fun haha\u2026\n\nI am sure they will show his reaction fully when he finds out from his staff that Woo Joo will quit soon and please let him just turn a bit to see Woo Joo shielding him from his former CEO and hopefully him fumbling to explain the hug? Pleassseeee!\n\nWednesday seems so so far away:(\n\nEdited to add:\n\nNooo, I don\u2019t want him to turn. Ex-CEO will reveal Woo Joo betrayed him first. Arrrghhhh!",

XD no fear of confrontation at all, an apex fighter. \n- \u201cI did it because it\u2019s something I can do\u201d was such a powerful line though. It caught me off guard. \n- Shim Woojoo mini smile debut!!! A win for all of us. \n- I love watching both leads fall for each other. Sunwoo\u2019s finger heart was so cute. Dongjin doth protest much. \n- So happy Dongjin said whatever his ex does doesn\u2019t affect him anymore. That\u2019s like finally attaining peace after a long breakup. \n- Woojoo freaking out as she realizes she\u2019s fallen for Dongjin\u2026 if it were a more cheerful drama the \u2018oh no, oh no, oh no no no\u2019 soundtrack would be appropriate. \n- I for real thought Jun was going to confess his feelings\u2026 idk his deal still. I\u2019d rather not have a triangle!! I like him and I don\u2019t want to see his heartbreak. \n\n\nEp 8\n- The amount of times I have been SCREECHING since this episode started !!!! \n- Omg the scene where Dongjin ran to see her outside and knelt down to wake her up !!! Bruh if I were drunk enough I\u2019d grab his face, kiss him and call it a day. \n- It\u2019s so nice she confessed. :) \n- evil CEO is ruined :) thanks ex gf I guess there\u2019s some use to you. \n- I\u2019m sorry,  I laughed when it was little bro who heard ex-gf\u2019s speech. I feel like Dongjin should have heard it (but maybe not??? With his ways he\u2019s gonna sympathize with her again)\n- DONGJIN ADMITS HE LIKES HER!! OMG. \n- OMG the end. NO WORDS. Need preview immediately. \n\nWhat great 2 episodes!!!!",

It makes for some great scenes, however Woo joo is not going to react well to that. And maybe the brother will remember and figure out where he has seen Dongjin's mother before. \n\nI enjoy the older sister and the younger guy. I feel like the show is going to pair the older sister with Jun eventually, but I am actually liking the brother's friend more at this point. \n\nI am not sure if Dongjin knows about Woojoo, but I am guessing he does not. He should suspect at this point, but I don't think he knows knows. \n\nThe mistress is definitely lying about something. My guess is she made a fake will that gave her everything when the real will prob left the kids everything. But who is the boyfriend? If he is looking for the will does that mean he wants to help Woojoo and her siblings. \n\nThey keep mentioning the mom who is living elsewhere. My guess she will show up just around the time that Woojoo and Dongjin get together. \n\nThis is my favorite of the currently airing dramas and I need the week to move faster. I do appreciate though that they drop both episodes at once.",

As a best friend, I would think it\u2019s normal to have such strong feelings about the way she feels regarding the son of the evil mother. Their friendship is very intense (they work / live together) so for me the way he reacts make sense because I would probably be upset too if it was me! They only have each other (she has her siblings) but it\u2019s just the way you feel in an intense friendship. If your best friend is hurt, you\u2019ll be hurt too and she\u2019s been hurting for more than 10 years and the whole time he was there, so he\u2019s hurt in a way too.

So why does he not buy a new one??\nMaybe it because he sees a part of himself in it? Just like how he was discarded by Minyeong after spending all his emotion and energy in his past relationship but in the end Minyeong just discarded him..\nMaybe he has discover a kind of pobia around anyting that can be discarded especially the things he uses more often thereby things that are close to him).Maybe he doesn't throw the bag away cuz it reignites the pain he felt when being discarded by Minyeong",

            "comment": "I was kicking my heels and giggling to myself all the way through today's episodes. One of my most common issues with romantic kdramas is that I don't see why the protagonists would even like each other or why I should root for them to get together, other than because they're the main characters and that's how the story is supposed to go. But in *Call It Love* both Woojoo and Dongjin are so distinctive, mutually complementary and likeable that you can totally see why each of them would fall for the other one.\n\nAnd they both had so many heart-stopping one-liners today: &gt;!WJ telling DJ not to like her, but then also telling him she'd fix his button again if she felt like it, DJ's choked out 'yes' when Sunwoo asked him if he was at least swayed by WJ (DJ really is a stubborn opponent if his best friend has to get him drunk to get a single honest word out of him, but the truth is obvious to us),!&lt; etc. etc. etc.\n\nThere were many great moments outside of their interactions as well, like for example &gt;!Jigoo being the one to hear Minyoung's self-pitying justifications at the door!&lt;, &gt;!WJ cleaning up MY's flat before leaving!&lt;, Joon's mother (I really liked her lol), etc. etc.\n\nThis drama is full of small moments where you can read the characters' facial expressions and supplement your understanding of what's going on with their unspoken reactions and my favourite such moment in this week's episodes came when &gt;!Jigoo was like, 'oh no, I'm never telling WJ I'm staying with you, I shudder to imagine her reaction!' and DJ could be seen kinda smirking into his food as if to say, 'yeah, she'd kill you.'!&lt; Kim Youngkwang's portrayal of DJ delivers a lot of these subtle cues.\n\nRe. Joon, I've been a firm proponent of the theory he doesn't like WJ but is simply overly invested in her life as her closest friend, &gt;!but the ending of episode 7 did make me wonder if I'm right a bit!&lt;... It doesn't matter, of course, &gt;!because we all know where his love life is headed. I have to say I'm very curious to see how he'll develop feelings for Hyeseong, though. Their banter is comfortable and funny, but Joon doesn't seem to respect her overmuch as a person or see her as a sexual being at all, so I wonder what situations the drama will put him in to flip his perspective on her so dramatically.!&lt;\n\nFinally, God, Minyoung, GO AWAY. &gt;!That back hug made me gag a little. DJ HAS to put her in her place next episode, I beg.!&lt; I think she could be a more interesting presence in the drama if she at least tried to put an end to her pathetic obsession with the ex she cheated on and got some self-respect, and I hope that's where her character is going to go in the second half.",

From what I\u2019ve been aware of so far, the classism, self image, and gender struggles are present just like any other country but Korea is still in a very conservative nature, thus taking a toll on the ppl there. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more to it that I didn\u2019t mention. \n\nNot to say drinking your problem away solves anything, cause it doesn\u2019t. It adds to your problems short term and long term depending on how you look at it, but drinking is a coping mechanism of choice.",

Even more so when they both have such a strong need and craving for affection and belonging that I could see it in their eyes. The way Dong Jin notices her in the office, the way she would do the craziest things just for his benefit. I\u2019m living for this one. \n\nI\u2019m really happy with the development of &gt;!Ji gu and Dong jin because I think he sees a bit of Woo Joo in him. Because of that it kinda makes him want to do things for Ji gu too. I\u2019m worried about the next episode because Ji gu will find out about his true identity and I wonder how he\u2019ll react, I hope the bromance won\u2019t be killed off because of this. !&lt;\n\nI also want to say that I\u2019m really glad that they avoided the whole cliche of the best friend falling for her. The entire time, Jun\u2019s behaviour can be misunderstood as so by Dong Jin but to the audience, it\u2019s quite clear that he just worries about what she\u2019ll do next. And now of course, he\u2019s worried about their potential relationship since he knows how they\u2019re connected.\n\nI also want to point out that there\u2019s something up with the &gt;!will. If there wasn\u2019t I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll mention it. I suspect that the will isn\u2019t real and Heeja faked it to give herself everything. Hearing all about how their dad used to treat them, it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019ll be that cruel. !&lt;\n\nLastly, I\u2019m also wondering what is the thing she wants &gt;!to tell Dong Jin. Initially I thought it must be her feelings but after the final scene, I\u2019m very sure it\u2019s not that. It could be that she told the manager that Dong Jin knows of his betrayal. Or that he\u2019s the son of the woman who her dad cheated on her mum with. !&lt;",

Loved those small details that add so much to the story. \n\nAside from DJ and WJ realizing their feelings for each other, I liked these moments:\n\nThat subtle eye squint of Dongjin when Woojoo was pulling away Jun. Is that jealousy, Mr. Han?\n\nWalking so so slowly to the office after their breakfast date, even though DH said they will be late for work \ud83d\ude09 Obvs they savor each other's presence.\n\nThose shots of them walking far apart, then slowly gets closer to each other \u2764\n\nWhile Dongjin still has that \"the weight of the world on my shoulder\" walk, it's not as bad as before. There's certain spring to his step! Oh and that run to the playground was \ud83d\udd25\n\nDJ and baby bro bonding\n\nWJ Pov while drunk - close-up of DJ! Had to rewind and rewatch. That whole scene was \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udd25\n\nThe way DJ and WJ stare at each other. Seriously WJ's gonna melt before Ep16 lol\n\nProd team is having fun w rule of thirds and aerial shots Lol! So so lovely and cinematic.\n\nIn another life, WJ and Minyoung could be besties lol. But Minyoung, pls move on. She's annoying but I also pity her.\n\nMinyoung's apt riddled w empty bottles remind me of Mr Gu's apartment. \n\nKudos to Sunwoo and baby brother for being main shippers and providing comedic timing! Finally co-CEO Sunwoo is useful lol. He's quite perceptive and knows DJ well.\n\nHopefully next Ep we find out more about that Will DJ's mom BF mentioned. Afraid that mom faked the will so she will get house; and Shim siblings Mom - is she dead or is still alive but sick? If she's still alive I guess she doesn't have the capacity to help and take care or her children anymore. Also reaction of Haesung and Jigu when they found out DJ's identity.\n\nCan't wait til next Ep.",

The original subtitle had her say something like \"Saying you are pathetic is no big deal\" which had impact. The new subtitle is something like \"I am just making an observation\" which really lessens the impact of that scene.",

Woo Joo\u2019s horror and Dong Jin\u2019s resignation is showed so well. \n\nThe playground scene was legitimately everything from the way &gt;!he rushed down to how he approached the situation. He didn\u2019t touch her or forcefully got her to do anything. Merely a suggestion and we can see how they\u2019ve sort of evolved from here because even though she told him not to, he still walked her home. !&lt;\n\nI\u2019m wondering to myself what I love about this show and I think it\u2019s all these little acts and glances of love. In Little Women, Greta Gerwig said she intentionally placed scenes like this with Laurie and Jo so the audience could be clued in to his feelings without him saying so and this is the same here. The way they did it is so natural and true to character so I really applaud the writers, director and the actors. They both are also, I believe, clued in to each other\u2019s feelings but both have been hurt in the past so they aren\u2019t able to decide whether they can go for it. And then for Woo Joo of course there\u2019s the whole situation with his mum. \n\nJi Gu being the person &gt;!who heard Min Young\u2019s confession was hilarious but I\u2019m also wondering why he didn\u2019t convey the whole message across. Those words from MY also probably clued him into Dong Jin\u2019s attitude towards his mother and I wonder if that\u2019ll change how Ji Gu views Dong Jin and his mum\u2019s relationship. I don\u2019t think Ji Gu realises that it\u2019s the woman who broke up his family yet actually. He was rather young when it happened and he never encountered her again but he\u2019ll realise it soon enough. Hopefully he does so after he knows how Dong Jin truly feels about his mum. !&lt;\n\nAbout director Shin. This is harassment! And I don\u2019t understand why MY doesn\u2019t just tell him the deal is off. Honestly in business if I don\u2019t hear back the natural thing to assume is that it\u2019s off but he is also desperate. I\u2019m not sure I feel anger or satisfaction towards the man to be honest. I just find it sad that he spent so much of his time wanting to take revenge when he can just move on with life and run his company well. Because of this, he is running it to the ground\u2026\n\nAnd of course, we now begin the torturous wait for the next 2 episodes.",

It\u2019s very alike Woojoo\u2019s character that she admits to liking him; she\u2019s so outspoken (surely DJ gets that right? She said something about her feelings in the conversation and then says don\u2019t like her. He\u2019s obviously confused, but which part is he confused about?) \n\n(Summer Strike spoilers ahead) &gt;!Recently Summer Strike did the ultimate move and both the leads who are shy introverts only held hands at the end of the drama as an implication of their \u201cconfession\u201d, and that was perfect for how they were. Ofc a whole bunch of people hated it but I loved it. It was enough and it was real!!! !&lt;\n\nAlso I wonder how far they will show our leads going.

This is the best one in a while and I am so happy to have started watching - even though I wish I came across it after most EPs have been released lol \n\nDo you have any recommendations of other slow burn dramas? For reference, here are some kdramas I watched and loved:\n\n-Nevertheless and loved it, I know people had mixed opinions but I liked it so much I rewatched it like three times. \n\n- One spring night and Something in the rain - same male lead and veeery similar energy imo, I liked that they were both pretty realistic. I am a massive Jung HaeIn fan so I liked pretty much every drama he starred in. \n\n\n- Starstruck in the city - the format was so different from everything I have seen so far, interesting, mature enough and generally a great watch \n\n-my second favourite of that year (2021) was a really unpopular drama Lost - a beautiful storyline about a woman so depressed she barely hangs on and a significantly younger guy who just happens to meet her \n\nI have been watching kdramas for like 10 years so I have seen most of the more popular ones by now - your typical slow burns like just between lovers, healer, descendants of the sun I have already gone through :)",

Finally, the double entendre of Woojoo's words about how the two of them were out of their minds - is this referring to the obvious case of drinking, or is she referring to Minyoung's breaking up with Dongjin and her own mistaken revenge plan?\n\nEither way, I find Minyoung a very believable character, whether she actually cheated after waiting five years for an uncommunicative guy to keep dragging things out without communicating, or whether she was coerced into staging it. Am very curious what she told Woojoo over darts/drinks, and why she changed her mind to flat out offer to move out when first she only agreed to moving out if Dongjin asked her to.",

I was only watching this one and crash course in romance. They have nothing to do with each other, but I really like them both. \n\nCall it love is, for the moment, when of the best dramas I've seen. The director is really good and the scenography is really well thought. We are on a slow burn drama but we feel so much even where there is so little given to us. I look forward to it every week. The main couple, the best friend and the family are really well played by the actors.\n\njust a little warning, if you don't like slow pace drama I think it will not be ideal for you to watch.",

Yet, on the other hand, I can't stop watching and I don't want to fast forward through sections because I don't want it to end too soon! \n\nI think I should have waited for all 16 episodes to complete before starting but now I am bitten by this slow but lethal bug.\n\nI love the ML but I also love the devoted best friend and I do not envy the FLs position. Also I love that she cares, truly cares for the best friend because she shows up and responds to him whenever he stretches out for her. Please don't make it romantic love. Let then be these best friends who are real solid rocks for each other. The ML cannot be that for her ever I think... it's not his personality. She needs the push back that her friend gives her and we all need people like him in our lives.\n\nI also love ML and brother's relationship. I am bored of the ex-girlfriend drama and can't wait for the story to focus on bringing the business back on track.",

It's more about responsibility, and both of them didn't take responsibility for their relationship \u2014 they just let it be.

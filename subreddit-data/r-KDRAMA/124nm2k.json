Not popular by any stretch of the imagination, Dae Yeol\u2019s only real joy comes from his time spent with the archery club. A talented archer whose skills have earned him a scholarship to the school, Dae Yeol doesn\u2019t mind being an outsider, so long as he\u2019s free to pursue his greatest passion. But an ill-timed run-in with a devilishly handsome classmate lands him in trouble and places his precious scholarship in jeopardy.  One of the school\u2019s most popular students, Jo Tae Hyun has always enjoyed a level of freedom that very few high school students have ever attained. Able to get away with practically anything, the entire school has no problem believing his side of the story when he\u2019s caught fooling around in the nurse\u2019s office with another student and Da  Yeol. Claiming  Da Yeol was trying to make out with him, Tae Hyun thoughtlessly puts the archer\u2019s scholarship at risk. Desperate to correct the misunderstanding, Da Yeol does everything he can to try to quell the rumours but no matter how hard he tries, it\u2019s just not enough.  Completely unremorseful about what he\u2019s done, Tae Hyun seems to take a  wicked sort of delight in doing everything he can to make Da Yeol\u2019s life favourite miserable;  his favorite method being to follow Da Yeol everywhere.  Unable to shake  Tae Hyun, Da Yeol spends his days loathing his shadow but the more time he spends with him, the more conflicted his feelings become; leaving him to wonder, where exactly does the line between hate and love end?

To think these two lonely, lost boys were living with additional heartbreak for 2 years - especially since they both knew where the other lived \ud83d\ude2d\n\nThe second leap was like a soothing balm (though I am having trouble believing these two hot blooded guys are still coy about kissing each other after 2 years of dating, and actually spent the night just talking \ud83d\ude10). High school love rarely lasts long, but theirs has endured and we leave them with the assurance that they will always be each other's shoulder to cry (and rely) on \ud83e\udd17",

I felt like the first time it forced Tae Hyun to come to grips with the fact that Da Yeol wouldn't allow him to manipulate him into forgiveness without change and acknowledge that he actually needed to change. And I liked that Da Yeol respected himself enough to draw the line and look for peace for himself. \n\nI think the lengthy break for me made if feel more like they were truly committed to each other and it wasn't just first love (but enduring). By the end I really felt like they were going to be together and overcome their problems and really fight to be happy. But 4 years is a long time to get to I like you. Worth it though.",

But at around 9 min into ep6 I ABSOLUTELY PANICKED AND PAUSED IT and was trying to look at spoilers from the leaked ep7 scenes but I could not be sure. So then an angel checked the ending for me and then I SOBBED once I knew (relief sob) and then I unpaused. And I sobbed AND SOBBED and eventually just smiled throughout \ud83d\ude0d",

One of my biggest issues was how Taehyun bullied DY in the beginning but episode 6 kind of addressed it in that despite that DY fell for him and acknowledges what he did, and I\u2019m fine with that. Reminds me of My Beautiful Man.\n\nI liked how the show had more than just romance and I don\u2019t mind the time skip or even the lack of a kiss. I do feel like episode 6 was a bit rushed and dramatic though, and could have done better with being spread out or having another episode.\n\nI loved So Yeong and want to see her in more things. I thought the acting was decent for rookie actors.\n\nOverall a pleasant show, probably in my top 10 Korean BLs for now. I hope Omega X finds success after this.",

I can already understand TaeHyun's reactions from the teaser since he said to his father \"I can't even love anyone anymore\". He'll probably try to put up walls, as he hasn't realized how important DaYeol is to him yet.\n\nI'm pretty sure this show will end up as one of my favorite KBLs (together with Our Dating Sim).",

Well played. \n\nThat was a roller coaster of the final 3 episodes glad I waited and did it all at once, and that they took mercy on us and posted the final episode instead of next week. \n\nFlowers for the actors as well in their first roles, very well done. \n\nI do wish someone had punched the friend though, he pissed me off too. \n\nManifesting an equally satisfying ending on Our Dating Sim.",

Like &gt;!two time skips!&lt; aghhh. &gt;!When Dayeol just ignored and rejected Taehyun when he was crying as Dayeol was switching schools?? What?? So sad. Like give Taehyun a chance to come to terms with his feelings, internalized homophobia, emotional damage from his family. It was unfair to expect him to be okay with the attempted kiss in the library and jump into a relationship. That was disappointing. Like give him a chance! And Dayeol leaving school was so out of the blue. And then straight to a two-year time skip noooo. It\u2019s like there\u2019s no resolution for any of the storyline from the first 5 episodes. And now Dayeol wants to be a police officer and archery is totally out of the picture? Followed by another two-year time skip. Why???? It felt like a totally different show. These characters could be anyone.!&lt; And the last episode, &gt;!they were acting more platonic than ever before. bruhhh. Very underwhelming ending. I miss our two high school students who were crushing on each other and each other\u2019s emotional support.!&lt; okay I have vented now. I really did enjoy the rest of this show.",

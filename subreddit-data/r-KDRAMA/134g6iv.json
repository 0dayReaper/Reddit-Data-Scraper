The drama tells the story of a woman who has to go into the swamp herself to rescue her drowning sister.\n\n- **Sparkling Watermelon**\n&gt;\"Sparkling Watermelon\" will tell the story of a boy living a double life between a model student and a band member who gets to time slip and meets his 18-year-old father. The two will build friendships there. \n\nMy wish is for the industry to keep rolling out these weird, food-related titled dramas!",

Despite this setback, he continues to pursue his passion for music and creates beautiful pieces by feeling the vibrations of the piano.\n\nOne day, Hae-sung meets a young woman named Kim Soo-ah (Jeon Mi-do), who has a unique ability to see sound as colors. Soo-ah is an aspiring painter who struggles to find inspiration for her art, but when she hears Hae-sung's music, she sees a kaleidoscope of colors and is captivated by his talent.\n\nAs Hae-sung and Soo-ah spend more time together, they begin to fall in love. However, their relationship is complicated by the fact that Hae-sung is deaf and Soo-ah sees the world differently from most people. They struggle to communicate with each other and face opposition from those around them who don't understand their connection.\n\nDespite the obstacles they face, Hae-sung and Soo-ah find solace in their shared love of music and art. With Hae-sung's guidance, Soo-ah learns to channel her unique perspective into her paintings and finds success as an artist. Meanwhile, Hae-sung's music reaches new heights as he draws inspiration from Soo-ah's vibrant world of colors.\n\nHowever, their happiness is short-lived when Hae-sung's hearing suddenly starts to return, leaving him confused and overwhelmed by the new sensations. As Hae-sung struggles to adapt to his changing world, he fears that he will lose the special bond he shares with Soo-ah.\n\nIn the end, Hae-sung and Soo-ah must navigate their way through their different perspectives and find a way to make their love work, despite the challenges they face. As they work together to create a masterpiece that combines their talents, they realize that their love is the most beautiful thing of all, and that it transcends the boundaries of sound and color.",

Instead, make the two kickass other female characters the romantic lead(s). Have Kim Sung Yeol (Lee Joon Gi) end up with his reborn wife, both roles played by Kim So Eun, and have Gwi (Lee Soo Hyuk) survive at the end and end up with the kisaeng madame (Jang Hee Jin) as end game and they just travel around the world in lots of sequels. I could honestly rewrite this entire script and it would be a joy to me.!&lt;\n* **Island**. &gt;!Make it more clear wtf is going on with the lore, and then make a sequel with the FL (Lee Da-hee) and Priest Johan (Cha Eun-woo) fighting demons around the globe.!&lt;\n* **Taxi Driver 2.** &gt;!take more care with the On Ha-jun (Shin Jae-ha) plot. Having the Bishop die rather than face any consequences for his actions other than death was just empty. Ha-jun deserved a better revenge.!&lt;\n* **Big Mouth.** &gt;!Change almost everything after the release from prison. The go-into-politics plot was terrible, as we've seen in countless other dramas that politics in dramaland ROK is just as dependent on who you know and how much money you have as anywhere else, and Park Chang-ho (Lee Jong-suk) had none of those things. They should have made him a broadcast journalist instead, imo.!&lt;\n* **The King: Eternal Monarch.** &gt;!Make the finale more clear! I like the ending and the setup for how their HEA will work, but the idea of Lee Gon (Lee Min-ho) waiting to find his version of Jeong Tae-eul (Kim Go-eun) could've been done soooo much better.!&lt;\n* **Alchemy of Souls.** &gt;!Delete the firebird plot entirely. The show is at its best when it's focused on the characters and their emotions and interactions; there was no reason to give it a big \"Game of Thrones\" type CGI finale because that was just dumb. They'd established that s2 ice stone Jang Uk (Lee Jae-wook) was pretty much invulnerable, so there were no stakes in the physical game. Keep the evil ice stone that Naksu (Go Yoon Jung/Jung So-min) has to retrieve, and make the plot more about who's evil and who isn't, and lean harder into different tropes.!&lt;\n* &gt;!I also demand that Seo Yul (Hwang Min-hyun) get a spinoff where he goes home to the life lantern North and gets to be the ML this time. Yul deserves it.!&lt;\n* **Flower Crew: Joseon Marriage Agency.** &gt;!Somebody give Ko Young-soo (Park Ji-hoon) all the hugs. His backstory and trauma deserved a lot more attention paid by his friends and he deserved some closure for his storyline. !&lt;\n\nI'll stop now.",

I was so devastated by the ending of that show that I was forced to turn to fanfiction for therapy. My goal was to investigate what Dong-Mae\u2019s lost years in Japan might have looked like - how did an orphan butcher from Korea end up not only trained as a samurai but leading a gang? I also wanted to further explore his obsession with Ae-shin. I ran out of steam before finishing but who knows, maybe I\u2019ll get back to it....

And the male lead  who is from jeju island is a nice wholesome man who never been in a relationship.\n\nAs they start dating in episode 6, she assumes he is a f boy but really he isnt and he is just smitten with her and he doesent truly realized it yet. Episode 12 is when things get complicated in a scene she yells about how much the new man is better and and uses him to brag to her ex best friend and her ex fiancee. The new man realizes this lashes out and basically Express how he is in love with her but she dont see it. At the end of episode 12 she realizes it and cries thinking she lost him...then in the last 5 minutes of the show when it's raining she get a suprise when her new man protects her from the rain.\n\nEpisode 13-15 she realizes her wrongs and fixes them not only does she help herself but she creates a healthy relationship with the new man and sees that he is an awesome guy ( and he really is) \n\nEpisode 16, her ex realizes her ex best friend is bad and now wants to come back.....realizing this she ignores his calls and lives happily ever after with the new man.",

Like a medical drama where a lead surgeon struggles with making time for his family,has a rival surgeon who's fighting for his position all while being concerned that the morgue/blood bank might be ran by a vampire.\n\nOr an enemy to lovers drama about two teachers who discover a hidden/horrible secret about the private school they work at. \n\nPolice officers in a small town where nothing ever happens deal with their first murder case. One thinks its the creepy old gardener while the other thinks an alien did it.\n\nI also want to see more big,manly dudes doing cute things and a college drama that won't bore me to tears.",

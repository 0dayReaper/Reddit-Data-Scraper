    "postText": "Grab yourself a knee rug and a mug of hot chocolate, it's time to reminisce those old time dramas from days gone by of pre-2019. Maybe you were  around when they aired for the first time and want to take a trip down  memory lane by watching them on the box. Maybe it's your first time  through.\n\nThis is our weekly discussion exclusively for those older Korean dramas on your currently watching list. We don't want to hear about the currently hyped dramas here, so please keep it to the older stuff on your watch list.\n\nReminder, **we advocate the use of legal streaming sources wherever possible**. Any comments mentioning illegal sources will be removed and links will lead to bans as per [our rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_linking_to_illegal_sources).  As it is very hard to find many of the really old dramas rather than  asking users \"where are you watching?\", we suggest you instead ask \"did  you find a legal source?\". See [our policies on streaming sites and VPNs here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/streaming_sites#wiki_vpns).\n\nCrazily enough not everyone has watched these classics yet so **please remember your spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;. For more detailed guidance on spoiler tags and when to use them, check our [Spoiler Tags Tutorial](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags).\n\n\n***Just In Case Resources***\n\n[FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and [Netflix FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101/netflix_faqs) **|** [Glossary](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions) **|** [Latest On-Airs](/r/KDRAMA/search?q=flair%3Aon-air&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=week) and [On-Air Roster](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episode_discussion_roster) **|** [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) **|** [Where To Watch *aka* Legal Sites](/r/kdrama/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas) **|** [Everything In Our Wiki *aka* Wiki Homepage](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/index) **|** [Get Recommendations For Your Next Watch](/r/kdramarecommends/comments/hl34w7/rules_resources_and_a_guide_to_navigating/)",

I think I watched it after it finished airing but I remember thinking it was a \u201cperfect\u201d drama. I loved FL, it was the first time I liked any of her roles. She made very rational decisions in it, and I liked how they both communicated their feelings. It was fresh, after all the usual kdrama miscommunications. Chang Wook was really nice in it too and I haven\u2019t seen any other drama where I liked him so much lol. And I loved FL\u2019s dad and their relationship. Ahh been a long time. :)",

It really takes a lot of courage to recognise that your dream position maybe isn\u2019t for you.\nAnd of course, that changing room kiss\u2026",

He isn't the most exciting or creative actor, but he definitely has star power, or the \"it factor.\" I feel compelled to watch him.\n\nAnd Kim Tae Ri is a goddess.",

The drama is going to ridiculous and unrealistic lengths to prolong it, and the suspension of disbelief is getting harder to maintain.\n\nYou know you are in trouble when the mystery-du-jour is starting to be more appealing that the OTP story.\n\nStill, the ML is adorable to watch if you like them wholesome but kinda dumb.",

I've been considering it for a while, but gave up on it because people had said it goes downhill towards the end. But some other things made me consider it again, so I started, and I do like it! Well, specifically, I like some things, and really dislike others.\n\n*Things I like*\n\n1. Definitely Lee Min Ho and his character, Choi Young. He's honourable, always chooses the right thing (as in, the correct, right-over-wrong thing), is competent, compassionate and kind, thoughtful, brave, is a good leader, and is very nice to look at.\n2. The going-back-in-time aspect. I love stories like this! Because, you know, I'd like to do that... (and of course, I'd do a much better job of it \ud83d\ude01)\n\n*Things I dislike*\n\n1. The 'heroine'. She's not a heroine; she's an annoying, selfish, oblivious character who does nothing heroic. I feel so frustrated and annoyed with her, all the time! Whining, not recognising the obvious facts about where she is and what's therefore required, and continually misunderstanding Choi Young - and making him feel bad about something he either hasn't actually done, or has to do and would rather not. She can't see his honour and courage and kindness, or even be very grateful for all the times he's helped and saved her, always at risk to himself, and the things he suffers as a result. She's older than him, but acts childish and shows the worst of what a modern woman might be like. She is an anti-heroine who is so vastly undeserving of Choi Young's love, which I know is supposed to happen, that it's a real failing of the story. And her hair! It's continually smooth, coloured, and curled with a curling iron. Because she found one of those in 1390-whatever, and does her hair each morning in this modern way. Even when she's camping out and has been riding a horse all day or sleeping in a hut.\n2. There's a lot of cheese. For example, the villain's costumes are silly and disconcerting as a result. His character or acting is also overdone.\n\nDespite the cons, I like the pros enough that I can say I like this series.",

            "comment": "I've finished episode 36 (of 40) of **Should We Kiss First?** This drama is not an easy watch. It deals with rather difficult themes, and the main female lead has been through a great tragedy that has all but ruined her life. I also think that this might be a drama where translations are inadequate to fully understand what's going on. There seems to be a lot of subtext. But I am enjoying the drama. It's a love story, a redemption story, a healing story. I like that it's a love story between more mature leads. And I find the OST haunting.

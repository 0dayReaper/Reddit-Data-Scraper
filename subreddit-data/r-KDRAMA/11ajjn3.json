I feel like the story and the acting would be more entartaining in that format because this way, even though Kim Jung Hyun is an outstanding actor, it's hard to fully appreciate just how good he is in this series and how serious his skills truly are. His way of speaking, long monologues, body language - he changes them constantly to play multiple characters at once. \n\nBtw, all the actors are great, but they would truly shine on stage with a story and directing like this. I've had quite a few laughs watching it but I understand it might not be everyone's cup of tea.",

Don't get me wrong, I'm still enjoying it enough to continue watching (mainly because KJH's acting keeps it entertaining) but it feels like the plot hasn't really gone anywhere or made use of the concepts that made the show sound intriguing in the first place.\n\nThey've got this whole-ass deity with anger issues whose job it is to carry out (justified) murders under God's orders and the show decided it was a good idea to stop him from doing it when it was literally the best aspect of the plot! They've also got the past-life plot that they've barely made use of, I was expecting more flashbacks of the couple's backstory during the Joseon era, how they met, the moment their forbidden love affair began, and how the other characters like Yi-Deun were involved (we saw a brief flashback of his past Joseon-era self with the couple), etc. Since the plot is mostly comedy the Joseon-era parts would've been the perfect place to amp up the tears and drama to switch things up a bit.\n\nI guess I'm just getting bored of the constant bickering and misunderstandings, I was hoping by now she would've finally discovered the truth about his identity so that he can at least start openly using magic around her or whatever, it all feels too mundane.",

This is not like Heavenly Idol, where the deity might be able to assume the role of a pop singer (I'm enjoying that too), Kokdu would have centuries of medical knowledge to catch up on!",

She's a doctor, yet why did the writers kind of made her an oblivious/one-dimensional character? I guess this is the way they elongate the story. No hate for the actress, it's just the story made me not like her character. I liked the actress' role in Graceful Family!\n\n I'm sorry, I'm only watching this solely for kokdu and his henchman and henchwoman ;-; they kept me going tbh. I usually finish my dramas without skipping.",

            "comment": "**Episode 9 and 10**\n\nListen I\u2019m convinced this whole show is like a 16 episode audition that KJH is giving for every kind of role ever! He\u2019s so freakin\u2019 good at bringing so much to the table whether it\u2019s exaggerated expressions, micro expressions, charm, humour, romance, tone, dialogue delivery, restraint, cold blooded ness. He is really doing it all and giving it his all. \n\nI really hope he gets picked up for more and better roles. Totally deserving. Hoping also Mr. Queen\u2019s arrival on Netflix in the west will help boost his popularity internationally. \n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure what\u2019s happening with the plot but it now seems to have simplified down to: &gt;!he\u2019s getting his comeuppance for past actions as Kokdu, embroiled in some politics murdery mess as DJW, too blind to see or anticipate the earthly repercussions for his actions in DJW\u2019s body, living on a timer and wanting desperately to live out his fantasy of a happy life!&lt;. \n\nI actually really really loved the individual scenes that HGJ and Kokdu had with Ok Shin and Ok Vin. Those were very very moving. \n\nI\u2019m also loving the fact that we\u2019re getting more of the brother and honestly it was pretty cool that he struggled with the decision but ultimately decided to &gt;!do his job and protect his sister!&lt;. It would\u2019ve felt a bit misplaced if twice he chose to &gt;!protect his prospective love interest than his sister or pursuit for truth/justice!&lt;.  \n\nNot entirely sure why HGJ has hid the fact that her brother is a copy from Kokdu but I suppose shock factor for next week!\n\nI\u2019m still enjoying the show albeit in large part to the actors carrying it rather than the storyline.",

Han Cheol hates Do Jin Woo and therefore Kokdu because he thinks DJW's the one behind all the murders when it was all Kokdu doing his grim reaper duties, Gye Jeol and Jung Won dislike each other because of their past but Jung Won is showing interest in Gye Jeol's brother, and today we find out that the guy who tried to murder Gye Jeol and set up a spy cam in her office is &gt;!Jung Won's father.!&lt;",

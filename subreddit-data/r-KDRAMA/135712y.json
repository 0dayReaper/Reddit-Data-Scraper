So both are probably a result of similar cultural/media zeitgeist.\n\nBut the concept of a post-apocalytic delivery service dates much further back. *The Postman* (1997) has the same basic premise, and it was based on the 1985 novel by David Brin.",

I just hope they surprise me with something. Under the generic premise there's something to see...",

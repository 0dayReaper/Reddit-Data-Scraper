Ngl, I low-key stalked the Netflix team on LinkedIn a couple months back because I wanted to work at The Swoon, but that was when I found out that most of their staff isn't even technically in Netflix. \n\nThere's another agency that manages Swoon stuff (SNS posts, creating videos with the actors, etc) so I feel like Netflix decided to outsource stuff to them, but now that Netflix stocks are faltering (and they're also laying off a bunch of other teams too), they didn't keep the team.",

A couple of our peeps moved in house at Netflix. Then of course they laid people off. Totally anecdotal, but common to outsource certain things first with high volume tech companies, then move execution in house.\n\nI\u2019ll also say from a google search visibility standpoint that generic name is probably better than The Swoon.",

And they are not necessarily particularly smart, it is just that most murders are easier to find because people kill friends and family, or there are witnesses. Now with DNA technology it is probably much easier to find the rare murderer who kills a stranger. I am sure it is not only in Norway that old cases have been solved recently. \n\nI don't tolerate suspense well, but in addition I mostly dislike crime in fiction because it pretends to be realistic while it is nothing like. \n\nAnd I agree completely that it is overdone in combination with romance. It is as if the writers don't trust in their ability to write suspense about other things, it sort of has to be \"the biggest thing\". \n\nI am anyway soon going to start the drama that I think was your inspiration to write this comment, and am looking forward to it.",

I really like the secondary couple, but I'm having trouble rooting for the main leads because of the age difference &amp; power imbalance. Like when I was a teenager I thought Buffy x Angel were hot and a romantic couple but now that I'm older... I have a different perspective. I'm trying to convince myself to imagine the FL as a 23 year old, graduating college and applying for grad school instead of a 19 year old graduating high school...

I am watching **Once upon a small town** right now and I'm really loving the maturity in dialogues especially from SL as well as ML.Tension is introduced through other people but it's not dragged on for too long and yeah I'm really liking this sort of mature but no less swoony relationships in k-dramas.

This was first  time he did the killings (appeared on the screen) after getting bawl out. Even hhe didn't dare to kill Taesok directly after that jerk threatened him many times. Just felt sad that Jungpal hasn't learnt his lesson yet from Mr. Cha and I didn't think he would survive further even tough he got all  the money from the rucksacks. Sanggu on the other hand, was too obsessed with Phillip when he  already had Mr. Cha's assurance to be his heir. Mr. Cha's casino empire in Philippines definitely  came to an end after that internal rife.",

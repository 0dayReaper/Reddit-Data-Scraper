When he stopped being annoying for me and started acting good towards her. I was afraid that it would lead to unhealthy relationship, but it turned out to be fine!\n\nAnd my two favourite characters were secretary Young and Park You sik. First one was illustration for Knight in shining armour (on that scene in forest I couldn't decide, should I laugh or applause). Second one is absolutely comic relief, especially his relationship with secretary (she was soooo troublemaker!). And I just love these actors",

Any users who are displaying negative conduct (including but not limited to bullying, harassment, or personal attacks) will be given a warning, repeated behaviour will lead to increasing exclusions from our community. Any extreme cases of misconduct (such as racism or hate speech) will result in an immediate permanent ban from our community and a report to Reddit admin. Additionally, mentions of down-voting, unpopular opinions, and the use of profanity may see your comments locked or removed without notice.\n* **Spoiler Tag Reminder:** Be mindful of others who may not have yet seen this drama, and use spoiler tags when discussing key plot developments or other important information. You can create a spoiler tag by writing &gt; ! this spoiler ! &lt; without the spaces in between to get &gt;!this spoiler!&lt;. For more information about when and how to use spoiler tags see our [Spoiler Tag Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags). **Please be reminded that spoiler tags must be used when discussing the original webtoon/web novel in consideration for those who haven\u2019t read it.**\n* **DISCUSSION FORMAT (Individual Episode Comments):** Please discuss details and spoilers for each individual episode under the designated episode comment, while keeping in mind to use spoiler tags as necessary. This will hopefully help streamline discussion and allow users to avoid episode-specific spoilers as they scroll through. Direct links to each episode comment will be pinned at the top and comments will be sorted by old for easier access to them. General comments about the show can be commented as individual comment threads with the usual spoiler tag guidelines in place.",

Within these discussion threads, you **must not include any discussion or spoilers** for episodes after the episode in question. Spoiler tags should be used for major plot spoilers within the episode. Individual episode discussion threads may be accessed through the links in this comment to prevent users seeing whole series spoilers. To participate in these threads reply to the comment \"Episode ...\" or another user's comment. Please report any comments that spoil later episodes using the custom report \"user has spoiled a later episode\" rather than the general \"unhidden spoiler\" report.\n\n**Whole series discussion:** General discussion of the series may be made as a direct reply to the post or a reply to another user's comment outside of the individual discussion threads. Please use spoiler tags for any spoilers within these comments.\n\n---\n\nPlease be reminded that spoiler tags must be used when discussing the original webtoon/web novel in consideration for those who haven\u2019t read it. e.g. (webtoon) &gt;!spoiler about webtoon!&lt; (drama) &gt;!spoiler about drama!&lt;.\n\n---\n\n**Moratorium**\n\nWe will be implementing a moratorium on posts about **Black Knight** in accordance with our [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_recently_aired_dramas) on recently aired dramas.\n\nThe moratorium will be implemented as follows:\n\n**Current Discussion Thread**\n\nThis discussion thread will serve as the On-Air discussion thread for the series for two weeks (12 May - 26 May, 2023) during which all posts about **Black Knight**, except for eligible Designated Day submissions, will be redirected to this thread. If this post exceeds 1000 comments by the 26th of May a wrap up discussion will be made, if not all discussions of the drama will be directed here for an additional two weeks until the 9th of June, 2023.\n\nEligible Designated Day submissions are exempt from the moratorium.\n\n**Reviews**\n\nReviews of the series that fulfil our [moderation guidelines for reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies#wiki_moderation_guidelines_for_reviews) will be allowed as self posts from the 26th of May, 2023.\n\n---\n\n**Links to episode threads:**\n\n* [Episode 1](/r/KDRAMA/comments/13ey8qf/comment/jjs787y/)\n\n* [Episode 2](/r/KDRAMA/comments/13ey8qf/comment/jjs791i/)\n\n* [Episode 3](/r/KDRAMA/comments/13ey8qf/comment/jjs79vd/)\n\n* [Episode 4](/r/KDRAMA/comments/13ey8qf/comment/jjs7aol/)\n\n* [Episode 5](/r/KDRAMA/comments/13ey8qf/comment/jjs7bfw/)\n\n* [Episode 6](/r/KDRAMA/comments/13ey8qf/comment/jjs7c95/)",

I was expecting 5-8 to be a bit more ruthless, so that was different when he let them live. But all the quick cuts seemed so out of place--they had the perfect costume for stuntmen with the jackets, cap, and mask so they could wear all the protective gear and fight all out. Instead, we got a bunch of quick cuts that made it seem they ran out of budget. That one scene looked like a cheap TV show because of the edits, the rest of the episode looked awesome.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Chairman Jang! I like him as a crazy old coot.

Not caught by camera? How did the major know gramps?), and personal opinion but the major's acting is seriously so bad and really pales in comparison to the boy's during the grieving scene. Lastly so many cringy scenes like how 5-8 knocked out a big-sized man with a punch........ Bruh they r supposed to be protectors of precious scarce resources from armed hunters, this is not the way to try to emphasise 5-8's strength man....",

I thought the acting, design, cinematography were all great and I was entertained, but I did not think the series as a whole was great like Squid Game or The Glory. For me, the character development for both 5-8 and Pres. Ryu was missing.  I was fine with engaging with \"mutant boy\" and his whole acquired family both the refugees and the major. There was no motivation for the evil guy that the refugees had to be eliminated. There was clearly room for them at the end and he just kept ordering to kill hundreds of people for no reason apart from possibly being a psychopath. He was a very flat character. I wanted more background and complexity. It felt like he was the root of all evil and once eliminated everything was perfect \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I wish human societies really worked like that.\n\nKim Woo Bin was great and perfect for the role. He bulked up so much to express all the power and protective menace of 5-8. He kept me watching, but I really wanted his background. They only showed us his survival story, but he must have come from somewhere, developed his skills, had human connections.\n\nThere were a few things I found distracting. I have to admit that every time Woo Bin pulled out a cigarette, I cringed: Did they really make him smoke after his cancer?!? I know it's fake and he's an actor and everything, but k-dramas are often so particular about not showing someone actually smoke. And I wanted to pop everyone's blackheads \ud83d\ude02\n\nPS edit: The director said in an interview that Woo Bin smoking was all CGI because of course he refused to smoke, but smoking was such a defining characteristic of 5-8 in the comic that they still had to put it in.",

That's what the bit in episode 5 with the delivery-people measuring the pollutants from the truck was about. So as soon as Ryu Seok was gone and they stopped intentionally polluting things got clearer.\n\nI agree it should have been longer, a lot of the reveals felt underused/underdeveloped. The whole mutant thing, the disease Seok was dealing with, the fact that Grandpa was friends with the Seok's father and helped design the air core, whether 5-8 was mutant and that's why he was so strong, the intentional pollution thing, the whole plan about the new special district and why they wanted to keep the refugees out so bad.

However, the character of the main villain is underdeveloped.

The action sequences have a visceral quality that packs a punch. Special mention must go to Episodes 3 &amp; 4, which are dedicated to the &gt;!Deliveryman Recruitment tournament!&lt;, which feels like a mash-up of influences ranging from the *Fast &amp; Furious*, *Mad Max*, *Squid Game*, and even a little *Physical: 100*, with a post-apocalyptic twist thrown in.

The fact that what made people underestimate Sawol and have her district attacked more often was because she was a girl, as well as the only girl among the deliverymen. Yet we had none of that in the kdrama, as far as I remember, the only time we have a deliveryman fighting refugees is on the opening of the episode. Sad to see that Sawol's motive was changed as well, but ig they might've not wanted to go down the \"supernatural\" genre :/",

    "postText": "Hotel Del Luna: a short review of one of the best dramas I have watched\n\nI just finished watching Hotel Del Luna for the first time and I can tell I am going to be thinking/obsessed about it for a while. I don\u2019t often find dramas to be *flawless* but I think HDL is definitely top 5 for me.\n- Jang Man Wol: This is my second Hong sisters drama after Alchemy of Souls, and I am sensing a delightful pattern. Jang Man Wol is everything a classic k drama female lead is not. She is irascible, materialistic, abrasive, and on the surface, quite malicious. In fact, the whole focus of her story is &gt;!her rage driven revenge that she wants to exact from Cheongmyeong!&lt; so much so that &gt;!she has been cursed to remain in \u2018purgatory\u2019 for 1300 years!&lt;. And yet, there is a hidden tenderness, a biting sense of humor, and an unfailing sense of justice in her actions that is hard to escape. I seldom see such well written characters in media and I am grateful for Jang Man Wol.\n- Koo Chan Sung: He\u2019s the perfect foil to Man Wol, in how he starts off righteous and upright, but starts to display his playful, \u2018dongsaeng\u2019 side with her. At the same time, I see him being her inner voice. He is often pushing her past her nihilistic ways, to do what she would have done if she weren\u2019t burdened by her own past. Even though &gt;!he is her junior in life experience by literally hundreds of years!&lt;, he has an old soul type nature. &gt;!I wasn\u2019t surprised to see the part where they both had met as children, in Chan Sung\u2019s past life, and Man Wol\u2019s current, but it is one of maybe 3 or 4 instances where a childhood connection made sense and was executed well!&lt;. I do wish &gt;!his mother\u2019s storyline!&lt; was better explained, but I think it wouldn\u2019t have added much to the drama overall.\n- HDL has some of the most interesting secondary characters, the employees at Del Luna had wonderfully rich backstories and amazing camaraderie. I particularly enjoyed Mago and &gt;!her various forms!&lt;. I am interested to hear any thoughts people have on what &gt;!they each represent!&lt; or if there is any mythology that Mago is supposed to reference.\n- The theme of the drama, a guesthouse for the dead, a place for souls to rest before going onto the next stage, is so comforting to me. The small vignettes we got for various souls, a little glimpse into a life that offered such depth of emotion, wasn\u2019t always a clean or perfect resolution, but usually ended with the soul departing with some semblance of peace really brought me bittersweet solace. I have cried nearly every episode of this drama, and I am now tearing up thinking about some of those stories: &gt;!room number 13 guest\u2019s story!&lt; was most painful and so reflective of how &gt;!SA victims are treated in our world it broke my heart!&lt;; &gt;!the father and son whose last act was to call the truck driver to ask for forgiveness, just wrecked me!&lt;.\n- Finally!! HDL brought me to actress IU, and I cannot express how much I enjoyed her performance. The sometimes over the top dramatics were well balanced with heart stopping emotionally heavy scenes. To me, no one else could have played Jang Man Wol. IU carried off each outfit with so much grace and sassy attitude, I cannot. Even during impossibly sad scenes &gt;!particularly when she\u2019s departing and is walking on the bridge, we get one last glimpse of her turning back, and basically thumbing her nose at what she\u2019s been told about the afterlife. This is my interpretation, that she\u2019s suddenly hit by the realization that it\u2019s not as scary or lonely as she anticipated, that she (potentially) still has her memories of Chan Sung indelibly etched in her soul, and that she would find her way back to him.!&lt;\n- for me, this drama has a &gt;!happy ending. I do think it was a reincarnation we are seeing, because we see each of the employees as well, and they don\u2019t seem to remember each other, but ManSung have found their way to each other in the next life as they promised they would!&lt;\n\nI have a lot more to say about this drama which I might continue to add in comments or (hopefully) in conversation with other HDL lovers.",

In Hotel Del Luna IU was great and I thought her outfits were fun and interesting, so it was very entertaining to watch, it was a nice story.\n\nMy Mister is a much harsher story, but IU's acting it is just fantastic! It's borderline unbelievable how well she does in that.",

But in My Mister, &gt;!the struggle is much more drawn out, it hurts to watch both the interior and exterior struggle of the character and as they grow and change.!&lt; Her acting was just so good-I really became quite a fan.",

I cried every ep, finished it in a week in early Feb, and since then have finished 3 more dramas to try to fill up this VOID but it\u2019s impossible.  \n\nI started this for Yeo Jin Goo after finishing Beyond Evil and came out of it just obsessed with IU. I really wish they\u2019d star in more dramas together... I kind of get where some of the other commenters are coming from about the romance, but their chemistry was so good to me it made sense that Koo Chan Sung was drawn to Jang Man Wol.\n\nI looked up old posts on the show from this subreddit and blogs after I was done and it seems quite a lot of people were upset by the ending. To me, it was perfect. Jang Man Wol staying back in this time and world would\u2019ve negated her character arc and undermined the lessons she learned together with Koo Chan Sung. And while I was heartbroken to see them be separated, I felt at peace knowing they would be re-incarnated and find each other in every lifetime. Chef\u2019s Kiss.",

This hindered the romantic experience for me as Goo Chanseong for some unknown reason is interested in getting to know Man Wol and Hotel Del Luna. You can stretch this to the destiny aspect but I still feel like it felt awfully forced and the romantic development could have been a lot more natural.\n\nOne thing awesome about this drama is how they love each other equally but Man Wol loves Chanseong in a flawed way. I love how she saves him and he saves her. \n\nAnyways that\u2019s it for the romance part. In terms of cinematography, the drama is aesthetically beautiful and the supernatural cases that kinda function as arcs made it interesting to learn more about the world. I love how grim the kdrama was and some of the themes it covered. The chemistry between the cast was also fantastic and each character was so likeable that it made this drama all the more heartbreaking.",

I kind of felt they had a more best friends or soulmates vibe without the romantic aspect we attach to soulmates often. It made sense to me why Man Wol was drawn to Chan Sung, but Chan Sung being drawn to her made less sense. Unless we count &gt;!Mago placing the flowers on his heart and that bringing about not only him wanting to stay and work at Del Luna but also being drawn to Man Wol!&lt;.

I even convinced some friends to watch it and they liked it too. I would probably suggest this anyone who is interested in dipping their toes into the kdrama genre. \n\nI started my mister but then switched to mr.

I love that this centered around the FL, IU, probably the only thing I love here. She's an awesome character, filled with rage and regret, and maybe she will go on over a thousand of years more if the ML didn't appear at all, but I don't want her to need him. \n\nPerhaps, I want her to help herself deal with her past alone, doing everything on her own however how long that takes. It's fucked that she didn't get to know the truth about the past not until it is all too late. She LOVED him \u2014 her past, that's why she can't get over with it and it's not just because she's mad. We've known her character, she's someone who loves more than hate. She LOVES them to death so why did it get to that?   Personally, i think they ruin her by giving her that man. He's cool but not just for her. His character distinguished that rage within her that it almost felt forced and rush. She needs a push, but I don't think it should be another man. \n\nI still love HDL tho.",

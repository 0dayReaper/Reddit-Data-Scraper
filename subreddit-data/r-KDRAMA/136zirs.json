    "postText": "I'd like to apologise in advance this review may a bit long, also these are just my thoughts and how I interpreted the show as a viewer\n\nI'll start with the characters \n\nJoo Dan Tae:\n\nHe has to be one of my favourite villains in general, my favourite kdrama villain ever.\n He has everything that I could ask from in a villain, a tragic backstory that gives context to but doesn't excuse his horrible actions, extreme intelligence so it makes sense why it's so hard to beat him, charisma when he chooses it, a loyal morally grey henchman.\n\nAnother thing that that I love about Joo Dan Tae is how consistently evil he is, whenever he is faced with two options he will always choose the more evil option even if it slightly inconveniences him, he has committed the entire spectrum of crimes from fraud, embezzlement, bribing, harassment,child and spouse  abuse, murder, attempted murder and identity theft etc he doesn't discriminate.\n\nHe is also extremely petty, the scene where he waits in the hallway for Bae Ro Na behind a plant just so he can pop out and verbally bully and  intimidate her then she pepper sprays him  made me laugh so hard, there is no greater purpose to this scene so it's my head cannon that he did it because he was bored and just didn't like Bae Ro Na.\n\nThe actor did a brilliant job, and I can't imagine anyone else pulling off all Joo Dan Tae's different moods like this, I love him as a character but I'm terrified of him as a person, to an extent where I lowkey get tense when I watch his interviews, It's like Joo Dan Tae pretending to be an actor \n\nHe is my favourite character so I give him a character ranking of 1/14 in the drama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheon Seo Jin:\nI'll start by praising the actress that portrayed her , she is so talented. The way she plays Cheon Seo jin is just so fascinating to watch, it's like every facial expression that Seo jin makes  is  carefully constructed and molded from unbreakable glass , from happiness to anger to sadness everything on her face is exactly  where it needs to be.\nIt doesn't feel unnatural because Seo Jin is exactly the kind of person that would practice facial expressions in the mirror to look perfect and socially appropriate at all times\n\nThe moments where she extremely distressed and this facade breaks just a little are my favourite moments to watch ( the moments when her father falls down the stairs, when she reacts to  Ha Eu Byeol trying to kill herself) \n\nAs a character idk how I feel about Cheon Seo jin she is evil yeah but not evil to where it gets funny like Joo Dan Tae, She is intelligent yeah but her jealousy and pettiness often override her better judgement which I guess is entertaining because it makes her different from the primary villain, I did find some of her character desicions annoying as they sometimes come out of nowhere ( etc suddenly being in love with Ha Yoon Chul in sn2 after everything that happened in sn1)\nThe reason why she is this high up is because I  loved watching her mainly because of the actress, Penthouse wouldn't be the same without her.\n\nCharacter ranking  2/14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShim Su Ryeon:\n\nI don't know exactly how I feel about this character, the actor was brilliant, she is so unapologetically feminine and elegant I love that about her, but she is so nice and righteous up to a point where it becomes a flaw. She sometimes feels more like a device to move the plot forward than a character because of how unrealistic,  almost godlike she is, regardless I love watching her, the show gets good whenever she comes around and the scenes where she beats up Joo Dan Tae give me life\n\nCharacter ranking 3/15\n\n\n\nJoo Seok Kyung: \nI love Seok Kyung so much, I might be biased because I find her so attractive especially after she changed her style in season 2 ( she never shows interests in anyone so my headcannon is that she is maybe gay) \nAlso because as a character she is the one that feels the most real/relatable to me, she did a lot of horrible things but I imagine it hard to be a well adjusted child when you actively living in a physically abusive household with Joo Dan Tae.\n\nI don't think she is inherently evil, she had twisted reasons at to why she did a lot of the things that she did, she bullied Min Seol A more because she felt threatened and was insecure about her intelligence, she was nice to Bae Ro Na up until the point where she begins to feel threatened by her.\n Of course that doesn't mean she is a nice person  and she know that which is why  I think she struggles with a lot of self-hate, It made sense when she started to support her father in sn3, she simultaneously hated and craved the approval of an abuser which happens too often in real life which is why it's hard for people to leave \n\nI also like how self-aware she is, she isn't book smart and acknowledges that openly which is refreshing after I watch Ha Eun Byeol be in constant denial about her lack of skills, she kind of know her lane\n\nI loved her ending so much, I literally couldn't stop crying at just seeing her be a well- adjusted adult, it was only during her parts that I was just bawling, I'm tearing up now writing this, I guess her story hit so hard because of how real and relatable she feels\n\nThe actor was also amazing \n\nCharacter rank 4/14\n\n\n\n\n \nYoo Jenny:\n\nShe is the character that I think develops the most, the reason why I love her so much is because of her relationship with Bae Ro Na, I love female friendships so much, so you could imagine the other time that I couldn't stop crying was when she gave Bae Ro Na food at the end of sn1\n\nThe way I interpret her and Ro Na's relationship is that she disliked her originally because of how similar they were in addition to Bae Ro Na being a better singer than she was. It's only at the end of sn1 and beginning of sn1 when Bae Ro Na is at her lowest that she let go of her jealousy and sees her as a person and takes care of her,\n\nCharacter ranking 5/14\n\n\n\n\nBae Ro Na:\nI love Bae Ro Na as a person but she annoyed me so much as a character in the overall Penthouse story so much, It was only in season 3 that I started to feel fondly towards her. She expected too much from her mother and made a lot of stupid decisions when it came to confronting Cheon Seo Jin, you could always count on Bae Ro Na to pick the most awful times and places to pick fights with rich people  it's no surprise that she was sued, the first time that it happened it was okay but it happened so often in sn1 that I got so annoyed and that annoyance transferred over to how I felt about Bae Ro Na\n\nHer character otherwise was okay, she was nice but not to a fault and didn't go out her way to be unnecessarily mean ( except toward her mother) \nShe was the most \"normal\" character. My favourite part about her was her relationship with Yoo Jenny\n\nCharacter ranking 6/14\n\n\n\nHa Eun Byeol:\n\nI wanted to hate her, I really did but I just couldn't the poor girl looked like she was on the verge of  a mental breakdown 90 percent of the time that she was on screen,I couldn't help but think ,'get her to therapy asap' everytime they I saw her \n\nI can't imagine how it must be to not be the very best and have perfectionist Cheon Seo Jin as a mother and absentee Ha Yoon Cheol as a father ( he did try to help her but not hard enough considering how bad it got before he noticed, he seemed to be doing the bare minimum as a father,  he was more caught up in how unhappy he was than his daughter most of the time, she felt like an after thought)\n\nI loved Eun Byeol's ending it was so nice to see her so happy\n\nCharacter ranking 7/14\n\n\nOh Yoon Hee:\n\nI found her so annoying in the beginning for the same reason I found Bae Ro Na annoying, she didn't know how and when to pick fights and it got grating after a while, I remember not being the slightest bit surprised when she kissed Joo Dan Tae and after the reveal that she killed Seol A, I found her annoying as a person and a charecter in   the story \n\nI started to like her a bit after sn2 but that was more because I discovered that the actress that played her was Eugene from kpop group S.E.S and I listened to a bunch of her solo songs which I loved so whenever Yoon Hee got too annoying I'd kind of dissociate and sing \"Cha Cha\" \n\nShe is still this high up because she is important to the plot and also objectively she wasn't that bad, she was more morally grey than evil but I couldn't help it, idk if I'm the only one, does anyone else feel like this? If you like her please comment why maybe I'll be able to see her in a different light\n\nCharacter ranking 8/14\n\n\n\n\n\nLee Kyu Jin:\n\n\nI love him so much,the actor is a  phenomenal comedy actor, he acts so shameless, immature and  greedy to such an extreme that  it's brilliant, ( no shade to Vincenzo but he pulls of brilliantly what I feel the side characters in Vincenzo where trying to do) perfect comic relief \nto break up tension\n\n it's just so fun to see him on screen, the only reason why he is this low is because he isn't as important to the plot and since he is mainly there for comic relief his plotline isn't as grounded, I don't have complain though I would change a thing about the actor or Lee Kyu Jin\n\nCharacter ranking 9/15\n\n\n\nKang Ma ri:\n\nShe is probably the most morally grey character, she is an opportunist to the very end, she was on Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin's side even though she knew about all the awful things that they had done, she ended up on the right side in the end and ended up being the owner of the new Penthouse \n\nOther than that I don't have much to say she is good mother, even if I wasn't particularly fond of her I felt okay about her\n\n\nCharacter ranking  10/14\n\n\n\n\nMin Seol A:\n\nI like Min Seol A but she isn't really a character as much as she was a plot device to trigger the events of the show, she was literally the stereotype of \" poor orphan, don't you just feel sorry for them\"\nShe is the character on this list that gets the least screen time, the reason why she isn't at the bottom is because she was innovative enough to scam her way  into  a job, the little screen time that  she does have develops her and makes her a better character than those lower\n\nCharacter ranking 11/14\n\n\nJoo Seok Hoon:\n\nI can't really call him a plot device because the plot isn't dependent on him, he is just there most of the time, we don't get much information about the nuances of  his thoughts and feelings on most things, we just get a surface level look at his thoughts\n\nEven his relationship with Bae Ro Na is surface level, they don't have a particularly interesting dynamic, it's like a one note relationship \n\nCharacter ranking 12/14\n\n\nLogan Lee: \n\nAnother plot device character used to drive the plot forward, I liked him best in sn1 when he was pretending to be that country pumpkin teacher \n\nThe reason why is so low is because of what he did to Min Seol A, I know he feels bad about it but considering he was an adult and Seol A was a child I can't forgive that easily\n\n13/14\n\n\nHa Yoon Chul:\n\nI didn't like him as a character in the story and as a person, I explained why in Eun Byeols part, he was an awful dad, he was also just horrible to Yoon Hee\n\nThe reason whyI dislike him so much is because of how sorry he feels  for himself, he keeps doing awful things and feels sorry for himself like that makes it okay, it's just so hypocritical and annoying to see, his character also wasn't that necessary for the plot, Penthouse would still have been Penthouse without him \n\n\n14/14\n\n\n\nMy overall thoughts \n\nThis drama was a wild ride it's the perfect combination between a Telenovela and a kdrama.\n\nI liked s2 more than sn1.\nbecause it was my first Makjang I only properly enjoyed the show after sn1 was over when  I digested the fact that the purpose of the show is to make me feel as stressed  as possible, I started to enjoy it and even see the sometimes dark humour, also after sn1, all  the characters that remained where all evil/annoying some level so it was less stressful to watch evil vs annoying than evil vs good \n\nSeason 3 was my least favourite not because it was objectively bad but because the shows format started to feel a bit repetitive, the final episode does make it worth it \n\n\nThe camera work/cinematography is amazing and it's the first drama that I've watched that doesn't have an ost, it's all classical singing and orchestra's which I really think contribute to the overall vibe of the show \n\nI also like that the show is  self - aware, there is a lot of dark humour and over the top humor \nThe show doesn't take it's too seriously which works in it's favour\n\nWhile the drama is plot twist driven it does seem like the writers knew the story that they wanted to tell  from the beginning ( In sn1 ep1 Min Seol A and Seok Kyung are wearing the same cardigan and there was such a weird emphasis on that that it stuck in my mind and I now theorize that it was foreshadowing that they were twins) \n\n\nOne major complaint that I have is the ridiculous amount of plot holes that the drama has and the fact that the drama would make characters make out of character decisions that make no sense just to move the plot forward:\n\n (  Oh Yoon Hee wanting desperately for Bae Ro Na to go to Cheong Ah arts even though she knows very well that Seo Jin hates her and her daughter and will make her entire high school experience awful, there are other high schools.\n\nThe way Shim Su Ryeon treats Joo Seok Kyung in the first half of season 3, it just makes no sense\n\nEverything Ha Yoon Chul did\n\netc)\n\nAnother complaint is that the characters in the show are like  vampires, everyone keeps coming back to life,  they do this so often that I lowkey wouldn't have been surprised if Min Seol A waltzed in alive and well mid sn3 , it kind of takes the impact that a death is supposed to have away because at the  back of your mind you know that the writers may just decide to reverse this death whenever they feel like it\n\nIt doesn't take that much out of the drama tbh, because everything else is so good I'm willing to forgive the necessary evils, there are dramas out there that have a tighter stories and way less plotholes but they don't have that special over the top ridiculousness that makes Penthouse so fun to watch\n\nOverall this was a fun and simultaneousley frustrating drama, I would highly recommend it not to everyone though I think it takes a certain type of person to enjoy  a makjang this frustrating those that will like will love it, It's now my 3rd favourite drama after \" It's okay to not be okay\" and \"My mister\" \n\nOverall rating I give it a 9/10",

Originally there wasn't meant to be a season three but season two got cut short and they decided to do a third season instead.\n\nAnyway, I liked the first two seasons a lot, and agree with many of your observations abuot the characters. Some great scenes and memorable interactions made this a must-watch.\n\nMy personal favourite is probably Kyu-jin and his ridiculous dog-shaped bag (complete with blurred-out head in the international version).",

Much much more convincing as villians than the psychopathic mother in IOTNBO. They had this innate drive to step on others and enforce control in every affair. Shim Su Ryeon was so good at retaliating against them albeit reluctantly and she's so unique and memorable in her role as an anti-hero \ud83d\ude0d",

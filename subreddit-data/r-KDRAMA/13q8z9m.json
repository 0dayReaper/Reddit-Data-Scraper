And the floating plastic bag in ep 1 feels like a reference to American Beauty.\n\nEp 2 - is it normal in korea for students to have their teachers' phone numbers? And to call them on the weekend? Loved this ep as it explored her role and influence as a teacher. Should she be encouraging their dreams or making sure her students achieve success in by capitalist standards? And what is the value of art/who decides? Also was the song she sang at the end a song that already exists? \n\nEp 3 - omg i havent heard this erik satie song in years. The piano music in the bookstore. The cafe/resto she hangs out at after has such a stunning ocean view. Does anyone know what it's called (if it is indeed visitable rather than just a private location they rented out for the shoot)? I love how awkward and sweet the side-by-side walking in the subway scene was. Omg who buys someone mandarins and then runs away \ud83d\ude02 so cute. His face looks so familiar to me. I def saw him in EAW but i feel like he looks like someone else... I recently also used a hairdryer to dry wet clothes while travelling \ud83d\ude02 so relatable. Ugh folks this is why you pick an exact meeting location or exchange contact info! \n\nEp 4- wow sokcho looks nice. Maybe i should add it to my list. Lmao the elderly man ending their argument with \"you're too tall for your own good\" \ud83d\ude02 the food in lieu of apology was so on brand. \n\nLooking fwd to the next set of eps!",

If you go, you need to visit the seaside Naksan temple and Shinheunga temple at Seorak mountain! Being there was like traveling back in time. Definitely one of the most memorable parts of my time in Korea :)",

I can understand why you might think it sounds similar based on the synopsis, but if you watch the trailer for **One Day Off**, it should be apparent that the two have very little in common. The Japanese series is a semi-reality based food show, whereas food is only a small element in this small town, slice-of-life Korean drama set in the 90s.",

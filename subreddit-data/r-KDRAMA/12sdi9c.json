    "postText": "Grab yourself a knee rug and a mug of hot chocolate, it's time to reminisce those old time dramas from days gone by of pre-2019. Maybe you were  around when they aired for the first time and want to take a trip down  memory lane by watching them on the box. Maybe it's your first time  through.\n\nThis is our weekly discussion exclusively for those older Korean dramas on your currently watching list. We don't want to hear about the currently hyped dramas here, so please keep it to the older stuff on your watch list.\n\nReminder, **we advocate the use of legal streaming sources wherever possible**. Any comments mentioning illegal sources will be removed and links will lead to bans as per [our rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_linking_to_illegal_sources).  As it is very hard to find many of the really old dramas rather than  asking users \"where are you watching?\", we suggest you instead ask \"did  you find a legal source?\". See [our policies on streaming sites and VPNs here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/streaming_sites#wiki_vpns).\n\nCrazily enough not everyone has watched these classics yet so **please remember your spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

This one ticked off all the requirements that I had. Right now I have only seen 2 episodes of it. But its enough for me to see that this drama will be great. I did had to get used to the two black bars either side of my screen. I like the acting of Lee Joon Gi. He is so young in this!!!",

It\u2019s a time travel story where a Joseon man who wants to restore Queen In-Hyun travels forward in time and meets up with the actress who is playing her in a sageuk drama being filmed. It\u2019s a sweet romance without the super annoying miscommunication plot devices. \n\nI\u2019m on episode 15 of **Coffee Prince** and agree it\u2019s an overall great drama that\u2019s held up well. The main thing that strikes me as an odd note is seeing Gong Yoo play another seemingly asexual character. In both this drama and Goblin, his character has more sexual chemistry with the male characters rather than the FL, and that includes the FL in Coffee Prince before he finds out that she is female. Side note, I watched Coffee Prince, then happened to watch kmovie **Bad Police** with a decade-older Lee Sun-kyun; he\u2019s again fantastic in it.\n\nFWIW, Boys Over Flowers is only worth watching for Lee Min-ho\u2019s hairstyle and getting bad SML syndrome.",

The only thing that keeps it from being a 10/10 for me is the 2FL, who ruins so many scenes with her histrionics. I\u2019m not sure why the 2nd leads, and especially her, have to be so over the top when no one else really is. \n\nI saw the IU\u2019s Palette she did with Gong Yoo where he says because of some of his roles, he has a reputation for being a sensitive, romantic guy who\u2019s a good listener (paraphrasing), but that in real life he\u2019s not romantic or even particularly nice.",

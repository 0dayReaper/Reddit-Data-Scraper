It\u2019s a western quasi-reality show with 8 episodes by the producers of The Office - it\u2019s sharp and funny but surprisingly has a lot of heart. The main guy is a GEM - he will restore your faith in humanity. And James Marsden is in it and he is hilarious! There is one episode that has a few minutes that are definitely not safe to watch with little kids/your parents and there\u2019s swearing - but otherwise mostly PG-13. The  episodes are only 30 min so it\u2019s low risk! Highly recommend",

The story and the romance were great and there were so many funny moments. The cast is incredible! As for the drama with the BEST 1st episode, I'm convinced WYWS secured that spot \ud83e\udd47 I already miss the rookie, and very clumsy, prosecutor (ML) who is constantly panicking and doubting himself, but still able to solve his cases while helping all involved parties. I would LOVE a spin-off show with the SML (Jung Hae In).",

            "comment": "Without getting too personal and depressing, my dad passed away a few months ago and two dramas kept coming up on my watch list and without reading the descriptions I decided to watch. Both helped me with processing grief and my emotions in a way I wasn't expecting and didn't know I needed.\n\n1st was **Summer Strike** I am very introverted and often do not speak my mind like the FL. My job really doesn't mean that much to me anymore or the things that I thought were important to me I guess aren't. I am also about to embark on a journey of self discovery. I am quitting my job and going on an eat, pray, love type trip and hoping to find myself just like the FL &gt;!Just without the murder part lol!&lt; This drama was really underrated. Loved the sweet moments between the FL and ML. A recommended watch.\n\n2nd was **Move to Heaven.** I cannot stress enough how absolutely beautiful this show was. Here I was thinking it was just about a boy and his Uncle helping out those who passed but it was so much more. I cried probably every episode. I felt every emotion Geu Ru had about his dad. Maybe because I am also feeling this way and not ready to let my dad go. I felt so protective over Geu Ru watching this drama.  This is my first drama with Lee Je-Hoon and was I missing out. What a man.\n\nThank you for letting me share my emotions I'm now on 10 out of 16 of **Taxi Driver**. What a ride this show is.",

After watching it, what hit me is that people often tend to remember the most (or feel regret about) the short period of time just before the person's death. However, that is unfair toward the deceased who shared a lifetime of memories with people. Besides, they are so much more than just the way that they passed away.\n\nWish you luck on your journey of self-discovery. \ud83d\ude42",

It was good and interesting in the beginning but a few episodes in it became such a snore fest, lol. Up untill episode 12, I think. Somewhere around that time &gt;!the old king finally died and the ridiculous plot lines (oh my god someone served him crab it's treason!) died with him!&lt;. Really glad I persevered, the last few episodes were worth it. &gt;!Their short-lived happiness was so sweet, and then the king remembering it all in the last episode... *cue sobs* I also went to google them, apparently she had two miscarriages before having the boy who was the crown prince, and then a daughter who only lived a few days. It's so sad that after all none of their children lived \ud83d\ude14!&lt; Damn, my eyes still hurt \ud83d\ude14",

Episode 3 focused in painstaking detail on Kang-ho's physical and emotional rehabilitation, and most importantly, on the long journey of reconciliation in the mother-son relationship. Episode 4 was lighter in tone, and kicked off with a heartwarming montage of happier days in Kang-ho and Mi-joo's relationship, followed by some quirky and comedic interactions between Kang-ho and the villagers.\n\n**Beyond Evil** (12/16): Watching two Shim Na-yeon dramas in tandem makes for top-notch viewing. The twists and turns show no sign of letting up on the home straight. Choi Sung-eun's performance as Manyang butcher Jae-yi is perhaps my favorite from among a host of outstanding performances.",

They have such an interesting premise to their relationship, and to see how it changed over time, especially in this episode, was pretty neat. I like the depth it created. It was also cool to see pre-accident Kang-ho as a somewhat more likeable and personable character at some time, especially since Mi-joo is a total opposite in terms of temperament. And I really like these two actors a lot.",

Both episodes made me cry, and that's a sign of a good drama for me. I love crying. If the drama continues to be this good, it might be in my top 10 list. We'll see how it goes.\n* **She Was Pretty (10/16)** \u2014 This drama is growing on me. I may not love it, but it's pretty cute. ML is more tolerable now, and update on my second lead syndrome, it's still there. I love the 2ML a lot, and I feel heartbreak for him.\n* **Joseon Attorney: A Morality (12/16)** \u2014 This week was frustrating. The interactions between ML and FL disappointed me. On top of that, not much happened. Even the end of episode 12 wasn't much of a cliffhanger like last week. I do enjoy watching Woo Do Hwan's acting (which is amazing, as always), but that's not enough for me to latch on to. I need revenge, and I need it fast.\n* **Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha (8/16)** \u2014 I love the interactions between ML and 2ML. They're so fun together. I look forward to watching more episodes.\n\nAlso watched an episode of **Come and Hug Me**, making me halfway through. I may not be into it, but it has some good elements. I love angst, and this has it.",

            "comment": "Been a while since I posted, so lots of updates.\n\nCurrently Watching Kdramas: \n\n* **Tale of the Nine Tailed 1938** - first episode was fun and king of Looney Tunes-esque in tone. Loved the part where &gt;!present Lee Yeon had to steal the sword from past Lee Yeon!!&lt; Looking forward to the rest of this series. \n* **Extraordinary Attorney Woo** - started this because it kept coming up on Netflix, and so many of you loved it. I gotta say, I can understand the hype, even after one episode!\n* **The Eighth Sense** - waited until it ended to watch, and it is very, very hard to keep myself from binging. Last night, I had to talk myself out of watching another episode because I knew if I did, I would watch another one after that, and I have to sleep sometime. The tension is exquisite, the acting and writing are amazing, and I love the Korean surf rock.\n* **Because This is My First Life** - a little over halfway through and really enjoying it. It's not too angsty, not too simple, just well written and easy to watch.\n\nCurrently Watching Other:\n\n* **Love Village** - got sucked into yet another Japanese reality dating show. This one has \"older\" people (35-60 years old) living in a house and trying to find love. Much less drama than with younger dating shows so far, but still plenty to enjoy.\n* **Naked Dining** - this one has turned out surprisingly heartfelt, along with the humor of the ML getting caught naked/undressing by the love Interest over and over again. And the idea of travel through cooking makes me want to cook my way around the world, too.\n* **Our Dining Table** - such a slow, sweet burn. I love that it's as much about finding yourself/finding your people as it is about the romance. I've noticed that Japanese dramas do this so well.\n* **A Boss and a Babe** - Cuteness and fluff and open communication. It's my happy show each week.\n\nCompleted:\n\n* **Strong Woman Do Bong Soon** - the kidnapper plot went on way too long and wrapped up way too neatly, but I loved the main couple.\n* **Love To Hate You** - started strong, then the writing got a little bit sloppy. It felt like there were scenes missing, and they were telling instead of showing. But I loved the FL and her dynamic with the ML, especially that he accepted her for who she was.\n* **I Will Be Your Bloom** - started strong, then turned into one \"very special episode\" after another. The romance was so tame it was basically nonexistent.\n* **Hometown Cha Cha Cha** - it was fine. Still not a fan of the ML, but he did get better in the second half.\n* **Animals** - really good. Well written, and the romances were realistic. Sort of had a RAIBB vibe to it.\n* **The Night I Became an Animal** - anthology series, so some episodes were definitely better than others. Each episode has an NC scene, and, again, some were definitely better than others.\n* **Bed Friend** - started with a bang, ended with a fizzle. I'll watch Middleman's Love, but I'm not crazy excited about it.\n\nDropped:\n* **Happy Merry Ending** - too many characters, the plot was all over the place and overstuffed, and I couldn't remember what happened from episode to episode.",

I like all the actors, even the baddies, from previous shows, and I appreciate the humor and small town intrusive neighbor tropes, even when they are hamming it up. It starts out on such a bizarre dark turn, and that is CONSTANTLY underlying the show, but then it has this heartwarming stuff, occasional small town goofiness, etc. I like it, and I'm really interested to see how it goes.\n\nI've started watching **One Spring Night**, 3 eps in. I like this one a lot. I like both of the leads, and it's pretty interesting on how they have a lot of chemistry, so much so that there are scenes where they are literally standing across huge rooms or streets and yet the energy feels like they are right in each other's faces.\n\nI also picked up on **Dr. Cha** a little late. I'm through Ep 6 as of last night. Netflix recommended it to me EVERY time I opened the browser, and I was all \"Don't tell me what to do!\" and then I checked it out anyway. Really like it. I also like that while you can kind of tell where it's going, occasionally a character does something chaotic or unexpected in a moment that makes the show pop.",

But I have to say the final 5 eps or so did such a good job building to the climax, I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Of course I loved the way it was shot and the acting by all of the cast members was superb. The music really grabbed me towards the end and contributed to the rising tension.\n\nOne caution. This is possibly the most violent drama I've seen. I believe it was ep 20 where the violence began its fierce escalation and I had to watch a couple of eps of Indian Matchmaker before I could go to sleep. If this kind of thing bothers you, stay away. Not unexpected, and realistic considering the times, but can be hard to watch when it keeps coming at you relentlessly.\n\nOverall, I consider this a masterpiece.  My acting discovery in this was Byun Yo-Han. I only knew him from Misaeng and I thought he was fantastic in this. Also Kim Min-Jung, Jo Woo Jin, and Kim Byung-Chul with whom I was completely unfamiliar. But everyone was so so good.",

The whole time I just wish they'd put the lead couple into a happy drama full of fluff and love. I thought Mr Sunshine was sad. This is straight up misery and pain. Even the finale I was hoping would be a bit more light hearted but Jesus. I need to rewatch Hometown Cha Cha Cha after this or something. \n\nStill, this is one of the best dramas I've ever watched but not at all light-hearted. The tragic scenes were so shocking I think it made me overlook some weak plot points but I'd say that's a good thing to me. \n\nThe acting for the lead couple was award worthy. Reporter was funny and much needed in such a dark drama. Villains were diabolical and I hated everything about them. Excellent writing. \n\nI just started **The Glory** on ep 2, but can anyone tell me if it's like Flower of Evil? I need to prepare myself for tragedy.",

Really recommended! It's about the political/campaign staff that works behind the scenes in the lead up to an election.

But I\u2019ve actually enjoyed it. It was a fairly slow slice of life / romance but I kind of liked the realistic storyline and the pacing was actually kind of relaxing.

But there are a few good ones which provide a nice contrast to the K-drama style, and show off the best elements of a Chinese perspective on life/drama. I'm liking this series, too.\n\nIf it was your first, and you liked it, you might also appreciate *Meet Yourself*. Other standouts are *Reset* (fast-paced and *not* relaxing), and *Love Between Fairy and Devil* (intense and also not relaxing, but beautiful and truly excellent).",

Korean drama series have more profound insight and nuanced story/character development, and although they have a lot of 'tropes', they're also somehow less predictable. I find there's a lot more sugary stuff in Chinese dramas - juxtaposed with some very disturbing or violent things, strangely. \n\nSo the ones that stand out, really stand out.\n\nOf course, it's a taste thing, and I guess reflects the culture of both these places as well. I prefer the Korean style, but many like the Chinese approach.",

The characters, like all of them, are amazing. I absolutely love this drama so far. The FL\u2019s family is awesome. I had been saving this for awhile so I\u2019m happy to dive in now. \n\nThe Good Bad Mother (5/14) \u2014 I will watch Lee Do Hyun in anything, any time, any where. His acting in this is fantastic! Story has some issues\u2026but those might workout later in the drama. Shall see. \n\nThe Real Has Come (14/50) - typical makjang weekend family drama about a contract marriage. I don't normally watch these but I really am still enjoying this one. I am actually watching it without subs and then rewatching with subs once Viki adds them. I have a very very long way to being fluent in Korean but for the most part I can gather what a conversation is about so nice way to test myself. The pacing is good. Characters are something else. All and all it\u2019s a fun makjang so far.\n\nHappy Merry Ending (5/8) \u2014 BL \u2014 Story pacing is odd. Characters are cute, it\u2019s fluffy, but it\u2019s a filler show and likely mostly forgettable.\n\nLove Mate (2/8) \u2014 BL \u2014 Absolutely hilarious! The characters are nuts. This is one of the funniest dramas of any type or style I have seen in a long time. I can\u2019t wait for the new episodes to drop tonight. \n\nMy Perfect Stranger (4/16) \u2014 This drama is fascinating! I love the premise so far. Basically 2 people end up time traveling to 1987, think they have nothing to do with one another (but totally do) and have to figure out how to stop a murderer. So far I am very much enjoying this one.\n\nMy 20th Twenty (6/12) \u2014 the story for this could have been done better. And the FL is supposed to be the same age as me, which is interesting to watch. It\u2019s a nice filler but not sold on it. The acting is terrible. \n\nBlack Knight \u2014 Tomorrow it drops! So excited!\n\nNon-Korean:\r\n\nA Boss and a Babe (10/12) \u2014 Thailand BL \u2014 they are adorable! Still fluffy, though definitely have had some serious moments, but all together a fluffy drama. Still enjoying it.\n\nOur Dining Table (5/10) \u2014 Japan BL \u2014 It\u2019s cute! The main leads are great actors that I can not get enough of. And the food leaves me hungry every time! This week is going to be pivotal and I can not wait! I already can tell I am going to rewatch this often as the acting and micro-expressions are just too good.\n\nNaked Dining (4/12) \u2014 Japan BL \u2014 Angst and food. So much food. Leaves me hungry. The two mains are doing a really good job too! \n\nThe Love You Give Me (22/28) \u2014 China \u2014 OMG! The leads and storytelling in this! It\u2019s basically a contract marriage, but also not, and a enemies to lovers, but also not, and they already have a kid together, who is adorable! So much misinformation and miscommunication! Very frustrating on that note, but the story is fantastic. It finishes next week (on Viki)\n\nCompleted:\n\nOn a Starry Night \u2014 Japan \u2014 a 35 year old female gynecologist meets a 25 year old male end of life organizer/photographer who is Deaf. She learns sign language to date him. This is an amazing drama. Utterly amazing. Characters are fantastic. So many stereotypes broken. And seeing the Deaf representation was so good, even if the actor isn\u2019t Deaf. I\u2019m Hard of Hearing so part of the Deaf community (but only adjacent and off to the side) so watching another cultural interpretation of it is interesting to say the least. I can\u2019t recommend this one enough!",

However, I get tired of seeing the same formula over and over. Most are:\n\nSet in the royal palace\n\nThe top advisor to the king is usually plotting with the queen or queen dowager to kill the crown prince.\n\nPeople being tortured to confess \n\nAdd your own here.\n\nThe Nokdu Flower is different. It centers around a revolution in the latev1800s and 99% of the story takes place outside the palace grounds. It truly has an all star cast and the scenery and filmography are top notch. The drama was very much historically accurate and the fictional parts were riveting, emotional, really drew me in. I probably cried ten times, especially during the latter half of the series. I would love to hear recommendations for more dramas like this one.",

That's one of those where I still remember how it felt to see various scenes and moments, and I feel like I keep searching for moments like that in other dramas. There's a moment in Episode 12 (I think) which is maybe my 3rd favorite scene in all of kdrama. First is the Spring Sunshine scene in Extraordinary Attorney Woo, and second is the last couple of minutes of episode 2 of Bad and Crazy. \n\nIt's Okay is also the master of the romantic stare down filler shot.

I want to recommend it to everyone *but* a central story arc to the drama is its FL dealing with the ramifications of her sexual assault and some of the scenes and dialogue is very triggering. My favorite aspect of the drama though is definitely the writing, especially the characterizations. The moral grey-ness of all the characters and the way their selfishness (and on occasion, selflessness) manifests and entangles their relationships has been a captivating watch. I personally have a bad habit of 'rooting' for antagonists on occasion because sometimes their characters are written with more depth but in QoM, I don't have to worry because all the main characters are antagonists to someone so I have no qualms rooting for someone 'bad'.\n\nAlso rewatching **The King of Dramas** piecemeal to balance out QoM but mostly using variety shows instead.\n\nDid recently binge **The Eighth Sense** and it was really solid as a drama with plenty of chemistry and a clear story that felt sensible. Loved the friendships portrayed in it *a lot*!",

            "comment": "Finished **The Package** which was a relaxing watch. Made me want to travel ugh. I love shows like this with a diverse ensemble cast and slowly delves into each character\u2019s back stories.\n\nFinished **One Dollar Lawyer** which had a strong start, Namgoong Min and Kim Ji Eun in their best comedic elements but the 12 episode somehow ruined the pacing since it suddenly went solemn in eps 7-8 then had to wrap up so less of the comedic fun at the start. I will say it was so reminiscent of all those typical quirky heroes against big bad corruption that I kept thinking I\u2019d seen it before when I was watching the first few eps (think drama marriage of Again My Life, Lawless Lawyer and Chief Kim).\n\nWatching **Into the Ring** which I\u2019m finding very ok and not that engaged with surprisingly. I started for PSH after being impressed by him in The Glory. He\u2019s doing fine, Nana is also ok but I think it\u2019s the story that I\u2019m kinda finding ok. I like the premise but not quite the execution, I don\u2019t know why.\n\n**Memorist** is the other drama I\u2019m watching to balance out ITR. It\u2019s decent but the characters are also not really compelling. In that, they\u2019re there but I don\u2019t quite feel much for them yet. The story is decent though as a thriller. Can be a bit creepy and makes me feel like religion and cults are quite a big problem in Korea having seen it depicted in dramas as such.\n\nPicked **Flower Crew Marriage Agency** back up because I found it watchable and not too heavy last time. Enjoying it quite a bit. No need to think or focus too hard which is nice.",

Enjoying the clues, and the little precious moments - like the lovely blossoming trees they were walking under to the picnic this week. \n\n*Secret Guesthouse* (8/16) - it's getting better. Clearer who is who, and things are moving along. They still all have too much makeup, though. \n\n*Great Doctor* (20/24) - I put this episode off a bit, because I was worried it would be tragic; but it turned out better than had been foreshadowed! Phew. Maybe things will turn out, although I'm not sure how they could. I wish they'd cast actors for Chae Yong and the doctor who were closer in age. I think the age gap - 10 years, with her older - makes it too hard for them to imitate real connection. The only thing that works is the arguing banter.",

Loved the first two seasons, the first half of season 3 was over the top (even for penthouse) and dragging but it definitely has picked up now. Excited to see how this will end and also happy that I\u2018m finally finishing this monster of a Kdrama. Every episode has a run time of almost 1 hour and 20 minutes so it was like watching a move every episode even though most of them were incredibly fast paced.\nAfter I finish this I\u2018m thinking of rewatching Vincenzo again or starting with Hospital Playlist.",

They will pay anything to have that become their reality. And, there are other people willing to try to make that happen no matter what they have to do. And they do some truly horrible things. The horrible things they do may be why this series is not more noticed. It is a complicated tail that begins with innocent children in a desperate situation who do whatever they can to get out of that situation.

But I\u2019m enjoying this one even with the interminable wait each week.\n\nAgain My Life - 13/16 - this has been a bit of a slow watch for me with all of the politics but \ud83d\ude05 LJG is very entertaining and his character\u2019s crew is interesting so the watch continues. I definitely liked Lawless Lawyer more.\n\nMy Shy Boss - 4/16 - clicked on this bc it\u2019s on my Netflix watchlist and it\u2019s flagged bc it\u2019s leaving at the end of the month. It\u2019s not a masterpiece but I got hooked enough that I need to know what the trauma is so I stayed up way too late binging and still haven\u2019t gotten far enough to any major reveals.\n\nRecently finished:\n\n100 Days My Prince - did have to fast forward a little in some of the king agonizing over his decisions parts, but did cry when &gt;! the brother died, even though I really disliked him for most of the show !&lt; \n\nLove to Hate You - this was a slow rewatch with my oldest teen who happened to catch a couple of episodes with me one night and then decided he wanted to watch the whole thing after I had already finished it. Still made me laugh out loud just like the first watch.\n\nMad for Each Other - I didn\u2019t expect to like this as much as I did! It was much more realistic than a lot of other dramas I\u2019ve seen. I also liked the shorter episode lengths.",

I think years of being a massive Buffy fan made me immune to the cheesy, inconsistently executed storylines in this one, but wow this drama is a mess. But I love it anyway. The best part of the drama is the beautiful costumes the vampires wear, especially Gwi.\n\nAlso, for some odd reason, LJG has a really puffy face for most of the drama. Apparently he broke his nose filming one of the early action scenes.\n\nLawless Lawyer 7/16 - basic revenge drama, a little predictable. It's nice to see the FL from It's Ok Not to be Okay in a role where she's likeable.\n\nThe Glory - 2/8 same author as Goblin, did not expect the bullying scene to be so graphic and awful. My hope is that the romance with the Baduk player will help this woman calm down a bit.\n\nTale of the Nine Tailed 1938 - 2/12\nBananas plot and antics as always, but I'm here for the Lee brothers bromance.",

While I can partly understand the ML's rough behavior, betrayals and all, the FL keeps on having zero depth and no clue, running around doing nothing if not actively messing things up. As much as the acting is top notch from both WDH and Bona, writing is killing this slowly, and the standard useless SML love interest doesn't help. Wrong direction, need to get back on track.\n\nHeard good things about the **Deborah** drama and as much as I hate the ML I also love In Na so I might give it a shot, with a couple new ones coming in the next month or so.",

It focuses on the victims(the families, the people left behind) and not on the perpetrators which I found refreshing. I feel like too many shows these days focus on the murderers and why and how they did it to the point where it seems like they're glorifying them(it's why you have Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy fangirls/boys). I like how Beyond evil doesn't give the perpetrator that kind of attention. I just really like the message of the show. Especially how it shines light on missing persons cases and like i wrote before, the families and even the surroundings that are affected by various crimes, and how much such incidents linger even long after the criminals have been caught. It felt like it had real heart in that manner.",

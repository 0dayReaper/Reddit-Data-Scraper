Just thinking about it makes me want to watch again even though I watched part 1 twice and when part 2 aired, I watched each episode 3 times because I was that invested! (On Saturday morning we would watch the new episode and then again at night. Sunday we did the same. And then watched both before the new ones came out the next weekend. That\u2019s how invested we were.  I\u2019ve never done anything like that with any other drama).  Great world building and character building.\n\nI also really liked both Taxi driver seasons and I love Lee Je hoon. But nowhere near as much as AoS. I hope you watch!",

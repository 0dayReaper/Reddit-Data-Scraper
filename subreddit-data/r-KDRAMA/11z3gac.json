            "comment": "**Age of Youth (Season 1)**\n\n* **Good Things**: The five brave young roommates of Belle Epoque sharehouse are just trying to find their way in life. Whether it be working part-time jobs to make ends meet while balancing this with their college studies, or trying to navigate the highs and lows of romance and relationships, it's all immensely relatable. The more introspective yet fiercely loyal roommates like Jin-myung (Han Ye-ri) and Eun-jae (Park Hye-soo) are two of my all-time favorite drama characters. The mellow acoustic soundtrack complements the drama to perfection.\n* **Bad Things**: Being a 2016 drama, it falls into that period where some problematic on-screen behavior was tolerated. \n* **Interesting Things**: It's a coming of age tale, with slice-of-life moments, in a college setting, which represent three of my favorite genres separately. The fact that it combines all three makes it almost too perfect for me as a viewer.\n* **Spotlight On Because**: One of the best depictions of friendship I've seen in a drama.",

            "comment": "Divorce Attorney Shin\n\nCurrently airing and while not hugely popular on this sub, those of us watching it are generally enjoying it. \n\n\nGood things:\n\nThe three lifelong friends - ML lawyer, his paralegal and a realtor have the best friendship group and are completely believable. They are hilarious and moving together, regardless of whether they're singing trot karaoke in the apartment, ordering crabs from home shopping network or carefully stalking each other in times of emotional distress. The chemistry they have together is amazing, the three ramyeon losers have won me over completely. \nThe plot is moving along nicely, cases are getting resolved in realistic rather than idealistic ways. The side characters fit well into this world. \n\n\nBad things:\n\nNot much yet, the drama is halfway done and the story is moving along nicely. There is a darker aspect to the story with ML sister's in laws family, but I will withhold judgement until it has played out. \n\n\n\nInteresting things:\n\nI mentioned in one of the on-air discussion threads that I found this drama to have a familiar vibe to Run On and this turns out to have been directed by one of the same people (also has a repeat cast member who so far is good in both). Side by side, I would never think to compare these dramas, but they do both have a subtle, quietly intelligent vibe. \n\n\n\nSpotlight on because:\n\nWhile the friendship is not the main plot point, it brings so much to this drama and is exceptionally well done. It doesn't feel like we're watching a group of great actors; it feels like we're getting a glimpse into real relationships.",

I found out about them while I was scouring yt for csw's videos.\n\nNice review, but for bad things, I would say that the divorce cases can get controversial as they are mostly focused from a flawed person's perspective. It's surprising how a lot of people got offended by this drama over mdl and reddit when in truth, real lawyers were consulted while writing the cases.",

It's interesting seeing so many musical theatre actors getting and crushing great tv roles lately.\n\n\nAs for the cases and the divorcees being controversial, I think it's more realistic; humans are flawed. I'd much rather see two not-perfect people fighting over a difficult situation than convenient resolution each time.\n\n\nI'm curious if you have some other legal dramas you recommend?",

            "comment": "Hi everyone. It's been a while since I posted but today I have a wonderful recommendation: [Marriage, Not Dating ](https://mydramalist.com/9803-marriage-not-dating)\n\n**The Good:** This is a Rom-com but it's essentially 2 friend groups that become one friend group and couples. \n\nGong Gi tae (ML) doesn't want to get married and who can blame him. His parents' marriage is a mess and he doesn't believe he can find happiness with someone. \n\nJoo Jang Mi is the opposite. She wants to get married and receive the affection she didn't get from her parents growing up. They were always busy working and often left her alone. \n\nGong Gi tae get blackmailed by his mother and grandmother to get married but to resolve this he asks his best friend's ex (Jang Mi) to pose as his girlfriend because of a misunderstanding.\n\nSo in the beginning the relationships are a bit messy with Jang Mi jumping between friends but they were faking in the beginning so it wasn't that bothersome. But it being messy was how the friendship started. The two leads had their problems and their friends jumped in to help them. \n\nThe friendship bonds were so strong in this drama because the leads were doing the most and they supported them till the end. Sometimes during the show I wished that they would be the voice of reason instead of accomplices but they were birds of the same feathers.\n\n**The Bad:** I would have preferred if they didn't have the ex turned into friends mess and the messy dating history but it's not that big a thing in the show tbh. \n\n**The Interesting:** This was the first kdrama that I watched and it still holds up today as one of the best rom-coms I've watched. The friendship theme is very strong and I believe it won't disappoint new viewers. \n\nI have to admit I am a bit biased with drama as it introduced me to the rabbit hole and it holds a special spot. But I'm certain that this show is still one to watch.",

I especially liked Siwon as the second male lead, and thought he should have won out. The best friend's story was generally more interesting to me than the main story line.\n\nSome of the pink cheek stuff was cringy, but it didn't bother me too much. They tried a little too hard to dorkify the main actress. \n\nIt was interesting *because* of the friendship line in the story. \n\nI would recommend the drama as a light rom-com that isn't completely vapid. I enjoyed it. What stood out most to me was the best friend and the SML.",

            "comment": "Twenty Five Twenty One\n\nIt s a coming to age story, which tackles many aspects of growing up thought the FL story: relationship with parents, friends, romantic interest, career path/choices and how it can impact those relationships.\nWhile many ppl in this sub focuses on the romantic relationship, I personally think that it is the relationship development between Na Hee Do and Go Yu Rim that is the main driver of the story.\n\nThe good: \n\nthe show was consistent and well paced from the beginning to the end (no fillers episode). since it s a coming to age story, it s is well balanced and it covers relationship development over years, so everything felt organic. \nThe cinematography is top notched (the opening scene during the fencing championship is breathtaking). \n\nThe bad:\n\nAt the beginning, Go Yu Rim is a tuff sale with quite some nasty takes on Na Hee Do (which is impossible to not love) but when you have the full picture over the years, and how they are part of each other life well into adulthood, it s just a fantastic development. \nMany here in the sub were not pleased with how things went between the ML and FL. But personally, I felt that it made it authentic for a coming to age story and appreciate that writers went into this direction. \n\nThe interesting:\n\nThe fencing !",

In an episode about medical malpractice, a grieving father promised his daughter fish-shaped biscuits, and continues to buy a bag full every day.\n\nI've seen the fish biscuits in other dramas but this was definitely featured. Did they create the fish-shaped biscuit vendor just for the show, or when I walk down the street in Seoul will I be able to see a sign that says \"fish-shaped biscuits\" and that's it? I'm so curious now!\n\nAlso, just finished bingeing **My Country: The New Age** and there was a scene where the FL walks across the street and my brain screamed \"you didn't look both ways! what if there's a white truck?!?!\" before remembering it's a sageuk. Thanks, brain.",

            "comment": "So I wasn't sure where to put this post but this seems relevant since it's something I noticed while watching **Taxi Driver 2** (8/16). I'm going to spoiler the entire post but to set it up, I want to compare the primary antagonist from **Vincenzo** (2021) with a featured antagonist from TD2. If you haven't watched all of Vincenzo and half of TD2, there will be spoilers.\n\n&gt;!So Ok Taec-yeon plays Jang Jun-woo in !&lt;**Vincenzo**. &gt;!He's the CEO of a conglomerate but remains hidden from the public for... reasons? He masquerades as a bumbling legal aide so he can work with the FL, Hong Cha-young (Jeon Yeo-been) and when his ruse is revealed, he later claims to be in love with her, but imo he never really displayed that motivation convincingly. In fact, his character seems to reflect whatever is necessary for the plot, rather than any motivation beyond \"he be crazy\". !&lt;\n\n&gt;!In contract, Shin Jae-ha plays On Ha-joon in TD2. I'm only on Episode 8 so far (NHL playoffs, natch), and in my humble opinion, On Ha-joon is the character Jang Jun-woo !&lt;*should* &gt;!have been. On Ha-joon is working as a taxi driver for Rainbow Taxi, but is also an executive with a shadowy evil conglomerate, and is using his position at the taxi service to get closer to this team that keeps foiling all their evil plans. By Ep8, Ha-joon has already saved Do-ki's life at least once, and has moved into his building and scoped out his apartment for clues to his trauma recovery, as well. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!At every point, Ha-joon seems to have a plan. He's using his undercover taxi driver persona to gather the info necessary to protect his business interests. Now, lest we think he's not a bad guy, he threatens the Police Commissioner in a scene that is gloriously menacing, effortlessly code switching from cheerful submission to calmly dominant. Ha-joon is shown living his dual life with ease and with his eyes continually on the prize of bringing down Rainbow Taxi.!&lt;\n\nWhen I first watched **Vincenzo**, the lack of clear motivation for the primary antagonist made the ending fall flat for me. &gt;!The female antagonist, Choi Myung-hee (Kim Yeo-jin) was much more fleshed out and her motivation more understandable, but Jun-woo seemed even more aimless by comparison to Myung-hee. His crush on the FL and obsession with bringing Vincenzo down just feel like whims, or momentary clear thoughts floating in a sea of narcissism. Best boy Kwak Dong-yeon (as Jang Han-seo, Jun-woo's younger brother) deserved so much better!!&lt;\n\nSo that's my TED Talk about the thoughts I had while watching TD2. Whether the rest of season 2 drops the ball on villain development, I do not know, but I am enjoying finding out.",

This far from the first time I\u2019ve seen  mom abandon kids in Kdramas, but before they at least went with an aunt or grandma.  Straight to an orphanage?  Mom seems to have married money too, she lives in a huge house now.  I know it\u2019s cultural but this makes my head hurt.",

It\u2019s in one of the later episodes. I was genuinely amazed how I didn\u2019t catch it earlier. The symbolism is so strong here. The flower bud had already appeared once he stated falling in love and then the butterfly died.",

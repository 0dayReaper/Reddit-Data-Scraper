At first I had thought she was just an ordinary woman who fell in love with the wrong man and had sold the house to save her sons business. Now, I feel so bad for the ML and hope the FL will find a way to punish her without hurting the ML.\n\nFinally, ML is mouth watering",

Woo Joo is cruel on words but is kind to Dong Jin on actions. In fact, her \"revenge\" is so out of hurt and pure impulse that it is difficult to be taken seriously.\n\nSide note: did anyone feel bad for Dong Jin when he told Min Young that hiking was the only interesting thing about him and asked her not to break up with him there as to not ruin hiking for him?\n\nAs for the other characters, besides Min Young, everyone is a great addition to the show. Min Young...I just don't understand why the evil ex can never move on. She was cheating on him for a YEAR. Imagine how little you should care about someone to do this for that long.",

I have most of the word from [Lee Kwang Young](https://mydramalist.com/people/23567-lee-kwang-young) and none of them have a similar directing as Call It Love.  On another hand, Disney has a tendency to colour code its shows. \n\nActually, if you want to check out shows from the same director, I would recommend The Secret Life of My Secretary. It is a rom-com and starring the same main lead.",

Suddenly I couldn\u2019t remember any other drama which didn\u2019t have an animated opening. Good on you, drama!!! \n2. It really sucks you in. Maybe it the music or the pink filter or the visuals. Maybe it\u2019s the pacing. I find myself snapping out into reality when I need to pause it and deal with stuff (I was watching it outside) \n3. ML you tall, beautiful man. I hope you find all the happiness in the world and get out of depression and get rid of your horrible mom. \n4. I can already sense how much I\u2019m gonna love the group. The drama poster suggests ML is gonna be in the group as well. I have no idea how it\u2019s gonna happen but I\u2019d love that. \n\nFL is so complex. I think even she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing. She surely doesn\u2019t have a plan lmao. And now her want for ML to fail is clashing with her morals or conscience or whatever. So fun to watch. I don\u2019t want her to hurt herself though. Although if she turns around eventually like how Lee Ji-an does in \u201cMy Mister\u201d, I\u2019m 100% here for it. Come to think of it, there\u2019s so much similarity to My Mister. Good!! there needs to be more drama like My Mister. \n\nCurrently I\u2019m swooning over the older sister\u2019s vision of the couple where &gt;! FL is dressed up so pretty.!&lt; it\u2019s so cute I think I\u2019m gonna die. \n\n+++++++++++++++++++++\n\nOkay, cut to the end of the episode. I am so moved. ML\u2019s acting is 10/10. When he avoided his ex-gf: that scene was stellar. How they put the roaring of his ears in the background was wow. \n\nEx girlfriend is quite the character. \n\nThe last scene- mind blowing. Wonder if it was on purpose that they highlighted him stopping her hit him. Is he gonna turn around his life? \n\nAnyways this drama is beautiful. A+ can\u2019t wait for next week!",

Major sulky and I can fix him vibes \ud83d\ude02 except he\u2019s not super mean and rude to the FL - yay! I hate when MLs act like that and we are just supposed to accept when they start acting nice. The actor is soooo handsome - he\u2019s so tall and naturally good looking. It\u2019s refreshing not seeing a ML with piles of makeup piled on\u2026\n\nML\u2019s pain is understandable and I feel so bad for him. I am already hating the ex, and her &gt;!moving in right next door!&lt; trope, ugh. The actor is doing an amazing job at showing how absolutely down he is and always has been\u2026even as a child. \n\nFL - I like how her trauma is really being driven home. The flash back scenes are appropriately placed and not tacky or distracting. The car scene from when she was a child was heart breaking. \n\nI won\u2019t lie, I have a bit of a soft spot for the FL because I too as a child discovered the infidelity of my father with another woman (TMI, I know) but the anger, hurt, resentment that she shows is so real. She may be taking it a bit too far, but I can literally understand where she is coming from\u2026it\u2019s the shattering moment you realize the person you idolized isn\u2019t who you thought they were, and that your relationship will probably never be the same as it was before\u2026\n\nThe scene were ML\u2019s mother didn\u2019t even &gt;!recognize her!&lt; was so terrible.

I already 100% ship the hell out of the two leads. I love the way the team illustrates things, too. There are so many shots where there is more empty space in the scene than you would think (like shooting them mid chest-&gt;up instead of waist-&gt;up so that more of the frame is just ... not the human beings in the scene.) It makes scenes feel lonely.\n\nI also think they're doing a great job showing her thinking about and worrying over him while she 'hates' him. Really anticipating the next episodes.",

Poor man!!&lt;\n* WJ is mad at DJ because \"he's full of weak spots\" and trusts her, like a fool! She keeps thinking about him eating ramen alone at the convenience store! She's obsessed with what a lonely, pathetic loser he is! I'm cackling. Whatever it takes, I guess.\n* We meet Minyoung again.&gt;! She hid from DJ when she saw him on the street, but now she's bothering his friend/co-president at the indoor golf facility he goes to and smiling perkily like nothing happened? What's her deal? I might suspect the friend was the guy she cheated on DJ with, but he seems shocked and displeased to see her, so I doubt it.!&lt;\n* &gt;!\"I LET MY GIRLFRIEND CHEAT ON ME FOR A YEAR\" \"I'M NOT INTERESTED IN OTHER PEOPLE'S MISERY\" insert fire emoji here.!&lt; Their one-on-one conversations are always so insane lmaooooo. I love them.\n* OK, I'm just ignoring all the colour filters at this point, meditating and convincing myself they're not here, OMMMMMMM\n* Wow, WJ's dad really is a colossal piece of shit. &gt;!Not only did he abandon his three children and housewife and take all his money with him so they couldn't even support themselves, but also he even HIT WOOJOO WITH HIS CAR before that? Da fuck! I mean, it wasn't his fault because she jumped out in front of the car, but how could he carry on with his affair after that?!&lt; WJ, he's not worth it! Move on!\n* WOOJOO, NO! DON'T DO IT! YOU'LL REGRET THIS LATER!\n\n**Episode 4**\n\n* &gt;!OMG, Hyeseong and Jigoo are scoping out DJ and ask him to drink beer with them! They're so cute! Unclench a little, Dongjin! It's good for you to meet new people!!&lt;\n* THE REVERSE WRIST-GRAB! After the reverse hug-save! I love the little gender-swapped romance clich\u00e9s they feed us.\n* &gt;!DOES IT FEEL GOOD TO JUST SAY WHATEVER IS ON YOUR MIND? TO YOU IT MAY SEEM LIKE PEOPLE HOLD THEMSELVES BACK BECAUSE THEY'RE DUMB. BUT!!&lt; Dongjin is finally sick of Woojoo bullying him all the time lmao. This is the first time we've seen him fired up about anything. ~~It's a tiny bit hot.~~\n* OK, I'm team Hyeseong all the way here. &gt;!Everyone treats her like an idiot for not knowing the massive secret they're deliberately hiding from her, and blames her for dating shitty men. Let her live! It's not her fault men are trash and her sister is conspiring against her father's mistress's son behind her back. The way she approached DJ was pushy, but her intentions were good.!&lt; Also everyone says she's a terrible judge of character, but she read DJ like an open book.\n* Also EL OH EL at Woojoo wearing a dress in HS's recollection of the scooter incident instead of her awful tracksuit.\n* WAIT, &gt;!HE WAITED FOR MINYOUNG TO DUMP HIM?!?! HE DIDN'T EVEN DO THE DUMPING?!?!?!?!!&lt; Dongjin, you really are a fucking loser! He needs a strong woman by his side to make sure other people don't take advantage of him because he canNOT stand up for himself. I wonder who will come forward, though...\n* OK, but I have to say the way WJ effortlessly asserts dominance over Sunwoo in all their interactions and he's clearly scared of her even though she's the lowliest employee at his company is so funny.\n* Minyoung is so annoying! &gt;!Girl, what are you trying to do here? You didn't just cheat on your boyfriend! You cheated on him FOR A YEAR! While he knew and you knew that he knew! And then you told him you were getting married to your sidepiece and left! There's no coming back from that, Jesus Christ! Move on with your life instead of moving into your ex's building and trying to win over the people around him behind his back and helping his company so he would be indebted to you! That would be really creepy and manipulative EVEN IF you had any right to ask him to give you a second chance, which you don't. You're a beautiful and successful businesswoman, so go live your best life somewhere else instead of acting shameless and selfish and pathetic. God.!&lt; I'm already fuming about this puta, so I don't know how I'm going to survive the next 12 episodes.\n* OK, this episode was frustrating from a romantic development standpoint &gt;!because it started out with WJ being mad at DJ because of his mother and then had almost no interactions between them in the second half and way too much Minyoung for my liking, but the end was quite the tease! I can't wait to see how WJ will help DJ turn around the company's fortunes next week.!&lt;",

The romance in Familiar Wife has a similar vibe as well, even though there's a fantasy element and the show is less similar to the others here.\n\nIf you're interested in jdramas, Long Vacation, Nagareboshi &amp; Neechan no Koibito are just a few titles that come to mind. The first two are older, but don't let that put you off; I think retro j-romance was way better than kdramas and jdramas nowadays in many ways. Those Japanese directors were masters of portraying silent passion and romantic tension between ordinary people.",

She has this \"lightness\" about her that is in direct contrast to the heaviness that seems to sit on both Woo Joo and Dong Jin.  \n\nHer head in the clouds attitude might annoy some but I find it endearing and wish we had more like her in the world.\n\nFinally Dong Jin is now pretty close to number one on my all-time list of K-drama leads that need a hug.

I usually need leads to look hot for me to watch but, surprisingly, I wasn\u2019t mindful of how everyone looks here. They all have charm and are lovable. The leads also have very strong chemistry which you can feel sparks as early as now even if they\u2019re not doing any romantic stuff yet. It\u2019s refreshing because a few of recent Kdramas I\u2019ve watched had me struggle with the romance because I don\u2019t feel \u201csparks\u201d between the leads.",

Also I was wondering for a short time why Taera was driving an Audi, since the drama had a Cadillac PPL .... ok got the reason later (&gt;!RIP white Audi!&lt;).\n\nOne aspect I liked is that the beginning is quite fast-paced compared to Last Empress and Penthouse, where the beginning are dragging and I had to fight past the first episodes.\n\nSince it is a Makjang I have to remind myself that everybody is suspect, nothing makes sense and start from the worst possible outcome, so the worst possible outcome right now is that Taeras lost brother &gt;!is her husband Jaehyun even though I don't know if it fits age-wise at all. If not, they might play at least with the possibility with it.!&lt;",

While a bit of shaky cam can induce tension, the amount of it in these combat scenes is breaking the flow of movements for me and I find myself wishing they'd do more zoomed out full-body shots to really show off the combat dynamics.\n\nI did chuckle a bit at the opening scene when I recognized that Red was playing PUBG -- as a non-gamer myself, I'd never really heard of this game until Taeyeon did a promotion for it but even then, I wouldn't have recognized it easily. The only reason why I recognized it this time was the *WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER* phrase which I've learned about fairly recently from reading a bunch of Chinese webnovels with a gaming-obsessed character. \n\nBy the way, the credits say that Red is an 'Animatronic Chimp Costume' that was developed by [Elcarimat FX](http://www.fxelcarimat.com.ar/). Red isn't listed in the portfolio but they do have a video on previous [chimp characters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pOWk6Pegwg) that show the creation process in case you're interested.\n\nNeed to dig into PPL later, hoping its jewelry is PPL so it works for my challenge.\n\nAlso saw in the credits that there's three filming teams (A,B,C), which feels like a lot as I think I see two teams most of the time.",

He didn't have 'loved ones' before the first season. He was estranged from his brother and he didn't really think of the people at the afterlife/spirit hunting place as 'family/loved ones'.\n\nLoved ones may even refer to Ji Ah and possibly a child. The ending is kind of ambiguous&gt;!, he fights with gumiho powers against a creature... but he also was talking about living as a human and experiencing human pain. So either he gained the ability to pretend to be a human more explicitly or he may have something that keeps his gumiho side 'locked' and releases it when needed.!&lt;\n\nIf you look at the picture you see the modern day/present version of Seoul upside down at the top so that's where he's traveled from. I think it may turn out some being traveled back in time, changed the past and that caused Ji Ah to not exist and then he goes back to fix the timeline.",

There, Lee Yeon meets Ryu Hong Joo (Kim So Yeon) again. She was once a guardian spirt of a mountain in the west, but in 1938 she is the owner of the best high-end restaurant Myoyeongak in the capital city of Gyeongseong. When Ryu Hong Joo met Lee Yeon for the first time, she was fascinated by him, but she couldn\u2019t have him. Now, she meets him again and she feels excitement. Lee Yeon also meets his younger brother Lee Rang (Kim Bum).\n&gt;\n&gt;Meanwhile, Cheon Mu Young (Ryoo Kyung Soo) used to be a guardian spirit of a mountain in the east and he used to be friends with Lee Yeon and Ryu Hong Joo. A case led Cheon Mu Young to become hostile towards him. Lee Yeon struggles to go back to the present day where his loved one lives.\n\n[Source](https://asianwiki.com/Tale_of_the_Nine_Tailed_1938)",

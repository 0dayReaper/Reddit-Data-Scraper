Our chef has a MASSIVE CRUSH and he is as good at hiding his crush as he is at drinking liquor. I guess he has an alcohol allergy which is better than what I assumed. I assumed he was an alcoholic and he was sober now and cutie egging him on was making him compromise his sobriety. But thankfully it seems like he is just a cheap date and 1 shot is enough for him \ud83d\ude05\n\nThe number of times boys fall down in this series is enough to warrant a drinking game while watching. Hopefully now that they are together the falling down will slow down\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb",

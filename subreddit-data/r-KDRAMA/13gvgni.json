I want to watch more of his dramas/movies for sure \nI can\u2019t stand the mother and attorney kwon and I\u2019m curious how I\u2019ll feel in the end",

At that point I kind of knew how the show was going to end.(Those final obstacles man lol) \n\nBack when I first read the synopsis I thought the show would be a lot messier in terms of conflict but everything felt so introverted and underwhelmingly quiet. It had its strengths though. Definitely in the dialogue. The director took some artistic choices that kind of felt unnecessary but I still appreciate the effort. Overall I'm glad I finished it.\n\nSwitching gears to please my dark little heart,I decided to watch Hunted. Its a very \"if it aint broke dont fix it\" psychological thriller. I've watched plenty of movies/shows like this but its nevertheless entertaining. Also I don't mean this in a backhanded way but I like that the cast look like everyday people.\n\nHunted has only 4 episodes so I picked up Lost again. It feels like an indie movie from the early 2000s. Its minimalist and depressing but very human.",

            "comment": "It took me the longest to finish watching **someday or oneday** and I am so glad that I stayed.\r\n\r\nIt took me almost three months to get through the first half of the drama, the work, school and college subplots couldn't immerse me much, felt generic, uneventful and slow paced. The only thing that kept me going was the flashbacks and leads' emotions. God their emotions felt so real and touching, I could really feel their heartaches.^^Recommend ^^me ^^more ^^heartfelt ^^drama ^^like ^^this ^^one ^^&lt;3\r\n\r\nThe last half of the drama with &gt;!the murder subplot and details of time travel!&lt; captivated me the most. The murderer subplot was totally unexpected and executed very well. &gt;!I wonder if the kid could suppress his psychopathic tendencies in the changed timeline without his older self motivating and grooming himself!&lt;\r\n\r\n&gt;!I was starting to have the same moral dilemma I had in **oh my ghost** so I was very satisfied with the way it got handled despite being a little dramatic towards the end. He did everything because he got triggered by FL's motivation to catch him as it would ruin his future yet he killed a guy in the middle of a street and totally sabotaged his present life. I understand his psychopathic tendencies took over his conscious thinking, still it was dramatic that he took no effort to clean his evidence or hide in a safe place. Guess he was planning to murder LZW in the old timeline!&lt;\r\n\r\nI loved that every elements of time travel was neatly executed. Even the way that triggers time travel was 'realistic' unlike most other drama. I particularly loved &gt;!certain melodies of a loved song can make one revisit memories!&lt; and the inclusion of &gt;!future events impacting the memories!&lt; was a nice change.\r\n\r\nThe &gt;!soul swapping!&lt; was also logically written, &gt;!one of similar pair of people lost the will to live so the other one with stronger desire to live that life took over that body. This part was very depressing, esp the real WQS's storyline if his trapped soul inside his own body was still conscious during the time LZW took over him!&lt;\r\n\r\n&gt;!The brothers swap also made sense since the older brother was already depressed due to their parents divorce so the younger brother with stronger consciousness overpowered his feeble mind!&lt;\r\n\r\n&gt;!Coexistence of same soul in two different bodies in the same timeline was confusing at first but made sense since everything was happening in the memory and no soul split happened rather the older soul was visiting the younger soul in the memory!&lt;\r\n\r\nThe ending was the most satisfying for me, I loved how the &gt;!alteration happened only after the entire memory was played out. Actually there wasn't any alteration, rather new memories were added when HYX took over CYR's body and brought her back from the near death!&lt;\r\n\r\n&gt;!The dream like memory at the end was a nice change to the usual everything-was-a-dream trope. I wonder if the uncle remembered to learn making coffee once the loop was broken and everything started afresh. Considering that MJJ didn't remember anything, I guess the uncle also didn't. Talking about him, I liked how gently he handled his niece's time travel storytelling with his proper understanding of mental health!&lt; I loved how none of the dialog was shallow rather substantial and touching and how casually some sensitive topics were handled with depth.\r\n\r\nI wasn't quite impressed with direction style as much as with the writing and acting, but the ending scene made it up for me. I loved the entire conversation, the cinematography, the transition of time during the last few minutes. It was artistically beautiful. \r\n\r\nThat said, I didn't like the extra added thank you scene. &gt;!The candles showing the age left a little sour taste, I liked the original vague ending more!&lt;\n\r\nHow come I forgot about the osts, they were beautifully paired with the scenes. There were only a few and were repeatedly played yet it didn't feel bad like in **something in the rain** rather it continued to sound more touching as I watched the drama.\r\n\r\nTruly a beautiful drama. The smoothest combination of genres I have seen so far. Only if the first half was handled better! Overall a **(9/10)**\r\n\nCan't recommend enough. \n\n*Edit: mod I have fixed my spoiler tags",

Maybe it's because people were disappointed with how the first season ended but so far s2 is much more entertaining. There's a lot of comedy and action to balance out the heavier scenes, including those involving the Japanese occupation of Korea. I love the focus on the relationship between the Lee Brothers and the new characters are great, especially Kim So-yeon as a former mountain god obsessed with Lee Yeon. Definitely check it out if you haven't already.",

I\u2019m at episode 50/100 and I\u2019ve watched only this since I started, which is unusual for me as I usually have two or three dramas going. \n\nI\u2019m really enjoying the characters and their relationships and while I find myself ff-ing through some less interesting side plots, that hasn\u2019t detracted from my enjoyment of this show. \n\nThe \u201csadon\u201d couple is my favourite! Lee Sang Yi\u2019s character is the greenest of green flags and has raised the bar \u2014 being there when she needs him as a friend, knowing when to wait for better timing, not hiding his feelings when confronted directly, and keeping true to his playful self.  I\u2019m so happy to see so much of him after HCCC left me wanting more!\n\nYou know that feeling where a you don\u2019t want a drama to end because you like the characters so much - I feel like I won\u2019t suffer so much from that when Once Again eventually wraps up.  But maybe I\u2019m wrong!",

But the pace of the show is still quite slow.\n\nI started **Moment at Eighteen** (3/16). The first episode was very slow, but I'm finding myself drawn in. It's definitely a quiet, meditative drama.\n\nI recently started **Suspicious Housekeeper**  (3/20) and am still making my decision. It's an older drama and feels a bit more low budget than others from that era. The premise intrigues me. Seems like a family drama (with about the budget of a family drama), a healing drama, and a...mystery or melodrama all mashed into one? I think I'll keep watching. \n\n**Why Didn't I Tell You a Million Times?\",** the latest Japanese drama on Netflix, starring Satoh Takeru, the main lead in **First Love.** I really loved **First Love**, binged it in one weekend. I'm not sure that lightning will strike twice, however.",

Why didn't I tell you a million times for the sole reason of being a fan of Satoh. To be 100 percent honest, it feels outdated and doesn't really hold up as a 2023 drama. It doesn't have the same production quality as First-Love but I will continue it for Satoh lol.",

It reminds me of *Arrested Development*, in the juxtaposition of broad, sometimes slapstick humor, and more subtle sight gags, puns, and references. (You do have to be somewhat of a kdrama aficionado to get those. I'm sure I'm missing some.)\n\nThen again, I guess AD was never all that popular either.\n\nETA: *Better Off Ted* is another similar show, and also very funny.",

The ensemble cast is really top notch and so many fun cameos. Loved the bit with Kang Hyun Min's mother &gt;!faking her hospitalization!&lt;, so much fun!

I personally don\u2019t watch many movies/dramas with these types of age differences (not that I look their ages or anything, sometimes it\u2019s obvious). \n\nThe Goblin, I couldn\u2019t finish because of the blatant age difference. I know he\u2019s supposed to be 999 years old or something but it was a huge turn off.",

Their age gap is only 10 years and Lee Honey is an incredible actress and to be honest I\u2019ve grown up watching shows/films of men being so many years older than women (Hollywood) that it\u2019s so refreshing seeing the roles reversed. Women deserve love regardless of age and just because they\u2019re 35+ doesn\u2019t mean they automatically have to be with someone their age or older. He\u2019s 28 and she\u2019s 38 and they\u2019re both very attractive adults and will give us a great show (hopefully \ud83e\udd1e) \nI hope the drama is great, Lee Honey is an amazing actress and so funny as well \ud83d\ude2d",

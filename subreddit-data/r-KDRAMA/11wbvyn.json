It was finally made clear the feelings are pretty mutual, and she\u2019s been feeling them all along. She\u2019s just not wiling to acknowledge them to herself (bc she\u2019s been shown to be a pragmatic person: why fight an arranged marriage if she has no choice and she knows her father chose a good man, why not convince yourself you\u2019re thrilled and like your fianc\u00e9, why admit to any feelings for the CP when the prospect of her, an accused murderess on the run, ever having a future with him seems pretty doomed to begin with, etc.) \n\nNow that we are hearing her thoughts about Hwan for once, not the reverse, all those times she lingered to spend more time with him, cared about him above her own safety, curled her toes when he said he saw her as a woman, made her shadow cling to his, mooned over the prospect of that bracelet being for her, made that drunken ridiculous suggestion to be head eunuch for ever\u2026 that all can be put in a different context. Turns out, those were the actions of a woman secretly in love with someone who she had no hopes of a future with, who was just cherishing her moments with him while she could. It\u2019s quite romantic, in hindsight.\n\n,",

It made little sense to me at the time, but is proving more and more apropos. This drama is ultimately about the younger generation using their smarts and hope to transcend the obstacles and ugly politics of the previous generation to build a new, better Joseon, in a way that the previous generation can\u2019t or isn\u2019t willing to.

He must\u2019ve thought \u201cwell I love the crown prince too but not *that* much\u201d. I wonder how they will intergrate Jae-yi into the court as a crown princess. Even if her name is cleared, she still disguised herself as a eunuch and decieved the court (and the king which is a crime as far as I know). Her father is dead which means she has no clout from him and no relative that has enough clout either. Maybe they\u2019ll go the Bloody Heart way and forcefully fake her ID or the King\u2019s Affection way and &gt;!escape the palace to live a new life which I think is unlikely!&lt;",

I'm also curious to know who is threatening the Queen, and what she plans she has up her sleeve. \n\nI quite appreciate that more than half way through, I still don't know just where this story will take us.",

So I wonder if wearing the bracelet doesn\u2019t poison you, since Jaeyi was safe, but somehow it releases poison into surrounding food\u2026?\n\nMy only other comment is that Hwan is an idiot. I spent the last several episodes up til ep 13 complaining about Jaeyi being oblivious to Hwan\u2019s feelings and her own\u2026 but it turns out home girl knew everything, and felt everything, but just didn\u2019t voice it or act on it cuz she had no expectations other than to stay by his side. I now realize Hwan is the oblivious one. She\u2018s literally telling you you\u2019re the idiot she\u2019s been throwing love sparks at, the one who goes back and forth between the palace and outside, and he\u2019s still puzzling over who it could possibly be \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. When Myung Jin started going on and on about a girl in love with him, I was afraid Hwan would jump to the wrong conclusion and think he was the one Jaeyi liked. Thankfully he\u2019s not \\*that\\* dumb. Still pretty dumb though. As an aside, that song Garam led them in was cute. I thought for a hot second we might be lucky enough to hear PHS\u2019s angelic voice (seriously, who does a girl have to bribe to get PHS on an OST track?!), but alas, I guess it wouldn\u2019t make sense for uptight, sheltered Hwan to be freely singing in public.",

That it is not the idealization from afar that is the truth of it, but rather something that must evolve slowly and naturally.\n\nWe have seen this clearly with the CP.  To us, it is now undeniable.  The sergeant...even though he may yet be unaware of her true identity as his fiance, has spent enough time with her to form a relationship...but it is one of deep respect rather than affection, of loyal friendship rather than a romantic love.\n\nSo, I don't think he will be brokenhearted over it...though I still wish for him his own happy resolution.",

I think the ML takes some time to show some dimension, but it's worth it when he does.  The romance is more mutual-respect slow burn than angsty.  Strong SML syndrome.  Side characters are fun and interesting although the forensic scientist guy takes a bit to get used to.\n\nOverall I would recommend it although it probably won't end up in my top 10.  I would like to see more from the lead and secondary actors though.",

Tortured, sad, lonely ML who is super feminist and falls first and hard. - ParkHyungSik brings a lot of depth and turmoil to this character. I'm convinced that the actor prefers working on projects where the FL is so strong and self-sufficient. He does a great job.\n\n2.) STRONG, BADASS FL. - Not much to add other than the fact that so far, this female lead is the most feminist one I've ever seen in a Kdrama and it has me straight GIDDY. \n\n3.) No long and drawn-out conflicts that are too overly dramatic. Most issues are solved within an episode (except for the obvious main conflict.)\n\n4.) Mystery that I have yet to figure out on my own, which keeps me guessing.\n\n5.) Natural lead chemistry. Nothing seems forced. The very subtle flirting between the leads is *awesome*.",

It\u2019s as if he knows that sharing the limelight with such female co-stars allows each of them to shine a little brighter. Park generally doesn\u2019t showboat on screen, always playing reserved characters who win us over with their stolid attributes.

Jae Yi finally started to admit her feelings to herself !&lt; . And I loved that we got so many action scenes in this episode..the drama has really been picking up pace in the last few episodes.

Some wrongdoing on their part so severe that it caused the subjects to rise against them?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI like the fact that this sageuk has more than one obvious antagonist.  There are so many parties here, and shades of grey, that I'm really enjoying it.   At least episode 13 has confirmed that the King&gt;! cares for the CP and wants him protected.!&lt;\n\n*Edit = spelling*",

But given that she's shown (potentially performative?) kindness to Hwan, I doubt her goal is to get her child to ascend. She's been so supportive of her child, without pushing him to be the perfect fit for the throne (letting him eat as much as he wants, coddling him, not forcing him to study or learn archery, etc)  and that makes me think that her goals aren't political in the sense of gaining ruling power. I think she wants to use her position to set the historical record straight, and/or avenge the lives that were unjustly taken. \n\nAdditionally, if she wanted to get rid of the Yi's, she'd be putting herself (and her child) in danger, since her power is an extension of the kings (and quite limited -- and it could be seen as treason). And if she succeeded in ostracizing the Yi's - then she too would be kicked out of the palace (or killed), wouldn't she?\n\nRE: Her people -- I am not sure if Court Lady Kwon is a double agent (or whose side she's *really* on), but I do think the folks she has placed in the East Palace (like Court Lady Choi) are on her side. \n\nWhat did you mean by her being ruthless with regards to her uncle? I don't think she had anything to do with the death of Oh Man Sik and his family?",

And I don't doubt that Tae-gang ISN'T the assassin, but I am not yet 100% convinced that he is strictly loyal to Hwan (or that he doesn't have any special interests).\n\nTo me, it seems like the Queen has several folks in the East Palace (mostly Court Ladies, but I am certain it's not limited to Court Ladies). And if I remember correctly, there were scenes where a person dressed in men's clothes left notes under the rocks.\n\nEDIT: To clarify, I thought that the \"she\" that Court Lady Kwon was referring to was the other Court Lady filtering information to them, not the assassin per se. I don't know if the assassin's gender has been revealed yet?",

He certainly does not seem to be loyal in the way all the others of our gang are...else he would have insisted on coming along with them; indeed, I half expected him to have secretly followed them, coming at the last minute to their rescue.  But he did not.  \n\nYou are also probably right about who the \"she\" was...but wait, lol...if so, why not use her name instead of just \"she\"?  We don't know the gender of the assassin, but I think we do know it is a slight figure, not some hulking behemoth, lol.  This could, just could be a deliberate tease for us, the viewers.\n\nThere are two things that are hidden here...the identity of the assassin and why that assassin could be mistaken for Tae-gang.  Occam's razor would dictate the simplest solution...that both questions have the same answer.\n\nBut then again...this is driving me nuts!",

Everything seemed woven more tightly this ep to me. Also, I've been rather disappointed with the romance up until now, but not after this episode. &gt;!there growing love for one another, which was so gradual and natural with the little things they said and did for each other that I think most of us missed it!&lt; It all makes sense to me now and was believably portrayed. I also liked that both of them didn't have a &gt;!*realization* that they loved eachother, but rather regretted that it wasn't said, it came across as if it was a silent understanding between them!&lt; really hope they don't mess it all up with noble idiocy.\n\nThis is just me, but since FL can't recall all of her memories leading up to her families slaughter, I kinda wish they would've thrown us for a loop by making her have a split personality but alas, they can't make the FL the villain so I'll settle for the guard or his evil twin being the family killer. \n\nOk, after episode 14, I take back the \"silent understanding\" of love between them. Apparently, the CP is still unaware, ha ha!",

I\u2019m convinced he knows deep down, because have you noticed that every time Jaeyi gets too close to revealing her true feelings he seems to bring up Sung On? Every time Jaeyi voices a preference for Hwan to him, about wanting to stay by his side, etc, he likes it too much, which leads his guilty conscience to try to send her back to her \u201cbetrothed\u201d. This, despite her pointedly telling him she didn\u2019t really love Sung On and didn\u2019t want to go back to him, and instead wants to stay by Hwan\u2019s side so much she suggested becoming his head eunuch. \n\nI\u2019ve wondered for weeks why Jaeyi keeps saying no every time Hwan suggested coming clean to Sung On\u2014 aside from the first time when she said it was because she didn\u2019t want to burden him, and bc the murders seemed connected to Hwan, the subsequent excuses never made sense to me. And coming clean to Sung On was the honorable thing to do, which is why Hwan keeps suggesting it despite his growing attachment to Jaeyi\u2014 why did she keep refusing and putting Hwan in a position to be unfair to his best friend? Now we know it\u2019s because she wants to stay by Hwan\u2019s side as long as possible. And Hwan\u2019s got to realize this on some level. So yes, he\u2019s an idiot, but I think he is noticing her loving looks/comments but willfully pushing away the possibility that his feelings are requited. He feels guilty enough for having feelings and keeping Jaeyi from Sung On; if he acknowledges she returns his feelings, his guilt will be through the roof and he will have to do something about the untenable situation, which may lead to separation from Jaeyi, when all he wants is an excuse to keep her close for longer. So he tries to \u201cpush\u201d her away, but not that much bc ultimately he doesn\u2019t want her to go, and even gets jealous whenever she shows any preference for someone else, even when it\u2019s Sung On (at the polo match).",

Previously i thot CP was the one who was in love bt nt FL nw it's d other way around. In episode 13 where CP bought a bracelet for FL bt didn't give it to her as d bracelet latr will hold importance for I think he will give it to her wen he himself realises the truth dat he loves FL n dat bracelet wil become the symbol of love from him to her.  Upcoming episode will definitely test dere feelings for each other as the impending marriage of CP is a big problem for dem both. Another thot did u guys noticed the new crown Princess was hiding a jade ring wen SL her cousin came towards her? Y was she hiding? N wich episode do u guys think d long awaited kiss will happen?",

Her crying over Hwan\u2019s near death was dialed to 11 and went on a bit long, but it also does seem like a directorial choice to make sure Sung On noted her reaction as more than expected. \n\nHer crying when Hwan tried to send her away was a softer weep. Having Hwan back, having promised to herself she was going to \u201ctell him something\u201d (confess\u2014 which she ended up doing circuitously), only to have him tell her he was sending her back to Sung On broke her heart. She knew she and Hwan didn\u2019t have a future, but she was was fighting back as best she could for every moment she could remain by his side, and ultimately succeeded in standing her ground. What I mean to say is, I appreciated that it was two different types of crying, and the second scene in particular was very watchable, so I wanted to commend her for what I perceive to be improvements. \n\nAlso, I want to commend her that her crying, even in scenes when I\u2019ve felt it\u2019s dialed a bit high in intensity, is never nearly as bad or unwatchable as Go Ara\u2019s scrunched-face incessant wailing from Hwarang. I\u2019m still traumatized by that.",

I like the FL overall, i just don't get why strong FL have to cry so much and mostly when its not needed (same in Flower of Evil and others) which makes me think its the director rather than the acting. Maybe its what the director thinks people want to see but cant please everyone. I will say the FL does do crying well, I might just have to fast forward bits for the next episode..",

I agree with you that was a bit much. But I do think a directorial choice.

Hwan trusts him, but she trusts her memory and he looks like someone responsible for murdering her family, so I don\u2019t blame her. And none of them expected a team of assassins, they were only going to meet one guy to talk to him. Ultimately, Hwan is the CP and he should\u2019ve overridden Jaeyi\u2019s wishes and made the call to bring Tae Gang since he\u2019s so convinced of his guard\u2019s loyalty, so this fiasco is kind of on him.

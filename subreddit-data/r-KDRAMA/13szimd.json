            "comment": "This week I spotted a scene from **Just Between Lovers** in the drama, **Moment at Eighteen.** BUT the characters are supposedly watching a movie in the theater. At the end of episode 8, Soo Bin and Jun U go to the theater. Near the end we get a view of the screen; it's the final scene from **Just Between Lovers.** In Episode 9, we hear some of the dialogue from that drama, too.\n\nSo if you're looking for a drama referenced in another drama for the 2023 kDrama challenge, you can give **Just Between Lovers** a try! **Just Between Lovers** was an \"A\" drama for me, and I think **Moment at 18** will be, too.\n\nAnother note about **Moment at 18**, sleeping with the light on (which happens a lot in kdramas for no particular reason) is actually a plot point.\n\n(edited to correct the episode in which the scene appears).",

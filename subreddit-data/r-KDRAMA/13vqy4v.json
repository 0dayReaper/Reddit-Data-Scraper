I'm now going to watch one episode a day after everything to just breathe.\n\nEdit: Finished it. It was such a good show. Ha Kyung just setting out to the trips, meeting all these other people and just experiencing life was just so wonderful to see. It showed how multi-facetted life is and how difficult but regarding it can be. \n\nI can't even name my favourite stories, they all brought so much, yet different things. Although the Jeju bread and the Dancing Kangoroo where especially heartwarming.",

The cinematography of this show in general is outstanding. Loved the theme of the passage of time throughout.\n\nEp 6 - they did a good job conveying the instrusiveness of getting work-related calls on the weekend. Gurl hates getting wet but wore a fabric shirt instead of a rainjacket??? I also hate rain but it does look beautiful in this episode. The fellow teacher's earnestness and dedication to his job is so admirable. Also is it normal for teachers to be hanging out w students on the weekends, going for meals, and taking their phone calls? The korean education system is so different. Our teachers in my country had nothing to do w us outside of work hours lol unless they were chaperoning something like a dance or a school trip. Omg she had an umbrella when she left the museum! So she lost both her credit card and her umbrella somehow. Wait who was that lady at the end who ate part of her pancake? (Omg it was her friend jinsol from ep 8)\n\nEp 7 - Omggggggg i am adding jeju's bread map to my list of to-eats when I go to korea again. Wait this is my fave ep ever. Seogwipean bakery looks amazing. I also wanna try the mugwort bread at Namyangdang. The little girl looking for snail bread and her grandma and FL following her but pretending not to was so cute. Omg i knew her mom was dead \ud83d\ude2d it was what i thought. I couldnt help but think that the bread she bought would have tasted better fresh rather than heated up again later. I would have eaten more throughout the day rather than bringing it back home.\n\nEp 8 - wow maybe i should add gyeongju to my list too??? Not Jinsol \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d what a beautiful ode to friendship. \"I'm not growing up, but ageing\" was so relatable to me. \n\nOk despite being 8 x 25 min eps this series was so beautiful. We got friendship, romance, family, death, the passage of time, ageing, the meaning of life, the role of teachers, beautifully shot scenes and mouthwatering food. It felt very simple and clean. The themes were clear without feeling forced. Maybe one of the best things i've watched in a long time.",

I really like how we see bits of the FL\u2019s past without the show becoming a full-on narrative about it. &gt;!The whole idea of dance and its relation to life and youth was great. Also I really wish I could read that comic about the apocalypse and the cat.!&lt;",

                    "comment": "After finishing this drama, I only have good things to say! Everything from the cinematography, coloring, dialogue, and character construction was absolutely phenomenal. Like another comment alluded to, this drama really was a breath of fresh air; it provided space for me to slow down and truly just enjoy the motions of the show. \n\nAlso, for those who haven't seen it yet Lee Na-Young (the fl) had an interview on Suga's drinking show. In the interview, she really drives home the fact that this drama is about people above all else. And honestly, she's right! There's not an overarching plot, instead each episode allows us to meet someone new, and explore another perspective on life. This was something I truly needed.\n\nLastly, the last two episodes were indeed my favorite. Although I'm much inclined to represent my dude Koo Kyo-Hwan, the last two episodes discussed and displayed the intricacies of &gt;!death and healing!&lt; so beautifully, especially the last episode. Ultimately, this drama (and especially the last few episodes) inspires me to live a little more; to disappear when I need to and take a moment to wander, explore, and of course eat some delicious food! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully we get to see more of these gentle, thoughtful dramas :)",

Episode 5 had so much to love in it:\n\n* Yeon Ju coming &gt;!over on her horse all knight-in-shining-armor like to rescue her guy!&lt;. We love to see it \ud83d\ude0d Though I'm sure Dong Chi didn't love to see &gt;!Han Su ditching him just like that \ud83d\ude2d !&lt;And he still &gt;!showed up later to try and save them?!&lt; AH, a loyal right hand indeed.\n* They're keeping up the pace and I'm so glad since so many historicals like this have had a seriously lag problem. And with the case-of-the-week (every 2 eps they've been going for) format I don't see that being a problem for this show. I really hope I'm right!\n* THE ROMANCE. I'm surprised by how much I'm enjoying this. Usually this point in the show is a little too soon for me to be seeing romance like this but somehow they're really selling it to me. I love their more serious scenes and the bickering and shenanigans too. I like that they're partners who work together and go on adventures together. Are we actually going to be getting a love triangle at all here? My apologies to Ji Sun who I like very much despite the little I've seen of him but I will not be getting SL syndrome this time \ud83d\ude05\n* **LADY HONG.** 'NUFF SAID.\n* The group dynamic is very fun here. I like that the leads have brought their two trusted people together to form this clownish (not you, Lady Hong) ragtag team lol\n* The actors they're pulling into this show are killing it? Her name is already escaping me but the performance of &gt;!our murderer!&lt; in ep 5 was so good\n\nAs for things I don't like there isn't much! I'm enjoying myself. However I could do with less of the over-the-top comedy...it doesn't always jive with the rest of the episode. Many of the other comedy bits are totally fine and fun. But like...the whole &gt;!BEAR THING?!&lt; I could've done without that \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\n\nAm I the only one still tuning into this? If not, how's everyone else liking it at this point?",

They\u2019ll do something slightly before or after.\n\nI also love how they essentially reverse the cliffhanger\n\nAnd instead of writing in a style that keeps you on your seat at the end of the week for next week (often just to be hoodwinked bc they DONT know how to develop a cliffhanger) they\u2019ve done this a few times now where they\u2019ll START the week off with a fairly significant reveal and then spend the weeks two episodes exploring it \n\nIt\u2019s SUPER FUN and addicting in a whole new way. But hopefully hopefully fingers crossed - it also means the writing really does know itself. Its not throwing things out *merely* to keep you hooked at the end of the week. It just writes a story for two whole episodes that actually just keeps you interested. That it\u2019s their STARTING point that is heavy in interest and not their ENDING point that throws out a cheapshot to hook you in. \n\nI like that ! \n\nAnyway. \n\nI\u2019m writing this at 3 minutes into the episode because that first scene was like OH OKAY!!!! THATS THE STARTING POINT ??? You got me!",

                    "comment": "Back again after finishing the episode \n\nOk. \n\nFirst off \n\nTHIS EP WAS GENUINELY JUST SOOOOO GOOOOOOD. not even compared to other eps in the drama - just as it\u2019s own \u201cthing\u201d compared to all episodes in kdrama land - I just thought this episode was really close to fantastic. Beautiful writing. Perfectly paced. SO MUCH HAPPENED. and this drama is just REALLY FILLING OUT. \n\n- - \n\nthe romance in this was lovelyyyyyyyyyy!!!! I didn\u2019t think it was overdone (I thought last weeks episodes were super off on their dynamic and the final ep was just like NO !!!! TOO MUCH) \n\nBut a) I loved that they moved on (for the time being at least) from the ultra romance of last weeks ending and it\u2019s like it never happened haha!. I was expecting that to be where this ep picked up. That it didn\u2019t was like OK! YES! (Honestly it\u2019s so disjointed and uneven when you think about it - I\u2019m a little confused - it\u2019s like the writers know the end goal, but just divided the weeks amongst themselves and then don\u2019t talk to each other at all lol!!!! Like it\u2019s like I don\u2019t think the writers of ep 5+6 even know the swoon scene happened??? Lolll)\n\nB) this was soooo cutteeee. I loved all these little hand hold scenes. Again - that THAT is what she\u2019s blushing over after last weeks ep is HILARIOUS. Re: do the writers know what happened?? But I felt that that was very realistic and right on for where they should be at this point. I liked this ep because it was more about them being there for each other than anything super romanticized. Sweet. \n\nWhat was that preview for tomorrow though??\n\n\n\n- - \nMy main one complaint is \n\nThey\u2019re still struggling with really situating yeon ju and her development . There was progress made today when she finally just got attacked by the villagers for needing a massive reality check. \n\nI wish they would write her already with just a tad bit more nuance and self awareness that she herself is LEARNING and thinking through some big big questions and struggling with her worldview, her big beliefs, and how you put everything together. But instead we just keep on going back to \u20ac\u00a3!%#level 0 where she has to have these pout attacks about how the world works according to her and her set of morals. \n\nThere\u2019s a way for them to have the conversations they\u2019re having and for her to not always have to back herself up in that sammmeeee corner for fivvveeee episodes. And I wish they would start. \n\nThe convo they had when tied up was interesting in that regard. There she said something like \u201cno I don\u2019t agree. But I\u2019m curious to see how you would do it\u201d\n\nThat was interesting . That\u2019s new interesting ground. \n\nBut also in its own way problematic in that .. either she\u2019s backing herself up into her sheltered corner of YEON JU ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE WORLD AND LAW \u2122\ufe0f or she just totally abandons her moral/intellectual autonomy and hands it ALL over to Kang Han Soo?\n\nThe more I think about it. The more this might be a very clear case of bad acting on bonas part. Maybe it is there in the writing - but her manner of delivering these lines takes out the potential for expressing how much she\u2019s trying to figure things out internally.",

And I wanna chalk it up to bad co writing. It can be SO GOOD - and reminds me of all the amazing elements of Queen for 7 Days- and then just fails to do something critical. \n\nI was really hoping that after ep 5\u2019s phenomenal set up we would finally get some great Yeon Ju development in this episode where she really thinks about things and comes to a new stage of balancing * tensions* of reality / ideals and law/  life. \n\nEp 5 ends on such a great note where she\u2019s really struggling with feeling like she\u2019s pitting two thing against each other that she NEVER knew could collide before re: She\u2019s held up to Kang this whole time that he\u2019s the unfeeling one who uses (abuses) the law while she\u2019s the one that places victims and their pain front and center and THAT PAIN is what the law promises to heal. (Re: law is like a pouch to catch tears ). With this case she\u2019s now stumped because her belief in the law means that she\u2019s the unfeeling one who can\u2019t fully sympathize and support someone with very real grievances. \n\nand I adored that after the reductive nonesense of their fighting in ep 3/4 where there\u2019s none of the nuance or curiosity that ep 1/2 has set up \u2014 ep 5 picked up almost exactly where ep 2 ended and she ended with that great line when they\u2019re tied up saying   \u201cI\u2019m really up in the air and struggling with how the law works here to be on this girls side, and I can\u2019t help but side with law and that\u2019s uncomfortable for me because \u2026 I also like this girl \u2026 but \u2026 yeah\u2026 I want to see how you can make it work\u2026\u201d \n\nBUT LIKE WHAT THE HECK \n\nTHE WRITING OFFERS ABSOLUTELY NO INSIGHT INTO HER DEVELOPMENT ?? She just all of a sudden hands over YET AGAIN all her moral and intellectual autonomy to Kang and that\u2019s that. \n\nIt really bothered me !!!! \n\nBona can\u2019t do anything but bland sweetie - so we are agreed that even if the writing was good she\u2019d struggle delivering\n\nBut this was definitely a fail for writing as well. There was just NOTHING there besides her going \u201cdude be right ok kewl.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s such a waste. Because the drama could do the development here \u2014 have you seen Queen for 7 days ? - it\u2019s so epic in slowly telling the development of a woman who is battling so many tough tensions. \n\nAnd you can see that pop up so often in this drama as well but they\u2019re really failing to consistently hold that thread in the plot. They drop it all the time !!! \n\nIm bummed. I was looking forward to this drama but I think ep 6 really lost me. \n\nAnd we complained about this previously. But they\u2019re increasingly missing the mark on romance. But it\u2019s so sad to me because they can HAVE IT but the writing is so uneven they can\u2019t ever keep it. I thought ep 5 had it again with chemistry. It was right where it should be and in all the best places - supportive hand holds and a growing delight in being with each other. Always with that addictive foundation of intellectual curiosity and a desire to trust the other. And then what was ep 6? It was just way too much. \n\nIt\u2019s such a bumpy ride - that the bumps knock out of the cart all the gems the writing has accrued up until that point. \n\n? That\u2019s my sentiment right now. What about you.",

It feels like the writers are at odds about whose story this is - like they disagree about who the protagonist is, so everything is just muddy mediocrity. I think that it is possible to tell the same story (including the princess story) much more efficiently. \n\nI honestly think that they are spending too much time on the princess's point of view. Basically, the audience should be viewing the lawyer through her eyes-most of us find his ways morally questionable, we want justice, etc). We need to fall for him along with her. All of that means there needs to be a greater focus on the lawyer. That simple shift in the writing would make the romance make more sense and would make the princess's journey clearer -- even if Bona continued to give a boring performance. \n\nAs it stands, the only reason I'm continuing is for Woo Do Hwan, who, despite the inconsistent script, is nailing this role.",

Me: NO! She\u2019s not even MOONLIGHTING!! She\u2019s SUNLIGHTING??!? Lol) \n\nAND NOT \n\nhave her be able to have ANY intellectual independence \n\n- - \n\nI am weary of sloppy 21st c girl boss power sageuks and how frequent they are becoming. It\u2019s funny because I think it\u2019s done to shorthand be like # yeah! Let\u2019s go ladies!!! \n\nBut in reality - all it does often is cheapen the depiction of women- they have such little dignity and strength compared to sageuks that TRY to make their women \u201cconfined\u201d to realistic options of the time \n\nI should get hit for ad nauseam repeating Queen for 7 days but comparing these two dramas to each other given they share one of the same writers is rich material. \n\nChae Gyoung is blindingly radiant in all her valiant attempts to claim her choice, her mind, and her body within the limited space she has in Qfor7D. And no amount of \u201cthis princess just straight up walked out that place door and runs her own CHARITABLE BUSINESS FOLKS!!\u201d can remotely compare. \n\nIf a princess does THAT - then she should definitely be further along with actually using her brain for something. \n\nBut somehow we\u2019ve digressed and yet her face is # I speak out against da dudes YALL!!! \n\u2014 \n\nAlso your point about them struggling to have a protagonist was interesting. \n\nCan you clarify the third paragraph - so the drama SHOULD be written from her perspective so we naturally get her development because if we\u2019re in her mind then any development is naturally her development - or are you saying opposite. It is written from her perspective and it shouldn\u2019t be because it just needs to focus on him. \n\nHmmmmm. \n\nI\u2019ll have to think what perspective i feel it\u2019s from in general. She was soooo absent in this episode - I feel she can\u2019t be a real pov. When do you feel the drama has sidelined prioritizing the lawyer and missed an opportunity by telling story in different pov? \n\n\n\nLol. Seriously I need to get smacked for nonstop being like  \u201cokay but in Queen for seven daysssss\u201d haha \n\nBut your opinion concerning unclear protags and poorly designated pov in this just hit home for me because Qfor7Days I thought aced it on this account. \n\nMaybe this was just my experience watching it because I\u2019m a dunce. But somehow even though the title of the drama is \u201cqueen for 7 days\u201d which should make you totally beeline and focus on the queen as the protag\u2014 I felt the drama was so rich in characters and so even in giving them all their own space to speak and then complicating that with how others view them - it really only hit me and it was a TRAGIC HEART RIPPING CRASH- at the end of the show to realize \u201coh my gosh. This whole show. Was actually about a woman\u201d. And it feels so poetically epic that you have to sift through so many male personalities and BIG power politics to realize at the end that there is this little yet not so little woman in the middle of this who is holding so much weight disproportionately on her shoulders. \n\nLong way around to repeat what you said concisely - knowing how to play with pov and where to emphasize a protag adds that much much needed subtlety in depicting how subversively critical women have been in stories and situations that rarely gave them any space. And it exposes the lie of a lot of shorthand for the \u201cadmirable / liberated / cool\u201d women ; nothing more than mere pageantry and the very thing women are meant to be liberated from. \n\nThat skilled writing could supposedly even \u201cfocus\u201d on the male lawyer and write the woman as a subliminal character and actually end up revealing her as front and center /because/ of her position as secondary is where things get interesting and very beautiful.\n\n\nI\u2019d love to hear some of your thoughts about which dramas provide the successful \u201cstandard\u201d by which you are measuring and critiquing this one ;) I will stitch my mouth up now so I stop repeating which drama I\u2019m using as the standard for comparisons here hehe.",

Just last week she was out investigating and pulling strings all on her own; Myung Wol likely would not have participated as a witness without Yeon Ju's encouragement.\n\nAnd the show is clearly making an effort to highlight female side characters in most episodes so far to counteract all the usual politicking between old men which, I agree with OP, is great!",

Idk something about the scene feels eerie. Like i get it, its supposed to be a scene where the king gets a lil empowered to speak his wants, but the way he grinned gave me chills. His lines felt also very out odd even if we still consider the situation!&lt;\n- The pregnant lady, no wonder she looked familiar, she was the girl in Missing2. Girlie makes me cry in every show she\u2019s in.\n- Today, I found out that Tumblr Kpop boy representative L. Joe played the pregnant lady\u2019s husband. I really didnt recognize him until i saw some tweets earlier. \n- I had a feeling that &gt;!hansoo is observant enough to know all along that sowon is a princess, but all that was washed away by the last scene. Sowon\u2019s identity reveal wont be this sudden, so im guessing khs\u2019s last lines are mere red herrings and we\u2019ll find out the reason next week.\n- From the preview for ep 6, &gt;!i dont like how theyre implying that sowon\u2019s hidden identity is a form of betrayal to khs, and thus a story conflict.

I share your eagerness for the next episode! I am ADORING Joseon Attorney and absolutely loving all your comments, ideas, theses etc. Role on the next episode!",

Watching older dramas is great and has its own perks, but watching something live along with others is always good fun. So glad you get to do that with us for this one\u2014and for a really fun show too! Happy you're enjoying it as much as I am \ud83d\udc4f",

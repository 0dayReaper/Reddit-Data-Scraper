He is also the most interesting character.\n\nVan is the character who deviates most from the webtoon. I read some parts of the webtoon about 2 yrs ago. Van in the webtoon is basically a killing machine and he doesn't have much interaction with the rest of the characters. If there are any, they are either fighting or quarrelling. In fact, he detests any form of interaction with Miho and Yohan. \n\nSome webtoon readers even questioned whether Van is one of the main characters cos he hardly appears, esp in the second part of the webtoon. Whenever he appears, it is just to kill monsters. There is very limited character development for Van in the webtoon. I'm not sure what viewers expect when they talk about Van's character development.",

The way it\u2019s shot almost feels like I\u2019m huddled away on an island (lol), under the covers, watching the story unfold. \n\nIs the story somewhat simplistic in its premise of good, evil and the grey? Sure, but it\u2019s fun nonetheless even though they insist on being the only KDrama ever to kill that sunny, whimsical small town-y Jeju vibe with a cinematic yet broodish picturization. \n\nAlso, honestly, CEW is really holding his own in the show, given that all the other senior actors have a certain gravitas that they\u2019re bringing. He\u2019s so captivating and charming, and dare I say it has the character that seems most layered at present (purely because I find it so fascinating how &gt;!he\u2019s trying to reconcile his faith, with his purpose and reality and everything he\u2019s had to go through in his life until this point!&lt;). \n\nI appreciated the time spent in the first episode &gt;!going back to the origin of how it all came to be, helped set the tone and context for this second half of the show really well!&lt;. \n\nI still think Van is under-utilized as a character in that KNG does so much to convey his myriad emotions but if we were to boil it down all we\u2019ve got so far for him is that &gt;!he was taken away as a child, forced to become a half-human, half-demon, demon slayer\u2026tortured throughout but took his given mission seriously and was fascinated by Wonjeong and held onto the humanity that she saw in him. Beyond that perhaps the way time\u2019s been spent on Miho and Yohan and even Guntan in the first episode has made me feel like there\u2019s not been much else on offer for Van but it looks like in the source material too he\u2019s essentially just a killing machine, so perhaps with the \u201cdeviations\u201d they\u2019re looking to establish more for him through the remaining episodes?!&lt;. \n\nAlso this Yeomji girl has been styled perfectly to scream that she\u2019s evil and up to no good \ud83d\ude48\n\nP.S: Will our poor Yohan ever get to eat a decent meal because it looks like even &gt;!meal #2 is about to be rudely interrupted!&lt; \ud83d\ude02",

Van simply just turned twords her looking intently, he didn't utter a single word (wasn't given a single dialogues) yet it felt like he spoke all that he wanted to say, his eyes gave away so damm much, those eyes told me what I hadn't expected I would hear \n\nKim Nam Gil is reallyy good... I've watched his other works like The Shamless.. and Through The Darkness.. so I knew I wouldn't be dissapointed in the acting department from him\n\nAnd OMG yesss... finally someone who understands that Van has nuances that other chracters in this show (as of yet) are lacking.. it's is those nuances that make him so interesting (all thanks to Nam Gil's off course)",

It's okay, everyone learns and grows as they are exposed to dramas of different genres and forms of acting. \n\nKim Nam-gil is a chameleon and his acting range is so wide. Tbh, I wasn't impressed by his acting initially. But after watching a variety of dramas, I learn to appreciate different forms of acting esp subtle acting.",

He does such a good job of carrying the character and portraying the &gt;!torment of a man who killed his lover!&lt; and can't express feelings openly.",

I really like Eun Woo but I have a hard time seeing him as Johan for very long before he is just beautiful Eun Woo again. Still he is so nice to look at. Lol. \nNam Gil is totally awesome portraying Van\u2019s repressed emotions. He is why I am hooked on this show. \nIt\u2019s funny that Van and Goong tan  was supposed to void of human emotions when it\u2019s evident they both have a lot of emotions. Van\u2019s love for Wonjeong/Miho and Goong tan\u2019s passionate glee for killing and revenge. \nI think the show suffers from bad editing and/or just had an uneven script to begin with. Still I am hooked and it\u2019s going to be a long week to wait!",

ONCE AGAIN \n\nDo you have any understanding as to why he keeps doing that (it's has become a repetative pattern at this point) \nSome people at Twitter said that, because Granny in Ep 8(Ep 2 of pt2) told Van to not be close to Miho because of his energy.. that's the reason why he kept his hand away in Ep8  but if that's the case then what made him hesitate in the earlier 2 instances of S1 Ep 2 &amp; 4 (because during those earlier episodes he surely had gotten no info from Granny regarding his energy not being good for her)",

Lol. \nSpeaking of which, I was moved by the scene when Wonjeong  was dying  and Van was obviously feeling emotions he\u2019d never felt before- confusion and panic.

They even call Miho 'Van's woman''. The drama production probably took notice of this and included some semblance of a romance in the drama. No history of romance doesn't mean no potential for one in the future. Currently, it's at attraction stage. The perception of having chemistry is subjective and differs from person to person. Some may prefer Yohan and Miho as a couple.",

I think the dynamic that the 3 of them share is really great and works really well in contrast to what Wonjeong sort of longed for with Van and Gungtan. So those parallels really interest me, especially because it really feels like Yohan has some sort of supernatural powers that have either not been disclosed as yet or he is not aware of. And I think the pain and dilemma he is masking is something for example Van can relate to, whereas with Miho, Yohan is able to share an almost sibling dynamic which he was robbed of in Pt 1. Plus I generally love brooding + goofy dynamics\u2026so it\u2019s fun to watch!",

He loves her for sure I mean the eyes. ***What do you think about Van&amp;Miho/Wonjeong's relationship status in upcoming episodes?*** \n\n The way he looks at her is so emotional and it makes you want more and more. I won't take credit for it because even if I am not getting what I wanted, it was marked as action, fantasy, and horror there was no romance so in terms of that is perfect drama it's intense and exciting but since they teased us with those many angsty scenes between Van&amp;Miho is just so hard not to want them together I mean they have strong chemistry and Van just being like that makes me want them together even more. It's platonic from Miho I think he only sees him as a friend/family nothing more for now. Maybe in these 4 episodes there will be something that will be a turning point for them to upgrade from friends to lovers I know it's very unlikely but I still can imagine and wish for it. \n\nOverall I really, really like the premiere and I can't wait for the new episode this week.",

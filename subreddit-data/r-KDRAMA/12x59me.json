The show uses the sci-fi plot to explore philosophical questions about the nature of identity (what makes us who we are) and what obligations we have to each other societally.  \n\nIt\u2019s on the Cereal YouTube channel, I recommend it highly.",

I found him when I was 32 and even to this day I see it as a miracle. No, he's not perfect, neither am I but this is the most powerful thing that keeps us together - the knowledge that we would never leave each other.\n\nI don't know if there is a predestined fate but each to their own luck in life - whatever you do, never lose hope and never believe from the begining \"he's the one' because you need time for that. Try to connect with a lot of people and be realistic but don't take it to extremes - I have a friend like that who ended up with zero romantic experience because she was too reluctant to try, shied away from everything until it was really too late. \n\nI don't know about Beef, I'm watching The Real Has Come - and I'll tell you why : I give family dramas a wide berth for two big reasons - length, this is about 50 episodes, no time for all that - and boring family members discussions.\nHowever, I was pulled in by An Jae Hyun and the first episodes were gut wrenching for me watching him and knowing so much about his personal experience concerning marriage.\nNow, having watched the first 9 episodes, I've been reeled in completely - I like everything about it and, not only I don't find their discussions boring but everything about it is highly entertaining, the actors do exagerate in their reactions but...well...that's Koreans for you.\n\nI'm actually laughing while typing all this, the drama is such a good find after a period of watching almost exclusively Chinese, there is an episode on Sunday and one today (can't wait !) on Monday, per week, as we, in England, have to wait until it's broadcast in South Korea first.",

Funnily enough, I've also dropped **Tracer** (too serious and plodding for me) and think not so highly of **My Name** so clearly our tastes are not aligned.\n\nIt's always interesting to read these listicles to see how wildly personal tastes/preferences can differ even within the same genre. Like I think most people are aware that different people prefer different genres of kdramas but within a specific genre, it often seems that there is more pressure to achieve consensus on which dramas are the exemplars.\n\nThough I guess maybe due to kdramas mixing genres so often, it makes more sense to have a wide variety of personal preferences since our tastes for other sub-genres can make a huge difference.\n\n(I can probably also write a thesis on why **Reborn Rich** is not a true 'revenge' story but at least I agree with recommending the drama as a good drama.)",

It's great when people look at your personal taste in dramas and listen to what you are looking for. \n\nI just finished Unlock My Boss yesterday, which was actually my husband's pick. It was just okay in my book. So many plot holes, which tends to be true of Sci-fi/fantasy dramas in general but this one was particularly bad. But there was a little twist at the end &gt;!when the evil chairwoman is duped into thinking she is going to the helioport and instead she ends up at the police station!&lt; which was fun.",

Ahn Jae-hyun is wonderful as always, and having Jung Hae-in play his sidekick and Ji Jin-hee the primary antagonist is just a great setup! A story about a vampire surgeon! And greatest oily villain character actor of all time, Jo Jae-yoon (from **Descendants of the Sun** and **Alchemy of Souls**, among many others).\n\nBut I cannot get past how much I really really dislike the FL, Yoo Ri-ta (Ku Hye-sun). We're told she's a good surgeon, but in the episodes I've watched, she's insufferably unprofessional, and given that her uncle (Kim Kap-soo) is the hospital director, she just comes across like the worst nepo baby. \n\nI want to keep watching but I can't enjoy a single moment when Yoo Ri-ta is on the screen. So I have two questions:  if I keep watching **Blood**, will it be worth it to put up with Yoo Ri-ta? And are there *any* roles for Ku Hye-sun where her character isn't insufferable? I've only seen her in **Boys Over Flowers** prior to this, and I was careful not to judge her here because of how meh I found BOF, but I'm just not up to it.",

To be honest, I am really looking forward to the angst (&gt;!hope that they will not change much of the plot!&lt;)... \n\nI know they are the second lead but still, their scenes together are less then what I thought. This is really not enough for the build up of their relations, so that I doubt whether the scenes on the remaining 6 episodes between HongSi can have enough tension. Because in the novel, &gt;!it really written very sadly and I really love their story:\u2019)!&lt;",

But my heart breaks to know that for the throne le seol stayed in hiding his entire life but he doesn't get it in the end. Kinda like nokdu, it's ending is still heart wrenching for me, the reason i don't like dramas with real characters. But this one doesn't have real characters. Might the writers change the story, idk. I would personally like the watchman to die. I just cannot imagine how danoh's sister accepts him after knowing what he did even without his own will. One character has to has a sad ending to make it a little realistic. Even if watchman has to have a happy ending, he can be san's closest palace guard or just leave hanyang to live his life his own way with danoh's sister. I would have liked the prince brothers to live in the same palace with queen dogawar like a family with dan oh being the queen. There was also a point where i felt yooha would die because of him taking over a fake identity. Whyyy just why the only happy ending san is getting is with danoh. I want all his hardwork to pay off what he did all his life to gain his real position as the king. Now it's all a waste. He looses his track and purpose of his life for his love wow haha. Yooha is okay for the king's position as he is a scholar and all but still when the whole stroy's purpose was to make san the king, i don't think it's a happy ending. It's just an ending people wanted so that everybody gets their love. I really hope writers change this ending.!&lt;",

Being the shrewd woman that she is, she probably will start planning against Lord Sin in case he betrays Yooha.!&lt;\n\nWhat I am looking forward to is &gt;!the King learning that his new bodyguard is the nephew who has been consuming his thoughts endlessly. He even told San that Seol will be about his age!!&lt;\n\nThe &gt;!order to put Shiyeol's own safety over San's just gives me a bad feeling. I'm not optimistic about Shiyeol's survival.

You're being kind of obvious.!&lt;\n\nIt seems like the plot moved a lot this ep. ShiYeol &gt;!didn't seem to recognise the name on the tombstone, or did he not get a proper look at it? Yooha and San both found out each other's true identities. Don't be pointing swords at each other like that, it'll make your father sad. I guess it's about time for the Gyeom-Seol conflict, over Danoh and the throne. \"There cannot be two suns in the sky\" is the foreshadowing of foreshadowings.!&lt; The &gt;!pecks this ep are much cuter! I see more chemistry between the actors. Though like ShiYeol, I also felt nauseous at the inn scene. \ud83d\ude02!&lt;\n\nNow now &gt;!Hongjoo, I think that ornament is going to lead Administrator Jang to you.

He found out he's the illegitimate son of the Crown Prince (who was killed by the current king), so he does have royal blood but would have no claim to the thrown because Lee San is the legitame heir to the thrown. The government official dude is backing him and wanted him to take the thrown under the name Lee San because he can't find the real Lee San, and frankly, he doesn't care which one of them takes the thrown, he just wants to get rid of the current tyrannical king. Yuha reluctantly agreed to assume Lee Sans identity as he's willing to take the risk to be a part of the cause for a better world. I think Yuha has figured out who Lee San is, but only after he agreed to take his identity, and he's in too deep now to back out.",

However, those saying ML kissed FL without consent, let's not forget that FL kissed him first without consent.  I think she backed away from the kiss at first because it literally came out of nowhere, but when he went in for the 2nd kiss, she didn't back away and was participating, so...!&lt; \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nOverall, episode 11 was ok, but it's starting to drag, and we need to see some action.

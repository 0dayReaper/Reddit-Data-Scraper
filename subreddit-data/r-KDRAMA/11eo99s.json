    "postText": "I came across this older post that asked about what actors you would want to diversify roles [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/l21w0u/who_is_an_actor_youd_like_to_see_in_more_diverse/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\nIts so cool that alot of the actors mentioned really end up doing some of the exact roles that those that posted suggested.\n\nFor example Shin Ye Eun moved on from being the brokenhearted girl and gave us two stellar performances as Ok Chan Mi (Revenge of Others) and young Park Yeon Jin (The Glory). Song Hye Ko also FINALLY moved on from her Melodrama rut and has given us The Glory. Same could be said about Jung Hae In whose given us DP and Snowdrop where he plays a more darker character. I love that for him cause I'm such a fan and the melodramas were fully killing me. \n\nAre there any other actors that made some really great professional progression in recent years that you can think of? Or are there those that you still think need to diversify their collection? Also, are there any actors that you think already have a body of work that has amazing range?\n\n**when I say actors I mean actors and actresses",

Choi Wooshik and In Haejin are also excellent. They\u2019re all Im Siwan\u2019s contemporaries, but their performances and Im Siwan\u2019s are poles apart. \n\nI agree, yes, his overal portrayal of an introverted librarian was as I said fine - it\u2019s not bad, but imv was not strong and nuanced at emoting, it\u2019s just alright. It\u2019s a burger and fries meal, not steak. It does the job, but you\u2019re not mesmerised and thinking about it an hour later. He wore a dopey, aloof facial expression for the most part in SS. I think he expressed joy really well, but negative emotions didn\u2019t quite land.\n\nSomeone said Misaeng was his most well received series in Korea, so I\u2019ll keep an open mind and give that a go too especially as it\u2019s a different type of character role.",

A lot of viewers who watched **Her Private Life** had no idea he was Hot Waffle Guy from **Coffee Prince** or the &gt;!terrifying psychopathic serial killer!&lt; from **Voice**. He got to show off his impressive comedic acting chops and physical comedy skills in **Crazy Love** and was very compelling (and hot) as a tortured exorcist priest in **The Guest**.\n\nHe\u2019s always said he\u2019s more interested in taking on projects that challenge and fulfill him as opposed to those that bring him money and fame. He received lots of ML offers after **Coffee Prince** but he thought he was too inexperienced at the time and since then, he\u2019s turned down many lead roles in favor of supporting roles that he found more interesting and were significantly different from his previous characters.\n\nHis first role after **Coffee Prince** was a gay p\u00e2tissier in [**Antique Bakery**](https://youtu.be/bu48IWvArPE), a 2008 movie also starring Ju Ji-hoon and Yoo Ah-in. And despite the inevitable gay rumors, three years later he took on the role of [Hedwig](https://youtu.be/SfYWBaHsuLk) in a stage version of [**Hedwig and the Angry Inch**](https://youtu.be/jX72_BGnP0I). To prep for the role, he even spent a month working in full drag at a transgender bar in Itaewon.\n\nHe tends to gravitate toward indie films, Japanese projects (he grew up in Tokyo), theatre, and making [music](https://youtu.be/NaY09rrdFtE) with his [indie rock band Walrus](https://youtu.be/CrmV8FeFpbI), which is why we haven\u2019t seen him in that many dramas. I\u2019m really looking forward to his next project but in the meantime, fingers crossed he confirms his guest role in [**Death\u2019s Game**](https://twitter.com/ingukkies/status/1628636515474497537?s=46&amp;t=oYE1WrYV1W3i-_yc-6i_mA).",

He takes risks that don\u2019t always work (Silent Sea) but he clearly prioritises creativity over sure hits. \n\nI just wish he would do more regular projects but he is known for being picky, even with endorsements. I keep waiting for the movie WONDERLAND which has some big names including Tang Wei, Park Bo Gum, and Bae Suzy. They started filiming in 2020, that is a long wait.\n\nI think his female counterpart is BAE DOONA. Love her!",

But looking at his previous dramas I realised - this is what Lee Junho is. His mind, preferences and interests are all over the place in a good way. So naturally he will go in almost opposite direction with every new project. I am confident that his new character in King The Land will be interesting and different in some way to what we are used to in chaebol dramas. And I am already excited for his next project after KTL. \n\n(And don't get me started on how I am excited to see what he comes up with for his next solo album when it comes out. It's unfair to be this talented at so many things.)",

            "comment": "**Lee Dong Wook** really does it all. Strangers From Hell, Bad and Crazy, Touch Your Heart .. couldn't be more different. I remember an interview he did around the Goblin era where he said it's a personal goal not to be boxed into one type-casted kind of role (I think it's why it took him awhile to do another supernatural folklore romance drama) so I think it's a definite choice to take on a big variety of projects. \n\nGonna add in his repeat co-star, the underrated **Lee Kyu Hyung**. From Loony in Prison Playbook, to playing a very believable paraplegic in Life, to his role in Stranger .. All of Us Are Dead, Happiness, Hi Bye Mama .. he is the definition of an actor with range imo.\n\n**Lee Junho** is an obvious choice and already mentioned, but I think **Taecyeon** has also been showing a lot of range, especially with his last few projects. \n\nI'm excited for **Seo Kangjoon**'s return and to see how he expands his portfolio. Man literally showed us how diverse his acting could be in one drama (Are You Human Too?). The fact that he played 2 characters, but you could tell which was which just by the tiniest changes in expression .. it was really impressive.\n\nI'm giving early predictions that **Lee Do Hyun** is on his way to making this list. I don't think he's quite there yet (I think there's a lot of character overlap in 18 Again/Youth of May/Hotel De Luna), but with The Glory p2, The Good Bad Mother and Pamyo coming out this year I think he's making an effort to show other sides of his acting. Rewatching Sweet Home after I became a fan of his, I was surprised by how almost unrecognizable he was in that role.",

Also love his controlled expressions in high intensity scenes in CCIR.",

Hair and makeup contributed, but had I not looked at the cast (aka searched for PJH dramas after his outstanding performance in **WHC1**), I probably would not have known it was the same person. He was _that_ different. I\u2019ve only watched 2 of his dramas, but I\u2019m looking forward to more of his works!\n\n**Kim Go-eun** also has an amazing range in acting. I most recently saw her in **Little Women** (absolutely amazing), where she was so different from her characters in **The King: Eternal Monarch**, **Yumi\u2019s Cells**, **Goblin**, **Cheese in the Trap**.

Some just act to continue making a living, while some don't have the privilege to be picky with their roles.",

They both straddle film and drama, and seem gung-ho on checking off every genre out there - melo, action, thriller, romance, sci-fi. None of their roles or works are similar to the preceding role or work.\n\nIdeally, it's better to try out different things at the start so you don't get pigeonholed. Diversifying gives you more flexibility and longevity.",

Just right now in his current drama he's playing such a demanding triple role, he's amazing and I wish his star rises again.\n\nI fell in love with Jung So Min even more during Alchemy of Souls. You could really see the talent in her earlier roles but because of her triple role in AoS her K-Arts pedigree really became apparent.\n\nGo Kyung Pyo is also someone who really tries to branch out. He started his career in comedy, played an umchina in Reply 1988, a stuffy chaebol in Jealousy Incarnate and Love In Contract, a psycho in Connect, and loads of other various diverse roles in movies. \n\nI want to see Han Hyo Joo, Han Ji Min and Gong Hyo Jin bring the range they show in movies to the small screen. \n\nI hope to see Won Jin Ah in a more challenging role other than the petite mid level office worker girl next door she often plays. She got her start in movies so that means she has talent. All she needs to do is flaunt it.\n\nI wish Lee Yi Kyung could appear in more dramatic roles. I know his cash cow is his comedy but I saw him in a small role as a bad guy on My Love From The Star and he was terrifyingly good.\n\nLee Jong Suk and Kim Woo Bin for me also need to diversify because they both have talent but they seem to pick the same roles over and over again.",

I didn't even realize it was him in Kairos lol. \n\nTalking about Kairos, **shin sung rok** is fantastic and I hope he takes more ML roles. He did too many villains.\n\n**shin hye sun** has range. Mr queen, stranger, even her minor roles in lotbs and oh my ghost are very different.\n\n**Kim Jung hyun** is showing all his range in a single drama lol by acting three different roles very smoothly. His roles in Welcome to Waikiki, Mr queen, cloy are also very different. I enjoyed his role as kokdu, though his acting did remind me of a mix from wtw and cloy, it still hit different. Hope to see him play a cranky psychopathic role/villain next.\n\n~~Strangely, as much as I enjoy his acting, I don't find **Jo Jung suk** diverse, his acting felt similar in hp, jealousy incarnate and oh my ghost. He is an amazing musical actor, hope he picks different roles next.~~ Edit: apparently, I haven't watched all his works. \n\n**Lee kyu hyung** is absolutely fantastic and has stand out roles in different drama - prison playbook, stranger, life. Just give this man a lead role. He will absolutely slay it. \n\nThese are all I can think of right now. Will probably add more later.",

He is one of the actors who has improved the most throughout his career.\n\nAnd the list could go on, there are so many good actors it's hard to list everybody.",

Character from **Welcome to Waikiki 2** is a far cry from **Start-up** character, even character in **Strongest Deliveryman** changed considerably over the course of the series showing his range. Although his recent work - the movie **The Childe** has not been released, seems to be likely to be a far cry from the characters he has portrayed in tv series.",

I'd never heard of him until I watched **Vincenzo**, following which I watched **Descendants of the Sun**, **Space Sweepers**, and **Penny Pinchers** back-to-back, and it wasn't even a little bit jarring. All wildly different characters, genres, and stories, and he pulls them off perfectly. The guy BECOMES his characters.\n\nI remember seeing a post on Tumblr that compared three still cuts of Vincenzo, Yoon Hyunwoo, and Jin Dojun. All three were literally just photos of Song Joongki wearing a suit, but you can still tell exactly who's who from their demeanors alone.\n\nHe's said in interviews that he tries to never play the same role twice, and it really shows. Massive respect for a guy who's willing to take artistic risks instead of playing it safe and typecasting himself. Now he's got three films lined up and I'm sure we'll see just as much versatility out of those.",

It\u2019s her first time playing an antagonist role. There is no significant male lead, it\u2019s a role that is about 95% focused on just her character. It\u2019s a much more complex character who commits identity fraud and lies to climb the social ladder. I highly recommend people to check it out! It was very well received in Korea and she recently won a best actress award for it!",

A mother who lost her child in HEESOO and the horror that happens after she decides to communicate through VR. \n\nA phsychotic adulteress who was having an affair with her friend\u2019s husband in Show Window.\n\nA naive cleaner who becomes a spy to get information on insider trading in CLEANING UP.\n\nAnd a supporting role in 2037 where she played one of the prisoners who strive to give a young girl hope after she was sentenced to prison.\n\nAnd just to add; she played all these roles while been a major cast member of two popular variety shows. Her acting skills are top notch ; it\u2019s just natural and doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s acting. She beat 1,000 actresses for the audition of her first major lead role.\n\nShe\u2019s definitely one of the most underrated actresses in my opinion. And this is without including her other versatile skills e.g she\u2019s also a good writer and author.",

Also, the people here on Reddit believe in the \"great reset theory\" and subscribe to the idea that overpopulation is causing climate change. \n\nThis is why they will down-vote pro-human comments like mine. I think having children is an amazing thing!\n\nThere is an article on the internet called \"Eight Billion People in the World Is a Crisis, Not an Achievement\". As one of those eight billion, I am deeply offended.",

Just like in other dramas, the historical,  cultural, and political references in \u201cMr. Queen\u201d are well known to the  Korean viewers. On the other hand, we, the international viewers, must  dig deep into Wikipedia and other sources (or post questions in forums  like this) so that we can understand what\u2019s going on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor  example, some people who have seen \u201cMr. Queen\u201d said that they couldn\u2019t  stand the court politics or the infighting between the different  factions because the drama didn\u2019t provide any context. Well, the court  politics and the infighting between the different factions happened  between the Andong Kim and Poonyang Jo clans, which are well known to  Korean viewers and thus, no context was necessary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen  \u201cSaimdang\u201d was first broadcast in 2017, I joined the on-air discussions  of the drama in the Soompi Forums. In that forum, whenever I had  questions about the drama, I had two go-to persons: for questions about  Korean language, culture, and history, I asked \u201cgerrytan8063\u201d; whenever I  had questions about Chinese characters used in the drama, I asked  \u201cliddi.\u201d I haven\u2019t joined the Soompi discussions after I found reddit,  and so I don\u2019t know if \u201cgerrytan8063\u201d and \u201cliddi\u201d are still active  there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Where  can we turn to when we, as international viewers, have questions about  Korean language, culture, and history as they relate to K-dramas?**  There\u2019s Quora, of course; \u201cbodashiri\u201d in Tumblr has a form in his  website where he/she says, \u201cAsk me anything.\u201d Also, since 2012, the  \u201cAnnals of the Joseon Dynasty\u201d is being translated in English, with the  project supposed to be finished in 2034. Certain portions of the English  translation are available online, as you can read in \u201cGlobalization of  Korean history\u201d from the official Korean government history website.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh,  maybe we can also use ChatGPT in learning about the historical,  cultural, and language issues that we come across in K-dramas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe  very first K-drama that I watched in full was the 2014 blockbuster \u201cMy  Love From The Star\u201d starring Jun Ji-hyun and Kim Soo-hyun. In this  drama, I first heard the term \u201cJoseon Dynasty\u201d and learned how the  dynasty heavily influenced what Korea is today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore  \u201cMy Love From The Star\u201d however, I had seen one or two brief scenes  from the 2003 blockbuster drama \u201cA Jewel in the Palace\u201d (aka \u201cDae Jang  Geum\u201d) starring Lee Young-ae. Sometime in 2005 or 2006, \u201cA Jewel in the  Palace\u201d began sweeping the Philippines. Every night at around 6 o\u2019clock,  the streets would become empty, with people shouting to each other as  they rush to their homes, \u201cJang Geum na!\u201d (in English, \u201cIt\u2019s Jang Geum  time!\u201d). Since that time, \u201cA Jewel in the Palace\u201d has been broadcast in  the Philippines five times; that\u2019s how popular it is among Filipinos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI  watched \u201cA Jewel in the Palace\u201d in its entirety only in 2015. Since  then, I\u2019ve seen each episode around four or five times already; whenever  I feel depressed, I rewatch Ep. 6 where Jang Geum was &gt;!exiled to the herb garden outside the palace!&lt;.  Needless to say, Lee Young-ae is the love of my life. Next to Lee  Young-ae, I love Han Hyo-joo (\u201cDong Yi\u201d), Han Hye-jin (\u201cJumong\u201d), Han  Ga-in (\u201cThe Moon That Embraces The Sun\u201d), Moon Chae-won (\u201cThe Princess\u2019s  Man\u201d), Park Shin Hye (\u201cThe Royal Tailor\u201d), Shin Se-kyung (\u201cSix Flying  Dragons\u201d), Park Ha-sun (Queen In-hyun in \u201cDong Yi\u201d), Nana (\u201cInto The  Ring\u201d), and Go Ara (\u201cThe Joseon Magician\u201d), in that order.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A. The historical figures who were fictionalized in this drama**;  lawsuit filed by descendants of a historical figure against \u201cThe  Princess\u2019s Man\u201d (Soompi); the rivalry between the Andong Kim and Poonyang Jo  clans and \u201csedo politics\u201d (royal in-law politics)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe  main characters in \u201cMr. Queen\u201d are So-yong (Queen Cheorin), played by  Shin Hye-sun, and King Cheoljong, played by Kim Jung-hyun. Some of the  secondary characters are Queen Sunwon (Grand Queen Dowager) of the  Andong Kim clan and Queen Shinjeong (Queen Dowager) of the Poongyang Jo  clan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cMr.  Queen\u201d is fictional, with the following genres: historical, comedy,  time travel, and body swap. But its characters and background events are  inspired by historical figures and events. For example, the lead  character (King Cheoljong) and his background facts \u2014 growing up  destitute on Ganghwa Island, puppet of the Andong Kim clan, relatives  persecuted as Catholics, etc. \u2014 are all based on history. Also, the  conflict between the Andong Kim clan and Poonyang Jo clan is historical.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKing  Cheoljong in \u201cMr. Queen\u201d is a highly fictionalized character that\u2019s  different from the historical King Cheoljong. The drama portrays him to  be &gt;!secretly  plotting to establish himself as a strong ruler against two warring  political factions \u2014 the Andong Kim clan (led by Grand Dowager Queen  Sunwon) and the Pungyang Jo clan (led by Dowager Queen Sinjeong)!&lt;.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A-1. Historical figures who were fictionalized in \u201cMr. Queen\u201d:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(1)** [King Cheoljong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheoljong_of_Joseon)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The  25th king of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea (25 July 1831 \u2013 16 January  1864), he was a second cousin to the heirless Heonjong of Joseon, as  well as a great-great grandson of Yeongjo of Joseon. He was chosen to  become King by Senior Dowager Queen Sunwon (King Sunjo\u2019s widow) and the  powerful Andong Kim clan because he was illiterate and thus easy to  manipulate.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nCheoljong ascended to  the throne in 1849 at the age of 19 after King Heonjong died without an  heir. As a distant relative of both the recently deceased king as well  as a descendant of King Yeongjo, Cheoljong was selected for adoption by  the Senior Dowager Queen Sunwon (King Sunjo\u2019s widow) at the time and to  allow him to ascend to the throne. The future Cheoljong was found on  Ganghwa Island where his family had been in exile since the Catholic  Persecution of 1801.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nWhen the  envoys (dispatched in order to seek for the future king) arrived on  Ganghwa Island, they found the exiled remnants of the royal clan barely  surviving in wretched poverty, and in the midst of that degradation,  19-year old Yi Won-beom was proclaimed King. Though from the start of  the Joseon Dynasty Korean kings had given top priority to the education  of their sons, Cheoljong could not even read a single word on the notice  delivering congratulations to him on his elevation to the royal throne.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nAs  part of the Andong Kim\u2019s manipulation of Cheoljong, in 1851, the clan  married Cheoljong to Kim Mun-geun\u2019s daughter, known posthumously as  Queen Cheor\u2019in.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nCheoljong died at  the age of 32 in 16 January 1864 (by suspected foul play by the Andong  Kim clan, the same clan which made him king), without any surviving male  heirs. Once again, it became necessary to search far back in the Yi  lineage to find a candidate for the throne.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The only surviving \\[cropped\\] image of King Cheoljong](https://preview.redd.it/lwyvj4tuu2pa1.jpg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e43d2a1053cb9e1bb2f29d5195fc542ddf7c1943)\n\n**(2) Queen Cheorin**: wife of King Cheoljong, also known as Queen Dowager Myeongsun (27 April 1837 \u2013 12 June 1878).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQueen Cheorin belonged to the Andong Kim clan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(3) Grand Dowager Queen: Queen Sunwon**  (8 June 1789 \u2013 21 September 1857), also known as Queen Dowager  Myeonggyeong, was the spouse of Sunjo of Joseon. She served as regent of  Korea from 1834\u20131841 and from 1849\u20131852.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(4) Queen Dowager: Queen Shinjeong**,  also known as Queen Dowager Hyoyu, (21 January 1809 - 4 June 1890) was  the only wife of Crown Prince Hyomyeong of Joseon and mother of King  Heonjong of Joseon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQueen Shinjeong belonged to the Poonyang Jo clan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A-2.** \u201cMr. Queen\u201d was criticized for distorting history. Among the things that was criticized is the drama\u2019s portrayal of the Queen Dowager (Queen Shinjeong in history) as being &gt;!heavily involved in shamanism!&lt;.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom \u201cDescendants of Sin Sook-joo sue The Princess\u2019 Man\u201d (Soompi):  \u201cAccording to the Seoul District Court, 108 descendants of old Sin  claimed a damage suit of KRW 3 billion \\[2.2 million US dollars\\] against  the broadcasting company and the writer for negatively distorting the  image of their ancestor Sin Sook-joo from the Chosun era.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis lawsuit was filed in 2011; I couldn\u2019t find any information about what happened to this lawsuit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A-3: Andong Kim clan, Poongyang Jo clan, and \u201csedo politics\u201d (royal in-law politics)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom New World Encyclopedia:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;At  the beginning of the 19th century, the Andong Kim clan, who had  provided the Joseon state with several queens, had seized power almost  everywhere in Korea. The social stagnation that resulted was a breeding  ground for unrest. Corruption and embezzlement from the treasury and its  inevitable exploitation were taken to extreme levels, and reached  staggering proportions. One rebellion after another was accompanied by  natural disasters.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nThe only aim of  the Andong Kim clan was the preservation of their influence. Their  fierce campaign to dominate the royal house had led to a situation in  which almost all of the representatives of the royal family fled from  Seoul. When the royal family produced intelligent and appropriate  candidates for the accession, they were either accused of treason and  executed or sent into exile, so when Heonjong died, leaving no son, no  acceptable candidate could be found to succeed to the throne.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom \u201cExactly how much power did the Andong Kim Clan have in the Joseon court? How did they attain such power?\u201d (Quora, by Michael L. Best) :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cHow  did the Andong Kim clan attain power? By intermarrying with the royal  family, enthroning young and easy to control men as king, purging  political rivals, and, very likely, killing off any king when they begin  to threaten their power.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n\u201cAfter  Queen Jeongsun stepped down \\[in 1805 as regent of King Sunjo\\], Queen  Sunwon\u2019s father, Kim Jo-soon, began to make his move. Kim Jo-soon, who  at that time was already of high rank within the royal court, began to  purge all his political rivals to help secure the position of his family  and political faction. At the same time corruption in the civil service  examination increased, likely in the form of bribes to the Kim clan.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe  term \u201csedo politics\u201d (royal in-law politics) describes the period 1800  to 1863 when national politics in Joseon was exclusively led by a few  powerful royal in-law families, most notably the Andong Kim and  Poongyang Jo clans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom[\u201cCollusive Oligopolistic Politics: Sedo and the Political Structure of Early-Nineteenth-Century Choson Korea\u201d](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0073361) by Tae Yeon Eom (2012 thesis, University of British Columbia):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;In  contemporary Korean historiography, the reign periods of King Sunjo (r.  1800-1834), King H\u014fnjong (r.1834-1849), and King Ch\u2019\u014flchong (r.  1849-1863) are generally called \u201cThe Era of Sedo Politics\u201d in Chos\u014fn  Korea (1392-1910). In contemporary Korean historiography, the political  theme of sedo predominated after the death of King Ch\u014fngjo (r.  1776-1800), when national politics was exclusively led by a few powerful  royal in-law families, most notably the Andong Kim and P\u2019ungyang Cho  clans, for sixty-three years. Obviously, those two major clans enjoyed  extensive political authority and high social status in the nineteenth  century.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notes:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(1)**  Queen Shinjeong was portrayed by Chae Soo-bin in the 2016 hit  \u201cMoonlight Drawn By Clouds\u201d aka \u201cLove in The Moonlight.\" Queen  Shinjeong\u2019s husband Crown Prince Hyomyeong (King Munjo) was portrayed by  Park Bo-gum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(2)** In Season 2 , Ep. 4 of \u201cKingdom,\u201d Crown Prince Lee Chang &gt;!visited in Ganghwa Island his  distant relative Prince Noseong, an impoverished member of the royal  family. The drama portrays Prince Noseong as a lowly fisherman but who\u2019s  a well-read man!&lt;. This character was probably based on King Cheoljong (1831-1864), the last puppet king of the Andong Kim clan. &gt;!Unlike the drama, however,!&lt; in history, King Cheoljong was illiterate, which made it easy for him to be controlled by the Andong Kim clan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\u201cKingdom\u201d Season 2, Ep. 4](https://preview.redd.it/72tbkc38y2pa1.jpg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4dd491c2125d306f097a9e2e0ec228a483fc99b8)\n\n**B.

These seokbinggo, literally \u201cstone ice storage,\u201d were located  around the country. Local governments sometimes delivered ice to  palaces, but mostly used ice as a means to prevent special local  products from spoiling on the way to a palace.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom \u201cFeeling the heat: The luxury of ice\u201d in Joseon (Korea Times) by Robert Neff:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The  Korean government maintained two large ice storage facilities at  Seobinggo and Dongbingo, where huge slabs of river ice (nearly two  meters long and about 12.5 centimeters thick) were covered with straw  and preserved throughout the year. Court officials and others who  possessed \u201cbingpae\u201d \u2015 an ice ration card \u2015 were regularly able to obtain  a certain amount of this valuable commodity (based on their rank) for  their own use.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nThe common people,  however, had to either purchase ice on the black market or from ice  merchants. The black market ice \u2015 obtained illegally from one of the  government ice storage facilities \u2015 was probably considered to be safer  but much more difficult to obtain and so most people had to rely on  local ice vendors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notes:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(1)** [\u201cThe Grand Heist\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5oZfiHFiYZ4)  is a 2012 South Korean historical comedy film about a gang of 11  thieves who try to steal ice blocks from the royal storage, Seobingo,  during the last years of the Joseon era.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(2)**  In Ep. 9 of \u201cA Jewel in the Palace,\u201d crisis hits as &gt;!Lady Han falls sick!&lt;  and Jang Geum, with Keum Young, is left to prepare the food for the  king and his entourage in the royal hunt.

A swordsman  also does this after slashing an enemy; blood may also cause the sword  to become rusty.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n**(b)**  The bodyguard sheaths his sword into the scabbard with the bladed side  up. Why? Two reasons. One, if the bladed edge is sheathed with the  bladed edge down, gravity will pull the blade down into the scabbard,  causing the blade to become dull. Two, it seems that when a sword is  sheathed with the blade up, it\u2019s easier to unsheathe the sword and  quickly attack an enemy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(4)** In Ep. 7 of Mr. Sunshine, Ae-shin and her servant Haman enjoy \u201cpatbingsu\u201d (\u201cbingsu\u201d) in the French bakery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**F.

The Donghak movement  arose as a reaction to seohak (\u201cWestern learning\u201d), and called for a  return to the \u201cWay of Heaven.\u201d While Donghak originated as a reform  movement and revival of Confucian teachings, it gradually evolved into a  religion known today as \u201cCheondoism\u201d in Korea under the third  patriarch.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nChoe was alarmed by the  intrusion of Christianity (Catholicism), and the Anglo-French  occupation of Beijing. He believed that the best way to counter foreign  influence in Korea was to introduce democracy, establish human rights  and create a paradise on Earth independent of foreign interference.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nIn  1892 the small groups of the Donghak movement were united into a single  Peasant Guerrilla Army or Donghak Peasants\u2019 Army. The peasants worked  in the fields during the day, but during the night, they armed  themselves and raided government offices and killed rich landlords,  traders, and foreigners. They confiscated their victims\u2019 properties for  redistribution.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nChoe Je-u was  executed as a criminal by the government.

Then, without even going to his own house, he must set out for  his destination, the government providing his expenses. He bears the  seal of his commission, a silver plate having the figure of a horse  engraved on it. In some cases he has the power of life and death in his  hands.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n\u201cYet, even the Messenger of  the Dark Path is not free from espionage, for after him forthwith  follows his \u2018double\u2019 the yashi or Night Messenger, who reports on the  conduct of the royal inspector and also on the affairs of each province  through which he passes. The whereabouts of these emissaries are rarely  discoverable by the people, as they travel in strict disguise, and  unknown.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n\u201cThis system corresponds  almost exactly to that of the ometsuke (eye-appliers), for many  centuries in use in Japan, but abolished by the Mikado\u2019s government at  the revolution of 1868. It was by means of these E-sa or spies that many  of the Corean Christians of rank were marked for destruction.

A lot of the time evil characters seem to use it, but not always.\n\nThe only K-historical drama I've watched that prominently featured shamanism is the 2012 blockbuster \"The Moon That Embraces The Sun\" (TMTETS) starring starring Kim Soo-hyun, Han Ga-in, Jung Il-woo, and Kim Min-seo. MV at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qXi2hhfXn6w\n\nThe FL and a secondary character in TMTETS are shamans in Seongsucheong, the official government bureau that's in charge of the palace's shamanistic rituals.\n\nThe writer of TMTETS also wrote \"Chicago Typewriter,\" where there's a minor character who's a shaman.\n\n\"Hotel Del Luna\" also has shamanistic elements.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n(1) \u201cThe end of a life: Concepts of afterlife\u201d from Jeju Weekly\n\n&gt;A Shamanic tradition commonly called Mu (often termed \u201cMusok\u201d by scholars) is widely believed to be the original religious system of both the Korean peninsula and Jeju, though it takes a different form in each. The worship of Sanshin, mountain spirits, may precede even Mu, according to Professor David Mason of Kyunghee University, though this remains unconfirmed. \n\n(2) \u201cSpirituality and the\nAfterlife in Korea: A brief\noverview of spiritual customs in historic Korea\u201d\n\n&gt;Korea\u2019s religious history is one of change and cooperation. Faiths like Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Christianity have all left their mark on the nation. None have enjoyed the influence and longevity of\nKorean shamanism, or Muism. Noted in villages from ancient times, Muism gave and took from each religion it encountered. It survived every Korean dynasty for 4,000 years or more and is still practiced by millions today.\n\n(3) \"Saranghae, Spirits: The Shaman in K-drama and Popular Culture\"\n\n&gt;The elaborate and oftentimes chaotic ceremony we see depicted in many Korean shows and movies is the kut, and it is the most exhausting ritual a mudang is asked to perform. It does not follow a specific sequence; instead, it is improvised to suit the specific needs of the client. In a kut, the mudang wears the god\u2019s costume and invokes the necessary spirits and ancestor gods in order to divine visions and come up with answers.\n\nThis article mentions some K-dramas that depict shamanism, such as \"Sell Your Haunted House\" (2021), \"The Possessed\" (2020), \"The Guest\" (2018), and \"The Great Shaman Ga Doo-shim.\"\n\nP.S.\n\nIf I remember correctly, there's some mention of shamanism in \"Start-Up.\" Also, the 2022 drama \"Cafe Minamdang\" (which I haven't watched) also features shamanism.",

I thought they were so odd and now I find them so attractive. But why? Were they for shade? \n\n**Brief answer: The wider the hat's brim, the higher the social status.**\n\nFrom \u201cHats offer glimpse of Joseon culture\u201d (Korea Times) at http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2010/07/148_65774.html\n\n&gt;The late Joseon Kingdom (1392-1910) was called the \u201cNation of Hats\u201d by foreigners. American astronomer and author Percival Lowell (1855-1916), who visited the Joseon Kingdom, particularly noted that its hats were the most impressive among others for their diversity, originality and practicality in his book \u201cChoson (Joseon), the Land of the Morning Calm\u201d in 1885.\n&gt;\n&gt;The hats served a variety of purposes \u2015 protection from cold and heat, decoration and fashion and a means to represent social status and formality.\n\nFrom \u201cBreaking down the hats and hairstyles of \u2018Kingdom\u2019: The hit Netflix series has viewers curious about Joseon-era accessories\u201d (Korea JoonGang Daily) at http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3059581\n\n&gt;From commoners to noble scholars, nearly all men of the Joseon era wore hats.\n&gt;\n&gt;According to \u201cJoseon Era Hat Dictionary\u201d author Yang Jin-sook, a professor in the department of textile design at Hanyang University, these hats were not usually worn for practical reasons, such as protecting someone from the sun. Instead, they reflected Confucian values \u2014 formality, authority and dignity \u2014 which was the foundations of politics at the time.\n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cFrom a philosophical perspective, people at the time considered their hair to be equivalent to the mountains and the sky. Mountains were considered \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018honorable\u2019 so wearing a hat was like having this honor bestowed upon their heads. From a practical perspective, hats were meant to show one\u2019s social class. Just by looking at the hats, people could distinguish whether a person was a girl or a boy, or a high-class scholar or a commoner who worked in the fields.\u201d\n\n**The \u201cgat\u201d or \u201chuekrip\u201d is the hat made of horse hair and worn by Joseon men. The wider the hat, the higher the social status.** (In \"Mr. Sunshine,\" Kyle, the US Marine officer/friend of Eugene Choi jokingly mispronounced \"gat\" as \"God.\")",

            "comment": "The amount of fun information is this post is stunning! Here is some that caught my attention.\n\n&gt;It is thought that Yangban women developed \u201cneolttwigi\u201d to see over the walls that surrounded their homes, as women in traditional Korea were rarely allowed out of their living compounds, except at night.\n\nThat is actually sad. However, the \"... except the night\" part is really odd.  Leaving only at night actually sounds more dangerous. I am already imagining Joseon women leading a double life with wild girls-night-out escapades. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThat makes me think, in Sageuks, women are sometimes portrayed wearing men's clothing when doing outside activities that wouldn't be seen as suitable for a lady at that time. They are often portrayed being taken for eunuchs by other men. I wonder if there is a grain of truth in that. Is it possible that women would at times cross-dress to get a little bit more freedom or is it purely done for dramatization.\n\n&gt;From Wikipedia: Tessenjutsu (Japanese; lit. \u201ciron fan technique\u201d) is the martial art of the Japanese war fan (tessen). It is based on the use of the solid iron fan or the folding iron fan, which usually had eight or ten wood or iron ribs. The use of the war fan in combat is mentioned in early Japanese legends.\n\nOMG, I can't believe that there is some truth to Kitana from Mortal Combat!\n\nI have to admit, these iron fan battles must have been epic to watch.",

Is it possible that women would at times cross-dress to get a little bit more freedom is it purely done for dramatization.\n\nPlease read the answer/comment in \"Cross-dressing &amp; sageuk?\" at https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/35uc2q/crossdressing_sageuk/\n\nFor a more scholarly discussion, please read **\"Women's Life during the Chos\u014fn Dynasty - International Journal of Korean History\"** at https://ijkh.khistory.org/upload/pdf/6_05.pdf\n\n**Excerpts:** (emphasis by boldfacing supplied)\n\n&gt;The imposition of such restrictions on women\u2019s lifestyles was  especially pronounced during the reign of King Sejong (1418\u223c1450). During this period, women were prohibited from visiting the temple monastery, and conversely, monks from paying visit to a widow\u2019s residence.  Moreover, the Sejong era also saw women from the sadaebu \nclass have their right to visit areas of worship (sinso) situated in both the capital and outlaying areas curtailed. **The head of the household of any  women found guilty of breaking this edict was punished accordingly.**\n&gt;\n&gt;The naewoeb\u014fp, which imposed stringent restrictions on inter-gender contact, represented the first stage of an attempt to embed the notion of chastity within the mindset of Chos\u014fn women.\n&gt;\n&gt;The Ky\u014fngjae yukj\u014f \u7d93\u6fdf\uf9d1\u5178 Six Codes of Governance), which was compiled during the reign of King Sejong, outlines how women from the yangban class were  permitted to interact with their immediate family (parents and siblings) \nand their paternal and maternal relatives (uncles and aunts\u2019 families  within 3 degrees (ch\u2019on) of relations). **This regulation, while not  immediately implemented, had the effect of seriously curtailing women\u2019s activities outside of the household as well as inter-gender contact.** Even  more severe restrictions were imposed on those women who belonged to  the royal clan. Some other potential measures which were discussed during this period included the following: **men and women should not  travel along the same roads, should not meet at the market, and should  occupy different quarters at all times.**\n&gt;\nSuch regulations were further strengthened during the reign of King  S\u014fngjong. According to the Ky\u014fngguk taej\u014fn (\u7d93\u570b\u5927\u5178 National Code) compiled during the reign of King S\u014fngjong, **\u201cAny women who visits a temple \u2026 Any woman from the sajok (yangban) class who attends a festival in the mountains or by the riverside, or who conducts a (yaje  sanch\u014fn or s\u014fnghwang samyoje) ritual ceremony, shall will receive 100 lashes.\u201d**\n&gt;\n&gt;The imposition of such regulations would seem to indicate that  festivals in the mountains or by the riverside were a popular form of entertainment for women of the yangban class both in Seoul and in outlaying areas. The continued influence of Buddhism, which had been \ndeeply entrenched during the Kory\u014f dynasty, is visible in the fact that even during the early period of the Chos\u014fn dynasty women were free to visit temples or engage in ceremonial rites for various shaman gods, such as the house god. However, over time such practices were thoroughly \nweeded out as part of the new neo-Confucianist order which was being created.\n&gt;\n&gt;**The rigid naewoeb\u014fp also imposed severe restrictions on women\u2019s  activities outside of the household. As a result of this law, women from all classes but the lowest were forced to hide their faces with an outer garment whenever they left the house, with different garments being used  to identify a woman\u2019s social status.** In keeping with this, women from the yangban class were forced to wear changot (hood), while commoners had  to don a ssuge chima (shawl). **Yangban women were forced to get around  on horseback or in a palanquin and assure that their faces were never  exposed to passersby.** Such palanquins were also used by female entertainers whenever they left the house and palace women when the king would set out on a journey or get married. \n\n**In relation to K-dramas:**\n\nIn \"Saimdang,\" the young Saimdang (played by Park Hye-soo) always complained to her father as to why she or other women were not allowed to climb Mount Geumgang, which was a pilgrimage site for scholars, artists, etc. during the Joseon Dynasty.\n\nIn Ep. 22 of \"The King's Doctor\" aka \"Horse Doctor,\" the ML Kwang-hyun (played by Cho Seung-woo) was arrested for meeting a noblewoman (Jo Bo-ah) alone; from the subtitles, it seems he was arrested for immorality or of harassing a nobleman's widow.\n\nIn \"Chuno, Slave Hunters,\" while they're on the run, Tae-ha emphasized to Hye-won the Confucian principle of the strict separation between men and women.",

I guess, the drama creators have no choice but to bend the rules a bit (for example, by cross dressing the female characters) , because, with such strict societal rules, it would be hard to produce a story that would please the modern viewer.\n\nIt is quite ironic though that in such a patriarchal society the Queen Sunwon served as a regent for two terms and therefore was close to being the ruler of the country.",

                                    "comment": "**Some other interesting Korean queens in history are:**\n\n**Queen Munjeong**: She ruled as Regent from 1545 until 1565 for her son, King Myeongjong. She was portrayed in \"A Jewel in the Palace\" Eps. 19-54 and as the Queen Mother in the 2016 hit \u201cThe Flower in Prison.\u201d\n\nFor more information about this remarkable queen, please read \u201cQueen Munjeong\u2019s (1501-1565) Statecraft and Buddhist View in Confucian Joseon\u201d\nat https://kj.accesson.kr/assets/pdf/8351/journal-54-2-62.pdf\n\n**Queen Insoo**: she's probably the most portrayed queen in Korean history.\n\n**Empress Myeongseong** (or Empress Myungsung): informally known as Empress Min, she was the official wife of Gojong, the 26th king of Joseon and the first emperor of the Korean Empire. Her predecessor as Queen was Queen Cheorin.\n\nEmpress Myeongseong was assassinated by Japanese forces.\n\nI've seen three portrayals of Empress Myeongseong:\n\n- 2010 historical-medical drama \"Jejoongwon\"\n- 2014 drama \"The Joseon Gunman\"\n- 2009 movie \"The Sword with No Name\" with the ML played by Cho Seung-woo\n\n**Queen Seondeok** of Silla, Korea's first female monarch; among other achievements, she built the Cheomseongdae, an astronomical observatory.\n\nShe was portrayed by Lee Yo-won in the 2009 blockbuster hit \"Queen Seondeok\" (one of my favorite dramas). If you haven't watched this drama yet, I recommend it to you. It's 62 episodes; it was supposed to be only 51 episodes but was extended because of its enormous popularity. If watching 62 episodes intimidates you, watch this Ep. 10 clip where Deokman (future Queen Seondeok) first showed her leadership abilities. The link is https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IIfUi2f4kNs&amp;t=2m4s (starting at around the 2:04 mark, with English subs available). From this clip, you might become interested in watching the whole drama. Caution, however, because this specific scene is a gory battle scene. (The romance in the rest of the drama is great.)\n\nDuring the childhood years, Deokman (future Queen Seondeok) was played by Nam Ji-hyun, while &gt;!her sister Princess Cheongmyeong!&lt; was played by Shin Se-kyung. Their chemistry is awesome.\n\nIn \"Queen Seondeok,\" Deokman had to pretend to be a boy/young man because of the threats to her life. She finally finds out who she really is in Ep. 21, if I remember correctly.",

Like I said, the chemistry between Nam Ji-hyun as the young \"Deokman\" and Shin Se-kyung as the young &gt;!\"Princess Cheongmyeong\"!&lt; is amazing.\n\nThe prophecy in Ep. 1 of \"Queen Seondeok\" will remind you of Ep. 1 of \"The King's Affection.\"\n\nIf you become a Deokman-&gt;!Kim Yushin!&lt; shipper, you should only watch Episodes\n1-51 and then skip to Ep. 62 (Finale) at the 53:17 mark. The final scene between Deokman-&gt;!Kim Yushin!&lt; is so emotional because Deokman realizes that &gt;!Kim Yushin!&lt; has been there for her all her life.\n\nBut if you become a Deokman-&gt;!Bidam!&lt; shipper, then you should also watch Eps. 52-62. &gt;!Bidam!&lt; is played by Kim Nam-gil. He first appears in Ep. 21.\n\nI was a Deokman-&gt;!Kim Yushin!&lt; shipper. I hate &gt;!Bidam!&lt;.\n\nMost of the male characters in \"Queen Seondeok\" are members of the elite group of Silla warriors known as \"Hwarang.\" Ep. 1 has a scene where the Hwarang warriors demonstrate how dedicated they are to the point of death. Watch \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N5aVSYhWnuk&amp;t=4m16s starting at 4:16 mark when Mishil (the drama's antagonist) leads the Hwarang warriors to challenge the king. (You'll notice that the Hwarang warriors are wearing makeup; the legend is that they wanted to look beautiful when they die.)\n\nHwarang warriors are historical. (There's a martial art system known as \"Hwa Rang Do\" that claims to have roots in the historical Hwarang warriors.)",

Examples:\n\n- In \"The Moon That Embraces The Sun,\" Lee Hwon (played by Kim Soo-hyun) is younger than Yang Myung. But since Yang Myung is the son of a Royal Noble Concubine, Lee Hwon became the Crown Prince and (later) King since he's the Queen's son.\n\n- In Son Ye-jin\u2019s historical movie \"The Last Princess,\" her character is called \"oongju\" since she's the daughter of a Royal Noble Concubine; the Queen's daughter is called \"goongju.\" (Not sure about correct spellings of \"oongju\" and \"goongju.\")\n\n&gt;I have seen where days the king is sent to the Queen (for purpose of producing an heir) are calculated out and this is another guess by knowing the Queens menstrual cycle and best days to conceive?

Examples:\n\n- The main character in the 2007 movie \"Shadows of the Palace\" is a lady physician (nurse). She solves the mysteries (suicide, births, etc) by consulting the menstrual charts/histories of the royal women in the palace. Trailer at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Wa81VbiQU\n\n- The 2012 movie \"The Concubine\" starring Cho Yeo-jeong shows in a scene how the eunuchs and female attendants guide the King and Queen on what to do as they have sex. Trailer at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ1ZfTCoSeY\n\n&gt;What do you think of Masquerade?\n\nI love \"Masquerade\" not only because of the story and characters but also because Han Hyo-joo is in it. I've loved Han Hyo-joo since I first saw her in \"Dong Yi.\" I also love her movies \"Cold Eyes\" and \"Love, Lies.\"\n\nThe scene that I love most in \"Masquerade\" are (1) when the clown/king has to relieve himself using a chamber pot and the attendants do everything for him (these scenes are so hilarious!); and (2) when the young court maid sacrificed herself to save the clown/king.\n\n&gt;I also immensely enjoyed Mr. Sunshine.\n\nI posted a discussion on the historical and cultural backgrounders of \"Mr. Sunshine\" at https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/121ia4i/mr_sunshine_historical_and_cultural_backgrounders/",

Many people today do not understand how milk is produced and how it is plentiful today.\n\nSo butters, cheeses and even pasteurized milk were extreme luxuries that even Queens may rarely enjoy.\n\nThe mashed potato disk with milk served to the Queen was [Gnocchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnocchi).\n\nThis is the 1st K-DRAMA I've watched in over 2 decades. What attracted me was the time travel aspect of a high-end chef being able to cook for a Royal Court.  Took them too many episodes to get to that part.",

In Ep. 15, Queen Cheorin finds out from &gt;!her father!&lt; that the secret ledger contains &gt;!the records of the Andong Kim clan\u2019s corruption!&lt;. The ledger was hidden in &gt;!the well!&lt;. The Punyang Jo clan wants to use the ledger to &gt;!bring down the rival Andong Kim clan!&lt;.\n\nI believe that the assassin-spy is a drug addict, although I don't think it was ever mentioned what kind of drug he was addicted to. His addiction was the way by which he was controlled by Minister Kim Jwa-geun.",

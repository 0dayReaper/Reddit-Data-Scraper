No adrenaline rush or psychopath thrillers.\n\nJust a nice family drama with a fun cast of characters (even Cruella and Grannie).  Something to look forward to but no regrets if I'm not able to watch for a couple of days after it airs.  \n\nVery different from my obsession with Alchemy of Souls a year ago - I actually revised my vacation schedule so that I could be sure to watch the final episodes of Part 1 the moment it released.",

They kind of did, but while some episodes felt like filler, they spent a lot of time developing the characters and the relationships. Every time I was on the verge of getting bored, there was an interesting twist I did not see coming that changed the direction of the show.\n\nThe grandma had been so toxic and unreasonable I had her pegged for one of those evil drama characters with no depth...and then they gave her the &gt;!illiteracy!&lt; story line! And the frenemy relationship with &gt;!Yeon Doo's mom.!&lt; So you start seeing her in a different light, thinking about everything she's been hiding. She's putting up with stuff you never thought she would do &gt;!to learn how to read.!&lt; I never realized there were so many women in that generation that &gt;!were illiterate.!&lt; It's really cool that the show is highlighting it and I'm hoping it will be catalyst for change for grandma.\n\nSame for the little niece's obsession with YouTube at the beginning. It felt shallow, but now having learned her motivation I'm totally rooting for her also getting a new mom out of it \ud83d\ude09\n\nTae Kyung was starting to get on my nerves with the puppy eyes, but I'm curious about how he will handle the latest developments. Now he has to see if he can commit...",

I have to admit that I didn't really follow the argument that she can't think about herself, she has to think of the baby.  (Though his family is certainly a piece of work -- maybe she doesn't want to subject Jinjja to that?)  If that really is her motivation, how would entering into a real but time-limited relationship be good for the baby?\n\nAnyway, nothing is ever straightforward in longform, I'm noticing (except Hye Young in **My Father is Strange**!). So, I'm expecting something twisty.\n\nEdit: baby name.",

Not only he constaly in conflict with his own family with all the inheritance, but also there is a possibility where Tae Kyung will regret raising a child that's not his or worse, has his own baby with Yeon Doo and started to treat Jinja badly just like his family treating him as he is the step brother.\n\nSo now she just buying time until it is illegal for abortion so that either of the family (and the real dad) can't forced her to have one and committed to be a single mom. \n\nOne thing I love about this show is that they have a lot of strong single mom characters (Yeon Doo's mom, Tae Kyung's mom, the pharmacist and also Yeon Doo's uncle new love interest). I never think of it before, but damn raising a child is hard and now imagine how to do it all alone. Glad this theme is highlighted in this kdrama",

She also realised that getting a divorce was a bad idea, while Sejin is still going around treating her dad like shit. So to me Sejin is the worst followed by her mother,  Geum Sil, Yun ah and Tae Kyungs older siblings. Yun ah is on real thin ice with me. If he teams up with Sejin to take down Yeon Doo and Tae Kyung then he'll become the worst one since is also a deadbeat and a cheater.",

That makes me so excited about their development.\n\nOther storyline I'm invested in:\n1. Yoo Myung and Dong Wok. Hopefully Yoo Myung fallen in love with both Soo Gyeom and Dong Wook and open up to be in relationship. Not expecting she changes her mind of becoming a mother cause her body her choice, but maybe a step mom perhaps?\n\n2. Hyun Woo and Ji Myung. Sometimes I feel like this couple is a lost cause and they should just get a divorce and share custody of the baby later. Hyun Woo really wanted to be a father and when he met the pharmacist and bonded with her son I was like, sure go for this lady. Ji Myung also seems like has unresolved feeling with her jr. But, when Ji Myung and Yeon Doo has a hair pulling fight, Hyun Woo step up and defended her, so I'm not sure about them, but very intrigued with their plot.\n\n3. Jang Ho and Bong Nim. Obviously the show wanted to pair this two together, and he has finalized his divorce as well. The family also love Jang Ho living together in the same house. However, this surely will create more conflicts with Se Jin and her mom, the later started to miss her ex husband.\n\nSo many storyline so little time. This is my first long drama, and I'm loving every episode I'm watching.",

Her mother in law is happily married to a man that isn't Tae Kyung's father, and they've been together at least since Tae Kyung was in high school so, in a way, a man that wasn't his father had a hand in raising him.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!If Tae Kyung's open and willing to raise and love the baby, and if Yeon Du loves him back, then there's literally no issue. But I guess you can't do 50 episodes if you don't throw in pointless drama wherever possible. I think the true conflict to develop between them should have been him being all in about her, but being on the fence about being a dad. Then, she'd been justified in keeping him at arms length if he wasn't willing to accept her and the baby as a package deal. I hope that'll become the deeper issue between them. Yeon Du loving him, but not being willing to put him above her baby, and Tae Kyung loving her, but having a hard time letting go of his old beliefs. Plus, I don't get the point of now dating for two months with the plan of breaking up in the end!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I am looking forward to whatever drama Jun Ha is gonna stir up.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Who do we think sent Yeon Do's father is law the warning about Se Jin?

The FL just stands still not returning the hug but getting down and jiggy (and getting pregnant albeit without the SML\u2019s knowledge) with the SML was not a problem. It doesn\u2019t spoil the show for me, it\u2019s just a strange but interesting dynamic between the ML and FL.\n\nThe show so far is going well, I am enjoying each and every episode so far. IMO, I would like for more things to start going wrong for the ML and FL because things have been going far too well for too many episodes in their favour and not much else in terms of any real issues or challenges against them. SML hasn\u2019t taken any action for four eps and I hope the story doesn\u2019t stagnate and we will then be relying on the other relationship storylines to fill the gap.",

Normally the weekend dramas I have attempted to watch tend to be so makjang and low budget that I can\u2019t make it past 10 or so episodes. This one however is so entertaining that it doesn't feel like I've watched 24 episodes and I'm also invested in so many of the side character stories (Grandma and Yeon-doos mum scenes are exceptionally funny). It hasn't been draggy, misunderstandings cleared very quickly by the next episode and the Leads are so cute together.\n\nWas watching Dr Cha while it was airing on the same days alongside TRHC and actually found myself anticipating TRHC episodes much more so than Dr Cha. I'm also constantly checking MDL comments on the show each week since we don't have a weekly episode chat here.\n\nAnyway, so far so good and hoping it continues that way \ud83e\udd1e",

I am 100% convinced this will happen. \n\nOnce this happens, they'll do a time skip to FL giving birth and real chilling. Mark my words, they won't show FL's baby bump at all lol and actually I am not sure why they arent doing it yet",

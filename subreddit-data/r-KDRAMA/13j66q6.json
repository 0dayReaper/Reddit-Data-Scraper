The actual original HP soundtracks are good as soundtracks go, and I would love for more fans to discover my personal favorite [Chu Chu Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/63Utqot9jnC3MFgWySGdTK?si=1zbIHNP-RMqXW0KlTF54Jw) (though it\u2019s better to be a fan of Gomgom besides ;)",

Yay to IkSong and YiBom and to all couples who have that quiet, constant, steady kind of love- one that wraps you up like a cocoon and makes you feel warm, secure, cherished and protected, like finding your home in another person. \u2764\ufe0f",

And the relationship between the 2 couples were fun to watch, but they were definitely not gold standard. Truth be told, ML and FL were toxic. There was petty jealousy, manipulation, immaturity, lying, etc. While they had chemistry, I wouldn't really want a relationship like that for myself as there's just no feeling of security. It would be exhausting and frustrating, to say the least. As opposed to the Happiness and HosPlay couples where you could be yourself with your partner, and even without grand declarations or gestures of love, you wouldn't even have to wonder if they love you. You could feel their love and sincerity in the absence of words, the quietness of their actions. You just know that they would prioritize your well-being even at the cost of theirs- no hidden agenda, no selfish motives. They are your safe place even when the world is in chaos. That's the kind of love we aspire to have, and I'm glad most in this sub agree with us.",

But then 2 more songs were added to 2521 (so now there are 5 songs for 2521) and \"Very Slowly\" was mysteriously gone from the list. Just curious.",

Feels like, EAW was something monumental, too. It's one of the few dramas that I can still remember every single character and how the story went on.\n\nAlso Lim Ji Yeon, what an antagonist, she'll be an even better one in the future and she's already an outstanding one. \n\nWould like to give credits to Shin Ye-Eun tho, she really set that character's personality/trait perfectly. She's my kdrama \"crush\" and I was pissed of by her character, that's how good she was, personally.",

She knew the show could be hurtful to some people but still wanted to make a positive impact. If the show was deemed ableist by the majority of viewers,, she would be the one most affected and her 27 yr career would\u2019ve gone down the drain. \n\nImagine her fears as she wondered if YW would be accepted by viewers. And then imagine how she feels now winning her first ever daesang from Korea's most prestigious award show. EAW is a solid show, but she was the standout performance, and I'm just glad she got that award. No one deserves it more, truly.",

I personally enjoyed it, but these kinds of show very often cause me unbearable cringe, and there were definitely a few such moments, but not as many as I expected. \n\nI had to pause a few times, or maybe fast forward a few seconds, but there were quite a few scenes that was really good, the kind that I don't mind rewatching every now and then.\n\nSince you're a lawyer I cannot comment on how you'd perceive that, but you should give it a try. It's not bad from the start, but like many kdrama it will get better and better as get further in. This is a lawyer show so there are different cases deciding the tone somewhat, and imo the better cases come in the middle to the late of the show.\n\nYou should be able to tell by first episode whether you'll enjoy it or not.",

Basically she has super memory, so even though she is awkward, she is gifted enough to make a difference and as the series continue she will also naturally get some recognition for that (which is also why I think it gets better the deeper you get into the show). \n\nOther than that, there is also some additional plots in the story which I think made it even better.\n\nBut for the most part it is pretty light-hearted (not 100% as there are some scenes that are more serious for lack of a better word).\n\nI would've actually liked a character like this, but used in a more dark series, for example if they were criminal lawyers dealing only with serious crimes. Some psychological parts to it maybe. It would've been even better if we get to her hear thought process, how she mentally prepare to mask as it happens. But unfortunately they seem to only do lighter versions with such characters.\n\nIf you haven't seen Move to Heaven you could give that a go as well. The main character has Asperger's, it's not a law show though. There's no cringe moments in that series, and it actually has a little bit of a darker tone; very emotional at least. It's one of my top 3 dramas.",

If the show treats her like the most special unicorn ever than it makes Autistic professionals seem unusual and rare, when in fact there are lots and lots of us.  I didn\u2019t mind the newspaper clipping about her being the first Autistic lawyer in Korea, because there was similar media coverage of the \u201cfirst\u201d Autistic lawyer in the United States, after I had already been practicing for over a decade.  What is new is the generation of high functioning Autistics who got diagnosed in childhood, which started in the 1990s, being old enough to join the professions.  Autistic professionals have always been here, we just weren\u2019t diagnosed and openly Autistic before.",

The courtroom scenes were reasonably accurate, and I liked her ability to issue spot the civil law consequences of a criminal conviction.  I wish her bedroom didn\u2019t look so obviously set-decorated.  Even if you really love whales, who has the executive functioning for such elaborate decor?  I also would have put her in *way* more comfortable shoes.  But nothing was offensive to me.  I\u2019ll keep watching.",

While others, with physical features alone like glaring eyes are perfect for the antagonist role. Not that it\u2019s the only thing they can, but they are so fit for it. \n\nJa Yeon\u2019s eyebrows are enough. Holy, that woman glares at your soul through your eyes. Heo-sung Tae is an actor that I can think of when I hear \u201cvillain.\u201d He\u2019s so perfect for it, like a real gangster lol.",

I was watching her acceptance speech and started bawling with her.\n\nThough as you said there could have been problems with the representation, she did such a great job that made the character so likable and vivid and real. The reach the show has was just incredible. I was in a meeting about autism research with a Hollywood producer who has an autistic family member and I was amazed when he brought up EAW to recommend it. I hope Eun Bin is getting noticed more and more internationally because she's an amazing actress.",

I was already thinking \"what if she doesn't?\" I don't know how to feel if she didn't, actually.\n\nRight? A single mistake, could've been disastrous for the whole series and the whole team. The way she moves, speaks was not overdone, you can see how much heart she put into it. I'm actually at the point that the next time I watch Eunbin, my mind will instinctively think that she's playing the same role again. She made Attorney Woo hers.",

Okay, she wasn't THAT big during the Full House days, but she was already royalty during TWTWB and DOTS days. DOTS was just as massive as TG, but she only won the popularity award that year. \n\nI think they were surprised by her performance in a completely different genre than the ones she usually does and they thought she deserved it.  \n\nAlso, there's a lot of work that goes into acting besides the acting part itself. Hye Kyo prepared *hard* for this role. Went on a diet for months, starved herself for days, all to look frail, fragile, and tired. She said she felt sick and completely exhausted most of the time, which helped her get into Dong-eun's head and body. She dedicated herself one hundred percent, so I wouldn't say it was a walk on the park compared to the other roles.\n\nTo me, all the nominees were on the same level here. I'm content with the result and I think it was absolutely fair.",

An actor who is just incredibly charismatic, and naturally and instantly 'loveable' but also has the gravitas to show deep pain, regret, misery, etc. And also someone who could realistically look like a student but also a grown, broken man. \n\nWhen I was watching JCW's excellent performance in \"If You Wish Upon Me\" I kept thinking, HE would have been so perfect for the SOOD Male Lead.",

I\u2019m so happy she won Best Actress. There\u2019s something gripping about her acting in The Glory, a new kind of role for her, she did great portraying a vulnerable but strong and smart and determined woman, and she totally deserves the awards. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nI really love Extraordinary Attorney Woo and all the cast but The Glory team is as solid good, so I\u2019m happy and content this year!",

It seems like they gave The Glory best drama because they gave the best script to My Liberation Notes.  I, too, liked The Glory for the acting. But you're right there were other better shows like Under the Queen's Umbrella which wasn't even nominated.  I haven't watched My Liberation Notes yet, but among the other shows that were nominated for best drama, IMO, The Glory was the weakest.  And Kim Hye-soo should have been best actress because Park Eun-bin won the Daesang!!!",

Eun Bin goes up to SHK and respectfully bows and SHK reaches out and touches her reassuringly on the arm. Then after, you see them giggling and being giddy together (obviously congratulating each other.) What a great moment. (And I don't think I have ever seen SHK laughing at any event ever this much.)\n2. (Photo of) the **Glory cast** having a casual dinner after the awards ceremony - all dressed down and clearly celebrating the wins. Ji Yeon seated closely to Do Hyun, who joined together with Cha Joo Young (didn't see the 2 at the ceremony.)\n3. Adorable **Tae Ri** being her usual giddy self. She had the cutest reaction when SHK made a joke during her speech teasing Lim Ji Yeon's character \"Hey Yeon Jin, I just got an award!\" Tae Ri literally squealed at the joke. LOVE her. Lots of footage showing her giggling with **Junho** (and her excitedly cheering for the winners they announced.) They NEED to be in a K Drama together!!\n4. **Kim Ji Won** and **Son Suk Ku** taking selfies together. Very sweet and cute. Someone even captured Son Suk Ku helping adjust Ji Won's gown as she was walking -  like a groom following his bride lo. And how hot was he at the ceremony?!",

But with some actors, even when  they're expressionless, you can see them thinking and feeling (and I don't mean gurning like some do) but she just seemed uninterested all the time.\n\nShe was a bit like that in *That winter, the wind blows,* although I liked her in *Descendants of the sun* and *Encounter.*\n\nAfter Eun-bin, I would have given best actress to Kim Tae-ri in *Twenty five twenty one.*",

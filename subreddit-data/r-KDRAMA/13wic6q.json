            "comment": "Here is [my challenge list](https://mydramalist.com/list/4YWGZKmL).\n\nThis month I finished:\n\n18. Drama with a dream interpretation - **Bo Ra Deborah -** In the first episode, &gt;!the FL falls asleep to Masked Singer and she dreams the chicken singer proposes to her. She interprets that as her boyfriend, heir to Mom's Chicken, will propose to her.!&lt;\n\n19. Drama with minimal romance - **Black Knight** \\- I loved this one, though I understand the criticism. Still I loved the action and Woo Bin killed it. This is probably my guilty pleasure lol.\n\n25. Drama whose poster you liked - **Duty After School 1 &amp; 2** \\- I did not know a drama could self destruct worse than Something in the Rain until I watched this.\n\n27. Drama found by searching existing recommendations - **Matching! Boys Archery -** MDL had been suggesting this one for awhile and I was never interested because I never heard anyone ever mention this. A Boy's Love webtoon artist infiltrates a handsome team of archery athletes and uses them for story material. It's a giant teaser for BL content. Which means MDL understands me well.\n\n35. Drama that is 10 years old - **Drama Special Season 4: My Friend Is Still Alive -** this was beautiful if you need a good cry.\n\nIn Progress:\n\n15. A drama with multigenerational cast - **Good Bad Mother**\n\n33. Long Form Drama - **It's Beautiful Now**",

            "comment": "May was more productive for me than all the months before.\n\n*Completed*\n\n*(#9 Supporting Actor)* - **Stealer: The Treasure Keeper** (Jo Han Chul): Very fun rompt. The characters have fun interactions and built a nice found family, the setting regarding the national treasures is very interesting and quite unique, and the robberies are plain fun. Especially the vault escape rooms.\n\n*(#15 Multigenerational Main Cast)* - **Hunted/Boar Hunt**: Very good thriller. The village setting is very creepy, the cinematography is gorgeous and helps to establish the atmosphere of persistance dread and unease. One noticeable flaw: The mother character is lacking depth and her own arc. Especially in contrast to the father, who has a fantastic story line.\n\n*(#22 Revenge)* - **Payback: Money and Power**: Okay, but very bland revenge drama. Most characters don't have a lot of depth. In the first half the good guys were weirdly incompetent, but more interesting on a personal level (eg. the uncle-nephew-relationship). In the second half that was swapped, and the heart was noticeable missing.\n\n*(#24 Always wanted to watch)* - **Awaken**: It's been on top of my watchlist for a very long time, but somehow other shows just slipped past this one. Finally watched it, and it was an engaging mystery. I especially loved the 'murders' and ofc Namkoong Min. He was fantastic as always. In the middle it started to meander, but overall it stayed interesting and had a satisfying end.\n\n*(#25 Liked Poster at First Sight)* - **Black Knight**: The posters had Mad Max Fury Road vibes, so it immediately interested me. Sadly it fell short of my expectations. Because it was so short it was okay to watch, although a very bland dystopian show with a very boring villain. The plot strings were messy and did not really interconnect or matter in the scheme of things. \n\n*Currently Watching*\n\n*(#21 Disguise/False Identity)* - **Leverage (8/16)**: Very fun so far. The OG version is one of my fav tv shows, and I think they made a good adaptations. It is changed enough to be it's own thing while remaing faithful to the heart of the OG. The team is very likeable, although I do think that the OG characters were overall a bit more charismatic und felt more real with more depth.\n\n*(#33 Long Form Drama)* - **Queen Seon Deok (8/62)**: Enjoyable so far. Really enjoy the villainess and the princess sister. \n\n*(#?????)* - **One Day Off (1/8)**: Just started it last night and it's absolutely fantastic. It's so relaxing to watch LNY take these day trips and just escape normal life for a day. I'll decide if and what category later. ATM I just want to enjoy the show and relax.\n\nCompleted 10/36.",

            "comment": "This month I finished:\n\n**Glitch** - (Wheel of Chance Trope: Amnesia) I wouldn\u2019t say this was excellent, but I very much enjoyed how different it was from your typical Kdrama. Short, tongue-in-cheek, and fast-paced. Queer-coded. Nana and Jeon Yeo Been killed it in their roles.\n\n**Still 17** (Trope subversion) It was a pleasant surprise to find another 10/10 drama so soon after my last one (My Country: The New Age). This was so very pure. Watching this made me realise that healing dramas are my thing.  I already knew this from Mr Queen but Shin Hye Sun really is an excellent physical actress. \n\n**Once Again** Yay! I finished 100 x 30 min episodes and enjoyed it! I loved Lee Cho Hee and Lee Sang Yi\u2019s love story best of all, but there were many other cute side plots to enjoy.  Hers was not my favourite character, but whenever Lee Min Jung was onscreen I couldn\u2019t help but think, wow this lady is gorgeous!\n\n**Seven First Kisses** (Has one or more tropes from The Heirs) This was a cute, short watch (total run time 2 hours) and the perfect palate cleanser when I felt Once Again was at its draggiest. Lee Cho Hee was perfect as the girl next door getting a chance to date seven famous oppas. My favourite was Taecyon\u2019s episode!\n\n**The Red Sleeve** (Drama you\u2019ve always wanted to watch) I\u2019ve hyped myself up too much for this one. I\u2019ll be finishing this tonight and so far this isn\u2019t the epic romance I thought I was getting. Junho is a master, though, and I am enjoying this as a well-made sageuk.\n\nThis coming June I\u2019m planning to watch **Homme Fatale** for more Junho which I think fits a 2022/2021 challenge (Kmovie). I\u2019m also likely going to watch my drama that was released ten years ago or more.  Deciding between **The Heirs**, **The Slave Hunters**, **Sungkyungkwan Scandal** or **Goong**. Opinions welcome!",

Not a drama I was into, but it was short.\n* **She Was Pretty** \u2014 Challenge 27, a drama found by searching existing recommendations. I found a recommendation for this one on the kdramarecommends subreddit. I really enjoyed this drama more than I thought I would, so I thank the person who recommended it. The link to the recommendation is on my MDL list for the challenge.\n* **Sell Your Haunted House Special** \u2014 Challenge 33, a drama with less than 500 watchers on MDL. It had 440 watchers by the time of completion, and only 221 had completed it. This was a recap + behind the scenes.\n* **Joseon Attorney: A Morality** \u2014 Challenge 2, a drama which subverts tropes. I moved a few challenges around to insert this drama into the list, and this is where it ended up. It included a woman holding a man from falling, and it also had the FL save the ML.\n* **The Devil Judge** \u2014 Challenge 8, a drama with a main lead that started off as a child actor. Kim Min Jung made this drama fit the challenge. Bonus: she was one of the best parts of the drama. A+ actress.\n* **Goblin Special: Every Moment of It Shined** \u2014 Challenge 32, a single episode drama. This was on Viki, and it was more of a recap with some bloopers at the end.\n\nI have 4 dramas in progress, too.\n\n* **Itaewon Class (4/16)** \u2014 Challenge 22, a drama which features a character seeking revenge. Park Sae Ro Yi is awesome, and I'm rooting for him.\n* **Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha (10/16)** \u2014 Undecided, but it fits multiple challenges.\n* **The Good Bad Mother (10/14)** \u2014 Also undecided, but I've made a document with all challenges that this drama (and all the others) fit in. Once it finishes airing, I'll decide on a slot.\n* **A Business Proposal (6/12)** \u2014 Challenge 5, a drama chose by the Wheel of Chance: Tropes. Mine is \"ends up at a playground after a few drinks\", which happened in episode 5. This drama is tropes galore, and I love it for existing.\n\nThis leaves me with 11 uncompleted challenges! Less than a third of the challenges left!\n\nDuring June, I'll also be picking up **Bloodhounds**, **King the Land,** **See You in My 19th Life**, and **Revenant**. If I don't finish the challenge by the time they're done, they might take the place of some dramas I haven't started yet.",

Down to my last 2 to finish [MDL](https://mydramalist.com/list/32AaNKOL) \n\nI got stuck this month on 17 (alma mater being a plot point) so what I ended up doing is shifting my picks around so, I moved **King of Pigs** to that slot (fits if anyone is looking for a rec for there) so this much I finsihed; \n\n9 - featuring well know support actor - **Superior Day** (Ha Do Gwon)  \n\n05/25/2023 You had to do a lot of reaching on the plot, but I liked the characters in terms of the family. I think it would have made a better movie to be honest. But it wasn't as bad. \n\n11 - actor whose won best new actor Baeksang award - **Stealer: Treasure Keeper** (Joo Won) \n\n05/20/2023 It's a shame this didn't get a wider release, and it has a lot going for it. It was a lot a fun, and when the got the gang together it was a good.  \n\n16 - actor with same zodiac sign - **Secret Romantic Guesthouse** (Kang Hoon and I share a birthday May 23)\n\n12/05/2023 It lost momentum in the second half I was invested in some of the couples but not all. Honestly I thought it wrapped up a little too well, would have been better with a bit of a tragic end perhaps. \n\n18 - dream interpretation - **Bride of Haebaek**\n\n05/01//2023 It sort of fell apart in the middle I thought. Solid chemistry, but could have leaned more into the supernatural stuff. \n\n22 - revenge - **Black Knight**\n\n05/19/2023 Wish it had been longer was so much world building. 16 episodes would have been great. could have dived into more of the plot line and backstory. \n\n24 - always wanted to watch but never got around to it - **The Heirs**\n\n05/26/2023 I can now say I have officially watched the Heirs, it's been an absolutely wild ride. Wardrobe choices were made. Honestly my teen self would have loved this, it's actually sort of nostalgic to watch. I did miss Lee Min Ho's collarbones though. \n\n29 - suggested by another KDC participant - **Kairos** \n\n05/31/2023 On the recommendation of u/sianiam and u/myweithisway it did not disappoint! Binged it in 2 days, could not stop. If you love a time travel plot (and boy do I) this is for sure one of the better ones. Also my streak of sympathizing with morally ambiguous characters continues as I found myself painfully connecting with Ahn No Hyun's character. \n\nSo only two left! and once more here I am leaving my long form to last...I never learn. So I working my way through **The Secret House** 25/124 it's my first ever daily drama and it's not bad but I can't binge I can maybe get 2 - 4 episodes in then I need something else. \n\nMy other one is **Squad 38** for SIG, he was the lead in one of my first kdramas and it's on TUBI for free to watch. \n\nAnticipating being done in June!",

Hope I can get access to *Dr. Romantic 3* and *Family: the Unbreakable Bond* sometime this year!  \n*Completed in May:*  \n**Trot Lovers**  (# 11 - FL previously won required award) - really loved Shin Sung Rok in this - was he really just the 2ML? He was the star for me. FL did a great job in her role - man, can she sing!  \n**Stealer: The Treasure Keeper** \\-( #9 starring well-known support actor) Jo Han Chul plays a main role in this as the team's leader.   \n**Five Enough** (#33 Long Format)  Always try to get my long format drama in early in the year. This one was absolutely no chore. Enjoyed all the love lines - especially Shin Hye Sun's. Looking forward to seeing her in **See You in my 19th Life** \\- Hope I can watch it!  \nBrings me up to 21 dramas so far.\n\n  \n*Continuing:*  \nI am really enjoying the mystery and nostalgia of **My Perfect Stranger**, which I have down for # 36 - 2022's challenge #20 Takes place in multiple timelines.\n\nHalfway through **One Day Off**. Enjoying its calmness. A chance to unwind at the end of the day. I'm thinking it may fit Challenge #31 (less than 2% Nielson rating for at least one episode) since it is not on a major sender.\n\n Halfway through **Jealousy Incarnate / Don't Dare to Dream**. Picked it for #3 Referenced in another drama - it was mentioned in the recommendations for this challenge. Was hesitant when I realized it was 24 episodes of endless triangles - I think there are 5, so there is plenty of material to cover. Enjoying the moms the most.\n\nAny tips for a shortish multigenerational drama? Family dramas fit the bill, but are so long...",

There's also a unique spin on last episode separation. FL's ex, instead of becoming a pining hateful guy, he helps her and becomes friends with her.\n\n\n4) **Food- Jajangmyeon**: *Gaus Electronics*, hilarious all the way through. Never a boring moment. 2nd ML who is rich tries various food from 'streets' including Jajagmyeon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15) **Multigen Cast**: *She Makes My Heart Flutter*, follows an aunt and niece, who happens to be lesbians and their separate love stories. Simple, well acted, and amazingly directed mini drama.\n\n\n\n\n\n18) **Dream Interpretation**: *Scripting Your Destiny*, it'd be a spoiler if I mention how it fits here. Nevertheless, this is a short &amp; sweet drama (5hr long). Watch it if you want Goblin fix.\n\n\n\n20) **Athlete**: *Puck*, 2 episode drama about ice hockey. Cheesy and dramatic in a good way. Lee Kwang Soo is in serious role. Man can act. \n\n\n\n\n\n23) **Pet**: *Mouse*. Mice, cats, bird &amp; dog feature as pets, and they have significant bearing on the plot. I was already impressed with this writer because of *Black*, and she outdid herself here and actually stuck the landing properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28) **Review**: *Hit The Spot*, [the review](https://old.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/10504j3/so_are_we_gonna_talk_about_fanta_g_spot_aka_hit/), unique yet familiar KDrama. Boldest, eye-opener, and super fluffy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31) **&lt;2% rating**: *Fan letter, Please*, 4 ep drama, none of the ep rating went beyond 2%. It is extraordinary when it only focuses on the 3 MCs. But you also have sly reporters, exBFF drama etc. which bogged it down. But definitely worth watching for the 3 MCs.\n\n32) **Single Episode**: *My Friend is Still Alive*, guy gets leukemia, has 6 months to live and wants to have 1st kiss b4 he dies. So his friends start hunting. That's the beginning. It becomes more as it goes. On [Youtube](https://youtu.be/tGj7b29zQk0).\n\n\n\n34) **&lt;500 on MDL**: *Employment War (2014)*, 26 watchers. A mockumentary style web drama about 5 friends who are hell-bent on getting a job. It is awkward comedy in the vein of The Office. Leaves you wanting for more. It's on [Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjYNvL189bCaNUiP2etCxvGj3u3NFwLQU).",

Trope: Blind date with the wrong person*** \\- **Youth of May** features this trope where Fl's friend makes the FL go for a blind date with the ML (very much like Business Proposal). A period drama with a tragic but contented ending and a heartwarming romance, I really liked it.\n\n\\*\\*#\\*\\****31. Less than 2% overall viewership rate from Neilson*** \\- **Extraordinary Attorney Woo** had episodes 1 and 2 with less than 2% viewership rate.

Inspire by review, recommendation, or comment on*** r/KDRAMA ***or*** r/kdramarecommends \\- **Extracurricular** reallllyy kept me on edge. I loved how the drama had an open ending. Hope we get a season 2!\n\n\\*\\*#\\*\\****24. Always wanted to watch but have not*** \\- **The Silent Sea**. Wanted to watch it ever since its release because the poster looked cool and it stars Gong-Yoo and Bae-Doona, finally watched it. I don't watch much sci-fi let alone space movies/shows, but this one had me hooked. A great storyline and excellent cast.\n\n\\*\\*#\\*\\****25. Poster you liked at first sight*** \\- **Island.** Good drama. LLots of action, demons and magic, just how I like them but I wish they gave more context to Johan's character.\n\n\\*\\*#\\*\\****18. Dream interpretation*** \\- **Mystic Pop-up Bar**. An okay drama ut bcould have been better. Sung-Jae looks cute though!\n\n\\*\\*#\\*\\****7. Location: Park and Nature*** \\- **Crash Course in Romance**. It features the Seokchan Lake Park. A predictable story line but they executed it very well. Had fun watching it, and so did my sister.\n\nIn progress:\n\n***#36. Fits previous KDC challenge-*** **The Good Bad Mother**\n\n**#26.

Good lord, I was stressed basically the whole time.\n* Queenmaker (main cast member shares my zodiac sign). LADIES. It was great seeing so many excellent actresses playing varied and interesting characters.\n* Black Knight (minimal or no romance). I really liked the ideas this show presented! It wasn't perfect but it was interesting and magnetic, and Kim Woo Bin is only getting finer and finer with time... And I really appreciated that &gt;!it wrapped up the story neatly, with the bad guys getting theirs and hope for a future restored. Having a happy ending in a dystopia here and there is nice :)!&lt;\n* Bo Ra! Deborah (as it airs = challenge from KDC 2022). The most mixed bag of a show I've seen in quite a while. So light and fun at times, with two great lead actors, and then some just completely out-of-left-field writing choices. \n* Under the Queen\u2019s Umbrella (multigenerational main cast). What a great show. I knew it would be given how much everyone loved it, but truly, truly what a great show. I cried at least once every episode for the last several.\n\nIn progress:\n\n* Gu Family Book (repeat costars).\n* Live (well-known supporting actors). This is no longer on Netflix in my region, which is a hiccup, but I'll overcome and make it through this one yet.\n* The Master\u2019s Sun (at least one pet). I found this from the recommendations thread, I think, but I'm still waiting for a major pet character :D . There has been &gt;!a ghost dog!&lt;, which I say will do the trick if there isn't a different pet coming. I've been meaning to watch this for quite a while anyway -- it's nearly too scary for me, even with the decade-old effects!",

            "comment": "Hi all! It\u2019s my first time participating in the KDC and also my first check-in as I only chanced upon this in end-April. Am enjoying it so far! It has motivated me to finish many dramas I started but left hanging in January / February. Also venturing to try new types of drama that I wouldn\u2019t usually be drawn to like the long-form.\n\n**Completed**\n\nMARCH\n\n**Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo:** 20) main character athlete - Fluff in the best way, really got me out of my slump. I foresee myself re-watching it whenever I need a mood-lifter.\n\nAPRIL\n\n**Lovestruck in the City:** Challenge TBD - Couldn\u2019t get into this when I started this in Jan but binged through it when I picked it up again. I like the interview format of it. Also captivated by Kim Ji Won\u2019s acting.\n\n**The Bride of Habaek:** 18) dream interpretation - I really didn\u2019t enjoy this, felt that the ML &amp; FL didn\u2019t have any chemistry. Finished it only because I thought Nam Joo-Hyuk and Gong Myung looked good. Also couldn\u2019t get into Shin Se Kyung acting which was surprising because I\u2019ve heard she\u2019s good. Might have to try another of her drama.\n\n**Dr Romantic 1:** Challenge TBD - Took really long to start watching this because I wasn\u2019t sure I would like any other medical drama as much as Hospital Playlist but I really liked this too! They're not the same but I grew to care about the characters and Doldam.\n\n**Dr Romantic 2:** Challenge TBD - Binged this in two days. I cared about the characters in this season even more than the first. Especially invested in Ahn Hyo Seop\u2019s character, Seo Woo-Jin. Glad he's back in Season 3.\n\nMAY\n\n**Thirty But Seventeen:** 23) at least one pet - Also binged this and enjoyed it very much. Enjoyed seeing Yang Se Jong and Ahn Hyo Seop outside of Dr Romantic.\n\n**Dali and the Cocky Prince:** 2) subverts tropes - I loved how many times I thought, oh there\u2019s that cliche trope only to be pleasantly surprised. This drama also convinced me what a versatile actor Kim Min Jae is, I love how he\u2019s so different in this compared to Dr Romantic and Do You Like Brahms.\n\n**Thirty-Nine:** 30) direct title translation - Thought it was so beautiful but so sad. Couldn\u2019t watch the last two episodes for months and might not have finished it if not for the challenge. The cast did put up a captivating performance.\n\n**Descendants of the Sun:** 10) drama starring actor from my first drama; Song Hye Kyo, Autumn Tales from aeons ago - I enjoyed most of it until the last two episodes, felt like they were just dragging it out for the sake of fulfilling 16 episodes. Only completed them for the challenge.\n\n**Crash Landing On You:** 24) drama I\u2019ve always wanted to watch - I wasn\u2019t into k-dramas back when this was airing, but so many around me who I didn\u2019t expect to watch k-dramas were raving about it. I truly understand the hype. I laughed and cried along with the characters. Left this hanging for a while because I couldn\u2019t deal with some of the sadness but I was very satisfied when I completed it.\n\n**Touch Your Heart:** 13) co-stars on multiple occasions; Lee Dong Wook &amp; Yoo In Na - This was okay for me, I didn\u2019t really enjoy the court cases and the exaggerated acting of some of the supporting cast, but it was still heartwarming to see Sunny and Grim Reaper reunite.\n\n**Business Proposal:** 5) Wheel of Chance Tropes: Blind dates with wrong person - It\u2019s funny how I said I didn\u2019t enjoy the exaggerated acting of the previous drama but I really laughed at this one. Both couples also had great chemistry.\n\n**Fanletter, Please:** 12) member of kpop group; Choi Soo Young - Always wanted to see a show Soo Young's in, and she did not disappoint! This drama was fluffy and warm and only 4 episodes, I finished in one seating. \n\n**Crash Course In Romance:** 9) well-known supporting actor; there we many of them! e.g. Lee Boo Ryun, Oh Eui Shin, Jang Young Nam - This was not quite the romantic comedy I expected, I think the Korean title *One Shot Scandal* may be more apt. It was stressful watching the mothers in this show, also did not enjoy the &gt;!murder!&lt; side plot. It was just not what I expected. Loved the interaction between the teenagers though. Also especially enjoyed Jung Kyung-Ho and Ron Yoon Seo\u2019s acting.\n\n**I\u2019m Not A Robot:** 21) disguises or false identities - This was the fluff that I needed to balance all the stress I was feeling from Crash Course in Romance. The premise of it was outlandish but the chemistry and great acting by the ML &amp; FL made it easy to suspend disbelief.\n\n**Do You Like Brahms? :** Challenge TBD - I liked this, although the pacing was slow. It was delightful to see two introverts in a relationship represented in a drama and their character development. I also like how ML &amp; FL communicated maturely and respected each other\u2019s boundaries.\n\n**In Progress**\n\n**Dr Romantic 3 \\[8/16\\]:** Challenge TBD - Enjoying it so far but not as much as the second season.\n\n**My Father Is Strange \\[7/52\\]:** 33) Long-form drama - My first ever long-form drama, so far so good.\n\n**Our Beloved Summer \\[6/16\\]:** 14) OST nominated for MAMA; Christmas Tree by V &amp; Drawer by 10cm - Loving this! Can\u2019t decide whether to binge it or savour it slowly.\n\n**Sungkyunkwan Scandal \\[4/20\\]:** 35) At least 10 years old - Looking forward to seeing how it unfolds\n\n**Start-Up \\[7/16\\]:** Challenge TBD - Am not feeling very captivated by this, I might try another episode or two before deciding whether to drop it.\n\n**Vincenzo \\[11/20\\]:** Was hoping to use this for 22) character seeking revenge - Started this back in Jan but it is getting way too intense for me and I haven\u2019t seen any episodes all of May. Recommendations welcome for a less intense drama that fulfils the revenge challenge.\n\nEdit: grammar and formatting",

I enjoyed **Taxi Driver** because they are getting revenge/justice for other people, mostly in two episodes per story. Although how they punished some of their victims was off putting until that was resolved. Season 2 was lighter.",

            "comment": "I'm late today because for some reason my brain decided that the check-in is coming up on the first of the next month and not the last of the actual month (yeah it makes no sense), anyway let's see how May was for me challenge-wise:\n\nHere is [my challenge list](https://mydramalist.com/list/4Ko6PyX4)\n\nI have reached a serious slump in my kdrama watching, I have realized it after I forced myself to watch One Spring Night despite not feeling like watching and somehow making a drama I was really excited about watching into a chore\u2026 so I will be definitely taking a break next month. I\u2019m considering finishing the two dramas on my cw and calling it a day at dedicated watcher level or getting rid of some of my extra rules, but for now it\u2019s a break.\r\n\nIn May I have completed:\r\n\n* *#5 A drama chosen by the Wheel of Chance: Tropes (It's so pretty!' - 'Yes, (you are).'):* **Twenty-Five Twenty-One** \r\n* *#9 A drama starring a well-known supporting actor:* **Perfume** \\- I enjoyed this one, good romance, good comedy, and stellar use of the childhood-connection trope\r\n* *#19 A drama with minimal or no romance:* **D.P.**\r\n* *#27 A drama found by searching existing recommendations:* **One Spring Night** \r\n\nI\u2019m currently watching:\r\n\n* *#13 A drama where two of the main or support cast have been co-stars on multiple occasions:* **Tale of the Nine-Tailed 1938** (8/12) - since the limitations don\u2019t say that sequels and spin-offs are off-limits for this challenge, I have decided to watch this; and so far it's good, I really liked last week's episodes\r\n* *#18 A drama with a dream interpretation:* **Apple of My Eye** (47/120) - we hit a slow and frustrating part of the series (let's just say some people need to get punched) but I have hopes for this week \n\n\r  \nMy plan for June is to watch cdramas and jdramas, and mayyyybe at the end try **The Killer's Shopping List** (#15)",

I had family staying and other things happen that just meant there wasn't that much time to watch drama for most of the month. I feel like I watched the most in the last week.\n\n**Completed:**\n\n**Joseon Lawyer - A Morality** \\- 16/16 (Challenge #26 A drama from a screenwriter or director whose works you have previously enjoyed)\n\nOh man I was absolutely loving this up until the last 3-4 eps. I decided to wait to finish the last 4 eps at once and I am so glad I made that decision. I did like this in the end, but it was so sad near the end.\n\n**Drama Special Season 8: Slow (2017)** (Challenge #34 A drama with less than 500 watchers on MDL)\n\nNo idea how I track the number of viewers for this? Do I need a screenshot of it being under 500? Or if it goes over 500 does it no longer count? It had 475 when I watched it. Kwak Dongyeon is soo good in every role. It felt like I was watching a documentary about a real person. It was a little somber but I kinda wish it was longer.\n\n**Soundtrack #1** \\- (Challenge #28 A drama inspired by a review, recommendation or comment on r/KDRAMA or r/kdramarecommends)\n\nI was looking for something to fit this challenge... and I happened across [this review](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/11hkck1/soundtrack_1_a_little_gem_you_may_have_missed/). The drama has been on my radar for a while but I wasn't really in the mood for something like it. I had the urge to watch something light (have been watching too many intense dramas lately) so I watched it. I really enjoyed it.\n\n**Secret Romantic Guest House** \\- (Challenge #23 A drama with at least one animal pet)\n\nI guess historical dramas are my favourite thing. I waited until this was almost finished before I started watching it. I enjoyed it a lot more but I kinda wish the ending had been a little different.\n\n**Bora! Deborah (True to love)** \\- (Challenge #18 A drama with a dream interpretation)\n\nI decided to change the challenge for this one. Man I was expecting a 16 ep drama and was gutted to find out it was only 14. It was so much fun... I guess I really was in the mood for light/fun dramas.\n\n**The Sound of magic** \\- (Challenge #7.c A drama chosen by the Wheel of Chance: Locations - School)\n\nI literally have had a tab on my pc with this drama open since it aired. I honestly don't know why I just didn't watch it. But I am glad I waited. It was a bit darker than I expected but seeing Ji Chang Wook playing a semi light hearted character and singing was just what I needed.\n\n**Drama Special Season 8: A Bad Family (2017)** \\- (Challenge #32 A single episode drama)\n\nAfter watching \"Slow\" this just popped up on my youtube, and I clicked on it at some stage and had it open in another tab. I am so glad I just clicked on it. It made me laugh so much. Was so hilarious and fun.\n\nTotal Completed 20/36.\n\n**Ongoing:**\n\nAll my ongoing dramas are being watched slowly... I am enjoying all of them. Just for one reason or another haven't been in the mood for the particular dramas.\n\n**The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim** \\- 8/12 - (Challenge #1 A drama that has one or more tropes that are used in The Heirs)I keep saving this for when I need a short drama except then I never have time to watch it.\n\n**Romantic Doctor Kim** \\- 3/20 - (Challenge #27 A drama found by searching existing recommendations)This drama popped up on my personalised mydramalist recommendations and I kept ignoring it and scrolling through the recommendations. But then I decided to give it a watch. I'm not that keen on medical dramas... so I'm watching it slowly.\n\n**Warrior Baek Dong Soo** \\- 3/29 - (Challenge #35 A drama that is at least 10 years old)I tried to watch this once before and dropped it. I am enjoying it a lot more this time around but taking it slowly.\n\nI'm in something of a drama slump at the moment. Idk why exactly... so I find myself turning to rewatch older dramas that I have already seen. Hopefully I start some new ones in June and finish the ones in my ongoing list. It's a long weekend this weekend so I'll probably end up watching one of the ongoing dramas... just not sure which yet.\n\nMy [mydramalist](https://mydramalist.com/list/1dObl9d4) list is here... not that I am that good at updating it.",

More on the mystery drama side of things than the makjang side, fwiw.\n\n**Currently watching**:\n\n**Tale of the Nine-Tailed 1938 (2/12)**: I fell behind on this but the first two episodes were soooo fun, I'm very excited to catch up!!

            "comment": "I've watched 19 dramas so far; categories are somewhat fluid as many dramas fulfill several challenges. In May, I finished:\n\n**Seven First Kisses**. I'm probably going to use this for #1, a trope from the Heirs--arranged marraige, but it fits several other categories, including #11--both Lee Min-ho and Park Hae-jin won Baeksang for best new actor), #12--EXO's Kai and 2PM's Taecyon). \n\n*Brief Review:* This drama was short, but very cute. An easy watch with a cast full of hotties.\n\n**Moment at Eighteen.** This can fill so many of the categories (it has several tropes from the Heirs, for instance), but I'm going to use it for either #8, a lead who started as a child actor, or #17--alma mater is a plot point. \n\n*Brief Review:* This was a 10/10 for me. It's a high school romance with slice of life aspects and social commentary. I described it as a cross between **Sky Castle**, the **Reply** series, and **Do You Like Brahms?** Beautifully filmed, affecting. Addresses serious topics. Though the main couple are teens, they show remarkable maturity in how they handle various issues.\n\n**Mr. Sunshine.** Planning to use this for either #14-- OST was MAMA nominated--or for a drama I've been putting off watching. I've put this off since 2020 when I first started watching kdramas.  \n\n*Brief Review:* This drama really crept up on me. For the first 14 or so episodes, even though I could appreciate the artistry of the movie, I didn't find it compelling. I'd watch an episode and come back to the drama a week later; if I watched it sooner it was in an attempt to get through the challenge. But around episode 14, I really began to better understand what was happening and became invested in the characters. I found this drama very moving. It's probably a 9 or 9.5 out of 10 because of the slow start.\n\nIn progress:\n\n**Bo Ra Deborah**\\--for challenge 11. Yoo In-na won Baeksang Artist award for best new actress. Liking this one so far, though I'm surprised by &gt;!how long the FL has been mourning her breakup. !&lt;\n\n**Suspicious Housekeeper--**I may use this for #35, a drama at least 10 years old. I had watched **9 Ends, Two Outs** for that but I might move that one to another category (either #20--character is an athlete, or #18--dream interpretation).\n\nPlan to watch in June: **Hotel Del Luna** (a drama by a screenwriter I've liked).  \n\n\nI haven't yet picked dramas to fit the following categories, so I welcome any suggestions\n\n* minimal or no romance\n* trope--interclass romance\n* drama where actors have been co-stars before\n\nIf you don't have any ideas for those three categories, I still need\n\n* a drama suggested by a KDC participant, LOL!",

Still, I'll throw in another one - **Bad and Crazy**: A police officer, Ryu Su Yeol (Lee Dong Wook) is involved in unethical practices but his life gets upended by the mysterious and righteous 'hero' named K. A great plotline, lots of action and humor, crime-fighting, and I love it! It also fits minimal romance.",

I'm sure it's not very violent by many standards, but it's too much for this wimp. I do love Lee Dong Wook, but I'm afraid I'll have to try something else.\n\nSorry! Thanks for taking the time to make the recommendation. I probably should have said that I can't handle violence.",

Hopefully I\u2019ll get past that this month! \n\n**Completed**\n\n**The Forbidden Marriage** - (challenge TBD) - I really enjoyed this short sageuk. Tried hard to hit the same notes comedically as Mr. Queen. I haven\u2019t had a chance to think about where to put it yet. \n\n**Black Knight** - challenge 19 - I found this kinda unsatisfying overall. I thought woo bin was the perfect choice for 5-8. Episode 3 was really enjoyable and well paced but the rest of the story fell a bit flat.\n \n**Family: The Unbreakable Bond** - challenge 13 (jang hyuk and jang nara) - u/moktailhrs did try to warn us but I went ahead and watched it when it came on D+. Started off as a hot mess, got better but didn't really know what it wanted to be. Overall, okay but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\n\n**Divorce Attorney Shin** - challenge 23 (ramen shop tortoise) - I loved this a lot. I needed this drama friend squad in my life. \n\n**In Progress**\n\n**Start Up** (12/16) - challenge 14 (Gaho \u201cRunning\u201d) - Everything was going well and then the last few episodes the sound and the mouths and the subtitles have been all over the shop. It\u2019s just like watching badly timed fan subbed J-dramas. I don\u2019t remember this being a problem the first time around and it really isn\u2019t adding to the experience. NETFLIX!  \n\n**Kill Me Heal Me** (9/16) - challenge 1 (two mummies) - Not super into it. But that\u2019s probably just my mood. \n\n**Dr. Romantic 3** (10/16) - challenge 26 - Enjoying it but definitely going to be in last place of the trilogy ratings.\n\n**Up Next**\nWe\u2019ll see where the wind takes me this month, I have no idea what I am in the mood for.\n\n\n**Previously**\n\n[**January Check In**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/10pqum7/comment/j6lwj83/)\n\n**Dr. Park\u2019s Clinic** - #18 dream interpretation \n\n**Under The Queen\u2019s Umbrella** - #4 WoC Food: Kimchi - (episode 16) \n\n**Run On** - #6 WoC PPL; Sportswear \n\n[**February Check In**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/11dyi35/comment/jabo12i/)\n\n**Kairos** - Challenge 8 (Lee Se Young)\n\n[**March Check In**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/127fuw4/comment/jee5pzq/)\n\n**Crash Course In Romance**- Challenge 16 (Jung Kyung Ho) \n\n**Doctor Stranger** - Challenge 24 \n\n**Unlock My Boss** - Challenge 29 (recommended by u/LcLou02) \n\n**The Glory** - Challenge 22 (Revenge) \n\n[**April Check In**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/133brvu/comment/ji99r8h/)\n\n**Twenty Five Twenty One** - Challenge #20 athlete main character\n\n**Our Blooming Youth** - Challenge 21 (Disguise/False Identity) \n\n**Love Is For Suckers** (13/16) - Challenge 12 (Choi SiWon of Super Junior)\n\n**Trot Lovers** - Challenge 11 (Ji Eun Ji) \n\n**The Eighth Sense** - Challenge 25 (poster)",

I have once again started another torrid love affair with Cdramas. The quality has really improved and I like that the on air dramas release everyday, so it's easy for me to watch and follow. The weekly kdrama wait is killing me (looking at you The Real has Come!). I also found time to watch Queen Charlotte, if you haven't yet please do - it was great. My only complaint is that it's too short! Netflix - you could have done 10 episodes.\n\nI've dropped some dramas so I haven't added much to my progress. Current status: 12/24 Completed  \nMy Current Watch List:  \nChallenge 4. - One Day Off So I've tentatively put this drama here as I have full confidence that she going to go somewhere and eat Hoe(sashami). From what I've seen so far when she travels she always tries the local food so I'm hoping for a sashami scene.   \nChallenge 15. - Dr. Cha still loving this but to me it feel like they &gt;!took too long to give Cha her freedom. I wish she ditched the husband sooner!&lt;   \nChallenge 18. - The Real Has Come! Love is in the air!\n\nChallenge 20. - The Good Bad Mother I haven't started this yet but I have every intention of watching it (I think)\n\nChallenge 26. - My Perfect Stranger This is the first time I'm seeing Kim Dong Wook in such an active role (running, chasing bad guys, fist fights) I've seen him in fist fights before but they looked so tame and staged not scrappy like he is now. I have a new crush! I'm thoroughly enjoying this. \n\nChallenge 30. Tale of the Nine Tailed 1938 I wasn't going to watch cause I barely finished the first season but it kept popping up in my IG feed and sure enough the reels hooked me. I had to go and see for myself if it was as good as it looked. It is! Much better writing than the first season.   \nMy Completed Watch List:\n\n  \n**Challenge 02**. - Love to Hate You  \n**Challenge 05.** \\- Hides the boyfriend/girlfriend - Breakup Probation, A Week\n\n**Challenge 06**. - Jewelry - Crash Course In Romance  \nChallenge 08. - Delivery Man  \nChallenge 09. - Kokdu: Season of Deity\n\nChallenge 11. - Stealer The Treasure Keeper   \nChallenge 12. - The Fabulous\n\nChallenge 19. - Black Knight   \nChallenge 21. - Taxi Driver 2  \nChallenge 22. - Call it Love  \nChallenge 25. - Heavenly Idol  \nChallenge 32. - tvN O'PENing Don't Announce Your Husband's Death",

It had funny moments but at times I felt like the story line dragged a bit. I can't even say if I would recommend it tbh. \n\nFor Heavenly idol I think a lot of the negative comments are really about the plot holes and source material. This show was adapted from a webtoon and they changed the story from the original midway which created a lot of plot holes towards the end. I went in with zero expectations so I enjoyed it and was probably more forgiving than others. But it really depends on the viewer on whether they need fluff pieces to be 'ground breaking'. It's fluff so can't really expect to much can you.",

Its not as good as Semantic Error but still an enjoyable watch. \n\nBecause I could put **To My Stars** in #1, I shifted **Crash Course in Romance** to #2 subverting a trope (FL picks up ML), then shifted **Love to Hate You** to #6 PPL for Sportswear.\n\n**Find me in Your Memory** \\- *#3 drama ref in another*: The main couple showed up in Shooting Stars. I really enjoyed this show, the main couple had chemistry. It dragged a little bit at the end but still good. \n\n**Bora Deborah / True to Love** \\- *#12 current member of Kpop group*: The ex-boyfriend is a member of 2PM. I actually really liked this show until Eps 13-14. I did not like the last two eps and the way the plot unfolded for all of the characters. Overall I would say recommend watching it cause eps 1-12 were enjoyable. \n\n**Scripting Your Destiny** \\- *#18 dream interpretation*: The BF and the mom talk about tiger dreams. I actually like this short drama even though again the ending wasn't my favorite \n\nNot liking endings seems to be a theme for me. \n\n**Our Blooming Youth** \\- *#21 false identities*: I really liked this show but its a romance second and palace politics first kind of drama. It was still enjoyable, but I was disappointed we didn't get more from the main couple as a couple in love. \n\n\r\r  \n**Currently Watching:**\r  \n\r  \nI don't have a lot of free time in June so I don't know how many of these I will get done\n\n**One Day Off** \\- I am really enjoying this show. I will prob stick it in #19 for a show with minimal to no romance. \n\n**Race** \\- either #16 shares zodiac sign (Libra) or #17 where alma mater is a plot point. So far I am liking this drama and I like that its a short drama at only 12 episodes\n\n**Tale of the Nine tailed 1938** \\- this would be for #10 drama with an actor from my first drama  (BOF - Kim Bum). I dropped the first season of this drama because I did not like the FL or the romance aspect. I was WAY more interested in the brother relationship and the supporting characters. This season seems to have taken all the parts that I liked and doubled down on them. I am actually loving this season. \n\n**Oh Young Shim** \\- either #16 shares zodiac sign (Libra) or #31 for less than 2% viewership\n\n**Meant to Be** \\- This a currently airing daily drama that I am using as my long form drama. However its a 50-50 chance of me sticking with this one. \n\n**My Perfect Stranger** \\- I am not sure where to put this, but I am loving this show so far. \n\n**The Good Bad Mother** \\- #23 for pets - Lion the pig\n\n**The Real Has Come** \\- not sure yet. It would fit some currently filled ones but then I could shift those, so we'll see\n\n**Call it Love** \\- I have been putting off finishing this, but I need to circle back. This is for #4 Food for Sundae. \n\nStarting in June: Bloodhounds, See you in my 19th Life, King the Land, Numbers, and Heartbeat....I will prob start all of these but I doubt I will keep all of them.",

I'm trying to find another \"it\" drama...all the angsty, heartbreaky stuff that I love and it's been super miss with almost no hits the last couple of months.  \n\nKdrama challenge progress list:  [My Kdrama Challenge List](https://mydramalist.com/list/3DgbrzPL)\n\nHopefully I'll soon find another My Mister / Lost / My Liberation Notes / Love Affairs in the Afternoon soon or another Reflection of You.  In the meantime I did watch several dramas this month not on the challenge that were not my ansty type of show but that I did overall find okay.  Joseon Attorney was awesome for Woo Do Hwan and the supporting characters but it is always distracting one a 'main character' is not able to emote and dulls down the story for me.   I've been dropping / putting several on hold as well.  With the amount of dramas I've seen, I am running out of patience for lack of creativity in writing I think.   There is only so many times I can watch the same 'blame the victim, excuse / lie for the abuser' narrative before it just becomes annoying and ruins for me what could be a potentially good show (looking at you Trolley).",

            "comment": "Completed in May:\n\n**Forbidden Marriage**: To escape imprisonment and end the 7 year nation-wide ban on marriage, FL pretends to channel the spirit of the dead crown princess and convince the king to remarry. A fun rom-com set in a Joseon-like universe where everything is beautiful and they aren't worried about being historically accurate. Similar to A Knights Tale or Ever Afer, with some detective elements. The tone wavered a little between jokey and serious, but the pacing was generally good.  I'm glad they let us down easy with the SML syndrome. I give it a 9/10 for looks (sets, costumes, and cast!), pacing, and personal enjoyment. I'm using this for my drama featuring disguises or false identities (challenge 21).\n\n**Challenges**: **1** (Excessive Wrist Grabs)**, 11** (Park Ju Hyun)**, 21**. Tropes: technically rich/poor couple. Locations: park, palace. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Trot Lovers:** A girl becomes a Trot singer to pay off the loan sharks after her missing father. Her love interests are, of course, her reluctant manager who's music career was ruined by a scandal, and the brand new President of the entertainment company she signed with. Her rival is another young singer that is threatened by the FL's success.\n\nThis was everything I wanted for a wacky, hopeful, fun, young love romcom. Lots of fun music. It had a great love square where I loved everyone and the \"evil\" SFL never stood a chance. I fell completely in love with Jang Joon Hyun in the first half of this drama, and I never love kdrama leading guys. Of course SML played by Shin Sung Rok, was lovable too. \rEverything is perfect until the classic midseason Dramatic Turn of Events followed by Bottomless Pools of Angst.  The way everything happened with the Dramatic Event was too unbelievable for me to get past and it soured my enjoyment of the rest of the show.  10/10 pre-accident. 7/10 post accident. Overall I would give it an 8/10 because I liked most of it but am not anxious to watch it again. Right now I'm using this for Challenge 12: drama staring an actor who is a member of a kpop group (Jung Eun Ji from Apink).\n\n**Challenges: 4, 8** (Lee Se Young)**, 11** (Jung Eun Ji)**, 12, 13** (SML/SFL in Kairos)**, 26** (Law Cafe/Sassy Go Go director)**, 27 (**[rec here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramarecommends/comments/u33ema/kdramas_where_the_main_character_is_a_former_idol/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)), **36** (last year's missed the last boat/only one room trope that I had such a hard time with). **Food**: triangle kimbap, sundae, jajangmyeon, patbingsu, ttoekbokki. **Trope**: hide the SO, amnesia, study abroad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n**Thank You** (5/16): A Jang Hyuk and Gong Hyo Jin drama from 2007 set on a rural island. Gong Hyo Jin's chracter's background and situation is very similar to her character in **When the Camelia Blooms**. I am loving the rural setting but I foresee a lot of melodrama ahead.\n\n**My Father is Strange** (49/52): It is taking all of my willpower to finish this one. The Big Reveal was very dramatic, and not in a fun way. I'm hoping the last few episodes are really good because everyone raves about this drama.",

It\u2019s funny and romantic at times. It snuck into my top 10, which is surprising because most of my top 10 is made of dramas I watched awhile ago. \n\n- challenge #8 (former child actor - moon ga-young): welcome to Waikiki 2. \n\nSimilar in humor to s1, but not as good overall. Still solid though. \n\n- challenge #31 (less than 2% rating): bora Deborah. \n\nI\u2019m surprised more people didn\u2019t watch it. I really liked bora and enjoyed the drama for the most part. However, I disliked all the other couples but not enough to be a dealbreaker. \n\nIn progress: \n\n- challenge #13 (costars multiple times): delightfully deceitful (1/16)\n\n- challenge 16 (zodiac): my perfect stranger (10/16)\n\nI\u2019m really enjoying this and I dont know why. i look forward to it every week. \n\n- challenge #23 (pet): good bad mother. (1/16)\n\n- challenge #3 (referenced in another drama): be melodramatic (2/16)\n\n- challenge #24 (wanted to watch): kiss sixth sense (1/16)\n\n- challenge #33 (long form): dr romantic s1 (8/20)\n\n- challenge #35 (old): I hear your voice (4/18). I would have quit this already if it wasn\u2019t for agreeing to watch this for a fellow redditor. It\u2019s not bad, but it\u2019s a little dated and it\u2019s driving me a little crazy. \n\nWill pick up: \n\n- challenge #25 (poster): heartbeat\n\n- challenge #12 (idol): king the land\n\nDid you pick up on my theme of new dramas?

Also, my May happened to be a month of historical dramas and Lee Se Young (and historical dramas starring Lee Se Young)\n\n24 dramas in total!\n\n**Complete:**\n\n\\- **The Red Sleeve** \\- it was really good drama! Great love, tragic life, as we love it. It was refreshing in many ways, including much screen time after &gt;!FL's death, I liked that they shown how her absence affected many people and what life looked like afterwards.!&lt;\n\n\\- **KBS Drama Special: If We Were a Season** \\- touching story about first love and friendship. I liked the ending, &gt;!open one and promising.!&lt;\n\n\\- **The Crowned Clown** \\- it's a remake of 2012 film, \"Masquerade\", which I liked, so I decided to watch the drama version too. They turned out to be absolutely different things but it was the good drama and I liked it.\n\n\\- **KBS Drama Special: The Effect of a Finger Flick on a Breakup** \\- looked like realistic thing, very annoying ML. Not sure if I want to include it in my challenge.\n\n\\- **KBS Drama Special: Socialization \u2013 Understanding of Dance** \\- I liked it! Story of two insecure people who supported each other. It was awkward but cute in its own way.\n\n\\- **Memorist** \\- my 3rd attempt to watch this drama. It wasn't bad but I wouldn't miss anything without watching it. At some point it started to feel like plot twists exist for plot twist's sake. Though I liked interaction between leads and interaction between ML and his team.\n\n\\- **Youth of May** \\- finally I watched it! Another tragic but beautiful story. I hated that I spoiled myself ending and couldn't just enjoyed first 11 episodes... It cried throughout final... I liked how they shown in the end both adult and young versions of the same characters, btw, like all those years vanished.\n\nIt's interesting that I started and finished the month with similar stories (similar vibes) but watching TRS I couldn't cry even if I wanted and I cried like a baby during YoM\n\n**In progress:**\n\nLove All Play (8/16)\n\nDong Yi (38/60)\n\nCall It Love (10/16)",

What I can remember (and properly identify) are the Starbucks capsules they were making in the side dish shop. I have intended the show for a different prompt but this will stay here for now. Also, I didn't expect to fall in love with this show so much....what??!?!?!\n\n8\\] A drama with a main lead that started off as a child actor\n\n* ***Love in the Moonlight*** \\- I had parked this show for a number of months but this prompt motivated me to finish it because Kim Yoo-jung is my poster Korean child actor.\n\n19\\] A drama with minimal or no romance\n\n* ***Black Knight*** \\- It's a relief to know all those cigarettes were just CGI!\n\n23\\] A drama with at least one animal pet\n\n* ***Alchemy of Souls 2*** \\- I watched this show earlier this year and thought I would never be able to tag it for a certain prompt. I just happened to skim it again because I thought there was a scene that would meet one of the challenge prompts. It's funny that I never got that confirmed but instead saw again that the Crown Prince's pet turtle would fit right here. And saw that Lee Chae-min (Seon-jae in *Crash Course*...) was the alcohol deliveryman in the first ep!\n\n26\\] A drama from a screenwriter or director whose works you have previously enjoyed\n\n* ***Hospital Playlist 2*** \\- Well, I just loved this entire series and I'm here for the rumored prequel.\n\n34\\] A drama with less than 500 watchers on MDL\n\n* ***Beginning*** \\- I found this as one of the more difficult themes so wanted to make sure to get this out of the way the soonest. The show turned out to be surprisingly okay for a web series and I really wanted more because I thought there were more to the the different storylines. The female cast are members of Kpop cover group, ARTBEAT. I was MDL watcher number 208 as of May 17.\n\nSo that's a total of six shows making my current total at fifteen! I might be able to finish the entire challenge sooner if only Cdramas don't keep calling my name. Hahahaha!",

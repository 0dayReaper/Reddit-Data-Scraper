He played for the clubs Juventus and AC Milan as well as the Italian national team.\n\nHe was a great footballer. He has the most hat-tricks in the Italian Serie A league (10) and 5th most European club competition goals (behind Lewandowski, Raul, Messi, and C. Ronaldo).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Inzaghi\n\nedit: after watching 25 minutes of Inzaghi highlights (I'm kind of a football fan lol), there's some interesting parallels between the soccer player and Vincenzo.\n\nInzaghi isn't the most technically gifted player. Many times his first touch is not great. But, he is able to react quicker than his opponent. He immediately steals the ball back then can see exactly where to put the ball to score. I see Vincenzo with similar strengths/weaknesses. Vincenzo isn't the best marksman, expert in Korean law, or understanding of Korean culture in general. But, he is very good at reacting to his opponents. If he let's the opponent get the ball back, he'll know exactly how to react to take advantage for his own goal. I'm speaking in generalities, so I'll have to follow up with a full post to compare/contrast the styles.",

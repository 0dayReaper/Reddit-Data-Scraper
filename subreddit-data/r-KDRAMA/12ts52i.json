Last night, I watched Episodes 16 &amp; 17 of **Our Blues**, and just when I thought there had to be a drop-off in the quality of the storylines, along came six-year-old Ki So-yu with her astounding performance as Eun-gi.\n\nI think the secret is that, in K-dramas, kids are allowed to be kids. Whenever I've watched a child actor performance in a movie or TV series that didn't impress me, the reason tends to be that it came across as overly precocious. I rarely find this to be the case in K-dramas.\n\nIn addition, Ki So-yu was entrusted with lengthy scenes with only her grandmother (played by Go Doo-shim) for company. The bravery of the director in entrusting her with such responsibility, and the naturalism with which Ki So-yu pulled off her role was deeply impressive.",

                    "comment": "While portrayals vary drama to drama, I think one of my favorite things about kdramas is how the *feelings* of kids is focused on in dramas, especially the range of different emotions they feel -- including times when they feel conflicting things (like simultaneously feeling disappointed in a parent figure for doing something bad while still loving them because they are their parent).\n\nI don't have a point of comparison as I essentially haven't watched any American TV (western media) in over a decade but I just feel that it's nice to see kids being acknowledged as emotionally 'complex' -- if that makes sense? Like I feel sometimes kids are seen as capable of feeling only one emotion at a time and so they get infantilized and ignored because they seem \"simple\" when they are anything *but*. It's not that they are precocious, just that they feel 'alive' as themselves rather than a puppet being operated by adult figures.",

I also don\u2019t have any recent reference points in Western film or television, but I think the treatment of the kids\u2019 characters in K-dramas is a key difference.",

I have a low-key crush on Jinyoung and the 10yo actress is so adorable and lively so the episode was such a cute watch \ud83d\ude2d\n\n(btw, Eid Mubarak if you celebrate!)",

But it's not strictly dependent on whether they have grey hair or not (though hair can be a good visual clue), it depends on the age of the person speaking too.\n\nBasically the speaker would choose a term based on how many generations they are away from the person they are addressing.\n\nSo like I would address a seventy year old elderly man as *haraboji* because he would be in the age range of a grandparent relative to my age. In contrast, someone in their 60s, I'd address as ahjusshi/uncle because their age range is only one generation ahead of me. But that same man in their 60s would be called *haraboji* by my nephews (10 year olds) because to them, they'd be grandparent generation.\n\nMeanwhile, both the 60s and 70s man can be grey-hair-less because some genetics are like that.\n\nCan't think of a specific drama right now (and maybe this happens more often in variety shows) but when parents are out with young kids and come across an elderly person, when talking to the kid, the elderly person will be addressed as *haraboji/halmoni* (eg. 'say thank you to halmoni for the candy') but when the parent talks ***directly*** to the elderly person, they may use *abonim* or *omonim* (eg. 'omonim, thank you for giving little puppy the candy'). Which I guess goes to the fact that even 'abonim' and 'omonim' can be repurposed as more general terms of address when it comes to the elderly.\n\nSo yeah, grey hair can be a helpful visual clue but isn't definitive at all.",

                            "comment": "So I was wrong: It is not necessary to actually have kids to be called Abonim/Omonim, it is just me who haven't noticed it used that way. It is very complicated when every word you use to address someone depends on the situation and on your position relative to the person. I suppose I would have learnt it if I had been brought up there.\n\nThat I wrote grey hair was just a metaphor for \"looking old\". My aunt had completely white hair since she was around forty. \n\nThank you for in-depth answer as usual.",

Now that I am also past fifty, it does feel easier to call my eighty year old neighbour by his first name. Sometimes I want to talk to him and call him from the outside. \n\nNot sure of young people today, possibly it is easier for them since they grow up using first name on teachers. We said \"Mrs *Family name*\". At the same time, I don't want to be addressed with my family name, because I don't really feel connected to it. I didn't change it when I married, but that was mostly because I liked a bit of stability and for people to be able to find me. \n\nToday also customer service in many companies use first name right away for their customers, which sometimes feels very strange. \n\nI heard that in Sweden they have started to take up again using \"Ni\", the polite form of \"you\", to strangers. That doesn't seem to be the case here. Fun how two close countries can develop differently. Usually we get so many loan words from Swedish and there are so many Swedes working in Norway, so it might start here too.\n\nIn the Andes there are areas where people use the polite form to their close family. \"You should respect close family\".",

            "comment": "Memoir of a Murderer review Part 2:\n\nSo I just found it again to watch with a friend who wanted to see it, and it turns out there are at least two versions of this movie out there. I do not like this second one at all.\n\nThe one I saw first was about 1 hour 58 minutes. I went and found the version I had seen to get the time differences for this review. This second one is about 2 hours and 7 minutes long.\n\nIt is edited very differently, and about 20 minutes in it makes clear who the villain is, which is a terrible mistake. The 2 hour version makes you feel uncertain until about halfway through, and even then, because of a main character's severe memory problems and hallucinations, you aren't quite sure what is going on for awhile longer.\n\nSo the two hour version keeps you on the edge of your seat, so much uncertainty and fear in the atmosphere, in various characters, and in YOU, the viewer, that it's wonderful.\n\nThe longer version, in my opinion, tells you too quickly what is going on and just simply tells the story of what happened. Snooze.....\n\nSince there was very little tension and uncertainty in the longer version, I was deeply disappointed because I had seen the better edited version first.    \n\nThere are, of course, extra scenes included in the longer version, but not, in my opinion, for the better.\n\nI highly recommend you watch the 2 hour version.  It's so good.",

It\u2019s refreshing to watch something without a murder plot lol. I recently finished **The Glory** and started **Flower of Evil**, so it\u2019s a nice change to watch a comedy. It\u2019s currently half past midnight and I think I will binge until 3 am or something\u2026 love this show so far!",

One thing that's interesting is that most people in this subreddit never comment, and another chunk comment rarely. Which means that the perception that there's a consensus of opinion about various shows and so on is only based on the few who do comment often, and not representative of widespread opinion. This is good to remember.",

This is approximately the numbers for upvoting that I see when I have written posts, when reddit makes the \"how many have seen your post\" available. Picture joke posts gets more upvotes because they are quicker to look at.\n\nThere is also a crowd pressure thing that is very real: Someone starts voting, and many more will follow the leader. And definitely also a difficulty in going against what other people have said: So if the first ten people write X, it is hard to come as the eleventh and write Y.\n\nBut sometimes you see a very curious thing: Mr A is upvoted a lot for writing X, but then lower down in the thread Mr B is downvoted for writing the exact same thing with other words. I don't know if this is me who read things differently, and other people don't see them as writing the same thing, but I have been thinking that maybe it simply has to do with demographics and who looks at the post at this time of the day compared to that time of the day, and which comments will be shown on top. I don't know. \n\nThere is a sub called r/TheoryOfReddit with sometimes very interesting discussions.",

After starting K-dramas, I actually had a C-drama phase in between but went back to K-dramas in around 2019. I think I watched the most in 2020-2022, but now I'm also watching at least 1 K-drama at a time. I usually like to watch completed K-dramas since I am impatient, so I pay less attention to the year (but I thoroughly enjoyed on-air discussions for **Little Women**, **Under the Queen's Umbrella**, and **Reborn Rich**). \n\nLooking at the list, I rated lots of romance dramas highly in 2016 like **Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo**, **Signal**, **Goblin**, **The Legend of the Blue Sea**. 2020 had lots of good especially thrillers like **Extracurricular**, **The Flower of Evil**, **The Good Detective**, **Memorist**, **Nobody Knows**, **Train**, **The King: Eternal Monarch**, **Mr. Queen** (not a thriller, but one of my all-time favorites). I could go on and on for all the other years since I didn't necessarily watch it in the year that it came and I like multiple genres.\n\nAccording to MDL (if I actually entered everything in correctly \ud83d\ude05) , I watched 235 dramas total, with 161 of them being K-dramas. I didn't really keep track of dropped. This was fun to write, so thanks for asking!",

And associate \"turn off your brain\" shows with females?\r\n\r\nYes, romance was originally marketed towards females but I don't think people nowadays actually care about that. Personally, I consume anything (except violence and gore), as long as it is a quality content and entertaining and goes with my current mood. I believe most people are also like that.\r\n\r\nRomance genre does have a bad reputation in literature/entertainment for having comparatively more predictable, insubstantial content and bad storytelling style compared to others. Unless someone, irrespective of gender, is exposed to quality content, I don't really blame them for holding a negative view on them. After all, everyone has different tastes and some gives more importance to good storytelling than fluff and vice versa. Idt anyone is being demeaning when they say that.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, thriller genre has similar bad reputation. They have wider concepts to work with than romance but very rarely produce a perfect work with interesting plot and no apparent plot conveniences or plot holes.  Actually every other genre, except literary fiction, have same problems. But we don't make a fuss about that. \r\n\r\nTurn off your brain shows imo are silly, ridiculous shows, and usually falls under comedy genre. I think anyone looking for lazy entertainment watch these hence the literal wording. Coincidentally, the turn off brain show I am currently watching is male centered. So I really don't see how they are associated with females unless force thinking it. Wonder how many of you actually think so, so please mention.",

I just think romantic love offers a lot of narrative potential and is something that deeply resonates with people. I've also, frequently, gotten crap about this from those (male and female) who find it strange.",

Now I get why this is loved by many and I am one of them now. :) \n\nIt took me a while to get around it but wow it has become one of the best kdramas out there made in 2023. I love how this series is fast-paced, easy to watch coz it\u2019s less than an hour and they didn\u2019t drag the storyline. It\u2019s fitting to have it at 10 episodes only. I wish for more though coz I miss them alreadyyy :( I love the whole cast esp the main leads this is my first time I\u2019ve seen them and they\u2019re so adorable \ud83e\udd79",

It worked relatively well - I have been more consistently watching most of them, rather than focusing on some over others and leaving those ones to languish. One of the problems with this is that I can then lose interest, even if I was enjoying the show.\n\nBut it didn't last for long, because I started watching things in a different order to what I'd planned, and had to keep changing the list. So I've sort of scrapped it and think I'll just go back to watching whatever takes my fancy for that day. Or maybe it will be a mix of both. I still like the idea of getting through the series better. I'll try not to put things off as much.\n\n(I'm one of those people who watches several shows at once - there are about 8, maybe, that I'm actively watching, with a few more on pause).",

The first half of the film was eerily prescient about the self-isolation days of the pandemic. It was also a one-man show, and Yoo Ah-in was more than up to the task of carrying the film. The resourcefulness that his character had to show &gt;!to survive!&lt; was riveting to watch. \n\nPark Shin-hye\u2019s &gt;!badass!&lt; character shows up in the second half. From that point on, it becomes a more generic zombie movie, which was purely a filmmaking decision. Still, it held my interest to the end.",

On the other hand I can see how some of the other things portrayed in the drama can come across as ableist. \n\nI low-key did not know Rowoon is the SML LOL. i was just thinking wow this SML is hella good-looking so looked up the actors on MDL and then I was like oh of course he is good looking if he is Rowoon.

Along with the secretary to ML in **Devilish Joy**, the police team captain in **Hello, Monster** and  Lee Jae Wook's character in **When The weather is fine**. ( I kind of think LJW's character could be classified as a main character actually but still i am using the term support characters very loosely here).\n\n\nEdit: forgot to mention Kim Do Wan's character in **Moment of Eighteen** is also another favourite support character of mine.",

Thoroughly enjoying the latter two. And yeah totally agree that the shorter format is nice to have in the mix vs like a 75-min drama with 16 episodes. But this also allows them to really stick to the romance and developing out the main characters, which I really like. Not bogged down with needless side plots and side characters. \n\nWould recommend the Japanese BL Kieta Hatsukoi. It is very cute and on par with SE.",

Even with its lesser runtime, it still managed to make me feel all sorts of emotions which is exactly what I'm getting with ODS as well. I can't believe we're down to the two last episodes of ODS, I'm DEVASTATED. \n\nAnyways, as a fellow fairly new to the BL world individual, Thai BLs have gems too but it is on the longer side. If you ever are interested in checking them out, I'll recommend My School President but then again, my catalogue of watched BLs are very short so take my recommendations with a grain of salt.

This yr I don't see that kinda hype for any series at all. Taxi Driver, maybe. But I understand it's the second season so I can't count that. With me watching older dramas of 2016-2017 right now I really feel like it's a dry period for dramas",

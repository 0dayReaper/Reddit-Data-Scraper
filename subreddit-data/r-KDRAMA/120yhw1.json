Shin Hye-Sun was remarkable, and her chemistry with every single character was amazing. The laugh out loud moments, the teary eyed moments and the bittersweet ones too. I loved it all around. I will always recommend it now.",

And, by episode 5-6, I was completely hooked.\n\nI still have no idea how they did it, but the writers (and actors) took a seemingly, wholly implausible premise, seamlessly turned it on its head, and with sensational high comedy and edge-of-seat drama, went on to deliver a beautiful story arc and poignant romance that will forever have a place in my heart.",

My nit-picks for Healer are extremely minor, and unlike Prison Playbook, I'm not having any pacing issues.\n\nANYWAY. People are always talking about how this is a great action drama, which, yes, it is. Fight scenes galore, and I love a good fight scene. But why does no one mention how disgustingly cute the romance is? Like, I'm having cavities over here, it's so fluffy. I'm looking forward more to the fluff than the action at this point.\n\nAlso, JCW is just hitting it out of the park. Enjoyed him in K2, loved him in If You Wish Upon Me. He does so well with emotional scenes. You can feel the pain his character is in, and I just love it. I can't believe Healer is TWO YEARS before K2.",

There are some tropes and annoying details sprinkled here and there, and &gt;!the last few episodes were a bit too out there writing-wise!&lt; for my taste, but everything &gt;!fell in place in the last episode!&lt;. In particular, the dialogue &gt;!at the end in the police car about giving attention to your beliefs, wants and needs (they call it subconscious in the show) was really touching!&lt; and basically the takeaway point of the show. Yook Dong-shik is &gt;!good-hearted and, after exploring his dark side, he finally accepts himself at the end!&lt;, even though for me it\u2019s important to highlight, even more than the drama itself did, that assertiveness should not be confused with being a bad or selfish person and people-pleasing is not necessarily a good thing.\n\nI loved Yoon Shi Yoon\u2019s acting here. I had only seen him in You Raise Me Up - a drama that did everything right and everything wrong at the same time, I had to drop it - and he impressed me even more here. What to say about Park Sung-hoon? He is way too convincing ~~and hot~~  when he plays the POS, be it cold or hot-headed, as I\u2019ve seen in The Glory as well. I\u2019m going to watch Into The Ring soon, I think, because I really want to see him finally play a good person lol.",

It could have end up completely ridiculous but somehow it works.\n\nThe leads, especially the ML, are surprisingly touching. it\u2019s a rom com but the side characters are well developed. the leads (and some side characters) have goals on their own to achieve, not just ending up together (like in Fight my Way).\nNot a master piece for sure but it was a nice ride.",

If you like action, don't miss this series.\n\nAlso saw The Scholar Who Walks the Night. I wasn't expecting much from a vampire drama, but was pleasantly surprised by how good this series is. Lee Joon-gi and Lee Soo-hyuk are talented actors and were able to be both scary and sympathetic. The romance between Lee Joon-gi and Lee Yu-bi was well done, maybe a cringe moment or two. Loved the costumes, too.",

            "comment": "**When the Camellia Blooms** (13/20): I like almost everyone but the way ML acts is kind of grating and extremely immature. I wish he was a bit more smooth or suave, especially when he's a police officer. I think he's really only had like one moment of that. I hate the whining he does when something doesn't go his way. It's quite a turn off and the way he talks to Dongbaek when he's jealous seems pretty controlling/insecure. \n\nI like Dongbaek but I thought she would be a stronger FL. But she's cute as a button. It's heartbreaking to always see everyone shit on Dongbaek.   \n\nKJR is kind of a jerk. I don't blame him for wanting to be in &gt;!his son's!&lt; life but everything is always about him and how he feels while disregarding everyone else's feelings. Pil-Gu is phenomenal and I wished he got more screen time. Love that adorable kid and Hyang-mi was starting to grow on me.",

I, too, found him annoying at first, but at the end of the day I was rooting for him to get the girl because of his earnestness and perseverance.  That if this was real, I'd like him to be in my friends circle. He is portraying a \"country\" bumpkin so lack of suaveness can be forgiven.   By the way Kang Ha-neul (Yong-sik) won so many awards for this role, putting on a \"hick\" accent and looks, beating Park Seo-joon (Itaewon Class), Hyun Bin (Crash Landing on You), Ju Ji-hoon (Hyena), and Namgoong Min (Stove League) at the Baeksang Awards, where WTCB won the Grand Prize.\n\nDongbaek appears not to be strong because she knows her \"place\" in a very conservative society, that of unwed single mother owning a bar.  Very taboo in many conservative circles.  But she does stand-up for herself:  she does not buckle under the landlord's crude manner, &gt;! leaves a detached boyfriend with an abusive mother !&lt;  , takes in Hyang-mi, opens up a bar, raises a child by herself.\n\nMy favorite couple is the landlord/lawyer.  &gt;! With all the Kdramas I've seen, Hyang-mi is one of the most tragic characters. !&lt;  I still weep when I think of this show.",

He has such range in his face, and in everything he's been in he is just superb at showing love, humor, kindness, desperation, sadness...just everything he makes you feel keenly. I love his singing voice, as well. \nI also have loved:\n\nSuspicious Partner\n\nLovestruck in the City\n\nThe Sound of Magic\n\nHealer\n\nHe seems to do quality productions with good writing.  Each one of these also has a wonderful female lead and great supporting cast.  The only one I have dropped is Backstreet Rookie. I might pick it up again to try to finish it, especially if someone tells me it gets better.",

I saw more people talk about Tomorrow and Pachinko than this one. It's filled with a very strong cast and deals with the dramatics of the home shopping network(kinda unique focus),evil women and spousal betrayal. \n\nIt feels like it came out 2005. Not visually of course but its such a straight,super easy to follow story. I think I initially dropped it to finish Artificial City which I thoroughly enjoyed despite the ending.\n\nAnyway I'm watching Kill Heel at 1.5x speed because there's still so many dramas I want to finish. If I had to rate this show, I'd give it a 6.5/10. Adding Lee Hye Young to the list of older women I have a crush on.",

This is the themed post for all identification questions and requests, including dramas! \n\nBefore posting in this thread please take a look through our [discussion resources - who/what/which is this section](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/discussionresources#wiki_who.2Fwhat.2Fwhich_is_this.3F) which outlines ways in which you can work out many of these requests for yourself.\n\nYou can ask here for help identifying the following things: Dramas, Actors, Product  Placement (either product or brand), Drama Locations, Clothing,  Accessories, Music (OST or background).\n\nPlease  provide a picture if possible (upload on imgur) and include as much  contextual information as you know (e.g. source drama, broadcast year, episode number and time stamp, etc.).\n\nOnce you have found an answer please edit your original comment to state \"**SOLVED**\" in bold caps at the top so people don't spend time trying to help unnecessarily.\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

I keep hearing a piece that's very very close to Stopped Time from the Vincenzo OST (particularly from the 2:05 mark of the track). \n\nI am loving it, but just curious if it's the same composer or something?",

You can generally check all OST credits for kdramas on their Wiki page \ud83d\ude0a.",

Astute ear maybe, but absolutely rubbish page-skimming skills as I'd been on both wikis and totally missed it in the sidebar. \ud83e\udd23 Thanks for confirming for me. I definitely feel like they went for the Vincenzo vibes on purpose and hired the composer as such. Especially as I'm getting a few more episodes along and the whole Mafia/Catholocism vibes are coming out a bit more.",

I live in Seoul and I was on a walk up Naksan, and I was just about to climb the steps up to Ihwa Mural Village when I saw a film crew filming something. They were outside a little cafe on the mountainside, and there was a ML and a FL. It was a rain scene, so even though it wasn\u2019t raining that evening, they had a machine set up to pour rain over the actors, who both had umbrellas. It was around dusk, so not quite dark yet, and this was in mid-March. The tour guide I was with said he thought he recognised the actress from the Korean Saturday Night Live, but it didn\u2019t seem to be a comedy sketch whatsoever. It may well have not come out yet, but I\u2019m wondering if this was possibly a scene from a K-drama, and if so, if you could help me identify which one? I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have more information - we weren\u2019t allowed to take photos and had to pass through pretty quickly.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve managed to find the exact [location](https://naver.me/FxX6ZKSb) I saw them at, if this helps anyone recognise a scene!",

All i remember was there were a few scenes where the female lead, with blood on their thumb, caressed the male lead's face. and the blood somehow turned into a teardrop birthmark on his face in his next reincarnation. i think the scenes were repeated a few time throughout the drama as it was a reincarnation drama. i think it was released within the past 5 years. is there anyone know might know what drama i'm talking about?",

The grandmother cares a LOT for her granddaughter who seems to be wrapped up in some sort of crime. We sees the cop working on a murder investigation and stops by a church. On the roof of the church is a dead body with a knife stabbed though a uniform. Inside the church, the priest drops a chalice full of the victims blood and a finger(?).\nThe grandmother, who is a housekeeper, ends up getting stabbed in an alleyway. The police officer ends up chasing down the culprit, only to get hit by a car. He loses vision as he looks the culprit in the eyes.\n\nWe think one of the characters (the high school girl) is named Bonnie. Could be wrong. She was doing kickboxing in a previous episode.\nIf anyone has any idea what this is, it would be appreciated! Thank you!",

That feels a bit too obvious, but then again, the creepy smile in the end doesn't leave much room for doubt. \n\n- Hee Seob might be a terrible father in making but I don't for a second think he is the killer. I also love his relationship with Yoon Young. The relationship is abusive on her part, but it is stil sweet to watch how he took this \"orphaned\" kid under his wing and decided to share his fatherly wisdom.\n\n- the funny part is that Hae Joon's \"nagging\" included getting in strangers cars at night. That's why you have to listen to teachers, kids.\n\n- the show does a great job with identity rivals. Actually, the whole sequence about the brother was full of interesting turns.\n\n\n\nEdit : Ep 4\n\n- Soon Ae's parents should let their kid read a book and Oh Bok should prepare his own fried eggs. \n\n- FL's parents are both lovely. Poor dude playing on air guitar his whole life because he can't afford a real one was heartbreaking. \n\n- ML is actually a decent teacher and the kids obviously adore him. I just wish he was nicer to his grandpa.\n\n- FINALLY, the leads are talking. \n\n- the show has good mystery plot. &gt;! My current theory is that Ko Mi Sook used her brother to carry out the murders and later on put all the blame on him. !&lt;",

I don't think he is the murderer - it's too easy, and I actually believe him that he wasn't the murderer. But he is definitely something, and was hiding that for his own purposes. I'm really not sure about that, because wasn't he supposed to kill himself in prison? Or maybe he is the culprit, and we're being misdirected because into thinking it's too easy. 'Hidden in plain sight' kind of thing. But it was a revelation that he's her brother. I think they're both psychos. I wonder what their parents are like... Otherwise, I'm suspicious about him and what he knows about the time travelling. I wonder....\n\n\\- That was cute. She's so pre-disposed to hate him, but he's an innocent, sincere young man here, if silly and a bit self-focused, and she's going to soften and realise that he was once just a teenager, with dreams and so on, and also learn all the things that happened to her parents to make them what they are later on. Their banter is really funny, because they are actually laughably similar. I love seeing them bicker that way, both as though they're teenagers. It's great. And his advice: 'this is what fathers want to teach their kids; if yours didn't, he wanted to, but there were reasons'. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc99\n\n\\- Exactly.",

So it's to do with her manipulation and use of the mother - perhaps because (a) she no longer needs her, since she has her daughter doing the work for her now that the mother used to, and (b) because the mother knows she can't write, and the work is really hers. For some reason, though, the mother doesn't read her books. How have they pushed her towards this? Did Mi/Min Sook do it, originally? In any case, she might not know that Mi/Min Sook has stolen her words, or that they describe real events - and therefore point to her as the culprit. These would be the reasons, I think.",

            "comment": "After Episode 4:\n\n\\- Yoon Yong wants to stop her parents from marrying, because she thinks she and her father are the cause of her mother's misery. And she thinks her mother is miserable. But we keep being shown these scenes of her mother being happy because of her daughter - as a mother, because her daughter is happy or able to do things she wanted to do and wants to give her freedom to do, etc. Family tends to be the cause of both the best and the worst emotions and experiences... Cutting them out doesn't stop the hard things, even if it would take away some of them.\n\n\\- Yoon Yong's dad is actually a decent guy, at least at this stage in his life.\n\n\\- Jae Hoon made breakfast and lunch for Yoon Yong, and told her not to wash the dishes. Later, we see memories where Yoon Yong's mum is washing up and cleaning, and being happy that her daughter is reading, like she used to try to at home. Yoon Yong offers to help, but her mother tells her that she'll have to do these things when she gets married, so she can just relax now and read. Her mother does them for her, so she can do what *she* used to want to do - the thing she loves and is good at. So we see, first, Jae Hoon doing these very things (making the meals and telling her she *doesn't* need to wash the dishes), then these memories where her mum says that. In Yoon Yong's life, she doesn't get to do what she really wants, which is apparently to write. Go Min Sook makes sure she can't, and uses her gifts for herself, as she did with her mother. The implication is that Jae Hoon is the kind of person who would make it possible. \n\n\\- Noticing also how Jae Hoon looks for her and is worried about her safety, over the others', brushes the leaves/dirt off her back, and promises her he'll make sure she's safe. \n\n\\- Go Min Sook (so confusing that her brother is Go Mi Soo or Go Min Soo. These names are way too similar for helping us not get confused) is a mastermind. She controls the bullies - I suspected that last week, and it was confirmed this week - and I think she controls her brother, or at least they have some kind of helping/symbiotic relationship. Although she might not get her own hands practically dirty, I think she's the culprit - at the river, she was watching while the girls bullied Yoon Yong's mother, and came out only when she'd been saved, appearing as someone being kind. But it seems she would have just watched her drown, otherwise. Does she get satisfaction out of watching suffering? \n\n\\- Min Sook said at the author meeting that women 'do these things too'. The way they showed her looking at &gt;!the student teacher, with those words from her book being read, would say that she really thinks like that!&lt;, and is not just writing about it. I've been thinking that she's a murderer from the beginning, actually, before we found out about what's going to happen in the village. It's obvious - crime author is actually a criminal, writing about themselves - but there are several clues about it. I'm not decided yet.\n\n\\- Jae Hoon is making himself into a prime suspect: &gt;!asking to be responsible for the student teacher, giving her his number,!&lt; going around at night looking for things/people, being a bit strange and knowing about stuff that's going to happen... he's sort of doing what he keeps telling Yoon Yong not to do. I'm worried the detective will become more suspicious of him (he already is somewhat), and *Jae Hoon* will be accused. Especially since Min Sook noticed &gt;!that he was worried about Yoon Yong. Maybe she'll accuse him...!&lt;",

He\u2019s her accomplish. \n\nHe\u2019s made to look stupid but I suspect Min Sook seduced him and has him doing the actual murders.",

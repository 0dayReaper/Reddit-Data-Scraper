The hair styling team kicks butt too\u2026\nIf anyone knows the stylist of the show, please let me know. I would wear half of the outfits the FL is wearing and DH exudes class, even when he was wearing that cringy jacket from the Japan episodes. \n\nCW character is so horrible, grey and real, i couldn\u2019t help but love-hate him. Now that DH is supposedly out of the picture, he seems content. Always blaming his misdoings on someone else - DH most of the time. I wonder what his twisted defense mechanism will spit out once he learns of his real biological parents.\n\nI am honestly surprised how quiet the threads of this TV show are. This is some serious quality content, it makes me want to discuss the characters and their motivations.\nIt does have a rather distinct style, I guess it is not up to everyone\u2019s taste, kinda like Tarantino movies are.",

I love San but despite &gt;! being the protagonist,  !&lt; I wish he &gt;! had more layers to his personality other than wanting to take the throne/ wanting to be together with Dan Oh. Like he didn\u2019t even show why he deserves to be king - is it because he cares about the people? I don\u2019t remember seeing any scenes of him showing himself as a good potential king. Or maybe I missed them? In fact I think Yu Ha was closer to a potential king than San from his Mokinhoe leadership (sorry if I spelt it wrong, I\u2019m very sleepy haha) !&lt;\n\nAlso wanna thank Master Jang for always spicing the drama up with &gt;! all his murder schemes. !&lt; everytime I see this actor as the antagonist in shows I know he\u2019s gonna be good. CLOY, Youth of May etc haha",

But the queen mother could act as regent anyway to help him rule. It was more urgent to depose the current king. I guess this is also why he spared Yu Ha and recognized he's more ready to rule than he is. Plus, I think he's smart enough to learn quickly or else he wouldn't have easily topped the state exam. And I think it's a smart tactic to actually have 2 potential heirs instead of just him. I'm quite surprised he thought of this too.",

Why do they act first before coming up with a sound plan?\n\n&gt;!Why didn't they just kill Master Jang?!&lt; He says so himself. He is a strategist. They could have at least caused some damage to the King. It takes only a second to slash someone &gt;!and they could have all escaped!&lt;. \n\nThe King was shot with an arrow to the heart and he recovered while &gt;!Hwa-Ryung just got slashed and died right after!&lt;. The plot armor is really thick. I guess someone has to die for drama.\n\nI totally called it. &gt;!Hwa-Ryung died while protecting Yoo-Ha!&lt;. I knew that the secret would raise red flags.\n\nI really hate that the Queen Dowager is so powerless. I've had my fair share of K-Dramas and in almost all of them, the Queen Dowager is more powerful than the King himself or at least have some power to strategize and do stuff. \n\nPlease give Yoo-Ha a happy ending. He deserve so much better. &gt;!I don't think he would be killed though!&lt;.",

I like the fact that even though Hong Ju and his love were doomed since his past but boy my man delivered beautifully. It was an absolute delight to see him so torn and sacrificing his love to save her the heartbreak. But we all know that won't last obvio. Rooting for my HongShi babies.\n* On the other side, I don't believe for one second &gt;!Si Yeol!&lt; would ever shirk his duties and let Ok-Jin be in danger knowingly.\n* I feel like Kang San and Dan O's story seems to have gotten mellow. However, the jade rings were love and the &gt;!kiss!&lt; was definitely much better than their first. There's a huge possibility that moving forward someone from the two will eventually be in grave danger or on the brink of death to up the stakes so let's see how that goes.\n* The scene with the &gt;!Queen Dowager reuniting with Ok-Jin!&lt; was pretty heartfelt. The way she expressed that he was not at fault is something he probably wanted to hear his whole life. So yeah that was well done.\n* Super glad the animosity between Yu Ha and Kang San is over. I adore their bromance. Also, that scene where &gt;!Si Yeol threatens Yu Ha!&lt; was SO HOT!\n* Really don't care about the bad guys at this point. But of course, the brat &gt;!King!&lt; won't die so easily.",

The only possible question is whether Shi-yeol and Hong Joo have their happy ending but I'm more convinced than ever that they will - their story is epic - lonely people who find love; shadow and ghost (I'm plagiarizing from commenter Monimss (sp?) here on Reddit); twisted fate,   In other words - they have earned it.  \n\nI don't know if the web novel clearly identified Dan-oh and Kang San as the \"couple to be loved above all others\", and it appears that the drama also tries to convey that message, but perhaps casting unintentionally changed the dynamic.",

His character is complex, multi-layered, full of tragedy, racked by guilt and above all - heroic. Other characters are just window-dressing.\n\nEp. 15 did not disappoint. &gt;!I usually hate the \"noble sacrifice\" trope common to romantic k- dramas, but this one was fore-ordained from the beginning if, like me, you believed that Shi-yeol was the original Watchman.  He HAD to walk away from her once he realized he had killed her fiance.  Moreover, he knows that he has put her in danger.  Finally, I don't believe the Ep. 16 preview about the Watchman resigning - it's all for show.!&lt;  Shi-yeol is a hero.",

Whereas,  this woman dies spitting out blood from her organs destroyed within half-hour of a cut to the back. \nIs this king half English cause God really is saving the king?!\n\nI feel bad for Yoo ha: a life of being rejecting by his former family, rejected from the girl he\u2019s in love with, mum dies and now he\u2019s getting tortured for a throne he isn\u2019t even after. Love is usually worth living for but how could he even have a proper happy ending when the girl he loves will be with his half brother. \n\nCurious to see how the ending is going to go down, one must have to die? whether it\u2019s Yoo ha for a bitter sweet ending, who knows?",

The action is good would have liked more. 18 episodes seem like a lot, not sure how we're going to end it but I've come this far.",

I don't even think the actor fits the role. I wish they had written the brothers' meeting a little sooner. I wish the female lead was less bland. I wouldn't risk a throne for her. But we will see. Korean dramas sometimes spoil themselves with blandness and idol time wasting dialogue.",

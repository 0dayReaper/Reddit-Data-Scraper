Would even a slightly better acting performance from ISH (bless her) supported by better character writing have made it better? Yes. \n\nDid I still cry a little in Ep 15 and didn\u2019t ever feel like dropping the show? Also, yes \ud83d\ude48. \n\nI love KJH and bless him, he acted his heart out and looked good while doing it and more importantly looked like he had fun getting to do a meaty dialogue heavy role again, but this plot really did lose me. In so many ways they actually did connect and go back to a lot of things they set up in the first few episodes but it honestly left me confused and only feeling terrible for Kokdu because in both iterations of his life he suffered because of Seoul Hi/Gye Jeol\u2019s inability to let go or come to terms with reality. I can\u2019t blame her, the love of her life was cruelly being taken away from her but I guess the whole chicken and egg, red string of fate of it all is what they were trying to boil it down to. I think the premise itself was entertaining in concept but their execution overall was all over the place which I can see as being one of the primary reasons for folks to have not taken to the show very well. I do still believe this is one of those shows that are hugely benefitted from being consumed in the native language and it\u2019s a shame I don\u2019t know Korean as I\u2019m sure the dialogues would\u2019ve held more gravitas. \n\nSad that we only have one more episode to see KJH again\u2026I hope he returns to the screen soon with a tighter and better script more begetting to his talent!",

As I've said before it isn't a total lost cause but it's completely utterly forgettable.\n\nAnyway it's a little encouraging that the show continues to do well domestically on streaming platforms and it has a small but dedicated following at least on Youtube. From the little Korean I know it seems the Koreans that do follow it are really enjoying the show and there's absolutely zero hostility or reference to KJH's past scandal (which is more than I can say for the past threads of this drama on this subreddit, LOL sorry not sorry). Looks like this was nothing but a strategic move on the part of KJH's camp to rehabilitate his image. First priority of course of any Korean actor looking to redeem themselves would and should be to redeem themselves in the eyes of their own countrymen. Because apart from plain simple patriotism it's the only country that will give them work right? Looks like us I-fans will have to wait for his next greatest hit. Hopefully it's a cable drama this time and with a team that's not just doing it for a paycheck.",

The scene where he like.. silently caressed the piano before giving in and sitting down to play in Ep 2 really got to me. And the second he started playing, I knew it was Erlkonig. A lot of kdramas (well this one and Big Mouth) seem to like using that piece of music - but only the instrumental. I've always known it as a vocal song (an iconic one).\n\nThis is really lovely so far. I love the relationship between the three guys, and I'm interested to see how the FL slots in. I'm ready for this evil MIL to get her comeuppance because she is horrible.",

And for days.  She wasn't injured. Do hospitals just allow any malingering persons to occupy hospital beds when they are fine?\n* Why is Shin so bothered that a video of him playing the piano was released? Why does he say he's screwed.

The grapes have nothing to do with a workout challenge!\n* We get to find out a little more about what motivated him to study law. &gt;!It sounds like his sister died, and the family is preventing him from seeing them.!&lt;\n* We are introduced to one of the main protagonists.\n\nBTW, the set designers did such a great job.  I love the retro look of his office.  It just looks very untouched mid-century, like the house of an old person that has never updated their house.  It feels just on the cusp of growing from shabby to vintage.",

Let's hope this drama doesn't go off the rails towards the end because so far I'm enjoying it.\n\nEP. 3: Oh, so I guess that's who the Big Bad is. &gt;! the stepmom is a mistress and the ML's sister was betrayed by that lawyer guy &amp; lost custody of her son? Possibly she committed suicide? Based on how miserable that kid looks and how tense that household seems, I already feel bad for him. This story line can potentially get very messy and angsty, so I hope they wrap it up quickly like One Dollar Lawyer. !&lt;\n\nLooking forward to Seo-jin becoming an integral and involved partner of the team. The combined team's banter and antics could be fun to watch. Her fixing that door and how happy they all were was already so funny.\n\nThat kid who's gonna end up defending the POS husband and MIL on the orders of the POS lawyer... He seems quirky, it'd be funny if he also switched over to Sunghan's firm.\n\nEP. 4: I have mixed feelings about the resolution of Park Ae-ran's case. On the one hand, I'm obviously happy that &gt;! Park Ae-ran won her case and got half the building, as she deserved !&lt;. But on the other hand, and you may disagree with this, &gt;! I'm very disappointed that all her character development was thrown out the window imo when she literally knelt down and apologized to the woman who tortured her emotionally for 20 years despite doing nothing wrong (even hitting the MIL from hell was to prevent the crazy old witch from assaulting her daughter). And to have said old witch conveniently do a full 360 and repent of her ways after the husband told the backstory fell just that... Way too convenient and a cop out.!&lt;\n\nThis is a kdrama so ofc &gt;! Giyeong's stepmom is a scheming manipulator and his husband just gives into what she says. Will she be humanized or will she just be villainous? Either way, the poor boy loses. And damn dude, I feel so bad for the ML, he portrays the sense of loss and grief so well. !&lt;\n\nTHE WAY I CHEERED WHEN NERFTUBE DUDE &gt;!RESIGNED AND JOINED THE GOOD GUYS.!&lt; LET THE CLOWNERY AND GOOFY HIJINKS BEGIN.\n\nshipping Seojin and Sunghan real hard. I know it's too early - she's recovering from abuse and the divorce, and he &gt;! from losing his sister !&lt; \\- but I just do. The visuals alone...\n\nI feel so bad for Attorney Shin's poor friend? &gt;! Imagine getting divorced bc your wife got pregnant with her lover's baby... Do all three ahjussis have sad backstories?? !&lt;",

In Asian culture, parents sacrifice themselves for their children and the children grow up as filial and emotionally indebted to them. The spineless, kind husband was in a very tough spot, glad he got his spine back in the end.\n\nThe mil wasn't truly evil, and though belatedly realized her mistakes, glad she had that realization. And the wife sincerely apologizing to her made that happen. It has to be with Asian upbringing that we can't stomach a parental figure, no matter how bad they are, being beaten by their children. It could also be difficult for the wife, so it was understandable that she apologized. \n\nIt was really a nice humanistic touch by the writers to wrap up the situation of this pitiful family through sincerity and understanding as none of them were truly evil. Hope they lived a happy life. \n\nSome people didn't like her apologizing, I respect their choice. To me, unless a person is inherently evil,  having an understanding attitude towards them gives them a chance to better themselves and it also lessens future conflicts. Holding up resentments does no one any good.",

There really would have been little to do about that, unless the husband was willing to stand up to his mother.  Which I still argue he should have.  But it would have created tension.\n\nBut instead, in order to save his mother from a painful truth, he kept quiet for 20 years, while his wife was suffering.  So to avoid \"breaking his mother's heart\", he broke his wife instead.  \n\nHow can you forgive that?  \n\nBut this is a k-drama, so it made for a nice story.

The wife would have known that it was a marriage based on love and not just to smooth over an unplanned pregnancy, so she would have known the truth that the MIL didn't know wtf she was talking about. If anything, the apology in the end shows that the hitting back and seeking a divorce behavior were actually out of character moments and that choosing to lower herself to appease the MIL was more in line with her core personality and beliefs.\n\nThis is somewhat interesting storytelling in that despite the wife being our main perspective character (via being Attny SSH's client), this is not a character growth arc for the wife - but it is one for the husband.\n\nPerhaps this story is not really what they initially sold it as - the one of the modern women fighting against traditional social norms (if anything she plays into them just as much as the MIL.) Because if it is then I agree, ending on the wife making peace just to make peace creates such a hollow, depressing conclusion.\n\nPerhaps if viewed more as a cautionary tale of what happens when a husband gives in to external pressures and fails to protect his wife, it becomes more impactful. Because from my perspective, both the conflict and the resolution fully hinges on the husband prioritizing his wife vs his mother. But still the damage has been done and even if all parties move on to try to be happier in the future, it's bittersweet because nobody can undo the pain.",

But instead it feels like a very cliched case play out with the clear \"victim\" of circumstance because clearly she only cheated due to her abusive husband, and a cliched mustache-twirling evil dude just as much subtlety. \n\nThe show would've made a point if it went on to make that clear. If its trying to portray or add anything of substance then it really isn't doing that as it's a classic \n\nSeeing two shitty people fight over the custody while the one party is very conveniently made out to be evil and the other one placed in a sympathetic light is really cliched. Maybe switching the genders of these characters would get a stronger reaction instead of a cliched female character that is the victim of abusive husband. \n\nPlenty of husbands abuse their wives. It's a real thing. And plenty of wives abuse their husband. It's also a real thing as abusive nature isn't inherent to one gender. \n\nThe first episode started with an evil husband and a sympathetic woman. Then right after that, another case with an evil husband and sympathetic woman. \n\nNot exactly subtle in terms of what is being communicated. Speaking as a dude, that is. \n\n&gt;The case was about CUSTODY, not divorce.\n\nAh, thanks for reminding me. I forgot that the case was about her trying to get the custody even though the narrative made no demonstrations that she had good relationship with her son or that she was capable of taking care of him. \n\n&gt;At least the FL had a reason/excuse for cheating and genuinely agonized for her wrongdoings. What did the husband did?\n\nYea, that is what you call \"justification\". You can say that because......the narrative has given you reasons, as cliched as they maybe. For the husband, the dude is evil and abusive. That's all you need to know. \n\nSee the difference in writing, exploration, and time given to each character's perspective? Along with the fact that there is a certain type of narrative going on here? \n\nDo you see why the husband is acting like that? You can't because the writer specifically chose to provide the narrative from her side and made her the sympathetic figure for the audience. It's a classic and cliched narrative of the poor woman and shitty husband. The husband isn't really given his \"own\" perspective beyond the evil dude. \n\n&gt;He is definitely an ah here for playing with FL's feelings.\n\nHe is. \n\nI'm just more interested in why he was written to be like that. You could've had her cheat with someone decent and her affair being exposed.\n\nBut then we wouldn't have the sextape leaking which leading to her husband using it against her and showing it to her son. Two dudes in her life just happen to be assholes and one assholes actions lead to another asshole being a bigger asshole. \n\nWhich all comes back to making her the victim. \n\n&gt;People are so hung up on cheating that they conveniently ignored that the husband didn't get punished for showing a kid sextape. Why doesn't anybody talk about it the way they are so vocal about cheating?\n\nProbably because no one is going to justify his actions? The husband is a piece of shit. The narrative literally blew its entire load on making that point. You literally couldn't make that point anymore obvious to the point that I think even kindergarten kids would be able to pick up on that. \n\nAnd that women cheating in shows, nowadays, are always portrayed in a way that is the fault of their spouse and basically clears off their own shitty behavior? Would it help to demonstrate the point if the genders were flipped and it was the husband that cheated and instead of two man, it was two females? Both are super cliches and the show isn't offering much of anything beyond a very typical narrative. \n\nWould you like to see documentaries, essay's and books about how he is a terrible person or something? Lol. \n\n&gt;It only gave us her reasons for cheating to better understand the situation, how one thing lead to another. Nowhere did it validate anything.\n\nIf you read some of your post then you should be able to understand how the cheating has been validated. It already provided a clear-narratives and reasons on a silver-platter. There is no subtlety here. It's super clear. \n\nEspecially cheating in real life doesn't always happen like that and can be a really shitty thing to do to someone regardless of their gender.",

Divorce cases have four combinations- both guilty, one of them guilt, none guilty. Since the first case involves FL, it was convenient for the drama to have a case where the husband is shittier than her. I would say the drama was bold to go with the first combination with the FL. **Come with your complaints later if the drama doesn't include other combinations.** \n\n\n&gt;Then right after that, another case with an evil husband and sympathetic woman\n\nThe mil was the evil one here, not the husband. In fact he was so kind that he lost his spine lol. The case here is technically between the mil and the wife, both females, and it is one of the common causes of divorce here in asia because they are overly filial and taught to be tolerant in respect of elders.\n\n&gt;narrative made no demonstrations that she had good relationship with her son or that she was capable of taking care of him\n\nThe son chose to be with his mother. It indirectly gives her a pass that she was a better carer than the dad. \n\n&gt;that is what you call \"justification\". You can say that because......the narrative has given you reasons, as cliched as they maybe. For the husband, the dude is evil and abusive. That's all you need to know\n\nDid you notice I include 'excuse' behind reasons? Anyone in FL's position (when abused) has following options open- divorce, report abuse, run away, kill oneself, murder the abuser, cheat or if they are strong enough, think of a healthier way to cope up and de-stress. The FL did thought about divorce but didn't have the courage to do so after her brother died, so she chose the easiest option, cheating, to de-stress herself. Showing the cause behind the effect is not justification. \n\nWhat reason would you give for an abusive husband? That he could be mentally unwell or had past trauma and suffers from anxiety and paranoia such that he is actually good but can't control his evil instincts? Sorry, that is what one calls justification. \n\n\n&gt;I'm just more interested in why he was written to be like that. You could've had her cheat with someone decent and her affair being exposed\n\nLmao do you really think a decent guy is going to woo a married lady? The FL has to be dumb or too blinded from abuse that she didn't notice the fact\n\n&gt;Especially cheating in real life doesn't always happen like that and can be a really shitty thing to do to someone regardless of their gender\n\nDysfunctional family is one of main causes for cheating. Do your research and come back. Not everyone is a serial cheater. Context matters.",

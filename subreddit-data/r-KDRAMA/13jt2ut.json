The one glaring weakness was the lack of character development of the villain, which rendered him an unthreatening presence throughout the series.",

Having everyone have wind-burned skin and freckles gave them a really consistently interesting look. We're so used to flawless skin in kdramas, it was nice to see everyone still looking amazing with a completely different complexion. So often in post-apocalyptic fiction, everybody's just got burns and sores and looks terrible, so this was nice!",

Great to watch if you need some motivation! \n\n**The Good Bad Mother** (6/14) I absolutely love this show. So far, it is my favorite k-drama of the year. It has sweet romance, nice comedy, interesting characters, good acting and thought-provoking situations. Besides, I love how the show pushes into the morally ambiguous area. It really requires the viewer to take a step back and analyse the situation from different angles. \n\n**Call It Love** (12/16): I never expected a slow-burn love story being so bingeable. I started watching and I didn't see the time pass when I ended up at the 6th episode. Wonderful writing and great characters (I especially love the ML \ud83d\ude01). Highly recommend.",

Can\u2019t wait to finish it!! \n\n**Bo Ra! Deborah (10/14):** this show is the mood booster I needed. I started watching when 8 episodes were out which probably helped with Bo Ra\u2019s breakup blues. I know some people felt like it was too much and I probably would\u2019ve too at some point if I watched it airing lol. My one disappointment with the show is the insensitive comments the writer put in the show \ud83d\ude15\n\n**Age of Youth (11/12):** I had 4 episodes left from March and I\u2019m on the last one now! I like it a little more after my break from it. Overall a nice drama :)\n\n**Empress Ki (17/51):** haven\u2019t watched in the last week or so but still a nice drama \n\nI\u2019m in the midst of finals at the moment.

The quote she said wasn't mocking anyone and was actually from a famous book written about the Holocaust, but I think it was perceived as insensitive by a lot of people anyway because of the view that you don't 'compare' the holocaust to minor problems. But we actually do this with other horrible things all the time, like 'eat your food because starving children in africa don't have any' etc. so I think it's the 'unique' position of the Holocaust in the West that makes this seem incredibly off-color which they likely don't perceive in Asia.",

            "comment": "Completed:\n\n* **She Was Pretty (16/16)** \u2014 Very cute drama. It's filled with tropes, and it's one of the most kdramas to ever kdrama. Love triangle, cold ML, sweet 2ML, cute interactions, cliche moments, and everything in between. I didn't think I would, but I already miss this drama. It made me feel good on the inside. Plus, it wasn't as superficial as I thought it would be. I thought it would be a story of the ML falling for FL once she gets a makeover, but that's not what happened. Also, 2ML? I love him. I love Choi Shi Won now. He'll be in the upcoming Bloodhounds, I believe, so I'm excited for that. Cheers for my first Park Seo Joon drama, though. Yay! I'm quite happy with it as a choice. 7.5/10. Would recommend if you want something cute and trope-y.\n* **Black Knight (6/6)** \u2014 This is one of those dramas I watched because I love one of the leads, and just like everyone else, I was there for Kim Woo Bin. I loved seeing him on screen, but that's about it. Didn't care for the story at all, and I could tell just from the trailer that this wasn't a story for me. 2/10. Did not enjoy.\n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n* **The Good Bad Mother (6/14)** \u2014 I may not have cried like I did last week, but this drama is still superb. It's almost perfect for me. The emotions that it gives me, the angst, the hope. I am so glad Lee Do Hyun took this role. This gives me vibes of his 18 Again role, where LDH has to pretend to be an age that he isn't while also having his character get a second chance at being happy and living his childhood.\n* **Joseon Attorney (14/16)** \u2014 I take it back. I take back the fact that I said that this is one of the lighter sageuks I've seen. It had a toll on me mentally, this week, and I no longer have any idea how the ending will be like. Some characters, I hate more now. Some characters, I love more now. Overall, despite all the emotions and tears, I quite enjoyed this. I like it when I feel attached enough to cry. The acting was spectacular from the 2 actors whose characters mattered the most to the story, and it added to that feeling of attachment. I can't believe it, but I have to say goodbye to Kang Han Su this Sunday, and I'm not ready. It was a good watch. The drama has its flaws (mainly the FL and 2ML), but it's enjoyable and fun. I highly recommend it. We'll see how the ending goes, though, for the final verdict.\n\nI also watched one episode of **My Roommate is a Gumiho**, which is episode 5, and I'm looooving Hyeri. She is so funny. She pulls off the crazy expressions, and she is not afraid to do over-exaggerated faces. She is the highlight of the drama. Also Kang Han-Na. What a beautiful woman.",

There was a moment in EP 1 where Tae Mi sussed out that her new friend had been living abroad because of the types of get-to-know-you questions she was asking (ie: not about her love life/relations). I thought it was a very astute observation, and an interesting view into the every day life of a Korean woman. \n\nI'm also working on **The Roundup** this afternoon. Son Seok Ku does dead eyes really well, and it's scary.",

One of the better KBLs I've seen in awhile.\n\n**Risque Business: Japan (3/6)** \\- Started this because it was suggested by Netflix. I enjoy Shin Dong Yup in his variety shows and he makes an excellent host. One of the more honest discussions around sex and the adult video industry that I've seen on k media.\n\nWill probably start **Doctor Cha** sometime in the next week, it sounds like a good watch,",

It's hard for me to wait week to week for new episodes of airing dramas, but I'm finding that by the time the dramas finish airing I kind of forget which ones I was interested in (despite my lists).\n\nSo, I've jumped into **Tale of the Nine-Tailed 1938**\\--I thought the original was okay, but wasn't overly impressed. Kim Bum did a great job because I couldn't stand him for most of the series (it took his turn with Rain in Ghost Doctor to show me his charms). I'm really liking **1938** so far, yes, it does seem a bit westernized but it's mega-entertaining &amp; as many have mentioned, the bromance is great. Also I love Lee Dong Wook's expressions!\n\n**Dr Romantic 3--**I re-watched season 2 so I would remember everything. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it (only the 2nd kdrama I've ever re-watched). Season 3 is similarly enjoyable, if a bit repetitive. I'm a little annoyed that in order to fit the formula of the last 2 seasons (awful enemy with no scruples attempts to control Our Heroes) Kim Sabu and the director &gt;!create their own trauma by appointing a dr with totally antithetical views to be the head of the new trauma center!&lt;\n\n**My Perfect Stranger--**I want to like this more than I do. I love time travel done well, with all the twisty possibilities involved.  What I find annoying with this drama is my most-hated trope, Let's Not Communicate. Drives me crazy how the leads withhold essential and possibly life-threatening information from each other. Why?.....for.....reasons.\n\n**Black Knight--**Got through 2 episodes, but this is either on hold or dropped, not quite sure. Woo Bin is, as expected, charismatic, but I find the story messy &amp; disjointed. Wish it were better for me, sci fi is something I like. Or used to, anyway....",

But a friend of mine really urged me to watch it and now I\u2018ve binged 6 episodes in two days. I love everything about it. The friendships, the back stories, the great variety between humor, sadness and wholesomeness. I will probably watch both seasons back to back and I can\u2019t wait to see where this will go.",

Finally, FINALLY, I was able to push past the block and keep watching. It's fun. They are cute. Great chemistry.\n\nThe Good Bad Mother (6/14) \u2014 I will watch Lee Do Hyun in anything, any time, any where. His acting in this is fantastic! And not just him. This is a serious drama with funny bits in all the right spots. I am loving this one.\n\nThe Real Has Come (16/50) - typical makjang weekend family drama about a contract marriage. Still ridiculously fun but, my god, do I hope the leads get together soon! The pacing is fantastic despite that.\n\nHappy Merry Ending (6/8) \u2014 BL \u2014 Story pacing is odd. This seems to be a filler show and likely mostly forgettable. I appreciate the mental health aspects of it though. And villain is a good villain.\n\nLove Mate (4/8) \u2014 BL \u2014 Funny! Such strange leads. And the pacing is a bit odd as well. Kind of all over the place. But episode 4? That was something! Even in a non-BL. Can't wait to see what drama hits the fan in the last half.\n\nMy Perfect Stranger (5/16) \u2014 This drama is fascinating! I love the premise so far! Pacing is fantastic and I am genuinely intrigued by the plot. Characters are good. All in all definitely worth it right now.\n\nMy 20th Twenty (8/12) \u2014 the story for this could have been done better. And the FL is supposed to be the same age as me, which is interesting to watch. It\u2019s a nice filler but not sold on it. The acting is terrible. I'll finish it just because but it hasn't improved.\n\nOh! Youngsim (2/10) \u2014 Not sure on this one yet. Getting strong Love is For Suckers vibes, which worries me. Shall see. \n\nNon-Korean:\n\nA Boss and a Babe (11/12) \u2014 Thailand BL \u2014 ForceBook is adorable! Genuinely sad to see this end but can't wait for their new drama - Only Friends. Both of them have improved their acting so can't wait to see it.\n\nOur Dining Table (6/10) \u2014 Japan BL \u2014 I can't get enough of this drama. If it keeps following the manga, and I'm sure it will since it already has so well, this is going to be my favorite Japanese drama of all time. Cute, warm, endearing. And the food leaves me hungry! The acting and micro-expressions are just too good.\n\nNaked Dining (5/12) \u2014 Japan BL \u2014 Angst and food. So much food. So much angst! The two mains are doing a really good job too! I hope something significant happens this week because the subtle stuff is awesome but I definitely want more.\n\nThe Love You Give Me (26/28) \u2014 China \u2014 OMG! The leads and storytelling in this! It\u2019s basically a contract marriage, but also not, and a enemies to lovers, but also not, and they already have a kid together, who is adorable! So much misinformation and miscommunication! Very frustrating on that note, but the story is fantastic.\n\nCompleted:\n\nTrue Beauty \u2014 I\u2019ve been meaning to watch this for a bit and was saving it. I'm in love with literally all of the characters. The FL's family is so fully fleshed out you can literally see them as siblings/parents/etc. The male leads, classmates, etc. are also so well done and fleshed out. I absolutely love this drama.",

            "comment": "I binged **The Slave Hunters**/**Chuno** (2010), a 24-episode epic that I overall enjoyed a lot, primarily because of the acting but also because of how much it reminded me of one of my favorite trends in historical film, the \"Once Upon a Time In...\" series. If this kdrama was called \"Once Upon a Time in Joseon\" I would've known more quickly what it was about, but it only took about 10 minutes into the first episode to get the jist.\n\nStarting with Sergio Leone's *Once Upon a Time in the West* (1968), each decade seemed to have its OUaTi film. Born out of spaghetti westerns and exploitation cinema, films with the audacity to claim the OUaTi as part of their title contained all of the usual exploitation tropes:  teen prostitutes, criminality, slavery, corruption, especially in politics and the military, etc., but they are much more vast in scale. These films are nihilistic yawps of cynicism that turn the hero's journey on its head. Sure, there are heroes in these stories but they're rarely the protagonists. *Once Upon a Time in Mexico,* Robert Rodriguez's 2003 epic, is a good example of the genre (although El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) is more of a hero than most). Or try Tsui Hark's legendary *Once Upon a Time in China* series (1991-)*,* that made Jet Li a star (and a household name, at least in my household).\n\nThese films are epics; they're sagas, dealing with profound themes while wallowing in the muck. No actor is more qualified to ground this type of epic than Jang Hyuk (who I last saw in **My Country: The New Age** being absolutely amazing), playing Dae-Gil, a minor noble turned slave hunter after his affair with a household slave, Eon Nyeon/Kim Hye-won (Lee Da-hae), leads Eon Nyeon's brother to murder the noble family and run away to masquerade as nobles.\n\nDae-gil survives and goes full slave hunter, ostensibly because slaves scarred him for life and tried to kill him, but also because he's searching for his first love, Eon Nyeon, and does so for 10 years. Now Kim Hye-won, she thinks Dae-gil is dead, so when she goes on the run from an arranged marriage and falls in \"love\" with General-turned-escaped-slave Tae-Ha (Oh Ji-Ho), she thinks she's free and clear on the toxic exes front. She is not!\n\nThe first episodes are a glorious grindhouse of a mess. Dae-gil and his slave hunting team - \"General\" Choi (Han Jung-soo) and f-boy Wang-Son (Kim Ji-Suk) - are merciless in hunting down the slaves, and have no problem wallowing in the more sordid side of things. Cheon Ji-Ho (Sung Dong-Il) is wonderfully grotesque as the veteran slave hunter who taught Dae-gil everything he knows.\n\nSo there is too much to sum up more than that, but if you love these types of epically despairing tales, where every character is the scum of the earth but you will weep when they suffer, tSH is great... at least in the beginning.\n\nI loved the entire arc of this, and don't even have time to describe how amazing all the side characters and side plots are. Every character is morally compromised except the toddler tiny Prince, Lee Seok-Kyeon (Kim Jin-Woo), who is the *best baby ever.* I haven't seen a child actor this calm and well-behaved since *The Golden Child*. I do like how the adults around him are so dumb they never just think maybe don't dress him in his little \"I'm the royal prince so kill me\" outfit all the time? Maybe try to blend him in a little? Just saying...\n\nAnyway! You will see all your favorite actors looking 13 years younger, except I swear that Jang Hyuk doesn't age. Also, in the flashbacks, his look is a crime against nature, especially the sideburns. Facial hair was *invented* for this man's face, and he needs to have it always!\n\nI found the later episodes to drag, especially since Tae-Ha is *super boring* unless he's actively swinging his cool sword around. Every minute he's not fighting, I have zero interest in him, and the same goes for the FL, who is one of those \"I'm beautiful and perfect\" characters that is also boring. When they're together, they're a boring couple, and the tiny prince is the only interesting thing in the room.\n\n**tl;dr** **The Slave Hunters/Chuno** is amazing *if* it's the type of show you're into. The political plot drags a lot toward the end, and there is a ton of plot armor (inluding characters who practically rise from the dead, for no good reason), but the cinematography, the editing, the fight choreography, the direction, the OST! It's all fire.",

I feel like I may have never felt so much pity *and* anger at the same character in a drama -- which I credit to both writing and acting. Also, whoever is in charge of the BGM and OST is stealing my heart with the dramatic cued orchestral music that just gets blood pumping in my veins. I also feel like maybe I really need to do some research/digging into how attraction works because I don't think I should be feeling nearly as in love with actress Yoo Sun and Kim Sun Ah as I am.\n\n**King of Dramas** (Rewatch, 11/18) Still loving this rewatch. I like the hijinks and love the acting!\n\n**Gye Baek** (22/36) Song Ji Hyo is gorgeous in this drama and I can't take my eyes off her. I like that the last few episodes gave some really cute and sweet moments but overall, this drama is veering into full on tragic trajectory -- which makes sense given the historical outcomes. It just kind of kills me to see ML try so hard fighting for a country that will soon die out. Not to mention the kings he serves don't seem deserving of his loyalty in my eyes.",

I thought it was going to be a funny, enemies-to-lovers sageuk with cases and stuff, instead the last two weeks pushed it into pure sadness, people dying and all of a 1 ep romance into immediate breakup. Save for the ML's character and performance this is as mediocre as it can get on all facets, from the FL who has no depth and expressions to the most useless SML. Visuals are good, writing is all but, disappointing;\n\n\\- **Bo Ra Deborah (8/16):** consider me surprised. While the plot ain't much, straight as an arrow, characters are tailor made for the actors: In Na on her bubbly masterclass and the ML serviceably vanilla. Secondaries are fine and don't hinder the main storyline, comedy works, chemistry is there, a good mix of laughter, melo bits, cheesy rom-com scenes and mature takes.

But I had different expectations from it as it is always plugged for every recommendation asked from great romance to great chemistry to great action in r/Kdramarecommeds. \n\nWhile the show has good action but I have seen better chemistry and the romance was unconvincing. The ending especially the last episode felt rushed. &gt;!We never got to know what made Kim Mun-Sik turn against his friend. Also what happened to the FL when she gets lost as a child. As well why did Mun Sik lie that she died instead of trying to find her. The reasons for the FL's trauma wasn't given much coverage when it was an important thing. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Another thing is the villains never really suffer. The boss' identity is exposed but someone like him can easily manipulate his way out. !&lt;\n\nOverall this won't be high up in my list of shows nor at the bottom. \n\n**Tale of the Nine Tailed 1938 (On air)** - I started watching it without watching the first part. The happenings in the first two episodes were confusing with too many things happening and too many characters. But in episode 3 and 4 things seem to have settled down. It is episodic with an underlying story going on. \n\n&gt;!The CGI leaves a lot to be desired especially the scene where the ML and FL are fighting on top of the train.!&lt; I liked LDW and Kim Bum in it.

A simple, sweet love story, without being cringey. No unnecessary or over the top drama. The main couple has wonderful chemistry and even the &gt;!forced separation!&lt; made perfect sense and was resolved quickly. \n\nNon Kdrama:\nI've been watching a ton of Taskmaster! It's hilarious and so much fun. A group of comedians are given a task (such as make the best domino rally). All the series are available for free on YouTube.",

Between the set-a-thief revenge plot, &gt;!secret cancer!&lt;, &gt;!birth secrets!&lt;, &gt;!noble idiocy break-ups!&lt; and years of lying, misunderstanding and miscommunication it's not what I'm looking for.\n\n**Joseon Attorney** (14/16): Sticking with this one to the end, though mostly just to get some narrative closure. It had such a unique premise and the historical legal shenanigans were a fun twist on the basic Kdrama revenge legal thriller, but as a character journey and/or romance it was very formulaic. The search for a new fave legal drama continues.\n\n**My Perfect Stranger** (6/16): This one took an interesting turn with the possibility of &gt;!political pro-democratic activism!&lt; being involved in the 1987 murders. The time travel is a bit iffy and it's questionable that they're going to be able to develop a meaningful romance with everything else going on; but so far it's an intriguing village whodunit where everyone is a suspect with some side slice of life reminiscent of classic BBC murder mystery cozies. \n\n**Recipe for a Farewell** (12/12): Such a lovely, well-polished gem of an understated melodrama. Short, sweet but not saccharine and all about the inevitably of different types of goodbyes interspersed with culinary asides. Wish there were more of these quiet, realistic melodramas; Our Blues hit the same notes, but My Liberation Notes was too self-aware of being a prestige drama and didn't have the same warm-but-melancholy feeling for me.",

My issue is more that the narrative is heavy-handed with them, and at this point it feels like they're being used as a shortcuts to make certain characters more sympathetic while simultaneously ignoring the long-term implications and side-effects.\n\nBut I'm going to keep an eye on this one too, just in case it does pull off a second half turn-around that doesn't feel cheap or schmaltzy.",

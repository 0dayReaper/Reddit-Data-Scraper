It makes the story work better, the more cliche the more it tracks with those dating games. I\u2019m already hooked it looks cute and fluffy, just wish the episodes were longer \ud83d\ude2d",

Now that they have reconnected, it's going to be interesting to see where the festering feelings lead them to. \n\nKi Tae is the one driving this now and he knows more about Wan than Wan knows about him.

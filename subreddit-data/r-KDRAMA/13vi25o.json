    "postText": "[Hello](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) and welcome to Kim Tan's Talk Time (Tuesday)! \n\nThis is a free-for-all discussion in which *almost* anything goes, don't diss *The Heirs* or break any of our other core rules. General discussion about anything and everything is allowed. \n\nConsider this post a refuge from all the memes and fanart that are  pouring in and enjoy the peace and quiet. Think of it as Tan's family  wine cellar, [the perfect place to chill out from the world](https://i.imgur.com/ZbVbp0Z.png) in a fabulous sweater and have a little chat.\n\n**Who is this Kim Tan I keep hearing about and why does he have not one, but two threads dedicated to him?** Good questions. If you take a look through our [glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions), you will find all the answers you seek;\n\n&gt;**KIM TAN** is the lead male in [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA)\u2019s favourite drama, [The Heirs](https://mydramalist.com/6640-the-heirs). He\u2019s kind of the worst but he has great sweaters so it balances out. \u201cKim Tan\u201d is used in three ways on [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA); 1) when referring to [Lee Min Ho\u2019s](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) seminal character in *The Heirs*, 2) when referring to Automod (alt. [Tan Bot](https://i.redd.it/qr33zzkhwgg31.gif))   - \u201cKim Tan is feeling very triggered by my post\u201d, \u201cS\\*\\*\\*!

            "comment": "When I pick a kdrama to watch at random I try not to read anything about it ahead of time so I am always surprised when a show I like has nothing but negative comments on Asian Wiki. Case in point: I binged **Item** (or **The Item**, depending, although that's dumb because there's more than one item) on KOCOWA (32 episodes; 2019), and while the series clearly sets up the potential for a second season, no one in the comments seems to want one!\n\nSo I was hooked right from the premise: seemingly mundane objects have niche magic powers and if you collect them all you get one of those vaguely defined \"your wish\". I'm a sucker for magic artifact dramas because they can use *deus ex machinae* with impunity within the confines of their worldbuilding.\n\nIn **Item**, the items in question are small objects imbued with emotional meaning by the victims of a horrible fire in an amusement park tower. Over 300 people, including many children, died in the fire, and the items they left behind can perform seeming miracles.\n\nThis show has elements of so many others just listing its influences should count as a spoiler, but one thing I really liked is that the overall plot and the villain's schemes unfold at a pretty quick and exciting pace, and the characters are fleshed out enough to have their good ensemble moments.\n\nThe ML is Kang Gon (Ju Ji-Hoon), and I'm sorry, but JJH is so perfect at playing one of my favorite contemporary ML types: the Hot Ethical Prosecutor^(TM). JJH is so good at this it's like they grew him in a lab for MLs. He lures you in with his ethics and his standards and his suits and then he hits you with the casual outfits and being a caregiver to his young niece, Kang Da-In (Shin Rin-Ah, another amazing child actor) following the death of his brother (a death that as left Da-In mute due to trauma, so she speaks in melodeon code; I've seen weirder).\n\nProsecutor Kang finds out about the artifacts the hard way: first a dream in which he has to stop a train using a bracelet that gives him mystic energy force powers of some kind while the FL walks off a roof nearby, seemingly to her death, and then in the waking world when Ko Dae-Soo (Lee Jung-Hyun, who has perfected a sense of sketchy vulnerability) beats him up with that same magic bracelet. The bracelet ends up in young Da-In's hands, and everyone is after it!\n\nJin Se-Yun is Lieutenant Shin So-Young, a profiler and the kind of cop that's an insufferable know-it-all who just happens to be right a lot. Only hot 2ML Seo Yo-Han (Oh Seung-Hoon) believes her theories, but he's got his own problems. I last saw JSY in **Born Again**, where she managed to be in a love triangle with two of the most gorgeous actors working today and have exactly zero chemistry with both of them. Luckily, **Item** has no romantic plot aside from a joke or two, so JSY's inability to spark with anyone else onscreen doesn't impact the story much. Maybe it's the material and not the actress, but I remain neutral on the subject since I haven't seen her other shows.\n\nThe villain is fire! Yes, the eccentric Chaebol psychopath is a common trope, but Kim Kang-Woo does it better than so many other actors, that it carries through. While they label him a sociopath onscreen, he displays so much actual malice in being essentially an unhinged thrill killer that psychopath seems a more apt descriptor. I've added **Woman of 9.9 Billion** to my watch list just to see more of him.\n\n**Good Stuff**:  The first half of the season has good pacing, an interesting plot, and a villain with a clear motivation: gotta catch all the items to get a wish! Plus someone is using an item to murder people who got away without punishment after the tragic fire that created the items! There's an abusive clown ghost with a hat that sucks the life out of people! There's a wonderfully effusive conman (Bang Hak-Jae, played by Kim Min-Kyo, who reminded me strongly of Michael Pena's character from the Ant-Man movies) with an item of his own. There is mind-control and body-switching and many comas (or \"vegetative states\") and alternate universes and prophetic dreams.\n\n**Bad Stuff:**  Yeah, that ending. I had a feeling similar to **King: Eternal Monarch** in that I could see what they were *trying* to do but they just couldn't pull it off. The final episodes of both shows were their worst episodes, all because they couldn't get across the rather simple ending themes. There's actual potential for another season with **Item** but the emotional throughlines are just bungled.\n\nI seem to have enjoyed this way more than most viewers, but that's all on the stellar leads and side characters. It's a little like a combination of **Signal** and **The Sound of Magic**, but with melodeon instead of singing.",

That\u2019s why NBCUniversal had to pay itself $500 million to stream Universal TV\u2019s \u201cThe Office\u201d on Peacock and Warner Bros. Discovery paid $425 million for the streaming rights to the WBTV-produced \u201cFriends.\u201d\n\nWhat they advise is to own the movie or series people would like to have it and watch it over and over again other than rely on streaming services.\n\nedit: quotes\n\nEdit1:\n\n[Netflix Threatens To Purge Shows In **UK** To Avoid Falling Foul Of \u201cOnerous\u201d New Streamer Regulations](https://deadline.com/2023/05/netflix-threatens-delete-uk-shows-media-bill-1235382495/)\n\n&gt; The Media Bill states that major streamers must consider impartiality in the context of contemporary events, pointing specifically to \u201ccurrent public policy\u201d and matters of \u201cpolitical or industrial controversy.\u201d\n\nWell that bill doesn\u2019t affect Netflix only so Disney+ also sent them their arguments:\n\n&gt; Disney said: \u201cGiven the differences between linear broadcasting and VoD , the robust audience protection measures put in place by most VoD services, the varying consumer propositions and brand promises made by different VoD services, it seems inappropriate to apply uniform rules on all VoD services, whether that is strict content rules or mandated ratings.\u201d",

While the combination of zombie outbreak and palace politics in joseon era is unique, the storyline was generic. I agree that the production was of high quality and that along with acting were the best part of this drama for me. The mickey mouse hair/head piece was unexpectedly funny though, suited that jeonjeon mama. \r\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed it so **(8/10)**\r\n\r\nS1 ended on a cliffhanger so I immediately started s2 lol\r\n\r\nBtw has anyone watched Taiwanese drama **more than blue: a series**?",

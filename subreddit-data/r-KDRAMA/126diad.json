It feels too overdone and legit shows one big flaw in each of them -- did the ML really *not* even try and seek/look for better women but instead just painted them all with one brush? Did FL truly have no motivation to seek out better men or at least to surround herself with better men/healthy relationships so as to try and see that good ones do exist?!&lt;\n\nI also felt that the FL was kinda portrayed as &gt;!a guy's girl, perhaps almost as a manic pixie dream girl - she drinks like a fish, beats up everyone, rides the motorcycle, can be cute ON DEMAND. Aren't we tired of this?!&lt;",

Anyway, it was not just one man, it was also &gt;!her father.!&lt; Research shows that women with a bad relationship &gt;!to their fathers, are more promiscuous as young.!&lt; \n\nI with that they had added at least something girly that she enjoyed. Also her friend was boring. The &gt;!female friend!&lt; of ML was nice enough, why didn't that help?\n\nI am very pleased that many people here in this sub notice these things.

            "comment": "Middle of the night here, but I want to say something about **Alchemy of Souls**: The quality difference between different parts of the script, part two. Example (big  spoiler): Prince says to Jang Uk: &gt;!You had no power then, but you were so alive. Now you have all the power, but you are dead.!&lt;\n\nOr Park Jin who tries to cook something with the wrong ingredient, saying that &gt;!if this is possible, then anything is possible!&lt;. \n\nBut in between this we have stupidities like a talk in episode five where you would think the character has no idea about who she is talking to, the one-note of most of the characters, the development of some of the relationships where you think that the change didn't happen anyway, not to speak of the uselessness of most of the women that has becoming not a thing of men getting 80% percentage useful lines and activities, but is now close to zero for the women, so that the majority of the public have noticed. \n\nMy own brain works so that sometimes I am quite smart and can write quite well, and then I write quickly whatever I have to say. Other days (most days) my brain is steeped in fog and however long time I spend on trying to come up with a joke, it doesn't arrive to me. \n\nI keep wondering what happened. Did the writers get corona? \nDid they first write some points in the manuscript: This will happen in eps five, now lets fill in the bits in between, but then when they were going to do the \"in between\" they didn't have time or possibility?",

One of the things I hoped to do when I travel to Seoul next year is visit the cafe that was a setting for several important scenes. I think it's called Bukhansan Atelier.\n\n Unfortunately, it seems the cafe may be closed or at least has no more social media presence. \n\nCan anyone confirm or otherwise? Thank you!",

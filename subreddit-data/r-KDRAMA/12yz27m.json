This is the themed post for all identification questions and requests, including dramas! \n\nBefore posting in this thread please take a look through our [discussion resources - who/what/which is this section](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/discussionresources#wiki_who.2Fwhat.2Fwhich_is_this.3F) which outlines ways in which you can work out many of these requests for yourself.\n\nYou can ask here for help identifying the following things: Dramas, Actors, Product  Placement (either product or brand), Drama Locations, Clothing,  Accessories, Music (OST or background).\n\nPlease  provide a picture if possible (upload on imgur) and include as much  contextual information as you know (e.g. source drama, broadcast year, episode number and time stamp, etc.).\n\nOnce you have found an answer please edit your original comment to state \"**SOLVED**\" in bold caps at the top so people don't spend time trying to help unnecessarily.\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

Thank you to anyone who helps &lt;3 I\u2019m sorry for the lack of information, I\u2019m racking my brain for all I can remember.",

I will link a YouTube video and the time for it. I think it might have been a song created solely for the drama\u2026 But if not and the song actually exists, I would appreciate if someone can give me the name of it.  \nIf its not an actual song and something just created for the drama, if anyone knows how I can cut the song and remove all background noise, please help me. I would appreciate it if someone can put it on Soundtrack or send it to me. Anyways yeah, here\u2019s the link:  \nhttps://youtu.be/bHJFfrgRNH4  \nThe time it starts and ends is 2:14-3:44  \n\\-  \nThank you very much.",

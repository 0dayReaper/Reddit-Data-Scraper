He comes from a small rural town and is used to living in the quiet countryside. He struggles to form meaningful relationships, and moving to the busy South Korean capital has left him feeling disorientated and confused. The older Jae Won, meanwhile, is now returning to Seoul \u2013 and the same university \u2013 after completing his mandatory military service. The duo starts to develop a mutual curiosity about one another. But things begin to escalate when Ji Hyun joins the same surfing club that Jae Won attends. Their bond begins to deepen as Ji Hyun discovers a love of surfing and the sea. When the surfing club embarks on a journey, the duo finds themselves together alone \u2013 and share a kiss. Later, though, Jae Won begins to act as if nothing happened between them. Is this just a fleeting attraction...or the love of a lifetime?

I don't know what to simp over more the acting, the plot, or the cinematography all of it, just killing it. Shout out to the rest stop guy, doing the most.",

Let girls enjoy their instagram smh.\n* Aeri talking about buying vintage clothes vs shopping online so you don't wear the same thing as someone else, but then Jihyun literally getting the most basic thing: &gt;!a hoodie and jean jacket!&lt; lol.\n* . &gt;!Jihyun grabbing Jaewon's leg!&lt; at the bar after he got upset. Asddfhghjk. And poor Jaewon. Taehyung is a terrible friend :,( really.\n* It was sweet how Jihyun gave Jaewon &gt;!the hangover drink like Jaewon did for him before. But really sad seeing Jaewon get so knockout drunk.!&lt; In the library in ep 4, Jaewon tried to say he doesn't get drunk that often since freshman year, and yet...\n* I didn't like the flashback to the camera store. Felt unnecessary and saccharine. I'm glad it wasn't too drawn out.\n\nEpisode 6\n\n* The color grading in this was really inconsistent! Like when they first get to the beach and it's all orange, weird stuff going on.\n* The trot mixtape lol. So random. But I love the convenience store guy. And it was cute the difference between how Jihyun and Jaewon reacting to him asking if they were with their girlfriend.\n* The night scene by the ocean where Jaewon tells Jihyun about &gt;!his brother!&lt;. I thought this was well done. Jaewon's straight, blunt delivery. I liked how they focused on Jihyun being unsure of what to say in response and him admitting to that.\n* The &gt;!kiss!&lt; in the ocean was so cute so romantic so well done asdfgfh.\n* But bruh the next 10 mins noooo. Was all so fast. Too much montage. Felt a little rushed/disorienting to me. But maybe it needed that for that cliffhanger of an ending...? All the (heavy-handed) foreshadowing of the scary, dark waves throughout this episode though, you could tell it was coming. I will wait for next week's eps with bated breath.\n* P.S. I missed seeing Jihyun's boss and roommate this week. I did not miss Eunji one bit haha.",

Esp In the last 2 eps they were literally showing that Doldam is Woojin's found family, He is happy and his monologues are way too sentimental and he has the gun always pointed at him (We all know he is the hero and got the plot armour but still) . This season is way too intense already and they needn't do this to raise the stake. But I'm liking how the side characters are explored in this season Dr.Insu, Euntak and I want to know more about Dr.Bae, like how did he wind up here ? What's his story? What made him stay at Doldam?",

While the onus is on CEJ, the least he could do is offer some comfort after knowing how affected she was in the OR. \n\nI found it selfish of him, &gt;!not only dismissing it as just a \u201cspecial case,\u201d but also ensuring that CEJ didn\u2019t resent him for it.!&lt;\n\nYHJ typing up his on-duty absence: &gt;!Chicken Burger!&lt;\n\nAlso &gt;!no one thought to page him during an emergency, and he had the audacity to join his colleagues for fried chicken!&lt; while unaware of the chaos that happened hours earlier. \n\nI\u2019m so proud of Dr Dong for &gt;!staying with the patient!&lt;, now this is character progress! Happy to see &gt;!him and SWJ got closer!&lt; after that tense situation, but the latter had to spoil the moment by requesting an expensive drink.

Personally didn\u2019t watch S1 and was hoping this season wouldn\u2019t fall to the same issues but seems like it is :(",

Cha Eun-jae is written like a side character.\n\nIt's all about Seo Woo-jin. He always gets the best scenes and surgeries while Cha Eun-jae is mainly disregarded. The writers, plot, and even Kim Sabu are heavily biased towards Seo Woo-jin.\n\nIt's giving, **\"He's everything. She's just Ken.\"**",

I'm already preparing myself in the event that Doctor Kim actually decides to retire. With his MS obviously progressing, I wouldn't rule that out.

If Woo Jin gets shine more after this episode it's understable, since he is the lead. In fact i feel hyoseop is underutilized in season 3 so far. He shine more in season 2",

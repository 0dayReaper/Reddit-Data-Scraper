            "comment": "OK. Here goes:\n\nI started watching KDramas like to many of you, in 2019 when Netflix made a suggestion which I first scoffed at, and then out of boredom finally gave it a try - CLOY. My viewing has been 99.9% KDramas since then.\n\nMy rating standard is quality of production/story, followed by the connection I feel to the storyline or characters. I am NOT grading on what will win awards. I am down with trope, I am romcom centric. I have to be honest though sometimes time can make something loose it's luster because I have not recently viewed it and/or I really enjoyed something I recently finished, or because I am not Korean, as I have picked up on some Korean culture,  some scenes of the KDramas I have gone back and enjoyed more because I understand some of the subtleties better.  Confusing? I agree - so lets get to my top 10!\n\n1.00   2019 - Crash Landing on You. My gateway. The storyline dynamic of North/South Korea was fascinating to me as a US citizen as well as seeing the Korean culture for the first time. From funny to poignant in a heartbeat.\n\nSPOILER ALERT: Scenes I remember/enjoy: &gt;!All the saying goodbyes between Seri and the NK troops. The Christmas with the NK troops and Seri's awards. The NK soldiers in SK was epic. The scene were the NK woman see their faces on the makeup products that Seri made when she got back to SK ripped my guts out. Mr. Ri flying by on a motorcycle to save Seri. When Siri comes out of hiding with Mr Ri's mom and moms says you don't have to die! SML dying in Dan's arms. The storyline and moments around the song and Switzerland.!&lt; Damn, I need to watch this one again!\n\n2.00   2018 - Mr. Sunshine. The storyline, cinematography, music, acting, costumes, all of it top notch. The period fascinated me. I knew NOTHING about this show before I watched it. I didn't know this subreddit existed and then BAM, well you know. This is the only one of my top 5 I have not rewatched or won't rewatch. Maybe someday.\n\nSPOILER ALERT: Scenes I remember/enjoy: &gt;!The letter passing back and forth with the expectation of love in the future and then NO! He freakin dies in the train scene in front of her and then the everyone starts dying! I was not right for a couple of weeks after I finished this and I think I need to hug myself know!!!! !&lt; Anyway, outstanding show for sure.\n\n3.00   2020 - It's Okay Not to be Okay. One of my favorite storylines. It is one of the few Dramas I tell people they need to finish to see the entire story arc. FL's outfits, Crazy funny scenes and scenes that make you stop and think.\n\nSPOILER ALERT: Scenes I remember/enjoy: &gt;!The entire story arc from the opening scene of Ko Moon Young eating lunch to the ending where you realize the entire drama is a reversal of her trauma and life story that came out in the opening scene. Amazing. The arguments between the KMY and Moon Sang Tae, My first time seeing Kim Mi Kyung who was instantly my favorite KDrama Mom. The scene where she is consoling Name Joo Ri and says well actually she is really pretty, and NJR losing it. The back and forth between the FL and the ML and I came to realize all of the dialog played out exactly opposite of what they said by the end of the drama. Fun.!&lt;\n\nOk. Y'all (sorry, Texan) are probably tired of the spoilers: Here are the remaining 7ish:\n\n4.00   2017 - Strong Woman Do Bong Soon\n\n5.00   2020 - Itaewon Class\n\n5.50   2014 - Healer\n\n6.00   2022 - A Business Proposal\n\n7.00   2023 - Love to Hate You\n\n8.00   2022 - Extraordinary Attorney Woo\n\n9.00   2019 - Rookie Historian Go Hae Ryung\n\n9.25  2021 - Hometown Cha Cha Cha\n\n9.50  2019 - Hotel de Luna\n\n9.75  2017 - I am not a Robot\n\n9.80  2013 - My Love From Another Star\n\n9.81  2022 - Alchemy of Souls\n\n9.82   2019 - Touch Your Heart\n\n9.83   2018 - Encounter\n\n9.84   2016 - Goblin\n\n9.85   2018 - What's Wrong With Secretary Kim\n\n9.90   2016 - Cinderella and the Four Knights\n\n10.00   2013 - Heirs - (Just Because).\n\nPhew. Bottom line - I am loving watching KDramas and interacting with this community.",

I still believe that Manbok was the most underrated character.\r\n\n**It's Okay To Not Be Okay** \\- Funky, fresh, unique. I was so thoroughly enthralled with the editing, I'd never seen any western show like it. Great soundtrack too!\r\n\n**Vincenzo** \\- If CLOY got me into this whole kdrama thing, 'cenzo was the final nail in the coffin. Never been so entertained by a piece of media in my life, and even more so by the fanbase. Best on-air watching experience ever.\r\n\n**The Devil Judge** \\- Unforgettably batshit experience. I remember every minute of it and it still feels like a fever dream. Bonus points for absolutely Victorian gothic levels of homoeroticism.\r\n\n**Happiness** \\- I hate zombie shows. This is the best show ever. No notes.\r\n\n**The Red Sleeve** \\- AMAZING. Masterpiece. Another show that I think about all the time. My man Lee Junho.\r\n\n**Be Melodramatic** \\- Defines the slice-of-life genre. This should be required watching for anyone who experiences adulthood.\r\n\n**Glitch** \\- Alright, I know people have mixed opinions on this one, BUT I really enjoyed it! I think the marketing was just misleading. Love me some alien-hunting girlfriends. And Nana is totally hot. I think we need more sapphic (-coded) kdramas in general.\r\n\n**Yumi's Cells** \\- Honest and fun portrayal of adulthood. I love how this drama leans into the inherent awkwardness and futility of everyday life while still remaining hopeful and upbeat. And as a huge animation nerd, the cells are such a delight to watch. Another really great soundtrack.\r  \n\r  \n**The Glory** \\- Never binged a show so fast in my LIFE. Time did not exist until I finished the last episode. And I usually hate this sort of genre. Amazing.",

Will rewatch and hope for a(n unlikely) second season). \n\n\n\nThe Fiery Priest - just so good. I will never understand why so few people discussed this while it was airing. Hopefully when season 2 is officially announced, more will watch S1 and get into it.\n\n\n\nMr Queen - I was so late to watch this one but it exceeded every expectation. As little as I cared for the palace politics, I love this and will never stop recommending it. Another one I will rewatch at some point.\n\n\n\nDali and Cocky Prince - while the storyline wasn't my number one favorite, the relationship between the leads has me coming back to rewatch cute moments between them. Despite some depressing story arcs, it is a fun watch that has a different vibe from a lot of drama.\n\n\n\nClean With Passion For Now - the forced separation irritated the hell out of me, but overall I loved this show. So bizzare and funny, surprisingly moving in parts too. I will be watching the cdrama version on the recommendation of a fellow redditor.\n\n\n\nWould You Like A Cup of Coffee? - another one I have not finished yet but am loving. It has such a peaceful vibe without being boring. I'm enjoying dramas with shorter episodes recently, this one's is nice to destress watch.\n\n\nOther favorites: Vincenzo, Hospital Playlist, Flower of Evil, Run On, CLOY, My Roommate is a Gumiho.",

I really like that it's kind of a less trope-y take on the crime drama with a focus on the victims. There's so many good things about it that I could say.\n2. My Mister - I'm only halfway through but I'm loving this so much. Again, the writing is  so good, the characters feel so believable and real, and I really like that the focus is on other types of relationships beyond romance. Also I think I could watch Lee Sunkyun just sit on a park bench for an hour and be like, \"that's great TV.\"",

            "comment": "Not in any particular order.\n\nCLOY - My very first K drama way back when and to this day still leaves me with fond memories.  Prior to that my indulgencies lay with historical Chinese dramas.  What I loved about CLOY was just how effortless but impactful Se-Ri and Captain Ri's love story was.  The tear jerking scenes just about did me in and I cannot say enough about the co-stars/merry band of supporting actors who all held their own throughout.  CLOY started my love affair with multi-character dramas which continues to be my favorite genre.\n\nGoblin - Stellar directing and hands down one of the more well rounded dramas ever written from start to finish and to top it off an amazing OST.\n\nBe Melodramatic - Not only is it funny and sobering at times (as the title suggests) but I learned a thing or too about how K dramas are written/produced etc. If you have ever wondered why a drama which began as strongly entertaining but suddenly derailed and imploded itself, chances are the writer passed it on to an Assistant writer at some point.  At least that is what I would like to believe.  Be Melodramatic also put actress Baek Ji-Won on my radar as a true definition of a classical actor.  \n\nThe Red Sleeve - Although heavily fictionalized, the drama did not disappoint in re-enacting a beautiful and tragic love story between the King and a maid turned concubine.  I always felt that as an idol turned actor, Lee Jun-Ho was pretty good but in his role as Yi San he impressed me even more.  The chemistry between himself and Lee Se-Young was outstanding and I cannot even imagine their roles being played by anyone else. \n\nWhen The Weather is Fine - I cannot say enough about this drama. The storyline, the chemistry of the leads, the supporting cast, the picturesque location shots, and the poetic narratives, all combined into a harsh reality of how life can be.  Had I missed out on this gem, I truly would have been sad. Lee Jae Wook took his role as a stuttering academic genius to another level and kept me in stitches with every scene, Another amazing actor in my opinion that transforms himself effortlessly in all his projects.\n\nDo You Like Brahms - At times a bit clich\u00e9 but given that the story is about two tortured souls who are almost a mirror image of each other, that is to be expected I guess.  I fell in love with Park Eun-Bin again after watching her in this and am constantly amazed at the range of her acting abilities. \n\nHeard it through the Grapevine.  A very dark comedy but oh boy does it pack at lot in. I feel that this is one of those rare unknown masterpieces and introduced me to actors/actresses that I had not seen before. Cautionary tales abound in this drama without the sloppiness or lack of seriousness to the stories which the writer wanted to convey.\n\nHospital Playlist S1 and some parts of S2 - The funny thing is I was one of those viewers who championed a second season and a third, but somehow the writer just bludgeoned one of the storylines in season 2 which left me a bit annoyed but all in all, it is still a solid watch.  Loved the camaraderie and moments of musical interludes between the friends.\n\nBecause this is my First Life/A Piece of Your Mind - Both made my top ten just by the sheer amount of times I have re-watched them.  Jung So-Min is not really one of my favorite actresses' but I feel in the role she played as Ji-Ho a not so confident aspiring writer, she knocked it out of the park and gave an amazing performance and I respected her for it.\n\nDivorce Attorney Shin - It is still early in the year, and although ongoing, this has the potential to be my favorite 2023 drama.  All the vital components are there.  Relatively stellar and believable acting, realistic writing, and just the right amount of melodrama to keep me entertained.  I find myself anxiously waiting for the episodes week after week.\n\nThere you have it.  Assignment completed but there are so many more I wanted to add so I kind of feel like I cheated on them.  \ud83d\ude0a",

She crosses paths with Park Dong Hoon in her workplace, a man with a seemingly perfect career and life. She approaches him with cunning intentions and how their relationship turns out forms the crux of the story\n* A hug. Dramas rarely get the healing genre right and they did it perfectly.  (ps: can be a little slow initially, but if you love dramas that do interpersonal relationships right, then it's for you\n\n**2. Light in your eyes- 9/10**\n\n* Synposis: A young woman possess a watch that can turn back time, but ages you everytime it's used. She turns 80 year old after she frantically uses it multiple times to save her dad from an accident.\n* it's so unique. &gt;!There's a huge plot twist at the end and though I watched the drama knowing it very well, it hit me like a truck.!&lt; \n\n**3. Beyond Evil - 8.5/10**\n\n* Synposis: A cop new to a village, and his quest to find a killer. Multilayered characters and profound screenplay.\n* Thrillers are my fav genre and mostly the dramas I chose to watch. This one is excellent, a perfect mix of crime and psychological thriller \n\n**4. Signal - 10/10**\n\n* Synopsis: A profiler in 2015 finds a walkie-talkie through which he is able to communicate to a cop from the '80s- 90s. together, they solve cases which would otherwise go cold.\n* it's THE thriller, they handled it so perfectly, no bad loops, even the paradoxes were handled so well. The cast is perfect and especially Cho Jin-woong, he's a gem. The events are also inspired from some real crimes- Hwaseong serial murders, Miryang gang rape. One of those dramas where I wish I forget everything about it and watch again with the same inital feelings&gt;!Epsiode 13 made me cry a river and the optimistic open ending is the perfect way to end the drama !&lt;\n\n**5.Mouse - 10/10**\n\n* Synopsis: The story of Jung Ba-reum and detective Ko Moo-chi as they unearth the truth of a psychopath killer.\n* The story is based on this though- Psychopaths lack empathy, guilt or remorse, what if they get to experience it. If you like thrillers, this drama will make you love thrillers. If you love them already, then this is gonna be a treat. A lot of inspirations from real crimes and top-notch screenplay, intricate plot. &gt;!The plot twist is gonna shock you to the core and rethink everything about the drama, I still feel bad about not trusting Sung Yo-Han!&lt;\n\n**6. The Glory- 9.5/10**\n\n* Moon Dong-eun is brutally bullied (bully is an understatement) and decides to quit school since even adults turn her back on her. She's carefully calculated and crafted a plan over the years so she can give them back the same pain and hell they once inflicted on her\n* Recent dramas have a bad reputation of messing the final pretty bad, but Glory devoured! Huge props to the writers for completing the drama with the same pace they started. I havent see much of Song Hye-Kyo's dramas and didnt have much of an opinion on her acting earlier, but this one changed my mind. \n\n**7. Reborn rich- 9/10**\n\n* Synopsis: A loyal man who's \"serving\" the chaebol family of Soonyang corporation is betrayed and murdered by them. He wakes up as the  youngest grandson of the chairman. He plans to take over soonyang with his knowledge of the future and exact his revenge\n* I'm going to pretend the finale isnt how it ended but the webtoon ending happened. Except the last episode, it's brilliant. Lee Sung-min better bag all awards with his performance in this drama \n\n**8. Prison playbook- 9/10**\n\n* Synopsis: Kim Je-hyuk, a start baseball player's life is turned upside down after he rightfully assaults the man who attempted to sexually assault his sister. Prison life is hard for him, but he makes best friendships inside\n* Okay, this one will make you laugh like crazy and then make you shed tears every episode. It's very wholesome and will make you appreciate how everyone has so much love to offer. \n\n**9. Hospital playlist- 8.5/10**\n\n* Five doctors who've been friends since med school and how they live their personal and professional lives, with a hectic schedule. They also have a band together and perform often. It's the second installment of wise life series, the first one is prison playbook\n* The long episodes are the only cons i can think of. The friendships, romance is so refreshing. It almost feels like you are witnessing them go on with their daily lives \n\n**10. Misaeng- 8/10**\n\n* Synopsis: Jang Geu-rae decides to join as an intern at a big company after he fails to become a pro baduk player. In the cut throat chase of becoming permanent employees, he's an outcast having joined due to a \"recommendation\", having only a GED, minimal communication skills.\n* Geu-rae sometimes resonated with me, when we feel like we're the only average ones while everyone is around is exceptional. Not really a binge material but a watch one ep a day and enjoy it's brilliant story development \n\nOther mentions:\n\nThrillers: Flower of evil, Little women, Extracurricular\n\nSlice of life: My liberation notes\n\nRomcom: Crash course in romance, Weight lifting failry Kim Bok joo\n\nSageuk: King's affection, Mr Queen\n\nfantasy: Goblin, uncanny counter",

            "comment": "Healer is THE quintessential Korean drama. A perfect blend of action and romance, and likeable leads.\n\nGoblin is beloved by many, but i know many who could not stomach the age gap between ML and FL\n\nCrash landing on You is beloved by many as well, chiefly for the chemistry between the leads, the wonderful supporting cast and the novel story. For me, i find the entire premise of the story too dumb and couldn't suspend my disbelief\n\nWhat's wrong with secretary kim- what makes this such a GOOD rom-com? well partly because Park Min Young fell in love with the male lead, which is why the drama felt so real. /s\n\nHeirs is /r/KDRAMA 's all time favourite. Need I say more? /s\n\nif you ask me, my personal favourites are: 1) OUr beloved summer (best romance) 2) Sh**ting stars (best rom-com) 3) Dr Romantic (not season 2, season 2's a hot mess) (best drama) 4) Hospital Playlist (best slice of life) 5) any drama with Seo yea ji in it, she's GORGEOUS. And did i say that she is GORGEOUS?",

Reply 1988\n5. Just Between Lovers\n6. My Mister\n7. While You Were Sleeping\n8. Designated Survivor: 60 Days\n9. Hot Stove League\n10. Gaus Electronics\n\nLonger:\n\n1. Prison Playbook. Still my number one kdrama. It made me cry, it made me laugh. Adore the characters and their stories. Also Kim JeHyuk is simply an amazing character!\n\n2. My Liberation Notes. Fresh entry in my top list since Ive just completed watching it (this week). And I swear, if the ending was slightly different, I would put it higher without any hesitation. Episode 13 mesmerized me. \n\n3. 18 Again. Just Adore it. Cried like a litre of tears, especially during those episode \"epilogues\".   And I just love Lee DoHyun. :)\n\n4. Reply 1988. Would've been higher if not the ending. But it's a solid title anyway, such an emotional and likeable. \n\nIt's my second time bringing up the ending. In case someone reading this without watching  Reply or MLN - they both had a great endings, it's just that I wish they were slightly different (for my own preferences). They are not \"ending kills the title entirely \" kind of kdramas in my opinion.\n\n5. Just Between Lovers. Love the emotions, love Lee JunHo, love the music. Everyone should try it and try loving it \ud83d\ude0c\n\n6. My Mister. Not sure what to say at this point. But it's also amazing story with vivid characters.\n\n7. While you were sleeping. Watched this one long ago, but still adore. Story is truly engaging.\n\n8. Designated survivor: 60 Days. Second remake in the list! I was also about to put Life on Mars here but changed my mind haha. Anyway, great title, amazing cast. \n\n9. Hot stove league. Was surprised to see such serious Namgoong Min after Chief Kim, but he did great, as well as everyone else. Love the story and I don't even know much about baseball. \n\n10. Gaus Electronics. New entry. Enough for crying and tears. Meet a pure fun. Absurd and amazing.\n\nHonourable mentions that actually can replace Gaus, but let it be where it is: Life on Mars, Hotel del Luna, Chief Kim, Memories of the Alhambra, Live, Go Back Couple, Vincenzo.",

            "comment": "Like everyone on this page, I watched a lot of kdramas. Inhaled them. Probably skipped studying for a test to watch a kdramas. But I am picky in what I recommend to people, because I love a good story. \n\nSo here is my few recommendations that I think are a must-watch in kdrams. Proably not everyone's cup of tea, BUT I HAVE A GOD COMPLEX SO PLEASE WATCH THEM, hehe. Also, I limited my self to 12 because after breathing 0xygen, I breathe k-dramas. In no particular order: \n\n1. **My Liberations Notes:**\n   1. Slice of Life. Usually SOL is hit or a miss and this was a hit. I remmember just waiting for the next episode. It deals with problems that we (as everyday people) face: loss, gried, workplace tension, and so on. Stick with it if you are gonna watch it.\n2. **Weightlifting Fairy Kim-Bok Joon:** \n   1. Rom-Com. I MEAN THE CUTNESS, THE HUMOR, THE COUPLE. I binged this show in a day and you will to. It's just the perfect romcom in my book. Forever my favorite kdrama couple. \n3. **Hi, Bye, Mama:**\n   1. \"Rom-Com\" that is how it is categorized in Netflix and THAT IS A HUGE LIE. I cried every episode. I bawled my eyes out. It's sad and it made my mommy issues flare up (but like that's another issue). THIS I THINK EVERY KDRAMA FAN SHOULD WATCH. The story line, the characters, just everything about this drama is beautiful and heart wrenching at the same time. \n4. **Our Beloved Summer:** \n   1. Rom-Com(ish). If you are into the enemies to lovers, buckle up- this is your stop. The acting, the cinematagory- it's visual and heart warming treat. There is some cliches thrown here and there, but they are just cute. Again, this drama is not all about love, but also focuses on the individual struggles to find your identity. There is no crappy acting, it's well-rounded drama. \n5. **Because this is my first life:**\n   1. Rom-Com/Slice of Life. I thank God that I found this drama. Is one of my comfort tv shows. If you are into the fake marriages, falling in love trope- this one is for you. It's one of those drams where you can cook and watch it. It's peaceful (for the most parts). Before I write a paper, this drama is \\*chef's kiss\\*\n6. **Itaewon Class:** \n   1. Rom-Com. I mean, do I need to explain? This drama deserves the awards it got. The story, the characters, the music is amazing. The music, literally makes me feel like I can do 1000 things all that once. One thing about this drama is the little details between the FL and ML. When they start discovering the love for each other, you have observe the characters to understand them (especially the ML). Just amazing. \n7. **Mr.Queen:**\n   1. COMEDY. I-. 10/10. The humor in this drama is beyond compare. I remember refreshing the page every Sat. and Sun. for this drama. It's so funny with mystery and romance. I mean it's a package. If you were gonna watch anything of this list, I would consider this drama (and also all the others one, duh). \n8. **Tomorrow**:\n   1. I watched it for the plot. If the plot was Lee Soo-Huk. I am kidding (not really). No, but in all seriousness, this kdrama talked about a lot of heavy things- suicide, ED, mental disoders. It did not gloss over any of the mental illness (in terms of how kdrama gloss over illness) and showed the struggles the individual face. It has romance as well, but be warned, it will break your heart. Again, this drama is 10/10 . \n9. **Law School:** \n   1. THIS DRAMA. IS. SO. GOOD. I know I said that for everything else on this list, but it's because I have good taste. No, this drama is all about law. Like every ep, there is something you will learn about the law. And I love this drama because of that. There is some romance, but like law is the main focus. If you are law nerd like me (or a kdrama nerd or a human), please watch it. \n10. **Dr.John:** \n   1. Again, if Kim Ji-Sung is showing his pretty eyes, then who I am to say no to watching them? Apart from my love for Kim Ji-sung, this is a medical drama (I know your rolled your eyes- it's okay I did to). As a medical student, I loved this drama because (comparing it to other kdramas) it focused more on the hospital and medience. Also, apart from focusing on romance, it also focused heavily on familial ties, friendships, sibling bonds. This drama may not be everyone first cup of choice, but it's a worth a watch. \n11. **Move to Heaven:** \n   1. I do not know how I lived after watching this kdrama. It was sad. Like I could fill a whole water bottle worth of tears. This drama is like\"Hi, Bye, Mama\" and deals with grief. It moves your heart and I think you have to watch the drama to pull something away. Because it's personal. So, have a lot of tissues by your side and hydrate. \n12. **The Glory:** \n   1. I don't make the rules- the best drama to come out of 2023. Just the plot, the acting, the revenge. I love a girl boss moment and the my FL girl bossed for me. Just watch this. If you haven't, go watch it. \n\nOkay, there are other dramas that I like, but in terms of dramas I would recommend with my eyes closed, it would be these above. Anyway, I need more kdrama to watch and so if you think I might like something, let me know down below. \n\nThank u for coming to my ted talk!",

            "comment": "I mostly watch kdramas for the romance subplots so I figured I can do a top ten of my favorite couple/romance in the dramas I've watched. So consider this list 1-10 on that intangible fluttering feeling you get when a romance just hits the mark. Of course, happy endings are a must! These aren't in any specific order. \n\n1. **Extraordinary You**\\- While I don't think this drama was perfect, I think what kept me coming back and rewatching once (or twice) was the chemistry between Dan Oh and Ha Ru. Lots of cute moments and also existential dread when their world (literally) starts to come crashing down. \n2. **Be Melodramatic-** Specifically the storyline between Lee So Min (the actress) and Lee Min Joon (her manager). I could rewatch their scenes over and over. I'm a sucker for long-term-secretive-one-sided-(or is it?)-romance.\n3. **Father, I'll Take Care of You-** If someone ever edits this show down to just Park Eun Bin and Lee Tae Hwan's scenes I would be *so* happy. If you're going to watch this 50 episode family drama, seriously just watch their scenes- they are the cutest ever.\n4. **Thirty But Seventeen**\\- The couple from this show (Shin Hye Sun and Yang Se Jong) were hilarious but also had very touching/emotional moments. This is the kind of show that makes you happy when two very sweet people get together (finally). \n5. **Healer-** Just a classic for a reason. Ji Chang Wook and Park Min Young are the best together, their entire arc is just super satisfying. There's action and fighting but they never forget to sprinkle in romantic scenes in at the same time which I definitely appreciate. \n6. **You are the Best!**\\- I think I just enjoy Jo Jung Suk's character so much that it made the overall show palatable. But once again, if you're going to watch this long family drama, just watch his scenes with IU, they are so fun to watch, especially when he realizes he likes her and becomes bumbling/adorkable, when he tries so hard to be cool.\n7. **Mask**\\- This is NOT a romance-oriented drama but the Park Soo Ae and Joo Ji Hoon couple were amazing as a sort-of-married couple literally living in a chaebol viper pit. I think it was just super touching that he finally had someone he could finally trust and rely on.\n8. **Never Twice-** Kwak Dong Yeon gets all the credit for this one! His storyline with recently widowed-now-single-mom Park Se Wan is heartwarming. The best scenes are when he basically embraces becoming a dad to another man's child. I just wish his family wasn't terrible, but being a family drama, everyone gets redeemed at the end (yay?). \n9. **Twenty Again-** I'm pretty sure I've talked about this drama on reddit before, but it needs more love! Very sweet romance between Choi Ji Woo and Lee Sang Yoon's characters as they reconnect when she splits from her good-for-nothing husband and goes to college as an ahjumma. \n10. **Queen In Hyun's Man-** One of the first dramas I ever watched but still holds up so well. A super smart time-travelling Joseon noble meets a struggling actress in modern day. Great time-travel shenanigans and they have great chemistry. It's such a fun blend of sageuk drama/political conspiracies and the modern day life of an actress who becomes more and more famous.",

            "comment": "starting watching kdramas regularly around 2013? it's been 10 years.\n\n- **Inspector Koo** - made specifically for me. well-executed investigative drama with tons of interesting female characters. also fun editing choices and a banger soundtrack.\n- **Solomon's Perjury** - i think of it as a coming-of-age story. all the student characters are great. lee so woo &lt;/3 younger me related to you so much.\n- **Stranger** - amazing. especially the first season the plot was so tight, and characters didn't deviate from who they were. yoo jae myung made an amazing villain.\n- **Age of Youth** - slice-of-life coming-of-age i enjoyed a while ago. the ensemble cast was really great.\n- **My Liberation Notes** - commuting is hell. finally a screenwriter who understands. the rage. but anyways, it's a great story and i personally really liked the &gt;!open ending!&lt;.\n- **Circle** - thee sci-fi kdrama. the split timelines made the storytelling more interesting.\n- **365: Repeat the Year** - strangely, i don't remember much detail about this, even though i last watched this more recently than some others on this list. either way, i remember i enjoyed it. may get demoted in the future.\n- **Dear My Friends** - i remember being surprised i liked this so much b/c most of the characters are senior citizens and i was not (still am not), and i thought i would have a difficult time relating to them.\n- **Healer** - self-explanatory (people were crazy about it when it aired). i used to rewatch parts of this every once in a while.\n- **Just Dance** - another coming-of-age for my sorry ass. i think this drama fell off everyone's radar a few months after it aired, which is such a pity b/c it's such a good youth drama.",

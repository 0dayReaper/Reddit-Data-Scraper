            "comment": "**Vincenzo**\n\n**Good Things**: A stellar cast. Both the main leads and the supporting cast are what makes the show so engaging and enjoyable. A unique plot; a plot that deals with the concept of \"*un diavolo scaccia l'altro*\" (It takes a devil to drive out another devil). You'll find yourself getting to know characters that are all complex and morally grey in their own ways. Lastly, the show has developed an amazing OST and some of the best cinematography I've seen in a Kdrama. \n\n**Bad Things**: Because it is a show with 20 episodes, some scenes, and some plots may feel prolonged. I think that is the biggest issue I had with the show. Yet with patience, this show can be a very enjoyable watch. \n\n**Interesting Things**: There are many plot twists! The first one deals &gt;!with the identity of the real villain of the show!&lt;. Not only that, you'll find that the supporting cast are really crucial to the essence of this show, they bring the comedy, and build the tension of various issues and scenes throughout the show. Let's not forget that the villains of the drama are what really makes this show so entertaining, you might even find yourself rooting for them (maybe)!\n\n**Spotlight on Because**: Ok Taecyeon! I've never heard of him, and in going into this show, I *genuinely* thought he was a veteran actor. I was shocked when I found out he was an idol! He played his role phenomenally well. There are certain scenes where you can *feel* shifts in mood because of his acting (as well as the supporting cast)! I really believe that the show would not be as good and entertaining as it is without his character. All in all, I highly recommend this show to anyone who's interested in the theme of \"It takes a devil to drive out another devil.\" It's a show that will leave you laughing, crying, and above all satisfied with a cleverly developed show.",

            "comment": "**moment at eighteen**\n\n**good things**: was so much more than a typical high school romance drama. these characters were truly lived in. they were layered, real, and genuine people all dealing with realistic issues. everything felt so natural and beautifully done. the acting was amazing from all characters. \n\n**bad things**: honestly i dont remember disliking  anything. the 2ML definitely starts off as your typical annoying guy who likes the girl who doesn\u2019t like him back - but even that has depth to it.\n\n**interesting things**: i watched this a year after graduating high school. i, for one, was not the biggest high school fan but man did this drama make me miss it. it really highlights the little things &amp; moments that we dont realize impact us before they\u2019re gone in an instant.\n\n\n**spotlight on because**: ong seong woo stars as the ML here and he absolutely blows it out of the park. think about a shy &amp; introverted character who doesn\u2019t really interact with people but has so much love and care in his heart - he\u2019s just been done wrong and that\u2019s him. ASTRO\u2019s moonbin also plays a character here that touched me so deeply and his storyline was so well done. this was my introduction to astro and moonbin so im eternally thankful.",

It was really a moment of eighteen.",

            "comment": "**Dream High (2011)**\n\n**Good Things**\n\nThe cast - the idol actors were all obviously newbies then but several of them, notably IU, Suzy and Taec went on to do greater dramas. \n\nKim Soo Hyun - this was one of his early roles and the only non-idol among the young actors. And it shows, he was a fantastic actor even back then. I don\u2019t have to tell you how his career is now :)\n\nJYP - apparently this was his first acting role but he did very well. \n\nThe music - this kdrama introduced me to the world of kpop. 2pm, IU and Miss A went into my playlist, as well as some snsd, big bang and others. \n\nThe theme - while the entire drama wouldn\u2019t win an emmy, I love that it touched on a lot of things \u2014 friendship and love, the struggle to achieve your dreams especially in the entertainment industry.  They also included &gt;!sexual harassment!&lt; - back them k-bloggers mentioned they didn\u2019t expect the drama to even hint at it. \n\n\n**Bad Things**\n\nThe cast - yep, it\u2019s part of both the good and bad. Back then, a lot was said about casting kpop idols instead of actual actors. The drama could have greatly benefited from better actors, of which k-ent have no shortage of. Better actors would have elevated the material. \n\nBae Yong-joon - sorry to say but he was rather bland and cringey here. It was funny that JYP did better than him. \n\nThe story - the story is objectively shallow, but I don\u2019t mind. Skip if you are looking for the meaning of life. \n\n**Interesting Things**\n\nSee the Good Things :). This is when Kim Soo Hyun, IU, Suzy and Taec were so young, see where they are now! \n\nI didn\u2019t follow Wooyoung and Eunjung\u2019s careers but I hope they are doing well too. \n\n**Spotlight On Because**\n\nA spotlight on idol actors would be incomplete without this. I first watched it as it was airing. Last I rewatched would be a decade or so ago. Pardon if I forgot some details.",

            "comment": "**Let Me Be Your Knight**\r  \n\r  \n**Good Things:** Omg the OST is daebak! Makes me wish that this fictional idol group really exist. I have most songs and I don't skip them. The cast is young so it has a youthful vibe. Refreshing to see new faces too. Love the backstories of the various characters too\\~\r  \n\r  \n**Bad Things:** Might be considered predictable and clich\u00e9 to some people. Includes Love Triangle and Stuck Together tropes but I enjoy them.\r  \n\r  \n**Interesting Things:** Lee Jun Young speaking English! Only brief glimpses. And I realized that he didn't live abroad or had any formal training. I think he learned it from Amber and U-KISS Kevin? Liked that he made an effort to learn the language.\r  \n\r  \n**Spotlight On Because:** Lee Jun Young! I've seen him first in Avengers Social Club. And I felt that his best show is Class Of Lies. His acting is really good here. I tend to like actors who can play the role of antagonist really well. Anyway, I felt that most people know his other idol drama, Imitation (which I've watched too). But I recommend Let Me Be Your Knight over Imitation. Love the OST and characters' backstories!",

                    "comment": "I just watched this and loved it! I hope they make more idol dramas because the k-pop idol culture seems toxic to me and humanizing them could pave the way for greater fan empathy. &gt;!The ending with him buying the house was perfect, but it had to be that way because the idol world is so nuts about dating!&lt; I\u2019ve been listening to LUNA since I finished and I love the music. Lee Jun Young is a special talent- he really can do it all and I wish him the best.",

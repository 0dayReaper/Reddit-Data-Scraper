Made me laugh out loud multiple times! Very well paced without a single dull moment. The actors have done a brilliant job. A li'l romance is also thrown in. The storyline is kinda ridiculous (*ridiculously funny*), but it's a comedy so who cares. Overall such a fun watch!!! It will definitely be worth your while and will lighten your mood.\n\nRecommending it to everyone who's looking for a comedy!",

Lee Ju Hyuk\u2019s \u201cGypsophila\u201d is a soundtrack gem.\n* **Bad Things**: The mystery/crime storyline, which took valuable screen time away from the main storylines.\n* **Interesting Things**: The insights into the competitive education industry in South Korea were endlessly fascinating.\n* **Verdict**: This series is likely to be considered among the best dramas of 2023, and deservedly so.\n\n**Love to Hate You**\n\n* **Good Things**: Fantastic chemistry between the main couple, a likable second lead couple, a quirky sense of humor, and the best drama soundtrack of 2023 to date.\n* **Bad Things**: It\u2019s a slow starter, with the first two episodes not being representative of the quality of the series as a whole. Once it finds its groove from Episode 3 onwards, it\u2019s a delight to watch.\n* **Interesting Things**: The filmmakers gave Kim Ok-bin all the opportunities in the world to showcase her martial arts prowess.\n* **Verdict**: A mature romantic comedy done right.\n\n**The Glory: Part 2**\n\n* **Good Things**: A satisfying conclusion to a tremendous series featuring thrills, action, drama, and dark humor, all delivered in cinematic style.\n* **Bad Things**: Nothing really.\n* **Interesting Things**: The use of the board game Go as a metaphor for on-screen events was fascinating.\n* **Verdict**: The series that ended 2022 on such a powerful note returned to finish the job in emphatic style.",

Another regular tropey, silly romcom, but very entertaining. \n\n**bad things:** Last few episodes are draggy, the ending is fine though. \n\n**Verdict: Yes** (7.5/10)\n\n\n**2. Crash course in romance**\n\n**Good things:** The cast. The story involving education system of sk, both middle age and teenage romance and seemingly misfit mystery is interesting. The ending, though totally filler, is satisfying. \n\n**bad things:** Good acting and editing overshadowed the forced plot conveniences. Unless you are super picky, it shouldn't bother you. It is nice to cut some slacks to mindless romcoms haha. Oh, the drama glorified private academy culture. \n\n**Verdict: Yes** (8/10)\n\n\n**3. Divorce attorney shin** (currently airing 6/12) \n\n**Good things:** Perfect balance of detailed divorce cases with good focus on root causes and well timed comedy. The filler scenes are too good to be considered filler haha. Best portrayal of bromance I have seen so far. \n\n**bad things:** The drama tends to focus on divorce cases of flawed people so it can be controversial. Actually the webtoon from which it adapted the divorce cases wrote the stories by consulting real lawyers. So ignoring the obvious dramatization, they are real. \n\n**Interesting things:** Remember hwang simok? He is doing everything you can't really imagine him doing lol. ML's backstory is getting interesting. Unlike the regular law drama, most of the cases are solved during mitigation. \n\n**Spotlight on because:** Cho seung woo and the entire cast. \n\n**Verdict:** Solid **YES** even if you are not into law drama but admire coherent storytelling and natural acting. Has the potential to be one of the best dramas from this year.",

Well written characters and company politics. I have also been in two such rounds, and the atmosphere of stress was very similar, if not quite as bad at my jobs.\n\n**Bad Things:** If you are looking for a cute romcom to relax or the mental release of a good revenge, this is not it.\n\n**Interesting Things:** The system of lay-off was very different from in Norway, where the union is always involved and they rather keep those who worked there the longest. The number of industries working with electronics, since the dictatorship in Korea promoted it.  \n\n**Verdict:** Much better than I thought, and less stressful than I thought, but I did think I would be very very stressed before starting it. Probably because the drama follows people who are very smart and good at their job.",

Unlike a lot of older network dramas, it had a large enough budget to be entirely pre-produced. This allowed for the use of upper-end camera work, editing and effects that make WYWS feel much more recent than it is.\n* The hook. Contagious precognition with a butterfly effect factor is an riveting twist to a legal thriller. The first few episodes do an excellent job presenting its premise, and are overall the strongest part of the series.\n\n**So-So Things:**\n\n* The romance. Fate tells us the leads are Meant To Be and they just shrug and roll with it. There's some cute domestic/daily life moments in between the legal cases and a few pretty cinematic tableaus, but little meaningful relationship building. \n* The tone. Despite the murders, dire dreams and tragic backstories everything is light and breezy. It's understandable that people see it as a comfort watch because the entire drama - even the moments of what should be high conflict - is mostly one note. \n\n**Bad Things:**\n\n* The 2D characters. The Good Guys are Just Good; they always win and always make the right moral choices. The Bad Guys are Just Bad; they're there to move the plot along and nothing else. The lack of narrative nuance makes them all seem more like archetypes than individuals.\n* The MIA main plot. The legal cases don't share any themes or common threads, and they're unrealistically neatly tied up with any loose ends/consequences either ignored or swept away by time skips. They add nothing to the central story, which ends up endlessly sidelined until all the conflict and resolution is crammed into the final few episodes.\n\n**Interesting Things:**\n\n* Park Hye Ryun also wrote **Dream High** (2011), **I Hear Your Voice** (2013), **Pinocchio** (2014-2015) and **Start-Up** (2020).\n\n***\n\nAnd a mini review I've yet to to completely organize my thoughts on:\n\n**Nine: Nine Times Time Travel** (2013) (Scifi/Fantasy/Romance/Thriller) 8/10: A reporter gains nine magical sticks of incense that allow him to jump exactly 20 years into the past. He takes the chance to avert a tragedy, and returns to find the present changed.\n\n**Good Things**: \n\n* While it's a fantastical basis for time travel, the early parts of the story are very tight. \n* The time travel trope is somewhat unique in that time is treated like a line instead of a circle, which results in some interesting complications as a result of ML's changes.\n\n**Bad Things**: \n\n* The tropes come from an older more makjang era: faux incest romance, &gt;!surprise brain cancer!&lt; and a farcical corrupt chaebol villian who's so dramatically over the top it's hard to take him seriously.\n* The rules start to loose internal consistency and the finale is a mish-mash of hasty resolutions with a somewhat open ending.  \n\n**Interesting Things**:\n\n* Song Jae Jung also wrote **Queen In Hyun's Man** (2012), **W: Two Worlds** (2016) and **Memories of the Alhambra** (2018).\n\n***\n\nBoth are worth watching, especially if you're looking for their specific genre mix or enjoyed similar works by the same screenwriter. **Nine** absolutely made me want to re-watch **Queen In-Hyun's Man** / **W** to complete the thematic fighting-against-fate trilogy from Song Jae Jung, though IMO its the weakest of the three overall. Likewise for WYWS and **I Hear You Voice** / **Pinocchio**, which are part of Park Hye Ryun's thematic revenge thriller trilogy.",

Love **I can Hear Your Voice** and the others you mention are also high on my list. \n\nYou don't need to rate all the dramas you have seen. I only rate those I like a lot and those I hate, almost never the middle ones.",

It's hard to know authorial intent, but when dramas are written by the same writer and explore similar themes and situations they definitely feel like continuous, connected stories from a viewer standpoint.\n\nThere are some dramas I have zero desire (or time) to revisit. I chose Nine and WYWS specifically because I know I enjoyed other dramas by the same writer (IHYV is one of my perennial favorites too) and wanted to see if time and perspective had changed my initial ratings. But generally I rate anything I've watched all way through; anything I outright dislike usually ends up unrated and dropped.",

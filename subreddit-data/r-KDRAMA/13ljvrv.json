JH might be becoming a bit more like You bc of the surgery but there's no reason You's entire personality would change so drastically.!&lt; The only reason I could think of is if &gt;!JH!&lt; was the one who disappeared, would &gt;!You!&lt; blame himself and become way more withdrawn? Or start studying psychiatry bc his friend suffered from mental health issues before disappearing?\n\nThe dad getting flirtacious w the mom out of nowhere was random.\n\nAlso, this drama looooves close-up shots of clenched fists \ud83d\ude02\n\nWait, is this show really ending next week after 2 more eps? My overall feeling abt this show has been, \"that's it?\" Like it had really great potential but then it just drifted along... I'm also not used to these eps being so short.",

YT it\u2019s so intentionally misleading as camera (past-present shots dissolve into both actors and &gt;!so yeon told both guys the secret!&lt;  and why is the ep title the secret you DIDNT know? \n\n\n\nand only 2 more episodes?

            "comment": "These two episodes had much more weight to pull than they actually did. The FL is less desirable, without ever being genuinely desirable enough to put the friendship of two kids' (who underwent a kidney transplant) relationship at risk. The FL just seems annoying in the present time, and a &gt;!klepto/!&lt; pretty vanilla wafer who can turn her head from one ML to the other ML in high school time. \n\nThe progress I can make sense of seems to be &gt;!JH will forgive/overlook/try to understand  SY's kleptomania, whereas You just shuts most of it down. But then SY is waiting 17 (?) years to get a formal psych diagnosis from someone who was/is interested romantically in her (major conflict of interest). !&lt;\n\nAnyways writers, pls do better for FLs next time.",

It's ridiculous how little we know about her. If the show really is ending in 2 eps it'll be interesting to see how they wrap things up.",

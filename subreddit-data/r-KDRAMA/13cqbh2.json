    "postText": "   I went into this show with zero expectations, I found myself in a K-drama slump. After endless disappointing dramas and a few good ones, I still didn\u2019t find myself watching a drama that gave me that desperation and NEED to watch the next episode. So when I saw this on Hulu? And with the unique pinkish look? I expected to be disappointed just the same but I was wrong. \n\n   I\u2019m not the greatest person on expressing why I like a certain K-drama because it\u2019s the little things for me (so bare with me ) but for Call It Love? There\u2019s a few strong details that\u2019ll have me thinking about this drama for years. The characters? Such amazing actors, character developments and character personalities. They were consistent yet they showed growth. \n\n   Seeing a female lead who didn\u2019t hold her tongue and kind of thought without speaking which often got her misunderstood was so refreshing. Woo-joo was brash but not mean, I related to it so much because I always got told \u201cyou look mean\u201d or \u201csound mean\u201d until someone got to know me. It didn\u2019t feel like the typical cold female lead who knew exactly why or when she was being rude ..It genuinely came out unintentionally and not really meant to hurt anyone. \n\n          I love how she denied her true feelings.. Unknowingly. \n\n     It felt so real.She loved the ML but knew that she could not so she told herself and others basically..\u201dI can stop when I want\u2026I\u2019ll end it soon\u201d When deep down she never found herself doing it. She felt like such a real person instead of a character from a script . All her triumphs and failures..Even her arguments and goals..They felt real. The revenge part was so real to me because often enough, in real life? You don\u2019t get your revenge, it\u2019s so bitter and it sucks but you find yourself moving on instead of holding onto those feelings. \n\n   The male lead? Three words? A gentle giant. The fact that they casted a tall person with such a gentle soul? It fit perfectly. I don\u2019t think it would have worked if Dong-jin was a smaller or \u201cprettier\u201d guy, this guy was handsome of course but he also looked like he wouldn\u2019t take anyone\u2019s b.s \u2026Mind you I watched Kim-Young Kwang  in \u201cSomebody\u201d. So I just love the duality. \n\n     I was surprised to see him so willing , forgiving and almost non confrontational. \n\n    Dong-jin was so gloomy and depressing similar to a black cat, like they described in the drama. I thought he would get on my nerves and I would feel annoyed by him similar to how the female lead did in the beginning but just like her I found myself wanting to protect him immediately. The way they expressed his sadness, the way he walks, his expressions and way of speaking was done perfectly\u2026And his change or even resolve to do better was not over night because at the end of the day that\u2019s just truly who he is . \n\n    She never worried about her words hurting others so she said whatever popped in her head, and he worried so much about how others would feel he kept it to himself. I love this dynamic between them. \n\n     I know there\u2019s a lot of dramas with cold female leads and soft male leads but nothing quite like this.I wish I could explain it better but if you watched it or plan to watch it then hopefully you would understand. Woo-joo anger was so real but misplaced, and her trying to rationalize and justify felt so human \u2026Like I never once got angry at her, just sad.  \n\n  Now for my favorite part which is going to **shock** everyone but the break up scene. \n\n  I know people hate break up scenes and I hate them as well but this one felt different. They were so understanding and so loving, they show you that it hurts to love and that even when someone you loved hurts you, you can\u2019t just let them go or be angry because of how much love they have given you. I feel like dramas handle betrayal and deception too easily and this one didn\u2019t . \n\n   With how personal their breakup scene felt , it was like watching two real life couples and I was ease dropping from a bush or something. It hurt so bad because the person you love has hurt you but it hurts even more cause you love them too much to care. The icing on the cake was the FL acknowledging this and wanting him to be angry at her for deceiving him instead of just accepting she made a mistake\u2026It was a really beautiful scene. \n\n   I came here solely to talk about the main characters but some other details I loved about this drama . \n\n\n      -Great FULLY platonic relationships.\n\n      - Realistic bad/good parents shown. \n\n      - The unique way of shooting and directing. I loved the shots of the male lead walking away. \n\n     - THE CAMPING SCENES! \n\n     -A tomboy FL who isn\u2019t styled like she got dressed in the dark. Tomboy does not mean bad outfits and bad haircuts.",

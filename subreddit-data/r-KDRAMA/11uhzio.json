    "postText": "Welcome to the biannual **Share Your Kdrama Related Resource** post!\n\nThis is a place to share any resources or subreddits you have created or just ones that you enjoy perusing that relate in some way to Kdramas. These resources may be dedicated to specific kdramas, specific celebrities, or more general k-entertainment.\n\nExamples of things that you can share here -- subreddits, podcasts, blogs, websites, YouTube channels, spotify playlists, instagrams, etc. \n\n**Please note:** Any links to sites with personal sales of goods and merchandise or crowdfunding will be removed as per our [self promotion rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_3.7_self_promotion.2C_business_promotion.2C_petitions). \n\n**Some Suggested Resources**\n\n* **[MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/)** provides basic information about kdramas including its cast, production, broadcast information, and streaming information. The website is free to use and you can create a profile to track what you have watched and also create custom lists for organization. User reviews and ratings are also available.\n\n* **[AsianWiki](http://asianwiki.com/)** provides basic information about kdramas including its cast, production, broadcast information. Note that its cast lists may be more helpful because they are screenshots from the drama so the cast pictures are directly from the drama instead of profile pictures, which may look very different from their characters in the drama. This may be more helpful in identifying actors/actresses.\n\n* **[DramaWiki](https://wiki.d-addicts.com/Category:Lists)** maintains lists of dramas broadcasted and OSTs by year.\n\n* **[Korean Dramaland](https://koreandramaland.com/)** provides information about filming locations seen in kdramas. You can search by a specific drama (to see the locations used in that drama) or by a location (to see all the dramas that have filmed there). They also include overseas locations. They are a still growing site and constantly adding new locations, you can contribute to it too to help it grow!\n\n* **[Soompi](https://www.soompi.com/)** provides the latest news on the K-entertainment world, including kdramas, k-movies and kpop. They are owned by Viki. Generally they cover all casting information so they are a good resource for casting news.\n\n* **[Dramabeans](http://www.dramabeans.com/)** provides detailed recaps of dramas and the latest news on kdramas. They are one of the oldest blogs/sites around and have an extensive collection of drama recaps (episode by episode, with screencaps). The original authors also have ratings on dramas they have watched so if you are considering whether to watch an older drama or not, it can be helpful to check the ratings or recap. Find that information on their [Resources page](http://www.dramabeans.com/resources/). \n\n*Disclaimer*: We are not affiliated with any of these resources and are highlighting them only for informational purposes.\n\n**Reason for SYKRR to exist!**\n\nAs you should know, r/KDRAMA has extensive [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) in place to govern what type of content is posted in our community.\n\nThis post aims to help our users who wish to find alternate subreddits to discuss k-entertainment areas that we don't allow on /r/KDRAMA and /r/kdramarecommends. \n\nThis post also gives users a chance to share resources they have found or personal projects relating to K-dramas that they work on. \n\n**DISCLAIMERS**: **All resources shared in comments to this post are not vetted or checked in any manner by the Mod Team^(TM)**, explore them at your own risk. Resources in comments to this post are not affiliated with r/KDRAMA or r/kdramarecommends. The Mod Team^TM does not vouch for or endorse any of the items shared in comments to this post.",

I watch 99% of my kdramas in original language with subs, but sometimes it just feels nice  to have the option to kinda space out while watching a kdrama... also I remember vividly how frustrated I was at first not being able to find much with English dubs, the choice seemed almost nonexistent 2 years ago. While I do totally agree that watching in original language is better, I also totally understand why some people might want to have the dubbed content.\n\nSo... the list is [here](https://mydramalist.com/list/LQJDAe83): https://mydramalist.com/list/LQJDAe83",

Anyway, if you are late to the party, it might be worth it to check if the drama you became obsessed with has a sub. \n\nThere have been several subs started by people who think the moderation in this sub is too strict, but it seems that they have quietly died. Most of us are happy with the strictness, I guess.",

We keep giving this advice and yet so few people take us up on it *shrugs*.",

Last year, Squid Game lost to itself in the same categories it won Emmy\u2019s for. These productions are more than just acting/writing/directing and I hopefully thought that a drama like Squid Game winning technical accolades internationally would inspire them to also recognize more of the technical aspects of Korean film/tv.",

            "comment": "I've been watching Good Job with Kwon Yu Ri and Jung Il Woo, a somewhat goofy but totally fun show about a chaebol heir/detective played by JIW who hires a part timer (KYR) to help him uncover the truth behind his mother's murder. The plot line does into swerve into silliness but those two have great chemistry just like they did in Bossam Steal the Fate. They look like they're having fun. Kwon Yu Ri played such a sweet and dignified Princess in Bossam and she's equally likeable here. And Jung Il Woo has a certain something that makes him \"sekshi\".\n\nGood Job is such a fun break where I can just giggle at their antics compared to Taxi Driver 2 which can get a bit intense. As are the reality shows Peak Time and Boys Planet which showcase male idol talent. It's staggering just how good some of the contestants are and I wonder if it's a case of \"peak idol\" where the ecosystem is just too saturated and the path to stardom will be littered with broken performers' hearts left and right. \n\nI can't help but root for all those gifted contestants who are pouring out their hearts and souls in an industry that can end up crushing them to dust -- not through any lack on their part but only because there's limited room at the top. For example, would the unique genius and charm of BTS have been recognized and given a chance if they were newbie contestants in Peak Time?",

I'm an older stan, so there's tons of older groups that didn't do well by standards nowdays, such as releasing 2-3 albums or winning awards, that are still fondly remembered. Heck even going farther back, KBS posted videos of groups I've barely heard of like The Turtles that get 5mil+ views. \n\nBTS debuted at that sweet spot where even idols from smaller companies could get opportunities, such as BAP or Block B, yet they had enough competition that they needed to put in their A game to stay. I couldn't really see a group have that kind of leeway today.",

Shin Sung Han is an interesting character and his story is keeping me invested. FL, for me, is the weakest part of the show.\n\n**Call It Love** (7/16): Agreeing with everyone that this very slow burn romance is amazing. Both lead actors are great, but I\u2019m especially impressed with Lee Sung Kyung. They make the pain and loneliness of their characters so palpable. I love the scene at the end of episode 7 when Shim Woo Joo &gt;! Is starting to realize her feelings, but not fully. \u201cI just worry about him a little bit more. I just wish he could be a little less lonely. What is this feeling? The delivery of those lines is just pitch perfect!&lt;",

            "comment": "I am watching **Mr. Sunshine** (18/24) and it has no business being that good. That is a firm 10/10 for me.\u00a0 Here is a list of things I like about this show: \n\n1 .  Lee Byung-hun is amazing in pretty much everything and Mr. Sunshine has a lot of him. He can just be staring blankly into the camera and it feel like a powerful moment. Having so much screen presence should be illegal.\n\n\n2 .  All other actors are amazing as well. From the cast of 5 main characters, each actor and acress has enough magnetism to carry a show by themselves. \n\n3 .  Both the music and the cinemography are amazing. Only the combination of these two in some scenes can give me shivers. \n\n4 . All the 5 main characters are increadibly interesting.\u00a0 At first, I thought that I wouldn't like Hui-Seong, but he ended up growing on me. Now, I wouldn't be able to choose a favorite among the 5. \n\n5 . The characters are multilayers and, even if they do some actions that are hard to justify, I always understand how they came to develop their worldview. And frankly, I can't blame them. \n\n6 .  Sorry ML and FL, but my favorite relationship by far is between Dong-Mae, Yoo-Jin and Hui-Seong. Every time these 3 are on screen, the result is amazing. It is a mix between comedy, threats, chemistry, sarcasm and hidden sympathy. I would love to watch a buddy comedy with these three, something like \"Dong-Mae, Yoo-jin and Hui-Seong go camping\". \n\n7 . Comedy bits in this show are very well done and some made me laugh out loud, For example, the scenes &gt;!when the translators fights because they are afraid of translating what is being said and when the drunk Hui-Seong tried to befriend Dong-Mae and Yoo-Jin!&lt; were hilarious. \n\n8 . The show offers an interesting lens on colonization and identity. It conveys a lot of ideas and emotions related to these concepts. \n\nHere are some interesting quotes from the show on these topics: \n\nKudo Hina ep 10 \"If something goes amiss with the U.S., then they\u2019ll call him a Korean. If things go wrong with Joseon, then they\u2019ll call him an American. He\u2019s simply a lonely foreigner.\" \n\nDong-Mae ep 12 \"Foreigners of the East and the West gathering to worry about Joseon's fate, I guess, that's what we call peace.\" \n\nYoo-Jin ep 5 \"It is not because you are weak. Joseon is weak right now... Your country will not protect you but my country will protect me.\" \n\n9 . Joseon is portrayed as being plagued by both internal and external problems. The prevalence of internal injustices puts into question the benefit of defending the whole system.\u00a0 Yet, while raising these uncomfortable questions, the show never feels pushy or preachy. Rather, each character navigates this question on their own terms and reaches their own conclusions. \n\nInteresting quote \n\nYoo-Jin ep 10 &gt;!\"This country you are trying to protect. Who is it for? Is there a place for butchers? Is there a life for slaves?\"!&lt;\n\n\nCon: \n\nProbably the only thing that I am not crazy about in this show are the characters of Ea-shin's servants. I love the actress playing Haman Daek, but I feel that she is meant to be a comic relief, yet none of the jokes land... Idk, I feel like if they are out of place here, but really that is a tiny detail.\n\n\nOuf... I am at ep 18, so I wanted to share my thought on the show before sh*t will hit the fan and I feel that it will hit the fan hard. I just hope that they will not go for a full-blown tragedy and will keep some of the characters alive and well.",

Despite knowing all the reveals, I have to say that the build up to the reveal of the \"initial\" lie still had me holding my breath and my heart pounding.\n\nAlso the *romance* -- the romance in this drama *kills* me because of how understated and sincere it is. I've come to realize that while I really enjoy the romances with sizzling chemistry on occasion (*Dali and Cocky Prince*, *Good Job*, and *Her Private Life* come to mind as examples), the romances that linger in my heart are the ones that are understated and cautious. The ones where I might not get any skinship other than holding hands or an embrace yet these simple acts of skinship feel reverent and precious.\n\nSo happy the drama has held up on rewatch as I'm always afraid to discover a beloved drama is no longer as beloved on second watches!",

She was now more So Yong than Bong Hwan and I guess the shift to her female identity helps to facilitate the romance parts in the latter half of the drama. \n2. I think they weren\u2019t really cousins but also it was kind of normal/accepted back in those days and it seemed preferred in some cases for power/politics. I\u2019ve seen a lot of dramas where the mother would try to strengthen power relations through marrying her son to his cousin on her side (maternal cousin). I think also there\u2019s sometimes differences between maternal and paternal cousins but I\u2019m not too sure.",

But moralising doesn't work very well. That is why we have created the power balance in the modern countries, between the voters, the justice system and those who write the laws. (What is a bit lacking in Norway now is the understanding that people also have to be active in the political parties, because the political class has become a class of its own also here. Only four percent of the population are members of a party. And many don't really understand how things work.)",

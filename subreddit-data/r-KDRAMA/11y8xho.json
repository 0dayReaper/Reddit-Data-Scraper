            "comment": "Went to watch the trailer for **Goblin** (2016/2017, on Viki) and accidentally started the first episode. Opening credits hooked me, uh oh. I wasn\u2019t intrigued by the trailer but it\u2019s so strongly recommended by so many that it was on my watch list and I had intended to save it for later. \n\nCurrently on episode 14. \n\nOK, it\u2019s really good. It is just so overall well done that the total greatness of the show overcomes some of its issues. The whole really is so much more than the sum of the parts, and that\u2019s difficult to achieve. \n\nThe chemistry between the ML and FL is\u2026 meh\u2026 but given their age differences it seems appropriate to not have sexual tension or physical contact so it kinda works. FL\u2019s immaturity is annoying but age-appropriate, and I\u2019m glad her character gets minimized in a lot of ways. ML must have near-zero sex drive at baseline given his obvious lack of experience with women at 900+ years old. \n\nI like the SML\u2019s romance storyline even though I\u2019m expecting it to not work out in the end. It\u2019s rare for me to be OK with none of the romances working out, if that\u2019s what ends up happening. There\u2019s so much to the story that it would be OK either way. \n\nBest bromance I\u2019ve seen in a kdrama, hands down. ML basically has some kind of bromance with every male in his life. The tapestry of bromance is a huge part of what makes this show so good. \n\nCasting of Kim Min Jae as the young king was so on point. In my mind I said, \u201cOh of course they had that guy play the king,\u201d as soon as I saw him. \n\nSoundtrack is well done and music is mostly excellent. There\u2019s one singer whose voice totally annoyed me but everything else musically was so, so good. \u201cBeautiful\u201d by Crush was already on my playlist without me realizing it was on this soundtrack. \n\nOverall production value is excellent, good cinematography, set design, lighting, pacing, etc. Someone in costume *really* loves men in sweaters and long cardigans which was low-level amusing but not annoying. I really like the styling for Grim Reaper SML.",

I really liked the ML, and really liked when the camera would pan to his face and you could just tell how absolutely enamored he was with the FL. I also really enjoyed when he was trying to woo the FL but didn\u2019t want to tell her that that\u2019s what he was doing, so she kept just thinking he was taking her out for work things, those scenes always made me giggle! \n\nHowever, I did get really tired of the constant miscommunication between all the characters! It was constant with both the ML and FL, and the SML and the SFL. It just got very exhausting and really took away some of my enjoyment. \n\nBut overall, it was a cute drama and I\u2019m glad to finally have watched it.",

I think I'll really enjoy this one, fingers crossed! Sometimes it is nice to have just a fun, romantic show to unwind with.\n\nWok of Love- Junho. Need I say more? I'm going through this show slowly but not because I don't like it. I actually like it a lot, but it is taking me awhile to get through it just because other shows have hooked me more.\n\nJinny's Kitchen- Um, this show is amazing. It is the ultimate comfort show and just so dang sweet and wholesome. Its probably my favorite thing I'm watching right now just because of how it makes me feel when I'm watching it.

            "comment": "True Beauty has turned me into a Moon Ga-Young enjoyer \ud83d\ude05 Watched nothing but MGY dramas after it. Unfortunately I can also kind of see now why she's known to have a \"script curse.\"\n\n\\---\n\n**The Interest of Love (16/16):** A series like this is quite rare in that there's a specific way to appreciate it. Unlike most stories that in one way or another fit the hero's journey (which requires a viewer to get invested on a character's growth to work), this feels more like an essay or a documentation of an experiment. The experiment being: get four people that cover the entire spectrum of economic standing--from the poor and debt-ridden to the top 1% of society--pit them in a love square and ~~let chaos ensue~~ observe what happens. There is almost no character development; each \"variable\" in the experiment is pretty much working with their arsenal of childhood experiences, traumas, insecurities and coping mechanisms they've accumulated prior to the start of the story. Their outlook in life and romance can be associated with their backgrounds (although Sooyoung has so many layers). These four folks are flawed, like **flawed** flawed, and viewers will need to be intentional in empathizing with them especially when their defining moments are sometimes their deplorable ones &gt;!(like Mikyung \"buying\" people's affection out of habit, Jeonghyun living off Sooyoung while being complacent in his studies, not to mention Sangsoo and Sooyoung's peak romantic moment was a result of their peak unfaithfulness from their actual partners)!&lt;. It's a harsh reminder that while not all reasons behind people's actions are valid, the emotions still are. The series is not something I'd describe as \"good\" right away, but it was definitely a unique experience. It's one of the greatest dramas I'll never watch again.\n\n**Find Me In Your Memory (32/32):** A solid 6 out of 10. While the premise was interesting, the execution was quite tropey. I found Kim Dong-wook's performance as a romantic lead a bit short. There wasn't enough demonstration of Jeonghoon's superpower, and it was often brought up just to support motivational spiels about good and bad memories. Some parts of the story are quite slow, but thankfully the series' beautiful and positive messages were enough to carry me through.\n\n**Link: Eat, Love, Kill (16/16):** Is it just me, or does Studio Dragon have a penchant for making visually amazing series but with snooze-inducing story pacing? I felt the same in *The Uncanny Counter* and a little in *Twenty Five, Twenty One*. This series was a massive waste of potential. There's such a solid story here, but it's so sluggishly told until around Episode 7, and after it peaks in the middle the pace slowly gets lousy towards the end. I love the premise so much--it was a perfect setting to tell stories about how a community can affect a child's upbringing, and the idea that every resident of the village is in their own way complicit to a child's disappearance is such a cool way to drive that point home. It's like a darker version of the anime Anohana with a bigger ensemble of characters. But so many unnatural things hamper the storytelling. First, they dumb down the police. (*The Killer's Shopping List* suffers the same situation... coincidentally, the child actor for Gyeyoung is also there) Later, they dumb down the leads (like c'mon, any person thinking straight wouldn't think of walking alone in dark alleys at night with a serial killer on the loose). The \"link\" mechanic also gets forgotten for a few episodes. Then Dahyun suddenly pulls off a Yeo Hajin &gt;!(selective amnesia)!&lt;\\--it makes sense with the character's traumatic history but it was abruptly introduced. Sometimes it feels like the two leads take the spotlight for too long that the story would benefit from promoting Ji Wontak and even Lee Jingeun into leads--after all, the four of them were the cursed children of Jihwa-dong, and the entire community was a central figure to their developmental years. The flaws in the series don't come from a bad story, just from some bad writing. That's why I hope someone picks this up for a remake, much better if it were an anime or a webcomic.\n\n\\---\n\nCan anyone recommend a good MGY series? Or a good mystery series with a romance subplot for the leads?",

It's so intense and suspenseful and the acting and the atmosphere are to die for.  I can see why it got the ratings it did in Korea.  Cannot recommend this highly enough.  \n\n**Memories of the Alhambra** (8/16): Picked this up after loving **W: Two Worlds.** I like the premise and Hyun Bin's performance but this lacks the quick pace and narrative propulsion of W: Two Worlds.  The FL also doesn't feel like an actual lead character, she's not well integrated into the plot.\n\n**Legend of the Blue Sea** (6/20): I needed more Jun Ji Hyun after **My Love from the Star.**  This show is really cute and charming and she's great.\n\n**The Heavenly Idol** (10/12): Now that it's almost over I can say I'm bit disappointed with how this show turned out in terms of its messy overarching plot and weak world building (I think a lot of the problems stem from how super lame the villain is) but I stuck with it because I do really love the leads individually and as a pair and a lot of the humor in the earlier episodes worked for me.  I just hope the shows gives them an emotionally satisfying ending.\n\n**Pandora: Beneath the Paradise** (4/16): Enjoying this a lot so far.  It's very fast paced and exciting and I'm eager to see where it's going to go.",

The premise is cute, the cast is cute, the setting is cute: a good place for a breather between episodes of *Healer*, in which I am on Episode 4 and totally enthralled, it is just as good as everyone said it is.  And the cast, wow!\n\nAlso watching *Lighter and Princess,* a very strong cast and the story seems good but it is so long, I just know their agony will go on and on and on. Taking a week off. To balance this one, I watched *Wednesday 3:30PM*, a short rom that was recommended here somewhere and I found it a good, very enjoyable comfort watch. \n\nJust beginning *Hi Venus*, seems well done workplace rom with no surprises, also found it here, thank you all!  \n\nJust finished *Secret Garden,* never found the garden but liked this one a lot. Every trope is well covered by an unusual cast, very welcome in a world of relentlessly pretty. Some parallels to *Love to Hate You* which I also enjoyed. One trope I really hate here is an unredeemably snobby mother, so boring and over.\n\nI have watched some Thai BL lately began *My Engineer*, college story, seems very typical of the casting there. Am trying to track down Japan's *Cherry Magic* which has been blocked for me in the US. Oh well.",

It makes me regret dropping it after watching the first two episodes when it aired ... because the following episodes were muuuch better. The whole cast was great. Not just the leads, but the supporting actors, too. I especially enjoyed the last few episodes. The finale was not to my taste, but it wasn't bad or anything. Some things could've been avoided, and I can tell they just wanted a dramatic ending, so it didn't completely fit. That said, I had so much fun that I could overlook that. 10/10. It's one of my favorites now. Not top 10, but it's close.\n* **Kill It (12/12)** \u2014 This drama was not for me, but I pushed through because of the KDC. Was not a fan of the ML, but Nana is so gorgeous and she was the highlight actress here. I also found the ending to be very fitting. I like how the ML stayed true to himself. I can see this falling into a bad writer's hands and the ending flipping on its head because they'd make the ML weak-willed. Not this guy, though. Tentative 3/10, maybe. Was not for me, but I enjoyed a few things.\n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n* **Our Blooming Youth (14/20)** \u2014 How is this 20 episodes, and how is nothing happening?\n* **Kokdu: Season of Deity (15/16)** \u2014 One more episodes, and it's airing soon. Let's go! Let's get this over with. \n* **Taxi Driver 2 (8/16)** \u2014 I found out why I'm not into this season as much as the previous. It's because I don't care for the victims. Before, I felt sympathy. I felt attached enough to want justice. This time, I feel nothing. Someone also said that this season feels more like a comedy than a thriller, and they're so right.\n* **Kingdom 2 (4/6)** \u2014 My anxiety is through the roof. My goodness is this a great zombie + political show.",

I really dislike watching innocent people being tortured. I can get through it, but I see it more like a step I need to go through in order to see the rest of the show. In addition, the victim of the first episode was a person with cognitive disabilities, so it hit the bull's eye of things I don't want to see happen.\n\nMy husband finished the first season and loved it. He has been continually asking me about when the 2nd season is coming out.\n\nHowever, after watching with him the first 3 episodes of S2, I am actually really enjoying it. The cases I have seen are not as poignant, but I like it exactly like that.\n\nActually, I am enjoying it so much that I wonder if I should come back to S1. \ud83e\udd14",

I wish there was a better balance this season. I think it would've been nice to keep more of the darker stories like in S1 but then tone it out with the added humor in S2.  I actually do like the added humor in S2, especially seeing the Rainbow Taxi gang joking around and interacting with each other more, but I think it's needs that added grittiness as well.",

In my eyes he's irredeemable and the cherry on top that made me determine his irredeemability is that he &gt;!killed a child. He killed a child for not being envious, a very good child. I cannot forgive him for that no matter what he does. I also cannot forgive him for killing Father Ko, wasn't it enough that his father ruined Detective Ko and Father Ko's family? He had to kill Father Ko too? And I cannot forgive him for killing the grandma and the cat either. No matter how many psychos he kills, he's like them or worse. He doesn't have any moral high ground to judge anyone.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I don't care if he cries or if he feels conflicted, those aren't his feelings, those are Yo Han's (Yo Han deserved better). Bareum's true self is pure evil. He's not some poor boy, he's a monster. The only thing I was rooting for him to do was killing Han Seo Joon and he did so I'm satisfied about that.!&lt;\n\nI also found Bong Yi extremely annoying during the whole show &gt;!and I truly hated her when I thought she had killed Yo Han. She was so quick to judge Ms. Choi and at the end she was the one who got involved with the killer of her grandma, that's what I call divine punishment.!&lt;\n\nAt the end I must confess that despite my efforts not to, I felt a bit sorry for Bareum, but only a bit, I won't ever be able to truly forgive him nor to truly sympathise with him. Most of the time I was completely indifferent whenever he &gt;!suffered or cried but towards the end I started feeling a bit of pity for him. I think his punishment and his ending was fair.!&lt;\n\nThe one I truly sympathised and felt really sorry and great empathy for was &gt;!Yo Han, my poor sweet boy, he didn't deserve to have such a terrible life. Why do good people get the short end of the stick? It is so unfair, that poor boy deserved everything good in the world. May his son have a happy life in his behalf (and Bong Yi can rott for wishing ill to his baby).!&lt;",

The series was stressful to watch at times because the characters kept putting themselves into one dangerous situation after another. The scenes involving &gt;!Mr. Lee!&lt; seemed to be operating on a different level of violence than the other scenes. Finally, the amount of swearing seemed out of all proportion to the context. Indeed, on one or two occasions, I found myself inadvertently *laughing* at the subtitles, which obviously wasn\u2019t the desired effect.\n\nOverall, it was a mixed bag, but it had its moments, and the finale was the strongest episode of the series.",

And it's all it's expected to be! I love the 5 main leads and the other actors and stories are also really good. The icing on the cake is the band and their performances in almost every episode. As a musician, I know the joy of playing music with others and this drama conveys that beautifully. It's even better to know that they are all accomplished doctors and surgeons who find their release and healing in music. I love that! I'm only on episode 5, but I'm going to stick with this and the next season and enjoy it!\n\nStarted the second installment of **The Glory.** It's already really, really violent and I must admit I get upset with that. I can stomach a bit, but the graphic violence and showcasing of the very worst in human beings is not pleasant to watch. This was my comment about Squid Game. Hmmm, both of these are on Netflix, which caters to a mre international audience. Why do people need to have this odd voyeuristic enjoyment of violence? I don't want to fill my psyche with it. I love the lead actors but I'm not sure I'll finish this. \n\nStill watching **My Heavenly Idol** and **Our Blooming Youth,** although now that I'm into Hospital Playlist these are both on hold. \n\nI finished one of my many rewatches of Gobin this week. This time I shared it over zoom with a good friend in Mexico. She loved it. Still in the aura of it, I've watched the first couple of episodes of **Touch Your Heart.** (A rewatch, of course) This is so soothing to me, especially after something heavy. \n\nThere are so many new dramas coming out this spring. **The Real** \\+ many more.

Had I not expected that, I might have been more bothered by it.\n\nI've watched three episodes of **Mr. Sunshine**, and so far am finding it compelling. The cinematography is on another level! Whether it will keep my attention for a full 24 episodes remains to be seen, and I understand it's a fairly heavy drama.\n\n**Unlock my Boss** (5/12). This one is intriguing and funny and fast paced. The premise is bizarre, but I'm finding it enjoyable--especially since **Mr. Sunshine** has a reputation for being heavy. \n\nI binged a C-drama, **Why Women Love**. Well, I fast forwarded a lot after episode 10 or so. Love the main love line. The couple have crazy chemistry. I wasn't as interested in the side stories. It's *relatively* short at 24 (?) episodes of about 40 minutes. \n\nI'm also catching up with **Picard** on Paramount. I don't love season 2, but hear season 3 gets better. Season 2 seems a bit like The Odyssey, in the sense that a series of complications arise to make it harder for the team to defeat the villain and accomplish their goal. Some of the complications don't seem organic to the story. \n\nI'm contemplating **Heavenly Idol** or **Dinner Mate** as a counterbalance to the seriousness of **Mr. Sunshine** and the high concept, somewhat violent for my taste **Unlock My Boss.** Any thoughts?",

Lovely premise so far and its interesting watching 2 members of the same KPop group be into one another. For their sake I want this one to be a huge success. Not terrible so far.\n\n**All the Liquors** (6/8) \u2014 BL \u2014 Liquor salesman/advertiser and a chef that serves no alcohol in his restaurant. Easy to watch, actors are cute, simple and straight forward plot so far. Better than \"Individual Circumstances\" by a lot. And Kim Jun Hyung has the most amazing lips. Hopefully something happens in these last two episodes.\n\n**Call it Love** (10/16) \u2014 This slow melodrama is awesome. I don't even have enough words to describe this one. I love this one so much.\n\n**Our Dating Sim** (4/8) \u2014 BL \u2014 another adorable BL couple. It's short and fluffy but the premise is one of the leads had a crush on the other in high school, confessed, then ran away before he could hear an answer. Years later, the crush hires the first for a video game project. They are doing a decent job with the story telling considering the short run times.\n\n**Unconventional Love Story** (2/10) \u2014 BL \u2014 I loved the manhwa! This one is going to have some great story telling assuming they stick close to the source material, and so far they have.\n\n**The Glory** (2/16) \u2014 I have loved this so far - revenge dramas are amazing - but my gosh is it heavy! Going to be awhile on this one as I don't think I can binge it.\n\n**The Heavenly Idol** (8/12) \u2014 Put on the back burner again. Been busy.\n\n**Jinny\u2019s Kitchen** (2/10) \u2014 Super entertaining. And all of the actors are getting (or are already there) too famous for this. But it's fun to watch. I keep seeing funny memes online so I really want to catch up but those episodes are so long and I have had other stuff to do!\n\nCompleted:\n\n**Hotel Del Luna** \u2014 I kept stopping after every episode to think about it so it took about 2 weeks to watch this. I expected the ending and wasn't surprised at all. I really enjoyed this one so much!\n\n**The End of the World With You or Bokura no Micro na Shuumatsu**  \u2014 Japanese BL \u2014 I loved this show. One of the leads starts as a total bastard but shows some serious growth. It ends up being a super cute show. And intimacy (plus sex scenes) in Japanese dramas are amazing. So very good at it without showing a lot. In other words a lot of countries could learn from them.\n\n**Bed Buddy** \u2014 Thailand BL \u2014 The best BL ever. Cute characters, no dumb tropes, great story. Can't recommend it enough.\n\nNon-Korean:\n\n**A Boss and a Babe** (3/12) \u2014 Thailand BL \u2014 they are adorable! One lead is an absolute dum dum and the other is so incredibly bold that somehow it totally works. It's fluffy and fun which is more than enough.\n\n**Bed Friend** (5/10) \u2014 Thailand BL \u2014 This last episode (#5) was my favorite in the entire series so far. It was all about turning their relationship into \"we are no longer friends with benefits\". So much intimacy and unsaid scripted story. NetJames are so freaking good. So good.\n\n**Jack o\u2019Frost** (5/6) \u2014 Japanese BL \u2014 couple just breaks up when one has an accident and can\u2019t remember the other at all. So of course the one tries to win his partner back and make him fall in love again. Very cute so far and this couple does such a good job making sure you blame both of them for their issues. Can't wait to see how they solve this.",

The humour didn't hit with me, the action eas lackluster, thr characters didn't jel with me at all, and the story was so boring.",

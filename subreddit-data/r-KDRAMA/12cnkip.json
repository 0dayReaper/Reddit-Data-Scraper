    "postText": "Miss Me? Heh.\n\nWell, I'm back with more brackets for you. I know March Madness is over but I've been a bit busy (and a lil lazy) to start if off but finally here I am. For this year, we are doing more fun/genre or actor-specific categories. We will be covering dramas that premiered on either 2020, 2021 or 2022.\n\nWe are going to start off with the favourite couple. This does not has to be a romantic pairing. It can be a M/F, M/M or F/F couple. So a bromance or a sismance is counted too. It does has to be just between 2 people. So any triangle or square have to be submitted separately.\n\nI will be leaving it up for a few days. Once I see there's enough entrants and/or not much submissions coming in, I will close the nomination round and it will move on to elimination rounds. This is where you can vote for as many of your favourites. The number of votes will determine the seeding and thus be appropriately matched once bracket formally starts.\n\nFeel free to give suggestions/recommendations or just have a discussion on this.\n\nJust to recap, these were the Top 10 seed for the 2010s dramas.\n\n1. Ri Jung Hyuk &amp; Yoon Se Ri  - Crash Landing on You\n2. Gu Seung Jun &amp; Seo Dan - Crash Landing on You\n3. Kim Bok Joo &amp; Jung Joon Hyung - Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo\n4. Sunny &amp; Grim Reaper - Goblin\n5. Kim Mi So &amp; Lee Young Joon - What's Wrong with Secretary Kim\n6. Do Bong Soon &amp; Ahn Min Hyuk - Strong Woman Do Bong Soon\n7. Sung Duk Mi &amp; Ryan Gold - Her Private Life\n8. Seo Dae Young &amp; Yoon Myung Joo - Descendants of The Sun\n9. Choi Ae Ra &amp; Ko Dong Man - Fight For My Way\n10. Kim Shin &amp; Ji Eun Tak - Goblin\n\nFor the bracket itself, the winner was Ri Jung Hyuk &amp; Yoon Se Ri  - Crash Landing on You. Runner-up was Kim Bok Joo &amp; Jung Joon Hyung - Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo. Making the semis were Gu Seung Jun &amp; Seo Dan - Crash Landing on You &amp; Sunny &amp; Grim Reaper - Goblin. Making the quarters were Choi Ae Ra &amp; Ko Dong Man - Fight For My Way, Kim Mi So &amp; Lee Young Joon - What's Wrong with Secretary Kim, Sung Duk Mi &amp; Ryan Gold - Her Private Life &amp; Do Bong Soon &amp; Ahn Min Hyuk - Strong Woman Do Bong Soon.\n\nHead [here](https://animebracket.com/favourite-kdrama-couple-from-2020-2021-2022/nominate) to nominate your favourite couples.

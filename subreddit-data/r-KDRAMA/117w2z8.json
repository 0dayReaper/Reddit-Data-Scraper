    "postText": "[Hello](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) and welcome to Kim Tan's Talk Time (Tuesday)! \n\nThis is a free-for-all discussion in which *almost* anything goes, don't diss *The Heirs* or break any of our other core rules. General discussion about anything and everything is allowed. \n\nConsider this post a refuge from all the memes and fanart that are  pouring in and enjoy the peace and quiet. Think of it as Tan's family  wine cellar, [the perfect place to chill out from the world](https://i.imgur.com/ZbVbp0Z.png) in a fabulous sweater and have a little chat.\n\n**Who is this Kim Tan I keep hearing about and why does he have not one, but two threads dedicated to him?** Good questions. If you take a look through our [glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions), you will find all the answers you seek;\n\n&gt;**KIM TAN** is the lead male in [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA)\u2019s favourite drama, [The Heirs](https://mydramalist.com/6640-the-heirs). He\u2019s kind of the worst but he has great sweaters so it balances out. \u201cKim Tan\u201d is used in three ways on [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA); 1) when referring to [Lee Min Ho\u2019s](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) seminal character in *The Heirs*, 2) when referring to Automod (alt. [Tan Bot](https://i.redd.it/qr33zzkhwgg31.gif))   - \u201cKim Tan is feeling very triggered by my post\u201d, \u201cS\\*\\*\\*!

Like the phrase \u201cdo you wanna come in and eat ramen\u201d could be interpreted and changed to \u201cdo you wanna Netflix and chill.\u201d I don\u2019t like it much but it makes sense.

Subtitles are there to make viewers understand things but I was there doing mental gymnastic because the words spoken have totally different nuances than the subtitle. \n\nNetflix should provide more options because the super-condensed, excessive paraphrasing makes me feel the story lacking depth. It might be more palatable for novice foreign drama viewers, but for seasoned viewers, it\u2019s like watching someone talks for 5 minutes with intricacies but the translation comes out only in one short line and out of original nuances.",

            "comment": "Blasting through my rewatch of **Dream High** (2011) and it's held up surprisingly well since the central story of high school students discovering and pursuing their dreams is such a timeless theme. There are some production choices where I wish they took another approach^(namely live singing and recording instead of studio recording) but for the most part, the cheesy production values add charm to the drama. This was my first Uhm Ki Joon drama and I totally loved his idealistic teacher character...I'm just having a bit of whiplash seeing him so sappy here after seeing him be evil as Joo Dan Tae in **Penthouse**.",

I was going to get an account so I could watch on my computer or on Xfinity, but apparently they are not compatible? Isn't it the same company? wtf?",

My older (18) niece walked in and said \"is this **The King's Affection**?\" And I said \"no, most Joseon dramas start with all the murdering to set up the plot, so I can see how they look similar\". She'd just walked in during the murdering phase. \n\nI had to stop watching in episode 2 because I hated the FL so much. Maybe I've been watching too many dark kdramas, but as soon as the ML was thrown in prison after a mistaken accusation, I couldn't watch anymore. Trigger warning for vomit and injustice!",

The only reason I watched the remake was because of Lee Hyun Woo.  Comments:\n\n* Of course there were corrupt politicians / chaebol as the villains\n* I didn't like the fact that Woojin travelled to meet the Professor.  It would have been much more satisfying if she got on with her life\n* Ugh - Hallstatt is not Kherson!  And then they didn't even film there... completely suspended my disbelief.",

In that aspect I am very much satisfied, especially with Woo Do Hwan, that man never disappoints. What an acting range that guy has. And I can't wait to watch him in Bloodhounds!\n\nAnyway, I cannot see how they will cram the revenge plot in these last episodes.

I have very mixed feelings for this drama.\n\nWhy does it feel like this drama was meant to have 12 episodes but the writer suddenly found out that there will be 16 so they panicked and added everything they could to make it 16.\n\nI really want to say that I love this drama but i must admit that the last 4 episodes were a complete let down. &gt;!And the whole princess going missing for 3 years was so unnecessary and the whole resolution was like \u2018heres a kiss and sexy times, forgive me?\u2019 Broooooo i was ????? the entire time lmao! honestly, they could\u2019ve used the screentime to show the current lives of their clients instead. But hey, that whole revision of law was a nice touch. At least they finished their pops unfinished business!&lt;\n\nBut let me just say, the actor playing exec min yoo was the real mv in this drama. mf had me hating and wishing him pain from ep 1-15, but at episode 16 i was like nooo dont hurt the helpless old lil guy. And that whole meal/dinner scene, i was already bawling at the meaning of yoo ji sun but they had to add it with &gt;!dementia!&lt; i think they humanized him too much :( i ended up feeling sooo bad for him, or maybe i just have a soft spot for old men.\n\nWhatever. I still had fun watching this drama and the entire cast was awesome. I\u2019m going to miss this lovely mess. (To be fair the first half was really really good) \n\nBtw, Kang han soo is the most forgiving mf in joseon. If it was me, wouldve side-eyed the king my entire life for making me read that verdict.",

I think the writer/director just really underestimated what they were doing with the Eun Soo plotline, how much of an impact Eun Soo (and Han So Eun's performance) would make in such a small amount of screen time and just how much the opinion of the King would change based on what he did.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!It's not like I wanted to see Executive Minister Yoo succeed, but I really lost so much respect for the King and what he did that it doesn't really make for a glorious celebration. IF the writer/director thought viewers would go back to the King's side like they wrote Han Soo doing and just be like \"oh well the entire Eun Soo situation is just water under the bridge\" they really miscalculated for me at least.!&lt;",

Then, the ministers willingly exposed what they did in the past with Executive Minister Yoo when no evidence of their involvement was presented yet. Couldn't the two ministers deny all allegations?",

Why did she hide for so long, especially  when she knew he was looking for her, and if she really didn;'t want to be found, why move to the next village???? And WHERE WAS THE DONKEY!?!!&lt;But it's been a great ride, and I've loved reading all the comments, so thank you to everyone who has contributed, you make the experience even better! Now, when's the next one?",

It has so many wonderful ingredients from the beautiful visuals, the AMAZING OST (it's not getting enough praise!), really fun cast of characters, and Do Hwan doing his thing. But some weak writing for sure.\n\nI love dark, angsty historical dramas but I think they shot themselves in the foot by making things so miserable for a while. I really don't think they &gt;!should have killed Eun Soo. Just let her live and exile her.!&lt; This would fix the problem of the &gt;!King's weird character arc and how we're just supposed to go along with him in the end again.!&lt; It feels like they swiftly moved on from &gt;!her tragedy!&lt; in the last two episodes anyway so what was the need?\n\nStill, the last episode did bring me joy and reminded me of what I like about the show, and I'm glad we got &gt;!a happy ending and a better kiss!&lt;, thank goodness for that at least \ud83d\ude05",

It seemed very similar to how Kim Jong-Hyun acted as Kokdu... Maybe not quite as exaggerated.\n\nThe odd thing is that this drama aired in the exact same time-slot as Kokdu after Kokdu finished. Maybe it was some kind of network directive or wish to have a certain 'comedic' element to the lead in the historic setting or something I dunno. It just did not feel like it worked a lot of the time.\n\nYou could say it was an 'act' put on by Han Soo, except for the fact he did it in private as well... It seemed like the degree and level this was done did decrease as the series went along.",

            "comment": "I started **Something in the Rain** (I've already seen **OSN**, which I liked with a few caveats, but had skipped this one in the past). But having read discussions and reviews on this show, I decided not to watch to the end. I finished ep 5 and will probably stop there. I've read recaps of the rest of the episodes and I don't want it to spoil the love I have for the main couple right now. Will just pretend the rest didn't happen! I will say, even in the first few episodes, the music made it almost unbearable and I watched a lot of each episode on mute. I really have no idea why they think anyone needs to hear the same songs nonstop for almost the entirety of each episode. Bizarre choice of song and timing of songs throughout each episode just really drew my attention away. Clearly a stylistic choice because ONS was guilty of this as well, but I at least liked the 2-3 songs in that one more.\n\nI'm also rewatching my favorite, **Just Between Lovers**. This one is not a go-to for me like some of my comfort dramas because of the heavy trauma themes, which means I really need to be in the mood. But I'm coming up on a difficult anniversary myself and the way it handles grief is so beautiful and really resonates with me. Such an exquisite show.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm also caught up on **The Real Has Come** and I just eagerly await each weekend but I wish the discussion threads were a bit more frequent! I need people to talk about it with as it airs omg",

It's a combination of: 1) song choice itself; 2) music cues/timing of songs - like often doesn't match the mood of the scene or a scene would be better without *any* music; 3) repetitiveness of the same songs over and over *and over*. These are like 4 minute songs but somehow a show over an hour long has music playing for over 50% of each episode. It's unbearable! Makes me angry just thinking about it lmao",

I couldn't grasp the under-the-rubble timeline in my initial watch, which is unfortunate because it did make a difference in understanding the magnitude of their connection. \n\nOne of the things I love about this drama is the fact that all of the main and many of the secondary characters have been damaged by the same event and its consequences, yet come away with completely different reactions and ways of thinking about it. And the level of detail the writer went into with showing this is so impressive -- for one small example, Moon Soo doesn't like ice cream after the event, and Gang Doo can't get enough of it. Possibly in reaction to what sent them each to the ice cream shop in the first place?\n\nThe last two episodes annoy me, though -- &gt;!with the liver transplant storyline!&lt; -- I can't decide if I feel like it was filler or an important aspect of the overall story. Also, does Lee Ki Woo ever play a happy character in any of his dramas??",

How awful for him to be in there with a dead person, most of that time, too.  And he was the only one found that day; the last person found alive. \n\nMoon Soo was in there for, I think, 3 days - this is what it says when the architect looks at the list (both for her and Gang Doo). So they would have been in there for those 3 days together, or at least 2 of them. \n\nWhat you mention about different responses - like the ice-cream - is interesting. It's true that people respond differently to traumatic experiences. There are also things that they both retain, like not wanting to be in places without windows.",

But she has been able to change more. Also, she didn't personally remember the experience for so long. Her father saw her sister's probably mangled body, and her mother felt guilty for sending them there in the first place, and she didn't see her daugher's body, so it was hard to accept. \n\nAbout the mother, yes - she's pretty bad in her worst moments. But there's the ongoing unfairness and pain that she causes Moon Soo - such as Moon Soo feeling like she can no longer wear makeup (either partly because that's what she was doing when the collapse started - going to see a boy and trying to look pretty - or because of the connotation with her sister and her mum making her up before she went), and just not letting her really live.",

It's true that people respond differently to traumatic experiences. There are also things that they both retain, like not wanting to be in places without windows.\n\nThe show does a great job of exploring or showing how seemingly mundane things can be impacted by your experiences. Things that other people may not even notice or think about, but someone else who has been through a similar experience may pick up on.\n\nFor example, when the auntie puts lipstick on Moon Soo, and her mom starts freaking out and crying because that is something she associates with Moon Soo's little sister. Then Moon Soo's lack of knowledge of and/or interest in beauty products (skincare, makeup, etc.) suddenly make so much sense. Like how she interacts with her coworker who gave her some moisturizer. Her mom seeing her asleep in a face mask and looking sad about it. When Moon Soo pretends like it's not a big deal to get her nails painted and Gang Doo is there watching her and understanding that part of her already. There are so many little moments like that in the show, and I think that's why I love it so much.",

If only it wasn't so confusing with major plot holes and some of the irrelevant story lines were cut out, I bet it would have been more popular. It felt like it was trying to imitate Christopher Nolan level style of time travel which wasn't working. The alternate timeliness were irrelevant and confusing... but an astounding ending where everything was tied up well. I also loved the main couple, it took me a while to buy it, but I loved how Gon and Tae-Ul's relationship felt mature with no silly arguments or break ups. I also really liked how this drama avoided a lot of popular tropes: memory loss, break up in the middle/ toward the end - it was refreshing in a way. \n\n**Currently watching:** \n\n**Crazy Love** \\- just started watching it, just for Krystal Jung whom I loved in Heirs! I'm hoping it's a drama that I will love.",

Youngsim (8/10):** I know this will be the worst drama I watched in 2023 \ud83d\ude2d the writing is just bad and it\u2019s affecting the acting, chemistry, etc. I feel nothing for the leads which is disappointing. This show should\u2019ve been for me with the 2nd chance romance and childhood connection tropes but nope \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\n\n**My Perfect Stranger (5/16):** I\u2019m not a fan of thriller so I fell off but a part of me wants to finish the drama so I\u2019m starting back up again! I think it\u2019s well written and I love the leads, I just don\u2019t typically watch shows heavily focused on thriller \ud83d\ude2d\n\n**Doctor Cha (9/16):** I\u2019ve laughed so much watching this \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 the husband, his mistress, and the MIL are horrible as expected. I love Doctor Cha and I do like Professor Roy although &gt;!im not surprised he doesn\u2019t end with Doctor Cha.!&lt; I like the son as well but I had to warm up to the daughter. Great watch overall so far :)\n\n**Recently Completed**\n\n**Bo Ra! Deborah:** I was pretty disappointed by the finale week. Everything hit the wall episode 13 and then 14 was just meh. I liked the leads but they didn\u2019t have many couple scenes imo. All the other couples were a no for me. Bomi\u2019s &gt;!surprise pregnancy was such a huge curveball for 1 episode left as well.!&lt; In general, I feel like the other people got way too much screentime the last week and I couldn\u2019t have cared less about any of them. 8/10 because I did like the leads and the plot but I felt robbed at the end. \n\n**Goong:** I loved this one!!! Shin was so damn mean and Chaekyung was so naive buttt when they\u2019re were good with each other I thought they were so cute \ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd70 I did not like the 2nd lead, he was a menace. The ending was slightly disappointing because &gt;!I watched all that drama surrounding the throne for Shin to give it to his sister!&lt; \ud83d\ude2d but I can\u2019t say he made the wrong decision. Both &gt;!him and CK can be free so that was a win!!!!&lt; Overall, I thought it was a good drama! It dragged at points with the scheming and misunderstandings but I enjoyed watching, 9.5/10 \ud83d\udc97",

I couldn't get through Touch Your Heart and thought Bo Ra was fine (not her fault, but the writer's). My favorite role of hers in addition to Goblin is in Snowdrop. She was one of the reasons I kept watching when the writing got really messed up. There's a scene at the end when she parts with Jung Hae In and they have a whole conversation with just their eyes which was masterfully done. She can have such soulful and expressive eyes, but I only saw a bit of that in Bo Ra. She can be really intense in dramatic parts.\n\nWhat I really appreciated in Bo Ra was how she committed to the more cringe-worthy slapstick comedy. That is very difficult to do well and she did a great job.",

The actress FL  in Touch Your Heart and Goblin isn't the same as the FL in  Secretary Kim and Her Private ( unless she is just a member of the cast I missed and not the FL?) The actress in Secretary Kim and Her Private Life is a really  good actress imho  and she isn't cast BO RA.\n\nEdit I didn't read that properly ...I think the actress who plays Bo Ra is pretty plastic imo for a FL and she doesn't have much range so yes it's the same character she always plays imo. That's just my opinion I may be wrong. \n\n   Bo Ra, the show,  is okay but it's not anywhere near as good as so many dramas out there . It's watchable but average imo. Again it's just my opinion. \n\nI see now you don't think they are the same actress \ud83e\udd28 I wondered how that was possible,  sorry \ud83d\ude14",

Park Minyoung was in Whats wrong with secretary Kim and was a sucess. Then, she made almost the same character in Her private life...and then in like 4 or five other kdramas. I watched Forecast love and weather and also seemed close the personas.\n\nI had the fear that Yoo In na was getting the syndrome, with the character of \"pretty and famous, not so smart\", repeating in Goblin, when she was the goblin sister and almost the same character in Touch your heart. I thought that Bo ra would be again the same \"pretty and famous girl, not so smart who need the smart and handsome boy\" premisse.  But yeah...I will give a try to this kdrama.\n\nI'm running away of revenge plots, so I must try any what we have.\n\nEDIT: I like Park Minyoung acting...It's just that became too much repetitive.",

I don't think that life should be based on revenge.\n\nWatching **Romantic Doctor S3**. I love this drama, every season. I'm a huge fan of Euntak (Kim Minjae)...I think there could be a spin off of him.\n\n**Xo, Kitty**. I don't know if it counts as kdrama. It sounded funny. I watched two episodes. Looks okay...not to the best award, but good for resting.\n\nRewatching **The interest of love**. I don't know...it's bizarre how beautiful Moon Gayoung is. Cameras have their effects, but she surpasses the lens on a surreal level. Still, I find the drama weak, the writing bad, and the characters unattractive, so I'm skipping a lot of scenes.\n\nAlso rewatching **Rookie historian**. I like the drama despite some acting. Korea, make more sageuks with a well-constructed background as Rookie historian please!.\n\nOn side note in episode 10 of Romantic doctor there was that accident in a building and a teenage student got a lot of scenes. She looked like Hanni from Newjeans and I thought, \"my god, it would be really smart if out of nowhere Hybe sent the idol to do a cameo in the drama!\".\n\nIt would give experience and connections to the girl and blow up Korea with the news of newjeans Hanni in the drama. in the end, it wasn't her, but it would be one of the best idol entries into the kdrama world of all time.",

No plot just 6 episodes to \"experience.\" While seemingly light, the series is more profound and meaningful than it appears. The acting is SUBLIME. Lee Na Young is a talented actress and is perfect for this role because she has a very natural endearing quality that makes you connect with her character instantly and deeply. Her classic beauty reminds me of Cristy Turlington (and lucky woman is married to my all time favourite OG Oppa, Won Bin.)\n\nI haven't seen anything like ***One Day Off*** in K Drama world. Reminds me a bit of Sofia Copolla's earlier works and some Japanese melo shows.\n\nIt's so special and I wish it got the attention and praise that it rightfully deserves.

Sitting through subtitles that werent timed right was a STRUGGLE and ruined my experience a bit, but overall it was an enjoyable watch and an interesting look into the work of a guard center. A typical work-focused jdrama.\n\n**Adult Trainee (2021)**  \nI (and probably most people) wanted to watch this because of the clips I had seen of the 2nd couple. As expected, I did enjoy the 2nd couples story. But I was positively surprised by the 1st couple and I cant decide which one I liked better between the two. 3rd \"couple\" storyline was a mess and very disappointing. Not sure why they had her be &gt;!friendzoned!&lt; when they were also trying to be body positive. I also couldnt take the \"ML\" seriously because I cant unsee him as the goofy little brother from *True Beauty*, lol.\n\n**Rookie Cops (2022)**  \nBeen sitting in my on-hold list ever since I read spoilers for the ending. But it was disappointing long before that point. I was expecting a very lighthearted comedy and it was immediately *not* that. The ML was very underwhelming. Dont think it was Daniel's fault tbh, he just very blandly written in comparison to the other characters. And dont get me started on the dumb &gt;!death!&lt; in the end. Completely useless. I'm just glad i'm done with it.\n\n**Extraordinary Attorney Woo (2022)**  \nI FINALLY watched it. Tbh, I was lowkey following it while it was airing but stopped because I wanted to watch it with my mother. She ended up hating it after 1 episode (too much law stuff + too fast subtitles because Woo speaks so fast). Which kinda ruined my mood to watch it. But I was in the mood to give it another try. It is absolutely worth the praise, although maybe a little bit overrated. Some cases were very interesting, while some were a snooze fest that had me pressing the fast forward button. Loved the characters and the romance was insanely adorable. I look forward to s2.\n\n**Good Doctor (2018)**  \nI have clearly been on a mission to clean up my on-hold list, and decided to finally get through this one. The original kdrama version has a special place in my heart, and this japanese remake did not live up to it at all imo. I love Yamazaki Kento, but he couldnt save this one. It was heavily focused on the parient stories, and with only 10 short episodes there really wasnt any time for anything else. There was far too little focus on the ML. He just...became a doctor and that was it really. Not really any further struggles with his autism after that point, nor did they really dive into his family life. The romance storyline was completely cut out. Some seem to like that, but I think the romantic relationship was a *very* important and beautiful plot in the kdrama to show the ML's emotions. Overall, if you enjoy medical dramas and want heartwrenching patient stories, you'll enjoy it. If you wanted a similar remake, maybe not so much.",

I didn\u2019t have any spoilers going in, so I thought &gt;!he just wasn\u2019t going to have a love interest at all, and then I thought he was just going to have a hopeless crush for the whole series, and I was really happy it didn\u2019t turn out that way. It showed people accepting him as a man and not just as a doctor.!&lt; Of course not every series needs romance and not every character needs a love interest but it was an important part of the show for me.",

I wasn't hooked or anything, but it was interesting seeing her back then. Also, Yoo Yeon Seok! He was the 2ML here. &gt;!Honestly don't think I've seen him in a drama where he wins the girl, including this one.!&lt; All in all, simple story, and it felt like a long movie. \n* **Drama Special Season 3: When I was the Prettiest (1/1)** \u2014 I watched this one for the challenge because Lee Jong Suk is in it, aaaaand I hated it. I get the point of the story, but cheating is never okay. The only time I found a cheating plot line semi-digestable was My Mister, and that's because it was handled in a complex way while also villainizing it. Now, to be fair, this was 1 hour. And My Mister is a masterpiece. Not a fair comparison. Still. Hated this.\n\nCurrently Watching:\n* **The Good Bad Mother (12/14)** \u2014 I can believe that we have 2 episodes left. This drama is wonderful. It's not without its flaws, but so far, I recommend it very much. I feel heartbreak coming, and I'm so not ready. There will be tears, as usual. I know it.\n* **Itaewon Class (10/16)** \u2014 Not really into this drama, but there are great aspects to it. I can see why it was popular. Second PSJ drama, let's go! I dislike the FL so much, but the ML, he's so easy to root for. Park Sae Ro Yi, fighting!\n* **A Business Proposal (7/12)** \u2014 How does one not squeal when watching this drama? So cute!!! Episodes 6 and 7 were so great. The main couple are becoming more and more adorable. The second couple are getting more swoon-worthy, and I ... just ... aaaah! My brain melted. The ML is so lovable now, too. I can't. I just want to watch. \n\nAlso watched an episode of **Memorist**, episode 13. I remember really liking this drama at first, but I don't like plots where twists just feel aimless? Idk. I felt this way at first about 365 Repeat the Year, but it made so much sense at the end. Maybe I'm wrong about this one, but I'm just not feeling it. Also watched episode 9 of **Sungkyunkwan Scandal**, and why are the males in this drama so good ... except for the ML? Bland and uninteresting. Also, when Song Joong Ki and Yoo Ah In are the other male leads, I can't take my eyes off them. ML, step aside.",

OR ELSE!!\n\n**My Perfect Stranger** (12/16) - started this over the weekend and binged to catch up. I do really like this show - the story, characters, acting are all on point - but I feel that there are some glaring flaws in storytelling and directing that are holding this show back. for example, the set and lightening makes the town feel so artificial. sometimes I like the stage play vibe but other times I hate it.  the mystery is nice and engaging, but the detective work is... whew don't quit your day jobs, guys. the cops are lacking even judging on the very very low kdrama cop scale. yikes.\n\n**Delightfully Deceitful** (2/16) - this one feels like a watch the weekly episodes in a 2 hour block type of show. watching each episode on the day it airs may be too stressful. I'm enthralled that the ML is a Highly Sensitive Person. it's so typically kdrama to pull an obscure neuro disorder out of a hat and make it the ML's unique selling point. Kim Dong Wook is usually very good about taking his roles to deep psychological places, so I'm hopeful we get something very interesting in this portrayal.\n\nActually KDW has one of the best tastes in scenarios and character choices. (watch King of Pigs!) I almost always love his projects. (watch King of Pigs!) they don't always end in a resounding success but that usually doesn't lay at his feet. (the preceding sentence does not apply to King of Pigs. watch it.)",

It's entertaining, but I'm not holding my breath waiting for it every week. It's nice that it's completely separate from the 1st season and they give you all the background you need.\n\n**The Real Has Come** (22/50) - I committed to this when it started without knowing it would be 50 episodes, but the first 8-10 episodes were so much fun I couldn't stop. Then they slowed down and I considered dropping it multiple times, but they keep putting in really interesting twists...so here I am still waiting for Saturday at 11pm when Viki finally uploads it. My only 50-ep frame of reference is Empress Ki where Beak Jin Hee (FL in TRHC) is the evil Empress Danashiri. That was like drinking drama from a fire-hose in most episodes and the story covers more than 10 years of history. So, this is definitely a new experience. Hope the writers keep up the good work....when is Jinjja coming?!?!\n\n**Doctor Romantic 3** (12/16) - I have to admit this is more of the same in the Dr. Romantic universe and they are kind of butchering some of my favorite characters (Cha Eun Jae, fighting!). However, as someone who has worked in large medical centers my entire career, I am loving the nuances in talking about leadership, issues with medical administration styles, and generational communication gaps that are taking more center stage this season. Those are so well written! And I can't wait for the Seas 1-Seas 2 crossover this week.\n\nI have not found anything really exciting in a while, so I decided to go for Challenge #24 in the KDC - A drama I've always wanted to watch but have not. Enters **Signal** (6/16) - OMG!! It's so well done! Hope they stick the landing because right now I have no idea how things are going to go.

But I will wait until the end, I may have changed my mind. I am totally smitten with Vin Zhang. What a gorgeous man, his gaze! One frustrating aspect of this drama is the English translations. While I appreciate all the effort and hard work of volunteer translators I found so much nuance in speech and syntax was lost, lacked clarity at times, too simplistic. I found it hard to work out what was happening at times.  It often read like Google auto translate. Maybe this was compounded by the actual script as well.",

Quality is also high: **The Count of Monte Cristo** might seem nothing more than a riedition of the book but it's such a good revenge drama, with a diabolical ML, truly A+ acting, that plans his vengeance to the smallest detail and has no regrets. Pacing gets better late on, most characters are loathable, scheme is grand and well executed, a deserved 8.\n\nIn progress\n\n\\- **My Perfect Stranger (12/16):** so close getting to know the culprit's identity, a lot of theories and a bit too fillerish, not really into the leads' romance but the mystery is solid and acting ain't bad either;\n\n\\- **Delightfully Deceitful (3/16):** a bit weird with such a ML and all 4th wall breaking stuff, but the FL is unique and fun in her own way. Still don't know where the story is going, SML is the bad guy as always, so wait and see what comes;\n\n\\- **Public Affairs Office in the Sky (6/11):** another J-Dorama, an interesting slow burn romance with a curious setting as in the Armed Defense Forces, a story about people failing in their dreams and starting anew. Nice leads, easy to follow, amazing OSTs.\n\nCould pick up **The Villain of Romance** if it's any decent, waiting for **Heartbeat** later in June.",

            "comment": "Finally started **Taxi Driver 2** 8/16 and thankfully I am enjoying it. Definitely has a lighter, more comedic vibe this season. I'm so happy the engineers and hacker have more scenes this season. I feel slightly less invested overall and don't care for the current big bad storyline but will see it through and hope for the best.\n\n\nI'm two episodes into **Queen of Masks** after browsing the on-air episode threads and seeing people mostly like it. It's giving me **Scandal** vibes, in that I immediately distrust literally every character and have no idea what's happening.",

            "comment": "**The Good Bad Mother** (12/14) There is nothing that I like better than some good genre mixing where every genre is done well. \n\nWith this show, we have a well-crafted thriller that casts doubts on the ML's personality, a quirky comedy with unique characters that are the villagers, a sad drama that will require tissues, an adorable romance that will melt your heart and the impersonation of wholesomeness that are the twins. \n\nI don't think that this drama is perfect. At times, some aspects get so exaggerated that the show seems to work against it's own message, but, in my opinion, it is still a well-crafted, well-acted and well-directed drama that is definitely worth a watch. I will miss it. \n\n**Duty After School** (1/10) I know that this sub was collectively disappointed with the ending, but I still want to give this show a try. So far, it has been entertaining. \n\nIt is probably because I watched **All Quiet on the Western Front** recently, but I can't shake away the feeling that something atrocious is going to happen to all of these characters and few (possibly none) will make it out alive.",

Will definitely have my hands full in the next few days with **See You In My 19th Life** and **King The Land** airing on the same days.",

            "comment": "**New:**\n\n*Doom At Your Service/The Day Doom Knocked At My Door* (that's the literal title I'm giving it... I'd also go with 'Destruction' there, instead of 'Doom'... but his title/role is hard to define in a word that works the right way in English). I've already watched 4 episodes, and really, really like it. I know some people weren't happy with it, but I've read some things that help, and it might be another one (like so many) that I just have a quite different opinion about. It's very popular on Viki, though. I remember when it came out, and I was watching other things (like *Bossam: Steal The Fate*), and it seemed intriguing, but also not really the thing I wanted. This seems to be affected by what I'm watching around the same time. At the moment, I guess I'm in the mood to appreciate and need something like this. The dialogue is so tight, and the themes and underlying meanings wonderful. Like everyone else, I love the hand-holding and the conflict of that and their attitudes. Also the ironic angst of their respective and linked situations. So sad and sweet. I really like Seo In Gook's role, and the way he acts it. Very captivating. \n\n**Ongoing:**\n\n*Perfect Stranger* \\- such a good show. Almost everything is done well, and it's captivating. I think the relationship between the main characters is sweet and natural from the beginning - it develops logically and sweetly. The themes of family, past and future, choices, compassion, context, justice, struggle, and so on, are skillfully and carefully woven in. It has a strange 50s-style vibe, more than an 80s one (maybe that's what South Korea was like in the late 80s? If so, very different from here). But I'm accepting the bits that are deliberately not explained, like the car and the stage-play setting of the town centre and street where they live. I think these work well with the style/mood of the show, and are actually deliberate, to increase that feeling.\n\n*Shopping King/Shopaholic Louis* \\- not enjoying the frustratingly slappy humour, but Louis is still an adorable character, wonderfully acted by Seo Min Gook \ud83d\udc4f \ud83e\udee0. I'm in the hard parts now, but I'm sure things will work out soon. I hate when people give our heroes or heroines bad advice, and they trust them and follow it.\n\n*Just Between Lovers* \\- this is a lovely show that really draws you in. So much pain - experiences and learnt beliefs that tie people down, and then those who want to overcome them. K-drama does this overcoming part so well, linking it to relationships where people pull each other out, bit by bit, with the force of their love - determination and compassion. I love this about K-dramas.\n\n*Great Doctor* \\- almost finished! Final episode to go. I hope it ends well \ud83d\ude14\ud83e\udd72",

            "comment": "I am watching a variety of shows from  Asia.\nKDrama\nDr Romantic 3. Loving it. Exciting, heartwarming and interesting. \nFinished All that we Loved. Enjoyed it overall but disappointed in last episode. The drama had so much potential however as it was a short series and  I think it lost the chance to provide more depth to the story and characters. I admit I got the reveal wrong way around at the end. \n\nCDrama\nBack from the Brink. A nice piece of Xianxia fluff with loving lead couple.\nWe Meet Again. I am smitten with Vin Zhang or Bibbin. Say no more.\n\nJDrama\nEven If You Don\u2019t Do It. JDramas are just different in so many ways. This one is maintaining my interest mainly because of the good acting.",

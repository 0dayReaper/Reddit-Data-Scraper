One of my most hated tropes is a character who is so devoted to family that they could tolerate anying, even them being a murder. So you can just imagine my shock and relief that it isn't the case. I can honestly only sincerely apologise to Hee-sub because he is just a genuine guy with a kind and innocent nature that is unwavering. My feelings completely reversed because I can't bear to see people go through such underserved torment. Hope they somehow find peace but the teaser left me speechless!&lt;\n\nEP10: What a heartwarming episode. Mother's are so strong man. &gt;!What Hae-kyung's mother did for all those years broke my heart but goes to show just how strong that pillar in everyone's life can be. And  really enjoyed the change of pace with Yoon-young finding some peace and seeing how beautiful her parents were together.

At the picnic, for example, Hae Joon rushed back when he heard that Yoon Yong was on her own, or had stopped, or just wasn't there yet - he was so worried about her meeting some difficulty, with the murderer at large. Then, he helped her up and brushed her back off. And Mi Sook saw that he was so worried and went back for her, and noted it. She also notes whenever he helps Yoon Yong and they're together - like this week, when he came in to help with the fight in the classroom.\n\nHe also made sure he saved Yoon Yong from Mi Sook's brother - even throwing a pot plant through the door window to get in, and beating him up. He's also been very kind to her, for the most part - making sure she gets to spend time with her mother, saving her father and uncle, making lunch and breakfast for her and telling her she doesn't need to wash up; taking her to the caf\u00e9 because she hadn't eaten anything and getting her something sweet and salty to eat, because he remembered that's what she liked - even though he hates it....\n\nThere've been hints \ud83d\ude42.",

But he goes above it for her, and they've shown him being particularly responsive to her needs and so on - not in a really obvious way. She hasn't picked it up, for example. As he says when she falls asleep there, she's totally oblivious. Like when she tried to 'reassure' him that she would probably disappear in the future, because she thought her father was the killer (meaning also his killer), and he said, 'Do you really think I would be happy about that/ that would reassure me?', or something like that. That was a hint \ud83d\ude0e. \n\nIn real life, though, hints are hard to find, esp when they involve you. We're much better at picking them up about others.",

We don't know why she was upset in that flashback, or who she was talking about. I'm sure she felt pain for Hee Seop, and maybe he was later unable to express some things. Maybe he kept thinking he was a bad person in some way, and that's why things had happened that way. \n\nTrauma has deep and complex effects, and they're not easy to deal with. Do you deal with all of your problems effectively and quickly? Do you always do what you should in regard to them? Or is it a lot easier to look in from outside and afterwards, and say that? Do you think that as a parent you would always make the right choice, or that you would tell your child about the harrowing experiences you had when you were younger? Or would you choose to let them live freely, without those worries? It seems Yoon Yong's parents chose the latter.",

I suspect she knew the choice she was making when she married him, and she knew the choice she was making when she continued to stay with him.

Village gossip would have spread. Whether he ever told her himself is up in the air.\n\nEdit: Just finished ep 10 and looks like Soon Ae did resent Hee Seop to a degree.

(This is a comment that I made on another comment further down). Here are some of the things I've picked up as we've watched:\n\nAt the picnic, Hae Joon rushed back when he heard that Yoon Yong was on her own, or had stopped, or just wasn't there yet - he was so worried about her meeting some difficulty, with the murderer at large. Then, he helped her up and brushed the dirt/leaves off her back. And Mi Sook saw that he was so worried and went back for her, and noted it. She also notes whenever he helps Yoon Yong and they're together - like this week, when he came in to help with the fight in the classroom.\n\nHe also made sure he saved Yoon Yong from Mi Sook's brother - even throwing a pot plant through the door window to get in, and beating him up.\n\nHe's also been very kind to her, for the most part - like making sure she gets to spend time with her mother, saving her father and uncle, making lunch and breakfast for her and telling her she doesn't need to wash up; taking her to the caf\u00e9 because she hadn't eaten anything and getting her something sweet and salty to eat, because he remembered that's what she liked - even though he hates it. The caf\u00e9 owner has noticed them, both times they were there that we see her seeing them, and thought they were a loving couple. They told her they weren't, but she watched them walk off in the rain, and smiled to herself - she didn't buy what they said. She sees it. \n\nThere've been hints \ud83d\ude42.",

He will not know the day of the hanging until the executioner knocks on his cell door at noon that day.*\n\n*Having reflected on his sentence, the prisoner draws the conclusion that he will escape from the hanging. His reasoning is in several parts. He begins by concluding that the \"surprise hanging\" can't be on Friday, as if he hasn't been hanged by Thursday, there is only one day left \u2013 and so it won't be a surprise if he's hanged on Friday. Since the judge's sentence stipulated that the hanging would be a surprise to him, he concludes it cannot occur on Friday. He then reasons that the surprise hanging cannot be on Thursday either, because Friday has already been eliminated and if he hasn't been hanged by Wednesday noon, the hanging must occur on Thursday, making a Thursday hanging not a surprise either. By similar reasoning, he concludes that the hanging can also not occur on Wednesday, Tuesday or Monday. Joyfully he retires to his cell confident that the hanging will not occur at all.The next week, the executioner knocks on the prisoner's door at noon on Wednesday \u2013 which, despite all the above, was an utter surprise to him. Everything the judge said came true.\"*",

She's too prominent of a character not to serve some purpose. They made a point to introduce her, and she keeps popping up. She has to be relevant to the story somehow, so my guesses are that she's either Hae Joon's mom, or is somehow related to the murders.!&lt;",

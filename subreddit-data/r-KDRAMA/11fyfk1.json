            "comment": "Yeon Sang-ho has become a filmmaking juggernaut for Netflix. In addition to his Netflix original film, **Jung\\_E**, which was released in January, and **Hellbound Season 2**, he has two other Netflix original series' in production. The first of these is **The Bequeathed**, which reunites Kim Hyun-joo and Park Hee-soon, the leads from **Trolley**. The second is **Parasyte: The Grey**, starring Jeon So-nee and Koo Kyo-hwan.\n\nI think that his projects are ambitious, but his reach tends to exceed his grasp. In particular, I think he's a talented visual stylist, but his storytelling isn't quite up to the same standard (at least since his magnum opus, **Train to Busan**.)",

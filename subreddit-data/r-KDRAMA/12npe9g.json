Had a lot of fun. PHJ was phenomenal as the lead. \n\nBad things: Too short. Lol. &gt;!Choi Hyun-Wook and Lee Yeon probably won\u2019t be back for S2, if there is an S2!&lt;\n\nInteresting things: Seeing Shin Seung Ho as a high schooler so close to seeing him as the prince in Alchemy of Souls was pretty interesting. \n\nSpotlight: This series didn\u2019t get nearly as much attention as it should have. It\u2019s the kind of thing that if it had streamed on Netflix, like The Glory, I think it would have gotten much more appreciation. It also got largely snubbed by the Baeksang awards - shame. It\u2019s such a great series. Worth watching!",

The series and the cast and crew deserved so much better for such an amazing storyline and production and the way they were snubbed, just because they were not from a huge production company is just outrageous! Especially when that drama had everything and was good in all aspects, literally. (acting, story, plot, production, soundtrack, direction, you name it!)",

            "comment": "I think the best high-school-set drama I've watched is *Extra-ordinary You*. I'm not sure if I've recommended it before for one of these Spotlight discussions.\n\n**Why I love it**:\n\n* It's unique - the concept, of being part of a 'manwha'/comic series, with all the frustration, suspense and danger, and the laughs, that come with that, is fun and works really well, mostly. The other unique and funny part, which also leads to a lot of the angst and beauty, is that the main character for us is not a main character in the manwha.\n* It's funny - as described above, and lots of other funny things. For example, the main characters in the manwha are made to be stock-standard romantic-story figures, in a high school, with the 'F4' or whatever they're called, the hero and heroine and the tragic boy who also likes her but doesn't get his wish, and all the funny and silly things that happen with that.\n* The characters - our heroine (not the manwha heroine, who isn't a major character in the drama) is plucky and honest. She struggles to act as herself, not as her written character, and while this is frustrating - for her and us - it also gets us behind her, making us want her to succeed. She also loves a pretty awesome guy... bringing us to the hero (again, ours, not the manwha's), who is extremely handsome, and very heroic. He's a sort of tragic hero, because he's a minor character who only sometimes appears in the manwha, and the author keeps trying to get rid of him. This creates a lot of the struggle - and some humour - in the story. There's a gratifyingly tragic and romantic backstory for these two as well. Then we have the lovely 3rd part of the love triangle involving the manwha heroine and hero. The hero is pretty ordinarily nice and all, but the other guy who likes the heroine is so nice, genuine, funny, and so on. The actor is the nice scholar who likes the heroine (again) in *Guesthouse* \\- so I really hope he's successful this time! He's also very nice to look at.\n* The concept of not accepting your 'scripted destiny' and being who you want to be. The main characters in our story are minor characters and extras in the manwha. But to themselves, they are the main characters. They are the heroes and heroines of their own stories, and the most enjoyable thing about this series is watching them fight for that. (Although it also brings in the angst and so on). The way that various characters gradually 'wake up' from their written roles and become 'real' is exciting and gratifying. You're guessing who's going to figure it out next, or who already has.\n* The really nice visual loveliness - the boys (especially Rowoon/his character) and the school setting.\n\n**Less-great things**:\n\n* The struggle of the heroine and the guy she's written to be with goes on too long, I think. It got really frustrating for me. This guy is also a very unpleasant character, but is shown to have a terrible family life, which is supposed to make you feel sorry for him. You do, but he treats her so badly, and is constantly there, acting like he owns her, when it's clear she doesn't love him. He won't take her feelings into account.\n* I found the white/blonde-haired kitchen assistant an annoying character, but he's central to things.\n* I didn't like how it was implied that the writer of the story is like God, because the author is heartless and manipulative, but this was able to be ignored for the most part.\n* I wish Rowoon's character was in it more and the annoying written-boyfriend wasn't there so much instead.\n* The ending is hopeful and somewhat satisfying, but also difficult. I was mostly okay with this, because it was realistic for the concept, and life is not perfect. We have to keep struggling with it. I liked that &gt;!they got to experience another setting, though. The high school was just too difficult. !&lt;\n* I found the heroine (Dan-Oh) annoying, as well as plucky and so on. I don't know how much of this was the actress, and how much was her character, but it included the way she spoke and acted.\n\n**Interesting things**:\n\n* All the main guys are very tall - Rowoon the tallest, I think.\n* I've forgotten her name, but the actress who played the heroine is quite short, so next to Rowoon and the other very tall guy who is her manwha boyfriend, it was quite a contrast.\n* The heroine's manwha boyfriend is/was the hero in *Alchemy of Souls*; the manwha hero was the lead actor in *Shooting Stars*; and the lovely 3rd part of the manwha love triangle is the nice scholar in *Guesthouse*.\n* This is where I learnt how to say, \"let's go\" in Korean. Haru keeps turning up, taking her hand/wrist, and saying, \"Ka-za\" \ud83d\ude04, and they leave her annoying 'boyfriend' or whoever behind. \n\n**Spotlight on because**:\n\nWhile it's a high-school-set series, it only partly feels like it. I think this is because of the fantasy concept, and that it's only partly about high school. The concepts go much deeper. I got a quite profound message from it - that it doesn't matter how others have 'written' your story, or how important you are to theirs or to the story of the world at large. It matters how you see your own role, and how determined you are to play it well. None of us are side characters, however much it might seem; we are the heroes and heroines - the 'extra-ordinary', not the 'extras' or 'ordinary' characters in someone else's story. You don't want to take this too far, because everyone's story matters; but I felt inspired by it while/after watching. It was a high school series I could watch without feeling annoyed or bored or just too old to enjoy it.",

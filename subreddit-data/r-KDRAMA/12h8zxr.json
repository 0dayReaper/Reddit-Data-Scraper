One of her all-time favorite kdramas is **The Bride of Habeak** (hey! save it! she's a teenager and everybody loves their problematic first kdrama! jk I make fun of her all the time even though I kinda liked BoH), and I knew that LBS would beat that hands-down. I managed to hook her, so my job was done!\n\nThen I binged **Weak Hero Class 1** and oh man, I thought school bullying and revenge dramas had become too trendy but WHC1 was amazing. I don't have to pile on the accolades for the acting, but for such a simple story/plot, without the actors fully fleshing out these characters, it would never have worked. You had to see the evolution of the characters and feel the agony of so many misunderstandings and the young characters' sheer inability to communicate. It's a tough watch, emotionally, but so worth it.\n\nI saw that the only Baeksang nod was for Hong Kyung as Best New Actor? While he absolutely deserves a nod, it really feels like Park Ji-hoon deserved an acting nod in a main category, as well. He was amazing, as was Choi Hyun-Wook. Just incredible and subtle.\n\nPlus Crown Prince! I missed Shin Seung-ho after **Alechemy of Souls** wrapped so it was nice to see him and his ponytail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit to Add that I've been bingeing so much lately I totally forgot that Jihoon was one of my favorite characters in **Flower Crew: Joseon Marriage Agency**! He plays Yeong Soo, who has hands-down one of the most tragic back stories I've ever seen, and yet somehow manages to become a beautiful, bright cupcake of a human being. Now I want even more Jihoon, and at such a young age, he will hopefully be around for years.",

Like a lot of Joseon-era stuff, it makes you fall in love with the characters and then hits you in the face with tragic back stories that leave you a weeping mess.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it and there were parts I loved, but the FL was hard to take and you have to convince yourself somebody has a happy ending because most everyone does not! \n\nSo worth watching for the performances and the color and humor, but it is emotionally draining.\n\nEdit to say I needed a break from heavy drama so i started **The Ultimate Oppa** on Amazon Prime and it's cute and funny rom com so far! Lots of familiar faces, too!",

Overall, I would say it was a good drama, but not nearly as good as I thought it was going to be. IMO I think it would have been better as a 10/12 episode drama (maybe even 16 at a push) as I felt it dragged a lot and could have had more impact if they didn't have as many filler episodes. However, there was some great acting from the cast, but as expected with the actors and actresses they had in the drama. I did enjoy the final episodes as they did tie up the loose ends, and the background stories were wrapped up nicely. Also, I'm glad there was a happy ending for the main characters, which was well deserved. So overall, for me it was a good drama but could have been shorter.",

Therefore across the country, there are various water systems for accessing groundwater/storage/irrigation uses etc when the monsoon fails or falls short. Stepwell is one of them.",

I shall definitely try &amp; finish TCC before my bday, i.e., 12th April so that I can pick a good drama &amp; try to get out of my slump. Personally, didn\u2019t enjoy TCC as much as people hyped it for me. It was an ok watch so far. But I most certainly did enjoy YJG\u2019s acting! It was his best from whatever I\u2019ve seen him in. \n\nLTHY is a nice romcom, I\u2019m enjoying it. Hopefully it catches my attention soon tho. \n\nOn another note, a post on Twitter made me watch this documentary on Netflix - House of Secrets: The Burari Deaths, not the best of the documentary but oh my God, it really dis traumatize me &amp; creep the shit out of me. Anyone interested in watching a real life mass accidental death documentary then please do check it out. \n\nI\u2019m also watching **Murder Mystery 2** and it\u2019s been a fun watch!",

We also have a few parent child pairings (ex: Ha Jung Woo who is Kim Yong Gun's son, I know Go Du Shim has a son who is also an actor) and a few sibling pairings (ex: Ryu Hye Young and Ryu Abel, Kim Tae Hoon and Kim Tae Woo, Choi Min Sik and Choi Kwang Pil) and of course a lot more actors marry each other but I don't think I've ever heard of a full fledged acting family where you have multiple generations of a family, not just parents and children but extended family members in the business (think the Barrymores, the Sheens, the Redgraves). What gives? We have a lot of them in the Philippines where I'm from. Bollywood has a lot of them too. I know Korea's a highly competitive society where only the best survive but I'm not sure they're not above turning acting into a family business too.",

That is some level of detail. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s always nice to see bits of your hobby in a drama, right?

But what's more amazing in this drama are the intro and outro animations that were done by Jamsan, a well-known Korean artist. He also did the artworks for the children's books in \"It's Okay to Not Be Okay.\" \n\n\"Encounter\" is worth watching if only because of the exquisitely gorgeous intro and outro animations. [Here's a screenshot from the Ep. 3 animation by Jamsan.](https://imgur.com/Zdrs4wV)\n\nI first saw Song Hye-kyo in her 2007 film \"Hwang Jin Yi\" (based on Korea's most famous gisaeng). She looks absolutely stunning in this movie; trailer at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N8ksm6s7Sno\n\nThe YT video at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QKKf9-_m8zc features different closeups of Song Hye-kyo in her costumes, wigs, and head gears for \"Hwang Jin Yi.\" (In the childhood scenes, Hwang Jin Yi was played by Kim Yoo-jung, who was probably 6 or 7 years old at the time.)\n\nThe last scenes in \"Hwang Jin Yi\" are set in Mount Kumgang (Geumgangsan) aka Diamond Mountain; during the Joseon Dynasty, Geumgangsan was a pilgrimage site for artists, scholars, royalty, and nobles. There was a time when tourists from South Korea were allowed by the North Korean government to visit this mountain range.\n\nIn the 2017 drama \"Saimdang\" starring Lee Young-ae, Geumgangsan played a big part in the FL's life. The FL is based on Shin Saimdang, the most famous woman in Korean history, who was an artist, poet, and mother of exemplary children; she's featured on the 50,000 won note.

I did find the Kim Hong-Do painting and ended up doing a search for just his name but of course it still didn't pop up :) I do like that they made such a nice image just for the series. \nAnd thank you for introducing me to that blog! I also love that symbolism for both the cat and the butterfly. Maybe that's why the cat's like 'meh, I'll chase it some other time', haha!",

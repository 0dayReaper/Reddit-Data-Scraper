It was all so smart and made sense why each character responded positively (by caring and standing up for others) or negatively (by bullying because the 3rd ML was traumatized and needed to feel bigger by bullying others). \n\nI felt like the rawness and smartness of park jihoon\u2019s acting made me root for him even more because he was to numb to care in the beginning but used his nerdiness to make bullies back off and had such a calm scariness and dead eyes.

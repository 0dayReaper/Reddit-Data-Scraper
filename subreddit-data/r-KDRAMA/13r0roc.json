    "postText": "Grab yourself a knee rug and a mug of hot chocolate, it's time to reminisce those old time dramas from days gone by of pre-2019. Maybe you were  around when they aired for the first time and want to take a trip down  memory lane by watching them on the box. Maybe it's your first time  through.\n\nThis is our weekly discussion exclusively for those older Korean dramas on your currently watching list. We don't want to hear about the currently hyped dramas here, so please keep it to the older stuff on your watch list.\n\nReminder, **we advocate the use of legal streaming sources wherever possible**. Any comments mentioning illegal sources will be removed and links will lead to bans as per [our rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_linking_to_illegal_sources).  As it is very hard to find many of the really old dramas rather than  asking users \"where are you watching?\", we suggest you instead ask \"did  you find a legal source?\". See [our policies on streaming sites and VPNs here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/streaming_sites#wiki_vpns).\n\nCrazily enough not everyone has watched these classics yet so **please remember your spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;. For more detailed guidance on spoiler tags and when to use them, check our [Spoiler Tags Tutorial](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags).\n\n\n***Just In Case Resources***\n\n[FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and [Netflix FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101/netflix_faqs) **|** [Glossary](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions) **|** [Latest On-Airs](/r/KDRAMA/search?q=flair%3Aon-air&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=week) and [On-Air Roster](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episode_discussion_roster) **|** [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) **|** [Where To Watch *aka* Legal Sites](/r/kdrama/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas) **|** [Everything In Our Wiki *aka* Wiki Homepage](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/index) **|** [Get Recommendations For Your Next Watch](/r/kdramarecommends/comments/hl34w7/rules_resources_and_a_guide_to_navigating/)",

            "comment": "I was waiting for this weekly post to gush about **Dali and the Cocky Prince**.  What a wonderful romcom.  It was nearly perfect.\n\nThe leads were so good, quirky and fun, and had great chemistry together.  The story was interesting and held my attention throughout.\n\nBut what I loved about this Romcom is how the show subverted the usual tropes, especially at the end where they took the gloves off and outright played with the audience.\n\nThe best part and one of the reasons I loved this drama so much is that our OTP knew they loved each other and never wavered from that.  It took a while to get there, otherwise, it wouldn't be a K-drama, but once they arrived at their destination, there was no wavering.   Once our hero discovers he loves our heroine, there is no turning back.  And it's the same for her.  Their love is as straight and true as an arrow.  My favourite part at the very end is when she tells his father.  &gt;!Don't take him away from me, and don't take me away from him.  Acknowledging that they both love each other and that separating them would be hurtful despite his objections!  If this was a trope, I would call it the anti-noble idiocy trope.!&lt; \n\nIf you want to watch a sweet, funny opposite-attracts Romcom with charming leads that you fall in love with, this is the drama for you.\n\nETA Another quality of their romance was how organic and natural it felt.  You could feel not only that they were attracted, but why, through all their interactions.  In some dramas, you are told rather than shown they are attracted to each other.  In this one, you could see that she loved his offbeat humour and the way he lived in the real world.  And for him, he was attracted to her intelligence, her knowledge and her strength of will.  They got each other.",

Wacky office hijinks plus second chance/time travel storyline, and the leads\u2019 original chaotic home life was so depressingly possible. I liked how following the timeline change ML realized his selfishness early on despite the giddiness he might have felt about the outcome. I feel he spent most of the series trying to make up for that. \n\nThere were just a couple very minor things I questioned regarding timeline change after episode 13 but not enough to bother me. Really liked how the show emphasizes how we treat each other can have such a profound impact on our lives and future. The office stuff was also very real to me (highlighted small things like having a self-centered boss in a real but funny way)",

It has a good soundtrack, Ji Sung and Han Ji-min have really good chemistry, the supporting cast is great, particularly Lee Jung-eun as the mom, and the writer, Yang Hee-seung, also made Oh My Ghost, Weightlifting Fairy, and Crash Course in Romance which I think are worth checking out. One disappointment for me was that Kang Han-na's character's negative attributes were played up too much in the first half and made her more sympathetic turn in the second half less effective.\n\nGo Back Couple had almost the same premise and is also very good.",

It's great to have two dramas that basically have the same premise, yet both are different enough in tone and details that they can stand apart and both be worthwhile.",

Hogu is an adorable socially awkward goober with a heart of gold who gets into an unlikely relationship with a superstar medal winning swimmer who is completely out of his league. It touches on topics like &gt;!abortion, single parenthood, adoption, assault!&lt;, and others not often talked about. The FL is just fantastically written--tough, prickly, competitive and driven but also deeply lonely and vulnerable in many ways.\n\nThe drama is laugh out loud funny at times and sometimes there's toilet/slapstick humor which isn't my fave but there's also little illustrated cut scenes and fantasy sequences and I can't predict where the story is going which is great. Every episode has surprised me.\n\nThis drama apparently wasn't legally available until very recently which is why it's not well known but I hope people check it out because it's turning out to be a gem. You can watch it on Prime and on Tubi for free [https://tubitv.com/series/300009799/hogus-love](https://tubitv.com/series/300009799/hogus-love).",

I love how they subvert the Mary Poppins trope--with her bag full of interesting stuff and unusual skills. Yet she's the opposite of Mary Poppins. Yes, many of the characters are annoying, but the premise is intriguing and I like the focus on the family. I won't post the challenges this fits, other than challenge 35. The drama is over 10 years old.\n\nI binged the short **Seven First Kisses** over the weekend and thought it was delightful. Yes, it's a commercial for \"Lotte Duty Free Mall,\" but it's short and engaging with lots of eye candy. This one can fulfill lots of the current drama challenges (numbers 1, 2, 11 \\[both Lee Min Ho and Park Hae Jin\\], and 12 \\[both EXO's Kai and 2PM's Taecyon\\] come to mind). \n\nProbably doesn't quite count as Throwback since it's 2019 and not pre-2019, but I'm still enjoying **Moment at Eighteen** (10/16). Still loving this one. And it also fits a number of challenges: numbers 1, 5 \\[hide the boyfriend, rich/poor couple\\], 7 \\[school, park, hospital, rooftop apartment, 8 \\[Kim Hyang Gi was 18 and turned 19 when this aired\\] , 9 \\[Kang Ki Yeong, Kim Sun Young\\], 12 \\[the late Moon Bin was an active member of ASTRO up to his tragic death\\], 17, 30\\]. I'm sure you can find PPL and food from the Wheel of Chance challenges, too, but I haven't paid attention.",

    "postText": "So I just finished watching AoS. I went into this show not really expecting to like it as I am not a huge historical fantasy type person, but I gave it a go because I heard so many good things about this drama. I also really liked the lead actor and lead actress for s1. When I started this drama, I was not aware that this was going to be a two season type thing, so season 1 finale kind of threw me for a loop.\n\nLet me start with season 1. I really enjoyed it! It was quirky and funny but also serious and suspenseful when it had to be. I am the type of kdrama watcher who likes to skip over scenes that don't really add to the main plot (ex: side character love stories), but I genuinely grew to love all of the characters! I especially held a soft sport for the crowned prince. Because of this, I didn't find myself skipping as much as I usually do (I still skipped through a good portion of the drama lol). I appreciated the tug of war type of love relationship that Mu-deok and Uk had because it never got boring and it made sense, for mu-deok, especially, to be the way she was (stubborn, distanced, and cold), but it also made it really satisfying when they would have moments of vulnerability or intimacy. Also, all the character interactions with the main characters felt genuine and believable. I didn't question the their motives or their interactions in a sense of storytelling. It was great casting with great writing! \\[spoiler incoming\\] Let's talk about the season finale. I was shocked to say the least, because as I mentioned before, I thought that this was only going to be a 1 season thing. I never really go into kdramas and expect another season because 98% of the time, that is not a thing! I'm don't really know how I feel (plot wise) about Mu-deok being forced to become the assassin that she became because of sorcery. Like, I understand that the story was heading towards her \"becoming Naksu\" again, but I hoped it would've been through her own free will. I wanted it to be a case of, she would become Naksu again and point her sword to who she wanted her enemies to be (if that makes sense). I'm not necessarily disappointed with the direction that the plot went in, and I get why they went in that direction, but it left me feeling a little...off?\n\nAny way, Season 2 \\[more spoilers ahead\\]. I am not a fan of season 2. I was a little disappointed when i found out that the actress for Mu-deok would not continue in season 2 but surprisingly, i didn't stay disappointed for too long. The actress that played Jin Bu-yeon was great and she did what she needed to do. Also, in terms of the writing, they did a pretty good job at explaining why she was in a different body/had a different face. I mean the whole plot kind of allowed for that with the soul shifting and whatnot. Honestly, I was convinced of Bu-yeons relationship with Uk, and I enjoyed knowing things that the characters did not. It allowed you to empathize with them and there were moments that i genuinely felt heart broken for the main couple. That's it for the good things. In season 2, as mush as i enjoyed the relationship between Bu-yeon and Uk, they really played too much into the love aspect, and honestly, even the side characters too. Most of season two was just Bu-yeon remembering memories of her time with Jang Uk and chasing after him. It wasn't satisfying once Bu-yeon remembered that she was Naksu, and it wasn't satisfying once Uk found out either. I started skipping most of their scenes because they were either sad, confused, or depressed. All the real progress of the plot happened within the last two episodes, maybe three. I think I just really disliked that they took away the spunk and sassiness that Naksu had because of her lost memories. I wish Buyeon was still sassy and stern and stubborn like Naksu was when she was Mudeok. I get that she might not have her memories, but that is her personality, her soul (maybe I'm just yelling into a void). I also found it quite annoying how long the villain lived. I also found it even more annoying how long he was able to keep his position despite consistently being proven to break countless sacred rules. If he was able to continue being a villain without being in the position he was in...cool! That makes more sense to me! But no, He stayed by the royal family until the very end and used them as puppets, which, I think, makes the authority of the royal family seem like such a joke. Also the switch of villains at the very end was even more annoying. I hated the first guy, but when his soul shifted to the other guy, I was over it. The other guy just looked annoying and not intimidating. I genuinely could not take him serious as a villain. And the way the villain died was also anticlimactic. Also, how are you going to kill of three important characters, have the rest of the characters cry and grieve them, only to \"just kidding! They're actually alive!\" all in one episode? And the finale at that!\n\nHonestly, it was a fun watch up until the last three episodes where it just started to drag. Please let me know if 1.) you read all of this, and 2.) if you agree with me with anything i said.",

Season 2 was good but not great in my opinion. The Mudeok - Uk relationship was perfectly played out to me in S1.",

It was the first and only series that I watched on-air, which magnified both the enjoyment and the frustration I felt watching. It was so fun going on the discussion boards reading everyone\u2019s theories and rants, and maddening when you had to wait for the next episodes\u2026 and then part 2!\n\nI agree with most of what you said. Part 1 was superior but the last episode was a total wtf moment. Those damn bells. Part 2 was OK - I wasn\u2019t as bothered by the actress change as I thought I would be. I thought Bu Yeon and Jang Uk chemistry was on fire. The writers were definitely phoning it in towards the end but tbh, I\u2019m just glad they gave our leads a happy ending!!!",

The staff working on the series praised GYJ left and right but forgot to mention JSM, who was the biggest reason why the series got so much attention and praise in the first place.\n\n\n\nLastly, I suggest you visit the subreddit for the show, people have expressed their opinions on the show a lot better than I have.",

I get that she might not have her memories, but that is her personality, her soul (maybe I'm just yelling into a void).\n\nThis goes to the heart of why Part 2 was a pale follow-on to Part 1.  Jang Uk fell in love with the sassy, stubborn, (and I will add *courageous*) Mu-deok.  Many viewers have attempted to rationalize why Cho-yeong/Naksu was so different in Part 2 {e.g.:  this is what Cho-Yeong would have been like if JinMu had not warped her}. But frankly, although GYJ is a good actress, she has not reached the talent level of JSM (8 years difference in experience still counts).  So, I understand why they made Cho-yeon/JBY rather bland, focused on the romance, and called it day with \"soul mates\" tripe, but at this point, I don't understand why they decided to add another 10 episodes, unless financing had something to do with it.\n\nPlus, although you didn't mention them, they ruined my favorite couple Cho-yeon and Dang-gu.  I still bear the scars.  \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude22\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude22\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude22",

The villain of the show was defeated and they continually gave everyone amnesia so the story would reach 30 episodes and it dragged down the conclusion.\n\nIt would have worked better if they cut 5 episodes and had the 2nd part as an effective epilogue to the show where Jang Uk comes to terms with what happens and Naksu gets her memories back without excessively padding that storyline out too. There didn't need to be another villain.\n\nBut if they were determined to have conflict, they could have made the plan of them wanting the ice stone a much coherent story with stronger political intrigue behind it. \n\nThat said i did quite enjoy the change in tone in part 2 and how they effectively flipped the roles of Naksu and Jang Uk. It made for a nice change of pace.",

            "comment": "Magic in a fictional historical realm with swords (esp women with swords) and a revenge plot is my absolute favorite type of media. I agree about the casting. Both parts of the series were bolstered by the cast being amazing and gelling really well with each other.\n\nI didn\u2019t care for any of the romantic plot lines in Part 2. Which is unfortunate because it seemed like Part 2 focused more on those. I was so upset with how they butchered every part of Naksu I liked from Part 1 that I was only half interested in Naksu/Uk finally reuniting. &gt;! We didn\u2019t even get there until ep 8 and then it had a shaky start, a good 10 min, then it started going back downhill. !&lt; I also personally did not like that we already knew who Bu Yeon was - especially since she didn\u2019t have any of the original character traits. I would have preferred if it was mystery for me and Uk lol I think it would have kept me more invested trying to figure out who she was instead of just waiting for her to regain memories. \n\nI understand trying to add levity and comedy in a show that got super dark all of a sudden but &gt;! ruthless monster Uk looking for his love to kill him (again) b/c he can\u2019t bear to live in a world where he\u2019s all powerful but the one thing he can\u2019t do is bring back the person he loves + guilt ridden Yul deciding to accept a horrendous death in repentence of his sins (instead of just seeing a dr and taking the medicine like bffr)  !&lt;\nshould\u2019ve just been a whole thing without the ridiculously saccarine and childlike foolishness of the other side characters (accept the Crown Prince and his turtle - they are exempt from everything negative)I don\u2019t think either the dark or the silly parts were bad individually but I didn\u2019t feel they worked well together. It just made the whole thing feel messy. \n\nAlso! I haven\u2019t seen a lot of people talk about Heo Yun Ok in Part 2 but I found her to be bad guy #3. She spent 3 years knowing that man did not want her and then became lowkey a bully when she realized Uk actually liked Bu Yeon. Like girl STAND UP. I also thought it was such a character turn b/c she seemed perfectly fine in Part 1. Maybe that\u2019s because she thought she had a chance with Uk but\u2026.personally\u2026I know she was integral to move the plot along towards the end but I was half hoping to see Bu Yeon regain her powers and whoop her ass. \n\nThe whole 2nd part just felt like bad plotting to me. The council, the fire bird, Bu Yeon/Naksu reveal, Uk grieving and coming to terms with being a \"monster\", all of those were great ideas (or at least started as having a lot of potential) but they weren\u2019t realized very well. I know it\u2019s hard to fit all of that in 10 episodes but if they weren\u2019t going to do it well they should\u2019ve just focused on making a spectacular ending and maybe adding a few extra episodes or an epilogue to the first one. \n\nMy main gripe is Bu Yeon (the character, not the actress or even that they changed actors from Part 1 to Part 2). They put the two most powerful women in the whole realm in one body, took away their memories, powers and personality, and instead of trying flesh her out character (or even just using their own source material from part 1) all they had her do for 7 episodes was pout, flirt, and say she was pretty but dumb. \n\nI understand why they made Bu Yeon a completely different character without Naksu\u2019s personality traits but then they did nothing to make this new character compelling. It\u2019s like the writers were still relying on the audience\u2019s good will towards Mu Deok/Naksu from part 1 and that Uk and Bu Yeon would eventually realize that she was Naksu so they didn\u2019t feel the need to flesh out Bu Yeon. And again - even if we\u2019re assuming Bu Yeon is basically like a child b/c she\u2019s been locked in a room with no memories or human interaction \u2014the writers spending more than half of a 10 episode series working that out by having her default be a dumb flirt is just boring. It\u2019s even offensive considering the character is part assassin part divine priestess.\n\nI\u2019ve still recommended the series to friends but I tell them to just watch ep 1-19 lol",

But at least we had a decent ending that wrapped things up neatly for everyone.\n\nThe OSTs songs in S1 and S2 were great, with my standout favorites being Raindrops, Blue Flower and I'm Sorry.",

I wanted to see more of this Korean Hogwarts, but that's another thing entirely.\n\nAt its core though, and this is just my interpretation, that the historical fantasy stuff is just window dressing for a story about grief and finding love despite of it. The first season deals with, essentially, two orphans. We see two parental figures dealing with grief in their own way and falling in love. \n\nYou can think of season 1 as being a love story of a terminally ill woman and a lonely young man. Their fight for the ice stone was nothing more than the quest for medical treatments that could save her life. \n\nSeason 2 is about Jang Uk moving on from that loss. He does find love again with someone new, loving her really from herself as Naksu didn't really have Mu-deok's personality at the start. The poetic \"their love was eternal\" stuff is just part of the fantasy soul reincarnating part of the story. Without it, Jang Uk was just doing what his \"parents\" did in the first season, and that was moving on. \n\nSo it's grief, finding love, grieving, and finding love again. \n\nJust my interpretation. I still want a third season of just them two solving problems and just having a more solid magic system. But that's not really necessary.",

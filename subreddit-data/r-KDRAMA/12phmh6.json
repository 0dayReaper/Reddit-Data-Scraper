I want to love it but it just isn't clicking for me right now.  Maybe I can pick it up again later.",

KBS world tv on YouTube breaks an episode in 3 parts and uploads it with English sub.\n\nIt does at times give of a daily soap vibe with the sets and acting. Surprising I found the  4 leads better than the senior actors but now I have warmed up to the whole cast. The chemistry between the actors is good and it is genuinely funny at times even though it touches on a lot of serious topics and handles them fairly well. \n\nMy curiosity made me to google search the show and turns out Viki uploads the full episodes and I totally binged watched the whole thing.\n\nDo check it out for some good fun light watch.",

They started with *Good Job*, and have had a couple of good ones since then, and seem like a smaller, somewhat alternative sort of channel - they're not one of the big players. Yoo In Na is definitely an established actress who is liked, but I guess the shows has competition, and the premise isn't an easy one to be sure about. I'm curious, but can't watch it because it's streaming on a platform I don't use (and that platform's not the biggest, especially for Korean drama series), although this doesn't affect the above ratings, of course.",

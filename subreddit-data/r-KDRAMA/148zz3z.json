            "comment": "Completed: **Hyena**\r, I loved it! \r\n\r\nThe drama is more about the leads, their banters, flirty interactions than the actual law elements. Their style of solving the cases is also unconventional, they are more comfortable in dealing the cases in the most illegal way possible. And they work in private firms as chaebol's minions and care about money and wins above anything. So watch this drama to see if you can root for hyena like ~~villains~~ leads lol.\r\n\r\nKim hye soo reigned the drama. Her character was also the most well written one, had the necessary depth and surprisingly didn't need any growth despite her being the actual hyena in this drama- classless, did the dirty works to win the case, clever and fierce and didn't hesitate to backstab to get the meal she eyed. And she stayed the same, only her multi-layered character gradually got uncovered to show her true self.\r\n\r\nJoo ji hoon's character had all the necessary growths a sheltered, over ambitious corporate lawyer actually needed. He was smart, sexy as well as dumb and puppy like as his character demanded. The entire cast was brilliant and had great comedic timing.\r\n\r\nThe plot is interesting too, though not much substantial, I liked that the drama subtly jabbed at the legal system in a sarcastic way without being preachy at all. I specifically liked the chaebol kids case, it was more like a filler tbh but it showed how private lawyers are actually minions of chaebols and Khs's roast at jjh indirectly preached the true purpose of a lawyer- to work for justice not to clean after the rich.\r\n\r\nFor the downsides, plot conveniences were too apparent and the wining strategy of 'find dirt, blackmail and win' was overused. Like in most drama focusing on entertainment than strong writing, filler scenes were extra obvious, so was the ppl. \r\n\r\nBut everything else was too good. The fun bgm and catchy ost, well timed comedy, fantastic acting made the drama very enjoyable. Oh another caution, some actions like using unfair means to win non-winnable cases may make you feel uncomfortable and leads competing against upright prosecutors may make you feel confused and Khs's character may feel highly questionable, but everything fits well if you manage to get pass these without feeling strongly about them. After all, irl lawyers are mostly goal-oriented like them and few are like atty woo or atty shin.\r\n\r\nVery entertaining drama. Best wacky drama I have seen lately, 10x better than the similar wacky drama **vincenzo**. Overall **(8/10)**",

Not that our staid ML is as predictable as he looks either! It's a bit too fast paced at times and also seems to be deliberately confusing the audience, as a result of which the characters don't seem as real as they should. But the show is definitely engaging and I'm in for the ride.\n\n**Bitch x Rich** (4/10) - A high school bullying drama where the good FL is as unlikable as the bad FL. Hope the upcoming clashes are more interesting than the story set-up till now.\n\n**Battle For Happiness** (4/16) - This makjang-style murder mystery is all tensions and undercurrents and shocking revelations. I'm loving it!\n\n**Queenmaker** (5/11) - How is it that every Kdrama I'm watching these days has strong, badass women? This is another one where the men stand around quietly while the women run the world. The political backdrop is a bit dry and the nasty chaebols are as cliche as they come. The show isn't anything outstanding as yet, but the actresses are too compelling and I'm gonna watch till the end.\n\n**Love Tractor** (2/8) - Cute beginning though nothing very exciting till now. The rural backdrop is a sight for sore eyes though.",

That was a lovely surprise in the &gt;!midst of the endless misery.!&lt;\n\n**The Real Has Come! \\[24/50\\]** \\- After 20 episodes, I realised this does not stop airing until september. SEPTEMBER.

This has been an amazing binge. Some people seem to hate the comedy, but I am thoroughly enjoying it. I love comedy, I love a masked hero, and I love Joowon. It's the perfect recipe\n\n**The King's Affection \\[2/20\\]** \\- In my desperation for distractions as I am starting a new job this week, I decided to finally watch this. I hate when dramas start off with a looong flashback, and almost reaching the 3rd episode without seeing the main actors was definitely testing my patience. So glad I'm done with that",

I liked how they weaved in Korean and Japanese myths and legends to historical events. \n\n&gt;!The FL didn't seem to serve much of a purpose with she just ticking off the badass FL box. But she came to her own in the last few episodes. I also liked how they set up the climax in the last four episodes instead of keeping everything till the last episode. Having said that the last episode was the best. There were few unanswered questions but maybe there is another season? !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Also season 1 viewers said it doesn't tie up with what was shown in season 1. But since I didn't watch it it didn't make a difference.!&lt;\n\n**The Fiery Priest (16/20)** - After months of keeping this on hold again and again the end is finally in sight. &gt;! I am glad they started making bigger wins after the FL joined the gang. Also it's good to see a genuine sismance develop between the FL and SFL. These are the two positives about the show. Otherwise the show is a series of repetitive outcomes happening again and again with the director focused on characters making an entry in slow motion only for the villains to get better of them. As if having six villains was not enough we have new ones making a late entry.!&lt; But hurray! The end is near and I hope I will finish it soon.",

Doesn\u2019t matter if you didnt watch S2, go watch S2 lol also anyone else finding themself obsessing over Yeon\u2019s hair colour whenever he\u2019s on screen? Its so not my colour but that man can pull off anything\n\n\nWatching: \n\nI started alchemy of souls last night and stayed up to watch almost 3 episodes. It\u2019s been interesting so far. I already love the ML. I haven\u2019t seen his previous work but i know the FL from because this is my first time. She\u2019s good at what she does! And I liked the funny mage, the one with energy of forest or something. I\u2019m sorry for getting anything incorrect.. There\u2019s a lot of characters n flashbacks n magic politics which I\u2019m still trying to make sense of. \n\nBUT today I saw alchemy of souls part 2 being mentioned on the refund my time thread today and now I\u2019m heartbroken lol. Apparently they changed the FL actress(?) Yep 9/10 times it doesn\u2019t sit well with the viewers. While watching I looked up the drama n saw some stills from it and saw a new face with jang uk i was so confused. But now it makes sense.",

            "comment": "I finished **The Good Bad Mother.** This was really good. The story and the actors were great. Is there anything Lee Do Hyun cannot do?\n\nRewatching **Crash Course in Romance.** I've binged right through it. After my Hospital Playlist obsession I wanted to see Jung Kyung Ho in this role again. He's just so good in this and is chemistry with Jeon Do Yeon is off the charts. I'm almost done, and even though I was not fond of some of the plotlines&gt;! (the return of the mother, etc.) !&lt; I still think this is an outstanding drama. \n\nStill watching HP and HP2 Behind the Scenes you tube videos. Has anyone else seen the First Table Read video. The entrance and introduction of the actors, script reading, and greetings are great insights to their personalities. Of note is, of course, Jung Kyung Ho's greeting to Kim Heo Sook. He kisses her hand! And his long hair is great!  When we can see these moments, we can see that these are Actors thoughtfully portraying characters. And kdrama seems to have so many great actors.\n\nTried to get into **Dali and the Cocky Prince** and I am not going to continue. Also, I've watched about half of **Dr. Romantic 2** \\+ a few episodes of **Dr. Romantic** for the backstory. I'll probably finish DR2, because I really want to see Ahn He Seop and Yoo Teon Sook act together as their characters. I really hope there will be a legal place to watch this in the US soon!\n\nThere are so many good new dramas beginning this week (King the Land and My 19th Life) + Outlander begins. I'm usually a bing-watcher, but I might need to see these as they air.\n\nHave a great week!",

The only enjoyable part of this movie was the ending credits with cute cast selfies (could've done without 'Call Me Maybe' on replay though lol). Messy is the best way to describe it. Characters flip-flopping between feelings and decisions with zero build up or warning. I lost count how many times the FL changed her mind what guy to date. Her immediately befriending the mean girl who LITERALLY set her up and had her &gt;!stripped naked in bed with a dodgy man!&lt;. Plot all over the place. It was a waste of my time\n\n**Heaven? (2019)**  \nIf Jang Manwol was japanese and owned a french restaurant, this would be it. The outfits, the confidence, the graveyard...I was very much reminded of Manwol. It was a fun lighthearted watch with interesting characters and shenanigans. Japanese humor can be a bit of a hit or miss for me, but they did a pretty good job of not being *too* over the top imo\n\n**Secret Royal Inspector &amp; Joy (2021)**  \nI'm a sucker for lighthearted sageuks. I enjoyed it a lot, but struggled to stay interested tbh. I'm not sure why. I probably ruined it for myself by watching it to slowly (I started it mooonths ago). I also watched *Secret Royal Inspector* right before and I enjoyed that one a bit more\n\n**30-sai made Dotei Da to Mahotsukai ni Nareru rashii (2020)**  \nI spontaneously decided to watch this one and it was a great decision. A short but lovely BL with wholesome characters and a wholesome romance. If you're looking for a drama with completely non-toxic leads and a non-toxic and just wholesome romance, then look no further because this is it. I'm annoyed there was no &gt;!kiss between the main couple!&lt; but their chemistry was so good it wasnt a huge deal, but still a little disappointing",

I know it\u2019s only listed as a mystery but anything with a serial killer is a thriller to me lol. Since I\u2019m not a fan of thrillers, I like other genres to be present like how Link: Eat, Love, Kill and You Are My Spring have really prominent romance and healing themes, even some comedy. This show does some of that but not a lot imo. Anywho, I\u2019m ready to have it confirmed who did it.\n\n**Empress Ki (17/51):** just started this one back up\n\n\n**Recently Completed**\n\n**Doctor Cha:** I really enjoyed this drama for the first 13ish episodes. The husband, mistress, and MIL were awful but the husband made me laugh a lot \ud83d\ude02 I liked watching Dr Cha get back into medicine. I liked Dr Roy! Dr Cha\u2019s friend was good as well. The son and his gf grew on me, they were cute! Some point between episode 13 and the end, my feelings changed though. I think the repeat of &gt;!Dr Cha\u2019s illness and who was gonna donate, etc.!&lt; bored me. I also got annoyed with the shamelessness of the trio. The ending was good to me. &gt;!Dr Roy finding someone else makes sense because Cha never liked him. It was a little silly to have him like her as much as he did for them not to get together but it did bring some entertainment lol. Cha being independent was great. Worse could\u2019ve happened to husband and mistress but at least everyone has moved on?? It seems like the ex husband is attempting to atone his sins for both Cha and Seung Hui by being at their beck and call.!&lt;Overall, I could\u2019ve done without the last few episodes but when it was good, it was gooddd. 7/10 for me \n\n**Oh! Youngsim:** this show is right there with my least favorite drama. I love a good childhood connection but these 2 had no chemistry in the present day. Nothing happened in their adult life for them to still like each other. We spend the entire series watching them dance around each other. Then &gt;!they get together at the end of ep 9 and break up in ep 10!!! He leaves the country, there\u2019s a time skip, and then he comes back and begs.!&lt; All within the last 20 minutes of the show \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab Also, their reasoning for their behavior in the past was awful. Overall, the writing, acting, chemistry, everything was either bad or mid \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab The main reason I stuck with it is because I watched it airing and I\u2019m not the best dropper lol. I hope all of them pick better projects next.",

No, but I don't mind that too much. What it did right was all I could ask for. The three lead actors are wonderful. I discovered Ra Mi Ran here, and I feel in love with Ahn Eun Jin. Lee Do Hyun, I've been a fan of his since 18 Again, and I felt like his other dramas were not to my taste. But this? Reminded me why I'm a big fan again. 9/10. Highly recommend it if you're ready to cry from time to time.\n* **Bloodhounds (8/8)** \u2014 This drama was awesome, and I'm so glad Woo Do Hwan starred in it cause he deserves all the love he's getting from it. His brotherly chemistry with Lee Sang Yi was next level. You can tell they're pretty close, too, from their Netflix videos together or I Live Alone episode. Also, choreography is another huge plus. Some of those fight scenes were so tense and brutal, I couldn't look away. I really enjoyed it. However ... I disliked the last 2 episodes a lot. I was so bored and I didn't care for anything that was happening, which sucks cause I was so invested in the first 6 episodes. This would've easily been a 9/10, but the last 2 episodes made me give it a 7.5/10.\n* **Itaewon Class (16/16)** \u2014 Man, I hate to say this, but I hated this drama. I did not care for a lot of characters or plotlines. The romance sucked, and really, everything that wasn't the revenge took away from the story for me. 2/10. I would not watch this again.\n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n* **A Business Proposal (8/12)** \u2014 This drama is still a 10/10 so far. I'm happy the whole time I watch it. I'm loving the ML even more now, despite the fact that I felt neutral about him at first. Second couple is so adorable, too.",

One of the things I love about xanxia is the joy I feel in willingly suspending my disbelief. I have moments where I think, \"this CGI is terrible and the entire premise is batshit crazy and I am *here for it*\"!",

            "comment": "*Completed*:\n\n**Bloodhounds**: It was nice. The action was good, loved Heo Joon Ho with his old guy squad and the revenge story that spawned. But sadly the two protagonists where because of that very much sidelined for almost half the show and that's really not good. Woo Jin(Lee Sang Yi) especially lost out because of that. Also: Woo Do Hwan is really great at playing earnestly sweet guys. It's his smiles that are even in his eyes.\n\n**Pied Piper**: Needed some Shin Ha Kyun in my life again, and he served. Great acting by him and Yoo Joon Sang. The story was great as well. Using the story of the Pied Piper for a villain was fantastic and his method of commiting crimes was inventive. But a major flaw: the colour grading was really bad. It's either very washed out or yellow-brown (similiar to NYC sky due to Canadian Wildfires)\n\n*In-Progress*\n\n**Run On (6/16)**: Really fantastic. Love the main couple. They have great chemistry and such a nice relationship. And it's so realistic and slice-of-life like. It's also very gorgeous and colourful, with some great scene transitioning. And Yim Si Wan is just so pretty.\n\n**Gaus Electronics (6/12)**: It's okay. It can be funny, but often it doesn't hit my humour. It's a bit too over the top and slap-sticky for me. Some of the best moments are the serious ones. And Aziz. Aziz is great.\n\n**Queen Seon Deok (12/62)**: After a timeskip the adult actors are here, and it really found its groove. Earlier I was a bit unconvinced about the FL, but she is really good now. And A+ for the young-old version casting. Both actresses have a very similar smile. Fls situation is also very interesting. She is now hiding as a man under the Hwarang soldiers and fought a war. So it kinda turned into *Mulan* and I'm in love with that.",

            "comment": "***Nokdu Flower (4/24)*** After watching *Mr. Sunshine*, I wanted to watch more Sageuks covering that time period and I especially wanted something serious that wasn't a romcom. Even though I've barely scratched the surface of this, I'm enjoying it a lot. The performances are strong and I can't wait to see how everything unfolds.  I don't recognize many actors by name, but there are so many faces that I've appreciated in other dramas and that I'm happy to see here. The female actors are mostly unknown to me and so far I can't take my eyes off of them. My husband really loves the historical stuff and though we usually only watch dramas in the evening, he is hinting he might want to break that habit because he's so engrossed in this already and is eager to see more of it. Also, the music is a bit edgy and intriguing.",

            "comment": "I'm watching three dramas right now:\n\n**Suspicious Housekeeper** (9/20). This is an older drama and production values are not quite as high as other dramas. Some of the acting is definitely over the top, but an interesting story line. And now it seems this may turn into a thriller?\n\n**Hotel Del Luna** (5/16). This drama is visually stunning. I love the FL. I find that I'm more interested in the back story than the current story. I like the drama, but don't *love* it.\n\n**Trot Lovers** (7/16). So far, I'm really liking this one, but I have read some spoilers and find that we'll be heading into (this is only a vague spoiler, but I tagged it just in case) &gt;!some of my least favorite tropes in the next few episodes.  !&lt; So, I'll see how I tolerate that.",

Hot take; Jeremy Brett is the BEST Sherlock.",

FL has a lot of toxic ideas about relationships and so far even her breakup isn\u2019t teaching her enough lessons. For a person who gives advice she really lacks insight, empathy, and understanding. I really hope the ML doesn\u2019t have to carry everything in the relationship. I\u2019m planning to finish it and hoping it gets better. While it\u2019s nowhere near the worst kdrama I\u2019ve seen (looking at you, Boys Over Flowers) it\u2019s not on track to be all that great.",

            "comment": "I've caught up on **The Real Has Come**, and am pretty happy about where things stand -- even the darkness on the horizon looks like it will be fun to watch. The school president story line is just annoying.\n\nI wrapped up my **Just Between Lovers** rewatch and am *really* looking forward to **King the Land** this weekend. Does Jun Ho ever play anything but confident? I don't actually care, because I can't get enough of him.\n\nI am about 5 episodes into **The Memorist**, which I'm enjoying so far. It stars Yoo Seung Ho and Lee Se Young , both of whom I enjoy. They haven't had much opportunity to show off their acting chops, but I feel like now the two leads' storylines have converged there'll be more time for character development. The drama has been very plot focused so far.\n\nFinally, I watched the J Drama **Kakafukaka**, which . . . made me uncomfortable. I'm still processing it, and I'm certain that there were things that I didn't fully understand on a cultural level. But I think my main point of discomfort was that everyone was just using the FL however they saw fit, and she was okay with it even once she magically found her self-confidence again. Surely this wasn't the point of the drama! If anyone has a different read on this, I would love to hear it.",

            "comment": "Just finished **Gye Baek, a Warrior's Fate** \\- produced in 2011 so different style of production but a very worthwhile watch. Gye Baek is a historical figure from the Kingdom of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms. He is considered to be heroic by Korea for his character and his military abilities. He was one of the last generals for the Kingdom of Baekje as shortly after his death, Silla conquered Baekjee, and ultimately united all three Kingdoms. The plot/story is fictional for the most part. Time period - mid to late 600 BCE. Viewer will have to accept that the casting may have been a little 'off' in the first half as the actor for the King and the actor for his son are only one year apart in age and it does show. Not that hard to dismiss it.",

(Although 2023 has thus far been such an underwhelming year for me for K Dramas.)\n\nThis is a series that you don't really watch, but you experience. Note - It will *NOT* be for everyone - there is no overarching plot, viewers might wonder what the point is, where the story is leading....but that is the beauty of it.\n\nI remember reading another poster's comment that she would watch one episode a night, to chill at the end of the day. And that's what I did and it's really meant for that kind of viewing experience.\n\nAnyone looking for a whimsical, poignant, sweet, totally chill way to spend the evening whilst discovering parts of Korea would really enjoy this. Reminded me of Am\u00e9lie, the lovely French film. It's beautiful, light, sad, feel-good, heartbreaking all rolled into one. But ultimately affirming and uplifting.",

It sounds like it\u2019s missing a word that relates \u201cKing\u201d to the \u201cLand\u201d. \n\nAgain, no disrespect meant, I\u2019m just curious. I\u2019m a Lee Junho fan and would love to see this drama be well received like the Red Sleeve. I am not familiar with Yoona\u2019s dramas but I support the pairing. I also love the snsd song Genie :)",

The show peaks during the prison arc, with the mystery of who is Big Mouse while ML is faking it till he makes it and the show keeps you guessing as to whether ML was really framed by Big Mouse, or ***is*** Big Mouse and is conning everyone. After the reveal of Big Mouse, loses steam and the ending is unsatisfying, although it tries to pick things up.\n\nI get the message of the ending - some villains just have to be dealt with killing them, because you can't use the law and political power against them, but it was pretty hamfisted and executed too hurriedly and unsatisfyingly (although the way they off the final villain was quite thematically fitting).\n\nI feel Big Mouse is a show that's better experienced week by week, rather than in a binge. Its weaknesses are more apparent, watching all episodes in one go. But as a week by week show, it was a ride.\n\nStill, I was entertained. And I will note that I have no complaints about Yoona or Lee Jong-suk's performances in the show.",

The mystery on who is the big mouse didn't reach a satisfying conclusion + the main lead's character development took a weird turn and the problem with the villain was abruptly solved. The show suffered from bad writing and at some point even Lee Jong Suk gave up on trying to give a believable performance. If you really want to watch, go ahead, first few episodes were okay.",

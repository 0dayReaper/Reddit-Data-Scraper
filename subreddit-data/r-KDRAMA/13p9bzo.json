I bet it will still be a satisfying quality watch if it is watched ten years later. \n\nBtw, genuinely curious, is there anyone who thinks otherwise?",

I kind of think of it as the K-drama version of Top Gun, but with fewer planes.  \n\n\nGoblin I get--I have the same issue that a lot of people have with the main couple, but the thing works as a whole, anyway.  \n\n\nSquid Game isn't my kind of thing, but it's good.   \n\n\nThe rest I haven't seen, but I think I'll try When the Camellia Blooms.",

I think  Squid Game and Stranger will stand the test of time.  WtCB, morality seems to be imbedded - single motherhood, female running a bar, orphanhood, etc.  It's not everyone's cup of tea, esp. if non-Korean, because a lot of the funny parts got lost in translation (Kang Ha-neul's regional accent and mannerisms, etc.)\n\nAnd am gutted for Baeksang 2023 best drama which went to The Glory, which IMO, the least deserving.  Our Blues and My Liberation Notes should have won.  Even Little Women was more deserving because of the artsy setting and the twisty story line.  And of course almost everyone love Atty. Woo.",

Not really worthy of daesang btw xD\n\nIgnoring the romance part of goblin, the concept was interesting. I haven't watched most other nominated drama (only Dr romantic) so can't say if it was a deserving win or not. Btw I am watching a similar Taiwanese drama **rainless love in a godless land** and enjoying it more than goblin. The concept is original, refreshing and wonderfully executed.\n\nStranger 100% deserves the daesang. Like it can compete in every year and still win it. There are obviously better drama in terms of plot, but as a whole, stranger is almost perfect. None of the elements of a drama (plot, cast-main/supports/extra, acting, editing, pacing, directing style, bgm, whatever else is there) overpowered anything or anyone rather created a harmonious balance maintaining a consistent strong quality, which is extremely rare in a kdrama. Well, I haven't found any, so stranger remains the unparalleled top kdrama for me.",

            "comment": "My Liberation Notes was a Baeksang nominee but did not win this past year.\n\nHowever, it was a worthy follow-up to My Mister since both were written by the same writer, Park Hae-young, whose name carries as much weight in the kdrama world as Christopher Nolan\u2019s does in western cinema. \n\nMy Mister was a superior story but MLN was very poetic and the dialogue was on a different level to any kdramas out there. A lot was stated about quiet desperation and it\u2019s a topic that Koreans both relate to but also loathe to discuss. The writer illustrated it beautifully in each character and setting. Cannot wait to see her next project.",

It's fine from my perspective as Kdrama and Cdrama probably make up 80 to 90% of my viewing these days but they really are in a weird place just now.\n\nI suppose I already knew it subconsciously it's just quite stark going through the titles. If I wasn't into Kdrama there's no way I'd be paying the sub, it's not cheap either.",

I got a two week trial to Kocowa this week so I could watch Children of Nobody since I missed it in 2018. It\u2019s very good. But had to try a bunch of either too silly, too slow, etc to keep my interest until I found it on Kocowa. Agree with most about Call it Love on Hulu. The ads were horrible and the show itself way too slow for me. I rarely if ever FF thru a kdrama cuz I have to use subtitles and afraid I might miss something crucial\u2026lol",

I tried to branch out but I really don't like thrillers, horror or anything too violent/graphic. Romance dramas have started to mix genres which I find hit or miss most of the time.  Nowadays, I find myself gravitating towards cdramas more and more because they have the fluffy romance dramas I like.

Although it would make a classic k-dramay k-drama, but I would love to see Hell Romance (Devilish Romance?) being adapted into a drama! I love the demon-human ML and the sassy prosecutor FL teaming up and trying to find a serial killer. It would be so cool.",

But Sehun looks like he is in his late twenties play high schooler and it's a little bit too much. I mean he looks like he is their teacher.  I can't seriously watch it. Which is sad, I actually wanted you watch it. Am I the only one? I can't be the only one who thinks that was like really not it. What the director was thinking casting actor in high school drama someone who is clearly looks for his age aka in late twenties. I guess the only reason is that he in Exo and this is tving production. Ratings make everything possible.",

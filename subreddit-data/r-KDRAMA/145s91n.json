This show writes women well imo\n\nI'm not ready for things to end! When I see such day-brightening chemistry among a drama's cast it's hard to let that kind of effect go. \n\nSide note: my screenshots folder (aka my cluttered desktop) is overflowing with grabs. The cinematography this season but particularly in this episode has been fantastic.",

Then, we have the Snail Bride and Eun Ho out there trying to save the nation. The former whose skill is sewing and the latter whose life is the most fragile among the main cast. As for the gisaengs, I completely understand how scared they were -- that'd be me lol. I actually felt that they were in a tough place because it's not like Lee Rang and his bandit gang are nice people to defy.",

Now the OG mountain god + the other main villains all need to be dealt with in 1 episode and the hypnosis guy was dealt with remarkably fast (though there's a chance he didn't die yet I guess)",

But it was an awesome scene nonetheless.\n\nOpium Yeon giving mermaid the dad talk was hilarious, and Rang and Yeon making up was soothing to the soul. That being said this development should drastically change the future. I feel like the show didn't show that in particular because it is a can of worms and will take another episode to resolve. Best guess season 3 will address this.\n\nJae yoo getting hurt was more moving than MY supposedly dieing. Luckily both are alive so there is some redemption for MY character development in season 3.\nTo think about it he didn't serve a significant purpose than actually bringing LY to 1938 and raising original mountain God for season 3.\n\nLY and Ji ah reunion was sweet.\n\nLoved, the season 1 OST during the final fight. I realised how much i missed this song. Season 2 OST in comparison is not at par with season1.\n\nFor season 3 LY goes to Josean era.\n\nMy last wish was reunion between Ki Yu ri and Lee Rang. Am I the only one that missed them?",

We got Miss Mermaid, Little Mermaid, and Mrs. Bandit Gang lol. Even Lee Mi Yeon has a name people call haha..tho it's just Shin Joo. \n\nSome initial thoughts before I digest this episode:\n\nI felt a little bit sad for Moo Yeong. We all saw it coming though...I gotta say I'm a bit overwhelmed &gt;!now there's a new big bad \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8!&lt;. However, this means episode 12 might be a EPIC BATTLE and I'm here for that! \n\nWhen Yeon told Rang &gt;!a splinter on Rang's finger hurt his heart more than the multiple sword wounds on his body!&lt; my heart melted. S2 Rang is getting all of the words of affirmation and love from Yeon that S1 Rang yearned for so badly \ud83d\ude2d. And then, he asked for his brother's help...\ud83e\udd79. Dang, Opium Yeon needs to step up! It's not like there's no brother in this era!\n\nI'm so glad they remember the Fortune God's gift to Yeon. I feel like the writers are thoughtful this season with smaller details that contribute to the richness of larger story. Last season, I felt like Ji Ah's parents' roles fizzled out by the end. Also, minor characters are treated to glimpses that don't take up too much time, but still enrich our understanding of them. I'd like to see more of course, for example enough to remember Yeo Hee's name lol, but I'm pretty satisfied with what we got considering the 12 episode format. \n\nExcept of course Moo Yeong. Oh, Moo Yeong. So you knew how much you were doing Yeon dirty!! Why?? I know why...but why?? I feel like Moo Yeong is more similar to Grieving Yeon here. In the aspect of how his grief, and dogged search for a dead beloved, ends up hurting everyone around him. Neither of them had friends while the hurt Lee Rang, oddly enough, still inspired love and loyalty in both seasons. \n\nThis is why Hong Joo is the best lol. She's lost so much but still has so much love to give others around her. You don't see her getting addicted to opium, stabbing her friend's lil brother, or burning down human villages!! \ud83d\ude4c Hong Joo #1!!! Really...the women on this show are so much healthier than the men lol. At least, when they plan to burn shit down it's colonialism.",

Damn it why is Kim Bum such a good actor!! But I'm glad the Rang of 1938 &gt;!got his hyung &amp; his mermaid at least for the timebeing!&lt;\n\n\\-I really liked the way they left this ending such that it's not a HUGE cliffhanger like Vagabond but there's enough story for them to make a sequel if they want, which tracks with what the actors have said in their interviews so far (that there's no solid plan yet, but they're open to a sequel if this season worked well)\n\n\\-Moo Young &gt;!coming back though!&lt;...not sure how I really feel about that. His character was weak to begin with, and it feels like other than his moment of regret he didn't really have much consequences for his actions? &gt;!His saving Yeon in the end was fine but we know he could've handled that; Even Hong Joo didn't seem to bat an eyelid that he put the people she cares about in so much danger !&lt;\n\n\\-Rang's random &gt;!power arc leaves !&lt;SO MUCH TO BE EXPLAINED. &gt;!WTF was that about? How did he suddenly have full gumiho powers? Did Yeon do something? Is it brought about in times of real distress?!&lt; Hope its elaborated on if there's a next season!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall though, I feel like they managed to stick the landing by balancing action &amp; emotion with the pacing they've brought all season and still open up a potential sequel in a not too cliffhangery way. But now I'm sad bc I haven't been this invested in an ongoing drama since Vincenzo was airing &amp; I can already feel the void in my weekends",

It was nice seeing the wrap up of all the characters in the past but I wish a bit more time had been spent in present day showing what happened when Yeon got back. Are future-Taluipa\u2019s eyes gone too? Did the evil mountain god also go to the future? !&lt;\n\n&gt;! The Kato-is-a-mountain god reveal should have happened wayyy sooner.

And ngl Moo-yeong getting a free pass after everything he did this season really isn\u2019t settling well. He\u2019s killed so many people! He revived an ancient evil mountain god! And he just gets to live out his dream life. !&lt;\n\n\nOverall thoughts: \nI think I really really enjoyed this season as it was airing and it\u2019s highlight has really been it\u2019s treatment of the characters. The friendship between the mountain gods, the side characters, and of course the brotherhood. But the plot has been frustrating and if there isn\u2019t a s3 to tie up these loose ends it will greatly weaken the ending of this season and make it a difficult rewatch.",

Hong Joo got a year in hell or whatever for killing the human \n\nMY's intentions were pure/understandable enough, especially as a show which is most popular for the rs between 2 brothers to begin with, but he (potentially) and literally hurt so.many.people. &gt;!Why in the world does he just get a free pass and acceptance from his friends? !&lt;\n\nFor Yeon changing the past though, I think what Taluipa said stands. What happened in our Yeon's life doesn't change. Rang probably reincarnated as that kid we already saw in S1 because he completed his mission to retrieve the stone successfully, which is as much as Yeon could've asked for. What will change is the version of events from this 1938 onwards, ultimately still resulting in Rang's death since he lowkey knows now that's where it ends.",

Now that I think about it, that's probably what I was watching for lol. I'm not a critical drama watcher though, especially for this type of drama, my baseline is that I shouldn't feel like the writers think I'm dumb lol. I guess what I'm saying is, I didn't expect things to be deep or fantastic lol. \n\nI think S1 aimed to have more emotional depth and seriousness given Ji Ah and Rang's plotline and the disappointing philosopher Imoogi, but audiences were divided on who got to survive. S2 gave those of us who wanted to see more Yeon x Rang (definitely more Happy Rang lol) + a side serving of happy ending for Yeon x Ji ah. Since I fell into the second camp, this season delivered enough for me even if it was imperfect. \n\nOh, I didn't speculate about the effects of time travel because I didn't believe the Old Lady's \"rules\" that seem like she made up nor viewed the show through a time travel lens. Probably because I didn't understand enough of their world building -- that I would've loved more explanation on. Since we never got it, I just treated the show lightly. \n\nHowever, I would definitely love to see a S3.",

Unless they butcher the story and he somehow gets 1 hit by Yeon for the sake of rushed pacing, which will be horrible. But most kdrama has had sloppy ending due to digging too much of a hole to fill, so..\n\nHe SHOULD be left for the rumoured season 3; maybe he managed to slip behind and follow Yeon back go to his original era where Yeon will have the time to deal with him. Opening season 3 with a small fight when they land then him escaping and facing off again down the line would be a good idea. Kind of a 'revenge for Mo Yeong' season.\n\nI'm hoping 1938 Yeon joins in the final fight (somehow, though he will be completely clueless, but he can be the wild card) so there will be 2 Yeons for the villians to deal with, maybe even 'switching outfit' to confuse them. That way the one being strangled by the governor might not even be 2020 Yeon, cool twist. Also 2020 Yeon can advice 1938 Yeon to stay and treat Rang better to close season 2.\n\nBut these are too much daydreaming speculations.\n\nI do feel abit bad for Mo Yeong at the end, but after what he has done, despite having his reason and constantly mentioned to be this 'kind person who wouldn't even kill an animal', this is his deserving death. I lowkey thought he will die outside (the moment Taluipa's husband saw him) and get the ruler snagged by a villian (before the Mercenaries were even revealed to still be alive).",

Or was it a plotline which was dropped/yet to be used?\nWill Yeohee be able to sing/scream again? \nWill Yeon &amp; Rang ever be reunited with their father, and why was he such an awful parent? If Gumiho's only have one partner for life, why was their father sleeping around? \nWho is Yeon's mother?\nWhy doesn't anyone recognise Yuri looks exactly like Eun-ho in 2020?\nWhat trials did they have to do to succeed in becoming mountain gods?\nIf that wasn't Moo's brother, what actually happened to him?\nWho unfroze Moo?\nDoes it matter that Moo stayed in the past since technically there are now two of him in the same era permanently, albeit one version rock-ified.  \nDid Rang complete his wish contract with Yeohee? \nWhere are they all in the future? Did anything change at all? \nDid Taluipa get her eyes back in the future? \nDid Yeon manage to save Rang, either Rang himself or complete his contract and manage to get him reborn? (I presume he did cause we saw him reborn as a child in Season 1, but is this the same timeline that Yeon has returned to?\nIf this is the same timeline, then logically things must have changed at least a little - because Rang now has a life partner and can go full Gumiho, neither of which he could do/had before, so did they find a way to save him, and where is Yeohee in the future? How are Shinju's family now he's back in the future? I thought Yeon went to the past about a month after Rang died, in 2020, so why did it cut to 2023 when he returned? Production error, or did he actually get returned to 2020, and the scene we saw was actually him coming back from another mission three years later? What's gonna happen now Moo accidently resurrected the original mountain god? I got the feeling that Hongjoo might have finally move on from Yeon, so is she going to persue something more with Moo? When will Yeon from 1938 get his act together? Will the Shinju from 1938 become friends with the wolf and puppy again? Will Taluipa continue to try and punish Moo? When will Yeon lose his way &amp; use his tattoo from the luck baby god? Why is the 4th mountain god, Black Bear's story so separate from the other 3, what's his story, and does he ever resent that the other three gods are practially family whilst he's the odd one out - think he ever feels like 3's company 4's a crowd? SO MANY QUESTIONS \n\nbut despite all the uncertainty, I still really love this show, and I guess it just goes to show how well fleshed out the characters and their relationships with each-other are to generate this many questions about their story, and if we do get a season 3, then I'm confident we'll get answers to at least SOME of my questions, and the rest I'll have to rely on my own version of events or fanfic \ud83d\ude05 I'm also ecstatic that everyone got their happy endings - I was so scared someone was gonna die",

I'm going to make a new post instead of add on to my old one because I want the comment count to increase LOL.\n\nYo, I knew Rang was going to level up when I saw that different opening credits picture. Two eyes instead of one became golden! How lovely! I teared up when he showed up to see Yeon off. It's nice that it was Rang's injury that forced Yeon to stay longer and then it was also Rang that sent his brother off by telling him that he's going to be okay after all. I'm also glad that (ex) Opium Yeon is building a relationship with Rang LOL. Finally, a formal meet and greet with the family and again about that great fox lineage haha! \n\nTo be honest, as far as Rang's plotline goes, I'm here for the character development. I probably care less about how it's done e.g., repairing family bonds vs romantic love. Although, it's nice to see Rang have different experiences. \n\nIt was in this episode that I finally found Moo Yeong's charm. He's so much better as the quietly confident and kind doctor. When he leaned down to smile at Hong Joo, I thought, \"wait, that's kind of sexy...\" lol! I loved how we got to see how the 1938 timeline wrapped up.\n\nThat ending too? They didn't address the original Mountain God after all. Damn, are we gonna have to wait another 3 years tho? Are we gonna meet a Baby Rang? Like literally? LOL. I feel like calling this a time travel doesn't quite make sense because there are consequences to time travel. It makes more sense to understand the events as occurring on a different plane or universe, in which there are multiple parallel universes that Yeon is traveling through.",

            "comment": "Oof this show was a solid 9/10 for me just bc of how well acted &amp; engaging it was.\n\nMy unpopular opinion though is that Rang might've done just fine without having a love interest introduced into the mix. I feel like they probably overcompensated to give Rang everything he didn't have in the last season (He mentioned he didn't have a first love to protect or family to return to so he had no will to live) BUT one thing that was alluring to me about Rang was that he was this misfit anti-hero type. Even after being abandoned by Yeon, he sort of took in Yuri, you can see he looks out for his bandits. It was sort of poetic how he had 'found family' even if he didn't realise it. It would have been fine to leave this character as the lone wolf type who doesn't aspire for romantic love. That being said once they established he liked Yeo hee, I was like pls let her live my man has suffered too many losses.\n\nYeon though - oof. He went so easy on the guy who literally STABBED his brother, and unleashed the Yaacha on so many innocent people, even putting Hong Joo in great danger at one point. Although when Moo Young 'died', I did sort of feel bad, I felt that was the right ending for him but then he survived with more or less no consequences for his actions.\n\nI love the way they set up S3; They left a lot of questions to be answered, but not a terrible cliffhanger which left us unsatisfied as to why we followed this drama. I saw Kim Bum's IGS saying he's done with the character but I hope that if there's a sequel, he'll be a recurring character because the soul of this show is essentially Yeon &amp; Rang's relationship despite what the writers try to push. Yeon's romance with Ji Ah? Bland. The 3 mountain god friends? Interesting enough, but nowhere as charismatic and engaging as seeing the 2 brothers interact. Please please get both Kim Bum &amp; Dong Wook if there is a S3!! Also doubt it'll be anytime soon though since Dong Wook mentioned on an interview (can't remember which) that he kinda wants to focus on playing humans for a while since he's played 2 really famous fantasy characters already\n\nLastly, let's just take a moment to appreciate the VISUALS of Dong Wook, Kim Bum &amp; Kim So-Yeon. They are some FINE FINE looking people",

LY going back 1938 for the guardian stone, was one of the missions from Taluipa. \n\nI don't think they will kill LR in season 2, as he is destined to die in 2020, as in season 1. My personal hope is that the future will change and retconn season 1, and LR is still alive when LY goes back to the future.",

I think Taluipa is going to let him off the hook and consider this as his (first and) final mission of the agreement and give him what he wants (that being Lee Rang).\n\nToo much has happened in 1938 that it's hard to believe these things are not going to have set off effects in the future. It's upsetting to think that only Lee Yeon and Shin Joo would have memories of these when they come back to the original timeline. So, yeah, I hope the future changes too.",

That show would be Tale of the White Tiger lololol. While both Moo Yeong and Rang were initially villains, I'd say that Rang got a lot more screen time for the audience to see his whole character in S1. To give credit to Kim Bum, he also crafted a character full of pathos and vulnerability while being terrifying at the same time. I'd like to believe that Ryu Kyung Soo would have been able to do the same if we were watching Tale of the White Tiger.",

Don't be mad at me, please.\n\nIf you recall, S1 Rang was initially a polarizing character for audiences. Just look at the timed comments on Viki calling him a toxic, violent, pathetic bro con lol. Although S1 Rang did get a redemption arc which Moo Yeong could've benefited from based on the comments in the thread. I think some wanted to see that too, but they checked out because there are fewer voices in that camp. I'm not sure if Ryu Kyung Soo's less screentime is about fame or seniority (I'm not denying it though), but the 12 episode format really limited any screen time from well established characters or the multiple plot lines. I guess you mean, they could've made time if they wanted to.  \n\nAs a satisfied Kim Bum fan, let me console you, dear: Yes, I also think Ryu Kyung Soo is definitely a decent actor that didn't get enough time to make his character shine! I look forward to his future leading roles, especially thoughtful melos where he can use that wistful lovey-dovey gaze. He looked so good in every scene with Hong Joo \ud83e\udd2d.",

She even saved Rang twice or thrice with her Siren powers.\n\nBut ever since episode 9 they turned her into a helpless woman hiding behind her man.\n\nTo quote that powerful speech by Reese Witherspoon, when in trouble women never say \"Oh what do we do now?\" \nYet that is exactly what they have turned her into.\n\nI hope she goes back to her powerful self in the Finale tomorrow.\n\n\nP.

He never bothered to reach out to his brother or explain his actions despite knowing Rang was just acting out because he felt betrayed by his brother. In this ep too, the thing that &gt;!motivates!&lt; him (the 1938 version of him) to &gt;!finally take action really is just that last line where Yeon says Ji Ah is there in the future!&lt;.\n\nLike at the end of the day, Yeon's only real motivation to act comes from finding/protecting Ji Ah first &amp; foremost and everything else after. Glad we got this S2 to sort of give him a redemption/growth arc and make him less selfish",

            "comment": "And we are finally done! I have soo many thoughts and to be frank the finale turned out better than I hoped, given that usually we are disappointed w finales. I am glad everyone is alive (like phew!) even moo yoeng (I know he did shit stuff, he was lost, angry, lala but is it jus me or he suddenly looked hot in the final ep?). \n\nI also however feel there were few storylines and arcs and they should have seriously stuck one, instead of a few half baked ones. Like the mercenaries boss was soo wasted, he seemed to have a lot of potential. Also, moo yoeng bringing back yeon and that plot should have been in more depth, like oh he got him and now we are having other fun at the side instead. I also dint really care or understand the point of the yatcha and having so many ppl killed for no reason. The original mountain god, yeh probably 3rd season then.\n\nOtherwise I think it was a great season compared to the first one. The bromance (I love love LR and LY even off-screen), friendships and chemistry. Everything was just better. And I jus knew yeon would ask the yeon in the era to come look after rang. It\u2019s so good to see the 3 mountain gods fighting together, love them that way. \nSpecial mention for Hong Joo being a badass and fighting even better than the men. Like hell yeah, go girl! And Rang finally believing in himself (seemed a little too sudden and taking cinematic liberties there), but oh hell Kim Bum jus keeps getting hotter and his final farewell was too sweet (I was expecting a saranghae but ok). \n\nLet\u2019s hope there is season 3 and most of the cast returns, fingers crossed. I hope the future does change. Wasn\u2019t too keen on seeing JiAh anyway, don\u2019t like her much. Haha",

Lee Dong-Wook is such a great actor. I also felt like crying when he was crying. I felt the emotions he felt at that moment. \n\n[This](https://imgur.com/a/UdOUV3k) was such a badass moment. I was hoping we'll get more.\n\nI wish we got to see more fight scenes with RHJ. She was such a badass fighting the three mercenaries all by herself. She is really the strongest mountain god. Based on the [preview](https://imgur.com/a/ljuwTcu) for the last episode, she'll have fight scenes so I'm looking forward to that. I just wonder where is RHJ in the future. I swear to God if she dies, I will lose it. I would love to see more of RHJ. I also love Kim So-Yeon. I hope she will be in the next season if there really is one. \n\nI guess we now know who will be the villain for the next season. But the question still remains. Who woke up CMY and brought him to the past? If it was the first mountain god, how was he able to do that without a body and his powers are scattered? \n\nThe relationship between the two brothers is really the highlight of this series. This is what got me hooked. I felt for LR. He might lose his only love and LY is going away soon. *Can't LY just bring LR to the future with JYH?* \n\nI'm so excited to see&gt;! Jo Bo-Ah next episode. I miss NJA.!&lt; But will LY really be able to come back to the present? &gt;!I saw somewhere that Season 3 has been confirmed and it's set in the Joseon Era.

For anyone who missed it, there is a cartoon post-credits scene which teased Season 3 set in the Joseon Era. It's is almost a confirmation that Season 3 will happen. But in case it doesn't, Season 2 were able to give everyone a happy ending although there are still a lot of questions left.\n\nIt was so great seeing &gt;!LR get a power up!&lt;. I guess all it takes is to believe in yourself in order to get some power up.\n\nWow. The CGI this season was top notch. It was so great to see LY in his full nine-tailed fox form.\n\nI'm so happy that &gt;!our precious Jindo didn't die!&lt;. I knew not to trust the preview. I also love how the gisaengs were learning how to fight. They're not just damsels in distress. I love empowered women.\n\nIs SEH really KYR? Since she healed and her wounds disappeared earlier, I'm guessing she really is. Maybe she got sent into Russia after the war?\n\nWhat the fortune god told LY was foreboding. LY could have used the favor against the first mountain god but of course &gt;!he has to save CMY!&lt;.\n\nI'm so happy to see &gt;!the three mountain gods fight against the invaders!&lt;. I knew they would team up together. Just like what LY stated, they are unbeatable if they work together.\n\nI guess the LY we would see in Season 3 is the LY from 1938. &gt;!If the three mountain gods were to return in Season 3, then they have to be the ones from 1938!&lt;. It's also a way for LR to return since he is still alive in 1938.\n\nOkay. I'm so confused. Did this show pulled a Marvel? I thought Taluipa stated that anything LY would have done in 1938 would be irrelevant since he is just a passerby. Everything would return to the status quo. However, we see LR together with his brother and girlfriend. We also see &gt;!the three mountain gods team up and fight together!&lt;. **How can this not affect the future?** I guess the timeline branched out? I don't know because if LR is happy with his brother and girlfriend then he would have not allied himself with Imoogi from Season 1 and everything would change. I'm really confused. That's why I'm just going to believe that LY and NJA has a perfect happy ending in the last episode and that we would be seeing a different timeline because it branched out. \n\nIf this is what happened, then it would alright to say that LY and NJA got their happy ending and LR would be reincarnated soon as we saw in Season 1. I think we would be seeing a different timeline in Season 3 where everything has changed. The first mountain god is still in 1938 and &gt;!Taluipa got her all-seeing eyes taken!&lt;. I'm guessing Season 3 might start right where Season 2 left off.",

His acting also felt weak here\n\n-Bruh how did taluipa got her eye taken away so easily like why does she not hv more security for such an important role and always seems a bit weak when convenient for plot?\n\n-How on earth was the boss of the mercenary gang taken out in less than 3mins that was anticlimactic given the buildup\n\n-It was dumb how Yeon didn\u2019t kill all the japanese mercenary demons in front of him when he had many chances. \n\n-Rang randomly gaining gumiho powers even tho in S1 he went thru a lot as well and had way more opps to bring out his inner potential\n\n-The governor general and so many Japanese top commanders got taken out by one gunwoman and they barely even fought back (they had a good shot on sunwoo a few times when she turned her back against them) and the entire hotel fight with main Japanese demon was meh\n\n-Also at the end i was expecting the original god to jump in the portal with yeon so he could fight for the treasure but it was a bit anticlimactic again if they wanted us to be excited for s3 ya know",

The claws reminded me of lee yeon's claws when he killed aheum imoogi, so im thinking it might be a fox too. Cant be his dad right, or taluipa and lee yeon would be mentioning about it when they were talking about the original mountain god. Also they reveal this now?? Guy has to find 3 more relics to restore his powers. Don't know how they will resolve that in one episode or they would just kill them off then and there. So just got me thinking they could extend this for one more season where the antagonist is this original mountain god. Would be a twist too if it's lee yeon's dad and we get the two brother's fighting against him!&lt;\nI liked the shinigami mercenaries too but &gt;!what the hell was that screen time for their boss. Lol they just killed him off, unless thats not the end of him. Probably!&lt; couple more hours and it's the finale! sad but exciting moment for totnt",

Thought it was added for the first season only to make the viewers feel somewhat sad during the juice lady ep, and there's no reason to add that line in Season 2 yet it was mentioned again, but maybe I'm remembering things wrongly lol!&lt;",

But as for Hong Joo I'm neutral towards her now. Like her character fall flat at the end. At least for me. \n\nAs for the mercenaries.. The boss just off like that? I mean they hype him to be this powerful and then just poof.. Defeated easily. I always love the brothers scenes. And this time it was heartbreaking. Please writer just give Rang a happy ending.\n\nI can't believe we're not going to have this discussion anymore next week. I'm going to miss this show\ud83d\ude22\n\nEdit: Watched episode 12 and now I felt empty. I'm going to miss this cast. I know there is season 3 but until that time I'm going to rewatch this series lol. Thoughts on the last episode - what's the point of hyping Shinigami leader? Dude really died the second time he appeared lol. Next Rang out of nowhere power up. That just make me raised my eyebrow.\n\n Lastly, I've got question. Does this mean Yeon created a parallel world with different outcomes? Because this definitely did not affect his future. Overall a great season even more so than S1.",

I won't lie, when I heard this was renewed for a second season, I was genuinely shocked and thought it was destined to fail. In the end, it's become one of the most enjoyable K-dramas of the year!\n\nIn our group chat, we've been talking about this one loads and there's some serious Angel vibes in the way this finale is put together. For those who watched Joss Whedon's spin-off, the final episode has so many moments that feel reminiscent of how season 5's finale played out. Angel and Connor finally fighting together, the shocking death &gt;!of Wesley!&lt; which is kinda similar to &gt;!Jae-yoo except, y'know, no follow through!&lt;, the heart-wrenching goodbyes, the surprise returns like &gt;!Moo-yeong popping up and kicking ass!&lt; and a big fight between two sides that &gt;!ends on a cliffhanger!&lt;. I hope we get a third season s this one's been a huge improvement over season 1.",

            "comment": "I enjoyed the finale, it seemed a satisfying ending for everyone. I just wished we got a finale scene of Shin Ju and Yuri reuniting in the modern day.\n\nHowever I don't understand how season 3 would work logistically? Would it be the past or present?\n\nKim Beom has put an IG story basically saying goodbye to his character. So it doesn't seem like he will be back \n\nAs the revived 1st mountain god is in 1938, how would that plotline involve modern day Lee Yeon? It's not like Jo Bo Ah is coming back, so how would they write her out again if it was set in modern day? Alternatively it could be set in the past but that would mean the modern day Lee Yeon won't be in it. Would it be a spin off about the 3 mountain gods?\n\nSide question: I'm still confused as to whether 1938 was the actual 1938 that Lee Yeon lived through to get to the modern day or if it was an alternate one? Because at the beginning of ep12 when he is writing the letter to his 1938 version, it sounds like he's talking about 1938 as if he doesn't remember living through it? Like he is only just realising 1938 LY was an opium addict?\n\nTo add to that, where is Hong Ju in modern day?\n\nEdit: added questions.",

            "comment": "I feel like most of what I've wanted to say I said in last week's thread - I love Mooyoung as a character (his little smiles are to die for) and he's been done dirty by the writing, Yeohee is stuck in \"Rang's loveline\" territory where half the audience won't even use her name, etc. So I'll just share these two things;\n\n1. I'm surprised I've seen no one talking about the obvious parallels / foreshadowing for last episode's scene where Rang was talking about how Yeohee was his first love and only love, and then the scene switched to Mooyoung and Hongjoo talking about how first loves always go wrong. Also surprised I haven't seen anyone talk about how Jiah in S1 literally talked about the story of the mermaid and how she initially didn't understand why the mermaid would sacrifice herself for her love, but eventually came to understand it once she met Yeon. These could both be foreshadowing something awful happening to the relationship, or introducing interesting parallels between a tragedy and a love story. Or it could be nothing bcs the writers did it by accident lmao. ~~There's also the parallels between Mooyoung and his brother and Rang and Yeon, but we won't get into that now~~\n2. &gt;!Satori!&lt; deserved so much better. Holy fuck &gt;!he!&lt; had the opportunity to be a great character (and WAS a great character) but we learned so fucking little and got to see so little of them. &gt;!He's adept at disguising himself - not only were his mannerisms and personality different when he was pretending to be the assistant, but his voice was pitched higher too. He's incredibly skilled and incredibly powerful and arrogant bcs of it, and that ultimately is his downfall, like so many others. It's great. If he'd just 1, 2, 3'd immediately instead of going \"WHAT'S GOING ON\" he could have gotten Yeon to stop them lol! I assume he's probably still alive if the others are, but...!&lt;\n\nI really wish they'd told us what specific demon the boss is tho - we know everyone except for them and Ryuhei (and Akira, I guess? I can't remember if Akira is non-human LOL).  \nEDIT: I will eat my own words, I was curious and &gt;!Satori!&lt; is literally just the name of the demon itself. They're &gt;!\"mind-reading monkey-like monsters\"!&lt; from Japanese folklore. Also interesting is that some people think they're the &gt;!child incarnations of mountain gods who have \"come to ruin\" and turned into demons. Also interesting, bcs it harkens back to the scenes with the other sidekicks, it says \"if something unexpectedly strikes them, they become stricken with fear and run away\". Kind of reminds me of the character he played with the yacha - maybe more realistic than even he'd like to admit?!&lt;\n\nBonus: Yuki is such a little gremlin and I love her. Jaeyoo crying was such a good decision on the writer's part. Love the scenes with the side characters &lt;3 Taluipa had some great scenes this time too. If &gt;!Jaeyoo or Yeohee dies!&lt; I will be very upset &lt;33\n\nAlso, maybe my memory is faulty, but do we know who the fourth mountain god is? Taluipa said before there was four there was one and I cannot for the life of me remember the fourth lmao.",

            "comment": "I like this drama. I really do. Park Hyung Sik was born to play Joseon royalty; he emotes so well and he has great chemistry with Jeon So Nee. But it has a huge pacing problem.\n\nWe're in the second half and besides last week's cliffhanger reveal, there's been little to no progress on the plot -- or the romance. And I get it, the latter is a slow burn and it's clear the leads are getting there, but they're getting there so very, very slowly and in such boring ways because far too much screen time is wasted on tomfoolery from Ga Ram and Myeong Jin. At this point, I'd pay money for more political scheming if only to inject some urgency into the plot.\n\nI think OBY would've benefited from a \"case of the week\" format in which the Prince enlists MJY/GSD's help to investigate unusual cases that appear to be supernatural, but are not. These mini cases should then have tied to the larger mystery of the Prince's \"curse,\" which is an interesting conundrum because there's clearly a psychosomatic element (in that the Prince *believes* the curse is real and therefore his body is reinforcing it by freezing up on him).\n\nWhile investigating the former, you have ample opportunities for the Prince and GSD to grow closer while gaining appreciation of the other's social status and skills. They're both quite clever and it would've been far more interesting to pair them off as a Sherlock Holmes/James Watson duo with both trying to solve the cases for bragging rights. Maybe the show could've opened with the Four Cardinal Points case. Then Hwan \"catches\" MJY (in disguise as a man) snooping around. He knows she's a woman but treats her as an equal. Then her family is murdered and when she comes to him for help, they team up for some buddy-comedy hilarity. As a B-plot, back at the palace, the Prince must contend with Ministers (and the Queen) not only constantly petitioning the king to limit his power and and freedom, but also plotting his removal and banishment on the grounds that he murdered his older brother. Then this plot would culminate in a house arrest for Hwan and then a trial that requires him to 100% trust GSD (who at this point, he's madly in love with lol) to save him.\n\nOf course, I'm grasping for straws here. Maybe the show will pick up (I sure hope so) but so far, I'm a wee bit disappointed. :(",

                    "comment": "That's exactly how I feel and today's episode (Ep 9) felt a bit like a case per episode situation. I don't mind the Ga-ram/Myeong-jin interactions as they're slowly falling for each other also and they're kind of goofy cute.\n\nIt's clear that CP and Jae-yi are also bonding beyond friendship just by how wide her smiles are getting. He hasn't melted yet, but he's getting close. And then he'll be worried about betraying his friend and that \"wedding letter\" will need to be burned. \n\nI have watched a lot of gender-bending sageuks because they usually allow women to do things that would be otherwise forbidden (like reading or speaking their mind...\ud83e\udd7a) and the FLs tend to be bad ass. But there's always this hidden homoerotic build-up that is not always handled well. Here at least the ML is in on the disguise from the beginning which is refreshing as he's trying to protect her, but also in awe of her coolness. The only annoying thing is how unlikely it is that these gorgeous tiny women are not found out. It would be easier for a lot of the male actors to pass as women if they weren't so tall (which was a running joke in Nokdu).",

            "comment": "*my thoughts following episodes 9 and 10*\n\njust yesterday, i was contemplating how this drama might end in light of the fact that it\u2019s very difficult to picture jae yi as a crown princess. there is a version of her that arguably fits the role, but she is certainly not someone who would be content confined within the walls of the palace, and to a position that would offer her barely any freedom at all. marriage to yi hwan would be the antithesis of what she wants from her life; as she told him herself in episode 10, she desires the freedom to choose, to play an active part in saving people\u2019s lives, to feel that she can do anything she sets her mind to, and to be recognised for her talents. \n\nher characterisation makes it almost impossible to predict how this drama might end. on the surface, we\u2019re presented with a classic love triangle, but it seems to me that whatever conclusion we\u2019re given won\u2019t follow the conventions of this set up. or it will, and the drama\u2019s ending will not be too dissimilar to that of the red sleeve (no spoilers but hopefully it\u2019s clear as to why i make the comparison). \n\nwhat strikes me about yi hwan though is that he does not wish to possess jae yi, quite the opposite. prior to their episode 10 conversation/meal, he was determined to put aside his own feelings and ensure she was reunited with his friend. on learning that this reunion and the ensuing marriage is not what jae yi would choose, and that she would rather remain by his side as a head eunuch, yi hwan\u2019s ultimate goal in regard to jae yi changes, but his attitude toward her remains the same; jae yi continues to be told \u201cyes you can. do it. try it\u201d. \n\njae yi is liberated but only so long as she continues to be perceived as a man. if and when the truth is made known beyond her closest circle, society at large will argue that the freedoms afforded to her (to uncover the truth, roam free, wield a weapon, and protect the lives of others), as well as her position by the crown prince\u2019s side (as friend, ally, investigative partner, and bringer of joy), are unacceptable. \n\nwe\u2019re at the half way mark now, and while the case(s) being investigated becomes increasingly complex, the future of each of the leads seems less and less certain. each occupies a precarious position where what they want from life \u2014 that which brings them happiness \u2014 could so easily be withheld from them by external powers, both individual and societal. i\u2019m reminded of the title, our blooming youth, and how beneath the intrigue and politics is a coming of age story, or stor*ies*. \n\nthere are two final things i wanted to comment on. firstly, the scene at the end of episode 9, the revival of a friendship, was truly moving; everything that came before it lead perfectly to that moment and reinforced \u201ctrust\u201d as both an overarching theme of this drama and key to the lives of its central characters. the second and final thing i will comment on is the instrumental score, which really stood out for me the past two episodes. perhaps this was because of its similarity at particular moments to modern crime dramas/thrillers. at other moments, the string instruments made for something very grand and emotive in nature. i am a fan. and look forward to seeing where the music, story, and characters take us next.",

The writer has had her struggles with tone and consistently tying together the plot threads in an engaging way, but I continue to enjoy how she uses Jaeyi to comment on Joseon society\u2019s misogyny. How will she resolve this and give our Jaeyi a happy ending that satisfies our modern desire to give her the freedom and agency she deserves? I\u2019m so curious to find out.   \n\n\nAlso, they conversation was just fun to watch, Jaeyi kept saying new things to shock Hwan, who was intermittently exasperated and amused by her. And like you said, he definitely has no desire to possess and stifle her, so what will become of this love story? Not to mention, Hwan\u2018s very honorable so he likely will feel forever duty bound to deny his feelings for Jaeyi even if she doesn\u2019t want to marry Sung On\u2026 all this to say, the slow burn of this romance is really ramping up for me and I\u2019m looking forward to the angst.",

            "comment": "I started this drama this week and am really enjoying it. None of the characters or plot elements are particularly original, but the performances are consistently good and the mystery elements, both the cases and the political conspiracies, are very solid. I really like the pacing, which doesn't drag, and I think the flashback device has been used particularly well to provide context without belaboring the point, which isn't always the case in saeguks.\n\nThe tonal shifts can be a little jarring (light/funny scenes sometimes come a split second after an intense, semi-spooky moment). Generally speaking, I think the drama is stronger when it leans into the \"heavy\" material. The semi-supernatural aspects of the plot, the background of the mysterious rebellion, and the high stakes of the court intrigue help give the drama some flavor and uniqueness. With that said, the banter between the leads is a lot of fun; it just isn't always inserted at the right junctures.\n\nAlso, have to say that the palace sets are superb. I also like the effort that goes into portraying the capital city - even the CGI used to show the extent of the city is better than in most similar dramas, where it looks like a small rural town centered on the palace.",

I like that we get some time to get to know the characters and their dynamics as well as getting a feel for the \"world\" and initial situation we find ourselves in. I saw some people complain about it so maybe more or less binging it in the last couple days has helped with that but I generally don't have a problem with a show taking its time for the setup as long as the rest doesn't suffer from it down the line. I guess we will have to see how it turns out but for now I'm hooked and thoroughly enjoying it.",

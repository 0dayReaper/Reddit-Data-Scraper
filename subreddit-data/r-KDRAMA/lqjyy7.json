Cheolbong, especially Sobong (NOT So Yong) were hard carrying this show. \n\nThe writers really messed up",

They had finished filming and the main actress and actor fell in love during the process and were together by the end. Pretty odd ending if I do say so myself but I guess it's a way of saying love is transcendent? \n\nEdit: grammar",

Definitely some homophobic undertones there when they so abruptly try to appease with heteronormativity. They pulled that same heteronormative sh* at the end of Thai BL called Tonhon Chonlatee. It made no sense to suddenly go \"let's reward your trash-human father (transphobic, homophobic, sexist, sees female purpose as nothing but producing a child and those who don't have wombs aren't women either, etc.) by having your friend be your surrogate!\" That's seriously all it took for the dad to accept the gay couple - a surrogate child (he even treated his own daughter as a disappointing baby factory bc A) she and her husband hadn't had success yet B) she doesn't have family name). So here they are (gay couple &amp; surrogate friend -also, the friend didn't volunteer, the parents were just like, \"ofc she'll say yes &amp; she's perfect b/c she's still a *virgin*), expecting a child WHILE THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL STILL IN COLLEGE. NOW, THEY'RE JUST GONNA RAISE THE BABY AS 3 PARENTS?! The dad couldn't have waited until the kids had a stable life yrs post-graduation? WT*?!. It was impractical and just stupid. Made me so mad.",

I think the problem the writers had is that if Bong Hwan was left permanently as So Young, what happens to him in his real life? Does he die with the world thinking he's a bad man? And while we see that Sobong loves Cheoljeong, Bong Hwan has other people who love him in his real life, because he mentions his mother a few times in the show. And if Bong Hwan permanently replaces So Young, that makes So Young's ending a sad one too. She ceases to exist, despite doing absolutely nothing wrong. !&lt;",

We are never shown So Yong in the narrative besides flashbacks and when she finally does replace Bong Hwan in the last episode, she is still So Yong, not Bong Hwan with his crazy plans, modern ideas, and unwavering determination. It doesn't matter if she suddenly lifts up her skirts when she walks or curses; that just means Bong Hwan's mannerisms influenced her, it doesn't mean she actually has him inside of her. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!So Yong died. She gave up on life and the one who fought for a chance in that life was Bong Hwan, not her. Her taking the ending feels cheep, hollow, and undeserved. If they had shown BOTH souls working together early on, maybe it would have worked. But they didn't. And by the end, we have Cheoljong wondering what he has lost...what is missing....clearly indicating that Bong Hwan is gone. For good. So Yong's ending is already a sad one in the drama ending: she is living her life as a lie.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I would have much preferred the chinese novel ending where the guy stays in the princess' body and the princess switches to the guy's body in modern times and has fun there. In the novel, a minor god had made a mistake and switched their souls upon birth so it was really just returning them to their rightful places and not BL which some users seem to be terrified about. !&lt;\n\nAll in all, very disappointing.",

Not to mention that they were also nonplussed by the fact that their relationship to the queen had gone from being regarded as family back to a  servant/master status quo.!&lt;",

It's like after all the jokes were spent and the plot reached the climax, the writers were left scratching their heads and trying to think of ways to fill out the spaces in between.",

If, however, you felt like you just wasted eight years of your life and been stabbed in the back by people you trusted to deliver what they promised, I'd maybe take a hard pass. !&lt;",

I'll post a link to where I lay it out as it's a bit long: [https://liesfallaciesfabrications.tumblr.com/](https://liesfallaciesfabrications.tumblr.com/)\n\nBut am I okay with it? Let's see...it's been almost two weeks now, and I'm reading alternate fan fiction while drinking wine and listening to to How Can I Love the Heartbreak...you tell me. LOL Seriously though, this could have been my all-time favorite K-drama ever if they didn't choose to go the route they did.",

I don't want to spoil anything for them, but at the same time I'm so tempted to leave an encouraging message and let them that I will be there for them when once they hit that finale. LOL",

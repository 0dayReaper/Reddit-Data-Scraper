I have to say the actor who plays YHJ is good especially with the humorous scenes, he sells it well.!&lt;\n\nFor someone who doesn't like politics, its always Kim Sabu who sees the better picture in certain situations. &gt;!With Kang Dong Ju returning and all those scenes about meeting the KTPB(?)/criteria, I now see why Cha Jin Man was his plan B!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I think he knows that their usual orderless approach wouldn't work on the Trauma Center, at least for now. They need  that funding approval but he knew that it wouldn't be easy and the assemblywoman revealing her intentions doubled down on that. They need to meet the metrics as proof that theyre doing good on treating trauma patients. And for that, he needed someone different from him, someone that can enforce rules. But unfortunately, things didn't work out with Cha Jinman unless they plan to have him back at the end of the season be Center head again. And I'm surprised Park Mingguk doesnt see this.!&lt;\n\nI agree with KDJ on that argument with SWJ. they shouldn't be reckless just because \"Master Kim taught them to do it\" and I'm glad someone said it to Seo Woo Jin. Dude has been reckless throughout the season that I thought this show became about him and his reckless adventures.\n\nAnd tbh, I dont understand SWJ's hostility towards KDJ. Were their encounters during Med school that bad or he's feeling uneasy as another student of Kim Sabu that he didnt know showed up or a mix of both. But at least he acknowledges KDJ's skills.",

Eunjae was saying something \"does he not remember what happened?\" and it was mentioned that Woojin and Dongjoo used to fight in residency too. \n\nI don't know how other people feel, but I think I'm in Dongjoo's camp here. All this time people have been striving to be Kim Sabu, but he's one of a kind and people should strive to be more than him, but still be themselves. I can totally see this being the final stretch of character development for Eunjae and Woojin.  I can also see this as a mini arc for Kim Sabu to learn to ease up and trust someone else too!",

Looking back, imo S2 plot armor was too strong that woojin and eunjae reckless behaviour kinda has no consequences which of course came back to bit them this season, and the political woman kid that pass away due to overlooking and negligence",

Don't hurry after him, trying to keep up with his pace.\"!&lt; but isn't that the harsh cold truth? I think up until Woo Jin's hand incident, it was back-to-back crisis for him and his life was at risk in almost every single episode. We all shared our sentiments regarding that. Now that things were slowing down for him, Dong Joo makes sure to keep him in place by adding \"you might lose something else and not just your hand next time.\" I can't wait to see how this DJ vs WJ thing is going to unfold. It was hard to read Kim Sabu's expression when he overheard DJ. Was he disappointed? Was he also faced with a jarring reality of putting too much pressure on WJ to follow after his footsteps? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love the Eun Tak and Areum tidbits in today's episode! Dr Dong coming clean about his feelings for Areum to Eun Tak, but also revealing that he's actually rooting for them after realizing that Areum's feelings for Eun Tak was basically unbreakable. THE ANSWER IS FLOWERS! Please just listen to Dong Hwa and give her the damn flowers. Don't let it rot away in your locker before it's too late- again! Loved how it didn't end there and the epilogue happened. I love the fact that Eun Tak was sharing his thoughts and confusion towards Areum with his male coworkers. He seems like he keeps those things to himself, so I enjoyed seeing this side of him.  It's so funny how the male and female reactions are so different too",

            "comment": "**EPISODE 13:** *Kang Dong Ju!*\n\n*A little of S1 talks-* \n\nHonestly I wasn't the biggest fan of KDJ in s1 and only because he took literally the entire season to decide where he wanted to be - I mean he was sure that Kim Sabu is it but he kept thinking and searching for the right answer. I wanted to watch more of a partnership between Kim Sabu and KDJ given that he was searching for this doctor who had handled him during his outrage at the hospital in the past. However - I also do understood that he was a man of his principals and with Kim Sabu those were being questioned regularly and hence his reaction. So for me KDJ really shines in this season. He is enforcing rules yet making sure each patient is attended too. \n\n*Moving to the episode-*\n\nI loved every moment of KDJ taking charge - he was understanding, checking and then concluding. Loved the way he is being the head of the trauma centre. \n\nI think KDJ was right in &gt;!scolding Eun-Jae, because she didn't even report this to Kim Sabu - the head of the Doldam hospital. I mean I understand the urgency of the situation but you cannot not report to the head of the hospital about the case and its emergency. I understand you weren't busy and it was an emergency and honestly I'm not against her doing that operation but atleast report the case. Although I do think KDJ should have scolded her after the operation. But KDJ was right in scolding her.!&lt;\n\nKDJ's entire stance on &gt;!inspiring to be Kim Sabu is right - Only Kim Sabu can be Kim Sabu rest of can learn from him but cannot be him without costing yourself. I mean I think they will show KDJ being fast in operating and other stuff that he himself willed to learn from Kim Sabu but he also has maintained certain rules for himself. Which is the ideal balance. !&lt;\n\nHowever having said that and having a softer corner for both Woo-Jin and Kim Sabu I want Woo-Jin to find &gt;!his own balance in being Dr. Romantic and yet not be reckless with himself. !&lt;\n\nBecause for Woo-Jin, Kim Sabu is his family and he is very protective of him as well as Woo-Jin firmly believes in the doctor self too he encourages to believe in his instinct and his patients so their is a mixture and he just needs to find his own stable point. \n\n&gt;!That moment where Woo-Jin hides his injured hand from Kim Sabu - trying not to make Kim Sabu guilty about it - Oh the moment had me \ud83d\ude2d They are such father - son from being playful with each other and to this. I really love Woo-Jin and Kim Sabu together. !&lt;\n\nI loved how Insu met KDJ \ud83e\udd2d honestly Insu has been my favourite for all 3 seasons but this one he is really shining in both serious and comic ways. I really hope to see more of the actor who plays Insu- really love his acting even in EAW he had a minor role but I loved him even for those few minutes. \n\nagain, I LOVED KDJ in action and the way Woo-Jin made that entry - and the pair working together. I genuinely wanna see how they unfold together because I am guessing we'll need the 3 best together to win this war!",

I'm confused why everyone was taken back when dongjoo said that they will only treat trauma patients and non-trauma patients will go doldam? isn't that the whole reason why the trauma center was built in the first place? the trauma center and doldam's er are two completely different places with different functions. \n\nthe talk he had with seo woojin was much needed and was a wake-up call. don't try to be the next master kim, because you will never be him. he's a once in a century type of doctor. dongjoo's right, woojin might even lose something else and not just his hand next time. i really like this quote said by kdj, \"you might represent what our approach should be, but you cannot be our goal.\" \n\nI think amongst the doldam staff (including seojung and inbeom), dongjoo's the odd one out because he's the only realistic doctor amongst idealistic doctors.",

The episodes are much more fun now but there are only 2 episodes left .\n\nEdit - The writers have completely butchered  CEJ's character , she would never do this boycott thing and also make her cry all the time .

As the others have said, he really brought a wake-up call to the trauma centre and doldam hospital. \n\nThe whole boycott thing was frustrating to watch. I understand that the sudden changes dongju enforced may have been a bit overwhleming for the staff to follow and that they felt they were being bossed around. I agree with some who pointed out that dongju could have communicated more clearly with staff about his intentions instead of just ordering them about. I also think the staff could have talked with dongju to say their stand. This would have all been solved earlier if they just communicated. Instead, we had that useless doctor convince everyone into boycotting dongju which will do more harm cause they left a trauma centre empty. What's frustrating about all this is that the useless doctor's motivation about the boycott is mostly fueled by his inferiority to dongju. He can't accept that he's receiving orders from a junior and basically he won't accept him so he won't even consider talking to dongju or that he might listen. Even woojin gave a comment that they can just talk with dongju. It was so frustrating to hear him whine about not taking orders from dongju when he isn't shown to be doing anything aside from gossiping and eating sandwiches. \n\nI was also surprised eunjae joined the boycott but I guess it was pretty in line with her character. She tends to act rashly at first but eventually realizes why she's wrong. I was glad to see her mind changing towards the end. \n\nLast two episodes. I do think they should have brought dongju sooner. Curious to see how they'll wrap up the series.",

I honestly wish this character growth/struggle for the EJ and WJ happened earlier in the series so we could fully see that development unfold. I think deep down, especially after the building incident, Master Sabu wants to teach EJ/WJ not to adopt the \"save lives at all cost\" mentality but he is unable to. Bringing KDJ in allows for a senior to teach them that they got to set emotions aside and follow the fundamental rules of being a doctor.\n\nMy favourite scene in ep 13 was when Master Sabu decided not to call KDJ despite the chaos. In his eyes, I saw him handing over his \"scalpel\" to his successor. Amidst his worries, he has full confidence that KDJ will bring his trauma center dream (from season 1) to life. Realistically speaking, he also seems to accept that one day, he will have to retire and the staff at Doldam/Trauma center will have to operate without his constant presence.  His choice not to get involved is part of his eventual exit plan.\n\nAs a teacher, Master Sabu's gentle approach is absolutely admirable.",

I cried so hard with her when she went back to the ER room and cried. Areum and Eun Tak was my favorite couple, but I'm starting to feel like Eun Tak doesn't deserve her at all. He's willing to fight anyone that messes with Areum but not WITH her for their relationship.",

There isn\u2019t enough screen time for everyone who are key roles in this story. It was not balance and it was a bravado for many times on SWJ. What I like in season 1 and 2 is the old hospital vibes and human emotions intact and been portrayed well. Is it the same writer even? I think KDJ appearance is the only wow factor and up the game of this season though it is a bit too late in my opinion cos we only have 2 eps left. I feel they didn\u2019t do EJ character a justice and rushed her to something she is not. \n\nThere is many things to rant about and I felt with the budget they would have it would have been executed better.

            "comment": "When KSB was talking to CEJ regarding the boycott, I was waiting for him to ask her: Why didn't you inform me about the patient? \n\nThat was the ONLY instruction KDJ gave CEJ regarding that patient. It is not he didn't think that patient was not an emergency case. Remember he is a Doldam hospital patient, and Doldam is KSB in-charge. CEJ is a Trauma Center doctor, which KDJ is in-charge of. Isn't it basic courtesy of you to inform the I/C of their patient and let him decide the next move? Besides, maybe KSB will really ask KDJ to let. CEJ help, then there will not be this conflict. And why is CEJ confronting KDJ in the hospital lobby? Challenging his authority in front of everyone. KDJ would never allow her to undermine his authority in front of the staff. And what nonsense was she sprouting about her being the only CS? Is she holding the TC hostage then? That the entire TC will not  be able to function properly without her? All her good efforts have been sadly tarnished with that challenge. The writers really screwed up her character this season. \n\nI'm glad that the *almighty* SWJ did not go along with her antics and even tried to talk her out of the boycott. Someone in their relationship has to be the smart and objective one rite? \n\nHonestly, KSB has to take responsibility for what has happened as well. Dir Park says that KSB is perceived as giving KDJ *unconditional belief and full support*. Honestly can we blame him? The first gen staff knows KDJ, the gen 2 don't. So you cannot expect them to believe and trust KDJ wholeheartedly. He is NOT WRONG in diverting non-trauma cases to Doldam, that is the SOP. But even the first gen staff have their reservations over this, let alone the gen 2. And suddenly during the confrontation with CEJ, he says outright that he has built new teams to come into the TC. If you are a staff there, won't you feel threatened? Again, KDJ is NOT WRONG, as the head of the TC, he has all the right and authority to bring in new staff, esp when obvs the whole TC cannot function with just 1 CS, right? But the communication is sorely lacking, esp when all the staff are such a tight and close-knit family. Such methods from KDJ will not be easily accepted by the team. And KSB is expecting the team to trust him (KSB) and also listen and follow KDJ because he has his plan. Again, not everyone knows KDJ as well as KSB does, so such blind allegiance is difficult to achieve. IMO, KSB is taking the team's respect for him for granted. \n\nThe TC is KSB's dream, so he has an important say in it. But, a lot of people are involved in making the TC happen. CEJ is an example. While it wrong of her to think she is indispensable just because she is the only CS, but she is one of the pioneer figures of the TC. Naturally she wants the TC to do well and to hear KDJ making changes and decisions like that unilaterally definitely rubs a lot of ppl the wrong way. And Dir Park has always supported KSB and is running all over the place to secure funding. At least he was involved in getting CJM in. But now KSB wants him to be patient and trust KDJ.. \n\nAt this point, I really don't care anymore that JDH is related to KSB's first student. This relationship should be developed earlier. Right now there are other more important plotlines to explore. \n\nPET and YAR.. Oh my heart! I was rooting for them, but PET... You can be so passionate over your deceased best friend, KSB and SWJ. You are even perceptive enough to calm CEJ during the surgery, but you cannot sense your gf needs you to show some affection?",

You can see how both Eun Jae and Woo Jin became confident in their skills and autonomy to make spontaneus decisions, thus ignoring the rules and the system, professor Park and Dong Joo value so much.\n\nThe trauma center can\u2018t operate in the way Doldam does. I think they are mistaken the trauma center as an extension of Doldam, while in reality it is an independent institution where different rules apply. Just because they learned not to follow the rules doesn\u2018t mean that it is the wrong thing to do so.\n\nIt is interesting to see the differences between Dong Joo and Woo Jin. Dong Joo intends to pursue independence from Master Kim by proving himself competent, not needing his teacher to intervene and thus, relying on him. Whereas Woo Jin embraces his dependence on his teacher maybe without even realizing it.\n\nIt is totally correct by Dong Joo to imply that each of his students has to pursue their own paths. They can learn from his methods, but their decisions must not be the answer to \u201cwhat would Master Kim have done in this situation?\u201c but rather \u201cwhat do I think is the correct approach?\u201c\n\nMaster Kim is the ideal. Every ideal is a judge. Setting him as your goal will inevitably lead to failure because he might be one of the best doctors to have ever existed and to ever arise.",

YSJ was also in San Diego so it would make sense that her and KDJ could\u2019ve been working together this whole time. the director of this drama, Director Yoo, also mentioned that we would be seeing two old faces for sure return, one of whom is of course, KDJ. the second person, however, is up in the air and I think it very well could be YSJ. thoughts?",

I'm really glad master kim talked eunjae out of it.\n\nwhen kim sabu was reviewing the list of people dongjoo wanted to bring over, was seojung on there? i hope she is, he had this little grin. and i want to believe this bc he said he will bring in a CS if eunjae leaves, and seojung is a CS.\n\nthrough the convo between dongjoo and woojin, i noticed that the latter was always, \"that's not what master kim taught you\" or \"master kim didn't do this or that\". they are two different people!\n\na forest fire that could possibly destroy doldam? oh gosh. it could've been prevented if it wasn't for the boycott. though, i hope this is an opportunity for seojung and inbeom to make a comeback.\n\none last thing, I think all of these issues/tensions should've been in the earlier episodes. i feel like the final week, everything's supposed to be wrapped up, but it feels like things are only starting to unfold.",

Is that even necessary? Why can\u2019t he just make his point across at that point and tell her to finish up quickly then come over and do her day job? Then when all these is over conduct a meeting with everyone and shout at everyone then? SWJ knows CEJ would get affected hence he stepped in and took over the call.

Woojin and Eunjae were so reckless that they are willing to break the rules but the aftermath is that, either they hurt themselves or other patients or the system. And the one who suffers a lot is Kim Sabu. Dr. Kang wants to avoid that burden to Kim Sabu. The reset couple should understand accountability on their actions. While the greatest mantra of a Doctor is to save lives, saving lives requires an optimum efficiency of experience and skills while maintaining the rules of the medical system. Kim Sabu has the highest efficiency and experience of saving lives, while the reset couple hence their skills and talent can also perform well but has the downside of being reckless and no sense of accountability. Dr. Kang Dong Ju wanted to make that a point of view to those Doctors. They cannot at all times be like Kim Sabu. It really requires a high level of efficiency and experience being a Surgeon.\"",

            "comment": "Honestly, finally I am feeling like I am watching RDTK. It bring the perfect amount of drama and tension that was missing in first 1-8 episodes. Feel like they dragged it more than it's necessary and in that process they compromise important character's screen space. Now it's all the mess. How they going to tie up all the loose end in only 2 episode. Are they making base for season 4? Season 1 Vs Season 2 and 3?\n\nThe break up between euntak and areum looked so misfit in all the current mess. I wanted to see them addressing the issue. I understand both euntak and areum and I agree with their break up but timing is not correct. This should have been handle in before episode only.\n\nNow they are inserting Dong-hwa and Kim Sabu's first student connection too at this time of mess. I did felt both were connected before but why didn't they bring this few episode back and shot it then, so we will be getting 2 min instant noodles kind of treatment with this track too?\n\nWhy eunjae is acting like a brat all of sudden? I mean I did understand she felt wronged and dong ju was very much wrong for not explaining it to her. She was wrong to leave her post without informing. I know she was treating the patient but Doldam hospital is another organization.  She put her patient center at risk to treat another hospital's patient. Which is against the rule. But I don't fault her that's how she learned from Kim Sabu. Which saved many patient and doctor's goal should be saving them but boycott was way too childish and immature. She said trauma center is her dream so why she isn't seeing her behaving like a child will cost them her and their dream? They are understaff and need more, They are already loose patient cause they didn't have enough doctors and now his mom is attacking them from all the means so why she is raising the issue on hiring more of doctors. Does she want only one CS in trauma center?  I am okay with immaturity and stubbornness that's how they learn and became better and grow as a doctor but again they miss the timing . How will they even going to show all the character development in just 2 episode?\n\nNow coming to Dong ju. He is same as ever egoistic, stubborn, intelligent a student who wants to go ahead of his teacher. He has same goal as Kim sabu but his method is different. That's what is needed to run trauma center. Even Kim Sabu knows, with his methods can't run truma center and needs someone like dong ju or Cha Jin-man. Who follows the rule. Cha Jin man failed because he was too one sided. He cares about his doctors and doctors pride which is good thing but not patient. But doctor's main goal should be patient. He moment he chose law suit over the patient from the disaster he loose all the respect as a doctor for me at least.  While Dong Ju will follow the rule but give priority to his patients. He have same goal as Kim sabu but his method is totally different. The writer has done excellent job with his character and to only his character lol. Having said that I agree with Kim Sabu he need to be leader not boss. He shouldn't boss around without explaining them why. But does he has time for it? He is not here as their mentor but as the head of trump center who need to run the organization.  But also his staff will not magically understand why he took certain decision without them knowing the reason. They will think he is trying to replace them when in reality he is just trying to hirer more as they are understaff.  If this happened few episode back they could have show us how he becomes leader from boss. But again just 2 episode.",

I feel as though there are way too many details in the show that have not been addressed in depth, and I\u2019m not sure how this will all be tied up in Ep. 15-16 unless there is a Season 4. I understand that the writers wanted DRTK to be on a larger scale and they certainly brought in large scale situations, but not sure how they will be able to wrap up a show that has so many complex issues going on in the background",

However, the execution wasn't great because of time constraints in the flow of the season 3. If Dongju entered in the story in the earlier episodes and place time skip on CJM's leadership, there would have been better room (and not a shortcut route) to show why a \"boycott\" happened. At some point some scenes related to Dongju's clash with Eunjae is alluding to his conflicts with Master Kim back in season 1 (gosh is writer-nm more motivated to write about Dongju LOL)",

Unlikely.\n\nThat said, seriously - Striking without notice, or refusing to work/insubordination, is strong grounds for suspension/termination.  In real life situations, admin and/or staff should have prepared for contingencies in view of their strike.\n\nThe writer bit off more than they could chew with this story arc.

Like i get there's probably a more personal incentive regarding what happened during their residency but &gt;! kim sabu was right how do you not remember your own boyfriend's whistleblower incident? enough to almost endanger your patients? keeping your patients hostage is so not the way to go through this. Ofc next episode when they actually have patients she isn't going to not treat them and she's getting around already, but there are better ways to handle it !&lt;\n\nhonestly one of the most important things I'm excited about is Jang Dong-Hwa !!! For him to want to know more Kim sabu just made sense. He was getting accumulated into the hospital and finally has been shown to pull his weight and get along with everyone. Everyone likes character development lol. And it was obvious he knew someone who worked at doldam before, or someone who worked with him before. To think it was &gt;!

Furthermore going about this by participating in a boycott was ridiculous. Who knew Ho-jun could be this influential. \n\nOn the other hand, Dong-ju's clearly planning for the long run but he's not taking his staff into confidence. He mentioned if someone cannot work with him, he can just hire a replacement. Instilling such a thought into the minds of the staff got him on the wrong foot with them.

It\u2019s such a drastic change for the center, so a little more effort on communicating and connecting would make everything smoother. But then we wouldn\u2019t have these episodes of dramatics lol so shut up me!\n\nAlso probably unpopular, but I didn\u2019t really get why Dongju brought up Woojin trying to be like Kim Sabu in that particular moment. Past episodes, for sure. But if anything, this whole episode felt like Dongju was acting the most like Kim Sabu with how he went about his quiet/sly but probably makes sense behind the scenes plan for the center. Albeit, obviously not quite running smoothly yet. Kim Sabu looked tired of the both of them hahah. But you can tell who their teacher is!",

You don't just start working somewhere and change the whole work ethic. It breaks things rather than fix them. \n\nAnd Dongju, who knows how Doldam works should have been better equipped to handle this scenario.\n\nAlso, earlier in the season Dr Cha was the villain for trying to enforce rules, even if there was an underlying mal-intent for Kim Sabu. Dongju is the hero for taking the same approach. \n\nThere's the likeability factor, but as a story, this is running around in circles.",

I get he is the interim head but how difficult is it to give your staff an explanation for your actions? All he did is order people.  A hospital where rules were bent a lot for patients, you cannot expect it to change in a day by ordering them around. He doesn't look like a good leader right now.\n\nAlso the only wrong CEJ did was to not inform Kim sabu. &gt;!She was not wrong to leave her station because it was an emergency, was she supposed to let that person die for patients that were not even there? KDJ can call Kim sabu while CEJ is operating but he won't do that because of his pride. So much for putting patients first. Plus reprimand CEJ after the operation like wtf was that.!&lt; Didn't he do the same in S1, leaving between chairman's surgery for another patient. But the timing worked out for him so he gets away with leaving the station during a very important time.\n\nWhat he said to SWJ was uncalled for at that moment. It was right but the moment was so wrong.\n\nI try to look for positives in characters but here he isn't looking good. The only scenes I loved were of areum euntak. And Dr Jang was so cute here \"Flowers! The answer is flowers\"\n\n**episode 14** \n\n&gt;!KDJ said in previous episode only kim sabu can be kim sabu. But here he is acting like Kim sabu. He has plans but won't give any explanation to anyone and expects that people will either follow him or leave. He wants yes man on his team who will follow him without asking why. Is it really that hard to respect your staff enough to have an honest talk with them. They just want an explanation but all they get are orders. Also Kim sabu said he has no favs but he definitely does and it shows.!&lt;",

At it's basic level the Trauma Center is still a **HOSPITAL** isn't it? Instead of helping with the case load let's just stand around?? \n\nOne more thing; Kang Dong Ju had supposedly spent 2 years in the US studying Trauma Response or whatever the called it but excuse me, you're hospital is in South Korea and no one else there spent 2 years like you KDJ! What the hell haha\n\n&gt;The only diff thing here is CEJ got unlucky and the timing was wrong.\n\nAdd one more thing-CEJ is female. Hate me for saying it but I don't think it ISN'T factor somehow. From all his growth in S1 to now KDJ has an issue with CEJ and he doesn't see her as on par with him because she's a woman.

He was once a doctor in doldam and some staff knew him but many new doctors and nurses haven't met him before . In that kind of situation , he just came to the hospital , became the head and demanded everyone to do things without taking into account of what others think and want . In a team setting like a hospital , one person cannot decide everything . He probably thinks he can do whatever he wants with the existing staff since he is going to employ new staff but it doesn't work like that . Just like Master Kim said he was not being a leader . He was being a boss and an unreasonable boss at that . Doldam needs structure but not a dictatorship-like structure . Doldam needs a flexible structure because it is understaffed . KDJ sending all the patients to Doldam while he knows that Master Kim's hands are not well and SWJ has an injured hand is just unreasonable . Trauma center is for trauma patients but in certain times he needs to compromise and take in non trauma patients . KDJ may be a good doctor but he is not a good team person and if he doesn't change , he will never be a good leader . He will never beat Master Kim this way because he is more like CJM in that his ego and pride is much more important and many other things . I wonder why Master Kim chose him instead of YSJ .",

                    "comment": "You\u2019re forgetting that by the time KDJ arrived, the non-profit Trauma Centre is pressed for time to get funding - the negotiations crumbled during CJM\u2019s tenure. Which is why he had no time for pleasantries while getting the system in place for the TC to function efficiently. The place hasn\u2019t even undergone a preliminary inspection, as per the government guy showing up in ep 14.\n\nDoldham and the TC are separate entities, and he quickly and accurately assessed that the staff were not trained to discern the differences between emergency and trauma care - this should have been instilled while the TC was being built so that everyone is fully prepared by the time the place is up and running. That\u2019s on Dir Park and Kim Sabu.\n\nBoth institutions were severely understaffed - that fell on both Dir Park and Kim Sabu as well. As interim head of TC, KDJ made the call to refer non-trauma cases to Doldham, all which Kim Sabu accepted whenever he\u2019s consulted. \n\nBoth Kim Sabu and KDJ also agreed to ask for help when needed, which is why the latter transferred the little girl over to the hospital when he needed to go into surgery. Don\u2019t forget there\u2019s supposed to be another doctor on staff but she\u2019s performing surgery over at Doldham without seeking authorization from her direct superior, KDJ.\n\nWhile I agree KDJ could use more tact with personnel, the main problem is that said personnel are inadequately prepared and not willing to adjust their mindset to unfamiliar authority and how the TC should function. It also doesn\u2019t help there\u2019s a menace stoking the flames under the guise of solidarity.",

                            "comment": "I fully agree on this and I'll just add my thoughts on it. There's a difference of the trauma staff accepting Prof. Cha Jin Man and Dr. Kang Dong Joo. They respect the former even though the former doesn't do anything at all during his time at the center. The only good thing that he did for me was defending Dr. Jung In Soo against the assemblywoman eventhough Dr. Jung fully accepts his fault. Prof. Cha Jin Man was ready to lay down the rules but was shock to see irl how the Doldam doctors and staff work under Master Kim which includes a little flexibility of the rules. He tried to listen to them but still lacking and when Master Kim gave him the opportunity to continue and restart again, he resigned from his position (her daughter may have fuel his decision to leave despite Master Kim's talk to him). Meanwhile, Dr. Kang Dong Joo is also respected by the original staff members of Doldam while the new Doldam staff and doctors were intimidated by his presence alone. He knows how Doldam works but he also knows that he himself abides by the rules and regulations of a system, something Dr. Park wishes to integrate at Doldam in s2. I think the show shows that the s2 doctors and staff can't accept the fact that someone similar to their age is heading a trauma center something that some of these doctors admire to have a position someday. CJM was of similar age to Master Kim while KDJ was only a few years ahead to the new doctors at Doldam. The respect was there but different because of their age differences. Most especially to Dr. Yang Ho Jun who was envy and intimidated that someone below him became his superior when we all know that Dr. Kang Dong Joo's skills was way ahead of him.",

            "comment": "Seriously wondering where this is going when we have two episodes left for the season.\n\nThoughts/Predictions:\n\nKim Sabu\n&gt;!Deeply disturbed by the conversation between the elderly woman and Kim Sabu. Is this indicating the end of the show will be Kim Sabu\u2019s death? That basically, once he feels he\u2019s left things in a good place, he\u2019ll die. We know he\u2019s masking his symptoms. Very depressing and ominous.!&lt;\n\nJang Donghwa\n&gt;!Finally! Ever since I saw Jang Donghwa listening to a mixtape I thought he\u2019s related to Kim Sabu\u2019s former student. Can\u2019t wait for this confirmation. I think he\u2019ll finally get his act together. Also predicting he\u2019ll become a pediatric surgeon - he seemed to take his duties seriously when dealing with the injured little girl.!&lt;\n\nKang DongJu\n&gt;! Could Kang Donju be keeping the seat warm for Yoon SeoJung to become head of the trauma center? Above all, she was the closest to Teacher Kim and her dream was to be just like him and specialize in trauma. If announcements are to be believed, she\u2019s meant to be returning for Season 4.!&lt;\n\nTrauma Centre\n&gt;!Could the future of the Trauma Centre be that it actually becomes the main hospital and the old hospital becomes the trauma centre? That, or KTSB guidelines are formally changed and with this comes budget confirmation. Deeply concerned by how this boycott will affect their approvals with the minister. But being onsite during the fire, the Minister may witness first-hand how the KTSB guidelines are too strict and need to be adjusted.!&lt;\n\nJust want to add, very disappointed by the limited scenes with Nurse Oh and Do-il. Excited to finally see a scream scene from Nurse Oh next episode, it\u2019s long overdue!",

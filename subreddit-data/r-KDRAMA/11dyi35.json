            "comment": "This month I watched a lot of dramas and none of the shows I tried for the challenge were duds so I consider it a very successful month:\n\n**Fated to Love You** (9/10): Category #11: A drama starring an actor who has previously won the Baeksang best new actor or actress award.  Jang Na Ra.\n\n**Crazy Love** (8.5/10): Category #2: A drama which subverts a trope.  Amnesia.\n\n**Money Flower** (8.5/10) Category #15: A drama with a multigenerational main cast. (I had **Hide and Seek** listed in this category last month but I switched categories.  This is a revenge drama so you could use it for that but I'll be watching **The Glory** pt. 2 for that category next month)\n\n**Go Back Couple** (7/10): Category #17: A drama where the college alma mater of a character was a plot point.\n\n**Scripting Your Destiny** (7/10): Category #26: A drama from a screenwriter or director whose works you have previously enjoyed.  For me that was Kim Byung Soo, director of **Bubblegum.**\n\n**Love to Hate You** (8/10): Category #20:  A drama with a main or supporting character that is an athlete.  \n\n**W** (9/10): Category #7:  A drama chosen by the Wheel of Chance: Locations.  Bridge.",

Still, I enjoyed the main quartet and the main plot overall.\n\n* How To Be Thirty (#6) - did not enjoy this. Felt like it was trying to be too many things at once with no clear overarching theme.\n\nIn Progress:\n\n* Strong Woman Bo Dong Soon (#6) - about halfway through this one and enjoying it so far. Apart from the weird serial kidnapper side plot, it's light and fun.",

I get that they needed some reason for Bo Dong Soon to come into her powers, etc. but it just feels so tonally different and I'm a little bored with it. It's like the metal ball killer side plot in **Crash Course in Romance**. Initially I didn't mind it, but now I'm so over it.\n\nAlso, what even is his motivation? It's murky at best.

            "comment": "Ended up padding my stats this month by going on a drama special binge... oops. Future me will regret having done that when all that's left are long dramas and no palate cleansers, but here we are :D\n\nFinished this month (15/36 overall):\n\n* **Socialization - Understanding of Dance** (drama special, &lt;500 viewers). I liked this a lot. It was sweet and kind and I liked &gt;!how it wasn't a purely happy ending. Showing that the characters could have this big triumphant moment but still be struggling with the pain and shame -- it's not a binary thing of having that achievement \"overcome\" everything in one go.!&lt;\n* **Let's Meet in an Unfamiliar Season** (drama special, suggested by a fellow challenge participant). I've avoided pandemic-related media in general because it's felt so fresh and painful, but I'm glad I gave this a shot. This acknowledges the surrounding fear and trauma while mostly dwelling on the small happinesses. Thanks for the comment suggesting this, u/caninedesign!\n* **A Moment of Romance** (drama special, found by searching existing recommendations). My least favorite of the drama specials I watched this month. I liked the place it ended but even in just an hour I thought it took too long to say what it wanted to, with too much back and forth.\n* **Dr. Romantic** (referenced in another drama). Medical dramas just aren't my thing, so I kept getting bogged down in that and had to push myself through the last half of this. It was good, but not squarely for me.\n* **Poong, the Joseon Psychiatrist 2** (main lead that started as a child actor). I liked this just fine. It kinda felt like the season didn't have a strong reason to exist, but I like the characters and the actors and it was fun to watch.\n* **Live Up to Your Name** (starring an actor who was Baeksang best new actor). Surprised by this one! I love time travel shenanigans and that was all great. Kim Nam Gil was very, very good -- &gt;!that intense tone shift in episode 8-ish absolutely floored me!&lt;. \n* **The Palace** (drama special, single-episode drama). RECOMMEND. It tells such a neat story in an hour and I don't want to spoil anything but RECOMMEND.\n* **Something About 1 Percent** (inspired by a review or recommendation). Maybe going on my favorite all-time dramas list?!?? I can recognize the problematic parts while vibing with all the trope-ness of it all and reveling in the realistic people-in-a-relationship intimacy and shockingly good communication x1000. This was a near-perfect romcom for my tastes.\n* **Summer Strike** (episode with &lt;2% overall viewership rate). For me, this is a really powerful exploration of people who are barely hanging on, and how they find the reasons to keep going in relationships and community. It never cracked 2% viewership and that's a shame. It's also only 12 \\~45-minute episodes, so it goes fast if you're looking for a short one!\n\nIn progress:\n\n* **Live** (well-known supporting actor). Struggling in the first few episodes to find the hooks into the characters that's going to make me root for them and engage with the story. Sticking with it, but not much progress!\n* **Voice** (actor from my first drama). Almost finished, but this show is very meh for me. I'm constantly frustrated by how &gt;!the plot undercuts the main lead's abilities. I understand that an infallible superpower is hard for plot reasons so they need to create problems, but it is wildly inconsistent with when her supernatural hearing ability is great vs. when she's wrong/unsure/misses something. SHE HAS SPENT HER ENTIRE ADULT LIFE HONING HER ABILITY FOR USE IN CRIME SOLVING I DO NOT UNDERSTAND /rant!&lt;\n* **Another Miss Oh** (dream interpretation). Just starting this one and seems like it will be delightful. I haven't seen Eric in a drama before, so having a brand new main lead actor is exciting for me!\n* **Crash Course in Romance** (screenwriter whose works I've enjoyed). The inclusion of &gt;!the thriller/murder/etc. plot!&lt; is a real bummer for this otherwise sparkling show. I adore many of the characters and the relationships, though, so it's still a thumbs up from me even if it can't hold a candle to WFKBJ for me (and really, what could).\n* **Our Blooming Youth** (character seeking revenge). A little slow getting into this. Watching with a friend and we find ourselves being more distracted by chatting than usual and missing entire conversations but deciding it's fine and not going back. I do like the characters. Just needing something in the pacing or something to grab me.",

            "comment": "Made quite a bit of progress this month completing three dramas for the challenge! \n\n###Completed\n\n**Decoy/Bait S1** This one overall was slightly disappointing. There were parts I *really* enjoyed, namely Heo Sung Tae and Jang Geun Suk\u2019s acting. But outside of the things I enjoy, there are a number of things that have steadily lowered my rating of this drama -- chief among them being the repetitive editing. I personally prefer my dark thrillers with minimal handholding from the director/writer in helping me piece together the clues and this drama seems far too worried that the audience wouldn't get some of the connections and clues, going overboard in replaying and emphasizing them. I'm also not a fan of some of the cinematography, specifically some of the shots where they have focus pinned only on a portion of a character's face (often their eyes) while the rest of their face is out of focus. I\u2019ll be back for the second part because *hello* Heo Sung Tae but I don\u2019t think this series will be anything more than a middling thriller for me. \n\n*Challenges:* 4 (Jjajangmyeon) | 9 | 13 (Heo Sung Tae &amp; Yoo Sung Joo) | 19 | 26\n\n**KAIROS** (Rewatch) Watched with the Weekly Binge and despite starting off with trepidation that it won\u2019t be as good the second time around, I soon found myself completely engrossed. Knowing what will happen, I actually found my rewatch more meaningful because I saw the emotional and thematic connections even more clearly and really appreciated some details that I glossed over in my first watch. For my personal ratings system for dramas, I only give up to 9.5/10 points on my first watch as I save the final .5 points for rewatch value \u2014 on this rewatch KAIROS has earned that final .5 points so I\u2019ve upgraded it to a 10/10 drama for me, becoming my 15th kdrama to earn a 10/10.\n\n*Challenges:*  1 (Run away holding hands, wrist grab) | 4 (Fried Chicken, Samgak Gimbap) | 5 (Childhood Connection) | 6 (car) | 7 (Hotel) | 8 &amp; 11 (Lee Se Young)\n\n**M** Went old school (1994 drama) and enjoyed it though the very preachy message about abortion and ridiculous science fiction to back up the message was a bit hard to stomach at times. At 10 eps (~45 min episodes), the story developed nicely and was fairly compelling once I got over the preachy message about abortion. I'd recommend it to see how it treated certain issues in the context of those times but beware of awkward English, some makjang moments, and old school CGI and special effects makeup.\n\n*Challenges:* 2 (woman put handkerchief down for man to sit in Ep 3) | 5 (amnesia) |\u00a0**34**\u00a0(I'm 35th completed watcher) | 35\n\n###Currently Watching\n\n**Temptation of Wife** (93/129) I hate FL\u2019s birth family (parents and older brother) with a burning passion because they are so *useless*. That they failed to protect FL the first time around is already infuriating but to see them be a burden to the FL in her \u201csecond life\u201d \u2014 often out of selfishness \u2014 has my blood boiling. Even if I know that some of the biggest drivers of conflict in the drama are reflections and products of its time, that has not been helpful in putting out my anger. \n\n*Challenges:* 1 (Abusive Parents) | 3 | 5 (rich/poor couple) | 8 (Jang Seo Hee) | 21 | 22 | 24 | 26 (Kim Soon Ok) | 33 | 35\n\n**Kokdu: Season of Deity** (10/16) Absolute love for how well the writers are playing around with the dialogue and subversion of tropes and expectations. My favorite thing about this drama is that so much of it can be simply straightforward 'typical' romcom scenes and dialogue but once you add the fantasy\u00a0and\u00a0historical past framing to the scene, there's so much to compare and contrast that just gives the present scenes and dialogue more depth and meaning.\n\n*Challenges:* 2 (FL piggybacks ML, ML does not touch sleeping FL\u2019s face) | 4 (kimchi, ice cream, fried chicken) | 5 (childhood connection) | 17 | 26 (writers) | 31\n\n**Dream High** (Rewatch 10/16) Really enjoying this rewatch! Drama has held up well and while the acting from the kids is green all around, their energy is infectious.\n\n*Challenges:* 4 (Jjajangmyeon) | 12 (2PM) | 14 (IU) | 35\n\n###Previously\n\n[**MDL Challenge List**](https://mydramalist.com/list/LOP9gBP3)\n\n[**January**](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/10pqum7/comment/j6pls6h/)\n\n**20th Century Boy and Girl**  1 (Childhood Friends; Drowning My Sorrows) | 4 (**Tteokbokki**, also Fried Chicken, Jajangmyeon, Kimchi, Hoe, Jeon) | 9 (Kim Mi Kyung &amp; Kim Chang Wan) | 30 | 31",

The tone of it though was all over the place, you thought it was supposed to be fluffy but then takes a hard left.\n\n15. drama with multigenerational main cast - **Hunted**\n\n02/05/2023 It was a quick, dark gripping drama. Well shot, well directed, excellent overall.\n\n25. drama with a poster you loved - **Brain Works/Brain Cooperation**\n\n02/28/2023 Honestly the best part of the series was the poster. Tae Hyun was doing the most, and I did love the bromance when we actually got it, but the plot was shambles. Hated the ex-wife and that mess of a plot. It was a hald baked idea that couldn't really decide what it wanted to be.\n\n26. screenwriter/director you like - **Decoy pt.1** (director Kim Hong Seon *Guest, Black, Voice*)\n\n02/10/2023 Not going to consider done, until pt but that soundtrack is fire, so this is only half for now.\n\n27. drama from existing recommendations - **King of the Desert**\n\n02/09/2023 Super niche and totally weird, right up my ally. Recommended from kdramarecommends. Soundtrack was fire as well.\n\n29. recommendation from fellow KDC participant - **King of Pigs**\n\n02/12/2023 That ending, so good. I love a bleak, dark ending.\n\n34. drama less then 500 watches - **Someday Office** (only 40 watchers)\n\n02/22/2023 I don't even know how to expalin how I got here....it was looking at actors of BL series comming and the lead in this is supposed to be in Thai/Korean crossover with Mew.

            "comment": "Last year I was watching the Olympics in February so I only finished one drama. This year I didn't have much else to do so I finished 4 dramas, with two more in progress. That brings my total completed up to nine.\n\n**When the Camelia Blooms** \\- This was an amazingly crafted story with such whole characters. They were familiar but didn't all fit the typical kdrama character molds. The story was also incredible with several small details that would come around and be significant later on. Even being spoiled early on who the killer was, it was still fascinating watching everything unfold. I put off watching this for a long time because it was 20 long episodes and had a murder plot, but I ended up really loving it. \n\nChallenges: 2 (truck of doom), 4, 6, 9, 11, 15, 20, 21, 24\n\nWheels: jjajangmyeon, kimchi, patbingsu, ttoekbokki, fried chicken, roasted sweet potato, phone PPL, mandu restaurant PPL, restaurant (location)\n\n**Shopping King Louie** \\- It had pretty much everything I want in a light kdrama: unexpected fashion choices, loveable characters, goofy situations, cute romance, meddlesome ajummas, chaebols and rooftop houses, korea's grandma, car accidents, drama that you know will turn out okay, and &gt;!a wedding!&lt;. The characters were especially endearing. I loved Bok Shil and Louis the most but the three ajummas and the detective stood out too. Even the bad guys were a little loveable.\n\nI understand that some people could watch this and get really frustrated with Louis repeatedly spending all of Bok Shil\u2019s money, but it wasn\u2019t a dealbreaker for me. I mean, I keep eating out every week no matter how much I tell myself it\u2019s cheaper and healthier to eat at home. People can\u2019t change quickly. \n\nChallenges: 1, 2 (throwing water), 4, 8, 9, 16 (Gemini), 18, 23, 27, 30\n\nWheels: triangle kimbap, jjajangmyeon, kimchi, sundae, ttoekbokki, fried chicken, patbingsu, hide the boyfriend, amnesia, rich/poor couples, childhood connection, can only cook ramen, instant coffee PPL, cafe location, palace/mansion, rooftop apartment\n\n**Kairos** \\- I watched this for the binge even though it is not my preferred genre. It started great and then about half way through I got really bored. I am sure it is a lot more fun if you are into suspense/corruption plots. I would watch it again and stop half way, &gt;!after they prevent the kidnapping!&lt;. \n\nChallenges: 1, 2, 8, 9, 13, 19, 21, 30\n\nWheels: triangle kimbap, fried chicken, truck of doom, childhood connection, restaurant location, bridge\n\n**Love to Hate You** \\- Does everyone sing the name of this drama like in the title sequence? Because I do.  This drama was good for binging because everything happened fast and the episodes were short. I didn't like the characters, the subject matter, or the editing in the first episode but I was hooked after a few more. It has a different vibe than most kdrama rom coms so I say give it at least three episodes to see if you are interested or want to drop it. I think the best part of this show was portraying physical affection in a natural and playful way that fit with the character's personalities.\n\nChallenges: 2, 13, 16 (rooster), 36 (2022 shortform drama)\n\nWheels: hoe/sashimi, ttoekbokki, hide the boyfriend/girlfriend\n\nI'm currently watching **Crash Course in Romance** (finishes this weekend) and my long form drama **My Father is Strange** (5/52). I also watched the first two episodes of **Heavenly Idol** but I might drop that one. I think I should start something really dramatic while I'm working my way through my long family drama, maybe **The Red Sleeve**?",

            "comment": "Finally doing a check-in for this year's challenge cuz I've overcome my slump! All thanks to **Prison Playbook**! &lt;3\n\nThis month I could only check off one challenge off my list cuz I got out of my slump just recently. So progress for this month would be:\n\n**Completed**:\n\n**Prison Playbook** \\[16/16; 24th Feb, 2023\\]: *For C#26: A drama from a screenwriter or director whose works you have previously enjoyed.* \\- It was practically a rewatch cuz I was craving for some comedy slice of life dramas and thought that only this drama could give me everything that I was looking for! I first watched it in 2020 and feel like this time around I had a better understanding of the characters and their circumstances. Of course the comedy was served through and through. Looney, KAIST and Captain Yoo remain to be my most favorite characters. Would 10/10 recommend this to everyone if you're still hesitating. Give it 2 episodes cuz it becomes so much more interesting starting the 3rd episode! &lt;3\n\n**Ongoing**:\n\n**Crash Course In Romance** \\[14/16\\]: *For C#A drama which subverts a trope.* \\- I saw this recommended for this challenge on the introduction post and thought it would definitely fit in well. There are few tropes that are subverted like in the first episode it is the cut out of the ML that falls on the FL and they happen to have a paper kiss lmao, also there was a scene where he is late to a seminar that she is also attending and she ends up giving him a ride as compared to the usual tropes of the ML giving the FL a ride. I really enjoyed this drama until they got together. It still is interesting and I'm still enjoying it, it's a nice feel good warm weekend watch. However, I'm now more engrossed in the mystery aspect of the drama than the romance. Personally, my favorite character in this drama is Hae-Yi cuz I lowkey relate to some of her life crisis when I was at her age. Lowkey looking forward to the finale episodes! \n\n**The Crowned Clown** \\[3/16\\]: *For C#8: A drama with a main lead that started off as a child actor.* \\- I picked this drama cuz it had been on my list since long and it works since both Yeo Jin-Goo and Lee Se-Young were child actors. So far it's a nice watch. It's not something I'm thoroughly enjoying or loving, but it's nice enough to keep me engaged. I would like to take this moment and appreciate YJG's acting so far, it is so damn good! Also, watching LSY in this is giving me TRS flashback, why does she always end up having a heartbreak in historical dramas haha! Let's see whether I end up loving it as much as most people here do or end up finding it just fine. \n\n**On-Hold**:\n\n**Empress Ki** \\[1/51\\]: *C#33: A long form drama.* \\- I started this drama cuz I wanted to check off this soon into the challenge, however, I ended up putting it on-hold for now. Most likely will resume watching this after TCC. I picked a historical drama yet again for long form cuz surprisingly they're more engrossing than usual family dramas. I really enjoyed and loved watching SFD last year for this challenge, I hope EK doesn't disappoint me. Also, Ji Chang-Wook is so damn young in this and he looks adorable! &lt;3\n\nP.S.: This is my [MDL Challenge List](https://mydramalist.com/list/LQJpgD23) for this year! I did make a PTW list as well, let's see if I stick to it or not haha.",

I've heard that this one will suck you in and keep you interested the whole time. Last year, I watched another long family drama by the same director.

I really enjoyed this show. It was a quick watch and I enjoyed the chemistry between the two leads. I second couple was slightly random, but didn't distract from my enjoyment of the show. \n\n**Payback: Money &amp; Power -** *#26 from director or screenwriter whose work you previously enjoyed*: The screenwriter of this show also wrote DOTS. I really enjoyed the first 8 episodes of this show, but then it started to go in circles. Despite being only 12 episodes it maybe should have been 10. \n\n**High End Crush** \\- *#27 find by searching existing recs*: This was recommended for a \"Light romcom with no sad parts\". It was a short drama that was just cute. Its not long enough for a lot of development so there is not much to say other than it was a short cute watch.\n\n**Drama Special Season 13: Let's Meet in an Unfamiliar Season** \\- *#29 recommended by a fellow KDC participant*: I have seen a few drama specials and this one might be my favorite one so far. It is COVID related but I really liked how it handled everything. \n\n**Drama Special Season 9: The Tuna and the Dolphin** \\- *#32 single episode drama*: This was a cute short drama. My favorite part of it was Yoon Park. \n\n**Currently Watching:**\n\n**Island** \\- I need to finish up pt 2, but this will either be for #30 for direct translation, #12 for member of a kpop group, or #11 for previously winning new actor award. \n\n**Brain Works** \\- Using this for my Wheel of Tropes \"Jjajangmyeon or jjampong?\". Other than this show I cannot think of any other show where this trope has shown up. I am liking this show, but its one that would have benefited from being only 12 episodes.\n\n**Crash Course in Romance** \\- This drama can be fit into a lot of places. It can be used for #1 trope from Heirs, #9 supporting actors, #20 athlete. I am still enjoying it, I know some don't like the dark turn its taken but I don't mind it. \n\n**Kokdu** \\- #17 alma mater is plot point. In the beginning of the drama the reason the FL gets fired and has a hard time finding a job is due to her college not being impressive. This show is not as good as I wanted it to be, but not bad enough for me to drop so far. \n\n**Our Blooming Youth** \\- Prob #21 for disguise. Not really sure where else this can fit. \n\n**Kiss Sixth Sense** \\- #11 for previously won the best new actor award. Another one where I'm not sure where it can go other than this one. \n\n**Call it Love** \\- #22 Seeking revenge, #1 trope from heirs, #4 wheel of food (Sundae).\n\n**Never Give Up** \\- #15 multigenerational cast, #28 inspired by review\n\nNow that I am listing these, I think I'm watching too many. This list doesn't even include the dailys I started in 2022. We shall see what actually sticks.",

            "comment": "Wow, February went by fast!  I finished three dramas this month, two of which I started very spontaneously.  I ended up really enjoying them!\n\n**Completed:**\n\n31. Drama With an Episode That Received Less Than 2% Viewership Rate From Nielson: **Drama Festa: Hello Dracula** \u2013 From doing the challenge last year and this year, I realized that I tend not to seek out shorter drama specials and webdramas.  I really wanted to try more, and I ended up stumbling across this little gem.  Despite its name, it's not a supernatural monster drama at all, but very grounded in reality: three stories featuring different characters intertwine together and show each of them overcoming their problems (their \"draculas\").  It's so heartwarming and ends on a hopeful note.  Also, it has a very well-done depiction of a relationship between a lesbian daughter and her mother.  I would definitely recommend, it was a well-written, short-but-sweet snapshot of life that I'm very glad I was inspired to try.\n\n8.  Drama With a Main Lead Who Started As a Child Actor: **Kairos** \u2013 I joined in on my first weekly binge this year!  Although I enjoyed the first half more than the second half, I love time travel shenanigans and am glad that I got to see it.  I've set it for this challenge because I actually got to see Lee Se-Young as a child actress in Jewel In the Palace for last year's challenge.  I've enjoyed everything I've seen her in, and I want to watch more of her other dramas too (especially The Red Sleeve).\n\n13.  Drama Where Two or More of the Main or Supporting Cast Have Been Co-Stars In Multiple Dramas:  **Love to Hate You** \u2013 Kim Ok Bin and Yoo Teo were both in Arthdal Chronicles, Lee Joo Bin and Kim Ji Hoon were both in Money Heist, and Jung Kyung Soo and Kim Ye Ryung were both in Fluttering Warning.  This was so much fun!  It felt like eating chips to me \u2013 each episode made me want to reach for more!\n\n**In Progress:**\n\n**Father Is Strange 35/52** \u2013 I'm continuing to enjoy this one, though some of the angst is starting to get to me a bit.  Overall, still a very nice drama to relax with.  Looking forward to seeing how it ends.\n\n**Be Melodramatic 14/16** \u2013 I liked the first half much better than the second so far, I'm having a hard time finishing it because the pacing is starting to feel leisurely in a frustrating way for me.\n\n**Crash Course In Romance 12/16** \u2013 I need to catch up with this one for the finale this week!  Overall I've really loved it, but some of the developments in the last couple episodes worry me a bit.  Crossing fingers this one sticks the landing!\n\n**Our Blues 8/20** \u2013 Loving the calm, peaceful vibes of Jeju Island!  And the characters' stories I've seen so far.  I meant to watch more this month, but I got swept away by Kairos.  Just means that I have more to enjoy next month :)  \n\nEdited to add: **The Heavenly Idol 4/12** \u2013 I can't believe I forgot about this one!  So much fun, I love fish-out-of-water stories, and this one is very promising so far.",

So many characters making weird/selfish choices, lol. But there was so much going on for most of the runtime that I found it to be very watchable all the same! This one hits a lot of other challenges too. (Lots of the wheel items, probably some Heirs tropes, pet...)\n\n**#12 Kpop Group Member -** ***Hit the Spot***. Maybe not the most currently *active* groups, but both the female leads are technically current members of groups that haven't been officially disbanded! I actually really liked EXID back in their heyday, but I've somehow never gotten around to watching a Hani drama until now so this was good motivation. Really enjoyed this drama, though tbh I liked the sex advice stuff better than the actual romance plotlines. \n\n**#19 No Romance** \\- ***Trolley.*** It was a bit of a bumpy ride and definitely not for just anyone (a LOT of references to suicide and sexual assault, like, constantly), but I was satisfied with it in the end! \n\n**#23 Animal Pet** \\- ***Choco Milk Shake.*** Okay, so the animals never actually appear on screen (except for the ending animations + some photos I guess) but Choco and Milk are still basically animal pets? But also love interests?? I'm open to being told I'm wrong, especially if you can give me another challenge this one works for lol. \n\n**Currently Watching:** \n\n***The Glory*** **(5/currently 8)** \\- I'm one of the people who waited to get into this until I wouldn't have to wait for part 2, and that was definitely the right choice. I'm thinking #26...you got me again, KES!! \n\n***Be Melodramatic*** **(13/16)** \\- Rewatch, probably to be #2, trope subversion. \n\n***School 2013*** **(6/16) -** \\#35 (10+ year old drama), unless something else comes up. \n\n***Once Again*** **(24/100)** \\- Didn't make much progress with this one this month, but it's still my attempt at a long-form drama for the year. \n\n**Next month:** I really have my eye on ***Oasis*** right now, and it looks like Seol In-ah and Jang Dong-yoon were also both in School 2017, so that can be #13!",

I would have enjoyed it more if I waited until I was in the mood for it, but I watched it because of the weekly binge. It was really good and the twists definitely left me guessing. \n\n15) Multigenerational cast - live. my favorite of the dramas I completed this month, which is a huge surprise since I\u2019m not a fan of cop dramas usually. The show had a lot of heart. \n\n17) College alma matter - interest of love. It was ok, though it did get better at the end. It did bother me that so many people got hurt because the fl didn\u2019t talk to the ml, but then again, this wouldn\u2019t be a kdrama without that. \n\nIn progress: \n\n- bring it on ghost (12/16)\n- she would never know (6/16)\n- taxi driver 2 (4/16)\n- crash course in romance (14/16)\n- Welcome to wedding hell (8/16)",

That's good as I'm gonna have relaxed watching mode next, plus I'm planning to watch more long dramas, so I need to free my time. Btw, finally completed first level - relaxed watcher (6 challenges)\n\nDramas in order I've completed them:\n\n- **The Smile Has Left Your Eyes** - it was a hard ride! Its oppressive atmosphere made it long watch, or maybe that's because I spoiled ending for myself... I had great expectations, as it has so many positive reviews and stars one of my favorite actresses, but it wasn't \"my drama\". Although, I don't regret I finished it because it turned out to be that I remembered spoiled parts differently, so ending still had some surprises for me and final scene made me wanna cry. And I'm glad &gt;!they made leads not related by blood!&lt;\n\n*Suitable challenges: 23, 24, 26*\n\n- **Your Honor** - good drama, I liked its premise with criminal being a judge. Don't have much to say about it. It was funny how ML tried to stay true to himself but ended up being goodie (mostly with no intention). Main couple felt awkward for me, cannot say why, they were comfortable about their relationship haha\n\n*Suitable challenges: 5, 9, 13, 21*\n\n- **Flower in Prison** - great historical drama! It's not typical palace drama, royal intrigues are more like subplot. It depicts different spheres of life and professions, mostly connected to trade. FL grew in prison, raised by staff and criminals, so she's quite unusual and interesting character. She had different skills and was really smart. ML was a criminal-turn-to-merchant, so it's another interesting character. It has many storylines and characters with their backgrounds, all 51 episodes feel right without many fillers\n\n*Suitable challenges: 9, 11, 19, 21, 22, 30, 33*\n\n- **Fan letter, please** - lighthearted drama despite harsh topics. It was simple watch. That's good if you wanna take a break from all dark heavy dramas with a lot of events, action, etc. \n\n*Suitable challenges: 12, 15, 36*\n\n**Drama in progress:**\n\nDong Yi (38/60) \n\nThis February is legit a month of Han Hyo Joo for me, with all episodes of Dong Yi and movie Always (plus her birthday in February). Gonna extend it for March",

It was such a hidden gem for me. I loved the cast, I loved the found family aspect, I loved the fantasy elements. Really just such an emotional watch. My only complaint is that S2 didn't wrap up as neatly as S1. I hope that means a S3 is on the horizon.\n\n[**Weak Hero Class 1**](https://mydramalist.com/702267-weak-hero) (*#19: a drama with no or minimal romance*) - Maybe it was because my expectations were too high or maybe I'm jaded by the anime industry and shows that feel like obvious advertisements for the source material, but this was such a miss for me. The stakes were all over the place and the moral seemed to be .. &gt;!make sure you add your friends on Instagram? lmao.!&lt; IDK. &gt;!Young Yi was such an important catalyst but so ridiculously underdeveloped as a character. She needed way more scenes to actually feel like a believable 'threat' imo.!&lt; To it's credit, the acting and the OST were superb. Park Ji Hoon was shockingly good and Choi Hyun Wook was giving AU Cho Seungyoun which made me instantly attached to him.\n\n[**My Name**](https://mydramalist.com/65391-nemesis) (*#22: a drama with a character seeking revenge*) - Even though I predicted the way things would play out pretty early on, it was still a quick, enjoyable watch. The friend I watched it with w&gt;!as convinced Cha Gi Ho was a bad guy, but I know Kim Sang Ho better than that. That man stays choosing the most honorable, sacrificing, moral-driven character roles lol (disclaimer: I havent seen every Kim Sang Ho drama, but I have seen many.)!&lt; ~~Shin Ryujin~~ Han So Hee absolutely owned that role.\n\nI'm also **currently watching**...\n\n**Secret Royal Inspector &amp; Joy** \\- (6/16) - I'm a Taecyeon drama competitionist. I know this show got mixed reviews, but I really picked it up at the perfect time. After back to back to back dark, heavy dramas, this is so light and chill. The comedy works for me and the plot isn't overly complicated. It's a nice break from the genres I've been watching lately.\n\n**I Hear Your Voice** \\- (5/18) - (*#24 a drama you've always watched to watch*) - only got in 2 episodes this month, but it's still really enjoyable and nostalgic.\n\n**Taxi Driver S2** \\- (3/16) - Obsessed with this show. Can't believe I'm watching it as it airs and not waiting to binge, but I really can't help myself lol  \n\n\nI've also been rewatching **Goblin** and **Youth of May**, but I'm trying to not use any rewatches for the challenge. If it comes down to the wire and I need to sub one in, then I might, but I'm hoping to complete it with all new dramas. I also rewatched **Alice in Borderlands S2**. I think I could potentially use that for #36 a a non-k drama, but I haven't decided yet.  \n\n\nHope everyone had a good February!",

I cried when Si-eun &gt;! smiled for the very first time while they were in the hospital.!&lt; And it was such a weird feeling, crying seeing someone smile. Then I was just mad and then episode 7 came and all hell broke loose, I thought he really &gt;! died. !&lt; I don't even know what to say about this one. I just loved it, from the cast, the acting, the story, Si-eun's and Su-ho's friendship, the pain, the light moments in between, the OST, the production, just everything. It was just heartbreakingly perfect. I feel so bad for Si-eun, it is still hurting me. It's been a long while since I watched anything that made me cry so hard. This drama will be in my mind for a long time.",

Also, I'm not watching the newest or most hyped-up dramas so maybe that's another reason.

I know it's short, but I really like hockey.\n\nIn progress\n\n33 Once again - Ooookay, my first long form drama. it's going well, I'm sticking to 1 or 2 per day. I love the family.\n\n24 Just Between Lovers - I'm so glad I started this! I just finished episode 12 and I love this drama so far.\n\n21 or 22 Taxi Driver 2\n\n10 Kokdu: season of the Deity\n\n1 Crash Course in Romance\n\n7 It's Okay to Not Be Okay - rewatch, but it has a great bridge scene.\n\n25? 9? The Heavenly Idol - I may have to pause this one. It's cute, but I'm having trouble getting into it, especially in small doses. It might work out better if I wait and binge it when I'm in the mood for it.\n\nI'm trying to kind of shoe horn in Flower of Evil, just cause I feel like a rewatch. I'm thinking I'll work for #36, #20 in 2022 was a drama with multiple timelines. FOE has so many flashbacks, I think it works okay. Maybe #25 because who doesn't love that poster? Maybe I'll just watch it.\n\nAlso, I don't know where else to ask, how does it work to submit your completed challenge through the challenge introduction post? I signed up for MDL just for this but I usually just track my dramas in a plain ol' Keep list. Do I just make a post with my list and edit throughout the year?",

When you fill that out you need to link a comment (can be any challenge post - some people like to update one on the intro post throughout the year) or a list most people make lists on MDL using the custom list function (you just need to make sure it's not private or it can't be checked).",

I really enjoyed all the characters too.\n\n**36.** **Hospital Playlist:** I originally dropped this one twice a while back, but once I started watching again this year I started to really love it after the first few episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Currently watching:**\n\n**1.

I like the ghosts.\n\n**12. The Devil Judge** 1/16: I only got a chance to watch 1 episode of it, but I liked the episode that I saw. I haven't been in the mood to watch something so dark lately though.\n\n**33. My Father is Strange** 24/52: This kdrama has me completely enraptured. I cannot tear myself away from it. That's the problem with long form dramas for me, because I tend to binge them and do nothing else.\n\n**35**. **Sungkyunkwan Scandal** 4/20: I haven't touched it since January, but have been hoping to get back to it soon.

I am reserving the right to move these around later in the year, but since the beginning of the year, I have finished challenges for: \n\n* \\#3 A drama that was referenced in another drama: **Boys Over Flowers** (referenced in ep5 of Pegasus Market) I was watching them both at the same time and was so excited I got the reference, otherwise this was a painful watch for me and I hate-finished most of it)\n* \\#6 A drama chosen by the Wheel of Chance: PPL (Restaurant): **Live** (Subway). I watched this one because I noticed it was going to be leaving Netflix, and I'm so glad I caught it!  Took several episodes to get into it, but by the end I really loved it.  \n* \\#9 A drama starring a well known supporting actor: **Under the Queen's Umbrella** (Kim Hae Sook).  I was blown away by the performances in this one.  A couple dramas later I realize I am watching a lot of Kim Hae Sook right now and just loving her range.  \n* \\#10 A drama starring one of the actors from your first drama: **Tomorrow** (Rowoon from The King's Affection).  Bittersweet and achingly beautiful and just lovely storytelling, and made me fall for Rowoon all over again.  \n* \\#19 A drama with minimal or no romance: **Never Give Up**.  But the bro-mance was worth it!  \n* \\#20 A drama with a main or supporting character that is an athlete: **Prison Playbook**.  Also raced to finish before it left Netflix.  I didn't think I would like it given the context, so I'm glad I read a few comments here and just jumped in.  I'm so sad it's gone now because I would love to recommend it to a few people!\n* \\#21 A drama featuring disguises or false identities: **Healer**.  WOW!  Glad I finally caught up with that one!!!  Fun ride.  \n* \\#22 A drama which features a character seeking revenge: **Pegasus Market**.  This one took several episodes for me to get into it, but by the end it had wormed its way into my heart.  Found myself literally laughing out loud, often!\n* \\#29 A drama suggested by a fellow KDC participant : **Yumi's Cells**.  Loved the double storyline format, undecided how I feel at the conclusion of the story.  \n* \\#32 A single episode drama: **My Friend is Still Alive** (Drama Special Season 4).  What an absolute gem!  Loved the tight story arc. \n\nI'm still working on **My Father is Strange** (for #33 long form drama), **Crash Course in Romanc**e (for #26 A drama from a screenwriter or director whose works you have previously enjoyed, same director as Hometown Cha Cha Cha) and **Reply 1988** (challenge TBD but leaning towards 13 or 24).  \n\nI'm so thankful to others who have posted reviews or tracking spreadsheets or MDL lists.  I have added so many to my watchlist!!",

But I figure....go for it! And if I don't make it, I'll have succeeded on one of the easier levels. :-D\n\nMy strategy is to watch shows that fit into several categories, but be flexible with assigning them. (I actually made a paper plan with boxes for each challenge and small post-it notes with the titles I complete. I can move the post-it notes around as needed!)\n\nSo far, here is where I am:\n\n# Completed:\n\n**The New Employee --** I liked this one. The relationship was sweet, and I really liked that both main characters knew they were gay so there wasn't a \"oh my gosh, I like man, what do I do??\" drama.  (possibly using for *college alma mater is a plot point)*  \n**The Director Who Takes Me to Dinner** \\-- Also liked this one, although The New Employee was a better office romance, in my opinion. This one had elements of fantasy that I didn't think were explored as well as they could have been. Perhaps a result of too little screen time. (possibly using for *Location: restaurant*)  \n**My Holo Love** \\- A fun show! The middle dragged because I wanted the FL to discover the ML's identity sooner. And, as always, I wish the show lingered on the resolution a bit longer. I really wish shows didn't do a \"bam! conflict resolved! show over!\" I want to linger and find out how they do a bit more. But I always want more of that. (possibly using for *disguises or false identities,* or perhaps for *can only cook ramyeon,* and I can re-watch **Healer**...my all time favorite!)  \n**Choco Milk Shake** \\- Such a sweet show! Magical realism done right. (possibly using for *at least one animal pet*, although I'm not totally sure it qualifies, since the pets become lead characters. It's a bit odd! Might need to change categories for this one.)  \n**I Do, I Do** \\-- I loved this one, but I always love a noona romance. It's older but I didn't feel it was dated for some reason. (probably using for *drama over 10 years old*.)\n\n# In Progress:\n\n**Hotel Del Luna** \\-- I'm watching this on my subway commute, so it's a bit disjointed, but it's so beautiful that I'm enjoy it a lot. I have a feeling the ending will be bittersweet, which I don't like....but I'm sticking with it!  \n**Little Women** \\-- I'm about 2/3 of the way through this one, and I paused. I'm not sure why, but I'll definitely finish it. Probably next week sometime.  \n**Love in Contract** \\-- I got a little bored with this one, but I need to pick it back up and finish it.",

I had to put everything on hold to focus on the binge, how did we manage to do this every month before and pack in other dramas and life? I don\u2019t know!\n \n**Completed**\n\n**Kairos** - Challenge TBD - Everyone came up with a long list of challenges this one fit so I\u2019m spoiled for choice. I haven\u2019t pinned it to one just yet. I still really enjoyed the drama but had a better watch experience the first time around with only my thoughts and opinions. Some of the tidbits people came up with were great additions to the watch experience. \n\n**In Progress**\n\n**Crash Course In Romance** (14/16) - Challenge TBD - I think my final opinion of this drama will heavily hinge on the treatment of Jae Woo\u2019s character. I hope we can get some more banchan and cuteness before the end (and everything wraps up well).\n\n**Doctor Stranger** (10/20) - Challenge TBD - I only watched two episodes of this one this month so I don\u2019t have much to say. There was a big reveal in one of them but I\u2019m not confident I will make it through. \n\n**Unlock My Boss** (10/12) - Challenge TBD - This is a lot heavier than I expected it to be, I was expecting more comedy. I was feeling a little ambivalent after a break but I\u2019m getting back into the story now. Interested to see how it ends.\n\n**Twenty Five Twenty One** (8/16) - Challenge #20 athlete main character - My family tried **The Interest of Love** and promptly dropped it (phew) so I suggested a few I\u2019d been thinking of rewatching that they hadn\u2019t seen. 25-21 is just as enjoyable as the first time around. &lt;3\n\n**Up Next**\n\nThere are a few on-airs I am thinking about watching - **Taxi Driver 2**, **Kokdu**, **Our Blooming Youth** and **The Heavenly Idol**. Definitely can\u2019t do all four at once! Also thinking about using **Trot Lovers** for the reunited cast challenge but I should have a little break between my SSR so I can miss his handsome face a little. \n\n**Previously**\n\n[**January Check In**](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/10pqum7/comment/j6lwj83/)\n\n**Dr. Park\u2019s Clinic** - #18 dream interpretation \n\n**Under The Queen\u2019s Umbrella** - #4 WoC Food: Kimchi - (episode 16) \n\n**Run On** - #6 WoC PPL; Sportswear",

Challenge for all of these is still TBD.\n\n**Completed**\n\n* **Under the Queen's Umbrella** \\- This was good and I liked its messaging around being a mother. I wasn't necessarily blown away, but I did end up accidentally breezing through it in like 5 days because it was such a pleasant watch.\n* **Mystic Pop-Up Bar** \\- Surprisingly funny and I love the found family dynamics. Also have to admit that it was amusing going directly from seeing Choi Won Young as the king in Under the Queen's Umbrella to the more silly and playful character here!\n* **Love to Hate You** \\- It was fun but I'm in the minority here because I found its take on feminism to be problematic which ruined the entire experience for me. I also felt this way about Strong Woman Do Bong Soon when I watched that years ago though so nothing new I guess, it's different for everyone!\n\n**Currently Watching**\n\n* **Crash Course in Romance** (14/16) - This ends next week so gives me one more to cross off on the list! I don't mind a good mystery plot but the one here is so terribly predictable and not executed all that well, so at this point I'm kind of just watching to finish. The first half was great though!\n\n**Moving Forward**\n\nI unfortunately didn't love any of the dramas I saw this month as much as I had hoped so it's put me in a kdrama slump. Currently taking a break and have fallen back into a Cdrama trap (especially after finishing LBFAD in January). I don't expect to make any progress in the challenge next month since I'll be watching those instead but that's okay!",

On to Serious Watcher territory...\n\n**Drama Special Season 11: The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work** (2020)  **#34** Less than 500 watchers on MDL . It was a pretty enjoyable short watch. I'm always impressed if the actors can get their characters believably across in such a short format.\n\n**Drama Special S. 11: The Reason Why I can't Confess** \\- **#7** [Restaurant Location](https://koreandramaland.com/listings/alleyway-gwanggyo/) or **#32** single episode drama. Thought it was pretty cute and I recognised the ML from 12 Nights from his movements, so that was fun - he played a dancer in that and here he is a photographer.\n\n**You Drive Me Crazy** (2018) **#23** has an animal pet:  A Hedgehog!!! Who gets 3 different abodes during the two hours of this short drama. I skipped it a few years ago when the Weekly Binge was watching shorts and remembered the comments about the cute hedgehog. Glad I waited. It was fun to see Hometown Cha Cha Cha ML as the ML here and I wouldn't have known who he was back then.\n\n**The Interest of Love** \\- **# 17** Alma Mater was a plot point. Several of the characters went to the same uni and their higher education was definitely a plot point.  I worked as a bank teller during summer breaks in uni, so that was why I decided to watch. The good acting and unpredictable plot kept me going. Had planned to use it for **#5** Rich/Poor Couple Trope, but I think that is easy enough to find elsewhere.\n\n**Brain Works** \\- **# 12** Starring a current member of a Kpop group - Jung Yong Hwa of CN/BLUE. Not sure that I would have continued after the first Ep except for the challenge and the fact that I have enjoyed the ML in The Package and in Sell Your Haunted House, which I would recommend over this one for this challenge, as this was pretty mediocre. Finishes tonight.\n\nEdit: I had picked the short dramas by different means, but enjoyed the write ups that I found later at [They call it a special for a reason](https://www.tumblr.com/kimchislaphearts). Will be checking it later when I am stumped and need a short drama for a challenge. Thanks, u/sianiam",

He is late and she is not there, so we assume it's due to his lateness and he barely missed her, but find out the rest of the story later. It subverted my expectations, but is that a trope per se? Another time the Trip and Embrace trope was used a bit differently.  So, I would count it as a subversion. Not sure if these fall into the Heirs categories - that was a long list! Looking at it now- Subverts The Beta Couple. Uses Big Fancy House to show wealth. Clingy Jealous Girl. Inter-class Romance. Will They or Won't They. Ok, there are plenty of Heirs tropes in here.",

Entertwined fingers, clingy jealous girl, and the big damn kiss.\n* **Reply 1994** \u2014 For challenge 4, the food challenge. Mine was sundae, and there was a scene in episode 12 involving it.\n* **Law School** \u2014 For challenge 28, based on a recommendation, review, or comment from either of the kdrama subreddits. I have the link to the comment in my MDL list for the challenge.\n\nThe ones in progress are:\n\n* **Kokdu: Season of Deity (10/16)** \u2014 For challenge 2, a drama which subverts a trope. The powerful grim reaper is forced to be a servant to the FL. Also, the whole surveillance team having his back thing when you think he's about to get caught.\n* **Our Blooming Youth (6/20)** \u2014 For challenge 21, a drama featuring a disguise or false identity, and the FL fits that description. So does the 2FL.\n* **Crash Course in Romance (14/16)** \u2014 For challenge 26, a drama with a director or writer whose work I enjoyed previously since I enjoyed Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo. \n* **Record of Youth (4/16)** \u2014 For challenge 30, since it's a direct translation of the Korean title.\n* **Taxi Driver 2 (4/16)** \u2014 For challenge 36 for now, since it fits the directed by a female/written by a male challenge in 2022.",

            "comment": "I was hoping to get a lot watched in Feb. But because I went away in Feb (supposed to be for a week, but turned into 10 days instead), I had a lot less time to watch dramas. I did complete three though. \r  \n \r  \n**Completed:**\r  \n**Payback: Money and Power** \\- 12/12 (Challenge #22 A drama which features a character seeking revenge). I really loved the early eps of this. But by the end I wasn't enjoying it as much. I am still glad I watched it though.\r  \n\r  \n**Poong, the Joseon Psychiatrist (Season 2)** \\- 10/10 (Challenge #8 A drama with a main lead that started off as a child actor). I love this drama. Near the end of season 2, it did feel a bit more angsty than what I would have hoped for. But it was still pretty great overall.\r  \n\r  \n**Bad and Crazy** \\- 12/12 (Challenge #19 A drama with minimal or no romance)\r  \nI started this at the end of Jan. My first impression was \"this drama is literally bad and crazy.\" I watched 3 eps and thought about dropping it. But I decided to give it another couple of eps and see. In the end, I really enjoyed this. So I am glad I decided to stick it out and watch until the end.\r  \n\r  \n**Ongoing:** \r  \n**Once Again** \\- 52/100 (Challenge #33 A long form drama). \r  \nThis drama is so damn easy to binge. I forced myself to put it on hold to watch some other dramas. Also because I was worried I would get sick of it or something. But honestly, I love this drama so much. It's so easy to just keep watching ep after ep of this.\r  \n\r  \n**King 2 Hearts** \\- 4/20 (Challenge #26 A drama from a screenwriter or director whose works you have previously enjoyed). Haven't watched any of this at all in Feb. I should watch a few more eps and see how I feel about. The villain... seems completely crazy/insane/ridiculous to me?\r  \n\r  \n**Crash Course in romance** \\- 11/16. (Challenge #16 A drama where one of the main cast shares your zodiac sign)\r  \nDecided to wait until it's finished and binge the remaining eps since it's painful waiting for each ep.\r  \n\r  \n**Brainworks**  \\- 9/16 (Challenge #25 A drama whose poster you liked at first sight)\r  \nI put this on hold when I went away. I am enjoying this more than I thought I might. It's definitely a fun watch. Will probably finish this next.\r  \n\r  \nIn March I will start the dramas that I have been waiting to watch, like heavenly idol, our blooming youth, Taxi Driver 2 and Island pt2 etc. Also planning to finish Once Again.",

Subverts a trope:  **Crash Course in Romance** \\- (She stumble into his arms the first episode, but she stumbles into a poster!) This has been a wonderful ride! Great drama, great cast, etc. \n\n3. Referenced in another drama: **Our Beloved Summer - (**Ep. 15 in Cheer Up)  I watched this one in January and really enjoyed it \n\n4. Trope Wheel - Roasted Sweet Potatoes: **Rewatch of Goblin,** (My All-Time Favorite Drama) \n\n5. Trope Wheel - Childhood Connection: Rewatch of **Gu Family Book**\n\n7. Trope Wheel - Palace: **Our Blooming Youth**\n\n9. Supporting Actor:  **If You Wish Upon Me -** Sung Song Il\n\n16. Zodiac Sign - Scorpio - **Our Blooming Youth** This drama will move to this spot if I watch another palace drama. I'm sure I will during this year. I haven't seen Under the Queen's Umbrella yet, so that will go up to #7, I think. \n\n21. False Identities: **The Heavenly Idol**\n\n22. Revenge: **The Glory, of course**\n\n24. Finally seeing this one:  **My Liberation Notes** This is moving sooo slowly. I hope I get through it. If I don't. I guess I'll take it off this Challenge.  \n\n28. Drama inspired by r/KDRAMA:  **Love to Hate You.** I'm so glad I saw the comments and so glad I watched this one! \n\n30. Title Direct Translation:  **Island -** I have not watched this one yet, but I am planning to in the coming days. So I guess this will be for March! \n\n31. Drama with an episode les than 2%:  **Summer Strike.** I was on a trip over the holidays, so I watched this one when i returned at the very beginning of January. Hope I can count it! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess 12 at this point is pretty good! I've got a few more that I am watching and trying to finish.",

            "comment": "Added 5 challenges this month for a total of 11.\n\n**10. Drama starring actor from 1st drama. The Interest of Love: Yoo Yeon-seok** from Mr. Sunshine. Loved everything about this drama from the acting and writing to the fact that it was a very raw and realistic analysis of what it takes to be in a relationship. Not your standard formulaic K-drama.\n\n**3. Drama referenced in another drama. Find me in your memory** (cameo on Sh\\*\\*oting Stars). This was to balance the emotional devastation of The Interest of Love to see Moon Ga-young in a happy peppy romantic part.\n\n**2. Drama the subverts a trope. Flower Crew: Joseon Marriage Agency.**  Trope: poor girl falls for a poor guy in Joseon/Silla and he turns out to be the heir to the throne, they eventually live happily ever after. I dropped Poong and looked for more period dramas with Kim Min-jae. It was not perfect, but it was a fun watch especially because of the feisty FL who doesn't want to be the Queen.\n\n**23. Drama with at least one animal pet. Can we be strangers?** This may be unconventional, but there was an entire episode on a custody case for a dog, so the pet was pretty important. Another uncompromising look at relationships. The writing was nowhere close to The Interest of Love and eventually it was a let down.\n\n**35. Drama at least 10 years old. Princess Hours (2006).** I saw that it's getting a remake and I thought I'd give it a try. This is really dated and one of the worst cases of Stockholm Syndrome I've ever seen. The ML was so mean. If you want an oldie, I would definitely recommend Coffee Prince over this.",

            "comment": "I made a lot of progress in January, thanks to a longer than usual break between semesters. February has been slightly less productive.\n\nThis month I finished: \n\n**Love to Hate You**  for #28: a drama inspired by a review, recommendation or comment. I've seen lots or recommendations for this (at least in the discussion thread). And this one was so much fun! Just long enough, great chemistry between the leads. Loved that they actually communicated with each other.\n\n**Should We Kiss First** for a challenge yet to be determined. I'm considering a few possibilities: #1 A drama featuring one of the tropes from The Heirs (rich man, poor woman trope--though this drama feels as far from The Heirs as one can get), #8 A drama with a dream interpretation. #30 A drama whose title is a direct translation of the Korean. # 32 A drama with at least one pet. I'm leaning towards #8, though.  This drama was slow and difficult to understand. I think something was lost in translation; the dialogue is very important in the drama. But I loved the story of hope and redemption, and I enjoyed seeing somewhat older adults as stars of a romance.\n\n**9 Ends, 2 Outs** for #35, a drama at least 10 years old. This one moved a bit slowly, but it was a great friends-to-lovers story. \n\n**Ongoing:**\n\n**Five Enough** (15/54) for #33, a long form drama. I *loved* **My Father is Strange** and **Once Again.** This drama has taken a bit more time to draw me in, though I'm becoming more invested in it. I do find myself ff'ing some of the storylines.\n\n**Crash Course in Romance** (4/16) for #16, main cast member shares your Zodiac sign. Jung Kyung Ho is a Virgo. This one is definitely worth the hype! I've been drawn in right away. It has shades of **Sky Castle** plus a rom com? Not sure what I think about a particular side plot; those of you who have watched the drama will know what I'm talking about.",

            "comment": "This month check in for me :\n\nI watched The light in your eyes (challenge 13 as three of the ML have played in Our Blues and two have played in Law School. Plus the leads have played together in the movie Josee). This drama is so good, I don't know how I had never heard of it before. It starts all fluffy and funny then there's a first plot twist. After a few episodes, it gets a bit redundant (and the FL is really annoying) but then, at episode 10, there's the main plot twist and right then, this drama became one of my favorite ever. \nSpoiler alert : you'll need boxes of tissues to get through this one !\n\nI finished The King's affection (challenge 21) and it is as good as everybody had said. Park Eun-bin is an amazing actress. When she dresses as a woman, I really feel she's the king in disguise and not the other way around !\n\nAlso finished Go Back Couple (challenge 29, thanks for suggesting this one). I enjoyed it even if it's not an exceptionnal drama.\n\nI'm still watching Crash Course in Romance (challenge 7 location school). Last two episodes this weekend \ud83d\ude2d\nWaiting for the second part of The Glory (challenge 10) which will also be finished in March.\n\nI started Our Blooming Youth (challenge 26, same screenwriter as Lovestruck in the city and Romance is a bonus book), so far so good.\n\nAnd I'm binging Taxi Driver season 1 before the second season for challenge 25 (poster I liked at first sight). I watched 7 episodes and it's a good watch so far.\n\nI also watched Weak Hero Class 1 but I had seen the first 4 episodes last year so it doesn't count. I'm glad I finished it though, I'll be sure to follow Park Ji-hoon and Choi Hyun-wook in their next drama/movie as they are really promising actors.\n\nQuite a busy February. Bring it on, March !!!",

I will move those I liked the best to the intropost for challenges later on.\n\nSo far I saw: **Alchemy of Souls** - love part one, hate part two. \n\n**Kairos** - time slip thriller with murder and corruption. I would have dropped this if it was not for the binge. Next year's binge I will not vote for a thriller. If there is nothing much apart from the thriller plot, it is not for me. \n\n\n**Love to Hate You**. Loved this short drama, would have liked it to be a bit more developed characters, particularly the side characters were a bit dull. \n\n**Crazy Love** - the genius tsundere who falls for the woman who has the extremely rare traits loyalty and kindness. Somehow I feel that I saw something similar before. Fun at first, good enough to sit through the whole. \n\n\nI am taking it easy this year, and have also watched a couple of Chinese dramas.

Dramas that include the type of comedy in this one are hit or miss for me and this one I had a hard time focusing and had to keep going back to rewatch as it was hard to stay into the story for me. \n\nThe Light in your Eyes:  Using for #15.  This story and acting was so good and this was a bit of an emotional ride.  .Watched this over 3 days and do recommend.  There was some good depth to this drama and this one could very well end up on my rewatch list. \n\nPayback:  Money and Power:  Using for #22.  Started this one about halfway through its airing and it was awesome.  I am not a big fan of the corporate / political corruption stories as its used so very often and I've seen so many the last year or so but this one hit the bullseye for how this type of drama should be done as far as I'm concerned.  Lee Sun Kyun is so good with this role and Kang Yoo Seok's performance made me want to keep an eye out for his future roles.  Great option for the revenge challange.\n\nOur D-Day:  Using for #34.  This was actually very good imo  compared to most web dramas I've seen (granted I've not watched a ton).  While there was no mystery as to what was going on with the story, the topic and approach were well done and the acting was good.  I'd recommend; however, review the topic as it could be a trigger for some people.  \n\nI've completed 11 of 36 total so far.   I'm actually rewatching Mr. Queen right now and I've not decided if I will use that for a challenge but I needed to watch something to make me smile because I've had a hard month.  This month was a slow drama month overall for me because of Girls Scout cookie season and all of the nonsense I had to deal with for that; however, I did get to watch some I had been planning to watch for a bit.  March will be better I'm sure since I will no longer be dealing with cookie moms and cookie craziness after this weekend.",

I don't know if I'll ever fully recover. (20/10!!)\n\n  \nSummer Strike - Category 23 - This was my first Im Si-wan drama, and I'm very happy for it. I can't wait to watch some of his other dramas. Overall loved the storyline and Kim Seol Hyun was a pleasure to watch - I could relate so much to her character (tiny apartment buddies!)\n\n  \nLittle Women -  Category 5a - I'd been putting off watching this drama for so long, and my Netflix algorithm knew me better than I knew myself, so of course it kept recommending it to me every chance it got. Kim Go-Eun's acting is top freaking notch and the chemistry between her and Wi Ha-Joon was so palpable, my TV was sweating. \n\n**In Progress**\n\nMisaeng Incomplete Life - It's going pretty slow so far, hopefully it'll pick up...",

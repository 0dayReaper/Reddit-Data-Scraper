The drama also shows the search for the person who drew the princess as the star of a chunhwa (erotic pantings from an earlier period).",

I'm guessing it will be slightly more explicit than most terrestrial kdramas because the producers won't be constrained by censorship/content rating guidelines, but it will still be in line with western TV standards.",

            "comment": "**Crash Course in Romance** (14/16): Episodes 13 and 14 were a contrasting pair. In Episode 13, it felt like the mystery/crime storyline was starting to weigh down the rest of the narrative, especially the main couple's relationship. Episode 14 did not attempt to pull back from this wide-ranging focus, but instead brilliantly brought all of these elements together, through backstories and drawing parallels between past and present situations.\n\n**Love to Hate You** (10/10): A very satisfying series in all respects. Go Won-hee was very likable as Mi-ran's roommate, and it was amusing to see &gt;!Denver and Misun from Money Heist: Korea cross paths again in very different circumstances!&lt;. Finally, the instrumental opening of Taeil's song from the soundtrack, [\"Lovey Dovey\"](https://youtu.be/5hl_WfNkynE), reminds me of a rainy Sunday afternoon back in my hometown in Australia.",

I haven't read the book, but I heard the biggest change was mixing the past and the present, which I think was the best part of the show. It was really moving to see the contrast between the hardship of the past and the luxury of modern times.\n\nMy only criticism is that sometimes the plot was a little melodramatic and Solomon's plot just wasn't as interesting as Sunja's. I was captivated by Sunja's adventures (past and present), but a guy who doesn't know where his financial career will go, just isn't as interesting.",

I always have a smile on my face when I\u2019m watching it. It\u2019s so good. \n\n3. **Taxi Driver 2** (4/16): It is so hilarious and the best drama out of the ones airing right now, I think. I'm loving the team this time even more and the cases are interesting.\n\n4. **Penthouse (1/21):** Nobody told me it had an excellent first episode?? Anyway, I tried rewatching clips from Extraordinary You and thought I wanted to watch something with KYD, so I started this one. I already love the cast and I love how OTT this is. I\u2019m so frustrated right from the beginning but I NEED to watch the rest! Ah, I\u2019ve already forgotten about KYD because the rest of the cast is\u00a0\ud83e\udd0c. \n\nI\u2019m also gonna start watching **Call It Love** soon because it looks messy as hell. I wanted to rewatch One Spring Night and I feel like it would be better to watch a new melodrama instead of re-watching it, maybe. I'd first love to see how people are liking it though!",

Definitely not my type of drama, but I did like the relationship between the leads. Also the friendship between the students. Sol A is amazing. 5/10. Maybe it's your type of drama. Cannot recommend it cause it wasn't for me, but I encourage you to try and see if it is yours.\n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n* **Our Blooming Youth (8/20)** \u2014 It's moving pretty slowly. Although there are some parts I like, I don't know what they want to do at this point. I'm staying for Park Hyung Sik, though. He suits this role well. The 2FL and 2ML also have a great relationship.\n* **Kingdom 2 (1/6)** \u2014 I love how the zombies are interesting. Won't say how, but it's very much a game of discovering how they work and what their weakness is. And, not a spoiler, but the zombies get more terrifying this season. I love it.\n* **Record of Youth (4/16)** \u2014 I love the chemistry between the leads. They work well together on screen. The family dynamic for the ML is still very interesting, but the grandpa. Oh, harabeoji. I love him so much. The mothers are boring, though. I hate their story, and the acting doesn't do it justice either. The 2ML's mother, especially. I cannot with her. The son, the 2ML, is dull as well. Despite all that I dislike, there's more that I like so far. The ending of episode 4 was cool, and it makes me excited for more to come. \n* **Kokdu: Season of Deity (10/16)** \u2014 I've given up on this drama. Just watching it at 2x speed so I can be done with it quickly. \n* **Taxi Driver 2 (4/16)** \u2014 This season isn't as good as the first, it seems. The first season had a good blend of getting to know the victims, seeing how the leads react to the case, and then them getting into the meat of things to figure out just HOW bad things really are. This time, they put toooo much screen time for the second case, and the revenge didn't seem like it went along with the theme of the story. We saw these permanent characters more than we saw Shin Jae Ha or even the other leads.\n* **Crash Course in Romance (14/16)** \u2014 I had fun in both episodes, and that's mostly because I was watching while sharing my reaction to a new Reddit friend, who I've been non-stop talking with about this drama. Episode 14 was crazy. I typed in all-caps a lot. I lost my shit so many times. Can you believe we have 1 week left? Time passes by fast in this drama. My main verdict \u2014 Geon Hu supremacy. I love him so much.\n\nFor a memorable non-kdrama, I was watching Demon Slayer this week, and I reached season 1 episode 19. I cried. A lot. What a cool and emotional episode. I'm not into action, but this is such a great mix of action mixed with a battle of wits and figuring out your opponent. Other than that, the siblings are the highlight of this anime.",

I have to say that a lot of middle-aged men say that they consider the main character as their son/adoptive son. I have counted 6 since the biginning of the show. Ladies and gentlemen, you have seen the love triagle, now I introduce to you to the parental hexagon. Jokes aside, it is a pleasant show with some surprisingly good twists. \n\nWatching Joy of Life made me nostalgic for **Mr. Queen**. While the style of both shows is different, they are united by a cunning and extremely confident main lead who doesn't fit or belong in their time period. So, I ended up by cracking and now I am rewatching Mr. Queen (ep 6/20). \n\nAlso, I am watching **The Heavenly Idol** (4/12), which is still airing. The story is the peak of silliness and I love it this way. The execution aims more for cute than silly though. Overall, I find it light-hearted and fun.",

So many here on the subreddit guessed &gt;!that he was the culprit. I didn't want him to be it, either. But it subverted a trope of \"2nd leads (helpers to each of the MLs) get together.\" !&lt; I'm really going to miss this one. So now I have favorite romcoms for each year:  My Roommate is a Gumiho &amp; HTCCC,  Business Proposal, and this one. Hooray for kdrama Romcomland. \n\n**Love to Hate You:**  I watched this one because so many people on last week's \"What Are You Watching\" seemed to love it. After the first episode it picked up and I was hooked. I binged it in a couple of days, just as other have. This was compact and lovely. And bed scenes.... Is this because it was not broadcast on korean television?  I have only seen this in korean movies. Wow!\n\nRewatch of **Goblin** and **Gu Family Book:**  These are fine. My friend who has never seen Goblin is hooked and&gt;! last night the sword came out on the rooftop, ending the intense tears.  !&lt;  3 more episodes. The friend watching GFB with me was out of town so we didn't watch last week. \n\nI will pick up **Our Blooming Youth, The Heavenly Idol, My Liberation Notes** this week. I want to finish a few dramas before embarking on **Island.** \n\nThus far, my favorite dramas (that I've watched) of 2023 are **Curtain Call, If You Wish Upon Me, The Golden Spoon,** and **Crash Course in Romance.**  These are all Top Tier for me!",

We\u2019re almost halfway through and there is still not even a hint &gt;!why Min Jae-Yi\u2019s whole family was murdered and how it connects with events revolving the CP.!&lt; I like the main couple though, so I will keep watching.\n\n**Doom At Your Service (13/16)** I love this show so much and I\u2019m sad that I only have three episodes left. Although I\u2019m sobbing every other episode, this is my comfort show. I just love the tone and cinematography in this - it reminds me a lot of Goblin from the feel of it, but I think I prefer this over Goblin. \n\n**Call It Love (2/16)** Curious how this revenge plot will evolve! I like it so far. The ML reminds me a bit of the ML from _Because This Is My First Life_ with his rather cold demeanor and the fact that he had a devastating break up in the past. \n\n**Crash Course In Romance (14/16)** Guys, it\u2019s finale week! I\u2019m quite sure that we will get a happy ending, I just hope that the lawyer mum and the other one are getting some kind of character development and realize that they have to change in order to improve their relationship with their kids. And pleaaaase &gt;!give us wedding scenes!&lt; \n\n**Side Note** I got into kdramas last summer when I discovered a scene of _Extraordinary Attorney Woo_ on Tik Tok. Started binging this show and now I\u2019m on my 31st show lol. I was a strictly one show per time girl. But now with all the new exciting releases I can\u2019t help but juggle several dramas at the same time lol. No regrets though because I love the On Air discussions and I feel like a show has more impact on me if I have to wait a week between episodes. (Even if it\u2019s unbearable, I hated the wait for AOS)",

Would have worked better as a 12 episode story imo, drags in the middle a bit.\n\n*While you were sleeping* (10/16) Love it a lot. Maybe my recency bias but it's my top 5 kdrama of all time. Love the characters and love the story. The writing is phenomenal. The FL feels like a real person and so does the others. The side characters are also so good. Love the plots revolving around different cases. Also just wanted to mention, probably the best pilot episode of any kdrama, it was so well done it was a complete story in itself.",

            "comment": "Current:\r  \n**Crash Course in Romance** (14/16) \u2014 I can not wait for this one to be done! I have loved it intensely, even the episodes not everyone liked. This drama is so brilliant!\n\n**Call it Love** (4/16) \u2014 I like it! Except for the stupid pink filter. This is a super comforting melodrama though and the characters are great. Very interested in what is going to happen once the ML and FL get together and/or ML finds out FL\u2019s secrets. \n\n**Island** (6/12) \u2014 wanted to wait until part 2 was coming out before starting this one because I don't do cliffhangers well. This is a great watch - characters are fabulous - though I am annoyed as all hell with my Amazon. The subs are totally screwed up and poorly timed. Sometimes they work when I restart, and sometimes they don\u2019t. It\u2019s a good thing I actually know just enough Korean to be dangerous because without it the subs would be useless. I miss Viki subs. Oh and Cha Eun Woo has made this show worth watching for me. No other reason. \r\n\r\n**Jinny\u2019s Kitchen** (1/10) \u2014 I loved the first episode so much I called several non-Kdrama watchers and told them to watch it. They are hilarious together! Not that I expected anything else really. And I love that the screen text is in English as my Hangul reading skills are slow as shit at best, never mind understanding Korean. I\u2019m guessing that is an Amazon thing. Either way, it helped a great deal and I was able to truly enjoy the episode instead of rewinding a ton which I normally do for variety shows. This was so so worth the watch - I have seen it twice!\n\n**Hotel Del Luna** (12/16) \u2014 I like this! IU is brilliant, though I already knew that, and this story is interesting though sad. I expected nothing less. I love the FL and she makes it worth it.\n\n\nNon-Korean:\r  \n**My Beautiful Man season 2 or Utsukushii Kare** \u2014 Japanese BL \u2014 completed. I love this one! They are so cute together and I can\u2019t wait for the movie! \r  \n**The End of the World With You or Bokura no Micro na Shuumatsu** (5/8) \u2014 Japanese BL \u2014 What a show. It\u2019s so strange in so many ways. But it\u2019s a quick watch. I have seen several of the later episodes in Japanese, and I don\u2019t know Japanese, so I have an idea of what happens. The characters are different and it\u2019s a fun, dumb, little show. \n\n**Bed Friend** (2/8) \u2014 Thailand BL \u2014 NetJames \u2014 read the book and, wow, its a steamy, messy, story about friends with benefits that fall in love. Episode 2 had a ton of tension so that\u2019s nice. Music is weird, editing is weird, some plot points are weird. But it\u2019s a fun, steamy, little show.\n\n**Jack o\u2019Frost** (2/6) \u2014 Japanese BL \u2014 couple just breaks up when one has an accident and can\u2019t remember the other at all. So of course the one tries to win his partner back and make him fall in love again. Some great actors in this. Another sort of fluffy show but they are cute.\n\nNew season of **Mandalorian** starts today so that\u2019s got precedence over literally all else!\n\n\nOn Hold:\n\n**Kokdu: Season of Deity** (6/16) \u2014 No progress. Can\u2019t get into it at all for some reason. I keep being pulled by others. Will try again this next week maybe.\r  \n**Our Blooming Youth** (2/20) \u2014 Ditto but it\u2019s so slow and historical I have no idea when or if I can get back into it. Gonna try at some point.\n\n**The Heavenly Idol** (2/16) \u2014 I like this one so far. It's got an interesting premise - what a bizarre mash up of plot points. It's light and funny but I am having trouble getting into this one too. Maybe this next week like the others.",

            "comment": "I wanted to clear off some dramas I started a while ago but were put on hold for some reason, even though they intrigued me and I'm still invested in the stories. \n\n**Hyena** (16/16) - even though it's the more popular drama out of the two, there was also another [Hyena from 2006](https://mydramalist.com/2552-hyena) (and a [K-porn movie from 2020](https://mydramalist.com/64779-hyena)). The one I finished recently was the [2020 drama](https://mydramalist.com/36297-hyena) starring Kim Hye Soo and Ju Ji Hoon. \n\nLegal drama with corruption, collusion, and conspiracy as the main plot. I loved that both the leads were portrayed as morally grey people who were willing to get their hands dirty to get the bad guys. After introductions to the main players of the story in the first half (where I put the drama on hold), the later half was a lot more interesting when the consequences of their actions in the first half started to happen. Despite the poster, romance was not the focus though heavily hinted at every interaction. Satisfying end. Loved it!\n\n**Designated Survivor: 60 Days** (16/16). A friend was watching the American series and highly recommended it, so I started watching the Korean version instead lol. Ji Jin Hee was my main draw to the drama and I started watching for maybe half of ep 1 before I put it on hold a while ago. Picked it up again after I was done with Hyena, and wondered why I was even able to put it off for so long when it was this good! Got hooked right away and finished it in 3 days. \n\nIt started off like the American movie White House Down, but became more like The West Wing series with some conspiracies thrown in. If you want the Kdrama comparison, it started off like **D-Day** but with a bomb instead of an earthquake, and then the story developed more into **Chief of Staff** with a bit of **City Hunter** thrown in, minus the romance (okay there was a hint there but def not the focus). I don't like politics, I don't even understand most of what was being discussed in the drama. But I loved to see how the ML, who came from a more logical scientific background with no ambition for power, struggled and had to quickly learn everything he never understood about in such a short time. I loved that he dealt with issues in a logical and rational way, just like a scientist. Very refreshing take from the usual conniving and manipulative world of politics. He started off with barely anyone in his corner, to basically everyone, including the main bad guy, rooting for him. \n\nThere was a lot I loved about this drama, including my newfound thirst for Son Suk Ku lol. But unfortunately, I found the ending to be anti-climactic, especially considering the build-up and pacing of the drama. I guess I had too much hope for an epic ending and got disappointed when it never happened. It did end well and (almost) every loose end tied up, just not satisfying enough for me. Still highly recommend the drama and it will be on my to-rewatch list as well. \n\nNotable mentions from the drama:  \n* I watched **Mr Queen** before DS:60Days and was pleasantly surprised to see [Bae Jong Ok](https://mydramalist.com/people/2016-bae-jong-ok) went from the screeching Grand Dowager Queen to a morally (somewhat) good politician. Still a queen, just less screeching and more calmly a badass.  \n* [Heo Joon Ho](https://mydramalist.com/people/9500-heo-joon-ho) had been perpetually ingrained in my mind as a deranged serial killer from **Come and Hug Me**, so I got a whiplash seeing him as the adoring father and caring partner in **Missing: The Other Side**, to then now as the charismatic and calculative presidential staff in DS:60Days. Versatile actor indeed. \n\nOther dramas I watched this past week:  \n* **Taxi Driver 2** (4/16) - still the highlight for me every weekend.  \n* **No Activity** (Jdrama 6/6) - Japanese remake of the Aussie series. Silly drama with no point in it at all. Luckily it was short.  \n* **The Heavenly Idol** (4/12) - possibly dropping this. \n\nNow the dilemma is whether to start watching other Ji Jin Hee's dramas or Son Suk Ku's.\n\nEdit: format.",

But the first episode shattered me when I first watched it so I stopped. Then I had amnesia and started watching from the first episode again, and had my heart shattered all over again. I need to steel my heart a bit more for my 3rd attempt (and maybe watch from ep 2 instead). Were the rest of the episodes not sad? If ep 1 was an indication of how the rest would go, I need to prep myself. \n\nThinking of watching **Undercover** next for more Ji Jin Hee. But need a break first, since it seems quite similar to DS:60Days and I don't want to confuse the two later. \n\nHeo Joon Ho was super creepy as a serial killer. It took a few episodes of seeing him in Missing to convince me he wasn't the bad guy after all. I kept expecting him to bring out a hammer whenever something intense was about to happen.",

But some politics since the king is a main role.\n\n\nIt throws me off when I see a character who I know the actor from being really nice, trustworthy in another drama and then he is a scumbag in the one I'm watching. The other way around, too. Totally get what you mean with Heo Joon Ho!",

I'm not usually that into period dramas but I thought this show was excellent. I loved the costumes and the sets, and the characters had lots of mystery. One of my fav parts of it was the side characters, like the translators, servants, and the two guys from anything you want. They were all so funny! I could watch a whole show with just them. I'd also love a spinoff of Hina Kudo!\n\nStarted **Weightlifting fairy kim bok-joo** ep03. Another one I didn't expect to enjoy this much. I love how over-the-top everyone's mannerisms are.

It's still a very watchable drama but I wish more time had been spent on the relationship development between the leads and some found-family moments.\n\n(Japan) **First Love** (3/9) - Not a fan of Japanese shows but the preview on Netflix looked compelling. It's a heavy and angsty romance. Need lots of breaks while watching this one. Also, one thing that keeps taking me out is that the ML and FLs younger selves look nothing like them. The young FLs face is much bigger that the old FL and the young ML's face is smaller that the old ML. For a show that has a lot of attention to detail, these are weird casting choices.\n\n(China) **Love Between Fairy and Devil** (7/36) - The  first few episodes had too much world building but it's got interesting now. \n\n(Thailand) **Moonlight Chicken** (6/8) - One of the most mature and angsty BLs I've watched. The characters are flawed and relationship dynamics very relatable. Will be sad to say bye to this one when it ends tomorrow.\n \n(Thailand) **Bed Friend** (2/8) - As spicy as it's name. The leads have explosive chemistry and their skinship game is another level. They are hard carrying this BL, and how!",

I think it's going to end up being one of my favorites! Did you watch My School President with Gemini and Fourth? It's a much lighter, fluffier tone, but still so good.\n\n&gt;(Thailand) **Bed Friend** (2/8) - As spicy as it's name. The leads have explosive chemistry and their skinship game is another level.

I tried watching MSP but dropped it after 4 episodes. It just didn't work for me and I have no idea why coz I loved a similar I Will Knock You.\n\nAbout Bed Friend, it's one of those shows where you turn off your brain and just enjoy the chemistry \ud83d\ude04",

It was kind of like watching a really good high school movie, like a \"Can't Hardly Wait.\" A romcom, but with characters that felt fleshed out and real.\n\nBed Friend is definitely a turn your brain off show. It's not quite as ridiculous as UN (God I miss UN and the on-air threads!) but it's still good, fun trash.",

This has been such a pleasurable, cosy watch.\n\nTaxi Driver- Season 2 - So satisfying to see baddies get their just desserts, just like in Season 1. Always rewind and watch again the scenes where Lee Je Hoon singlehandedly defeats foes with a few well-executed kicks and punches. It makes me laugh though because IRL he's probably the antithesis of a lethal vigilante Kim Do Ki. If you've seen him in the reality show Traveler, backpacking around Cuba with Ryu Jun Yeol, he's very unassuming and a bit shy and kinda comical when he's trying to give away extra kimchi to various Cubans hosts. Sweet and goofy.\n\nUh oh, Shin Jae Ha has been hired as a new driver at the taxi company. Since he plays the &gt;!disturbed killer!&lt; assistant in Crash Course in Romance, I'm &gt;!on edge and suspecting he's up to no good here as well.!&lt;\n\nLove to Hate You - a good show with likeable leads with 12 episodes. Light, easy, fun.\n\nHeavenly Idol - a brilliant premise: an ascended being who has to make it in the cutthroat Kpop world and relies on &gt;!turbo charging his divine power with candy and caffeine!&lt;. I'm at episode 4, and so far so good. \n\nI'm Sorry, I Love You - haven't progressed after episode 1 because this 2004 drama has portents of terrible sadness. So Ji Sub and Im Soo Jung are portraying their characters well, but I will dive back in in once I square my shoulders for some of that gut wrenching, han-centric narrative. Given his mesmerizing presence and iconic face, So Ji Sub will be the carrot . . . .",

With the latest non-surprising, unmotivated thriller plotline coming into fruition, and the bad guy exactly who I thought it would be from ep 1, this is nothing more than Crazy Love, with better acting but less funny. Leads do what they can, their chemistry has improved even, but secondaries are painful and all adult storylines complete whiffs. Promising, disappointing, average;\n\n\\- **Kokdu, Season of Deity (10/16):** does it make sense? Not always. Still, I'm having a blast watching KJH and all his acting skills on display, even ISH is growing on me although her character is pretty flat. Plot holes, unbalanced pacing, but all in all a lot of entertainment value without trying to do too much.

            "comment": "**Kokdu: Season of Deity** (10/16) With the murder subplot ramping up as FL's little brother gets deeper into his investigation, I like how the drama is treating the issue/idea of the 'worth' and 'worthiness' of a (human) life. The story here reminds me of NWABU where a bulk of it is about a person learning to move *onwards* past what had happened. It's a melancholy story wrapped up in romcom tropes and I love it.\n\n**Island Part 2** (2/6) Jeju scenery remains gorgeous but my emotional investment in the story and characters is dipping towards none. It's not a fluffy drama but I'm watching it like it's fluff.\n\n**Dream High** (Rewatch, 12/16) Jason and his *manners*! It's been a while since I've watched something this *earnest* and loving it because seeing the kids go for their dreams is so easy to root and cheer for.\n\n**Cruel Temptation** (94/129) I've hit the stretch where revenge is being served but it doesn't feel enough. I can't really stand FL's birth family gloating about their current 'success' because they did so little to earn/contribute to it -- which has definitely reduced the satisfaction of seeing the FL serve up revenge to all those that wronged her. For me though, I feel like FL's birth family wronged her the *most* yet she's of course being filial instead. *sigh*\n\n**Witch's Game** (90/120) Ahahaha the writer has no clue what to write anymore and we've been spinning in circles for so long now. Pity since it started off *so well*.\n\n**Delivery Man** (1/12) This just started and I enjoyed the premiere. Excited to see where it goes.\n\n**Three-Body** (Chinese, 30/30) Just finished this last night and it was *intense*. Production values were some of the best I've seen and now all the rumors about its budget size makes sense. It's one of the most cerebral dramas I've come across (possibly because my physics suck) and I enjoyed its philosophical musings. The dialogue delivery of this drama is top notch, so often everything comes down to the tone in which the dialogue is delivered. I loved the interrogations of Dr. Ye near the end, especially when she was asked if &gt;!her conclusion was scientific!&lt;, I don't think a more perfect scene can be made. The ending felt *just right* for me, enough spirit and enough openness to conclude this epic sci-fi saga.\n\n**A League of Nobleman** (3/29) Started this and while the story seems interesting, the acting is making me cringe a tiny bit. While I'm generally in the camp of enjoying actors doing their own dubs, I really wish they'd had the two MLs dubbed by some of the more experienced voice actors. It's my first time seeing both Jing Bo Ran and Song Wei Long in dramas and I'm so not impressed.",

Felt like the FL interacted with the SML more. In Good job Kwon Yuri\u2019s wardrobe changes was carrying this show and they stopped doing them later in the show, the plot also was annoying. Lots of time wasted with these two shows. On the first episode of a C Drama called Fall in Love with Zhang Jing Yi. Dont watch CDramas much but the 2 I watched the leads had immaculate chemistry comparable with the best KDramas.",

Got 4 episodes left for each.\n\nFirst time watching a kdrama with a friend, and also first time watching a kdrama as it comes out!!! The waiting is like a beautiful kind of sadness\n\nMost obsessed with Mr. Sunshine - though the pace isn't always what I want it to be, the historical era and the characters have really grown on me.",

            "comment": "I'm juggling a bit of a strange mix.\n\nI started Bad and Crazy. Lee Dong Wook and Wi Ha Joon are both awesome in this. The production that went into it is great. It's a wild, flashy way of telling a story about a conflicted, slightly corrupt cop. \n\nI also started Born Again. (I had to put my Netflix sub on hold for a few days because money, so I needed to temporarily replace B&amp;C). I was not prepared for the emotions with Born Again \n\nThis drama is emotionally intense. There is some pretty heart wrenching child abuse in episode two. I highly recommend fast forwarding through that. I didn't realize this before starting it, but it's roughly inspired by Wuthering Heights. I hate Wuthering Heights. Other than the child abuse, and despite the Wuthering Heights, I'm engaged in the drama. Lee Soo Hyuk plays a very likeable and sweet character. Jang Ki Yong plays an incredibly compelling character, and plays him really well. I'm already highly invested in this drama, and I've barely started it.",

I\u2019m not ready for the show to end, and am going to really miss it when it\u2019s over. It\u2019s one of my favorite shows I\u2019ve watched in quite a while.\n\n**Alchemy of Souls** (17/20): I\u2019m enjoying this show, but, for me it hasn\u2019t quite reached the level of something that I just can\u2019t stop watching, like with my favorite shows. Lee Jae-wook is really great in this. \n\nCompleted:\n\n**I Hear Your Voice**: I\u2019d held off on watching this because of some of the surface similarities to While You Were Sleeping, which I really loved. I ended up really liking this one too, though. It\u2019s a moving story about truth, justice, doing what\u2019s right even when it\u2019s hard. The show had well developed three dimensional characters. I liked the FL and her growth throughout the show. I also liked the relationship between the leads. This was a show where I also really liked the supporting characters. I, maybe, wish there was a little more romance, but accept that wasn\u2019t totally the focus of the show.",

Not indulging my need to binge, but that's probably healthy.\n\n**Familiar Wife** (8/16)- engaging. really enjoying it.\n\n**Live** (15/18)- watching this slowly, while I workout (35 minutes at a time). It's moving and really good.\n\n**Doctor Stranger** (1/20)- just started this yesterday (needed a Lee Jong Suk fix). Only one episode in and I'm hooked.\n\nCurrently Airing:\n\n**Crash Course in Romance** (13/16)- loving it. Would binge if it weren't still airing.\n\n**Kokdu: Season of Deity** (9/16)- this is adorable. I really like the ML so it's fun watching him.\n\n**Our Blooming Youth** (8/20)- I am enjoying this, but admittedly keep confusing plotlines with Poong. Still, I'm in.\n\n**Heavenly Idol** (4/12)- It's good. I like the ML and FL and like the freshness of the concept, though the Christianity-like religious aspect is a bit much at times.",

I'm especially liking seeing an \\*older\\* couple behaving maturely in a relationship.\n\nLove in Contract 14/16: GKP is a delight as always and so nuanced. PMY is fun in romcoms but I find sometimes when things get a bit serious, she resorts to the same expressions or defaults to pulling a face. I find she can lack the gravitas needed for a scene, if that makes sense? The fits on this show are sublime.\n\nShopaholic Louis 2/16: I really like SIG but the aesthetic of this show is lacking ... it was shot in 2016 and looks so dated the way they colour corrected this show. I will slowly work my way through this though!",

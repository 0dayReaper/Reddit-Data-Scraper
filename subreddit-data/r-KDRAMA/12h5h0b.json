    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nAs we approach 500k subscribers r/KDRAMA is a big sub with a small sub feel. To maintain the safe space we have and cherish, we need to expand our mod team so we are looking to recruit a few users to join our team in the near future.\n\nThis time around we are specifically looking for a range of people with different tastes and watch histories to focus mostly on approving and removing comments. One of our goals is to recruit more mods to cover more dramas so that we can moderate spoilers effectively and in a more timely manner. \n\nWe are also hoping we get some more eyes in our regular threads too so that possible problems are spotted before things get ugly. Thus just generally browsing on-air discussions and FFAs to check the health of our community discourse will also be an important duty. \n\n**Content Moderator Duties**\n\nThe role of content moderators is pretty simple (most of the time) - approving and removing content, redirecting content to the correct area of our subreddit or an alternate subreddit, and setting the correct flairs on posts. \n\nTo be an effective content moderator, you need to be familiar with our subreddit Rules and Policies. Please review them before applying.\n\nYou do not need to have prior Reddit mod experience, we will provide training.\n\nYou do need to have a history of positive engagement in our subreddit.\n\nAnd you have to be okay with spoilers because you will encounter spoilers. (We warned you!)\n\n**Expected Time Commitment**\n\nContent moderators are **not** expected to devote large chunks of time in one sitting to moderation, rather the expectation is that you will check the mod queue for a few minutes whenever possible to approve permissible content and remove rule-breaking comment. As new mods you can even just focus on only approving obviously permissible comments and leave any doubtful items in the queue. As such, even small spurts of 5 minutes of moderation twice a day can be useful and helpful.\n\nWe do not have a minimum requirement for amount of time spent moderating per week *but* we do expect moderation activity on a weekly basis. And while we recognize that Real Life^TM obviously takes precedence over Reddit moderating so we are happy to work with schedule changes, if you cannot commit to actively moderating on a weekly basis, please do not apply.\n\n**Some Warnings**\n\nIf you become a mod, you ***will*** be seeing the worst this community has to offer because that's the kind of content that does make it into the mod queue (though hopefully not very often). Even if as newbie mods you will not be expected to moderate such content or deal with those users, you will be exposed to it. It can and likely will take a toll on your emotional and mental health -- that's just part of being a moderator so if you are not in a good place, don't apply.\n\nIf you become a mod, you will be seeing comments about sexual assault in the mod queue -- this is an area of discourse that we moderate tightly because of the potential for abuse. If seeing such content will be triggering for you, don't apply.\n\nAnd again, if you become a mod, you will encounter (lots of) spoilers. If that's a dealbreaker for you, don't apply.    \n\n**Requirements:**\n\n* Discord Account -- The mod team communicates via a Discord server so you must have a Discord account or be willing to get one. (Easy and free, though the app itself may take some getting used to.)\n\n* Reddit Account In Good Standing -- We require applicants to have a Reddit account of at least 8 months old (as of May 1, 2023) and in good standing (no suspended or shadowbanned accounts).\n\n* 18+ In International Age -- The age limit is for your sanity (yes we\u2019re pulling the age card here), no teenager needs the stress of moderating a subreddit.\n\n**How To Apply:**\n\nTo apply to be a moderator, please [fill out this application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJdNBODZwrO3VV6J6JkycWDdF5BwUsCEOZtHGwxOZ4wjXw0w/viewform?usp=sf_link).\n\nApplications will be open for the next 4 weeks. We anticipate onboarding new mods no later than July 2023.\n\nPrevious applicants who fulfil the above requirements are welcome to apply again.\n\n**Got Questions/Concerns?**\n\nHave any questions or concerns? Leave a comment. The mod team will be monitoring this post.",

When I read the synopsis, I thought it will be a serious melodrama because the male lead is supposed to be a secret agent so this is a surprise. \n\nHopefully the teaser is the same as the main drama. Because I remember Hi!Bye!Mama had a funny teaser then when the actual drama came out, it was just a cryingfest LOL",

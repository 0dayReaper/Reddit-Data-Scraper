He's not just... straight up stopping the practice of law right? That'd make things.. in some scenarios, awfully inconvenient. \n\nSo excited to learn more about the Jeonmok Kids!

Roum is kinda winning so far in showing Mooyoung that the world is not black and white and he cant do much by being so uptight. but Mooyong is also outsmarting Roum in the mission to save Ringo. the fact that she is willing to let the teenagers go even tho in her own words that it's annoying lol. Cant wait to see two of them actually on the same page but trying to influence each other. if there's a romance, I hope they can build it properly bcs one is over emphatic while the other in unemphatic. make them suddenly fall for each other, esp Roum, will be so unbelievable.\nDajeong is the coolest the way that she stands up to Roun and telling her that Mooyoung is kind n nice person while roum thinks he's crazy. the rating is picking up as well. I hope more people will watch this one!",

I feel director doesn't really know how to play with this convention and it doesn't suit Chun Woo-Hee's style of acting as well.\n\n Breaking fourth wall looks the best with naturally very expressive actors (often comedians) because it is very easy for them highlight when they behave as character and when directly talk to viewers. But here there is almost no difference between 2 parts and viewer only understand that because Chun Woo-Hee looks directly at us. I'm pretty sure that without sound most viewers would not be aware that she is breaking fourth wall in most scenes.It is also pretty awakrawd that she does that mostly in swindling scenes. Editing is not the best.",

I used to buy the dvd saving up my daily allowance and then requested it to the dvd shopkeeper for some certain drama and finger crossed the disc would work lol. And I also made friends trough it, like if I haven\u2019t got the particular drama and I really want to watch it, I\u2019ll try to find someone who owns it and exchanged my collections with her/his.

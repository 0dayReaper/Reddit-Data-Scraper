Yeon Jin does twisted things without consequence because her mom nurtured this kind of behaviour. Herself and Sa Ra could have potentially been better people if their parents took more time to teach them proper values (or in short, if they didn't have parents who were shitty people). Sometimes it confused me how someone as deranged as Yeon Jin's mom could exist to begin with.\n\nNature on the other hand, Dong Eun has a clear moral compass even though her mom is.....well...barely there, and clearly has her own issues with alcohol/substance abuse. Ye Sol seems to have \"inherited\" Do Yeong's righteous moral compass. Joo Yeo Jeong is probably the winner here because he also grew up in a loving family and seems to be naturally good. His issues only started to appear after his father's death and that awful killer kept sending him letters",

I'm still not entirely sure she was right. Obviously in her revemge both do yeong and ye sol were very hurt. Do yeong discovered the truth about his wife and his daughter and I'd assume his reputation was possibly harmed as well. Ye sol lost her mother, but maybe more importantly, the image of the perfect mother. Dong eun obviously knew that they would be hurt in some way. So did dong eun did do yeong and ye sol a \"favour\" by hurting them in the short term but exposing yeon jin for the monster she is? Or would it have been better for thrm to stay in the dark?

His character is ambiguous at times (which only makes him even more interesting!) and there are scenes in which shows his rich-man background prejudice, such as the way he gifted the wine to his driver or the handbag to Hye Jeong. When he described the reason for choosing YeonJin as his wife, it also shows that he only sees her as a trophy wife and she also accepted it as thus. In fact, Hye Jeong describe him quite accurately in Episode 7, calling him a \"nice son of a bitch\". Do Yeong toes the line between good and bad. He does have a moral compass which puts him in a different group from the bullies who are just plain evil. \n\nI think this is important because none of the main characters in the drama are inherently good or upright. All of them are willing to do bad things, whether it is just for their own fun (like the bullies) or for revenge (like Dong Eun). Therefore, I don't consider Do Yeong as stained by murdering Jae Jun. Based on his personality, it's quite clear that he was capable of shady things even before meeting Dong Eun.\n\nAnyway, Do Yeong is definitely my favorite character, and the reason I watch the drama. It's interesting to decipher his words and actions which are not always straightforward and can be open to interpretations.",

This show is going into my personal hall of fame.\n\nOne of the rare occasions, when I actually wished there were couple of more episodes to show &gt;!Joo Yeo Jung getting his revenge too, but not too dragged out. No other season needed.!&lt;\n\nEverything about the show was perfection, gut wrenching at times, but perfect nonetheless. The pacing was *chef's kiss*. I mean they have set the bar for what a solid revenge story can be.\n\nI just can't say enough and am not as articulate as some of the members in this sub. But all the praises I am reading, the analysis of different characters, such as  Doyeong. &gt;!When Yesol ran into his arms while crying and screaming \"appa\", just hit so hard. Love that kid.!&lt; I agree with it all, you just put words to my thoughts.\n\nHands down, one of the GOAT K-drama and show I have ever watched.",

I felt that she (I watched it a while ago so I can't remember the names, sorry!) was way too forceful and pushing, and he was mostly trying to avoid her. More than her behaviour I didn't like the show's portrayal of her behaviour as cute or quirky. I think that if a male character would behave the same he would be labeled as a creep and that's that.\n\nIt's still a nice concept for a show though. I like emotionally vulnerable stories and characters. To u/linonihon, I'd recommend Mad For Each Other, it's also a story of two emotionally vulnerable and \"weird\" people, but I absolutely loved how they supported each other throughout",

It's held this spot for 2 weeks now.\n\n\\- As of March 19, The Glory has had about **450 million viewing hours** (all numbers are rounded up.)  In terms of Korean content and hours viewed, **Squid Game** of course holds Netflix's all-time record with **2.2 billion** hours followed by **2. All Of Us Are Dead** at **660 million+** hours and then **3. Extraordinary Atty Woo** at **650** **million+**.\n\nIt'll be fascinating to see if **The Glory** will reach or surpass *600-700 million views within the next few weeks.*\n\n\\- In terms of being No. 1 in countries, **The Glory** is at practically the same level as Squid Game and AOUD. The Glory has reached **Top 10 in** ***91*** **countries -** similar levels as SG and AOUD **(Top 10 in** ***94*** **countries.) Atty Woo**, already a phenomenal hit, reached **Top 10 in 57 countries**. Out of curiosity, I checked **Hometown Cha Cha** and it reached **Top 10 in 40 countries**.\n\nThis confirms my view that **The Glory** has drawn a huge audience of non-typical K Drama watchers. To compare, Netflix's record breaking hits of all time like **Stranger Things** and **Bridgerton** are also within the \"**Top 10 in 90-93 countries**\" range. Highly impressive that The Glory is at that level.",

They are losing many customers in the US who rely on them for English language shows because so many of those shows migrated back to the companies that originally made them. They have invested in buying the rights to kdramas because folks who watch kdrama sign up and keep the service longer.",

Maybe they add/count the viewing hours that people put in to rewatch the previous shows before the new ones come out?",

Netflix will scoop them up and release all at once after filming and editing is finished because they became popular. but often if very popular before finishing they will start showing before all episodes are finished and eventually you are watching them weekly as well. I just finished one like that.   It was a Chinese drama that became wildly popular and when Netflix scooped it, I watched 16 episodes binging and then waited as 3 episodes dropped a week to finish the 36 episodes.  If Netflix is the one who starts the drama and owns it, I have seen them do two a week.  It is only some that they choose to do a large break between episodes.  And I don\u2019t know why the difference.  I hate it.  Because I can\u2019t remember what happened and have to go back and watch. And the hype still builds up if they hold off and let loose all at once or if they do weekly showings.  Since I have loved the few they did the big break with, next time I will wait until the second half are released and watch it then.  The break is two months and that is ridiculous. To me.",

I didn't want Dong-eun to look like a heroine. I wanted to show there are victims who can break away from them. I thought that would make it sadder. (Caption: Gyeong-ran was locked up by assailants) Gyeong-ran could never imagine the world outside of the room she was locked inside.

There are little touches of answers, leaving plenty gaps for viewer to fill.\n\nYoure right, i didnt see much in the way of the guys, and how they became so awful. But like yeonjin, probably really down to too much privilege!\n\nIn terms of sara, drug addiction is a disease and it can just be a genetic predisposition. However if you look to the parents, they didnt fulfull any emotional care for her. Remember they were too concerned with their image to really get her treated. So what would that have been like growing up?. It would be so easy for a girl who lived with the means to buy it, hanging out with friends with no conscience, to get her hands on it too.\n\nGyeongran was afraid of them. She stayed in an abusive environment, it became normslised to her and she definitely had unprocessed trauma, eg with the rape(s). I feel so sad that she spent do much of her life under their thumb\n\nHyejeong, was a little bit the same. I think a mix of fear that it would have been her if she had not joined in with them (sara told her that i think a bunch of times). But also opportunism.. i think she felt some of it would rub off on her. As soon as she saw she could come out on top she really didnt hesitate to take action and use her info against them. She even ditched her carefully crafted rich marriage plans. I think her story was really one of the most tragic because she was so close to being a comfortable rich wife.  But \"if you wallow with pigs, expect to get dirty\".",

It would change the narrative bent of The Glory though and it would lose it's identity. The Glory.\n\n\"Why did Jaejoon, Hyejeong And other bullies become bullies? \"\nJaejoon's mother played a role; she was a matchmaker for women to rich men using the shaman for guidance.  Jaejoon had a mistrust for people with O's in their name; superstition.  The need to use other's as stepping stones and to have fun with people who weren't up to snuff in their eyes.  I think a family where everyone shits on you just with their perceptions or ignoring is a good example on how people's self worth is established and this show is about regaining that platform by using the bullies as stepping stones for glory and becoming the beyond the law using morality as path.\n\n\"I\u2019d love to see how Hyejeong and Myeong Oh stuck around these so-called friends while simultaneously impress but hate the group by pretending she\u2019s high class while being lower class. \"\n\nToxic relationships tend to sustain especially as they imbibed in the bullying together hence karmic effect as their lives went on.  You see when they're adults all their differences put aside initially once they see their old target show up in the gym again too but fracture even moreso once they feel pressured.\n\n\n\"How did Sara become such a drug addict lmao? Picked up habits from abroad? \" \n\n I think that narrative detail they leave to the audiences imagination but toxic friendships I think are the general reason. \n\n\"SOHEES PREGNANCY LINE omg how can they just drop \u201cyea she was pregnant and then she was killed. Next!!\u201d ??? This would\u2019ve changed so much how Jaejoong saw Yeonjin\"  \nMaybe or maybe not if baby not HIS.  I think the only one knowing the full truth on Sohee was the mother (kept her nametag for blackmail purposes against own daughter), detective the mother kept in pocket, and her daughter.  This was a closely kept s3cret no one buy the witness in the alley was aware of; through sheer coincidence of course this was the next bullying victim.  Coincidence and realism are secondary to narrative in this show but narrative is so good I can set that aside.\n\n\"why did Gyeongran stay working for the bullies? And even going so far to live in freaking boutique? What\u2019s that about LMFAO\"\nFinancial limitations as well as scarring personal development wise from the bullying she endured she knew her place.  These were the upper level people and she didn't fit in with her peers hence given an opportunity work at store for prestigious clothing line and they kept her cause they had worked on her so had that superiority aspect the bullies were after.  A toxic family get together people still go to where people always treated by their self worth in the eyes of their family another example like why not just cut them off and tell them off permanent is another example.",

Plus I could have done with more Sa-Ra and Choi Hye-jeong because they were great and really nailed their performances. Really hope Kim Hieora in particular gets a more major roll at some point as she's had such amazing screen presence in everything I've seen her in.\n\nOtherwise a great show. There were a few moments I thought it got a little too long which meant it had to depend on the antagonists repeatedly being a little too incompetent, especially once they knew about Moon Dong Eun.

Whilst Do-yeong occupied a somewhat similar space and was so much more interesting both in character and his relationship to Dong-eun.\n\nI'm going to have to disagree. Joo yeo jung was anything but boring. His character brought to  the story and moon dong eun what was actually needed. I find it baffling that he was so 'uncompelling' compared to the stellar performance he gave.",

                            "comment": "Completely agree. I am in the minority when I say I like the pairing of Dong eun and Yeo jeong. They suit each other more than Do young and Dong eun. Do young has one sided crush/love for Dong eun while Dong eun actually has feelings for Yeo jeong. They're supposed to be awkward because one is scarred for life both physically and emotionally and never has known love. The other is head over heels in love with her for years and has no problem being honest and open with his feelings. As for looks, they could have made him look slightly less boyish and Dong eun younger with long hair but then again Dong eun is supposed to look matured more than others because of her trauma and hardwork. \n\nMy only gripe is that Yeo Jeong could have been more integrated into the story. Both the actor and his character has so much potential. I was waiting for him to kick asses, show his inner ruthless side more. His past could have been more linked to the Dong Eun's. Or his quest for revenge could be more justified. Like how the psycho killer and according to his mom, also a rapist, raped and murdered his friends or sisters along with killing his dad and now he's roaming free or that he'll be released. Hence he needs to personally avenge him. That would make for a nice follow up second season. Now Dong Eun and he preparing to exact revenge on an already sentenced psycho killer in a jail seems weak. They could have paid for inmates to torture and kill him.",

One of my favourite scenes in the show was where he gifted his driver the expensive wine which would usually be seen as a really kind act. But he goes out of the way to make the gift look like garbage. He pulls back the veil that ultimately this super expensive and luxury product is no different materially from any $5 dollar wine so the gift is nothing to him and should also be nothing for his driver. Which extends to Go, for him it's just a game to be good at, where as for Moon Dong it's significance is solely down to how it's an allegory for her life's work.\n\nI don't even think Do Yeong's particularly toxic next to the rest of the cast. He see's how he's benefitted from a unjust system, see's how utterly terrible his peers are, but when somebody seeks to try to tear those peers down to him it's just an amusement. Something he'll sit on the fence with and think he's playing both sides but ultimately his choices will never go beyond his own self interest. It's no different to Go where the only thing he cares about is being a game to win. He was ultimately just a supercilious prick who was still a way better influence for his daughter than anybody else involves. To me he was just a really well realised and believable character.\n\nJoo Yeo Jung just had none of that depth for me. I didn't buy the relationship. I though his origin of his trauma was one of the more cartoonish aspects of the show. And I think anything his arc touched on Moon Dong's arc covered with way more meaning.",

I rewatch his scenes the most often because of the ambiguity of his actions and words where on surface level, it might make him look good, but in actual there's a streak of prejudice and meanness in it. I love how Hye Jyeong described him : a nice son of a bitch. He's my favorite character simply because the screenwriter really brought depth and dimension to the character. Which is funny since he is just a supporting character who does not have alot of screentime, but whenever he is there, there is always something interesting to watch. Yeo Jung on the other hand failed as a character - very boring and one-dimension. And it really doesn't help that the actor portraying Yeo Jung did not do a good job. Some of his facial expressions just look weird and out of place.",

As a crime/suspense/revenge genre fan, I found the first 8 eps to be compelling, but the last 8 not so much. If they had removed the Dr Joo character, it wouldn\u2019t seem like Dong-eun needed a handsome wealthy Prince after all to support &amp; finance her revenge efforts.  I even thought they\u2019d draw a chilling parallel between the senior Dr Joo\u2019s killer with Yeon-jin \u2026 both being psychopaths.  Alas, the whole Joo Yeo-jung plot-line plus his revenge motivations just seemed out of place, and entirely convenient to amp up the romance factor. Lee Do-hyun (while his acting can\u2019t be faulted) was just wasted in that role.",

His chemistry with Dong-eun may have not seemed so lackluster if there wasn't already Do-yeong. Do-yeong and Dong-eun's intellectual seduction scenes were so captivating.\n\nI think it would have made for a tighter story for Dong-eun to have learned baduk and teamed up with Yeojung's mother (Sang-im). I personally would delete Yeojung from the story entirely and have Sang-im be the one grappling with her husband's death alone. OR I would have Yeojung be the one who was murdered and his mom be his only parental figure. I think thematically, Dong-eun and Sang-im teaming up would make more sense, as Dong-eun finds a maternal figure who will help her in revenge.\n\nBecause the thing is, Dong-eun doesn't seem emotionally available for a romantic relationship yet, but she does need someone to treat her with warmth and an unconditional love.",

When he belittled his driver, it just didn\u2019t seem like he\u2019d be the type to watch his reputation and \u201cperfect\u201d family crumble so quickly.  \n\nYour alternative for Sang-im\u2019s role (and removing Yeo-jung) is so much more in line with the drama\u2019s female-centric themes.  It would\u2019ve made so much more sense for Dong-eun to want to rely on a maternal figure (given how she was betrayed by her own birth mother) as well as having Hyeon-nam (the stand-in aunt).  But without a romantic love-line, I suspect this drama would lose at least 90% of its current fan base.",

                    "comment": "The series really did play out like a game of baduk to me, I loved it (I\u2019m amateur 1-dan player).\n\nWhen analysing any game of baduk/go we can split it into 3 phases including the opening, the mid-game, and the endgame. \n\nThe opening is preparing for mid-game fights, carefully planning laying down foundations that will favour future battles. Depending on the style of player, how it\u2019s played can vary greatly. In The Glory episode 13, Joo Yeo-Jeong speaks with Ha Do-Yeong about Dong-Eun\u2019s play style. The English subtitles actually did not translate the technical baduk/go terms that were used\u2026 Yeo-Jeong says that Dong-Eun is good at \u201csticking\u201d (\u7c98) and \u201cturning\u201d (\u62d0) which are both very safe and solid (but not fast) ways of playing; ie very patient, doesn\u2019t look aggressive, but playing safe, leaving no weakness, but eventually \u201cyour house is in ruins\u201d and it\u2019s too late to do anything to save it. This reflects her way of getting her revenge.\n\nIn the middle episodes, is a series of back and forth \u201cattacks\u201d by Dong-Eun and Yeon-Jin, which felt like a real game. There\u2019s a concept in Baduk/Go that we call a \u201ctrade\u201d or \u201cexchange\u201d ie one can never win everything, and often you need to make trades as long as you get profit (which side profits is often not apparent at the moment, at least to the weaker player). One such instance was Dong-Eun\u2019s mom (a move by Yeon-Jin) getting her removed from the school by destroying her reputation\u2026 Dong-Eun \u201clost\u201d that play but actually she already burned most of what she wanted to achieve with that school teacher position already and then used the opportunity to put her mom into a psychiatric institution. So it was a good trade.\n\nNear the end game, who ever has the most territory and the \u201csafest\u201d groups will win, and all weaknesses are revealed and \u201creaped\u201d \u6536\u5b98 in the endgame. Everything just plays out naturally as a result from the battles in the mid game. The last 2 episodes were the reaping.\n\nA side note, \u201csente\u201d ie \u201cfirst hand\u201c is also mentioned, which literally means you are playing the first move forcing subsequent moves by the opponent, and it was mentioned that Do-Yeung hates losing the initiative and being forced to be in \u201cgote\u201d, ie only responding to the opponents moves.",

It's almost like they outdid each other. I loved the romance of Dong Eun and Yeo Jeong. Wish they explored more of Yeo Jeong's character or at least his character is more tied to the story. His revenge plot is weak. I think a episode or two is enough so I don't see another season for this show.\n\nThe time periods switch is confusing. Wish they had different looks and styling to differentiate. It was also difficult to remember faces with their names during the first watch. Second time viewing cleared that up. The translations, imo, didn't do justice. There are some technicalities ignored and plotholes. Like right people appearing at the right time. For eg: Yeo Jeong's mom on roof top with Dong eun. \n\nThe monologues of Dong Eun were so insightful and resonated with me. This is my second kdrama. And what a good drama this is!

His father didn't help Dong-eun back then, and slapped her a few times. But that's all. I don't find any solid reason for his son to not give his father his medicine.!&lt;\n2. &gt;!What happened in that road accident that killed Mr.Lee? The car was speeding, and from her panic reaction, it's quite sure Yeon-jin's mom wasn't intentional. But whether or not it was her intention or Dong-eun's, it's still impossible to time that hit. Mr.Lee was sober at that moment &amp; he was certainly not a toddler who didn't know how to cross a street.!&lt; \nSo, what gives?",

In the flashbacks, Mr. Kim bragged about his son going to a prestigious school, getting good grades etc. and Dongeun was shown to be part of a student society where he was the president too. IMO, the way his character was set up was to depict him as someone with a solid reputation, so my thought was from this perspective, he had a lot to loose with his father's past coming back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso in that episode, he had received many celebratory wreathes. Might be a bit of a reach but I guess this 'death by flowers' shows the irony of Mr. Kim and his obsession with status, when that would be the very thing which causes his death.",

The revenge because it isn\u2019t makjang level ott but within the realm of reality, which should give some hope to others who\u2019ve been hurt like this. The romance because it doesn\u2019t seek to complete Dongeun at anytime. She is never seen as a lesser person but instead it gives her a partner who she can lean on and have him lean on her. Their relationship isn\u2019t burdened and it\u2019s a part of her journey to being happy but the not the only thing, that\u2019s awesome because sometimes everything is about the romance and a man completing the woman. Like those simple I love yous at the end were very powerful in their simplicity and honesty.",

Great acting, Park Yeonjin especially nailed it, effortlessly switching between psycho and eerily sweet. Her last scene is one of the better acted scenes I have ever seen in kdrama. B rating comes solely from that unnecessary and kinda soulless love story. I felt no chemistry and the show didnt need it. That relationship would work better as \u201cpartners in crime\u201d for me. Last few eps also had a few minor plotholes here and there.",

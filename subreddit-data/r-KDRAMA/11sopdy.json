Some things were refuted or had been exaggerated, but there was also some truth to it. A year and a half later, does it matter? Probably not. My guess is he\u2019s probably matured and learned from this and as long as he doesn\u2019t badmouth his fellow actors and crew, I\u2019m sure he will be offered some good roles.",

I definitely believe he can make a really good comeback, especially with how well Cha Cha Cha was received.",

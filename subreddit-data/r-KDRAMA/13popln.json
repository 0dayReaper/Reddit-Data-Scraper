Then, his family abruptly moved to the United States, and the duo lost contact with one another. Twenty years later, Oh Young Sim has become a TV producer who makes variety shows. Although she always tries her hardest to score a ratings hit, her TV shows almost invariably **TANK** \u2013 and get canceled! Oh Young Sim hopes to turn over a new leaf when she is given the opportunity to create a pilot for a new romance-themed entertainment show. She decides that she will do whatever it takes to make the show successful. Oh Young Sim wants to cast a hot, eligible bachelor in the show. As such, she decides upon a startup CEO named Mark Wang for the role. But when he arrives for the filming, she suddenly realizes that he is none other than Wang Kyung Tae \u2013 all grown up...and exceptionally handsome to boot!

Her version of comedy is to ugly herself up (OTT acting, scrunched faces, etc.), but she's really pretty so it doesn't land the way she intended. So, if Kim Seulki was cast the comedy would probably work better because the acting wouldn't be so OTT.\n\nSong Ha Yoon was great in Devilish Joy because her type of comedic acting worked for the role.",

I mostly have an issue with how her character was written more than anything else. \n\nI think a huge reason why she's so unlikeable is because she's mean for technically no good reason. Sure &gt;!she thinks shes misunderstood because of how the cartoon portrayed her as a child!&lt; but I hardly think that's a solid reason to be cruel to others (if should any excuse exist at all). Of course, I'm not saying that I would excuse her behavior if she had a sob story, however a bit of relatable backstory would help me empathizing with her.",

It makes the production look cheap. I also find flaws in the makeup- it's slightly white and oily. ML has tanned hands as example. \n\nEp 4\n\nThis episode was actually an improvement in screenplay. The writing and acting was better. I still don't like the camerawork. This is, by far, the best episode! I just don't have anything to comment over the story. &gt;!

I saw the comments before watching and hoped I would feel differently but not the case lol. \n\nThe FL is trying really hard to be funny and quirky and it\u2019s coming off as obnoxious and bad acting. The nose rubbing, the voice, the faces, if all of that plus some were toned down I think the character would come off better. I liked the actress in Devilish Joy but not really here.\n\nAs for the ML, I think the 2 of them are made for each other. Obnoxious and all over the place \ud83d\ude02",

That's how I tolerate the FL.  I don't know if the cast members will change their portrayal, but the story is amusing and something I look forward to watching, even if not 1st thing in the early am like most k-drama releases.",

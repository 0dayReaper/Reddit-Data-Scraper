I'm so glad redditors in this sub were able to look past the grand romantic gestures and declarations, and chose the couple with the healthiest relationship in the end.

Anyone can lovebomb you and make you feel butterflies all over, but the best kind of love is consistent and steady and makes you feel like you're home. \u2764\ufe0f",

    "postText": "Welcome to our **Spotlight On** post series where you can share your picks of dramas that deserve the spotlight! Each **Spotlight On** post is focused on a genre or theme, as you can see in the post title. Based on this genre/theme, you are welcome to share your views about dramas you have watched that fit the topic of this post, which is:\n\n**Horror**\n\nDramas that deliberately scare or frighten the audience, through suspense, violence or shock. These often involve supernatural elements such as ghosts or monsters.\n\nYou are invited to share short (or long) reviews of dramas you have watched that fit the topic of this post and an explanation of why you think the drama deserves the spotlight, including whether you would recommend the drama or not.\n\nOur suggested format/structure for comments is:\n\n**Drama Name**\n\n* **Good Things**: about the drama, \n\n* **Bad Things**: about the drama\n\n* **Interesting Things**: about the drama\n\n* **Spotlight On Because**: explain why you think the drama deserves the spotlight, including whether you would recommend the drama or not.\n\nWe strongly encourage you to share your MDL profile so that others can compare their tastes with yours to get a better understanding of preferences and dislikes, which will help in understanding if the feedback provided is applicable for them.\n\nPlease remember that every individual watching goes in with their own life experiences and biases so not everyone will see the drama in the same light or enjoy it in the same way.\n\n**Just because someone did not enjoy a drama that you loved is not a slight against you as a person.**\n\nWhen participating in this discussion please remember that whilst dramas do not have feelings, human beings do. ***Be kind to one another.***\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or anything you think should be redacted.** If you are using Markdown and not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

            "comment": "A short review of the horror thriller **Somebody** (2022, 8 episodes). I watched it on Netflix and while I was vaguely aware that Netflix dramas can be a lot more explicit, I wasn't quite prepared for the level of graphic sex and violence in this series. \n\nWith that said, Somebody is the story of Kim Sum (Kang Hye-rim), a studious and quiet girl who invents an AI interface which sees comments which are typed and then deleted. The AI Somebody then poses the questions or points to the larger discussion as if they were its own, sort of a \"voice for the voiceless\".\n\nSum has clear OCD traits but I'm in no way qualified to say whether this series accurately portrays any mental illness aside from \"traits that will make the FL seem creepy.\" Suffice to say, while Sum has girlfriends, notably Im Mok-won (Kim Yong-ji), a wheelchair bound cop, Somebody has been her closest relationship since the invention. \n\nOnce Somebody is discovered by a conglomerate and released to the public as a dating and chat app, it doesn't take long before a serial killer uses it as his hunting ground. \n\nIf you're already a fan of Kim Young-kwang from other series like **Call it Love** or **Hello, Me!** I'm not sure how you'll react to his turn here as Seong Yun-o, a serial killer who torments his victims both physically and mentally. The actor does manage to elicit a lot more sympathy for the character than he deserves! \n\nNo plot spoilers, just to say that everything about this series was really well done, from the script to the direction to the acting, but if it's not the type of gruesome cat and mouse game you enjoy watching, I'd skip it. If this is your bag, it's a good example of the genre! \n\nAlso, I don't have a problem with gore most of the time, but I'm particularly sensitive to slicing, like with scalpels or razors, so suffice to say, there are images in this series that made me viscerally ill and they'll be in my brain forever. Sorry, brain.",

Bringing the lonely crown prince, Lee Hwan into her life at just the right moment, Jae Yi is saved from a dismal fate, but her salvation comes at a price.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Plagued by a mysterious curse, Lee Hwan agrees to help Jae Yi, but only if she agrees to help him break his curse in return. Unable to refuse such an offer, Jae Yi agrees to the prince\u2019s terms, setting them both on an unexpected path toward love. But what chance does their love have of surviving when one of them is a former murder suspect and the other is a cursed prince?\n\n* **Streaming Sources:** [TVING](https://tving.com/), [Viki](https://viki.com/), [Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Prime-Video/b/ref=atv_pr_sw_sc?node=2676882011)\n* **Conduct Reminder:** We encourage our users to read the following before participating in any discussions on [/r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA): (1) [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439), (2) our [Conduct Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_1._conduct) (3) our [Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies), and (4) the [When Discussions Get Personal Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/jqrjx6/meta_when_discussions_get_personal/).\n   * Any users who are displaying negative conduct (including but not limited to bullying, harassment, or personal attacks) will be given a warning, repeated behavior will lead to increasing exclusions from our community.

But definitely leaning into it now! PHS is so good at playing this... upright, justice-driven, yet brooding and heavy character. Can definitely feel the weight he's put into this character compared to some of his others-- even during some of the comedic scenes.\n\n Love that the trust between the leads is growing. I'm such a sucker for accumulating trust in dramas, and showing how that happens before the crime-solving, butt-kicking synergy ramps up.\n\nKim Myungjin (physician / autopsy specialist) and FL get along so well, ha. Speaking the same language-- reminds me of how people say that sometimes your best friend will end up with someone whom is basically you but someone they're  romantically attracted to (know thats true for me and my really good friend-- her fiance is pretty much a less traumatized male version of me, ha).",

But the drama still only showed a villain using violence against his subordinates when in reality it was a near-universal aspect of life. It is unrealistic, for example, that someone like Jaeyi would have a sisterly, gentle bond with her maid the way it\u2019s shown here in the drama. Even if a noblewoman liked her maid and was a good mistress to her, their relationship would be much more hierarchical and formal, with the underlying threat of discipline and the norms of propriety drastically limiting the advice and opinions the maid would even consider voicing and the way she expressed them.",

            "comment": "Aaaaaa! \n\nEp 6 hooked me. \n\nI get that crown prince has such serious trust issues that he intentionally separates son dol and seong on but ughhh it got PAINFUL in this episode to watch him Force such an unnecessary tension and competition between the two when it would obviously be better for everyone to join forces (given you trust that said forces are guaranteed friends and on your side). And it was absolute kdrama CRACK when right when I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore - when son dol goes to reinvestigate the shaman\u2019s house by herself instead of together with seong on - the drama gave it a chance through the back door. \n\nAnd it just filled my kdrama heart that it\u2019s jae yi that pushes the beginning of a productive alliance between the two after seong on proves he can be a grown up non jealous adult committed to the bigger mission. \n\nI love that jae yi has little s subversions as much as her BIG S cross dressing girl in a mans world subversions. Ie- that she gently goes about in that episode healing the competition and separation cp created between her and seong on. I\u2019m looking forward to her finding ways to bridge gaps and collaborate when cp would rather still push forced isolations. I hope she does it and the drama provides opportunities for it. \n\nThe scene where they are walking back hit me how strangely deep and intense their dynamic really is for not knowing  each other\u2014 that according to ritual rites of submitting acceptance letters to their ancestors they already are essentially married. We\u2019ve seen cute giggly rosy scenes of both of them being in love with the idea of being in love and knowing enough about the others reputation to get drunk on a hazy idea of a happy and fulfilled future - but it was all innocent kid puppy love. The \u201cokay you think you know love but you\u2019ve never experienced it\u201d. But that scene of them walking silently, her trailing back and both of them lost in serious thoughts about the other hit home that this isn\u2019t all rose tinted love fluff of the long distance crush. These two genuinely have gone through stages of serious deeper bonding sealed in tradition and rites. It gave me finally the crucial piece I needed to respect their dynamic.\n\nAnd somehow managing to ground the characters in ritual, tradition, and duty in a plotline that otherwise blasts characters way past the range of plausibility is ** impressive**. \n\nIt also for me provided the necessary key to appreciating the painful and oh so guilty pleasure further unfolding of dynamics jae yi has with the two. I get now what the basis is for the verrryy different ways she feels emotionally close and bound to both. That she is genuinely interested in being close to both and won\u2019t see how that clashes or collides was for me well established today. It\u2019s going to be gut wrenching but kdramas are addictive because of the palpable pain ;) \n\nAlso got interested in broader plotline finally and political intrigues. I like that there are not just two clashing political powers in the court but three. And then now those three \u201cgroups\u201d have their own chaotic inner worlds and hierarchies. \n\nIt also doesn\u2019t escape me that I loved the episode that featured second leads the least. Hehehehe. They\u2019re comedic elements last a tad bit too long and I JUST WANT JAE YI WITH HER BOIZ ALL THE TIME ALL DAY LONG. SORRY CANT HELP IT",

I wonder how they're going to resolve the budding romance between them, though, given that it was very strictly illegal for nobles to marry commoners in Joseon.\n\nAlso I'm so here for Sergeant Han &gt;!getting homoerotically jealous of/competitive with his own fianc\u00e9e over the crown prince's attention while thinking she's a suspicious palace eunuch and being reluctantly impressed by her when they're forced to work together!&lt;. Such a fun twisty dynamic! I wish her relationship with the crown prince had some of that tension; it feels like he became a simp for her too abruptly.\n\n(I usually find the crossdressing trope in historical romance boring because kdramas don't do anything interesting with it, so I'm a little bummed that the one time it's working for me it's with the second male lead.)\n\nI can already tell the grand prince's mother is going to piss me off all drama. She's always acting outraged when her uncle does evil shit, but she never does anything to actually defy or check him.\n\nFeels like the point of episode 5 was largely to establish the crown prince as someone who can't sympathise with other people and to foreshadow the irony of his paranoid attitude toward his best friend being the thing that will ultimately push Sergeant Han away and drive him to turn on the crown prince. Like yes, the crown prince is technically right, &gt;!Sergeant Han should have told him about the compass right away!&lt;. The king (or the one who will be king) can demand absolute loyalty from his followers, even above their duty to their parents. But also it was an inconsequential and very human, understandable error of judgement from Sergeant Han and he admitted to it himself. The crown prince should have balanced his reprimand with something like \"thank you\"/\"I understand you were in a difficult position\"/\"I believe you would have told me eventually.\"\n\nSince this flaw in his personality was established so clearly in several different scenes today, I expect the crown prince to get some character development in that direction later, but I don't know if it will be quick enough to salvage his friendship with Sergeant Han.",

            "comment": "FL chased down SML and was ignored, and then when she finally gets his attention she said \"I knew you would listen to even a lowly eunuch\". Kind of broke me tbh. I don't think SML is looking down on her simply because she's competition, I think it genuinely bothers him that a lowly eunuch is besting him, and it's such a bad look. Even during the public meeting about the cases, he was super reluctant in taking her suggestions into consideration. Is it really because he simply wants to prove himself? Or does he actually look down on servants? In any case, SML syndrome is not going to be an issue here for me, team Crown Prince all the way home.",

Up until this point, I feel like the plot has been rather disjointed between slapstick and mystery/ghost plot; plus, there have been excessive flashbacks. I haven't really been sold on this drama up until now, but I have been intrigued nonetheless. Ep 6 feels like maybe the drama is starting to figure out the pacing a bit better. We're starting to get into the meat of the mystery now, instead of it being on the back burner while FL proves herself by solving other mysteries. There have been improvements. I still feel like there's something missing that could make this drama really stand out.\n\nSide note: the long &gt;!white hair magically appearing on the shaman and alleged lover was super freaky!&lt; it reminded me of a Nancy Drew game I played as a kid (The Haunting of Castle Malloy) that had a wild banshee and it terrified me.

I think something about the white long hair is suspicious like he\u2019s being controlled by psychedelic drugs/incense related to that shaman&lt;!",

He\u2019s still handsome but properly matured! Love it. I also like that his office makes him look so poor but he obviously makes a lot of money - look at his car and his home! The female actress in episode 1 was also famous a while back and I remember she married a soccer player. She basically looks the same. So glad to see her back! I was wondering what had happened to her.",

Personally, I have a bit of a black &amp; white view about cheating. I don't really believe that people cheat when they're lonely etc. etc. But \"childish insecure trust issues\"?\n\nThe guy has installed cameras in the house to keep a eye on his wife, takes Pic of his wife's underwear to track her movement, forces her to update him about her every movement, isolated her from her friends, left her humiliating notes to berate her &amp; grabs her hair when he's angry. There's nothing \"childish\" about that. That's classic abuser behavior. And this has been going on for 3 years, so you can't argue that maybe his wife's suspicious behaviour set him off. He was always an abusing piece of s**t. On top of that, the guy was manipulating his own child. \n\nNow, does that exempt the wife from what she does? No. The cheating is on her. But the show is about divorce suits &amp; the episode was about who gets custody. In this situation, the wife definitely seem like the better person to raise the child. So I don't see why the viewers should be insulting the wife.",

It was implied that he was forcing his child to lie in therapy. When the child came out of the therapy session, the father asked him what question he got and whether he answered as he had been taught, which implied that the father had researched/had someone find out what common questions for therapy sessions like this are and trained the son what to answer. Manipulating with therapy definitely indicates that he does not care about the child's wellbeing. \n\n2) The mother cheated and I don't know what direction the show will take, but generally, cheaters also happen to cheat repeatedly, making them bad partners. But that doesn't mean they make bad parents. Talking realistically, if someone really cared about their child, they would learn a lesson from this &amp; try to be more present for them. The father, on the other hand, was a habitual abuser &amp; gaslighter who was already trying to manipulate the son to serve his needs. He would definitely have made the son's life hell. That's why he's being berated for stuff he did to the wife, because that's indication that he will be doing the same with his son.\n\nWhy do you say it was out of character for the dad to do what he did?",

I just thought it\u2019d be more light hearted based on the trailer, like a trio of old dudes being bros and living their best lives.\n\nEp. 1:  &gt;! I\u2019m guessing the father abused the boy? That's why he had such a violent fit/nightmare? And it tracks with how cruel and authoritarian he seems, esp in the car after therapy scene. But other people's theory that the father showed the video to him makes sense too, it would track with why he threw the phone like that. But the preview's coutroom scene and the need for a trial implies a more darker story? !&lt;\n\nI was like bold choice, writers, I'm supposed to root for the guy who's defending an adulteress? the &gt;! same mom who didn't pick up the phone when her kid was in the hospital bc she was busy banging some other dude? then it turned out her husband was a monster who psychologically tortured her (and possibly her son) for 7 years. just messed up all around.!&lt;\n\nEP. 2: so I was very wrong and everyone else was right. &gt;! The fact that he showed the kid the sex video of his mom... Just unspeakably f**ked up. Even his own lawyer looked disgusted. And he has the audacity to still hope for future lawsuits?!&lt;\n\nAnyways, I hope the kid manages to move out ASAP when he comes of age and manages to heal from the trauma of his parents' bakchodi. And look, while Seo-jin may be... questionable morally (an angel compared to her ex tho), &gt;!I'm glad she's sticking around and hopefully becoming a part of the team!&lt;. I may not like her character as a person, but wow the actress is so classically attractive, she looks like an old timey star. \n\nImma keep it real, while the previous case was super engaging, the new one feels like a let down. Ofc I'm behind the poor wife but this whole storyline feels very makjangy and overacted imo. But let's see what next week brings.\n\nI liked the scenes with the friends, it was genuinely really funny. From the previews, maybe we're entering Law Cafe or ODL territory, with all the humour and banter and goofy antics, esp with Seo-jin joining them.\n\nInterested in seeing more about ML's backstory. The thing with the grapes painting, why he left Germany... &gt;!And he's separated from his niece and nephew apparently!&lt;?",

The scene of them splitting up the kimchi is so mundane yet so so good.\n\nI'm not really feeling the case. This stuff is very difficult to get right without making one side heinously evil. Even more so when you consider in Korea there's technically not an equivalent to a No Fault divorce. Uncontested divorces yes. But if it's contested by the other spouse, you have to have an actual cause of action for divorce.\n\nThus, a drama plot point.\n\nAlso, for other context for this case, people may be a familiar with the Hong Sang Soo and Kim Min Hee scandal where the judge did not grant him a divorce because the unfaithful spouse cannot file for divorce due to infidelity - only the noncheating spouse can use that cause. He needed to use one of the other causes of action - which he couldn't.\n\nIn this case, they may use the fact that the husband probably &gt;!showed the son the sex tape to turn him against his mom and cause mental and emotional distress !&lt; to support a cause of action related to family mistreatment.\n\nLet's see how it goes.",

It's good to apologize and explain that sometimes adults make bad decisions.   But you need to hold your emotions in check, otherwise, you are laying an unfair burden on your kid.  A sincere apology and a promise to do better is superior to what she did, forcing the poor child to shoulder her guilt and shame.  It made for good drama, but bad parenting.\n\nI often find that Koreans in dramas aren't much for explanations.  Mostly the expectation is for someone to get on their knees and repeat, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Maybe it's a cultural thing.  Personally, I prefer an explanation to go along with the apology.  I want to understand the whys and it helps me accept the apology.",

The child actor was great, hope he didn't immerse himself into his role and forgot everything once he finished acting, or it could be traumatic for him. \n\nAnyway that pos deserved those slaps, hhj in the court scene was fantastic. Looks like she will be working in his office from next ep. Though unlikely, hope we will finally get to see csw in a romantic plot.\n\nSo csw could either be a divorcee or had bad memories of his close family members going through bad divorce, probably his parents. That conversation with the kid mentally broke him as if he could relate to his painful experience. \n\nAbout the cleaner lady's case, I think they will be divorcing to protect their children from the empathyless granny. Though not sure how a divorce is going to solve their financial problems. The obvious solution is moving out of that house, idk what the writer is planning. Or could be the granny forced his super filial spineless son to divorce her. Btw I found the fat lady beating the skinny granny strangely comedic.",

He could have broken a family Csw knows (probably his parent's or his parent's extended family since niece was mentioned) and made the culprit win the case.

Also, I gotta say I'm intrigued, cheating can be a nightmare to get right in fiction, but at the same time I'm a bit annoyed at how it's often presented as a black and white thing especially in korean dramas, as if cheater = irredeemable mass murderer. \n\nSo I was very interested in the bold choice of trying to make an adulterer sympathetic. And they pulled out all the stops too, what with a sex tape filmed right as her kid was desperately calling for her from the hospital lmao, that was sick. \n\nIt's easy to pull the heartstrings with classic kdrama tragedy like poor background, abuse/bullying, terminal illness, etc. This is the main complaint I had with Hi Bye mama for example, it was often too easy, their attempts to make the audience feel sad were sometimes too blatant and crude. But I think it takes a great writer and cast to pull off a sympathetic character who *genuinely* messed up, who was definitely in the wrong yet convincingly works towards redeeming him/herself *and* is not defined solely by this mistake, so I was very curious to see how this one would go.  \n\nAnd I think they did it rather well,right up until the husband turned out to be a downright abusive man... I'm disappointed that they couldn't just make him a negligent husband, maybe too focused on his work to give his family the required amount of care, or simply falling out of love with her and not willing to put in the work needed to make the marriage work. Some of the case in strangers again were better in that regard. Instead they seemingly are making him so awful that it almost justifies the affair, though I'm pleased to see they didn't just sweep it under the rug and made it clear that the affair was 100% on her. She did wrong, but at the same time is still a mother who genuinely wants to do right by her son and live with him, *in that order*. That multi-layered characterization was pretty good. \n\nIf they can keep and improve that nuanced, slice of life feel this might turn out to be good.",

Would there be a video to show if there wasn't any in the first place. \nLike why is she being painted as the good one when she didn't consider how it would psychology affect her child, not just from the divorce. But the future relationship of her son, who could develop trust issues on women in general. Having not be able to respect women and potentially turn the same as his father. If she really thought of her son like she is now, how could she even consider cheating? I believe there's no valid for anyone to cheat. \n\nLike if you don't feel happy then get divorced, but she had to be defended as a second hand victim due to the abuse she gets from her husband. I just can't stomach this, first part was great but as the details gets revealed, I just can't. I don't like how they're trying to white wash her and be the victim. The real victim is the son, there is no lesser evil in the two of them. \n\nIt was bad to use this as the first case. This divorce attorney is exactly why people hate attorneys in general because they have to work with cheaters all the time and defend them.",

This meant that she was vulnerable to romantic attention from another man, hence the affair. However, the affair man also victimised her by sharing the illegally filmed video online. Thus invading her right to privacy and ruining her career due to stigma.\n\nYou seem to be placing all the blame on the woman's actions but here we have 2 men, one of whom controlled his wife down to memorising her under wear and showing her sex tape to their 7 year old, and another guy who picked up a married woman, seduced her and then published a private video of her, both of which the men did are illegal.\n\nBoth the men committed actual crimes, yet you're concerned about an affair that was 50% her fault (two to tango),  whereas the guys have 100% culpability. \n\nAsk yourself why you have put the role of woman on a pedestal but accept men will be men?",

I started skimming so maybe I missed it)....shit reminds me of twice in my life so far some dude trying to prove himself or insult me ask if he can talk to someone I'm dating, to which I replied sure, I can't stop you that's her call, I then end up with an angry partner asking me if i told them they could talk to them aka try to get with them.......now certainly i get where my partner was coming from and why they were angry, but my reply always remained the same, I can't stop anyone from trying to get with you, I can't say no for you, its not my job to shut other dudes down that's your job and your call.........now she shuts them down and they won't let it go and harass her that's a different story I've never been the hasty to fight type but I've also never shied away from one, I've gone so far as even unbelievably foolishly giving people my address and walking out alone and unarmed to face someone who wants to fight not even knowing if a group and or weapons was awaiting me.\n\nTLDR the cheating spouse is always at fault for an affair, stop trying to make excuses for it and trying to lessen their blame by even acting like the single party shares blame.",

I agree, there's no reason to cheat, and Shin himself pointed out that she is totally in the wrong for cheating and even tells her son that both his parents were in the wrong. \n\nShin seems like he's mainly working with her to get the kid away from the abusive parent, and even told the son to move out of her place as soon as he's 18. So even though some viewers might downplay her cheating, it seems like the show did not. Abuse is worse, for sure, but cheating isn't right either and also sets a bad example for the kid.",

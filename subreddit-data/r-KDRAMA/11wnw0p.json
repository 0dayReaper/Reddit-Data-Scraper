I guess the production also made it obvious so we wont have trouble with the guessing game lol!&lt;\n- The watchman who protected snowflake is a woman and im guessing that its the kisaeng lady. Her identity will only be revealed after we see the scar.\n- Theres also a chance for the watchman to be dan o\u2019s sister (i honestly forgot why she lost her mind and im already too sleepy to rewatch lol) but right now, im already too invested with the kisaeng lady being in it.\n- I think the twist will be the eunuch never really betrayed snowflake and that he\u2019s been protecting him all along. Probably even raised him. Everything was all an act\u2026 or he did betray him and now he\u2019s cooking up something bcs he knows the king is on the way to madness.\n- Siyeol is such a smart and observant guy. I feel like he could either be a villain or some figure who will save their asses in the end. He could even be the love interest or dan o\u2019s sister.\n- Yuha mustve been friends with snowflake\u2026 or at least, he knows something about what happened in the past with the way he went arnold with the clenched fists.\n\n\nLol im really too invested in this.",

So far, I think I have a love/hate relationship with this drama lol\n\nAlso, I\u2019m a big fan of Extraordinary You so its fun seeing lee dohwa say dan o again even if its no longer kim hye yoon lol\n\nEP 1:\n- Its been a while since i saw one of these freeze-focus-fade opening sequence. Had me remembering the good old kdrama days.\n- The children\u2019s scene was adorable but I flinched at the OST. Honestly, that was too loud and abrupt. It almost sounded like a joke\u2014I mean like one of those soundbites that play after something funny or weird happens. I was really shocked. Was hoping for something melowy and dramatic.\n- The pacing is so weird at the beginning idk why.\n- Honestly, the first 10 minutes felt like it was a scene that\u2019s supposed to mock historical drama tropes. Kang San\u2019s fight scene matrix had me gagging. It was so weirdly funny.\n- The acting and the visuals are adorable.\n- The King\u2026. I adore the actor from Law School, but he doesnt look like a king. Im so sorry but he looks like  the twin sister princess who had to take her twin brother crown prince\u2019s identity and ended up becoming the king of joseon (iykwm)\n- Of course, every FL in a histrorical drama has to be in a pile of debt lol\n\nEp 2\n- The pacing is wayyyy better than ep 1 but the progress of emotions are so weird like &gt;!why is kang san acting all lovey dovey over dan o this fast? does he already remember that dan o saved him when they were kids \u2014 yes, im already sure that kang san is snowflake!&lt;\n- logic aside, i adore &gt;!kang san\u2019s actions toward dan o. the way he kept blushing had me giggling!&lt;\n- i was expecting yiseol to be included in the love line but looks like his character has another destination lol\n- the dumpling scene is so funny. kinda reminds me of park jin\u2019s cooking in alchemy of souls lol\n\nI know i have too much complaints, but I\u2019m really enjoying this. Cant wait for next week\u2019s episode",

In English, though, they've made it 'season OF deity', rather than 'Kokdu's Season', which still wouldn't have been a great title, but would've given that same sense of her being 'his' - his Season (Gye Jeol), and his love - *and* this being his current 'season' of being on earth. In English, this double meaning doesn't come out because of how they've phrased it, and because they chose 'deity' instead of 'Kokdu' for that part.\n\nDoes 'Gye Jeol' just mean 'season', or 'seasons'?",

A pacifist prince?\n\nLooks like we might have 3 rivals for our lovely \"maiden\" and all four are already bonded in friendship and purpose.\n\nAlso a lot of fun were the echoes of Crash Course in Romance, what with all rival preparatory schools for the state exams.\n\nThe more I think about it the more I like this show!",

            "comment": "Wrote what is basically a novel about who I think ML is on MDL that I'll post a tiny bit of here! \n\nI think Ryeoun is clear ML:\n\n* He is the gruff martial artist guy who wants to protect his friends/family/crush; he is a little cold and tsundere and slightly antagonistic, leading to the classic 'begrudgingly falls in love with FL and protects her constantly' which we all know and love\n* In the [official promo image](https://mydramalist.com/photos/BddB6V_4) where FL is being held by man in maroon uniform, the man's hands closely resemble Ryeoun's, not just in finger shape but in skin tone (he is more tanned/olive-toned than the other two ML actors). Plus, this uniform features fabric ties around the wrist which are also present in [Ryeoun's other uniform](https://mydramalist.com/photos/d00JP0_3), where tight sleeves would help prevent fabric from interfering with the use of weapons\n* Official promo stills featuring FL and all ML's individually show FL in shy/potentially platonic poses with both [Kang Hoon](https://mydramalist.com/photos/d00QkW_3) and [Jung Gun Joo](https://mydramalist.com/photos/kAA3mr_3), whereas with [Ryeoun](https://mydramalist.com/photos/2ww5pw_3) they are holding hands. The taglines for each poster also support my theory if you read the translations ([available here](https://www.soompi.com/article/1571087wpp/shin-ye-eun-and-her-3-male-co-stars-have-different-kinds-of-chemistry-in-couple-posters-for-the-secret-romantic-guesthouse) if you want to check them out)\n* All released trailers ([40s teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRRDHAgphPE), [40s teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvxV8sSL-Jg&amp;t=1s), [40s teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJYgEyjbWQs), &amp; [long 4m trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67UZ8MsnmH4&amp;t=1s)) feature her in the most explicitly romantic-tension filled scenes with Ryeoun (i.e. he is protecting her physically from danger, puts his hand over her eyes to shield her line of sight when someone is executed in the street, pulls her onto his chest as they gaze into each other's eyes, etc) as opposed to the other 2 ML's where the relationship is portrayed as comical and/or shy 'tension' that is usually associated with SML status\n\nHere's hoping because I love this guy. He had great tension with FL but Jung Yoo Ha is a surprise second contender, though I think he's probably the lost prince Lee Seol. Though this may be the kind of saeguk where they throw in a lot of plot twists just to mess with the audience and 'subvert expectations' (ugh) so it's anyone's guess really!!!",

It covers the time period near the downfall of Baekje so the stakes feel high and even though most of it is just people standing around talking, it feels tense.\n\nOne reason I've really enjoyed it is for the costuming -- gorgeous costuming that differs from the hanboks we see in Joseon-era dramas.\n\nThe story is a very fictionalized retelling of history as actual historical records of Gye Baek is sparse and really only his famous last battle is well-recorded in history.",

So I think the show is deliberately making everyone think he's a total idiot, and he's overplaying that part because he may actually flip at some point down the line. I paid careful attention in Ep. 2 when &gt;!he audaciously reminded the officers to pay attention to him and ask him his name. And if he's claiming to be the son of a concubine, that could be a good explanation if anyone thinks he looks like he might be related to royalty... !&lt;I'm just not willing to assume Lee Seol is going to turn out to be Kang San just yet. That would simply be too easy and far too simple. Maybe Kang San is connected in some way as well, though.\n\nI think the show is going to play with us and keep us guessing, setting it up for everyone to think it's one ML, then switching to the next, and then to the next. There are plenty more episodes to go!",

She's fine in this--completely different personality, the mark of an excellent actor. But she OWNED the glory, a perfect match for the incredible acting powers of Jung Ji So. Possibly one of the only shows in which the kid actors were better than the adults (except Song Hye-Ko of course).",

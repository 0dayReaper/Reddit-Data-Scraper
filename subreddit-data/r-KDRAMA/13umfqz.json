Apparently the writer pitched his idea since 2009, so i'm confident he has a lot of ideas ready for season two, the first season also set up a lot for the next season, especially the last episode. I do hope he doesn't feel too much pressure, his show became such an unexpected hit, it must be horrible writing this while millions of people will judge him and companies bet on him making the brand bigger :/. \n\nAlso, i started Happiness because i finished All of us Are Dead a few days ago (and loved it) and got a taste for Zombie shows. So far it's fun!",

Characters are messy and flawed without a perfectly clean resolution to all of the stories (like life) if thats ok with you it may be worth checking out.\n\n**Dr. Romantic 3** is airing which is good and has romance alongside the medical aspects.\n\nAgree with the recs you mentioned already, loved **Divorce Attorney Shin** and **The Good Bad Mother** also **Dr. Cha** is currently airing with slight romance and some great comedy although content warning &gt;!infidelity!&lt; is a major plot point (revealed in episode one) which is a deal breaker for some.\n\nOh almost forgot! **Crash Course in Romance** had a lovely romance although it did have a &gt;!murder!&lt; side plot (revealed in episode one) that folks were less than thrilled with but personally I think it's still worth checking out!\n\nLastly, I haven't watched it yet but if you're not in the APAC region I heard **Crazy Love** was recently released on Hulu/more broadly outside the APAC region which may be worth checking out if you weren't able to see it before due to its limited distribution, Ive heard great things about it.",

Definitely recommend Dr. Romantic series as a whole but as a heads up season 3 is only available on Disney+ unfortunately. Season 2 doesn't end on a cliffhanger or anything though so no worries that you can't watch it right now, you can still enjoy the first two seasons!\n\nAlso season 1 and 2 some different core casts, I do recommend both but romance wise S2 is probably better. You can start there and go back to season 1 or go in order, up to you, going in order just helps give foundational characterization for characters that are in all the seasons.",

More episodes down I still don\u2019t hate this drama and I really want to finish it, but I get where everyone is coming from. I can\u2019t stand the second ML &gt;!I think it\u2019s starting to get ridiculous and I\u2019m annoyed every time I see him. Imagine cheating while planning your marriage, and now you\u2019re still so obsessed with your ex fianc\u00e9. Get a grip. The whole fighting scene was very cringe to me too!&lt; I\u2019m curious to see if my opinion about him will still change.\n\nI also started **mr sunshine** and **he is psychometric** and I both can\u2019t get in to them yet. I do need to say I don\u2019t like historical nor fantasy, but I really want to push myself. I\u2019m still new to the kdrama world and this challenge and I want to try and finish 36 dramas, so I\u2019m really hesitant to drop them. After watching **hwarang** and loving it I hoped I found a new love for historical dramas, but it doesn\u2019t seem that way for now. Any motivation to just keep going, because it does get better is very welcome hahaha",

I've been a lifelong fantasy fan and I love dragons shapeshifters, so it immediately got my interest.\n\nOnly on episode one, but so far so good.\n\nPS.

Reading about the kind of bullying that goes on in Korea/Japan,I wasn't too shocked by how its portrayed but that being said,some of the bullies ride the line between believable and cartoonish. \n\nI'm sure conservative Korea was clutching its pearls at some of these scenes. It kind of reminded me of Euphoria. The scenes aren't necessary but they make an impression.\n\nIt took a bit to adjust to the tone of the show. Mostly because I went into it expecting a much more somber,murky feel. Those opening shots from ep.1 (highway panning and the zoom through the playground) were so damn genius.\n\nMy only gripes are that they could've introduced the bullies better and the pacing is too fast for a revenge plot. At times it felt like someone turning a book page before I finished reading it. I'm going to stick with it though. This show was popular for a reason.",

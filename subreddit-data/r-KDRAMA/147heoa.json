Also, ML's mom is basing her conclusion on the matchbox and yarn, the former of which is accessible to any customers, and the latter seems like a common enough item? !&lt;\n\nI'm ready to be completely wrong though.

His mom is confusing easy coincidences with evidence; and the reason the car wasn't in the garage is probably because his dad finished fixing it and took it for a ride to see if it works well, then noticed the weird time travel equipment. He probably ran away thinking it was the killer who made that noise. \n\nI was thinking the killer could be on the police force. Go mi sook said that the killer will definitely not get caught...this made me think that he must be someone with power or access to to make things go his way. And with the missing note in the matchbox, I'm even more convinced that it's a cop. \n\nNow for future's soon eh's reaction to the killer, and with the little tease of the fl's uncle \"I'm angry\" ....idk, I don't think it's him. My mind is also going to future go mi sook and her brother when he was let out of prison. Her pants were covered in mud or blood (can't remember) but it was on the same day that future soon eh died (I think). \n\nWe must've already seen the killer in the show. But literally nothing is making any sense \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 if I want to just look at the evidence they're getting of the killer now (in the past), then everything is telling me it's a cop. He had connections to all the victims so far. The teacher (ex-con, cops were after her), the sister (always out drinking in clubs, must've come across the cops on patrol for underage drinking. and the fraud incident, probably went to give a statement, and right before she died, she was in contact with the teacher.)\n\nAnd as mentioned before, a cop would have access to all the evidence brought in and power to make the investigation come to a dead end.\n\nBut who the heck could that cop be to elicit a reaction from future soon eh? Unless the person who killed soon eh, is someone else, a copy cat.",

Yuseob did have an alibi, being in Seoul for the first two murders and was bleeding pretty severely. As much as the police may be incompetent, ML's dad being able to sift through Dong Shik's desk to grab the note is less plausible than a fellow cop doing so.!&lt;\n\nOh I was just thinking, what if the Soon Ae's reaction before she was killed &gt;!was not for the killer, but for Mi Sook? Like you said, Mi Sook's pants were muddy, so she was probably there.!&lt; I went back to watch the epilogue in episode 5, and Soon Ae's line was &gt;!\"How could you deceive everyone after doing such a thing\", which could be referring to Misook lying about her brother being the culprit, and not about the killing itself. Perhaps Soon Ae figured out that Misook's brother was framed after reading the books? The scene didn't actually show her falling into water after her backing towards it, so there could have been some time between that scene and her death? !&lt;",

I really don't think he did it.\n\nThanks for going bk to watch ep 5, what you said makes so much sense. And if you think about time (past and future) being parallel, then what happened in ep 5 in the future was before the ML and FL intervened and before mi sook's plan to frame her brother failed. And when future soon ae died, wasn't it after the ML went bk in time and stopped the brother from committing suicide in jail?\n\n So let's assume future soon ae's death happened after the past was altered. Go mi sook now has her abusive brother out of jail for a murder he didn't commit, and that she framed him for. Shes scared and needs to have some control over her brother, what better way to control him than to kill someone and frame him again, this time it would be easier to convince people he did it since he went away for the crime. Based on the interview she did in ep 1, I remember she was asked \"why is the killer a woman?\" And she replied \"I want to show the world that women are also capable of doing something like this.\" \n\nAt first I thought the real killer was actually a woman, up until ep 12. But now thinking about it, mi sook probably grew up to be a lot more gutsy and now has a lot of money and knows how the world works more. Future go mi sook would probably have no problem killing to get what she wants. Future soon ae was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Go mi sook was already frustrated with her since ppl still ask her about the book she stole. So soon ae was just her perfect victim and met all the criteria that the real killer looks for. What future go mi sook didn't account for was soon ae's death being closed as a suicide.\n\n I think that if the FL went bk to the future now, her mom would be alive. Because if the real killer was actually a cop, then during all the years that went by, he climbed the social ladder and can't afford mistakes anymore, so he never killed again. So the timing of soon ae's death is weird, it would make more sense if it was mi sook. And what soon ae was saying before her death, mi sook probably was telling her all about the framing. Like a psychopath explaining to the victim why they're about to kill them.\n\nEdit: and the person who kills the ML in the future would probably be the real killer. The most plausible explanation would be that in the real timeline, he figured out who the real killer was and since the real killer is now a powerful individual (assuming cop who climbed the social ladder) he kills him to protect himself. That seems to be the case with this killer killing males.",

Soon Ae's dad's reaction to Hee Seop as well!\n\nEdit: I don't know if it's 9 months before ML has been born yet, but what was he really asking his dad the day after his parents' date?

I think the dad confronted the ML with the matchbox because he didn't understand how the ML could possibly have a non existent object (from a future crime scene) and that scared him. I don't think the public is aware of the match boxes being the killer's MO yet, so why would his dad be scared that ML has a matchbox with a random note in his house unless he's the killer?\n\nI'm really hoping it's the dad because it would be the coolest twist. I think he also killed ML's mom in the original time line. I'm hoping if it does turn out to be the dad, that his mother is already pregnant when his dad gets arrested. This way the ML doesn't disappear in the future, It's the best ending I can think of.",

            "comment": "\nEp 13 flew by so fast it felt like 10 mins \ud83d\ude2d Im glad Haejoon was able to tell the truth and get out of jail really quick. I didn\u2019t want that storyline to continue for long because we only have 3 eps left. \n\nEven though there weren\u2019t definite clues as to who the killer is, we did get more info about &gt;!Haejoon\u2019s mom!&lt;. Looks like &gt;! she was planning to leave the village even before Haejoon was born, so even though she did technically abandon him, her reason for leaving was\u2019t mainly Haejoon.!&lt; Something definitely happened that night went Haejoon\u2019s parents were on a date for her to ultimately change her mind. I thought Haejoon asking questions about their date to his dad was odd considering he already knows how it gonna end. Either Haejoon\u2019s dad was lying about having a perfect date or Haejoon\u2019s mom hid her plans so well for him to notice that anything was wrong. \n\nIm reaching but my theory is that Haejoon\u2019s mom is already pregnant in the current time line and she\u2019s planning to leave the village because she wants to protect her baby. I mean who wouldn\u2019t want to move when there\u2019s a serial killer going around? Haejoon\u2019s dad might have some how convinced her to stay and she eventually went missing/died bc she was a victim herself. Either nobody knew what really happened to her or Haejoon\u2019s grandpa was able to cover up her missing person\u2019s case as a runaway who abandon her child. Idk I just dont see his mom as someone who would abandon her kid. You can tell that even though Haejoon acts very cold to his mom, she still feel some sort of a connection to him. If his grandpa could feel it, then imagine how familiar his mom would\u2019ve felt towards him? I cant say for sure that &gt;!Haejoon\u2019s dad !&lt; is the killer but whoever it is, they definitely seem to be connected to haejoon\u2019s mom. After all, he frequents the teahouse a lot and he even uses the teahouse merch? \ud83d\udc80 as a signature in his killings. \n\nIm also still suspicious about &gt;!misook !&lt; because well she\u2019s literally insane? I dont trust a word that comes out of her mouth because at the end of the day, she only cares about herself. Does anyone remember &gt;! the necklace future Misook kept touching during her press interview? !&lt; I have a feeling its somehow connected to the killer because they made it very obvious in Episode 1  when the topic was about the first book that took place in 1987.\n\n\nI don\u2019t even care who the killer is atp, I just want to know what happens. This is giving me war flashbacks to Beyond Evil bc I really cant tell what\u2019s going to happen next. Also can we talk about how perfect the casting is for this drama is. The characters from 1987 really make you feel like they\u2019re really from the past. Soonae and Haejoon\u2019s mom especially does a great job convincing us because why does MY heart hurt whenever I see them on the screen? \ud83d\ude2d",

Yu-sub commenting \u2018he\u2019s mad\u2019regarding the ml revealing the killer was kinda sus. What does he mean by that??

Poor Yoon-young has to endure one tragedy after another!&lt;\n\nEP14: And all the dots start to connect. &gt;!Like others, my hunch that it was Hae-jun's father looks like it was correct. He really was giving the typical narcissistic serial killer vibes. But someone gotta help Hae-jun on his solo hero act because that man has thrown himself in front of danger too often. His dad having the car throws and interesting dynamic into this tho.!&lt;\n\nThis show does really well with the slow moments too. Hae-jun especially has these moments where he doesn't say a word yet the way his expression is captivating. Respect to Yoon-young's ability to say things as they are, really told Ko Mi-sook the type of person she is right to her face",

ML grows up with both parents after mom realises Dad is not a killer and Haraboji changes to be the loving grandad that he always imagined. Not sure what I want for Mi Sook - surely not a bestselling author in the future (always has to find an editor who will write the story for her) Can't really see her ending up as mom's assistant, either.

            "comment": "*guys i have another crazy theory\u2026 i know it might sound stupid but hear me out*\nWhat if ML\u2019s father is not his actual father? if you think about it, ML\u2019s mother never really said the name of her boyfriend, and even ML whenever he was talking about him he never really said his name out loud. What the ML  is walking around with his grandpa and the grandpa asks who is the mother ML tells him that it\u2019s the owner of the coffee. I found grandpa\u2019s reaction so strange because first thing first why are you asking me that if you know that my son is currently dating someone?? It would have made sense if the grandpa asked if the current girlfriend/fianc\u00e9 of his son was ML\u2019s future mom. Instead when he heard the truth he literally only said only said *so it\u2019s the owner of the coffee not even her name*. If you remember the episode, when ML goes to the movie theater, there was more than one person wearing the pink headband. \nGotta rewatch that scene but when the father puts his hands around coffe owners shoulder her reaction was too strange. 1. she\u2019s actually dating him and already suspecting him to be the culprit 2. they\u2019re just acquaintance and him putting his arm around her shoulder was just a way to hide the fact that he was there with someone else (like min sook who was still a minor?!?!) \n\nAlso, it\u2019s pretty obvious that the owner of the caf\u00e9 was already pregnant but her \u201cboyfriend\u201d was in the US, the whole freaking time and literally just got back, but she already knew the gender of her baby and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something you can tell after a week of being pregnant. \nAnd if I am right, oh my god, this will also kind of explain why FL\u2019s uncle alibi was fake, he killed both the teacher and FL\u2019s aunt. He was literally the only person that met the two of them. He first killed the teacher, and then when the FL\u2019s aunt came by to drop the book etc, that\u2019s when he killed her. He was literally the only person who knew where she was going to go that night. He told ML is own story and we all agreed that he was innocent. \n\nThe last thing that me think that this theory might be right is the fact that till the end of the episode we never got to see the results of the DNA test. It doesn\u2019t really make sense that they would take a whole episode just to give us the results\u2026 It would\u2019ve been so easy for them to just show  the grandpa and the policeman the result so they would have believed that ML is the grandson.\n*CONCLUSION*\nIt doesn\u2019t really explain why ML ends up, leaving with the grandfather tho but at the same time it make sense why they don\u2019t have that greatest relationship, and the father is never there with him. \n*But yeah, this is just a theory. It\u2019s fun, and might not even be close to what\u2019s actually gonna happen in the next two episodes lol*",

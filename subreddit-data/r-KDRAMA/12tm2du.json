    "postText": "It has been one week since the finale... and to cope with my withdrawal I just wanted to express my love, for **Call It Love.** So many things are contained within me and I'm desperate to find a space to pour it all out. \\[Warning if you haven't seen the show: may contain spoilers\\]. \n\n**The beautiful, realistic portrayal of love.** I think what sets this show apart from a lot of dramas is how natural and realistic the depiction of love is. Don't get me wrong... I do love on-screen cliches like big romantic gestures or fairy tale endings. In fact, sometimes the fantasy of it all is what makes it so enjoyable. But, there are times I just want to feel something familiar and relatable (yes, I have seen My Liberation Notes!). \n\nWoo-Joo and Dong-Jin's romance bloomed so slowly but naturally as it is hard for us to tell when exactly one fell for the other. Facial expressions and gestures were kept low-key and minimal, yet still expressed so much intensity and emotion. Their subtle expressions, gestures, words and conversations genuinely made me remember how I feel when I really like someone. I could tell the writers, director and actors truly understand what love feels and looks like. KYK did say in an interview he believes being in love is when is when you're constantly gazing at them, and I adore seeing him portraying that as Dong-Jin in this show. Dong-Jin also had rekindled his love for camping by sharing that experience with Woo Joo, which reflects the notion that when you\u2019re in love, you just want to share all the things you find beautiful with that person. \n\nOn Woo Joo's portrayal - she may have a prickly demeanor on the exterior, but there have been so many times she has said things to Dong-Jin that were kind of\u2026 sweet? \u201cYou won\u2019t go down, \u201cI want you to live the most comfortable life\u201d \u201cDo what your heart tells you to\u201d and the fact that her character is so brutally honest sometimes makes these lines even sweeter because you know they are genuine. I think her love for Dong-Jin was most expressed through her words. At the beginning of the show, she wondered why Dong-Jin appeared to live such a comfortable life, while she suffered. But as she fell in love, a \"comfortable life\" had a new meaning for her. After she realized how much she had hurt him with her ambivalence (his coldness when Uncle Dae-hong visited the office) she tells Dong-Jin at the hospital that she went to his place to tell him she really meant that she wanted him to live a comfortable life. It was her own way of saying she still cared for him. \n\nI also wanted to praise the beautiful depiction of love not just between romantic partners, but also within family. The sibling bond between all three siblings were all adorable, but I was particularly moved by the bond between Woo-Joo and Ji-Gu. Yes he forgets his sister's birthday, but I think like many siblings, he expresses a deep respect for his sister in less obvious ways. There's a scene where he told Jun that he wanted to take out his anger on Woo-Joo, but couldn't because he realized he loved her. There was a moment when he regretted following his dreams and said he maybe should have studied more and taken the exam like his sister wanted. This I feel shows respect and admiration for how much she cared for him growing up, and it's a feeling I think siblings realize even greater as they grow older. Speaking from experience as someone who has a younger brother, lol. Oh, and also Ji-Gu playing the sweetest wingman in the last episode! \n\n**The feeling of loneliness, but not feeling alone.** The very beginning of the show opens beautifully with the words, \"To understand the loneliness of others, for me, that's the beginning of love.\" It's an incredibly sensitive and meaningful quote, and is one of the foundations for the show. Woo-Joo and Dong-Jin have several people around them who care for them. Even Jun, who lives his everyday life as a pharmacist but is constantly feeling alone under the pressures of his overbearing mother, realizes the loneliness of Woo-Joo resides in living her life with hate. Sun-Woo is constantly worrying about Dong-Jin and wants him to find happiness - even if that means Dong-Jin leaving the company he built with him. Hye-Sung who struggles with finding love soon realizes she's actually in love with someone who's always been there for her. Everyone suddenly feels lonely, but they are far from being alone. \n\nI also think the feeling of loneliness is emphasized not only through acting but also through the cinematography. Every shot, every angle feels like a documentary and the audience is peering into the character's lives. The long shots feel like time is frozen and you are living life with no particular pace, as one may feel when lonely. Every shot, every angle was taken with thought and detail. \n\n**The feelings of hate that can't drive out hate.** I like to think the show is the classic Romeo and Juliet story, but taken apart and revised with a less tragic and more sensible take in a modern setting. There are two feuding families that act as an obvious obstacle between Woo-Joo and Dong-Jin, but hate doesn't let them fall to their demise. Woo-Joo's love took over her hate, Dong-Jin couldn't bring himself to hate her for trying to take her revenge on him. There was a moment when Woo-Joo told Dong-Jin said she felt like she was walking backwards, because she was driven with hate, until she met him. Then there's Woo-Joo's mother showing her grace and class by not letting hate end things with Dong-Jin's mother. The only person who let himself go a little too far \"walking backwards\" was Dong-Jin's former boss losing himself when he wanted to take revenge on Dong-Jin by using Woo-Joo. Hate is undoubtedly a natural feeling but when kept for so long it ultimately only hurts us, and not the other person. \n\n\u2764\ufe0f This was such a beautifully crafted drama and it will always have a special place in my heart. All of the actors, director, editors and writers who worked on the show, and especially Kim Young Kwang and Lee Sung Kyung did an incredible job portraying their characters with their micro-expressions and raw emotion that felt so palpable through the screen. The show explored so many topics and feelings that resonated with me and I'm sure resonated with a lot of people. If you haven't seen this show I think you should definitely give it a try. You will feel all the feels, broaden your perspective and contemplate what it means to love and grow.",

This director loves cinema and wants us to love it just as much.  There are so many beautiful shots and so many times the framing is done in such a way as to convey loneliness or isolation or some other strong emotion that connects us to the onscreen character.\n\n2) the acting between all of the leads.  these relationships feel tender and precious and fragile and real because of how well they are portrayed.  Both Kim Young Kwang and Lee Sung Kyung are great at showing vulnerability and making us, the viewers, want to care and protect them.\n\nThis is definitely one of the best shows of 2023 so far and I hope more folks get a chance to watch it this year.",

I really loved that there wasn't a love triangle angle or a SML because that's so real life... it's hard to find one person let alone two. While going through so many reviews I found people who were annoyed with the slow pace, but I really enjoyed the slow pace of this show ..unlike Interest of Love, where I too was bothered with the pacing.. I suppose this is what sets dramas apart from each other, their ability to carry the audience. I could step into WooJoo's shoes and understand her journey. \n\nI don't think there's a single character arc or story I didn't enjoy or felt like no it shouldn't have been like this. Also, I am one of those who loved Haesung and Jun's romantic arc too...for someone like the two of them, I don't think that being alone and finding what they like is for them... I mean why don't we look at drama characters as real people? If I was Haesung I don't think I would have coped well being alone... with Suho and through that breakup Haesung realises that mistakes she's been making...but being alone for some for longer periods of time can't be healing but depressing, similar with Jun he tried blind dating and I don't think he too can be with someone who doesn't understand him or he them...he can't stand silence, Haesung is the epitome of noise and drama and likes rose tinted stuff...and more than Jun she needs someone who understands her, I don't think she's selfish...she too contributed to the family financially didn't she she was working.. just because she is dating multiple people doesn't mean she is selfish and enjoying life.... just like revenge drives WooJoo, being with someone to fill the silence drived Haesung... it's very selfish I suppose to call her the selfish sibling only because she isn't our FL. Both the sisters are messed up, and could only be with someone who can understand their mess and still love them just the same...we can clearly see that despite Dongjin and Minyoung being in a 7 year relationship he wasn't open with her there were still gaps... but WooJoo just like Minyoung in fact more has been a victim because of his mom but they understood each other more and were more suited...\n\nThis isn't really a review I suppose but I don't know I just wanted to write down my thoughts and feelings after watching the series.",

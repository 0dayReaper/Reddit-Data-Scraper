Wan ran away and ghosted him and he struggled.   That's also the root of his pushing Wan, he doesn't want him to run away again and even though he's uncomfortable Wan is standing up for himself.\n\nThat confession was great. Just direct about the past and his feelings. \ud83e\udd70  Hopefully next week they talk about their misunderstandings more.\n\nI'm bummed it's only 8 short episodes.   I'm already wishing it was longer, and regretting I didn't stumble onto this until the entire series was out.",

Ki Tae has been low key harassing Wan, but at last we've managed to see how he's felt these past seven years and how his \"harassment\" comes from the same place that Wan is uncomfortable with him: their unresolved issues.\n\nI enjoyed the confession of Gameboy's identity in the roof, almost mirroring the setting of their high school confession but the confession on the football pitch was incredibly well done, starting almost like a fight with Ki Tae in the end almost at the brink of tears.",

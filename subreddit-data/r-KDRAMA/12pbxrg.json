            "comment": "So San has actually never met the watchman. That's pretty cool, but eerie knowing that somebody's got your back but not knowing who. We also know he's never seen him because he specifically requested to meet with the watchman just to ask that he doesn't harm Dan O. Unless they throw us for a loop, the watchman is obviously Shi-yeol. \n\nThis is me theorizing, but I think Shi-yeol knew Dan-os sisters husband to be. \n\nI love all the aspects of this show except how Dan-O can be so thoughtless at times. She &gt;!openly asks about passage to Quing, knowing that the chief administrator is spying on her. She gives wayyyyy too much info, which has landed her being choked by the king. She's been pretty thoughtless about her actions and really hasn't shown bravery, cunning, or subtlety but rather acts first and thinks later.!&lt; I'm really hoping her character wises up.",

Always looks like they are meeting and talking openly where anyone can hear them. \n\nRegarding Shi Yeol, one theory was that he is the fianc\u00e9, second he killed the fianc\u00e9, he knows the song he used to sing and said he heard someone singing it a long time ago on the worst day of his life. I think this could support both theories. But if he is the fianc\u00e9, then he looks very different. Everyone does but Dan Oh looks the same. Third theory was the perpetual student is the old watchman who feels guilty that he killed her fianc\u00e9 and stays there to protect them. So lots of theories. \n\nAnd was the fianc\u00e9 a good guy or a bad guy?",

But because of the comments here saying that they didn't drag the \"jade dust\" reveal until the end I caught up and now I'm invested.\n\nSo, do we think the Jade Dust knows who the Watcher is? Since I had the benefit of knowing who the prince is I was watching the private interactions with the others closely and the only one who felt like a co-conspirator with him was &gt;!Yu Ha.!&lt; Though I still have not excluded &gt;!Shi Yeol!&lt; if the Watcher is supposed to be a secret guardian (or a group of secret guardians). His &gt;!clumsiness could be a shtick!&lt; to make him inconspicuous.\n\nAlso, I didn't catch if the Grand Prince was the brother of the King or of the deposed CP. I assumed of the King. It sounds like &gt;!Yu Ha!&lt; is the son of the Grand Prince with &gt;!the kibang hostess!&lt; which would make him the Jade Dust's uncle?\n\nAre all the pieces going to fall into place this week?",

Also i dont see why Kang San giving her the compass was such a big thing for you to gripe with in the first place. He actually gave half of it to her when he was a kid as a form of gratitude and the second part of it when he thought she was safe in hiding. I mean sure Dan O has made some dumb decisions but its not like shes born a scheming/cunning person, all she did was borne out of concern so could be put down to naivety. Supporting a cold blooded murderer just cos he is a tad bit smarter is rather morbid tbh \ud83d\ude05",

            "comment": "So I've somehow been acing picking dramas to binge lately. After thoroughly enjoying **My Country: The New Age** and **Hwarang**, I hit up KOCOWA again for **Tempted** (2018, 32/32). I'm already a sucker for Woo Do-Hwan, and his turn as ML Kwon Shi-Hyun in this drama based on *Dangerous Liaisons'* French original and its like - especially *Cruel Intentions* \\- is epic.\n\nThe DL framework is a solid dramatic base for this story but the tweaks definitely make it a kdrama, especially adding a string of problematic adults putting impossible pressure on their kids. In fact, whenever the plot seemed to stall, in would parachute a domestically abusive dad or grandpa or older brother to toss in more pathos.\n\nNone of the characters are clean, although the trio of Shi-hyun, Choi Soo-ji (Mun Ka-young) and Lee Se-joo (Kim Min-jae) rebels with reckless abandon, splashing their rich kid pain all over the place. If you've never seen any of the DL iterations, essentially they revolve around a plan between two practiced manipulators, Shi-hyun and Soo-ji in this case, to have Shi-hyun seduce the \"good girl\", Eun Tae-hee (Joy) and break her heart.\n\n**Tempted** manages to take that already sad framework and build a citadel of misery on top of it. The chemistry between all the leads is fire, as they're all just hot messes descended from other hot messes. Having some familiarity with the framework, I was getting more and more antsy about whether there'd be an HEA and whether it would be worth the pain to get there, but &gt;!there is and I'm still not sure if it was worth it because man it hurt.!&lt;\n\nOne of absolute favorite characters turned out to be Ko Kyung-joo (Jeong Ha-dam), Tae-hee's best friend. Kyung-joo is fresh and adorable but in a wonderfully pragmatic way, and she's just such a good person!\n\nEun Tae-hee is firmly in my Top 10 favorite FLs. She's strong, smart, supportive, and conveys a deep sense of dignity. She has limits and won't hesitate to defend herself, but she's not invulnerable; she grieves and moves on several times, and never sells her forgiveness and grace cheaply.\n\nSome wonderful supporting characters, especially the nursing home grannies. The second half of the series had a sad dearth of grannies! The finale also featured &gt;!probably the best use of a time skip I've seen; completely justified by the plot and actually welcomed, imo; they deserved a break!!&lt;\n\nGlad I finally picked this up and thank you to all the redditors who suggested **Tempted** as a good entry in my list of Woo Do-hwan vehicles. Maybe this will give me the strength to put up with Yoo Ri-ta long enough to finish **Blood**.",

Moon Ga Young did such a fantastic job of portraying her as a dysfunctional yet vulnerable teenager (and it totally lives up to - dare I say is even more nuanced - than Sarah Michelle Geller's OG portrayal). The one gripe I have with the show is that they kinda dilute her character towards the end and make her a \"crazy ex\" - and the redemption seemed a bit last-minute. I wish they had kept her character as complex and difficult to watch as they had in the first part of the series.",

I've been hearing about this one for so long, figured I'd watch it.\n\nSo far I really enjoy it because it's light and funny and as far as I know, there is no serial killer anywhere in sight.  \n\nI'm amazed at the difference between bare-face and pretty Lim Joo Gyung / Joo Bal.  I seriously think that I would not recognize them as being the same person if I meet them in the street.   I think the actress is also changing her expressions and the way she smiles between her two personas.  Pretty impressive.  \n\nAnd those glasses she wore in the very first episode.  Where the hell did they get such huge glasses?  \n\nFun fact. From someone who is nearly blind without glasses, I can tell you that the bigger the frame, the thicker the lenses have to be.  If glasses, that size really had a -8 correction, they would be the thickness of an old-fashioned Coke bottle.",

The songs on the show were good (Although an OST doesn't seem to exist, the male lead appears to be part of a band named infinite) and the story as well as the way it was shown was really interesting. 8 episodes in total 30 ish min each and every one felt both integral to the story and the character's development, basically 0 filler. The ending could've been polished a bit, I enjoy it's vagueness and its implications fit the theme of the show however it's the logic jump you need to make to get there that slightly ruins an otherwise near perfect show.  \n  \nOverall gave it a 7/10 but it could've easily been 8 had the ending been slightly tweaked like I mentioned earlier. Seems to be a bit of a hidden gem since it has very few reviews. Def a must watch if you like timeloop stories akin to \"Familiar Wife\"",

Up next is **Gu Family Book** before my Amazon Kocowa expires. Looks like a soap opera the way it was filmed, and unlikely to have any overcoats. Sigh.",

There is a couple of love triangles and I would have SLSyndrome if it werent for the fact that the main leads are so great.\n\nI enjoyed a scene where a tsundere type secondary character who bottles up his feelings and certainly never talks about them lets the other heartbroken character spew out her feelings over a bottle of soju, and the camera work on his face is telling you she's verbalising everything he's feeling too.  Just one example of the great scenes in this drama!\n\nQuite sad backstories but there is a nice touch of humour played through that keeps the drama reasonably light.",

I think it was just the first episode, I couldn't take it seriously and it was difficult for me to imagine Song Jong Ki as this mafia-type character. I felt that he didn't look the way his character should be (boy was I wrong once his acting proved his worth). It wasn't until a few weeks ago that I saw edits from the show, and \\*ahem\\* particularly the villain &gt;! (including the plot twist with the \"big bad\" reveal) !&lt; , which led me to give the show another shot (even with knowing the spoiler). \n\nI have to say, I am really impressed with SJK, Jeon Yeo Been's, Ok Taecyeon's, and Kwak Dong-Yeon's acting. They really made the show what it is! Not only that, I am now a huge fan of Jeon Yeo Been and Ok Taecyeon, and I kinda want them to work together again in future projects (Their behind-the-scenes interactions and the Netflix interviews showed how well they work together, and the fact that they had worked in a previous project before!). This show had it all, the acting, the ost, the cinematography, and the amazing writing that tied it all together! I'm kinda lost now after finishing the show, I have no idea what to watch or how to move on \ud83d\udc80",

I liked the horror mystery aspects of the first couple of episodes but now that they\u2019ve done the villain reveal and the leads have gotten together, everything is just\u2026 OK. \n\nI am still enjoying learning about the Korean pantheon, folklore and myths. But the plot feels  very derivative of Harry Potter, of all things!\n\nI came to this series via the magnetism of Kim Bum, and he doesn\u2019t disappoint. I will see this through to the end, and probably watch the sequel, just for him. His character is hands down the best thing about this show.",

Over and over again people plot something, fight someone, then in the next episode it starts again but with the alliances changed. I don't know how many times I heard (sometimes the same) characters say \"Kill them all\" and spoiler alert: all were not killed.\r  \n\r  \nThe romance was RIDICULOUS, why was it there at all??? I've never seen such a pointless, chemistry-less romance plot in dramas ever. Hee Jae character literally brought nothing to the story, I still don't get why she was there at all. In later episodes, whenever she was on the screen I fast forwarded because just seeing her made me bored. \r  \n\r  \nThe bromance was good, although also repetitive in terms of we're friends / we're enemies / we're friends again, on and on it goes. But at least watching them always finding their way back to the friendship and protecting each other in any circumstances was kinda satisfying - in a sense that at least something in this drama of constant betrayal was solid.\r  \n\r  \nTheir super healing abilities have been mentioned already many times, &gt;!but I still giggle thinking that maybe in the last episode they also eventually got up, took out the arrows from their bodies and continued living, lol. !&lt;",

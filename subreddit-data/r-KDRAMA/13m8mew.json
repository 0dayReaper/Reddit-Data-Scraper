The plot is mediocre, sometimss they choose to zigzag in storytelling, it confuses me cause I'm more into a red line pacing. \n\nSo for instance FL was brushed off by one of the ML, the one who reminds her of the ex.  The previous episode ended with him taking sides with the mean girl. Next episode - Normal scene interaction, (FL and that ML) as if nothing has happend and later on we get reminded what happend in the previous episode and things get a bit clearified, not for the FL, but for us viewers. I don't understand the reasoning behind that editing but it didn't make sense and was confusing. \n\nCute story. Simple. Short episodes. Typical Korean webdrama.",

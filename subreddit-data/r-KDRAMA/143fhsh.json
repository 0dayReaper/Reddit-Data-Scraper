Yoojae literally went from lets date to 100 day anniversary in the space of 2 mins. i still fully believe Yoojae just wanted a friend and somehow forced himself into dating him to not lose him but anyway thats another story for another day. This show literally went from an 8 to a 5 in the space of 30 mins.",

Why did he throw the chocolates in the garbage bin? Did he kiss HanJoon coz he wanted to or coz he didn't want to lose him? What happened after the kiss? What happened after the 'Let's date'? We didn't even get to see the joy of his love being reciprocated on HanJoon's face! !&lt;\n\nA story should be told properly. What's the point of leaving major incidents to the audience' imagination? Why even tell a story if you don't have the time to do justice to it? Aaaargh! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd2c",

But if you compare those same moments to the ones in \u201cThe eighth sense\u201d they are miles away.\n\nI was expecting a flashback &gt;! Developing the kissing scene, or the \u201clet\u2019s date\u201d scene, as we had the one on the high school argument !&lt; but nop, they waste the last 15 minutes with a family drama out of nowhere.\n\nAnyway, It\u2019s short and engaging with solid performances and ok photography, but they could have been bolder in the last leg of the drama.",

The conflict at the end didn\u2019t quite work either as Hae Joon had previously disappeared for specific reasons. If anything, I\u2019d expected Yoo Jae\u2019s character to be more concerned about Hae Joon\u2019s wellbeing since he\u2019d completely dropped off grid for no reason after saying he\u2019d be there. \n\n Overall the pacing of the show was a let down but I\u2019m glad I watched this as Kim In Sung was fantastic. I\u2019ll sign up for any of his future shows.",

            "comment": "Such a shame that they built up all that tension in episode 6 and the series just kind of deflated in a rush of jumbled plot. The last two episodes were very well acted but it was too much too fast in terms of the progression of time and it lacked any nuance/context. I felt badly for the two leads, who I think could have done well with more story and even just one episode exploring the immediate aftermath of episode 6, the transition from friends to something more, etc. \n\nI kind of want to read the source material to get the full story. Or I would take a season 2 that was more like TMS2, where things get more room to breathe (Kim Insung and Zuho, I\u2019d watch you again, and maybe this time FNC would let you kiss, Zuho). \n\nAh well, I\u2019ll probably watch again through like minute 5 of episode 7 and leave the series at that!",

It's like they turned him into a paper character with zero depth going on.  Just a person on a script.   \nDisappointing.",

A main character in the show, more often than not, will have a sucker for their scenes and I absolutely can't stand it haha. And like there is a story backed reason as to why the character has the suckers but just the sounds of the sucker hitting their teeth, the like general sucker sounds, the need for the character to constantly remove the sucker to say their lines(if I even get that lucky) irritate me to no end. I've powered through so far and will most certainly finish it but only for Lee Chungah and Seolhyun.\n\nHave you guys seen the Japanese drama \"First Love\"? It's on Netflix for me and i'm about halfway through it and LOVING IT! It's so freaking good.",

In the drama, the assistant often served nurungji in a bowl of water/broth, it looked like soupy rice and reminded me of my favourite Japanese dish *ochazuke*. \n\nSo last night, I accidentally burnt some rice in the pot (I blame **Designated Survivor: 60 Days** for this). No rice cooker and don't eat rice that often so I'd usually just cook them in the pot. Then without thinking, I just left the pot to soak in the water, instead of finding ways to extract that burnt rice to make nurungji. Sigh, I'd been wanting to make nurungji for days, then when a happy accident occurred I just let it go to waste. Stupid.",

But TLDR; great gripping political thriller. Serious, but not so much - you can still do other things during it (just maybe not cooking, esp in the later episodes) and follow the story. The political side of things were explained well enough for me, someone who has no interest in politics at all, to understand what was going on. Highly recommend!\n\nBtw Unnie, I got to watch both seasons of **Missing: The Other Side** a couple weeks or so ago! So good! I agree with you, I'll never stop watching if they decide to go for more seasons. There seemed to be a hint of more at the end of season 2. I hope they'll go for it!",

            "comment": "Hi all! I'm curious about slow back-patting in kdramas - is it a reflection of Korean culture or is it something unique to kdramas? It has come up in a bunch of different shows I've watched and based on the situations, music, and camerawork, it seems like it's a very intimate display of care. It's not something I've witnessed outside of these shows and at first I thought it was quite unusual. Anyway, any insight is welcomed!",

Is it just me that's moved on or is quality control an issue all round due to the sheer volume of shows being produced. \n\nI got a long flight next week so I think I need to plan my journey entertainment ahead of time.

I don\u2019t have expectations for anything really, not just dramas. I am just here to experience things as they happen.\n\nI do get being confused about 25/21 since the characters were 23 and 19 for most of the show, iirc. But that\u2019s just wondering why that title was chosen, not feeling betrayed by it or anything.\n\nDo you have expectations for things and do you care about show titles? \n\nMy husband and I do use descriptions of shows to decide if we want to watch them or not, like we love ridiculous campy stuff and we\u2019ll pass on something that seems intense and dramatic and has a lot of people being constantly mean. \n\nUncle is one of the only two dramas we\u2019ve ever dropped because the awful mothers were more active and present and unrelenting than the mothers in CCIR and we couldn\u2019t handle it. Had to take a long break from Mental Coach Jegal for similar reasons and we only picked it back up after I saw people saying it ended okay.\n\nAnyway, I guess I can understand if I think that the murder in some romances is to other people what constant meanness and awfulness is to us. \n\nStill though, I guess I just don\u2019t think about stories in terms of genres and categories, because it doesn\u2019t bother me or register at all as something \u201coff\u201d for a show to have sweet silly scenes and also scenes of murder or whatever.",

                    "comment": "For me, instead of having expectations for a show based on its title, it does tend to frame how I see the show differently.  For example, watching Beyond Evil I tended to notice more specifically evil events/acts throughout the show based on that title.  However, the original Korean title translates directly to \"Monster,\" and watching the show with that mindset I noticed more how various characters behaved like monsters at different points throughout the show.  The show itself calls attention to this fact by projecting the word \uad34\ubb3c (monster) across certain characters at specific moments.  It's a subtle difference, but knowing the Korean title shifted how the show made sense in my head.\n\nThere's also the factor of titles that are translated with even bigger differences in meaning for the purpose of appealing to the international audience.  Crash Course In Romance's original Korean title translates more directly to something like \"Star Teacher Scandal.\"  Knowing this going in, it didn't seem as surprising that the show started shifting away from emphasizing romance at a certain point, because it frames the show not as a show about romance, but a show about a scandal.\n\nAnother example I can think of comes from a comment I read either discussing the webtoon or drama version of True Beauty (been a while, can't remember which).  The commenter was upset because the title \"True Beauty\" led them to believe that the show would shift away from focusing on changing outer appearance with make-up to embracing one's own inner beauty, and this did not in fact happen.  I have not read enough of the webtoon or seen the drama yet myself, so I don't know the specific details involved with this particular drama.  However, I found it interesting that the Korean title translates more directly as \"The Goddess Descends.\"  Because the Korean title has no juxtaposition of inner vs outer beauty, people who are aware of the original title are not led to watch the show with this mindset.  However, the international title does lead viewers to frame the show with the theme of \"true\" beauty in mind (whatever true beauty means to them).\n\nIt's interesting to see how different titles work or don't work for the story being told, and how they affect peoples' overall experiences with them.  I think it's cool that the show's title doesn't affect your enjoyment.  It means that you're more able to enjoy shows whether they fit their titles well or not!",

But that\u2019s just wondering why that title was chosen, not feeling betrayed by it or anything.\n\nAs I understand it, there is a well-known Korean pop song by [Jaurim](https://www.moinnet.com/en/translated-lyrics/jaurim-twenty-five-twenty-one/) called \"Twenty Five Twenty One\", which won \"Best Modern Pop Song\" in 2014, off an album that won \"Best Modern Rock Album\", so, a big deal even if it was almost a decade ago. The song is about &gt;!nostalgia for young love!&lt;, and the lyrics of the refrain are, &gt;!\"What I thought would be forever, Twenty Five Twenty One.\"!&lt; So, if you were Korean, and you heard there was a drama called Twenty Five Twenty One, you would likely have an association to the song, even though the characters in the drama might not be exactly the same age. You also most likely would not be surprised by &gt;!the ending of the drama!&lt;.",

First watched it when it was released, which was 10 years ago! \ud83e\udd2f That explains why I only remember the first half of it. Back then I still don't know any streaming sites so we watched The Heirs via dvd that I borrowed from a friend. Now, I can just click on Netflix to watch it. Rewatching The Heirs made me realize how their still 18 yet their lives were so complicated \ud83d\ude2d like pls Chairman, the two were just in love \ud83d\ude2d lol. Still waiting for my turn to have a tall, handsome, and heir tho",

Then the drama takes a turn into a tragic backstory for a couple of episodes. Namkoong Min's performance is masterful in both moods. After returning to the present though, the drama never quite recovers its balance. The ending is weird - maybe trying to leave the door open for a second season? I read that there were problems within the production team and it shows.\n\nGaus Electronics on the other hand is consistently funny all the way through. I did find the humor in the first episode a little too cruel but after that it was great.",

Some people on this sub thought the team wanted to take advantage of the popularity to spin out a second season so they changed the plot in order to wrap up sooner. But there were also rumors the screenwriter had a falling out with the production team. Either way, the story really suffered in the last few episodes. This was particularly frustrating because the drama had shown so much promise in the beginning, and Namkoong Min is such a good actor.",

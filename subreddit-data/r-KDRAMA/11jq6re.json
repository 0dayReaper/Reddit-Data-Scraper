I cried for like 2 hours and then woke up and cried again. Before you ask \"first time?\" yes first time lmao \ud83d\ude2d I was so used to Korean rom-coms wrapping things up in a less devastating way and this is the first time getting my face completely kicked in\n\nTips and tricks for overcoming secondhand heartbreak very welcome",

Especially if they've been on Running Man or 1N2D because these appearances are lighthearted and often involve some bit of clumsiness due to the game nature of the show, which helps 'shatter' lingering intensity from their roles.\n\nWhat I don't do is move onto other dramas/films in their filmography immediately because I usually have a hard time immersing myself into the new role and tend to bring emotions from the old one into the new one, which can make for wonky viewing experiences.",

At what point does the slower parts that feel dragging end and the show picks up? It's a gorgeous drama with amazing actors and lovely costumes (history nerd here and love shows about empresses) so I really wanna finish it at least once in my life despite how long it is.",

It also drags in the middle part quite a lot. My only tip for the beginning is to try to pay full attention to the Daecheong Island plotline (episodes 3-4) because that will pay off later. Things pick up around the point where Seung-nyang arrives at the Imperial court. \n\nYou'll learn which plot lines you don't really care for and there's no shame in skipping those parts if it gets you back to the good stuff! For me, that was a lot of the battle scenes/non-Imperial-palace-or-adjacent scenes. Please let me know what you think and especially which pairing you root for lol. It's been almost a week and I still haven't been able to pick anything else up because I've been rewatching my favorite scenes.",

A wonderful time was had by all and much food was devoured, then we went to H Mart and secured our banana milk and I got these ice cream sandwich type things in the shape of a fish and they are delicious! I always get decision fatigue in the Ramen isle though. Too many options and I freeze up! I just end up buying whichever Ramen has the cutest cartoon chicken on it. \n\nThe steamed egg is the greatest food ever invented. That's my summary!\n\nEdit to say that the cashier at H Mart also told us to check out the new song \"On the Street\", a J- Hope collab with J. Cole. It's stuck in my head now.",

Underrated gem highly recommend.\n\nStarted **Lovers of the Red Sky**, I remember it coming out but never paid attention then it popped in a recommend in MDL for a cdrama I finished, so I was like ok give it a try. Had no idea it was a supernatural one! Totally missed the boat, it reminds me of Mirror the Witch and I'm all in\n\nBUT\n\nSo I started it, just clicked episode one, and it was like one of those special episodes behind the scenes, etc. and I was oh ok carry on then, and skipped onto 2 watched to episode 5 went to hockey, got back thought I'd watch one more episode realized I had completely skipped episode 1.....went back and watched it, made much more sense then....not sure why Viki did me dirty like that....",

Korean woman accused of stabbing 3 after being called 'ajumma'\"** at https://us.yahoo.com/news/37-old-korean-woman-accused-194016094.html\n\n&gt;The word \u201cajumma,\u201d a casual way to refer to a middle-aged woman of no relation, has become an offensive term through the years.\n&gt;\n&gt;The word, which came from the more polite term \u201cajumeoni,\u201d has reportedly developed a negative connotation that describes someone who can be seen as \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cself-centered,\u201d such as in scenarios where a middle-aged woman pushes another person out of the way.\n\n**Have you come across this offensive use of \u201cajumma\u201d in a K-drama?**\n\nI remember a scene from Ep. 35 of \"The King's Doctor\" aka \"Horse Doctor\" when Ka-young (the irreverent assistant of Kwang-hyun) referred to Princess Su-khi's court attendant as an \"ajumma.\" The flustered attendant kept insisting to Princess Su-khi that she wasn't the \"ajumma\" that Ka-young referred to. In this scene, the attendant seemed to be saying that she wasn't that old to be called an \"ajumma.\"\n\n**Note:** \"The King's Doctor\" was a 2013 pan-Asian hit starring Cho Seung-woo as the ML and Lee Yo-won as the FL. I recommend this historical drama to you, especially if you're a fan of Kim So-eun; you will love her portrayal of Princess Su-khi.\n\nEpisode intro of \"The King's Doctor\" at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=utzs7_BbQ_8",

Then I pause around the part where the main conflict escalates and I move to another drama.  \n\nI have 10 like that right now.  7 if you ignore the ones that are currently airing.  \n\nIs there a self-help group or something?",

Taron Egerton did wonderful, but everyone, Paul Walter Hauser. Brilliant performer. He always gets cast as a gross person, but his acting is beyond incredible. Riveting. The wonderfully creepy nuanced performance in this really scratched the dark kdrama itch",

Cha Seung-won puts in a fantastic performance. Dated production values and the first couple of episodes are a little shaky but worth powering through to get to the good stuff.",

It was already super memorable in the [first season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfzStIaxhmE) and fit so well with his character, and now for this [second season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F4jg9To53I), they kept the same music but changed the lyrics in such a beautiful way. It immediately made me sentimental again. What a wonderful job they did with this \ud83d\udc95",

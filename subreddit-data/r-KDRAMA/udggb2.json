I can't find many now but here's a quote from one article:\n&gt; crucial bits had been left out, such as Kim's requests to Seo, who was shooting a different drama, to not film kiss scenes. \"So Seo Yea-ji also told him, 'Then you shouldn't do it either',\"\n\nAnd then a bunch of text messages leaked that show her in a bad light and \"exposing her\" but to be honest, the could've been similar conversations before that when he was \"being controlling\" as well. \n\nIt's easier for guys to get away with scandals. Just look at the actor who played ML for Mr Sunshine. No one really cares. \n\nMy guess is he was being controlling and petty so So Ye ji just gave him back the same energy. This is ironic because in IONBO, the public called her a bitch for giving back the same energy ass holes gave (bookstore scene). Then the same exact thing happened in real life. It just seemed like a very petty spat between two people that just happened to get publicized and Kim Jung-hyun happened to be smarter about it. I loved him in Mr. Queen, CLOY and Waikiki. They're both fantastic actors and I will still look forward to any drama they're going to be in without a second thought about their stupid lovers quarrel. \n\nJust my opinion",

Oh god \n\nSo what? How people act in their personal relationships is none of others concern. And we don't even know how much the extent of that prohibition was , or if media just blew it out of proportion\n\nI expected something tame anyways given that it's a korean controversy, but this is a LOT tamer than i expected lol \n\nI feel bad for seo ye ji.. she's my favourite actress because of IOTNBO  but in korea, women celebs are judged a lot harsher than men. And its not like men arent judged harshly either so yeah. Sad\n\nI'm looking forward to this project",

SYJ isn\u2019t able to score A (or B-list) co-stars now because few of them are willing to tie their careers to hers. Her drama is also not slotted for the Fri-Sat-Sun slot, which is where networks book their most promising dramas with the biggest stars.\n\n**The lack of industry enthusiasm (especially on the co-star front) will become the biggest barrier to her career, not domestic or international reception**. Compare her co-star pre-scandal (Kim Nam Gil) to her co-stars now (Idk who these actors are).",

I was disappointed by all the \u201cman up\u201d and \u201ccall yourself a man\u201d comments made by SYJ fans directed at her ex boyfriend who as far as I could see had a nervous breakdown. If women wish to end toxic masculinity then we should maybe apply the same standards to women\u2019s behaviour. For the record I\u2019m a woman. \n\nAnyway I guess I\u2019ll get a lot of downvotes now (sigh).

It could be that he/ his agency are making up excuses, but it could also be that he was telling the truth. He said he wasn't being manipulated and that SYJ wasn't the reason he pulled out of the show he was doing. We don't know these people, so we can only go on statements they release or what gossip sites publish. Both can lie or embellish the truth, but I'd be more inclined to believe the actors' statements over dispatch.\n\nAlso, the events happened three years before dispatch dug up those text messages and published them and the relationship was long over. They didn't do Kim Jung Hyun any favors. They just wanted to create a scandal, which is what they do best.",

The Dispatch report came with a series of text messages between Seo Ye-ji and Kim Jung-hyun, where the actress was referring to him as \"Kim Stiff\" and telling him to avoid physical contact (or \"skinship\") with female staff and his Time leading lady Seohyun even if it meant having to request to modify the script. \n\n&gt; According to Dispatch, Seo Ye-ji constantly asked Kim Jung-hyun to send her audios and videos to monitor him on the set of his drama. A staff member of Time also reportedly said that Kim Jung-hyun was constantly on his phone at the time and even confirmed that he indeed kept asking for changes in the script on the set, saying, \"He stressed the importance of platonic love and asked to have any physical contact taken out. If things didn't go his way, he would suddenly run outside and start gagging.\"\n\n&gt; his co-star Seohyun, who was reportedly humiliated and brought to tears several times because of how he badly treated her. Back then, their press conference for Time became controversial because he was very emotionless and obviously avoiding physical contact with Seohyun.\n\nA lot of people (including on Reddit) continue to condemn him for his actions (he did not want to touch Seohyun). But I have to be honest. That dude was clearly in an abusive relationship. He was gagging at the thought of his girlfriend finding out that there would be physical contact. I just feel sorry for him. Just go look at any photos of the two of them. That dude was broken.",

Or if the gender roles were reversed too.\n\nBullying takes a toll on victims heavily, it is something they carry throughout the rest of their lives. Many take their lives because of it. I don't know the severity of this individuals actions but bullying is bullying. Seeing someone who bullied you be protected and not once apologise or admit their actions? Imo it would be different if the individual admitted their actions, apologised to victims and accept the consequences or if they are innocent, fight for their innocence but here it doesn't seem like the case. \n\nIt's sad because when someone is in the spotlight or is aesthetically beautiful, people turn a blind eye towards this. I usually would seperate professional and personal life, but with these kind of actions they mix in together, in my opinion it's hard to and it kind of gives you a slight insight on the person's character. Yes, there may be other people affecting/partly behind the choices by the actress, but ultimately she can decide; it's her life and career. \n\nSadly with these things and people in the spotlight, it feels like they're only sorry they got caught.",

My ex was an aspiring actor and abusive toward me. If you asked me if he should ever have a wife or kids my response to that would be \u201chell no.\u201d But if I found out the studio or theater he was working for kicked him out simply because of the way he treated me, my only response to that would be \u201cwhy?\u201d What does it have to do with working on set? Especially if he\u2019s cordial to the other actors and staff, and does his job correctly?\n\nWhen we call for people like that to be cancelled or fired, what do we expect them to do next? Have no job at all? Work at some office job or at a cafe? What\u2019s the difference between an acting job and an \u201caverage\u201d job? All we care about is that we don\u2019t see them anymore; out of sight out of mind? It\u2019s still a job and they\u2019re still a human. \n\nForcing a bad person out of their job like this feels like trying to bully them out of being a bully. I\u2019m not defending actions like that at all and I applaud any victim that speaks up about it. What I find a step too far is the immediate need to tear their life to shreds and deride anyone that dares to like their work.",

That's when categorizing by type and simple labels is not sufficient. Because severity and motivation definitely do matter. \n\nSo all bullying, sexual assault and abuse can't be seen as the same. It would be insulting and, ultimately, harmful to suggest that they are, especially to people who have suffered the very worst examples.\n\nBut regarding curiosity, nosiness and opinions? Fine, they may be elements of human nature. But they aren't a decent excuse for people acting as judge,  jury, and seekers of vengeance... especially in cases that are not their own.

When the allegations came to light he had the lead role in the series River Where the Moon Rises, but the episodes were reshot with a different actor. He then enlisted in the military for his compulsory national service but he must have nearly finished and so I was wondering if he would be given another chance - or whether his career as an actor is over. Some of the allegations were very bad.",

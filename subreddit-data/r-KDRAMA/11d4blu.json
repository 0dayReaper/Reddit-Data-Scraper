The ending was rushed and they probably needed two more episode to flesh out some stories but they tied it up decently with what they had.  The female lead is a great actress and damn beautiful.  Reminds me of meryl streep in the devil wears prada.  The supporting cast was good too, nothing notable but didn\u2019t take away from the story. Naeun did a decent job, but I don\u2019t think her character was developed enough. \n\nOverall i give agency a 7/10.  Crash course is a 5.5/10",

Interesting thing is that there is no real ML. I didn\u2019t finish yet because there\u2019s no subs on last 2 episodes yet. Worth watching.

            "comment": "I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the discussion over in the on-airs this past week for **Crash Course in Romance**. There\u2019s been some consensus about misplaced genre expectations (at least amongst non-Korean speaking fans) due to the English title of the show and how it was marketed, and while that maybe true I think for shows that we all love a lot upfront, in the moment we can be forgiving of missed steps if there\u2019s an episode or two that make up for the episodes that may have drawn criticism. \n\nI know I lose a little bit of objectivity if I really love a show because the bottom line should always be whether you\u2019re enjoying a show or not, however, I feel like with the last episode being a good coming together and blend of genres, for me the weaker episodes stood out all the more. I\u2019ve seen enough KDramas to know that more often than not heavy romance shows will blend in other genres/elements (i.e adding the \u201cdrama\u201d to it so to speak) so I was personally not against the mix of genres the show is/was trying to be, but I do think in trying to establish the various plots, in a few episodes in the middle they faltered with the blending and more cohesive storytelling/editing. The actors, backdrop and main source material they were working with is so rich already with so much to be explored that I think that that\u2019s what threw at least me off when the blending was not being done very well. \n\nI also think the \u201cmissteps\u201d become more glaring on a week to week basis due to the recency effect\u2026perhaps on a binge it won\u2019t at all!\n\nEither way I am sad that next weekend is the finale weekend. The show had become my weekend-doesn\u2019t-progress-until-I\u2019ve-seen-the-episode-first show, although I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s one that I\u2019ll gravitate towards wanting to rewatch. \n\nEdit: grammar and structure.

            "comment": "I didn't quite enjoy the time travel genre in kdrama. Will briefly explain why\r\n\r\n**1. Kairos:** Concept wise, as a cross between signal and God's gift 14 days, it wasn't highly interesting. Time skip wasn't creatively used esp with repeated plots of &gt;!dying and surviving again and preventing deaths with each reset!&lt;. It was exciting at first, but soon lost the suspense factor for me. **Reset** did better with the repetitive plot. \r\n\r\nEnjoyed the lipstick secretary and psycho bitch's characters, they were interesting and added spice to the typical boring plot of kind-hero-fighting-injustice. Still the best one out there. \r\n\r\n**2. Signal:** tbh nothing in particular stood out for me other than that terrible ending. The concept was fresh and the crime cases were interesting, but as a procedural thriller, the investigation style fell flat for me. Deduction style was overly based on assumptions and crucial clues would always be found suddenly at the convenient time right after building the suspense. Duh\r\n\r\n**3. God's gift 14 days:** The only drama that respected and properly used the time element. It really ruins my immersion when dramas casually change the past as if events aren't variable and linked in a chain lol. But this one stayed true to the concept and kept future events unchanged, ie, maintained - similar if not the same thing must happen despite the changes made in the past. Strong structure, but failed in filling it up with 'reasonable' plots. The plots are very twisty, but existed only for moving the drama forward.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, I enjoyed the cdramas more despite having simpler story\r\n\r\n**4. reset:** the entire drama is about a short bus ride ending up in explosion in loops. The outcomes were known, but it was exciting and suspenseful to think how the events were going to unfold. It did become predictable in last few episodes, still it was interesting. \r\n\r\n**5. the heart of genius:** time travel and parallel universe logic was handled very smoothly. No suspenseful or complex plots, a simple family centered slice of life like drama. Favorite one so far. \r\n\r\nWill love some good recommendations :)",

It handles the hurdles of time-travel mechanics pretty well IMO. I'd describe it as a rags-to-riches, revenge, chaebol drama with time-travel as a central element.",

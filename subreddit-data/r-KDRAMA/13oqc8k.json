Then again I'm wondering if she cut it to stand out from the other 3 actresses. &gt;! Seeing the footage of Jae Yi tampering with the drinks, it's too obvious.  She didn't even stand in front of the table, but to the side.  !&lt;Everyone in the room would've been able to see what she was doing.\n\nI am loving how Song Je Hyeon's sweet smile is exactly the same as his evil smile.  He's one of those evil guys I love to hate.  And are Yoo Na's red talon nails a warning for us as the viewer of just what she might be capable of re protecting her child and fighting SJH.  There certainly are a lot of close ups of her hands/nails.  hmmm.\n\nThe moment when the 4 women&gt;! came together around the campfire was so good.  I can't wait to see what they have planned and why Jae Yi's dropping out of the race, along with what Hae Mi's mother is thinking of.  Seems like she's got a plan too.!&lt;\n\nI notice the ratings for this are creeping up each week.  I am finding it better and better as the story comes together.  The makjang music is tiring, but that's part of the package I suppose.",

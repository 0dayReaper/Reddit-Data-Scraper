But for this trailer, idk about the revolutionary/uprising thing going on. \n\nIt was even amazing on the manhwa because the kid is just a kid in the first half of the manhwa, and becomes an adult by the end.

                    "comment": "Most global tv shows, not just KDrama land, are much behind to Hollywood when it comes to CGI in general. \n\nCGI needs time and money. US has a 30 year head-start, because [Hollywood CGI era basically started with Terminator 2](https://youtu.be/37YrnLbQda0), and now that one looks dated but it was a pretty big deal in 1991 for how realistic it looked back then. And money, because frankly, KDramas\u2019 visually have not looked really modern/contemporary to Hollywood ones until Netflix started funding them, they could not secure enough funds before. \n\nFor example, I consider Signal one of the greatest KDrama of all time, but if you compare it with Hollywood dramas it looks like it came out of early 2000s, not out of 2016. But it\u2019s not really fair to be compared to expensive series that took years to make, it should be compared to series of the same budget and took around the same amount of time to make. And when you take this in consideration, you get a better appreciation of how good it is, it went far and beyond. This in general is something that KDramas excel at; they produce many good series under lots of limitations.",

High costs + fast turnaround times = poor quality CG. \n\nWith the way most kdramas are filmed (filming concurrently with airing) it\u2019s even worse for anyone working in post (editors, sfx, etc.). \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if more shows split their season up to give more time to finish special effects, either.",

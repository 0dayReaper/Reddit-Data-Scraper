The drama is ok I like it not bad but I am super annoyed with the character Haesoo like she cant stop going about revenge and the funny thing is she kept asking why and needed answers but never hears Taera's reasoning just simply cut off and leave like bruv she about to tell you and ure actually making it harder for yourself",

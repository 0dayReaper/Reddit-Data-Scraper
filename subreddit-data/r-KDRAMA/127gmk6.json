Contents of those chatrooms would circle around and very disturbing happenings with detailed descriptions were everywhere. I had to take a step back at some point, because it was affecting me too much. It was also the headline for months in South Korea. There were demonstration and everything. As I watched the last two episodes and was reminded of that whole fiasco, I went to check the sentencing and I was blown away by how ridiculous they were. Most of the sentencing ended up being about drug charges. And all under 5 years. Honestly I want some real good revenge sequence happening next episode for me to feel at least some satisfaction, even though the justice was never served.",

From what we have gathered he was a runway who was picked by that cult like organisation, no one has ever been nice to him and he literally can't comprehend why the Taxi team would be doing what they are doing. On another hand, he is an unhinged murderer. So yeah.\n\n- It's amazing how many passes I give this show for a failing logic at times. Really. The show doesn't take itself seriously, it's basically the power fantasy at this point. I don't really mind. My expectations is that the show remains entertaining, easy to watch and that the bad guys will be taught a lesson.

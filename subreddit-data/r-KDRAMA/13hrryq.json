            "comment": "&gt;*\u201cThe backyard smells like a dead body\u201d*\n&gt;\n&gt;Joo Ran (Kim Tae Hee) grew up in a wealthy family. She is now a housewife and married to Jae Ho (Kim Sung Oh), who works as a doctor. They live in a house with a yard. Joo Ran is happy and lives an ideal life. Her peaceful daily life is abruptly shook when she notices a strange smell in her backyard. This leads to Joo Ran eventually investigating her husband and meeting Sang Eun. \n&gt;\n&gt;Sang Eun (Lim Ji Yeon) lives a completely different life from Joo Ran. She grew up in a poor environment and, even now, suffers from financial difficulties. She lives in a shabby rented apartment with her husband Yoon Beom (Choi Jae Rim). Yoon Beom works for a pharmaceutical company. Sang Eun is subject to domestic violence by her husband Yoon Beom. Her life is completely miserable. One day, she receives a phone call that Yoon Beom is dead.\n\n[Source](https://asianwiki.com/House_with_a_Yard)",

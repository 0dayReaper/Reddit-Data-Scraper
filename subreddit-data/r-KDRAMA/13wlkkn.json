This is my first drama seeing Zuho, and he's the more seasoned of the two, but I think In Sung is acting circles around him. Zuho's serious face is sort of weird, like murdery.....he'd be a good fit for Killing Stalking.",

            "comment": "Despite some odd editing choices (especially the jump in 6 from the cafe to the class party), both episodes were deeply moving. In classic Kdrama form, there\u2019s a lot that is going unsaid and potentially being misunderstood, but there is also a shocking amount of honesty here, too. My heart was shattering *again* by the end of the two episodes!\n\nFirst heartache was the &gt;!broken box of chocolates on the bookshelf!&lt;. Second twinge was yoojae saying &gt;!if you really liked me (cared about me) how could you just disappear on me like that? !&lt;, which is, in my opinion a fair point to raise. Hanjoon has his reasons, but Yoo Jae clearly has some big hangups around abandonment and needing to be the only/most important.\n\n(Speaking of, the jealousy and the not so subtle twinge of possessiveness, I shouldn\u2019t like it\u2026.but I do\u2026&gt;!the whole cafe scene with the laptop and the fury over hyung\u2026yoo jae is definitely no green flag kind of love interest but he\u2019s so interesting).\n\nIn between heartaches, I lol\u2019d at Zuho singing one of his popular old songs, which apparently includes a lot of lyrics about his cat, Huru, who kisses him and walks on his keyboard. There\u2019s more sf9 in this show than I would have expected. \n\nAnd the lastly\u2026I didn\u2019t think the end of episode 4 could be topped for angst and yearning, but this one did it. The acting was really great, the BGM was moving and when Hanjoon said &gt;!I\u2019m swayed every time you act and i imbue everything with meaning so that I\u2019m always fantasizing alone\u2026.if that isn\u2019t the perfect summation of unrequited love, I don\u2019t know what is. It makes me ache. !&lt;\n\nAnd as for the &gt;!kiss, I don\u2019t mind trick shots like that, there\u2019s enough genuine tension in the relationship and chemistry that I\u2019ll take a long distance angle over an awkward lip press any day. !&lt;\n\nSad that it will be ending next week.",

He also wants to touch his \"best friend\" whenever he feels like it. He wants to cuddle whenever he wants, and he wants Hanjoon to sleep with him on the same bed whenever he feels like it. His feelings will be hurt if Hanjoon refuses to let him do these things. \n\nOn the other hand, Hanjoon is not allowed to date a male or a female. He is not allowed to flirt with anyone and he is not allowed to even be friendly or close to any female or male other than Yoojae himself. Basically he wants him to remain a virgin with no friends and stay with him till death do them part \ud83d\ude06\n\nI wonder though why the Senior (forgot his name) was asking Hanjoon about Yoojae. It seemed strange to me for him to be interested whether or not Yoojae joins the club. I hope it doesn't turn out that he is interested romantically in Yoojae. I would prefer if he or another guy fall seriously for Hanjoon and start approaching him clearly and openly. It would be fun to see how Yoojae would react.",

I interpreted  \"Hyung's\" interest in Yoo Jae as - *oh, he's so popular, wouldn't it be great if he joined our club and made our club popular, too?*  If he were interested in Yoo Jae romantically, I think he would have made more of an effort to approach him in the hallway when Yoo Jae was with Han Joon.

I guess this will be about the three main leads (they are doing an amazing job) struggling and rising to power in that time.\n\nThe tanning make up thing isn\u2019t the best tbh but once u get into the story you stop paying attention to it.\n\nThe cinematography &amp; photography is also excepcional. Top tier quality imo. \n\nIn short, if u liked Youth Of Man or Taxi Driver (2017 movie) and u want a drama with a similar vibe, Oasis is waiting for you.",

It'll be interesting to see where the story goes, it's too early to tell if I'll stick with it yet.\n\nAlso, Choo Young Woo's teeth are giving me snow blindness and Jang Dong-yoon's fake tan is almost as distracting as his janky hairstyles, they're really doing the boy dirty in this one lol.",

I\u2019m liking the plot so far, the characters are interesting and complex.\n\nAt the moment, the only characters I like are Doo Hak, Jung Jin and Doo Hak\u2019s mother. Doo Hak\u2019s father seems to very stuck in his past as a servant and his feelings of obligation to this family. I know a lot of his actions are attributed to that, but for the life of me I cannot wrap my head around him &gt;! telling his own child to drop out of school, and then later take the blame for a murder he didn\u2019t commit, !&lt; just for the sake of this Choi Cheol\u2019s family. His father &gt;! ended up being ruined anyway, so a fat lot of good that did !&lt;. And Choi Cheol pisses me off majorly with how flippant he acted &gt;! when he saw Doo Hak out of prison, like he had done nothing wrong. Doo Hak lost five years of his life bc of him, and there\u2019s not even a sliver of apology. I\u2019m sure his being a leader of the rebellion is some sort of penance for his father\u2019s death and Doo Hak taking the blame, !&lt; but atp his character is still annoying to me.",

The plot of the first 2 episodes was kind of predictable (I mean obviously, since it was covered in the promo material for this show) but capably handled. I like the cast so far and I\u2019m interested in the time period.\n\nMy one hesitation at this point is that the trailers and posters mostly leaned SO heavily on the teenager stuff (until the final poster, iirc?)  that now that we\u2019ve ended up covering all those scenes with 14 episodes left I\u2019m kinda like ok\u2026.where do we go from here?? I\u2019m excited to find out though!",

Oddly, all the Ajummas are styled very well.  Had they as styled her to fit the time period, her beauty would've shown more brightly instead her sticking out like a character from another drama.  Both ML acting is good.  I'd like to see more emotion from the FL.  For example, the chasing after the police car and prison bus scenes,  where were the tears???  The mother did a stellar job, but the FL performance was bland.  The scenes could have been more impact ful and memorable.  My conclusion, she didn't like him that much, bc if it was me I'd be bawling my eyes out.  She was allowed to stand wayyyy too long at the police car, and we got nothing from that scene.",

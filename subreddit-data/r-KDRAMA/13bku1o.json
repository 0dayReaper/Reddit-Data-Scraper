How they managed to get **Lie After Lie**, **Show Window: The Queen's House**, and now QoM is just *skills* and good taste.\n\nI'm so invested in Jae Yi's journey -- partly because Kim Sun Ah is absolutely stunning in the role but mostly because it's such an emotional journey. Jae Yi's breakdowns are suffocating to watch and that makes them feel that much more real.\n\nAt this point, I don't know if I want revenge more or healing more as the end goal.",

There's a moment in Woman of Dignity where she says to Ah Jin that they can still be friends.  Ah Jin replies \"we were never friends\" and in a seconds-long shot of KSA you see her dry eyes begin to tear up and her facial expression go from hurt to recovery.  She's amazing and this role is perfect for her.\n\nThe other shows you mention are going on my To Be Watched list.\n\nI was stunned when&gt;! she was told she had proof they'd had sex but not of the rape.!&lt;  I hadn't thought of that and he was absolutely right.  \n\nAnd her determination when she said she'd take off the mask that he wore every day to hid his true character - that was epic.\n\nI'm really enjoying this and can't wait for each episode.",

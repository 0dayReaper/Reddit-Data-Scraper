Ever compare Lee Ji An (*My Mister*) with Lee Soon Shin (*You Are the Best*)?\n\nEdit: I thought IU's first leading role really showcased her acting potential as she gave a consistent and believable portrayal of an affable, budding actress/idol character (and this was across fifty episodes).  Five years later, she portrayed a character that gave off a completely different vibe.  I wouldn't want to encounter someone like Lee Ji An in real life. IU's acting was key in the transformation of this character.  This differential in how she emotes is what makes it fun to watch (for me).  It's just terribly exciting watching a talented actress tackling more challenging projects, especially if good writing and directing are involved.",

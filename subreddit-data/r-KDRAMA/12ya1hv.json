    "postText": "[Hello](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) and welcome to Kim Tan's Talk Time (Tuesday)! \n\nThis is a free-for-all discussion in which *almost* anything goes, don't diss *The Heirs* or break any of our other core rules. General discussion about anything and everything is allowed. \n\nConsider this post a refuge from all the memes and fanart that are  pouring in and enjoy the peace and quiet. Think of it as Tan's family  wine cellar, [the perfect place to chill out from the world](https://i.imgur.com/ZbVbp0Z.png) in a fabulous sweater and have a little chat.\n\n**Who is this Kim Tan I keep hearing about and why does he have not one, but two threads dedicated to him?** Good questions. If you take a look through our [glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions), you will find all the answers you seek;\n\n&gt;**KIM TAN** is the lead male in [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA)\u2019s favourite drama, [The Heirs](https://mydramalist.com/6640-the-heirs). He\u2019s kind of the worst but he has great sweaters so it balances out. \u201cKim Tan\u201d is used in three ways on [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA); 1) when referring to [Lee Min Ho\u2019s](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) seminal character in *The Heirs*, 2) when referring to Automod (alt. [Tan Bot](https://i.redd.it/qr33zzkhwgg31.gif))   - \u201cKim Tan is feeling very triggered by my post\u201d, \u201cS\\*\\*\\*! Tan Bot just   ate my post\u201d, 3) In place of \u201cGod\u201d or other deities - \u201cFor the love of [Kim Tan](https://i.redd.it/lus5duqssgg31.gif?)!\u201d    \n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or  anything you think should be redacted**.

There\u2019s a scene towards the end where there\u2019s no dialogue just their faces looking at each other and I am BAWLING. I am making myself tear up just thinking about it \ud83d\ude05\n\nOn a lighter note, if anyone is looking for a really fun beach read, I adored **Counterfeit** by Kirstin Chen - it\u2019s about an Chinese American lawyer-turned-stay-at-home-mom and her old Stanford classmate who has morphed from fobby roommate into a glamorous globetrotting business woman. The business turns out to be high end counterfeit handbags\u2026There are so many threads that are woven through - playing with racism/stereotypes, Asian Americans vs Asians, how truly brutal and lonely young motherhood can be, the value of status symbols, how reliable the narrative may or may not be\u2026I was hooked and truly no idea how it would end. Also I remember hearing in the news about high end fakes somehow being sold at stores like Neiman Marcus - to read about how these frauds occurred was eye opening. The kind of book where you accidentally learn something while being truly entertained.",

I understand now why this is one of the most recommended kdramas and I'm glad I checked it off my list :) I also finished **Touch Your Heart** and I'm glad I watched Goblin first because I caught little things I might have missed otherwise, like the leaf in the book.\n\nI'm currently back to watching **Happiness** even though I am not normally into zombie themes. Enjoying it a lot. A reminder to myself that sometimes I need to branch out!",

Fansubbing used to be an interactive community model; now it's an interactive community model that profits a multi-billion dollar company that a) can afford to pay, b) [doesn't have a great relationship with the community](https://www.vulture.com/article/rakuten-viki-volunteer-stories.html) and c) is trying to replace them with a bot it's using them to train (aka, the ['suggested subs'](https://discussions.viki.com/t/machine-translation-from-viki/25227?page=7)).\n\nI absolutely think they (and you) should be paid; not on a salaried model, but as piece work. And not because your hobbies should be monetized, but because you create something of value for a community and should be fairly compensated for it.",

            "comment": "I randomly woke up at 5 am and was dreading potentially losing sleep and ruining my day ahead but I put some ocean waves sounds on and managed to fall back into the most peaceful sleep. The best part of it being that I had the most wonderful dream involving Park Seo Joon, Park Hyungshik, Choi Wooshik, Taehyung and me. Must\u2019ve been totally unrelated to them being at the **Dream** premiere \ud83d\ude02. \n\n\nSo we were at the same house or rather there were a set of 3 guest houses side by side and I was at one of them. I come out onto the patio to have dinner and I see them all returning from the premiere. PHS, Wooshik and Tae are happy to see me and say oh it\u2019s been so long etc etc. They say to me to wait while they wash up and come back to hang out. PSJ can\u2019t seem to make eye contact with me and we just nod our acknowledgment to each other as though we have some history (we do but the dream reveals it a little later). PHS notices but doesn\u2019t say anything. \n\nAnyway we all hang out and are laughing and joking. Then whilst wrapping up Seo Joon steps out of his room and says something like I can\u2019t seem to find something and whilst clearing dishes I say without missing a beat that it\u2019s because xyz happened a few years ago and we lost the thing remember. He looks a bit sad/pensive being reminded, the others look from him to me and realize we have some history which explains why Seo Joon is the way he is and why they haven\u2019t seen me in ages. \n\nWooshik and Tae disappear. Hyungshik goes to his room. Then suddenly Seo Joon\u2019s Mom appears and he seems stressed and I\u2019m upset on his behalf so I make some pointed statements defending him. The mother\u2019s like who is this (about me) and what does she know\u2026Seo Joon just ushers her away. He\u2019s helping me clear things but my t shirt gets dirty and he perks up to say \u201cif you want your old clothes are still in the room\u201d. I go in to grab a t shirt\u2026Hyungshik is there and he finally asks if there\u2019s something on between PSJ and me, and I tell him whatever our past deal was. Whilst I\u2019m telling him the story there\u2019s hints now that PHS is somewhat interested in me too (or was I couldn\u2019t tell) but keeps quiet because he also realizes PSJ and I are meant to be (lololol). \n\nThe next morning PSJ is gone, I can\u2019t reach him (I\u2019ve since made up my mind that we need to resolve the past and be together) and Hyungshik, Wooshik and Tae are surprised about him disappearing too.  They promise me that they won\u2019t let him close himself off again and lose me this time. \n\nThe dream then skips through to when we\u2019re united again and happy together and the mother just has to deal. \n\nTL;DR: I had a dream involving most of Wooga squad. I get into a love triangle with PSJ and PHS, but PHS sacrifices to make sure PSJ and I have a happy ending. \n\nWhen I tell you guys how I didn\u2019t want the dream to end \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude48 such a full blown KDrama! Haha.",

I got teary eyed for the most random character in moonlovers, 10th prince eun. And that's all. Oh, he zique in go ahead also made me teary eyed.\n\nCan anyone relate?",

There\u2019s a generational gap between them, which she was willing to learn and participate, but you can see her being uncomfortable and her blatant refusal to acknowledge the incompatibility. Even for small things like the foods she liked, she wouldn\u2019t admit that she liked them. I don\u2019t think Suho was a particularly terrible person, he was just someone acting his age, which meant he didn\u2019t have the emotional maturity for Hyesung and just general incompatibility. All of this from the writer is to say that Jun is the only guy who Hyesung is her most comfortable and authentic self with, which is why there is a budding romance there.!&lt;",

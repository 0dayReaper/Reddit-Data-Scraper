More younger viewers got to know about KNG and LDH, esp KNG. This group of viewers are not likely to watch the usual KNG dramas as they are mainly non romcom. \n\nWatching this drama is like watching a mime (semi); minimal dialogue with lots of action and non verbal acting. Hahaha.\n\nI like the collaboration between Van and Yohan in this episode. For once they are not fighting each other. \n\nInitially I wanted Island to be a 16 ep drama. But now I think 12 ep would suffice. Time flies during watching as each ep is only 40 mins. Thankfully, they know when to end it instead of just dragging it on for another 4 more episodes.",

Some shots are cringe (&gt;!like a big focus on Yohan's face while Van is fighting the suicide demon, or the weird slow motion when Yohan is trying to save the students in ep3!&lt;).\n\n&gt;!I still don't understand where Yohan's power comes from (what's with the blue eyes?) and how Miho and Van survived that fall when he was hurt. Did he teleport with her? Also, since Miho remembers Wonjeong, why does she still have her own personality? Everyone kept saying she would disappear once her memories came back. !&lt;\n\nMany things are confusing, and I don't know how they will wrap it up in 2 episodes. Thank god for KNG, he is such a good actor. I like LDH too! CEW has also improved a lot in my opinion.",

I suppose Van used his powers but gee, after the dramatic knife in the back and fall off the cliff, there\u2019s no scary falling scene and splash  in the water where they could have used that deep tank of water all the dramas use.

Tho I feel like granny should be able to feel when Gungtan awakens from her supernatural senses but I'm giving benefit of doubt and pretending his energy wasn't as malicious then or strong that she could feel it.!&lt;\n\nI somewhat appreciate the &gt;!death of Su Ryeon as a character,!&lt; because I think it is necessary as the starting sign&gt;! of Yeom Ji's turning away from her uncle/Gungtan's side. Initially she still sided with him due to her long and familiar relationship with him. Besides Gungtan's nature being really wicked and evil, though a huge reason to part from him, she had no other reason to leave him especially because of how she met him. She probably regarded him as her saviour or the person who marked the beginning of her freedom from her father and hence holds some loyalty to him. But due to Su Ryeon's death, Yeom Ji is forced to acknowledge and hence \\*finally\\* able to recognise this evil nature of Gungtan, as now his actions has affected something personal to her she can't ignore. After her death, we get to see hints of Yeom Ji finally questioning her alliance with Gungtan (his threatening again someone dear to her the grandma, and him killing the mother of the baby she ran away with). I'm looking forward to when she finally chooses to stand against him. Expecting that she will do something that will play a card to turn the tables against him! !&lt;",

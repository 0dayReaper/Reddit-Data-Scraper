Both had significant traumatic issues, but I wound up liking them because of the acting and the overall story. I admit there was an episode in each where I was unsure if I should stick with them or not, but I'm very glad I did. \n\nIf you want something fun with great acting and scenery, check out *Racket Boys*. It was a pleasant surprise and is now in my all time Top 10. Think I might give it a rewatch soon! Fair warning: it does have its dark moments (suicide mentioned in flashback) so if that is a trigger, avoid it. Ultimately even the darkest moments of the main characters end up being handled sensitively, for which I was grateful.",

Not taking away from Oh Yeong-su\u2019s performance, which was brilliant, just that I feel there are other series (even Mouse!) that are more novel.",

An elaborate game where you fight to the death for money is pretty far from real life (yes, I know it can be interpreted as a metaphor, but you know what I mean ha). The Hunger Games, Lord of the Flies, Battle Royale etc have shown that survival games are compelling and popular formula. \n* Marketing, pt 1: \"Squid Game\" the name itself is very intriguing and memorable. This name, plus the striking visuals (the guards, the giant doll, the room with all the doors and staircases), make it stick out in people's minds. To compare a show with a similar premise, I personally enjoyed Alice in Borderland more but I don't think the name has the same intrigue as Squid Game. \n* Marketing, pt 2: I have absolutely no insider knowledge about how Netflix algorithms work, but since this was a Netflix original, they absolutely knew it had the potential to be big and I'm sure promoted it accordingly. Squid Game showed up on my home screen as the promoted show as soon as it premiered. \n* We also can't forget the power of word of mouth/social media trends.",

And even a series like Beyond Evil, which IS on Netflix, isn't going to get the same promotion as a Netflix original. Understandably, they're going to prioritize their own series. \n\nEven so, as amazing as Red Sleeve is (my favorite 2021 drama by far), I don't know if I see it hitting big with international audiences even if it was on Netflix. If you've never watched a kdrama before, I'm sure you're more inclined to pick up something that sounds shocking and intriguing like Squid Game, rather than a historical drama. But maybe I'm wrong!",

Which means they'll be in the system for real.\n\n* The kids are taken by the orphanage arm of the operation, reported as missing.\n\n* Then the parents adopt another kid.\n\n* Having a baby and then adopting another kid must add a lot of points to win the lottery, which could take years. \n\n* Left unsaid is what happens to kids when they get older.\n\n* I don't understand how the loan part works either.\n\nI know there was a lot of exposition as per usual in the show, but I can't wrap my brain around this cruelty. I know it's fake, but damn did it make my blood boil. Really needed the Kang Pil Sung to get beaten up a bit more.\n\nAs for the reveal at the end and a preview: &gt;!I'm guessing the guy watching from the car in the previous episode was just our mole's henchman, a moleman if you will. I don't think he's necessarily the bad guy, only that our crew ran into his operations and he's curious about them. He could've taken them all out by now, he doesn't even know what they do yet.!&lt;\n\nAlso, how dare they divorce without giving us some genuine awkward moments. This ship needs some more gas in the tank!",

There\u2019s extra advantages for married couples, families with kids, public servants etc. \n\nThey\u2019re adapting kids to get an advantage in the lottery and abandon them when they win.  \n\nIn different Drama Happiness. ML and FL got fake marriage in addition to public service to win the home ownership.  Similar situation there, but it came with zombie problem.\n\nSo Kang Pil Sung got those desperate with home ownership. Set them up with fake kids and offered loans to them.  Then they win the ownership of home with fake kid.  He then forces them to pay up the loan.  And since they can\u2019t, he\u2019ll take their newly purchased home and also take the kids to find a new couple to adapt them so he can get another home same way. \n\nMarried couple can\u2019t sue or call police since they\u2019re breaking the law and KPS has all the evidence to toss them into the jail. And they\u2019ll still owe the money. \n\nEdit : forgot to add Kang Pil Sung part",

The new guy might not even be the sniper, but a member of some national mafia or some sort. Besides, the cases handled last season were not of national importance yet, and perhaps bigger dogs would now be more involved.",

But, that doesn't explain the lack of Hana.",

Most of the viewers saw the young guy as being suspicious and lo and behold he truly is. I would have preferred a twist or to be left guessing until closer to the end and then it be made known that he was a red herring and truly a goid kid with some special ability (smarts, black belt in tons of martial arts, etc.). Surprising that Go Eun didn't complete a background check on the background check to double verify that the new kid is clean...... Feels like a major plot hole. That and the team carelessly leaving the key to the hideout visible and easy to access",

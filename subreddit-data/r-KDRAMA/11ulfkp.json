    "postText": "**[Index](https://imgur.com/pmsICIb):** Introduction; **A.** Ep. 1: Mago, water ghost, Grim Reaper; **B.** Korean beliefs about the afterlife; **C.** Ep. 2: Sanzu River and the bridge; Baekdu Tiger; **D.** Ep. 5: \u201cGhost wedding\u201d and \u201cghost bride\u201d; **E.** Ep. 7: Molka (spy camera)\n\n**Introduction** (knowing the historical and cultural backgrounders of K-dramas wiil make us international viewers understand and appreciate K-dramas more)\n\nIn my [comprehensive analysis of the gorgeous cinematography of \u201cHotel Del Luna,\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/oc9al2/hotel_del_luna_comprehensive_analysis_of_its/) I explained why I hesitated in watching it:\n\n&gt;When I first read that \u201cHotel Del Luna\u201d was about a hotel with ghosts as its guests, I immediately said, \u201cNah, I won\u2019t ever watch such a drama.\u201d But when I found out that it has \u201csageuk\u201d elements, I wavered a bit because I primarily watch historical dramas.\n\nI love digging up the historical and cultural backgrounders of the K-dramas that I watch because they add so much to my understanding of dramas and their story arcs. For example, after finding out about the history of the song \u201cArirang\u201d (Korea's unofficial anthem), I've come to appreciate and understand why it's used in a lot of K-dramas, whether historical or modern. For example, in \u201cCrash Landing on You,\u201d the song [\u201cPictures of My Heart\u201d](https://youtube.com/watch?v=97fcDQ7FZoE&amp;t=16m8s) repeats the word \u201cArirang\u201d several times in the refrain. You might also remember that scene in Ep. 4 of CLOY where Se-ri and Capt. Ri Jyeong-hyuk's men played words games that featured differences between South Korean and North Korean words; near the end of that scene, you can hear in the background a piano and  cello duet of a modern version of \u201cArirang\u201d (which signifies their unity despite their differences) \n\nSpeaking of \u201cArirang,\u201d you might be interested in the YT video of a young Korean woman playing \u201cArirang\u201d on a piano in the UK. A famous YouTuber hears her and thinks that she's playing the gospel hymn \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d [Their piano duet of \u201cArirang\u201d and \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d starting at the 1:17 mark is epic.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=g56zR-Jlz7w)\n\n**Knowing the historical and cultural backgrounders also helps me appreciate other K-dramas:**\n\n**(1)** [In Ep. 1 of \u201cMr. Sunshine,\u201d you'll see at the end of the battle over Ganghwa Island between the Joseon defenders and the American navy, the flag of the Joseon commanding general falls. That general's flag is called \u201cSujagi.\u201d](https://imgur.com/8ag7Fd0) (In history, that flag was captured as a war trophy in 1871 and displayed in the US Naval Academy Museum until 2007.) In Ep. 2, Season 2 of \u201cKingdom,\u201d &gt;!Lord Ahn Hyeon!&lt; becomes a zombie and charges at the soldiers and Lord Cho Hak-ju. [You can see that he has a pole with a flag attached to his back. That flag is a \u201cSujagi\u201d with the Chinese characters for \u201ccommanding general.\u201c](https://imgur.com/sydJpnM)\n\n**(2)** In Ep. 1 of [\u201cMy Name,\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/qjm1ia/my_name_comprehensive_analysis_of_its_compelling/) Ji-woo is tricked by three thugs who claimed her reward money for giving information about who killed &gt;!her father!&lt;. I was watching a YouTube reaction to \u201cMy Name,\u201d and when one of thugs said \"Grim Reaper\" (in the English subs), the YT reactor said that \"Grim Reaper\" must be the code name of the killer. **I nearly fell out of my seat laughing!**\n\n**What surprised me as I dug up the cultural backgrounders of \u201cHotel Del Luna\u201d is that the Hong sisters seem to have used not only elements of Korean culture and mythology but also elements from Japanese and Chinese cultures and mythologies.** Examples: The \u201cSanzu River\u201d and the bridge seem to have come from Japanese Buddhist tradition, while \u201cghost bride\u201d and \u201cghost wedding\u201d seem to have come from Chinese culture.\n\nIn digging up the historical and cultural backgrounders of the K-dramas that I watch, I rely on English language resources on the Internet. I don't speak or read Korean, and so I can't search through Naver or rely on Google Translate. **Thus, those of you who read Korean or are more knowledgeable about Korean culture and history should correct whatever errors or omissions there may be in this discussion.**\n\n**A.** In Ep. 1, the drama introduces to us the recurring characters of [Mago](https://imgur.com/N3jCji7) and the Grim Reaper. Another character that's featured in Ep. 1 is the water ghost.\n\nIn ancient Korean creation myths, \u201cMago\u201d is the creator goddess. (It\u2019s \u201cMagu\u201d in Chinese and \u201cMako\u201d in Japanese.)\n\nOther mythological figures:\n\n- Joseung Saja: Grim Reaper\n- Mul gwishin: water ghost\n- Kaekkwi: a wandering ghost\n- Dokkaebi: goblin\n- Cheonyeo gwishin: virgin ghost\n\nFrom **\u201cKorean folklore characters: The Joseung Saja/Grim Reapers\u201d** (Amino Apps):\n\n&gt;Korea is famous for having hundreds of traditional stories and superstitions especially towards the paranormal. Korean ghost movies are famous and too many to count. Drama often include ghosts. And with ghosts come a very important figure of legend. The Grim Reaper. Nearly every religion and country has it\u2019s own form of the grim reaper all varying in looks and outlook towards them some positive some not.\n&gt;\n&gt;In Korea the Grim Reaper is known as Joseung Saja which has many meanings as Lion or Herald or Messenger but simply means Reaper. The difference with this Grim Reaper is in appearance and his role. Many cultures view Grim reapers as evil or even the ones killing people. Korean Reapers are known as something called a Psychopomp which are creatures, deities or beings who\u2019s job is to guide newly deceased souls to the afterlife. Their role is not to judge or kill a soul but simply to guide them.\n\n**B. Korean beliefs about the afterlife**\n\nFrom [\u201cThe end of a life: Concepts of afterlife\u201d](http://m.jejuweekly.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=1374) (Jeju Weekly): \n\n&gt;Beliefs about afterlife can\u2019t be entirely conceived according to one\u2019s cultural matrix, as differing religious belief systems play a great role. However, in Jeju, as in mainland Korea, there is a remarkable religious syncretism, as evidenced by some overlapping of Shamanism, Buddhism, Confucianism and even Christianity.\n&gt;\n&gt;A Shamanic tradition commonly called Mu (often termed \u201cMusok\u201d by scholars) is widely believed to be the original religious system of both the Korean peninsula and Jeju, though it takes a different form in each. The worship of Sanshin, mountain spirits, may precede even Mu, according to Professor David Mason of Kyunghee University, though this remains unconfirmed.\n\nFrom [\u201cSpirituality and the Afterlife in Korea: A brief overview of spiritual customs in historic Korea\u201d](https://www.tota.world/article/156/)\n\n&gt;Korea\u2019s religious history is one of change and cooperation. Faiths like Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Christianity have all left their mark on the nation. None have enjoyed the influence and longevity of Korean shamanism, or Muism. Noted in villages from ancient times, Muism gave and took from each religion it encountered. It survived every Korean dynasty for 4,000 years or more and is still practiced by millions today.\n&gt;\n&gt;Muism views the Earth as a fountain of life energy. Human beings are part of that energy and must move with it to find peace. Those who struggle against this natural harmony become vulnerable to harmful spirits. In some kut, Mudang deal more with emotional health than spiritual. Participants may be encouraged to laugh, cry, and act out in ways they normally cannot. In Joseon Korea, this included masked plays poking fun at the yangban. Other ceremonies were more direct, making offerings to spirits and warding them away.\n\n**C. Ep. 2: Sanzu River and the bridge; Baekdu Tiger**\n\n**[Sanzu River and the bridge](https://imgur.com/NIysybW)**\n\nFrom [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanzu_River): \n&gt;The Sanzu-no-Kawa (lit. \u201cRiver of Three Crossings\u201d, or the \u201cSanzu River\u201d) is a mythological river in Japanese Buddhist tradition similar to the Hindu concept of the Vaitarna and Greek concept of the Styx.\n&gt;\n&gt;Before reaching the afterlife, the souls of the deceased must cross the river by one of three crossing points: a bridge, a ford, or a stretch of deep, snake-infested waters. The weight of one\u2019s offenses while alive determines which path an individual must take. It is believed that a toll of six mon must be paid before a soul can cross the river, a belief reflected in Japanese funerals when the necessary fee is placed in the casket with the dead.\n&gt;\n&gt;The Sanzu River is popularly believed to be in Mount Osore, a suitably desolate and remote part of Aomori Prefecture in northern Japan. \n\n**Baekdu Mountain and the Baekdu Tigers**\n\n**(1) [Baekdu or Paekdu mountain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paektu_Mountain)**\n\n&gt;Paektu Mountain also known as Baekdu Mountain and in China as Changbai Mountain, is an active stratovolcano on the Chinese\u2013North Korean border. At 2,744 m (9,003 ft), it is the highest mountain of the Changbai and Baekdudaegan ranges. Koreans assign a mythical quality to the volcano and its caldera lake, considering it to be their country\u2019s spiritual home. It is the highest mountain in Korea and Northeast China.\n\n**[Baekdu Tiger](https://imgur.com/E55Ivbj)**\n\nFrom [\u201cAfter nearly a century, Korean tigers back to Baekdudaegan mountain range\u201d](http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/780483.html):\n\n&gt;Korean tigers have returned to the Baekdu-daegan mountain range for the first time in nearly a century.\n&gt;\nThe Korea Forest Service announced on Jan. 26 that it had transported a pair of male Korean tigers named Duman, 15, and Geumgang, 11, the day before to the tiger forest at the Baekdu-daegan National Arboretum in Seobyeok, a village in the Chuyang township of Bonghwa County, North Gyeongsang Province. Both tigers are named after Korean rivers.\n&gt;\n&gt;Also known as \u201cMt. Baekdu tigers,\u201d the Korean tigers are returning to the Baekdudaegan range on the southern Korean Peninsula for the first time since the last known example was captured at Gyeongju in 1921.\n&gt;\n&gt;The pair of tigers was donated by China in 2011 through a bilateral forestry cooperation meeting.\n\nRelated resource: [\u201cSiberian tiger Geumgang dies after move to mountains\u201d](https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=223495)\n\n**D.** [**Ep. 5: \u201cGhost wedding\u201d and \u201cghost bride\u201d**](https://imgur.com/3uRnyqY)\n\nFrom [\u201cGhost marriages: A 3,000-year-old tradition of wedding the dead is still thriving in rural China\u201d](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-07/ghost-marriages-in-rural-china-continue-to-thrive/9608624)\n(ABC AU):\n\n&gt;Often labelled \u201cbare branches\u201d and \u201cleftover women\u201d, Chinese bachelors and bachelorettes face immense societal pressure to get married and have children, partly because parents play an central role in their children\u2019s spouse selection.\n&gt;\n&gt;But in some parts of China, some parents are even going as far as to perform \u201cghost marriages\u201d \u2014 that is, a marriage for two deceased people to live in the netherworld together, according to the 3,000-year-old belief.\n\nFrom [\u201cWedding a Taiwanese ghost in a Korean dress\u201d](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2017/07/06/2003673981) (Taipei Times):\n\n&gt;When Maria Yoon learned that three men in China had killed two mentally disabled women to sell as brides, she was all the more determined to get married again. It would be her 53rd time doing so.\n&gt;\n&gt;In Taiwan, if an unmarried woman passes away, her family may place red packets with cash, paper money, a lock of hair, a fingernail out in the open and wait for a man to pick them up. The first man to pick up the packets is chosen as the groom and it is believed to be bad luck if he refuses to marry the ghost bride.\n\nNote: The paragraph immediately above is depicted in similar details in Ep. 5.\n\nFrom [\u201cChina\u2019s ghost weddings and why they can be deadly\u201d](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-37103447) (BBC):\n\n&gt;Police in north-west China have charged a man with murdering two women with mental disabilities, alleging that he wanted to sell their corpses to be used in so-called \u201cghost weddings\u201d.\n&gt;\n&gt;It has put a spotlight on the ancient shadowy ritual, still practised in certain parts of China, which aims to provide spouses for people who die unmarried.\n&gt;\n&gt;What is a ghost wedding?\n&gt;\n&gt;Believers in the custom, practised for some 3,000 years, say it ensures the unmarried dead are not alone in the afterlife.\n&gt;\n&gt;Originally, the weddings were strictly for the dead - a ritual conducted by the living to wed two single deceased people - but in recent times some have involved one living person being married to a corpse.\n\nRelated resource: [Maria the Korean Bride: Ghost Wedding Trailer](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yGtI10kp9Gw)  (YouTube)\n\n**E. Ep. 7: \u201cMolka\u201d (term for hidden spy cameras or to images and videos from these cameras)**\n\n[The vengeful ghost who escaped from Room 13 in Ep. 5 is revealed in Ep. 7](https://imgur.com/1RFsrtA) as &gt;!a college student who killed herself after she was victimized by a video from a spy camera hidden in her room!&lt;.\n\nFrom [\u201cSouth Korea\u2019s spy camera epidemic has women fearful they are watched wherever they go\u201d](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-17/spy-cam-sex-crimes-in-south-korea-leave-women-fearful/100214532) (ABC):\n\n&gt;A new report from Human Rights Watch (HRW) has found the widespread posting of sexual images of women and girls in South Korea is having a \u201cdevastating impact on the victims.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;The problem is so widespread in South Korea, it even has a name: molka, which means hidden camera.\n&gt;\n&gt;Women are covertly recorded and the footage is then uploaded to websites visited by men who often pay subscription fees to access them. \n\nFrom [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molka):\n\n&gt;In South Korea, molka are miniature cameras secretly and illegally installed in order to capture voyeuristic images and videos. However, the crime of molka refers to images taken with any kind of camera or smartphone. The voyeuristic images and videos are sold online across various platforms, including popular social media sites like Twitter and Tumblr, without knowledge or consent of those on camera. \u201cMolka\u201d can refer to both the actual cameras as well as the footage later posted online. South Korea\u2019s highly digitized society makes it easy to circulate molka footage and difficult to remove it once circulated.\n&gt;\n&gt;The rate of arrests of hidden camera crimes has increased since 2011, and such crimes have become a prominent point of feminist protest and #MeToo in South Korea. Women make up the overwhelming majority of victims of hidden camera crimes, while men make up the vast majority of perpetrators. Some critics allege that molka crimes and the lack of action taken towards them are a product of distorted gendered violence against women in South Korea and the flaws in the law enforcement system.\n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cMy life is not your porn\u201d became a slogan popularized in the protest as a response to the prevalence of spy cameras installed in everyday places.\n\nNote: In Ep. 5 of [\u201cA Business Proposal,\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/ui8ozf/a_business_proposal_comprehensive_analysis_of_its/) Young-seo discovers the spy camera that was planted by &gt;!her neighbor in the table lamp!&lt;. In Ep. 6, she becomes traumatized about using &gt;!public bathrooms!&lt;. In the Ep. 5 scene where Sung-hoon comes to help her, you can hear her say the word \u201cmolka.\u201d \n\n**Notes:**\n\n**1.** As I stated in the Introduction, I rely on English language resources on the Internet in digging up the historical and cultural backgrounders of the K-dramas that I watch. I don't speak or read Korean, and so I can't search through Naver.

The movie depicts the rivalry between the tradition-bound Royal Tailor and the avantgarde designer.\n\nTo give you an idea of the fabulous dresses worn by the Queen (Park Shin-hye) as designed by the avantgarde designer (Go Soo) and by the Royal Noble Concubine as designed by the Royal Tailor, watch https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aOxy0CT40oQ (at the 3:42 mark, the Queen makes her grand entrance into the royal banquet with her breathtaking ceremonial dress). But this scene is a bit spoilery; if you become interested in this movie, just watch the clip up to the 3:33 mark.\n\nMost websites and blogs that have reviewed this movie say that the movie's ending leaves a bad taste in the mouth. But I have posted in another forum a different interpretation of the ending that gives the avantgarde designer the justice that he deserves and the Royal Tailor his full redemption.",

Many elements of East Asian folklore repeat, with minor variations, across different nations. For example, the Korean *gumiho* and the Japanese *kitsune* are clearly related.\n\nReally interesting post. Thanks for taking the time to write all this up.",

Disgraceful actually!\n\n**A blockbuster drama that's set similarly to \"Mr. Sunshine\" is the 2012 \"Bridal Mask\" aka \"Gaksital\"** (starring Joo Won and Jin Se-yeon). The drama follows a man named Lee Kang-to, a Korean police officer commissioned by the Japanese Police to betray his own country. It won \u201cDrama of the Year\u201d in the 13th Republic of Korea National Assembly Awards. Trailer at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AI-g1EXuK_c\n\n**You might also be interested in the 2016 K-historical movie \"Love, Lies\" that's also set during the Japanese colonial period in Korea.** The film was directed by Park Heung-sik, reuniting \u201cThe Beauty Inside\u201d co-stars Han Hyo-joo, Chun Woo-hee, and Yoo Yeon-seok (\"Dong-mae\" in \"Mr. Sunshine\"). The twist at the end of the movie will make you cry for the next three months. Ha ha. Trailer of \"Love, Lies\" at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vAHhmKMmaMw\n\n**The first time I came across the word \"Joseon\" was when I watched the 2013 blockbuster drama \"My Love From The Star\" starring Jun Ji-hyun and Kim Soo-hyun.** That piqued my interest in learning more about the Joseon Dynasty. (Although I had seen some scenes of \"A Jewel in the Palace,\" \"My Love From the Star\" was the first K-drama I watched in full.) MV of \"My Love From The Star\" at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D07Q2k04uCU\n\n**P.S.**\n\n**Another K-drama that's set during the Japanese colonial period is \"Jejoongwon.\"** It's a historical-medical drama that depicts a fictionalized account of Jejoongwon, the first Korean hospital of Western medicine founded by American (Presbyterian) medical missionaries and their Korean students. Jejoongwon is now the ultra-modern Severance Hospital, which is part of Yonsei University, one of the top three universities in Korea. These top universities are collectively called \"SKY\" (Seoul National University, Korea University,  and Yonsei University).\n\nYou can read more about \"Jejoongwon\" in my discussion at https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/hm5qck/historical_backgrounders_for_those_who_have_not/\n\n&gt;Immersing myself in food, culture, history and learning Korean. H*ll even got into Kpop!\n\nPlease give Band-Maid, an all-female Japanese band, a chance to win you over with their unique blend of rock (hard, punk, progressive), pop, jazz, and blues. Listen for example to \"Wonderland\" at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x4hxLeHbqZo or \"Domination\" at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QbyQCJn6rYg",

As for the Japanese trap designer, is it truly preferable to die a long slow death stuck in there than a quick bullet to the head? Guess it kept the key away from the  owner as a punishment, but wow - dedication to being spiteful.!&lt;\n\nWondering how the trap rooms&gt;! get rid of dead bodies automatically - after all, 30 thieves had tried it before and none of them were in there and Kim Young Soo said that if they had died their bodies would be dumped there in front of that door where he was waiting.!&lt;\n\nWondering about &gt;!the relationship between the conman and Min Woo.!&lt;",

Also everytime thieves go in does he just hang around and wait for them lol. !&lt;\n\n3rd point - I thought it was heavily implied that &gt;! he's her father. In the scene when she was dropped off to the church as a child, the nun mentions that it is someone who cherishes her very much. !&lt;",

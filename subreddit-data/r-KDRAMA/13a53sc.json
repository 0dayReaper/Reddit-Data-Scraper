I finished **Still 17** last night and I will miss it.\n\nI don\u2019t see this drama recommended much and it\u2019s probably because there\u2019s not a lot of plot to it.  But even so, it has shot to the top of my list alongside **Because This is My First Life** and **Just Between Lovers**.  \n\nLike those two other shows, Still 17 is a series for people looking to watch characters heal and find personal growth while falling in love. Writing, acting and music all work together to provide the viewer with a heartwarming and cathartic journey.  \n\nI don\u2019t usually rewatch shows but this one will be an exception.",

            "comment": "Jeon Do Yeon was pretty good as the feisty ahjumma love interest in Crash Course in Romance and quite glamorous as the alpha assassin in Kill Bok Soon. So it's interesting to see her in Shoot for the Stars, a 2002 drama that's quite poignant especially with the soundtrack featuring Dust in the Wind by Kansas. That plaintive song immediately transports you back in time.\n\nIn this drama, Jeon Do Yeon is young and lovely; she portrays Han So Ra who at 30 is idle and sits around waiting for her oppa to marry her. So Ra is largely bad tempered, lazy and a complainer. I guess JDY is an excellent actress because her belligerent screechy voice and sense of entitlement makes you want to give her a swift kick to the backside. \n\nBut don't be too put off by the beginning episodes, because a huge perk of this drama is getting to see Jo In Sung. \n\nHe has one of those faces that makes you want to puzzle out just how and why he is so handsome. Whenever So Ra begins ranting, I just mute her and gaze at JIS who plays Sung Tae, a young man who's searching for his family and wants to become a major star. Sung Tae is dyslexic and illiterate but can memorize anything after he hears it once. \n\nI'm only at episode 4 so I know there are major growth and redemption arcs ahead. I hope this show continues to hold my interest since Good Bad Mother doesn't air until this Wednesday. Watching early Hallyu content can be a fascinating exercise in studying the aesthetics not to mention the crazy hair styles, and once in a while there are gems and I'm hoping this will be one of those.",

Is it just me, or is the amount of swearing and the fairly explicit sex scene with &gt;!Park Yeon-jin and Jeon Jae-joon!&lt; out of the ordinary for a K-drama? At one point I'm certain that a character said \"\ub300\ubc15\" (daebag) but it was translated on screen as \"f**k me!\"  I feel like it's being Americanized and I don't like it. One of the things that I have enjoyed about K-dramas is that I can watch them to relax and not deal with too much explicit or graphic stuff, especially because I watch these with the family. I knew the bullying scenes would be rough, but I wasn't expecting the rest of this. Is this because it's on Netflix and not on Viki? Are the Viki translators censoring, or is Netflix adding cursing that's not there?\n\n\nEdit added 7 May, after reading discussion of censorship and creative freedom in the comments. I just want to be clear, it's not that I don't think that people should not be allowed to make movies and television shows with explicit or graphic scenes. Sometimes it does contribute to the narrative. I just want to make sure that I know what I am getting into. And in this case, with the swear words added,  there was an altering of the initial creation in order to make it more 'shocking'and therefore more interesting to American viewers on American Netflix. \n\nI already knew from the content description that I was not interested in \"Squid Game.\" This however was a bit different. I was expecting that the bullying scenes would be difficult; and when they were fairly graphic, although it was not the type of content that I usually go for, I can see how it contributes to the narrative and the character's motivation. It was the sex scene in the swearing that feel gratuitous and I was surprised. I guess maybe I'm coming from a concern that the more light Korean dramas that I have enjoyed thus far are going to be turned into another version of American television and that some of the things that I enjoyed are being removed.",

Even the web dramas that are licensed to Viki have more foul language in comparison to dramas broadcast on the stations.\n\n**The Glory** is a web drama (Netflix Original Production). If you have Viki and its available in your region, you can try watching **Alice, the Final Weapon** for comparison to see a similar level of violence, blood, swearing, and explicit scenes as that's also a web drama (Watcha Original).\n\nAs for subtitle translation/accuracy, it's been noted by many users over the years that Netflix subtitles will often be far more liberal in using curse words/swearing than is merited by what is actually being said in Korean. So if you are watching on Netflix and the drama was originally broadcast on a television station in Korea (eg. KBS, MBS, SBS, tvN, jtbc, etc.) and seeing loads of curse words in the subtitles, it may very well be the case that they are adding in cursing that's not there originally in the Korean dialogue.",

The only way I've found if I want to be careful about what I am watching or if I question if the drama will be appropriate or something I want to watch (I really hate gore and violence in general), I ask on here or look on Kdrama recommends first for spoilers. That was very helpful for me to determine if I would watch Squid Game or The Glory. After asking some questions, I realized both were too gory or violent for me.",

I personally welcome it as I feel like I enjoy more mature themes as I get older.\n\nI think a lot of kdrama viewers don't know the difference between kdramas that air on local South Korean TV channels which Netflix buys rights to air...VERSUS kdramas that are exclusively made by Netflix a.k.a. Netflix Originals like The Glory, but now you know! \ud83d\ude04\n\nRegarding subtitles, it's true Netflix tries to make it more suitable for those unfamiliar with Korean language/culture, so Viki would have the more local translations which provides more helpful context.",

TV dramas have been traditionally less explicit not because they are not 'international' but because broadcasting regulations (laws) forbid them to be. And even then depending on the state of the regulations and the time slot of the show, some are very much not family friendly. Especially in earlier years when cable channels like OCN had more wiggle room, their dramas were explicit too.\n\nNetflix Original productions are web dramas and thus are not regulated by broadcasting regulations and *therefore* can be explicit as it wants because of the lack of regulations and laws governing its content. Really has nothing to do with how 'international' Netflix is.\n\nDomestic streaming services have also taken advantage of not being confined by broadcasting regulations in their web dramas despite being Korean streaming services.\n\nAdditionally, Korean films have a long history too and those rated R or above have never shied away from violence and explicitness either -- again because they are not subject to broadcasting regulations.",

Is such content pivotal to the central plot? To those who actually fast forwarded those parts, do you think it made any difference in the flow of the drama or next storyline?\n\nLike some people prefer explicit mature content, some don't. There is nothing being ready. It's not something revolutionary lol.

Not all dramas need to be so implicit.\n\nTo conclude, I'm trying to say that sometimes we should just respect that producers and writers can write/produce the way they want within the legal environment, and even if the audience finds certain things being an issue, they can go ahead and criticize a piece of work, but I don't really support the idea of actively seeking to ban or regulate certain things on screen for the sake of limiting a writer/producer's freedom to create a pieces of work. This is the root of why I won't be like \"oh this Netflix drama has these kinds of scenes so I can't watch it with my family and I don't have any other dramas to watch\", or \"oh I can't enjoy kdramas anymore because it doesn't feel the same as 10 years ago and Netflix has ruined my enjoyment of kdramas\".",

There is nothing interesting about it. There are special sites that live from showing mating. Those who want to watch it can go there. The visual stimulation is anyway nothing compared to the real thing, with pheromones and touch and feelings mixed into it.\n\nSame with violence. Blood. Wounds.\n\nWe don't need to get desensitised to neither mating nor violence. \n\nHumans have hidden ovulation, and this has most likely been very important for our self-domestication. Hidden ovulation means that the woman can choose her mate instead of having to accept the strongest male. Our shyness about sex has almost certainly very deep roots.",

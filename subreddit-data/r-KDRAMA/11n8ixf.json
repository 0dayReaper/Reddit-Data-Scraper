I'm also hoping for some more amazing OSTs.\n\nExcited to see what's going to happen to Doldam hospital and hoping to see some characters from S1 and S2 appear in S3.\n\nI can't wait to see Jin Kyung as Oh Myung-sim too given her nurse role is just very memorable after all these years haha.\n\nIt does make me feel old or like a veteran kdrama watcher given it's really been 3 years since Season 2 aired.",

The doctors' stories were more compelling, the romance arc was much more believable, and I loved that they weren't afraid to make the ML an absolute jackass at the beginning of the story. Too many kdramas suffer from not wanting to give MLs any real flaws.",

I really hope they YYS and SHJ make a cameo or better yet come back for 1-2 episodes. Totally agree about the jackass part, I really didn't like his character in the beginning at all...but I love how he grew throughout the drama. His character in dr romantic and hospital playlist made me really like him, which is surprising cause I absolutely hated him in reply94.",

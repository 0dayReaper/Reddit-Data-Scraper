    "postText": "Welcome to our **Spotlight On** post series where you can share your picks of dramas that deserve the spotlight! Each **Spotlight On** post is focused on a genre or theme, as you can see in the post title. Based on this genre/theme, you are welcome to share your views about dramas you have watched that fit the topic of this post, which is:\n\n**Art/Literary**\n\nDramas that are set in the art / literary world or feature the arts / literature in some way - this may be in the form of books, poetry, art works there may be nice quotations or perhaps the characters work in a field that leads to this focus.\n\nYou are invited to share short (or long) reviews of dramas you have watched that fit the topic of this post and an explanation of why you think the drama deserves the spotlight, including whether you would recommend the drama or not.\n\nOur suggested format/structure for comments is:\n\n**Drama Name**\n\n* **Good Things**: about the drama, \n\n* **Bad Things**: about the drama\n\n* **Interesting Things**: about the drama\n\n* **Spotlight On Because**: explain why you think the drama deserves the spotlight, including whether you would recommend the drama or not.\n\nWe strongly encourage you to share your MDL profile so that others can compare their tastes with yours to get a better understanding of preferences and dislikes, which will help in understanding if the feedback provided is applicable for them.\n\nPlease remember that every individual watching goes in with their own life experiences and biases so not everyone will see the drama in the same light or enjoy it in the same way.\n\n**Just because someone did not enjoy a drama that you loved is not a slight against you as a person.**\n\nWhen participating in this discussion please remember that whilst dramas do not have feelings, human beings do. ***Be kind to one another.***\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or anything you think should be redacted.** If you are using Markdown and not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

            "comment": "**Her Private Life**  \n\n**The Good**: Characters actually are supportive of each other (with a couple of minor exceptions, and those are understandable and quickly resolved), with Ryan Gold (**Kim Jae Wook**) being such a lovely and kind boss. There\u2019s some very nice character development for everyone.  \n\n**The Bad**: There are very few tropes left out.  \n  \n**The Interesting**: The workplace is an art gallery, and glimpses of behind-the-scenes action really are interesting. Pulling together an exhibit and assembling all the moving parts (tracking down and borrowing artworks, liabilities for damaged art, themes, graphics, even designing souvenirs are all touched on) were undoubtedly unrealistic in many ways, but they showed some of the intricacies of creating an exhibit.  \n  \n**The Significant**: The relationships of family and friends are really warm and loving, and I don\u2019t believe the Truck of Doom\u2122\ufe0f made an appearance.",

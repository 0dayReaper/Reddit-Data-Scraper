            "comment": "Why are people acting like revenge dramas are new? They have been a steady k-drama genre for at least the last 20 years. They mention penthouse withou mention Kim Sunok wrote still iconic Temptation of a Wife 15 years ago. Or is this another daily dramas aren't kdramas take? Because there are revenge themes crawling through many daily dramas. Does no one remember Song Joongki's first revenge drama, innocent man? \n\nWhat's changed? There is more money in kdramas now than even 10 years ago. More broadcasting networks, web dramas, netflix, disney +, and more experementation on network television. It's not just the big 3 networks competing against each other. Kdramas are competing against all tv shows made around the world.\n\nAre romance kdramas dead? No. Are light-hearted and fun kdramas dead? No. Some of the biggest hits of the last 5 years fall in these categories: Cloy, woo young woo, hospital playlist, business proposal, etc. And when compared to western dramas, i think the distinction between the two styles is most pronounced, besides comedy shows. And because i would bet most of our first dramas would fall into the easy watch romance category, we hold them in high regard. But make no mistake, kdramas have always been more than the romance genre, and they have slowly been proving that they can bring in the viewers. \n\nAnyway, i think this string of noteworthy revenge shows is just a coincidence. Eve came out last year, and nobody is still talking about it and Pandora is a hot mess, and no one will be talking about it next year. \n\nWhy were the glory, and reborn rich popular? Because they were dramas that entertained people. Why were they made? Some big wig thought they could make money, and they were right. Same as World of the married, cloy, sky castle, misaeng, signal, penthouse, bof, dots, mr. Sunshine, secret garden, hospital playlist, hotel de luna etc. [Insert your favourite drama here] (except your favorite drama might not have high viewership or clout, i know mine doesn't). \n\nI am loving this diversity of kdramas. Gone are the days of my ocn dependance for interesting crime shows, my daily drama crawls for revenge dramas. Im glad i can watch Cloy, and love to hate you, crash couse in romance, woo young woo, 2521 on the same platform i watch move to heaven, beyond evil, inspector koo, misty, and signal. I dont want to go back to the days where i have to worry if the drama i want to watch will get picked up legally, or even if it does, wonder if it will get subbed (actually happened). It's not fun. I love a wide range of kdramas being available, people will be able to find what fits their fancy that way.",

            "comment": "It's definitely unique because as an old kdrama viewer, it's interesting to see the way k-culture and news influenced shows. \n\nIf you go pre-2016, many dramas were very much a \"turn off your brain\" show. Of course, that doesn't mean they aren't relatively good shows, but I wouldn't expect a cheesy show like BOF or Weightlifting Fairy to have a complex story. Most of the kdrama memes we have now, like the Truck or Doom or Subway, come from these shows. Rarely is that type of thing seen nowadays. \n\nHowever, recently there's been a huge shift. From intense stories like D.P, to revenge stories like Weak Hero Class, kdrama producers are using the power of the internet and streaming stories to bypass the restrictions of cable. Even if we stay on the main networks, broadcasters are becoming more and more bold in their story telling. Like I wouldn't imagine Taxi Driver to be an SBS show 5-10 years ago. \n\nFinally, this change also says a lot about the Korean culture. Because of The Glory, there's actually had to be statements put out warning people not to do the things they see in the show. People are vicariously living through these characters, which is disappointing. There's a dark overtone on people's minds, because they can see through recent news reports that the rich and powerful can do it all, while the victims are sidelined. Hell, just recently some people were trying to search through the banks of Itaewon victims to blame them for drug use. Unless things change, I can only see these types of shows grow in popularity as people feel more helpless.",

In Korea not so long ago there was still collective punishment so in other words you make mistake, your family (sometimes very widely meaning) pay as well. Koreans still partially share this sentiment. And it is similar in many cultural aspect which I personally see as cruel but maybe it is just cultural difference.\n\nIn Korean cinema very cruel revenge film were always popular including famous Housemaid (1960). There was revenge trilogy of Park Chan Wook, there was even famous drama trilogy of Kim Ji Woo.As well Korean cinema breakthrough internationally with bloody thrillers. \n\nSo the only thing which change is that streaming let to create more violent drama which were before limited by broadcasting law and general tv audience. K-dramas started to mix with film industry. D.P. or Weak hero are actually project made by film directors. Even Song Kangho is going to have his drama debut and that symbol of this change.Tv dramas also become more violent to not lose with streaming platforms.",

Revenge thrillers have always been a popular genre, but I think general tastes have changed. For the past few years, the top kdramas have been violence related, like The Glory or Squid Game, compared to years past where the biggest shows were rom-coms like Heirs and DOTS (which is funny bc as a military show, it definitely wouldn't be as peaceful if it aired now haha). \n\n&gt;Tv dramas also become more violent to not lose with streaming platforms.\n\nI think that's the key here. I wouldn't say specifically it's a \"Western influence\" but the globalization of kdramas on platforms like Netflix has indirectly changed how the industry sees popularity. There's much more competition now, and people don't even watch that much TV anymore, so you have to do what you can in order to attract their attention.",

I think they tried copy a bit Sora Kara Furu Ichioku no Hoshi, there were even plagiarism controversies but they tried to explain that with Stendhal's Le Rouge et le Noir inspiration. But they weren't bold enough so main female lead was more on neutral side. I think the best Romeo and Juliet was Princess man. There both romance and revenge worked especially that villain- father of main character was very interesting. The golden cross is similar but there romance was less probable. \n\nBut revenge trilogy was focused on revenge firstly, romance didn't play there much role.",

Short duration captures suspense better and I will be done with a heavy concept within 2-3 hrs. \n\nI know it's more satisfying to watch a mentally stimulating drama but watching a silly mindless one is relaxing too. Tbh they provide better escapism. I wholeheartedly hope kdrama won't neglect the silly dramas as it continues to expand its boundaries.

I hope this phase of serious, gritty dramas is just  part of the growing pains that the Korean drama industry will get over with. The most mentally stimulating, semi-realistic TV show that I've ever watched was a Japanese drama about a silly comical lawyer that somehow managed to deliver the most thought-provoking social commentary, without going to dark places. \n\nRecently I tried watching Through the Darkness because people seemed to be unable to stop praising it, but I just can't go past the first episode. It's so not fun to watch, so hopeless, so mundane. I'd rather watch a documentary for that kind of serious, based on real-life events story. \n\nMy favorite Kdrama in recent years is Mr. Queen. It's silly, but it's still mentally stimulating. So many clever and wholesome plot points are introduced, but the show never forgets to have fun while doing it.",

Korean dramas for TV was explicitly geared towards women, as women prefer to stay at home, and that is why they gave female writers a chance to build their own style and learn from each other. Without the gendered approach, we wouldn't have gotten any Hallyu wave. \n\nThe funny thing is that although romance is a category that is often ridiculed, sometimes with good reason (Barbara Cartland for oldies that might read this), men should be happy that many women like it, because basically it is about men and how to get a man. \n\nWhen you divide the shows into categories for Business Proposal and Liberation Notes: Yes, it is clearly a difference in approach to realism. What gets me is when \"realism\" is used for more gritty shows, but not for the rosy stuff that, if you really go through it concept by concept, should be on the same level of realism. It is for example not true that serial murderers are lurking behind every corner, even if these shows often pretend to be realistic.\n\nEDIT: P.S.: Of the last ten shows I saw, On the Verge of Insanity, Dr Parks Clinic, Unlock My Boss and Kairos were all clearly and very much male focused. This is life.\n\nEDIT 2: I understood that you didn't mean that gritty shows always are realistic even if they are called by that word.

Imo what makes Korean shows standout among other Asian contents is their quality. Because every other Asian productions are also producing the same stuff. \r\n\r\nI have always avoided romance and horror like plague, the most I did was read classics from austen and such. Yes I am woman if it isn't apparent already. \r\n\r\nBecause the mentioned genres are too predictable and very rarely have interesting plots (the same old chasing a man/woman and falling in love), not to mention the bad writing style. Kdrama made a huge difference with their storytelling style, complexities and quality. \r\n\r\n&gt;What gets me is when \"realism\" is used for more gritty shows, but not for the rosy stuff that\r\n\r\nI actually prefer it this way. Rosy stuff should stay rosy, murder side plots when nicely done can add bit of thrill but including realistic elements takes away the escapism factor for me. \r\n\r\nI am not bothered by gendered gaze as long as the show is entertaining. I am currently enjoying a male centered romcom the sound of your heart, it's extremely funny. But you can't make me watch squid game or female focused the glory as violence and gore doesn't fall under my definition for entertainment or badly written super cheesy shows like love is sweet. \r\n\r\nWhat I mean to say, individual taste, quality content and exposure are determining factors. Unless someone is a lifeless ah, people nowadays wouldn't label entertainment with genders. I know you mean good, but I would suggest not to waste your energy on such people. They are already too full of themselves to accept your views.",

Honestly, my friends and I have been on an extended K Drama slump since the beginning of the year, there's been nothing really amazing in 2023 for us. Thank goodness for The Glory Part 2.\n\nAlthough there are many Korean dramas that have done very well both locally and internationally, I think only a few can really claim to be **TRUE BIG** international hits. My interpretation of a true big international hit is apart from getting high viewership, reaching #1 Globally, it has also drawn the non-typical K Drama watching viewer - shows like **Squid Game, CLOY, Atty Woo** and now **The Glory**.",

There is only one accurate, publicly accessible measure of a global hit, and that is the Netflix quarterly earning report. Top 10 rankings are an imperfect measure and don't carry weight at HQ, because they care about total hours viewed. There have been many top 10, even top 1 shows that got cancelled (like 1899) because the total hours viewed wasn't enough.\n\nOf the shows you mentioned, only Squid Game and EAW were namedropped by Netflix to investors. All of Us Are Dead might have been as well.\n\nCLOY doesn't qualify because Netflix has gone on record saying that this show's huge success was concentrated in Asia only, which is a reason why they're remaking it.\n\nThe Glory's total watch time falls significantly short of Squid Game and AOUS's.",

If a project is not mentioned, then it wasn't regarded internally as a key success. What other publicly available, reliable indicator would we have to go by ? # of Twitter mentions? CLOY is an example that top 10 lists, viewership, \"buzz\" don't fully map to how Netflix evaluates success (I was really surprised when I read the CLOY bit too).",

Every step is interlocked. To be brutally cynical, there's not a lot of social mobility these days. \n\nReborn/revenge stories allow viewers to live vicariously, even though it might feel extremely unrealistic. It gives us hope that, we'd make better/smarter decisions if we can change the *one* thing we can't \u2014 our birth, our family status, time. And you look not just at TV or movies, even webtoons are filled with reborn/revenge stories. The more people feel helpless and stuck, the more they want to fantasise a way out.

Revenge, in the context of a well done comedy subplot, is totally fine, but outside of it, it seems sometimes hard to swallow. \n\nI agree, like the article says, that if it is done well, it provides a level of catharsis.  But I think a cathartic endings without explicit, malicious revenge is key.  \"Catharsis\" for a demographic can be very different to another, as well.\n\nOne of the most recent good examples of a cathartic-ish ending with a good plot, in my opinion, is \"Under the Queens Umbrella\".  There is a level of revenge at the end but also there's sympathy and history behind the villain.  The main character acknowledges the villain as a strong person who chose to do evil over time, but still a strong person with issues nonetheless.\n\nI think this is important.  Revenge for the sake of revenge alongside a weak and poorly-written villain is a bore and unrealistic.  A baby doesn't seek to be a villain or seek revenge naturally.  It's a series of events that push them towards it.\n\nThere are times where the main villain uses revenge as their driving point.  It's fine, but I often find it to be fairly shallow in kdramas.  Most of the time, their grudges could be resolved over a cup of coffee early on (ex, it's really just a misunderstanding gone wrong).  \n\nWhen they become very evil and vengeful over nothing, and DON'T attempt communication, it seems just like a teenager being an ignorant brat emotionally.  \n\nWhat it ends up seeming like is a mental disorder because X person couldn't get some therapy and get their shit in order.  Then they blow everything up.  Which is probably unsurprising with korean culture since the idea therapy, while growing, seems to be fairly spare.",

Although i don't want to minimise abuse and its impact, it's virtually impossible to judge and cancel every single bully in life and see justice. \n\nSure, there is something gratifying about seeing this play out on TV. But it also makes real life a little less bearable and sad. \n\nI never come away from these shows feeling more empowered or with greater capacity for self compassion.

It's good that The Glory is shedding light on bullying in real life but in Korean entertainment we can obviously see why more shows are taking this route now. Weak Hero Class 1 and The Glory are great shows but the violence was very triggering. The future shows also are gonna take the route of \"show more bullying violence to make the revenge satisfactory\" route. A good show must make you root for its protagonist with its writing and not by shwoing violence aesthetically. I feel like this is gonna be like 13 Reasons Why where they thought it's gonna shed light on suicides and self harm but it only increased more cases of suicides and self harm",

There were one period in the past, there were quite a number of revenge Kdramas, targeting the powerful and wealthy class. \n\nI do wish to see revenge as main theme in US TV series since there is increasing number of white collar crimes, scammers, human traffickers, extreme wealthy class exploit workers, and bad politicians that purposely pass bad policies that have blood in their hands, but there is no justice for the victims and the people whose lives are destroyed.",

I wonder if there are less US shows that tackle the revenge theme in the context of social/class structure because it is generally a more egalitarian society (outside of cities with wider economic gaps like NYC and LA?) so maybe not as \"relatable\" for a wider audience? I didn't notice this until you pointed it out.",

I tend to think US entertainment industry doesn't see the concept of revenge. They prefer the idea of \"heroes\" to save world by fighting against the unrealistic \"villains\" who, some of them, are actually revenging against the \"system\" that has destroyed their lives. Think of \"Joker\" in Batman. He is a villain that is written to be crazy, which everyone rallies to fight against him. What if they write a villain that is the bad politicians who destroy the middle class, take away some group's rights, take away someone's children due to gun violence. That is too real for Americans to swallow and the wealthy sponsors won't sponsor any anti-heroes that revenge against their evilness and the system itself. Additionally, we don't know if the American screenwriters have the creativity to write a revenge story like **Taxi Driver** and **The Glory**, since they tend to  write plots that use guns or killing to solve everything, like **YellowStone**, etc. Have we seen an American anti-hero character that uses shady strategy within legal bound to put their villains (realistic ones) in prison or destroy the villain life since the villain has destroys so many people's lives? May be the closest one is **The Good Fight** but it its a dark satire that doesn't seem to have much effect, except for a good laugh.",

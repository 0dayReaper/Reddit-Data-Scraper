She would have come up with the kid story in order to beg, hoping the organization would have mercy on her and allow her to leave.

You 'kimchi c\\*nts' (that's one of the most common slurs against Korean women used by Korean men) are just trying to make Korea look bad! Shut the Fuck up!\"",

I feel like it was no more sexist or misogynistic than any other Kdrama I've seen like obviously there are characters in the show who definitely are very misogynistic like, Jang Deok-su, but that's just how their character is, it isn't really representative of how the wider show wants to portray female characters, especially when they very clearly want you to hate Jang Deok-su and there is a strong female character in Kang Sae-byeok.",

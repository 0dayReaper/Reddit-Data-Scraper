            "comment": "This absolutely ridiculous show is bringing so much unexpected joy into my life when I really needed it! I've watched through episode 14 so far. I fast forward through a lot of the side characters' time on screen. I'm not as interested in the side plotting with ML's siblings and I find the grandmother really hard to handle in large doses of screen time. (Episode 12 was so hard to get through because everyone was so horrible to Yeon Doo. Sometimes feels like she has no one in her corner!)\n\nI also feel like they're trying to make Se Jin into a more sympathetic character by showing how HORRENDOUS her mother is (by far the worst character), but I find it hard to feel sorry for her. She's a good antagonist though. I honestly &gt;!laughed out loud when she showed up at Yeon Doo's birthday dinner in all black like she was going to a funeral!&lt;! I also keep waiting for Yeon Doo &gt;!to connect the dots that Se Jin was the OW in the car with Joon Ha!&lt;.\n\nIt is taking me some time to warm up to the ML (I also find his acting pretty wooden), but I do think he has good chemistry with FL, so I enjoy the main couple together. It already feels like a slow burn, although I realize there are 50 episodes so we'll see. \n\nThe only thing I'm slightly confused about is &gt;!the connection between Yeon Doo's brother and Tae Kyung's youngest sister. At first I thought he was her ex, and that she had a baby in secret and went to the US after that, leaving him to raise their child. Am I totally reading that wrong? Show seems to be hinting that he's just a lookalike? Or was the lack of birthmark on his back a red herring? It seems like if that was him, he'd definitely recognize the mother of his daughter?!&lt;",

Jay (Gong Yoo-Myung's ex) and Dong-Wook (Yeon Doo's brother) are really **just** lookalikes. \n\nDong-Wook's ex hasn't been revealed, but Yoo-Myung is definitely not it because he would've recognized her, and he wouldn't have to tell her that he's a dad. \n\nGiven that this is a longer soap, it is definitely possible that they'll make Jay and Dong-Wook cousins. After all, last week's episodes showed the Uncle getting told by a random lady that he should take good care of his son when his uncle is a single man with no partners or known kids. BUT it's unlikely because the scene was probably inserted for comedic effect",

But the last few episodes have put her in a downhill domestic situation where almost everyone hates her and all she's trying to prove is that she's a good wife. Couple with trusting the ex fiance Se Jin so blindly...writing notes that anyone can see...leaving mobile behind...This is supposed to be a star teacher? All they have shown in terms of her being different is opposing to the tyrannic grand aunty just by being funny. But in the last 8 episodes her character took such a REGRESSIVE direction, a complete u turn from first 8 episodes. Yes its funny and I enjoy the characters being weird but I enjoyed the show more when FL was more independent in her thinking, brave and smart. Now they have turned her into a damsel in distress that needs saving all the time, that too not because of her pregnancy just generally she needs saving from a random family situation. \n\nApart from the ONE date the story showing in first 8 episodes, there haven't been any strong ML-FL scenes. I understand they want to take it slow but the FL being smart and ML-FL interactions were the best part of the show but it seems less...flavourful in terms of a romcom. I feel disappointed and if her character continues to be like a sad FL that needs saving more than half of the time and isn't really smart, then I will stop watching the show",

However, I also view it from a different perspective, considering everything that has gone wrong for her since episode 1. The pregnancy was a turning point, as she lost her job, her relationship with her mom became strained because her mom won't accept her without her husband, and her in-laws put her through literal hell. She feels trapped and unable to escape, which I think is a big reason why she's starting to fall apart.\n\nI agree that it would be helpful if the show could flesh out the FL's relationship with TK. Perhaps they could find a way to work together, whether romantically or platonically, to plot their next steps rather than relying on spontaneous lies. I think this could boost her confidence and help her become a stronger character.",

Her reliance to ML also explains his increasing stock price over the past few episodes\u2014a perfect time for ep17 to tease a romantic development.\n\nSo far it makes sense for FL to start falling for ML, but I wonder how ML will fall for FL?

            "comment": "I'm at ep14 right now but will definitely have 16 done as it airs this weekend. This drama is so absurd. Funny, and some of the characters are a bit much (Joseon Granny, 2nd FL, the sister-in-laws to name a few) but the pacing on this is very nice and quick. And, for the most part, communication, hasn't been an issue either. No noble idiocy nor anyone playing dumb. Appreciate all that in this kind of drama. I'm not sure how they are going to keep carrying this story for the entire 50 episodes, but it's definitely still a fun, yet utterly ridiculous, watch.\n\nHopefully they tone down some of the 2nd leads/ex's BS or at least channel it into a less annoying path. Can only take so much of either of them. And want the 1st leads to finally make their relationship real for a couple of reasons. First so we can get the conniving ex-boyfriend/baby daddy involved again. And second so that the couple can be happy together/have each other's backs. With the sheer types and amounts of characters available to create drama there is still plenty of drama to unfold/create itself. These families are something else.\n\nCan't wait for &gt;!when the ML's younger sister and the FL's younger brother figure out who each other are and very likely hook up. Definitely think that's a real possibility given the whole look alike ex that is not a twin.!&lt;\n\nAnd I loved episode 14 &gt;!when ML defended FL against her ex-coworkers! That was written in such a clever way which really showed the ML's true feelings and stuck to that jerk of a co-worker.!&lt;\n\nAnd because it is so engaging I've been using this to test my Korean language skills as well. I watch without subtitles and then re-watch with subtitles later. Started mostly because I got impatient and wanted to know what was going to happen. But the language is fairly simple so I have been able to get the gist of most conversations and then pick up the details with the subtitles. It's been helpful. Would recommend that for anyone learning Korean.",

I understand people are probably used to 16 episode dramas, but as someone who grew up watching South African soapies and shows like Passions, this show has an element of nostalgia for me. The slower pace and ensemble cast are really nice. Everyone gets their own story.\n\n I hope ML will fall for the FL first. He'd make such a good stepdad because he understands the single mom thing and he's caring with the niece. He also enjoys the FL's family and I don't want him to lose a safe space. Grandma really got what she deserved in episode 16, but I'm surprised the family hasn't picked up on it. This show seems to reveal most things pretty quickly, so I don't think grandma's secret will stay hidden for that long.",

The show is so over the top but in a weirdly delightful way. \n\nI definitely fast-forward through anything that feels annoying (mainly when it's the grandmother, Se Jin and/or her family, or the parents in scenes alone). \n\nI have no real feelings about the younger brother and younger sister - no interest there, waiting for something to happen besides establishing that he is a lookalike.\n\nThe scenes between ML and FL, and between them  and the siblings, are my favorites. Ep 13-14 was a good lineup of plot points and funny developments. Also glad to see ML grow a bit of backbone and stand up for FL in certain situations \n\nCan't say whether any of these actors are talented (such ridiculous material they are given to work with). I remember the main male actor from Cinderella and the Four Knights and thought he was better there (actually liked him more than the ML in that drama). Maybe it takes a couple episodes for him to warm up... now that we're a third of the way through.",

Interesting how that'll develop because till now Sejin has done so so so much wrong her one pretentious act of kindness shouldn't really change anyting in real life, but ah well. \n\nI like how they made the grandmother illiterate to humble her down real quick. \n\nI am also liking the weird twin Jay plot development, and I like the energy the female actress brings here. Other than this I still don't really care about all the side characters or side stories. They have failed to keep me fully captivated and seem like fillers. \n\n I also abhor these dumb loopholes in the story. Why would you shout out a secret (which is literally the foundation of their whole lives right now) out for everyone to hear? \ud83d\ude02 And really? Sejin just WALKED in the rain all the way and met Taekyung at the exact time he was coming out? Also there was so much space on the bed but the FL kept rolling over\ud83d\ude02 I'll excuse that because its a trope I liked. \n\nMy dudes, dont forget: Sejin caused the divorce of her own parents who seem in distress and in pain. She has left her father bleeding literally multiple times. the writer-nims are trying to show she liked taekyung or something but the feelings dont mean anything if she's trying to achieve her goal in such an artificial way. disgusting still",

You said you would fall for the ML if it weren't for the baby. Now the ML has fallen in love and he wants to date and take care of baby. Everyone is ok and everything can be worked out except the FL acting weird? If you like him and he likes you, whats the problem???? It's like the show writers are going to take another 10-15 episodes for FL to figure out that she really likes the ML. Come on. They had their first date in ep 2 or something lol\n\n2. The show has screwed up age timeline for the niece-child. They called her 12 years old. First of all, she looks 6 years old and she is literally 9 years old in real life. Her dad says he had her when he was 18, and the show has implied that he's in his mid-twenties, so nothing makes sense on this front because in that case she should be 7. Lol? \n\n3. Why is Sejin always in taekyung's house when personal matters are being discussed? why is she always lurking and sneaking without being noticed? these guys don't have one single security camera? lol. Legit all her misdoings can be resolved by installing 3-4 security cameras everywhere\ud83d\ude02 \n\n4. Who gave the grandmother the right to interfere in company inheritance when it didn't belong to her family???\n\n5. The SML was head of a medical company in first 10 episodes. That's how he meets ML at a single mother's awareness campaign event. Now he suddenly went to US and started a youtube channel. The youtube channel became famous and a golf selling company (taekyung's dad's company) wants to work with him on m&amp;a deals LIKE WHAT THE F IS GOING ON IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE \n\nTHE BIGGEST, BIGGEST LOOPHOLE:\nHow is the FL not even showing yet?????? Hasn't it been 3 months at least? from almost wedding to moving in to moving in the main house then back in the annex and EVERYTHING in the story has moved ahead except there are no visible changes to her body (minus the ailments they mention) where is the bump????? its been 22 episodes!!!!\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

Especially at 50 episodes and only showing 2 on a weekend. \nThis is my 1st time on Reddit and I\u2019m not 100 percent if this counts as a \n\nspoiler: &gt;!but the FL is extremely annoying to me except for episode 20. She\u2019s a roller coaster of weak and timid and drives me nuts. And the ML is a great actor but his character until episode 20 can\u2019t seem to figure out if he\u2019s in love with the FL or not! I\u2019ve never wanted to choke out grandmas but this one might be the exception (character wise and in a hypothetical scenario) I\u2019m sure the actress is a lovely lady chill! This rich family is one hell of a spicy toxic stew of red flags!!&lt;",

And some characters are just written for you to hate. \n\nWeekend dramas require a lot of patience but on the bright side you're almost half way through.",

This is incredibly faithful to the manhwa so far which is surprising and frankly appreciated. It's beautifully shot. I love the characters. And this is a super angsty, but ultimately very sweet, love story. One of the main leads thinks he is 100% straight (newsflash - not as straight as he thought - and it's fun to watch the lights flicker on about that!) plus the two main leads lie to each other and try to figure out how to get through it. The secondary leads are incredibly funny together as they have known each other all their lives.\n\nKorean BLs have been getting much better recently which is nice to see! Between this, A Shoulder to Cry On, Our Dating Sim and All the Liquors. It's been kind of an embarrassment of riches in this genre right now.\n\neta: except I miss Bean! In the manhwa Tae Joon has a dog named Bean! Bean loves Won Young probably more than Tae Joon!",

But then again the thing I love about the Japanese ones (over Thai for example) is that it's actors doing a role vs doing a role to become an actor. That creates more mature themes, characters, plots, etc. It feels like Korea might be taking the lead from Japan on that...which I hope so! I really want more mature dramas in general but especially for BLs. It's not just important but also interesting. We shall see.",

Angst is kinda hit or miss about this kind of thing in real life, and can be just more of a \"huh\" type of thing. Like the lights coming on while working it out. At least for me it was and I know I am not the only one as it comes up in conversations. And this is actually my favorite trope in BLs probably because I can identify with it so heavily. Not the \"I'm only in love with this one guy\" trope but the \"huh...do I like him, want to be him or want to be friends with him...\" type of trope (the current  Thai drama \"A Boss and a Babe\" is a great example of the same trope as the same thing is going on).",

Still like the interactions and secrets. I\u2019m wondering if the guys Won Young keeps talking to from work had a hand in getting him fired. \n\nThe way the show is shot really feels different than other lower budget dramas. That and the length really make it feel higher budget, and it is shot beautiful. The locations by the sea are gorgeous. \n\nWill say I really like Kim Dong Hee so far. He\u2019s so cute and fun, and his actor Han Do Woo is charming. I think I saw him in Our Gab Soon but can\u2019t recall exactly what character.",

A lot of BL fans like more electric chemistry or enemies to lovers tropes so this one feels a bit different. \n\nThat semi confession scene by the water was sweet and I loved the emotions both actors showed through little looks. Having seen their other works I think both are decent though maybe not top level. \n\nWill say barista owner is a standout, mostly for a great personality and smile.

Tae Joon is very serious which balances out Won Young\u2019s energy.\n\nSad about his room, but I do wonder why his host lady looked so happy telling him he was getting kicked out haha\n\nHappy Won Young\u2019s moral compass hasn\u2019t totally failed him when he was snooping through the room, and he\u2019s quick to apologize. Honestly for a relationship built on ulterior motives they actually communicate pretty clearly.\n\nI was giddy the whole episode. The whole series is charming and I hope it continues to the end.\n\nI also really have to praise the stylists here, especially for Tae Joon and Dong Hee.\n\nThis series is also giving me major flashbacks to my high school ceramics class, especially the coiling scene. Love the attention to detail.\n\nNice episode, now onto episode 4\u2026.\n\n**Episode 4**\n\nOh dang nearly 40 minutes! \n\n\u201cBut why am I nervous?\u201d Because you like dudes my dude! Or at least one dude.\n\nI loved the scene with Tae Joon and the professor in the hospital. You can tell he probably sees him more as a father figure than his own dad. I also like the angst with the dude outside the room (I freakin thought he was Lee Joon at first lol). Not sure if an ex or old friend, but TJ\u2019s dad obviously paid him to stay away\u2026which is going to make Won Young\u2019s true reasons for getting close hurt even more.\n\nI honestly expected WY to crash the Mercedes. Also don\u2019t know what he was thinking about the water, but glad the scene ended up being hilarious. I\u2019ve seen many serious mouth-to-mouth scenes.\n\nOoh we\u2019re getting some Ho Tae and Dong Hee context. Ho Tae seems to have liked Dong Hee since high school. Excited to see how they develop.\n\nOH. MY. GOD. That scene by the water at the end was wonderful and made even my heart flutter. \n\nI\u2019m crossing my fingers, knocking on wood, and sacrificing a fake goat, but this show is truly shaping up to be an outstanding drama. We\u2019re not even halfway done though so I\u2019m hoping for the best. If it continues like this it may become my favorite Korean BL.",

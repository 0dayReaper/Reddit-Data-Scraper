It's also fascinating to see the progression of hairstyles as the main character changes. In Suspicious Partner, the FLs hair started out pretty messy, with her emulating that. She was a messy, busy, funny lawyer. As the drama progressed and so did her romance with the ML, her hair became straighter and more put together, and the same can be said for her outfits. It was one of the first times that the change in hair and outfits in a k-drama stood out to me, because you could immediately tell that the director wanted the audience to perceive her differently in different parts of the show.",

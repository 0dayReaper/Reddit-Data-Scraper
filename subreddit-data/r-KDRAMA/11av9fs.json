And it looks like he\u2019s a great singer too! (That is, if he\u2019s actually the one singing or they\u2019re using a ghost singer)\n- This episode made me realize how hilarious timjamning can be. His scenes had me laughing while questioning my own conscience.\n- The raffle scene had me rolling. mr. choi and mr. park killed it again.\n- I love you, Pyo Ye Jin!!!!!\n- This entire episode felt unecessarily prolonged, but hey, at least i got to laugh again and again.\n- Was a little unsatisfied with &gt;!the end of sanggi\u2019s punishment because i thought it will only make him greedier and more unhinged in the long run, but i was good the moment dokki mentioned landmines lol!&lt;\n- All those red flags has to be some reference to shin jae ha\u2019s character right lol\n- I hate victim blaming, but I swear, Timjangnim and company better be &gt;!waiting for shin jae ha\u2019s ass down that tunnel. Timjangnim saw him push that cabinet! If that wasn\u2019t red flag enough, he should seriously upgrade his glasses!&lt;\n\nCan\u2019t wait for next week!

But seems like they still intended to leave the loose ends from Case 1. I wonder if they will get back to Case 1 again to reveal who is the sniper in the end.",

Edit: Can't get over how President Jang looked like a proud dad during Goeun's performance and even praised her later, I love this family.  \nOn Hajoon you sneaky little...they really should lock up Goeun's booth or at least not have the keys for the staff room out in the open.  \n&gt;!Nice reference to Baek Sungmi!&lt;  I like how they tie back in season 1 with the little references.  \nLooking forward to Dogi and Goeun being an undercover couple.",

            "comment": "Okay, I'm 8 min into ep 3 and it reminded me of a tidbit a kfan spotted in ep 1. &gt;!There was a book, half-opened faced down, on Do Ki's desk which the title roughly translates to \"Trauma, does it come from the outside, or does it come from me?\" So Do Ki has been trying hard to get over his PTSD all this while since S1 \ud83d\ude2d!&lt;\n\nWill add more comments here after I'm done.\n\nETA ep 3 comments:\n\n1: This week's case is so sad. &gt;!That man is such a scum to cheat the elderly of their money, feelings, honour and support, and even call them after escaping to tell them to just die??? Wtf???? I can't wait for justice to be served to him UGH.!&lt;\n\n2: I'm so happy Do Ki has been &gt;!working hard to overcome his trauma. It definitely isn't easy but at least he's trying. I love that the show is letting us in on his process!&lt; and they're not taking it lightly.\n\n3: There's no proper translation for this but Do Ki is a \u95f7\u9a9a little piece of shit hahaha or he's a \ub610\ub77c\uc774 underneath that sane exterior. \u95f7\u9a9a is a Chinese term to describe someone who seems reserved but the more you know them or the more comfortable they get with you, the weirder or crazier they turn out to be. \ub610\ub77c\uc774 is Korean for someone who is out of their mind or so funny or weird that everyone thinks they're crazy. His undercovers are all crazy HAHAHAHA I LOVE IT\n\n4: Another case of lacking continuity in ep 3... the bad police chief was shot right at his heart but a snapshot of him dead on the floor showed he was shot on the right side of his chest \ud83e\udee5\n\n5: It's hilarious that Kyung Koo and Jin Eon are top-class engineers but they're so innocent and silly in the team. I'm sorry for laughing at this but Jin Eon and Do Ki are in a toxic relationship \ud83d\ude4a\ud83d\ude4a The way Jin Eon's like \"Isn't Do Ki so sweet \ud83d\ude0d how is he so sweet \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\" at the smallest gesture, and Kyung Koo having to remind him what Do Ki did to him on their missions was hilarious. Bro really forgot Do Ki stripped him in public and almost drowned him in the sea last season. But it's also a good reminder to all of us that Do Ki is actually volatile under his calm disposition. I like that the show makes it clear that these characters may be heroes on the show but it doesn't necessarily mean that what they're doing is actually good\u2013they're grey (they literally killed someone. Sure, it was the gross U-Data boss but they killed someone).\n\n6: I keep seeing that people are expecting the newbie to be the big boss villain. This is the first time I'm seeing him but it seems like he played villain roles before? I hope he turns out to be like Kim Eui Sung then\u2013everyone thought he'd be the big boss villain in S1 but he was one of the good guys till the end (though his character is grey, he's on the hero team). This \"Is he, is he not? He must be!\" thing from fellow viewers annoys me because I prefer to just absorb the story as presented without being affected by factors outside of the story, so if he turns out to be on the hero team, I would feel bad for the actor to be typecast so early in his career.\n\n7: The fight scenes don't feel as satisfying as S1. Like I said in the last post: S2 seems to be missing a bit of the punch or \uc2dc\uc6d0\ud568 S1 had. Am I the only one feeling that way?\n\nETA ep 4 comments:\n\n8: This ep pretty much confirmed for me that S2 is missing the punchy, dynamic essence that made people love S1. The relationship within the team is great, there is a stronger sense of camaraderie now but there's just something missing from S2.\n\n9: I want well-shot scenes of Do Ki fighting \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d Part of the reason Taxi Driver is so popular is the action but it's like they're patronising us with the bare minimum now.\n\n10: Actually, it would be nice if the new guy turns out to be someone who benefited from the team's service in the past instead of being the undercover villain. &gt;!The fact that he's suspicious and tried to snoop around when he had the chance to goes to show that he might be aware something secretive is going on. I just feel that it's way too clich\u00e9 and predictable if he turns out to be a bad guy.!&lt;\n\n11: Is that Ha Do Kwon at the end? The voice and silhouette of the face remind me of him.",

The official investigations and court referred to their materials). His issues were weak transitions between the actor and stuntman (caused a bit of hoo-ha in Korea) and creating a problem with the original scriptwriter who walked away from the project halfway through S1 (many believe the ratings would've been higher if not for this, including SBS since they got back the original scriptwriter for S2 and changed the director).\n\nS2 is Lee Dan's debut as a director so there is no info on what she has worked on before. Her rookie mistakes like the continuity issue I pointed out are a bit glaring since we already have a previous season to compare to. The punchiness and satisfaction of the fighting improved a little bit in ep 3 so hopefully her improvement really shows through in ep 4, which is usually the point where viewers decide to continue or drop the show.",

S1 also dealt with the whole ethical aspect of their service which is not an issue in this season and is probably more to the writers liking hence the creative difference issue with the director back then. A bit of a shift in tone was what I expected tbh.",

This show has been like the american series Leverage...a team of talented and very human characters that bring justice for those ignored or left behind. In many ways Taxi Driver is an anthology series, we constantly get new stories along with the character arcs of our heroes.Those stories are NOT incidental, a framework for our team to show their stuff, but integral to our emotional connection and investment. Like today's episode...kind of knew it was coming, but couldn't help feeling ourselves enraged.",

            "comment": "Ep 3 Review:\n\nThe starting really makes me almost tear up, seeing &gt;!KDK trying so hard to overcome his fear of the whistle because of the murder years ago!&lt;. Though I'm guessing &gt;!he seems like he is still not able to!&lt;. I'm really &gt;!hoping he can overcome this fear!&lt;, though &gt;!I doubt is not really possible!&lt;. But seems like there might be a reason they show us this part. Maybe &gt;!KDK might have to face his fear at some point during the mission!&lt;.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm wondering who the &gt;!sniper is in Vietnam because in episode 3 they are still leaving us hanging who is actually the sniper. They only drop some hints about how did the shooting happen, but still didn't reveal who is the person behind!&lt;. It's frustrating. But given he is at the scene, I just kept feeling the&gt;! KDK is in some danger still. His team operation might be at risk of being exposed given a 3rd party saw everything.!&lt;\n\nAnd about the newcomer, I'm wondering what is really his role. I'm sure if they add him to the drama, there must be some reason for it. &gt;!Also, is weird that why during his 1st time out on the road, he caused scratches to the car. The next time he came in with the taxi front damaged badly.!&lt; I'm very curious about what he really does when he is on the road. Also, &gt;!I'm wondering if would he be one of the undercover!&lt; like what many said in the comment section.\n\nFurthermore, also seems like, after the whole fiasco, &gt;!the trot singer scamming schemes still continues!&lt;. But I feel that when their &gt;!lorry broke down, it seems like might be the rainbow team doing, in the purpose of making them get onto KDK tractor!&lt;. Waiting for tonight's ep to see how everything will go. Excited for today's ep.\n\nEp 4 Update (Updated):\n\nJust knew it, the &gt;!newcomer is up to no good!&lt;. This guy really &gt;!infuriates me, trying to sneak into the secret compartment. And he in the end manage to went in. This means he will know the secret place. How I wish they actually kept the keys so that no one will be able to get hold of them. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!And someone is taking photos of them, I wonder what is really the motive really. !&lt;Why am I worried about their safety? Honestly, either the police or the bad guy who is &gt;!following the rainbow team just doesn't feel good!&lt;. If it's the &gt;!police then they might be brought to the authorities for their activities!&lt;. Though so far in this season they didn't do anything that's &gt;!illegal unlike last season where they threw all the bad guys into their rented prison!&lt;. If it is the &gt;!bad guys, then their lives might be in danger since they knew all their schemes!&lt;.\n\nFor some reason, when &gt;!Director Jang jump down to the sea, why I kept thinking of Penthouse \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 When SSR  jumped down but still alive in the end. !&lt;\n\nAlso, the irony when the he sung this part:\n\n[https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1a8e920d34dff56b69ef13f80acb8d245e70d0c4198b02a6eba5c33b193a6a61.png](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1a8e920d34dff56b69ef13f80acb8d245e70d0c4198b02a6eba5c33b193a6a61.png)\n\nThen &gt;!Director Jang used his walking stick to hit that guy, literally signalling him that I'll never trust you lol!&lt;. Seems like he still don't get it haha.\n\n[https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56e7a82bf2b38d454a1fccef9b43bde3582a7ef93b9ce07cba7fb387e16d0ecc.png](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56e7a82bf2b38d454a1fccef9b43bde3582a7ef93b9ce07cba7fb387e16d0ecc.png)\n\nHaha, the part where &gt;!Goeun was chased by the trio, but Do Ki with the tractor hinder their chase!&lt; was so funny. And whenever the tractor appears, the BGM plays it's so suiting. \n\n[https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/80f25df294bb703a4f1feef78445f5750ba88f8ead86cbebdf84afdee7b9b607.png](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/80f25df294bb703a4f1feef78445f5750ba88f8ead86cbebdf84afdee7b9b607.png)\n\nOn the other hand, the map really doesn't look like something real lol, do they really think people really will come out with a map to indicate where is the treasure? Only story book will do that. Seriously, they really believe made me find them pretty stupid actually.\n\nAlso, when they though they found the real deal, but was actually just a &gt;!poop!&lt;. But they still don't want to give up. Really?? They are just too greedy,\n\n[https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b8801622fd07f1d8c4a5b272a5ccfdf22922d4c0def1c87a66b47329a79a80ca.png](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b8801622fd07f1d8c4a5b272a5ccfdf22922d4c0def1c87a66b47329a79a80ca.png)\n\nHaha and seeing that &gt;!scammer trying so hard to find the money is so funny. !&lt;Really he is just too persistent. And the last part where that greedy man ends up finding the mine instead of the treasure really serves him right. He literally lost everything, I wonder if he will even make it alive out from the mine that he was stepping on. \n\nThis just goes to show that one should never be greedy because greed will only end one in tragedy.\n\nI saw the teaser and I'm going crazy! Because &gt;!OMG!!! SERIOUSLY, KDK JUST PROPOSE TO GOEUN!!!!!! DO YOU WANT TO MARRY ME \\~KDK TO GOEUN!&lt;I'm in shocked and shooked now!! [GIF 1 Teaser](https://giphy.com/gifs/ddLbv7QH1qKzhNM7dk), [GIF 2 Teaser](https://giphy.com/gifs/j3VZTyK5iOW4G3fy2Y), [My Reaction](https://giphy.com/gifs/P9yKlMCozm1LE0xgJn) But I'm wondering if the &gt;!proposal!&lt; is for the undercover or for real haha.\n\nBut I think overall, ep 3 &amp; 4 (case 2) is quite hilarious compared to other episodes that tend to be more dark in nature. These 2 episodes have quite a lot of laughing points and as usual the BGM are always on point.",

Anyway if it is Hajoon and he's evil, it seems like a pretty obvious hint too so maybe it's not what I think it is?",

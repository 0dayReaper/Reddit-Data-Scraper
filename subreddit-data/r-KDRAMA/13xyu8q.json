            "comment": "Romance might be the main theme of some of these dramas, but I particularly liked them because of how they highlight the career of a main character. \n\n**Her Private Life**\n\nGood Things: A very interesting career as a curator. It's definitely not your usual career. I actually am now working in a new role that has a relationship with a curator. I thought some of the characters were a bit dramatic, but it's not too far from reality it seems.\r  \n\r  \nBad Things: I found some of the characters a little annoying and pointless, and that the relationship management between the characters at the gallery was also not realistic in a work environment. \r  \n\r  \nInteresting Things: The painting that drew the main characters, a supporting character together was interesting\r  \n\r  \nSpotlight On Because: If you're into a Rom Com, definitely a top choice. I'm not artistic at all, but a romance outside of a typical office, but also not a countryside/highschool/college setting is really nice. It was the first drama around art that I watched. \n\n**What's Wrong with Secretary Kim**\n\nGood Things: It essentially is the gold standard for a rom com, especially for CEO - worker romance. Funny, decent plot, has some angsty, unique characters.\r  \n\r  \nBad Things: ML's personality can rub you the wrong way.\r  \n\r  \nInteresting Things: I strive to have the FL's fashion sense, as I myself work as a secretary (although my boss is not some hot CEO, he's a Director who is my mother's age). \r  \n\r  \nSpotlight On Because: As I said before, this is the gold standard of a rom com - no complicated story, some angst but not dramatic, FL is very likeable and hardworking. It's not entirely like my own life as a secretary (the drama portrays a personal assistant, whereas I'm an executive assistant, so I don't deal with his personal things besides from booking and calendars). When I watched this, I was brand new at the role, and now I'm 4 years into it.",

                    "comment": "&gt;**What's Wrong with Secretary Kim**\n\nOne of the things I liked was how when they started dating, she set boundaries for their professional life, and she also called him out on how he was looking down on the office work she did as a PA and made him reassess that. In the usual kind of story we'd be primed for her to leave the company and do her own thing and be her own boss following her dream and all-\n\n\\-but she stays on as his PA, and that's okay, becasue she is really, really, **really** good at her job. There's nothing wrong with being a PA. She's not settling for what she can get, she is a subject matter expert in her field.\n\nAnd yeah, her fashion was on point, whether attending parties or in the office. As an aside, I like how they used fashion as part of the character design and diffentiating the three women - Kim Mi-so is professional in pencil skirts and straight cut blouses, Kim Ji-a wears a-line skirts and flowy blouses, and Bong Se-ra wears dresses - their fashion is a reflection of their character/personalities.",

            "comment": "**The Producers** (2015)\n\nA mockumentary romcom centering variety shows and idol industry. The story is about the pds from top KBS shows 2d1n and music bank, their struggle, work and personal life and their friendship. Also touches the dark side of idol industry as a side plot. \n\nThe drama is shot in an interview style like lovestruck in the city and the cast are perfect for their roles. Variety star cha Tae hyun acts as the pd for 2d1n, the show he himself was a cast member irl, IU as an idol, gong hyo Jin as the pd for music bank and Kim soo hyun in a surprising comic role as rookie pd. \n\nThe downside is, it does not have a tight plot or a high quality like recent drama, but a fun watch esp if you love variety shows.",

            "comment": "Call it Love\n\nGood: The ml's quiet emotional intelligence, the homey office atmosphere, the refreshing sml, the moody cinematography, the quiet romance , the minutiae of the character's lives. \n\nBad: The fl's negative character development, she went from bold to deer in headlights,  it's a very very slow drama u gotta be in a certain mood, the fl's sister had an unsatisfactory character journey, the kumbaya ending esp for the bad guys \n\nI found it interesting bc the ml is just so overwhelmed with things out of his control, his back is literally bent, as a result he just ignores the things that could be in his control. Also I liked all the love and care the little brother got. \n\nIt's one of the very few melo/slice of life type dramas I've watched and for the first 11ish eps i dont think i skipped a scene, if you like that kind of stuff give it a try.",

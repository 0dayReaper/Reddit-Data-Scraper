    "postText": "[Hello](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) and welcome to Kim Tan's Talk Time (Tuesday)! \n\nThis is a free-for-all discussion in which *almost* anything goes, don't diss *The Heirs* or break any of our other core rules. General discussion about anything and everything is allowed. \n\nConsider this post a refuge from all the memes and fanart that are  pouring in and enjoy the peace and quiet. Think of it as Tan's family  wine cellar, [the perfect place to chill out from the world](https://i.imgur.com/ZbVbp0Z.png) in a fabulous sweater and have a little chat.\n\n**Who is this Kim Tan I keep hearing about and why does he have not one, but two threads dedicated to him?** Good questions. If you take a look through our [glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions), you will find all the answers you seek;\n\n&gt;**KIM TAN** is the lead male in [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA)\u2019s favourite drama, [The Heirs](https://mydramalist.com/6640-the-heirs). He\u2019s kind of the worst but he has great sweaters so it balances out. \u201cKim Tan\u201d is used in three ways on [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA); 1) when referring to [Lee Min Ho\u2019s](https://i.redd.it/pitmvu1zghg31.gif) seminal character in *The Heirs*, 2) when referring to Automod (alt. [Tan Bot](https://i.redd.it/qr33zzkhwgg31.gif))   - \u201cKim Tan is feeling very triggered by my post\u201d, \u201cS\\*\\*\\*! Tan Bot just   ate my post\u201d, 3) In place of \u201cGod\u201d or other deities - \u201cFor the love of [Kim Tan](https://i.redd.it/lus5duqssgg31.gif?)!\u201d    \n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points or  anything you think should be redacted**.  If you are using Markdown and not  Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way  to create spoiler tags is to use  &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without  spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

An elderly man, who was getting off at the same station as me, walked towards the train doors as we arrived at our stop, but then paused and reached down to pick up the young man's phone, headphones and cap, which had fallen to the floor during his slumber, and gently placed the items on the sleeping man's lap.\n\nIt was a beautiful moment to witness.",

Even if you don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.\n\nthis is quote from [the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) on r/Blind, and they also have [a dandy infographic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/141fdje/reddit_is_killing_3rdparty_apps_and_api_access/) that sums the thing well",

            "comment": "I finished **Prison Playbook**. The cast was great! Everyone played their role wonderfully. Honourable mention to Park Hosan, who played Kaist. He was hilarious and gave life to every scene he was in. I liked the first 8/9 episodes, which was more light-hearted and extremely hilarious. The first couple of episodes revolve around the cell mates finding ways to break some of the not-too-grave prison rules in order to make life more bearable. The (mis)adventures of Kaist, for me, were the best part of the show. The episode where &gt;!he tries to smuggle cigarettes in to prison!&lt; was my favourite and I could not stop laughing. From episode 10, it became tedious to watch. I think when the ML had to overcome challenge after challenge after challenge, I got a bit bored. It felt like ML had been in jail for 3 years instead of one by the end of the show. I may be judging a bit too harshly because poor man was going through it in jail, but I didn\u2019t sense any growth in ML by the end of the show. All other characters experienced some form of growth, whether it be reforming &gt;!(Jean Valjean, his prison dad, jailbird)!&lt;, choosing to stand up for themselves &gt;!(Dr Ko)!&lt;, regretting past mistakes but not enough to make changes &gt;!(Kaist and Hanyang)!&lt;, but male lead doesn\u2019t. He was portrayed as being stupid (don\u2019t agree), kind, hard working and persistent from the get go and we get to see him be these things. I would have loved to see some form of growth from his interactions with other characters. He could\u2019ve learned to &gt;!allow his gf see him at his weakest and lean on her!&lt; or maybe even had some intellectual growth. \nLastly, I was so sad that &gt;!Hanyang!&lt; did not get his redemption arc. I was rooting for him and his bae to have a happy life together \ud83d\ude2d. The writer was like &gt;!\u201cf*ck the gay, drug addict! Put him back in jail!\u201d and then gave Jean Valjean, a character that showed very little likelihood of changing his ways, a redemption arc.!&lt;",

            "comment": "Why are carers of people admitted in hospitals often pictured wiping the hands and face of the patient in kdramas? I\u2019m not talking about the wet towel on the head for the fever here. I wonder if this is something commonly done in Korea or if it\u2019s just a trope in dramas. \nThe other thing (I find very difficult to watch)is the focus on eye gunk! It\u2019s either someone pointing out that someone else has dirt in their eyes or even worse, one of the on screen couple wiping the goop off the other\u2019s eyes. Is this meant to be romantic? I was reminded of this when I saw a BTS clipping of Happiness where the female lead wipes the eye gunk off Park Hyung Sik\u2019s eyes and I was beyond grossed out.",

Woke up excited thinking I was gonna add something to my TBW. Devastated when I realized I'd dreamt it all up. \ud83e\udd72 Almost fell to my knees while brushing my teeth lol.",

That seems like something that \"the prince's protector\" would need to know. And also, when San was shot, someone shot an arrow as a distraction to get the Inquisitor (? I forgot what his title is lol) away from the palanquin.!&lt;\n\nBut that aside Dan-Oh and San are so stinkin' cute bro I want what they haveee.",

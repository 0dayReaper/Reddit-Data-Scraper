Finally the trout-on-trout pout is being banished from our screens! The whole rooftop scene was very sweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Emotional resolution within the episode: Thai BL has been doing this for a while now, but it feels like misunderstandings are being resolved in the same episode. When &gt;!Ian has the blind date!&lt; I was fully expecting Gi Tae to leave in a huff and there to be an angst and heartbreak cliffhanger. Instead, we get &gt;!swift resolution, explanation, and Ian immediately taking the piss!&lt; \n\n\n\n\nThis episode again did a great job of showing how Gi Tae is in control of everything and everyone at work, once again bossing the CEO around, leading meetings - but the second he steps outside the building he gives control over to Ian. Decisions, where to go, what to do, even who walks in front - it's a lovely representation of how he's made his own success in his work life, but emotionally he's been following Ian for years and that hasn't changed. \n\n\n\n\nAlso some nice physical representation of work/life separation there - even when they're intertwined he knows how to be a leader to Ian during work hours. \n\n\n\n\nThe way they talk reminds me of [this YouTube short.](https://youtu.be/ri-0bk_6Plw) I always think it's a crime they didn't get a proper series together, but the desire/hesitation and the power dynamic reminds me of Ian/Gi Tae. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe ending is interesting - considering he's just said &gt;!they aren't going to break up even if he leaves the company, why is it a big deal the other place offered him a job? Does it still involve relocating abroad?!&lt; I can't see it happening, but at least this is &gt;!presumably where the angst will come from, not some cheating or misunderstanding garbage!&lt;",

I liked that scene of them on the phone about the date, and I think it exemplifies it well. He totally changed how he asked the same question when Ian mentioned it.",

I'd rather a short KBL with this quality of writing over a longer one that was full of padding and unnecessary angst that makes no sense just to justify the longer episodes.\n\n\n\nBest part of these shows is that they can't afford baggage, just trimmed off the fat so there's just the meat left. It's like poetry - brevity and clarity of language, concise and precise. Focus in on what matters and get the point across.",

He is like, \"You are my man and I am respectfully waiting for you to accept this fact\" \ud83d\ude0d  That rolling around on the floor is the Korean way of showing the consummation of a relationship and I'm glad there was no 'shy virgin' awkwardness between two guys who have been in love with each other for years. And Ki Tae's possessiveness is a pleasure to watch \ud83e\udd70  He's such a good actor \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\n\nSo angst coming up next week with Wan getting a better job offer. I believe it won't really be a big deal. They love each other too much to not be able to work around these teething problems of a new relationship.

Got to thank BLs for introducing and reintroducing me to so many actors and actresses. \n\nGiven how good the overall communication is I hope we don\u2019t get the penultimate episode miscommunication trope. But gosh I need more of their loving moments. Knowing they both liked each other for 7 years it feels fulfilling to see them hug, kiss, and date. Also that kiss was great.\n\nOnly issue I have is I\u2019m curious what happened after they dodged that glacial soccer ball. I\u2019m curious what WAN\u2019s reaction that that\u2019s was. But it\u2019s minor since they established their relationship now.",

I\u2019ve watched a lot of dramas and quite a few BLs and these 2 have some of the smoothest chemistry.  \n\nBeing so short, there isn\u2019t much other than the romance and I want the drama to delve into why Ian ran away back during their youth, but I don\u2019t think it will happen. And I\u2019m okay as long as we get more interactions. \n\nI also liked how casual the conversation about them having possible Ex boyfriends was. I guess it shows my bias but I assumed they would have talked about ex girlfriends still which is possible. \n\nAnyway thanks for the thread. Enjoying the show a lot as my happy time, and I hope it finishes strong.",

Unintentional Love Story is turning out to be good as well. \n\nI'm using Shoulder to Cry On for 'drama with an actor that are kpop idols' both leads are from Omega X. \n\nDating Sim maybe a little more tricky, you could use it for a series 'recommended'",

I have shoulder to cry on under \"idol\" challenge as well, also under the one where one of leads is an athlete.. and any BL fits the last challenge about watching something from previous challenges (last year one of the challenges was drama with LGBTQ character)... there are 3 challenges this year relating to recommendations, so this seems like a last resort. Anyhow, if I end up watching Unintentional love story, I'll now have a legitimate reason to put it under the one recommended by fellow kdc participant \ud83e\udd23\n\nI wonder if Our Dating Sim would count as direct title translation, since English title used the short Sim instead of the full Simulation...",

            "comment": "Idk why people are sleeping on this show ; \\^ ; this deserves so much hype. I've been enjoying this much more than other shows currently airing and I'm watching a lot (K, J and C dramas).\n\nThe acting is so good, very natural and not cringe af as with the other BLs or short dramas that I've seen lol. The plotting and direction is as good as it gets with their short runtime so kudos to the team.\n\nMost BLs these days try to pander too much to what's popular and feels inauthentic. Also the acting is either okay, a miss or a bigger miss xD. I couldn't get into Unintentional Love Story. . . it feels weird, the characterization is not working for me and the overall direction + acting is not gelling even though I really want to watch it. Put Your Heads on my Shoulder, I'm also following along but I'm beginning to get reluctant, I didn't like how it started lol, the bullying was not cute for me but I want to support the leads so I'm keeping on as I'm not as put off as with Unintentional Love Story.\n\nSemantic Error made it big but I'm liking this show more. It's more detailed as for what they can work with in terms of time and the acting is better.\n\nAfter the latest episode I re-watched from episode 1 again and felt compelled to write this xD.\n\nFor those who want a fix to their BL cravings while waiting for future episodes, try **30-sai made Dotei Da to Mahotsukai ni Nareru rashii (2020)**. It's a J-Dorama tho but I found it cute given it's ridiculous premise. The lack of kiss scenes which made it more wholesome for me and actually fits the tone of the show so I was fine with it. Although I didn't like the 2nd couple, idk why everyone has to be gay in a gay story, dafuq is up with that, it felt way too forced so I skipped the subplot for the 2nd couple.",

It ruined everything All the Liquors had established big let down. \n\nKBL\u2019s are still hit and miss unfortunately, I would argue the JBL\u2019s are ahead of the game although they seem to either be tooth rotting fluff or emotional devastation. Old Fashioned Cupcake is my favourite \ud83e\udd70",

At the recent stage the very good Kdramas often outclass western shows in terms of production value and acting. I feel like an average Korean actor or even a supporting character can out outclass every other industry's actor sans the uber A-list hollywood ones who are a class on their own.",

    "postText": "Thank you for all the nominations. I needed some extra time since I was busy and also to verify that the song submitted is eligible. I have removed some songs that were for dramas before 2020 and also that were released in 2023. For a few songs that were submitted, I found that they were not on the official OST even if they have appeared on the show so I have also removed them.\n\nWith that, we have 171 songs submitted. The songs have been broken up into 5 groups. For each group, you can vote for as many songs that you like. I have included the YouTube/Spotify link for each song so do take a listen before you submit your votes. I have found some songs that I like the previous time we held it for the 2010s songs. So don't just go for the songs you know and you might discover some gems.\n\nEach group will be up for about 2 days. Your votes will determine the final seeds. Only the Top 128 will move on the proper bracket. \n\nHead [here](https://animebracket.com/favourite-kdrama-ost-song-of-2020-2021-2022/vote) to view the group and submit your votes!\n\nDo feel free to give your comments about the songs in the group as well as predictions for what might take up the high seeds.",

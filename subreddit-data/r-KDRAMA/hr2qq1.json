I think you will enjoy it. I love the first half, since the showcase of NK life is refreshing to me and made me realize I had been guilty of seeing the North Korean people more as victims of oppressive regime rather than actual human beings with rich culture. After that it is your typically rom com with predictable plot. It is not my top show overall but definitely has high rewatching values.",

There is a charm in the style of comedy, even if you aren't Korean and some jokes go over your head. The romance wasn't my favourite thing about the show but there is chemistry. The characters are all very loveable though. \n\nPersonally I'd give it an 8/10 based on how much I've enjoyed watching it, which is great in my book. This whole subreddit raves about it, I'm sure many would give it a 10/10.",

I got choked up when she remembered some of the good moments that she shared with Kang Ho and it\u2019s clear that she loves him so much. However I hate that she defaults to depriving him of food in order to motivate him. It was abusive when he was a child and it\u2019s abusive now when he\u2019s a vulnerable adult who is reliant on her for his basic needs.\n\nI\u2019m confused as to what the drama is trying to say, particularly &gt;! When he did manage to feed himself. It felt like they wanted it to be a great moment of personal triumph potentially to justify her means. It read to me as an act of desperation alongside the personal triumph and if I were aware of a situation like that in reality, I would be contacting whatever form of social services I could. It does appear that the resources to help him have been thin on the ground and caretaking is hard. !&lt; \n\nI am really enjoying the show in general and I hope as Kang Ho regains some skills and independence it\u2019s less of an issue going forwards.",

Physical therapy is difficult, doubly so if you're dealing with someone with Kang Ho's mental ability. I wouldn't pile this together with her abusive acts when he was a child.\n\nThis is just her using whatever teaching techniques she picked up from raising pigs to use to get him to do it. You can also tell Kang Ho doesn't view it in the same light as the abuse he faced because he doesn't have the responses we saw when he was a kid. That is to say, he remains jovial despite it. We also see in the preview that most of his mobile skills return in the next episode and she'll allow him to go outside and \"be a kid\". The other thing you have to remember is that people don't suddenly change their pattern of behaviour overnight, even if she faced that epiphany when he refused to eat. It's more realistic that she's changing progressively and still retains some of her \"bad\" ways for now.",

There were several meals where he literally could not eat, a basic human need to survive. He\u2019s also an extremely vulnerable person who is dependent on her for all his needs so joviality in that situation could be lifesaving. !&lt; He was motivated by the toy and could make progress by other means as he\u2019s a determined character.",

Besides, as you said, the mother didn't have any outside support.\n\nSeriously, in this particular case, I do not blame her at all.\n\nShe knows that what she is doing is wrong, but she is ready to go through in order to give her son some kind of future. She even asks permission to be a \"bad mother for a little longer\".\n\nI seriously don't see how you can pile it in the childhood abuse, which was both cruel and needless.",

As he grew up she went from dominating to subservient because as an adult and this badass prosecutor he had grown cold and didn\u2019t need her anymore so in her mind she thinks that was a small price to pay for how she wanted him to turn out. She\u2019s simultaneously self-aware and not of the gravity of her parenting approach and actions, and that scene you describe as potentially coming across as a moment of personal triumph I think was framed really well because from JYS\u2019 perspective she counts it as a win based on her methods but from an audience and Kang Ho perspective it almost feels so uncomfortable because she sacrificed his dignity in exchange for her hokey method of rehab. I think it\u2019s that juxtaposition that they\u2019re trying to highlight rather than a clear black or white.",

No matter how much she changes in the future, I won't forgive her.!&lt;\n\nIt's really difficult not to empathize with JYS because of Ra Mi-Ran. She's really talented and I felt her emotions throughout the episode. Whenever she cries her heart out, I also feel like crying. \n\nLee Do-Hyun was also exceptional. He's truly one of the best actors out there. The gravita of his acting is on par with seasoned actors. It was really gutting when the first thing he remembered was what his mother told him about not getting full when eating so that he won't be sleepy. I was also surprised when he randomly shouted to feed him. It was hilarious.\n\nMaybe it's just me but what JYS is doing seems like borderline abusive. I love the parallelism between the piglets and CKH. When the only thing you know is raising pigs, it's hard not to do that to your son too. If she continues to do what she's doing, history will repeat itself and CKH would hate her again. \n\nI love how the community supports JYS. Although they gossip about each other, you can really feel that they love each other. It makes me want to live there too.\n\nI'm pretty sure they would reveal that the father of the kids is CKH. \n\nI hope that Choi Taek's dad is really concerned about CKH. It would make the eventual reveal that he is the son of his victim more heart wrenching.\n\n&gt;!The audacity of that bitch to hug CKH after consciously becoming an accessory to attempted murder in the next episode is second to none. !&lt;How dare she?\n\nI want Lee Do-Hyun to see in a rom-com next time. He always plays the tragic character. I want to be swooned by him in his future projects.",

The way he said it was truly with the voice of a child who's sad but doesn't understand how heart-breaking their words are. Even the way he cried felt more like he was crying because his mom was crying, rather than him understanding her reason for crying.!&lt;\n\nDoes anyone understand what I'm trying to say lmao\n\n&gt;!I never expected the fiance\u00e9 to be in on it!! Though I like that they show that she's not walked away from it completely unfazed. I'm really curious as to why she did it though. So messed up of her dad to go up to her in the hospital and whisper \"you did well\". It kind of felt like maybe she had been more receptive to the plan before actually executing it, hence his comment??!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Kangho's mom taking away his food because he couldn't move by himself felt kinda cruel. I mean, I understand her reasoning that he might not improve as quickly because he'd rely on her and that time was of essence for his bones not to stiffen. But, taking away his food just because he didn't succeed at once was... very reminiscent of his upbrining. She gives punishments rather than rewards.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Although I do think she was truly desperate for him to improve and perhaps saw it as a necessary evil? But that reasoning was probably also applied during his upbrining...!&lt;\n\nEdit:\n\nEp 4:\n\nLMAO I loved the first scene with all the villagers together. The kids are so funny, &gt;!\"You said you were seven!\" \"I AM, the doctor said I am seven!\" \ud83d\ude02!&lt;\n\nLaughed so much when &gt;!Kangho's mom was scolding the three kids, and Kangho said \"and is it okay to use the rubber tube as a hula hoop?\" and they panned to the village chief \ud83d\ude02!&lt;",

This show has been great.\n\nMy prediction for next episodes is that Mijoo and Choi Kang didn't actually end on good terms, based on her facial reaction. Its either that or shes suprised to see him. As I was watching, I was under the assumption that he was playing the long game, and that he told Mijoo to stay away in order to protect her while he went after the chairman. Because we saw how lovey dovey they seemed in ep 4. Maybe thats why she seemed suprised, because she expected him to be trying to trick the chairman.\n\nOne thing I didn't like is how the mom is using food as a way to get him to work on his pt. It was nice that she recognized that she hasn't been a great mom to him. But I mean cmon, youre kinda doing the exact same thing again by telling him he cant eat if he doesnt move. I doubt starving him is the most efficient way of doing things.\n\nThe kids though, are def his. I really hope so anyways. I can't wait for the reveal if it is true.",

Ha-young\u2019s &gt;!involvement in the accident!&lt; is a characteristic twist in the tail of a Shim Na-yeon drama. It\u2019s ultimately credited to the screenwriter, but the director has a distinctive way of visually executing these twists.\n\n- I find Mi-joo as portrayed by Ahn Eun-jin to be an immensely likable character. The fact that I\u2019m rooting for her and Kang-ho despite the two of them having shared very little screen time to this point is telling. \n\n- The village head\u2019s reaction to the eel in the rice bowl was comedy gold.\n\n- \u201cYou get sleepy when you\u2019re full. And if you get sleepy, you won\u2019t be able to study.\u201d Fantastic acting by the leads in that scene, fantastic storytelling and fantastic direction. The familial bonds can be palpably felt in this drama.\n\n- I\u2019m impressed by how painstakingly the drama depicts Kang-ho\u2019s physical rehabilitation. The emotional rehabilitation, however, will be an even longer journey.",

As if a Kdrama would have the guts make its lead protagonists that much of a villain ha! But even setting the meta aside, there were numerous clues pointing to him playing the two men he's targeted. The first I noticed his the car and home he actually drives and lives in matching his current status as a prosecutor, when supposedly his *father* has bought him a house and a car. He used that car though when he's with his fake girlfriend \n\nSpeaking of, he very obviously targeted the Assemblyman. It is not a coincidence that he and the Chief Buffoon are connected and are part of his happy family scheme\n\nFinally I love **Mijo**! The cheering outside the University entrance was my favorite sequence in the first episode. The way **Kang Ho** was looking at her when she was breaking down that she's ruined his mother's carefully laid plans for him and that wistful kiss. Ugh! I felt the love. The boy has a lot to hate his mother for and the inability to keep people like **Mijo** in his life, is top of the list\n\nAnd oh, the twins belong to one of her wayward older sisters.

Many doctors expected him to die, so even him being alive was a miracle (He was 6 at that time and got treated because of cancer). When he was nearly cured, it was clear for the docs that he couldn\u2019t walk anymore, because parts of his brain were dead (don\u2019t know how to explain it in english lol, sry if it\u2019s not accurate). But my stubborn aunt made my cousin clear that she won\u2019t let him enter their home with a wheelchair. So after months of trying REALLY hard, he rly was able to walk. The docs said that the brain was able to make things like bridges to connect parts which before lost the connection because of it dying partly. But yeah, they said he would die, later that he won\u2019t be able to walk anymore, but know he is a 12 year old child who loves to play basketball. Because I saw them, I can\u2019t get tooo much angry with the mum in this series. Cause I kinda saw it happening with my own eyes \ud83e\udee3",

The montage showcasing Kangho and Mijoo's relationship was absolutely adorable and heartwarming. Kangho and the kids were hilarious, and the child actors were incredibly talented. And the scene where the sheet mask lady attempted to bathe Kangho cracked me up.\n\nWhat I appreciate about this drama is that it doesn't keep the audience in the dark for too long. They revealed everything quickly, such as the fact that the accident was planned, and the villains knew about Kangho's father. It seems like we will find out who the twin's father is in the next episode. The unpredictability of the plot is refreshing, and I'm loving it.\n\nIt was heart-wrenching to see how shocked Kangho's mother was about his corruption. However, I think she has finally come to terms with herself and realized that she was a bad mother. Now they fell hard and saw the other side. This is a chance for her to be a good mother this time around.\n\nThe fact that Kangho still have laws knowledge somewhere in his brain made me think it won\u2019t take long until he\u2019s back to his former self. I feel Lee Dohyun will show us more amazing acting when his two personalities clash and the revenge is served.",

But in the meantime, he's being given a run for his money by the twins. Ki So-yu (Ye-jin) is a remarkably self-assured young actress.\n* That quirky tour of the village was a delight, punctuated with Kang-ho and Mi-joo being reunited in the present day at last.",

They're such good actors. I love the scene where JYS lost it when she found out that CKH accepted bribes. It's an eye-opener for her. JYS thought she was pushing CKH to greater heights but it resulted in creating a cold-blooded monster. However, I don't believe for a second that CKH is a cold-blooded monster. He may seem aloof but I think it's part of his long-term revenge plan. He's smart. I'm pretty sure he did everything to achieve his goal to take down the villains. \n\n&gt;!I'm sure CKH got LMJ pregnant. They cohabited together when he was taking the examinations. It's impossible they didn't fool around. Maybe that's why LMJ hates CKH right now. But I think they went separate ways without CKH knowing that LMJ was pregnant. !&lt;\n\n**The face mask lady steals every scene she's in**. She's freaking hilarious. I love her so much. I can't wait to know her backstory. \n\nLee Do-Hyun continues to give a great performance. His acting is so believable. I really want to see him in a rom-com though. \n\n&gt;!I'm pretty sure all the incriminating evidence was in that secret room.!&lt; Thank God JYS took everything. I hope it stays safe until the villains are taken down.\n\n&gt;!Will there be a love interest for JYS? The man who bumped into her car appeared twice and already met CKH. I'm guessing he will be the second husband. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!I guess his memory is starting to come back. We get glimpses of his prosecutor persona every now and then.!&lt; I can't wait for his memories to come back and for him to take down the villains.\n\nWhy didn't anyone want to bathe CKH? **I freaking volunteer.** I'll scrub off the dirt from every inch of his body. *(Sorry for being thirsty.)*\n\nI like the symbolism with the *almost* dead plant. It mirrors the situation of the family. JYS is nurturing both the plant and her son back to health. \n\nI also like that the monologue from Episode 1 about the pigs wanting to see the sky is repeated in this episode.\n\nAnyway, I can't wait to see how LMJ would react in finding out what happened to CKH. \n\nP.S. Is this a [reference](https://imgur.com/a/iorQ5jw) to Lee Do-Hyun's character from The Glory?",

I see now that the show is meant to showcase what people do when given a second chance and I suppose they\u2019re trying to show &gt;!that this time around she just wants him to be able to live and walk again!&lt; but her tenacity as a woman and mother really manifests itself in deeply problematic ways. \n\nLDH is so fantastic\u2026truly impressed by him. It\u2019s easy to ham in a character such as this but he shows just the right amount of restraint. \n\nI also just want to shout out the men of the village. They honestly serve as much better friends than her actual friends. They don\u2019t underestimate her and are supportive in the best way. I suspect the women carry their burdens and dynamics and insecurities and Young-Soon has certainly not endeared herself to them so they\u2019re less inclined to be kind to her and understandably so. Having said that it\u2019s clear that they\u2019ll all always be there for her. I hope some day she comes to truly acknowledge that. \n\nI feel so completely terrible for Mi-Joo. How completely awful &gt;!to be backstabbed like that!&lt;. It always breaks my heart when the universe makes life a lot harder than it needs to be for some people. \n\nIt was quite obvious that the fianc\u00e9 &gt;!was in on the whole thing because of the convenient timing and the insistence to drive\u2026!&lt; (ain\u2019t no KDrama FL or SFL ever offered to drive like that unless it was a boss-Secretary relationship \ud83d\ude44). And ofcourse not shocking that she\u2019s now suffering &gt;!from PTSD as well!&lt;. The show could easily have been named 365 ways to mentally and physically harm your progeny (on a serious note I can see now why the English title of the show is what it is). \n\nAnyway, it will be interesting to see how this all unfolds. I hope at some point they\u2019re shown to receive the therapy and counselling they all so badly deserve and need. \ud83d\ude14\n\nETA: Oh also this show would benefit greatly from a better editor. I can see what they\u2019re trying to do with the story telling but it ends up feeling very abrupt.",

She\u2019s not a healthcare professional, she\u2019s running out of options and time and she has a stubborn adult son who has the mind of a 7 year old. I\u2019m not condoning her actions of starving him, but even she realises that she\u2019s being a bad mother again by saying \u201cplease give me permission to be a bad mother for just a while longer\u201d. Im sure that she does feed him or else he won\u2019t be alive after all that time anyway.\n\nI\u2019m guessing that the drama is going to show her gradual character redemption, which is why I\u2019m glad they chose Ra Mi Ran for the role. If it were any other actress, I don\u2019t think JYS would be portrayed as sympathetic yet cruel at the same time.",

She has no idea what his hobbies are, he has no friends and romance because of her. He couldn\u2019t even watch TV. Wanting him to be happy is a convenient lie she told herself to make her feel better about abusing him. \n\nI\u2019m just so mad.

Also if you cut ties with your abusive parent, you\u2019re \u201cimpudent\u201d as all the other villagers keep calling him. \n\nHis mother loves him. But she never took the time to learn what he wanted. She never gave him autonomy in ANYTHING. Not even in nourishment. She never taught him to be independent. The only thing she taught him was to study like hell at the expense of his health. He even fought back and TOLD her explicitly that what he\u2019s doing will push him to become the corrupt prosecutor that killed his father.\n\nEdit: &gt;!

I\u2019m actually loving how much the show is pushing the audience to get comfortable with the fact that we\u2019re going to be uncomfortable about the mother-son protagonists, who they were, who they are and who they might become. \n\nEvery dialogue, particularly between JYS and CKH is so deliberate and the editing in this episode really made for the back and forth storytelling to be more compelling than it has been so far. \n\nKudos to LDH and AEJ to so quickly build the type of chemistry and dynamic that has you rooting for them from the get go. That first &gt;!wistful kiss!&lt; in episode 1 really set the tone and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re in for more heartbreak as more layers of their past get peeled away but so far it feels like the show is trying to take you on this complete journey.  \n\nI\u2019m kind of glad this is a 14 episode show because that means hopefully the writing will be crisper without getting preachy either way. \n\nIt was very obvious that the main bad guy &gt;!was wildly aware of who Kang Ho is, and same with the assemblyman!&lt;, but what\u2019s going to get interesting is to see how smart and cunning Kang Ho really was in taking on what he did. \n\nLDH is so bloody charismatic you just want to root for him irrespective!\n\nAlso, the kids are incredibly cute and I love the dynamic the 3 of them share. This reset to being a 7 year old really is showcasing how much people can be an outcome of their circumstances and how the same challenges can manifest themselves differently in different people even if they were sweet children to begin with. \n\nAhhhh it\u2019s gonna be so hard waiting a whole week to see the next chapter unfold!",

But when she started crying after Kang Ho kept repeating the sentence she always said to him about getting full, she gained a little bit of my sympathy. When she started starving him again though? My sympathy for her when right back to where it started. I also hate how they put her starving her paralysed amnesia-having son in a little montage with fun background music like what she's doing isn't horrific?? Almost like we're supposed to laugh when he almost gets there but she still takes his food away, like \"Oh silly Kang Ho, he almost got it \ud83d\ude02\" like wtf?? Maybe y'all can forgive/justify that kind of behaviour, but I sure as hell can't. She'll probably do more shit like this throughout the rest of the series but I hope, I know they probably will, but I really hope they don't try and justify all her horrible actions at the end of the series in an \"I did these things because I loved you so much\" type manner. And if i see this drama start to seem like it'll end with all being forgiven, I'll probably stop watching. TBH I throughly enjoyed him handing her the adoption papers in such a cold manner, that's still my favorite moment so far.",

Like acts like a 7 year old. Or is he aware that he's an adult, but his memory has basically been reset to that. So, he is a bit child-like and innocent (because he no longer has the memory of the experiences that hardened him), but he's still fundamentally like.. an adult. I ask because I want romance, but it'll be weird lol!&lt;",

Typically in cases like these, you still have memories of adulthood but they're difficult to recall, or you might remember only portions of them. It's unlikely that someone with retrograde amnesia would act like a child and completely forget their adult life. Instead, they may exhibit some child-like behaviors and tendencies due to their incomplete memories and confusion about their current situation which is what we see with Kang Ho. You can even see him being more mature than his 7-year-old self at some points, which although might be due to Lee Dohyun being an adult, also works with the diagnosis. \n\nAnother important thing to note is that he'll likely still retain all of his \"adult\" desires, because while the brain may be recovering, biologically he's already in adulthood, meaning his desire for sex, intimacy, love, etc. will remain.",

And if they wanted to do like a reconciliation between him and his mother (as well as his past wrongdoings), they could\u2019ve done so without the memory loss that takes him back to age literal 7\ud83d\ude2d \n\nHe doesn\u2019t even remember what he did\u2026imagine if he could remember and then he\u2019d have to feel guilty about it while he\u2019s disabled for the time being. (In reference to the scene where his mom is crying and hitting him, wondering why he lived like that) It\u2019s kind of lame for him to just regain his memory, THEN change, which he will since they\u2019re setting it up that way. \n\nDon\u2019t even get me started on that rich girl being involved with his accident. \n\n\nAnyway it would\u2019ve been interesting to see him still have his memory, his mom would have to take care of him even though he \u201chates\u201d her, and they eventually find common ground or he starts to somewhat forgive her. And because of his new perspective and acceptance he can try to right his wrongs as a prosecutor, as well as whatever happened with mijoo. (for now I\u2019m assuming he didn\u2019t know about the pregnancy, and broke up with her to go further in his career, or she encouraged him to do it idk)",

I liked how the writer reiterated the life and hardship of pigs and how both mother and son are essentially needing a reset of their world and perceptives I.e pigs falling over and looking at the sky. The cast making up the villagers are super spot on in their comedic deliveries too. I'm curious as to whether mask lady has her mask removed during the end of the series",

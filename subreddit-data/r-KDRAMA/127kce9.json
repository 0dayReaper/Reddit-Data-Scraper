            "comment": "Some info on the actual legal system/lawyers of the Joseon era to set the scene:\n\nThere was a three tiered legal system: civil cases and low level criminal cases were dealt with by the county magistrate, the provincial governor handled appeals and more serious criminal cases, and the Ministry of Justice presided over the court of final appeal and criminal cases punishable by death. A case could also be brought directly to the king through \u4e0a\u8a00/sangeon (written appeal) or \u64ca\u931a/gyeokjaeng (literally banging a gong and shouting out your plea as the king passed by). \n\nLitigants were expected to present their cases personally. The upper classes were more likely to be familiar with the process or be able to afford one of the many published legal codices. But the lower classes were often advised by a \u5916\u77e5\u90e8/oejibu, which was a mix between clerk and lawyer. It wasn't an officially recognized or licensed profession, and was actually illegal (punishable by banishment) during certain periods in Joseon when the government attempted to crack down on nuisance civil suits. \n\n[Source](https://s-space.snu.ac.kr/bitstream/10371/91462/1/05_JKL%2013-1%20Jung%20Geung%20Sik.pdf)!",

I'd say it's half comedy half serious stuff. Curious to see if this tone will continue throughout the series.\n\nKang Han Soo, what a scumbag! But also very likeable. I am happy to see WDH playing someone a little bit more cheerful. It's like watching a scummy Jo Eun Seob of the Joseon era.",

He is everything. \n\nThe first episode was quick paced and visually pleasing.  The real standouts to me (actors who had the perfect balance of comedy and drama) are Woo Do Hwan (the man would shine even if he wore a potato sack and read my distant cousin's annual  boring Christmas letter aloud), and the always excellent Cho Hee Bong (I really hope we see a lot more of him). \n\nI love that the mule is a featured character, and hope to see more of him/her, too!",

It's a nice progression too - like the lower down \"followers\" are easy to \"knock off\". And the big battles will start once he starts reaching the impenetrable upper echelon of power.  That they don't linger and sit on info or characters is super refreshing and hopefully a really good sign of them always finding fresh turns and avenues for the continuation of the plot. This got very tiring for me with Our Blooming Youth - they sat on the same information and on the same emotional state of the main characters for like 14 episodes instead of continuing to develop either the plotline or the relevant characters.   \n\n\nI'm delighted by how many different character strings we have gong on\n\n\\- the son who was undercover who we get the sense is a little at odds with his dad\n\n\\- the politically impotent king plotline \n\n\\- of course the revenge plotline   \n\\- the princess figuring herself and her bigger goals out \n\n  \nI also was pretty impressed by how quickly they managed to progress the internal dynamics between the leads. I think sometimes drama's like to sit on the bickering couple trope for too long - but I was impressed that they have these characters sliding through SO MANY different types of interactions with each other already. And I adore how they've already landed on a foundation of \"we get along but....\" ;) \n\nI feel like this pilot did a really good job of not boxing in a character and how they relate to the characters around them. All is game all the time. That's fun. :)",

Glad there's not too much of a focus on the usual annoying corrupt politics and forbidden love shit. I hope it continues more like a classical courtroom law drama but in Joseon, multiple smaller cases while slowly building up the final showdown. As long as it continues being about law (and romance coz their chemistry is exhilarating) and not politics I'm gonna enjoy it very much.",

            "comment": "&gt;\"Joseon Attorney\" tells the story of an oejibu (attorney in Joseon Dynasty) \n\n**Portrayals of \"waeji bu\" (oejibu) in K-historical dramas:**\n\n**(1)** The whole premise of the blockbuster 2016 historical drama \"The Flower in Prison\" is that the MC (played Jin Se-yeon) becomes a \"waeji bu,\" specifically in Eps. &gt;!35-36!&lt; and later.\n\nFrom [\"Go Soo, Jin Se-yeon for MBC sageuk Flower in\u2002Prison\"](https://www.dramabeans.com/2015/11/go-soo-jin-se-yeon-for-mbc-sageuk-flower-in-prison/) (Dramabeans):\n&gt;\n&gt;The drama will deal with the Joseon legal system, in particular the people who argued on behalf of wronged citizens. They weren\u2019t government officials who handled lawsuits, but would help ordinary people interpret the law and handle lawsuits for them, in a time when the legal code was written solely in hanja and thus out of the reach of understanding for commoners. In essence, it was a precursor to the modern legal system, with lawyers serving as intermediaries between the people and the courts.\n\nPlease read my discussion titled **\"The Flower in Prison\": historical backgrounders for those who have not yet seen this drama** at https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/hnxlui/the_flower_in_prison_historical_backgrounders_for/\n\n**(2)** In Episode 60 of \"Dong Yi,\" &gt;!Dong Yi leaves the palace after her son is adopted by the Queen.!&lt; She turns her private residence as a welfare center for the poor folks in the city. To the exasperation of the local officials, she becomes a \"waeji bu\" in helping poor defendants.\n\nAt around the 12:19 mark of Ep. 60 at https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bGdHiHVBFPk if you listen closely to the Korean dialogue, you can hear &gt;!Dong Yi!&lt; say the word \"waeji bu.\" [I don't read Korean, but the  subtitles seem to say something about the \"waeji bu.\"](https://imgur.com/mnHAvWN)\n\n**(3)** In Eps. 67-68 of \"Yi San\" aka \"Lee San, Wind of the Palace,\" Jeong Yak-yong (Dasan) is a Sungkyungkwan scholar who\u2019s frequently cutting classes. But later on, he becomes &gt;!Yi San\u2019s favorite official and the architect of Hwaseong Fortress.!&lt; Before he met Yi San, Dasan helped poor defendants with their legal cases for free. So he probably was also a \"waeji bu.'\n\nIf I remember correctly, in history, the \"waeji bu\" were banned from participating in the Joseon Dynasty's legal system after they became unruly and disrupted the legal proceedings. In \"The Flower in Prison,\" the MC and her friends revived the \"waeji bu\" to help the oppressed people in the capital. \n\n**B. Notes about the Joseon Dynasty's justice system:**\n\n**(1)** From [website of Korea\u2019s Supreme Court](https://eng.scourt.go.kr/eng/judiciary/history/history.jsp):\n&gt;\n&gt;Joseon had an even more sophisticated system, in which petty civil and criminal cases were handled by local heads of administration, while the governor of each province took care of the appellate cases in addition to the first instance trials of serious criminal cases. Royal secret investigators sometimes took charge of local trials, serving as a sort of irregular circuit court. Citizens who lost an appellate case against a governor were able to appeal to the central government\u2019s Ministry of Justice. The ministry handled civil and criminal trials in addition to general legal affairs, while acting as the final appeals court run on an agreement basis. Further, various government agencies carried out judicial functions: Saheonbu rectified false charges; Hanseongbu, the city government of Seoul, took charge of trials relating to family or real estate registration; and Euigeumbu handled crimes of the royal family members or treason.\n\n**(2)** From \"Notes On The Development Of Korean Law\" by Michal Tom\u00e1\u0161ek\n&gt;\n&gt;The Korean legal order of the Joseon period was elaborated on to great perfection in the sphere of criminal procedure. Criminal proceeding was governed by the principle of inquisition. The judge \u2013 the inquirer \u2013 centralized in his hand all procedural acts, and he himself collected all material pointing to conviction, but also to the defence of the accused, and he alone also made the decision in the matter. The accused was the passive party of the trial and his rights were very limited. The Korean judicial trial did not, in principle, have the form of a suit as is the modern accusatorial process, where the plaintiff is master of the suit (dominus litis).\n&gt;\n&gt;The main goal of the process before the court at the time was not to prove the guilt of the accused, which was presumed, but rather to obtain his confession.\n&gt;\n&gt;The court was supposed to obtain a confession above all with the aid of proof; if the means of proof did not suffice, even persuasive means of physical force were permitted. The degree of using physical force in obtaining a confession was mostly given by law or judicial precedent, but in practice it often depended on the volition of the court official.",

I think with improbable lady plot lines (ok princess - inn maid \u2026) the only way to pull it off in a sageuk is to rip into the preposterousness and comedy of it. Which they are doing. It\u2019s a nice self aware check. But they\u2019re doing so with heart and character all the same. \n\nWDH!!?!?! This is such a wonderful goof role for him!!!!! I just adore watching him play around with every friggin line! \n\nI can\u2019t remember the last time a chemistry between two leads made me this giddy. But they\u2019re dynamic is SO GREAT. I love the set up. Their dynamic is fast paced- but it all makes sense and it\u2019s fun to see it already *progressing*. From ambivalence, to butting heads, to \u201cfirst times\u201d, to curiosity and admiration, to just liking each other. They have so much energy. \n\n\n- - \nWhat was the purpose for the drinking diversion? I didn\u2019t quite get it. It was cute that she was in her own way trying to do him a solid but it was unnecessarily, wasn\u2019t it? If WDH\u2019s plan was always to get Jo to turn by offering him the opportunity to become next big merchant - he had a pretty solid plan for how to overcome Jo\u2019s suspicions ? \n\n- \n\nI thought this was some SOLID pilot work.

I hope the writing continues to be smart even as the hijinks are silly :)\n\nAs for the drinking diversion, I thought it was just Yeon Joo's way of not making it obvious that she was totally breaking her promise to Jang's henchman that she would divert Han Su. So saving her own skin in a way while also tipping Han Su off? But at the end of the day yes it was quite contrived lol. Especially because Yeon Joo could have just left to start with. But I suppose they wanted to establish character and I'm glad enough to ignore the plot awkwardness for fun's sake.",

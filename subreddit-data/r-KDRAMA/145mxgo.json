Have you been mesmerized by all the Korean food onscreen? Have you succumbed to the allure of the PPL? This post is to share with others what have you done this past month because of watching Kdramas and see who else is like you!\n\nShare things like:\n\n* Hours of sleep lost because you got [caught up in a binge!](https://giphy.com/gifs/mother-of-mine-kGiztx4M3fkVlfkQdz)\n\n* Korean food you ate or cooked -- advice about ramyeon flavors or soju is also welcome!\n\n* [A new hobby](https://i.redd.it/k7k3fwfs40e41.gif) you've picked up or a rediscovery of an old hobby you loved!\n\n* [The gorgeous coat](https://i.redd.it/sdx50o1gpgg31.gif) you bought despite living in a place without winter and other fashion choices!\n\n* Updates about your progress with learning Korean -- whether you are studying formally or just acquiring some basic knowledge through too many Kdramas watched!\n\n* Your new Dyson hairdryer or vacuum and other PPL inspired purchases -- Subway counts too!\n\n* Travel plans and anything else that comes to mind when you think of the phrase \"Kdramas Made Me Do It\"!\n\nShare only as much or as little as you are comfortable with, just remember to be respectful of others and their choices.

So let me try to recall...\n\nI try Korean instant noodles (ramyeon). The first one I tried was the world famous Shin ramyeon (\u8f9b\ub77c\u9eb5). \n\nI learnt reading and writing Hangul (Korean script) by myself, starting from playing around with the Korean input in Microsoft Windows by attempting to make Chinese characters (Hanja) out of Hangul, and looking up for Hangul for each Hanja. (because I am ethnic Chinese and I know Chinese language) However I still do not know the order of the letters, and I still haven't get to learn the Korean language \ud83d\ude48\n\nFor some unknown reason I discovered Korean chess (janggi) and play in my phone. Back then I have never seen janggi ever played in any Korean film until I saw it in *My Love from the Star*! \n\nI bought a big bottle of Sikhye by Paldo, quite some time after seeing a bowl of homemade sikhye in *Extraordinary Attorney Woo*. \n\nI play baduk (more commonly known by its Japanese name \"go\") on my phone (BadukPop) because of *The Glory*. \n\nI tried tteokbokki because of *The Glory* - where there was a scene where Moon Dong-eun ate tteokbokki with Son Myeong-O.\n\nI've recently tried on a hanbok (Korean traditional wear) during a KStreet Carnival over here.",

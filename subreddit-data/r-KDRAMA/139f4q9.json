It\u2019s lighter and more campy.. not that I mind it.. I\u2019d rather have this than them going all dark and eerie..\n\nEdit: EP 2 was even funnier than EP 1. The humour really is on point this season. I absolutely love the set of 1938. It\u2019s so pretty. I also love the styling, such fashionistas for the time. \n\nYou know I always found Kim Bum hot but my gosh, this hairstyle and that look makes him drool worthy! I had butterflies in my stomach &gt;!when she was putting on his tie. I reckon she\u2019s the girl for him this season..!&lt;\n\nAlso, that Shinju Yeon &gt;!reunion was so freaking cute! Singing the same song was seriously the best way for them to meet again.!&lt; \n\nSo far, this season is everything S1 wasn\u2019t and I\u2019m so happy they gave us S2.",

With that being said, this drama is really funny and I have high hopes for it!\n\nEpisode 1&amp;2 thoughts : &gt;!I'm so happy that Shinju reunited with the fox brothers, their relationship is so cute. I didn't think I'd like the new female lead (Hong-Ju) but her character is hilarious and strong female leads in kdramas tend to be rare. Also, looking forward to seeing the other mountain god at work (Mu-Young, the one with the fire abilities) I really love the korean folklore aspect to this drama.!&lt;",

Its just convenient hand waving by the writers, and I hate it.  \n\nDoes this mean that Lee Rang will forget everything after Lee Yeon goes back? Also, do all the demons that Lee Yeon kills &gt;!like the turtle in Ep 1!&lt; aren't actually dead - since he can't change anything. Or does time reset after he leaves?\n\nI'm prob thinking about this more than the writers did.",

I also want to see Shinjoo and Rang bond again - to Shinjoo, Rang became part of his family with Yuri and Soo-oh whilst to the Rang of 1938 Shinjoo is nothing more then Yeon's friend - I hope we see some more bonding between them as well. Yeon and Shinjoo need a conversation about what to do about/say to Rang given they've been told the future won't change, how much will they decide to reveal to him?!&lt;\n\nAlso I'm kind of confused about Yuri &gt;!is she the same Yuri as the present day but in 1938?

If FL's have no flaws they are hated, but if they DO have normal human flaws or are a little weird they are also hated by people xD.

Bullets, normal swords, normal poison are examples of human attacks. The red-white mask is obviously also a mythical creature, so his sword is not a normal sword, so he can actually hurt other mythical creatures with it, just like Lee Yeon's sword that he pulls out of nowhere.",

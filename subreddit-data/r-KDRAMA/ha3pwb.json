I rarely watched K drama, and not into K pop song but this show is kinda nice once in a while.\nAlso, I have a weird attraction to a person who feel weird or out of place, not understanding human behavior or something like that. Example, the Goblin and Grim Reaper(their interaction and relationship), Castiel and Soulless Sam in Supernatural, Kyle XY earlier episode etc. (Its usually the guy, havent really find many female character like so, other than Parker in Leverage, Luna Lovegood in HarryPotter)",

Drama: **The killer's shopping list**.\n\nThe Choco pie ppl in the mentioned drama was the best connected ppl to the central plot I have seen so far.",

So I was able to resist...until I couldn't. I was looking for a product with specific requirements and the dang thing checked all the boxes. I love the smell a lot! It's not super greasy but not long lasting either. I will probably buy it again...dang it. Now I am even more irritated.",

I haven\u2019t seen them as much as I did in 2021/2022 kdramas. Honorable mention to Yumi\u2019s bed in Yumi\u2019s Cells that made me fall in love with this type of furniture",

Silly question, but is this the regular way people drink water?  (Is this a thing?)",

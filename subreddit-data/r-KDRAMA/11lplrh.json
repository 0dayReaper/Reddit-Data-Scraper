Edit: just 2 hours till I get home \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\n\nEp. 3: &gt;!It took only one accidental barely-a-kiss, but bro completely fell head over heals for a ghost T-T!&lt; imma be real, I don't feel any chemistry between them, but &gt;!that montage where he saves her from whatever that purgatory like place was... that really cool music... and the way she wakes up cradled in his arms.!&lt; Yeah, that was really romantic, I have to admit.\n\nIt still feels kinda early to have an entire episode dedicated &gt;!to him being jealous!&lt;but ig that's the power of a 12 episode drama. Bring on the ghost noona romance.\n\nEp. 4: this plot is still meh imo and i kinda find the FL annoying &amp; selfish &gt;!(felt so bad to see Youngmin spending so much hard-earned and badly needed money on clothes for ghost)!&lt; but... I really like this drama somehow, like I'm having fun. also jealous Young Min is so cute, I want to see this ML in a romantic drama. preferably one where his crush isn't a ghost or &gt;!where he doesn't die fighting a zombie while being friendzoned!&lt;.\n\nalso the OST is so beautiful",

I've never seen a more tension-filled search for &gt;!an outdated phone charger!&lt; -- it was kind of funny that Yeong Min's search felt more desperate and tense than some chases in thrillers.\n\nI'm digging the chemistry between Yeong Min and Ji Hyeon, it's not electric or sizzling but feels like an undeniable pull between the two. Like they're *friends* but there's always a spark or two that pops up suggesting there's something more.\n\nNow that we've already covered \"breakup\", I'm hoping we get actual romance.\n\nI do wonder how many makjang tropes we'll manage to cover, so far there's been murder and amnesia. Will there be a birth secret?",

I feel it has potential, but the ML isn't very expressive and a little wooden. There is nothing overly exciting or different in the plot either, and there are a couple of little niggles that are personal to me so won't bother calling them out. I'm hoping it will get better as I've been looking forward to this one and i do enjoy a bit of lighthearted supernatural fun. However, I'm coming into this on the back of love to hate you and crash course in romance, so perhaps my expectations are a bit high \ud83d\ude04",

This is the themed post for all identification questions and requests, including dramas! \n\nBefore posting in this thread please take a look through our [discussion resources - who/what/which is this section](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/discussionresources#wiki_who.2Fwhat.2Fwhich_is_this.3F) which outlines ways in which you can work out many of these requests for yourself.\n\nYou can ask here for help identifying the following things: Dramas, Actors, Product  Placement (either product or brand), Drama Locations, Clothing,  Accessories, Music (OST or background).\n\nPlease  provide a picture if possible (upload on imgur) and include as much  contextual information as you know (e.g. source drama, broadcast year, episode number and time stamp, etc.).\n\nOnce you have found an answer please edit your original comment to state \"**SOLVED**\" in bold caps at the top so people don't spend time trying to help unnecessarily.\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;. For more detailed guidance on spoiler tags and when to use them, check our [Spoiler Tags Tutorial](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags).\n\n\n***Just In Case Resources***\n\n[FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and [Netflix FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101/netflix_faqs) **|** [Glossary](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions) **|** [Latest On-Airs](/r/KDRAMA/search?q=flair%3Aon-air&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=week) and [On-Air Roster](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episode_discussion_roster) **|** [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) **|** [Where To Watch *aka* Legal Sites](/r/kdrama/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas) **|** [Everything In Our Wiki *aka* Wiki Homepage](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/index) **|** [Get Recommendations For Your Next Watch](/r/kdramarecommends/comments/hl34w7/rules_resources_and_a_guide_to_navigating/)",

Recently I was trying to look for it so I could watch it because it seemed fun but I don't know the name of the k drama. All I know from the clips I watched was that the protagonist was considered \"fat\" and she had a handsome boyfriend. People were confused as why he was with her. And when they met in high school she was skinny and pretty so she was starting to get insecure about why he likes her because shes not \"pretty\" anymore (I think). But he loves her anyway. (I also think he wasn't considered handsome when he was young). I also remember that she and her friends used to gather in a sort of coffee shop and she liked to eat sweets there. That's all I know about the series. Please help me find it I'm starting to lose it because i looked everywhere! Thanks",

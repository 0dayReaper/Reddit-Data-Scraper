Ep14 is the best and my fave episode so far \ud83d\udd25 It was so satisfying to watch Hajun losing to Doki \u2728\n\nSo excited for the last two episodes but at the same time it will also be the end \ud83e\udd7a\nThat upcoming prison fight of Doki reminds me of how the manga ended. \nI remember that it was also like 1 vs everyone in the underground \ud83d\ude05\n\nI\u2019m hoping that they\u2019ll give us a satisfying ending and they can come back for another season \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\nThis season definitely has a lighter tone because season1 was really intense like every episode \ud83d\ude06\nBut I still love both seasons and I hope they can reach higher ratings \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nExcited for the end and I\u2019ll definitely miss waiting for new episodes Friday and Saturday \ud83e\udd79\ud83d\udda4\n\n\nEdit: Suddenly remembered the first episode! Doki in the prison shirtless with lots of body marks!! which he probably got from that prison fight. Ep1 was the present time and then we went back two yrs ago after that.",

Shin Jae Ha as villain here is way better than his character at CCIR. I hope there is fighting scenese next week between his character and Do Ki.

Ha Joon being TERRIFIED when he found out Dong Ki was alive and targeted him was hilarious to watch.\n\n- I found the detective storyline to be a bit over dramatic but apparently the essential part of watching this show is finding out that the most unrealistic parts did indeed happen. According to Google, Detective Lee Yong Jun, who worked for the Gangnam Police Department, was found dead in a reservoir two days after receiving a unknown phone call. He was working on the Burning Sun Scandal at the time of his death. \n\n- The Burning Sun scandal is a terribly sad case. After the excitement of the episode wore off, I was left with a feeling of dread - the perpetrators walk scot free, \"Victor\" is on a vacation abroad and there is no Rainbow Taxi to teach the villains a lesson.",

But for this week let me just say the real life perpetrators of what this case is based on should have gotten those sentences!! I'm still mad they didn't and appreciate that this drama has at least bought it back into the limelight. I guess fictional catharsis is better than no catharsis at all? \ud83d\ude2d.\n\nPosted the part below on my Tumblr but I'm cross-posting it here as well.\n\nFrom the preview it looks like next week's episodes of Taxi Driver 2 is employing one of my absolute favorite tropes of when someone hurts a person who a OP character loves and the OP character just goes straight up feral!!! I am beyond hyped I love this trope so much!!! And the fact the writers are employing it on Kim Do-Ki and Ahn Go Eun when they are not even officially together just shows how deep and profound their relationship is!! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d I know there have been people like myself who wished Do Ki would just a little more expressive of his feelings for Go Eun since all the jealousy scenes across both seasons have belong to her but this is way better than any jealousy scene!!! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d they're really giving us Kim Do-Ki and Ahn Go Eun shippers everything we could possibly want except committing them to an official relationship which at this point I don't really even mind because what they have unspoken is so much better than a lot of the other fictional pairings on TV these days!!! I just hope they milk this trope for all it's worth!\ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude4f\n\nDisclaimer before anyone comes at me: I definitely don't ship Lee Je Hoon and Pyo Yejin IRL. I firmly believe that it's totally fine to ship fictional characters however we want but we shouldn't impose our feelings and desires on to real people. It's terrific that these two seem to be pretty good friends in real life and would my shipper heart be beyond happy if they do end up together? It would be a definite yes but whatever they decide to do in their private life is none of my business.",

To my knowledge, GHB doesn't actually have a hypnotizing effect, so that part is made up I think. I couldn't find any information that GHB is used as a hypnotizing drug.\n\nSome extra facts even though nobody asked: GHB is analogous to the endogenous neurotransmitter GABA, which is the neurotransmitter that makes us sleepy as it is abundant in the brain when we feel sleepy. GHB therefore causes you to sleep but also has som ''extra'' effects(or side effects) like amnesia(which is referenced in the episode).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: wanted to add that being sleepy and being intoxicated with alcohol has the same effect on the ability to think rationally, as drinking alcohol increases the amount of GABA in the brain. Therefore, one may be more likely to do something they usually wouldn't if they weren't drugged with GHB/intoxicated with alcohol.",

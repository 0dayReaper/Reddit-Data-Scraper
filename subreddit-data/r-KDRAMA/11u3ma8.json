Just a few years younger than the main characters in the show, and having a Korean mother allowed me to relate that much more. Even the storylines with the parents were great! My all-time favorite show - even over all the great shows produced in the States over the years.",

This is a drama that I have never seen recommended and I am not sure why. It has 8.5 on MDL and  It's quite compelling so far.  It's a short series, 13 30 minutes episodes.",

Was not initially excited for 20 episodes, but it kept my attention, I got invested in the characters and am now I'm hyped for the second season (please let it happen).\n\nFL irritated me as I felt she took &gt;!too long to join up with the good guys!&lt; but her interactions with ML were great from the start.\n\nThe comedy in this was so well done, I found it to be so much funnier that some other dramas I watched that were billed as pure comedy or rom-com.\n\nIt's still winter here so I'm gonna find a long coat and swoosh about in it.",

Only on episode 5, but it is pretty bingeable, so far (one of those 20 episodes long dramas). For a chaebol, Jung Hyuk is surprisingly warm-hearted and thoughtful from the beginning - as well as a bit crazy (that laugh!)  I haven't seen Jang NaRa play such a wallflower, shy doormat before, so looking forward to a lot of growth. Fun to see 2 other actors in this one that were with her also in *The Last Empress*; in roles that are very similar to what they had there.",

As expected, Shin Hye-sun fitted into this genre perfectly, seamlessly and effortlessly. What an amazing actress she is. \n\nThe supporting cast was full of familiar faces from recent dramas, including Oh Eui-shik (**Crash Course in Romance**) and Jung Moon-sung (**Divorce Attorney Shin**.) \n\nAfter the first two episodes, the series was set to earn a place in my Top 10 list.

Some did write the reasons: It seems they hated the ending, the lack of personal development of a character, and found the second half repetitive and boring. \n\nI didn't dislike any of those things. The ending was not very well done, but I was told by LcLou02-shi that you could see his eyebrows &gt;!becoming white. He entered time again when she died.!&lt;\nThe ending showed why it was a &gt;!punishment to live forever.!&lt; I think some people hated the ending because they didn't see what happened.\n\nThere exist people who &gt;!don't learn. She had twohundred years before this, and it didn't change her, why would she change now!&lt;\n\nThe happenings were varied and surprising enough for me to not get bored. I was also interested in the redevelopment, and didn't mind the less focus on romance. Most of the important storylines where tied up in the end. \n\nSlovenia was beautiful. The jewellery and many clothes were beautiful. Also many other scenes where beautiful, in particular the past lives.\n\nHowever, I would not give this a higher mark than 8.5, because 1 hardly any jokes, 2 very little personal depth of the characters, 3 the philosophy could have been better developed, or at least 4\na better dialogue. As it was, it seems writer-nim has mostly concentrated on the plot and not had time to tinker with those other aspects. \n\nI wish at least that someone had said &gt;!\"Then make yourself lovable.\"!&lt;",

There\u2019s so many coincidences that connect all the characters but  what makes it a bit hard to believe is that &gt;!all of these connections happened to 2 people with the exact same face!&lt;. But hey, it\u2019s a Kdrama after all, and it was fun to see the FL &gt;!play a double role as Jo Yeon-joo and Kang Mi-na. So satisfying to see her fight back in the Hanju household and run Yumin Group as chairwoman for a few episodes!&lt;. Highly recommend this drama for those looking for a fun drama with a mix of mystery, action, and lots of comedy.\n\nNow starting to look for my next drama\u2026 I\u2019m considering **Crash Course in Romance** given the good reviews",

Also the cameo from Im Chul-soo was delightful. Glad I finally watched this show! Bae Doona's FL is in my top ten now. She's just adorable and quirky, I love her terrible cartoon doodles and her warm heart.",

Definitely not for everyone though, the slow pacing and nuanced monologues can get too real sometimes. Excellent acting from both ML and FL though. Loved ML from Reply 1988 but this was a while another level.",

Waiting for that 2nd part to drop must have been hard for those who watched the 1st part once it was out months ago. \n\nI had been trying to avoid all spoilers for all this time, and still don't want any - since i'm just 2 eps in into the Part2 at the moment. But i'm just gonna say - the graphic violence parts are just unfathomable, and i constantly find myself wanting the bad guys and girls to just die unreasonable deaths. \n\nAlso, the girl who plays the young FL - i thought i had seen her somewhere before, but couldn't recognize until looked her up on MDL and realized i've seen her in **Imitation** and **Doom at your service -** her acting has improved by miles and miles!",

I just don't know what to make of it. I'm in no hurry to finish it though.",

If you\u2019re not squeamish about graphic operations, highly recommend. The \u2018drama\u2019 itself is wholesome. I\u2019m excited about talks there may be a season 3! Also enjoyed the occasional joke/reference to other movies and tv shows. \n\nOnly thing that puzzles me - how are doctors complaining they\u2019re poor and living paycheck to paycheck?! I googled and they\u2019re one of the highest paying professions in Korea. \ud83d\ude06\n\nHas become my no.1 recommendation to friends who want to try giving a K-drama a go.",

            "comment": "HAHAHA, that was enjoyable.\n\nWith respect to whether the nostalgia resonates with Koreans... eh, sort of. The characters clearly lived through historical events, but aside from the existence of Choong-seong, who was a high-ranking National Security Service officer - the agency was famous for violating human rights at that time - and Cheol-woong's protesting and subsequent torture, I felt like there was a disconnect with the characters and the historical context they lived through. The only way you can detect the passage of time was based on the clothes and hair of the two lead males, the vintage cars, and other various artifacts (the brick Motorola from the 1980s!)\n\n\rWhat made this show feel old was the cheesy production - not just the visuals, but the story, too. I enjoyed it. But it was also a very weird experience.\r\n\nRandom thoughts:\r\n\nWhen did the actor playing Cheol-woong transform from a decent, promising young actor to an overacting buffoon? I'm not sure when, but it definitely happened! Maybe when he realized that his role was that of a frustrating, clueless dolt? That's my guess! All that wild-eyed screaming! The slo-mo punching the wall with music blaring! All of that was... awesome! It's like he realized he's in a cheesy remake of *Sandglass*, and decided to go for broke and embrace the cheesiness!\r\n\nIt was nice to see Jin Yi-han. His voice is velvety as ever!\r\n\nI loved the bromance between Doo-hak and his buddies! They are hilarious!\n\nSeung-hee was a great singer and a pretty good actress. Go Seung-hee!\n\nWhat happened to the illiterate but sassy aunt? She was awesome!\n\nFinally, a whole lot of praise for Jang Dong-yoon. His acting was really great and he rose above the material! When he was anguished, I felt genuinely sad for him and never once burst into laughter. But when Cheol-woong was anguished and throwing fits, I was cackling with laughter the entire time. The actor was fine, though. I'm looking forward to his next works.\r\n\nSpoilers!\r\n\n&gt;!Doo-hak and his buddies defeated a huge group of armed National Security Agents! With nothing but tear gas and their fists! Not at all believable! But who cares! People are getting shot but you just laugh. Because this show is ridiculous!\r!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Doo-hak lives! No explanation how! Was he wearing a bulletproof vest? Or maybe he is the Terminator? Or Robocop! Who cares! This show makes no sense!\r!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Cheol-woong is wearing lipstick! It's very obvious! Do a better job, makeup department? No, it's fine. Who cares! This show is bonkers!!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Jeong-shin is a brave asskicker! So much that she will shield her man when a gun is pointed at him! Because of course she would! That is her character! Cliched but lovably spunky!!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I was sad to find out The Actress and The Gangster got divorced. Bummer.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Even though Cheol-woong is a clueless dolt, he does have the most depressing backstory. That guy is your father. No, actually, that guy is your father. NO, ACTUALLY your real father was killed by the guy who you thought was Father #2! And also? You think the way to get a woman to love you back is to bully and manipulate her. And that doesn't work. And yet you keep trying! Perhaps because you were raised by a lying succubus as your mother! Depressing!!&lt;\n\n&gt;!But it's all good. Let's go reminisce about our idyllic past in the movie theater of our youth. And all is well.!&lt;\n\nSo even though this story takes place in the past, it has all the elements of a makjang from the past few years. &gt;!To defeat a powerful man, record him committing murder and release it to the media. Also, use DNA tests to move the plot forward! There you go, that's the plot of about half the dramas we've watched recently. Hurray for redundancy!!&lt;\n\nDespite mercilessly making fun of this show, I thought it was pretty fun to watch. Fun to make fun of, that is. No, just kidding. I enjoyed it. 9.7% ratings for the finale isn't too shabby.\n\n(What does the title mean?)",

A lot of the story plots heavily rely on the historical events and implication of that era. They also skip a lot of context because they, rightfully, assume the viewer already knows them. Not true for international fans. The &gt;!torture scene has a lot of implication but without historical context viewers will see it as a weak/superficial torture scene!&lt;",

He doesn't deserve their forgiveness. He's a piece of shit. I wish he was the one who got shot instead of DH. If that were the case, then I would have forgiven him. But he didn't suffer any consequence of his actions. I hate it. \n\nAnyway, the ending was still better than Duty After School. Lol.",

            "comment": "I enjoyed Oasis, especially since there is currently a lack of explosive on-air kdramas. \nI went in blind, and found the vintage vibe interesting. The male lead reminded me of D.O. He and Seol In Ah kept me watching. In Ah\u2019s character was pretty admirable as a kickass woman. The innocence of Jang Dong Yoon was fun to see. He is a more believable character than his prosecutor brother who gradually became more one-note in his range ie. shouty rage.\n\nUndercover villain was good till he dropped. Narc villain \u201cmum\u201d played her manipulative role too well. Her NSA husband is mush in her hands. Doo Hak\u2019s hyungs were a reliable ride or die. \n\nI was mostly enjoying this but the last 20 mins or so of the last episode was too makjang for me. The tonal shift was jarring.\n\nWish the NSA director shot his fake son instead of Doo Hak. Not sure why Doo Hak had to take the most hits. His father was one selfish and partial douche of a dad. Why should they be proud of CCW becoming a prosecutor? That was bought by the blood and sacrifice of their first born son. Not sure why Doo Hak had to be sent to agricultural school so that CCW gets to be best in high school. \n\nLove it whenever Jang Dong Yoo starts plotting with his hyungs. The soundtrack is lovely too.  All in all, it was a pleasurable watch.",

Its true to the emotion and is fun. \n\nThey wrote doo haks tragedy and the complicated and also tragic life of cheol woong quite well (i thought) and the moments that needed proper emotion got them and were done well.\n\nFor me Doo hak\u2019s &gt;!mom seeing him alive!&lt; was the tear jerker. \n\nSolid 8.5 at least if not a little more.\n\nEdit: wanted to add I found the actor and character of Team Captain Oh really good. He got a bit pityful near the end but I found him funny, dark and impressive throughout.",

I'm now in the episodes where KSH is getting edited out. I have about 12 episodes left to catch up on until Na In Woo joins (which is when I picked up the show again).\n\nNothing on-air is enticing and I'm still savoring the aftereffects of **Lie After Lie** so I've been pretty content with sticking to 1N2D and other variety shows instead of starting another drama.\n\nIt helps that I can have 1N2D on in the background while working on the stuff needed to onboard new mods. My to-do list as a mod is a couple of pages long, I can't wait till we get more help in the mod queue so I have time/energy to work on all the *other* stuff.\n\nWhile prepping for new mods, I took a look back at my *very first* [mod post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/fdew2b/the_2020_rules_refresh/) when I announced our 2020 Rules Refresh and OMG I was all excited about the sub having **85k** members! That's right, in March 2020, we were celebrating our growth to 85k members strong. How was I to know that a mere *three years* later we'd be at ***465k*** members?\n\nIs it too late to say this ain't what I signed up for?",

During their trips they see the local sights and eat local food. However, food and the privilege of sleeping indoors (as opposed to sleeping outside, usually in a tent) must be earned through games and missions.\n\nIt's a show that's been around for over a decade (first episode of season 1 was back in 2007) and has had major cast changes throughout the seasons though one original member, Kim Jong Min (singer, member of Koyote) is still around!\n\nI've watched it sporadically since season 1 but followed it more religiously since season 3 and for me, S4 has been the best yet (far less physical gags and the teasing seems way more good spirited and evenly spread out than past seasons).\n\nS4 has also done a few specials that really focus on cultural heritage in Korea rather than just local scenery so I feel like I'm learning *a lot* more this season about a variety of things.\n\nFun fact, one of the original writers of the show is Lee Woo-jung, as in the writer of the *Reply* and *Hospital Playlist* series.",

There's no big money prize at the end, instead they are just playing for food and sleeping arrangements (on that trip) which can both be more/less dramatic depending on what food is up for being served and what the 'outdoor' sleeping arrangement entails. That and differing team combos (sometimes they are in pairs, often it's 3 vs. 3, occasionally it's the cast members vs. the production staff) make the dynamics more fluid and less exclusionary than what I remember seeing on the Amazing Race.\n\n&gt; Food porn seems to be a big part of Korean TV.\n\nDefinitely! \n\nI think what's special about the food porn in 1N2D is that they make it a point to eat seasonal dishes on many of their trips so while they do eat a lot of the things seen elsewhere in other shows/dramas, they also eat some things that just can't be found outside of that locality during that particular time period.\n\nSometimes they also end up on missions that involve harvesting the raw materials for the dishes they eat later, which makes the food look even better!",

Which isn't to say that there isn't a lot of Korean culture covered in it, there is *but* since the show is slightly educational in nature, it's more about learning things together *with* the audience so it's easier to get.\n\nS4 recently added new member Yoo Seon-ho so if you don't want to backtrack a lot, you can jump into the show with his first episode. (He's also had an amazing track record of good luck so far, like he's managed to sleep indoors on all the trips so far which is *insane*.)\n\nIf however you're really into kpop, especially girl groups, then I'd recommend the new variety show HYEMILEEYECHAEPA. Lots of fun moments filled with kpop.",

I went into the show with high expectations and sure enough, I was gobsmacked by the first couple of episodes. But only a few episodes in and I am already wondering how they are going to drag this story out for another 8-9 episodes. I'm very put off by what IMO is a total and utter lack of chemistry between Gong Yoo and Kim Go Eun (and I agree with others that at least ageing her out of high school would've automatically made this better). Also their conflicts/conversations at this point, especially the last few episodes, are very redundant. The drama is losing that really epic feeling I got from the intro. Also I try really hard to root for FLs in dramas... so the fact that I really do not care for the FL here makes me sad, as weird as that sounds.\n\nI guess my question is... is it possible to really enjoy the rest of this drama based on secondary characters alone and not being invested in the main couple? (I also love the bromance!) Are there compelling reasons beyond \"will she pull the sword\" to keep going in terms of the plot? Does the same conflict continue to repeat itself in future episodes or does it stay this way? I know ultimately it's down to personal preference, but would still love any insight :) (Edited to say:  I do not mind spoilers at all. Also, maybe I should've posted this in the throwback post... sorry!)",

Appeared in practically every scene, and even had dialogue specific to the product. Hilarious but so distracting. \n\nFirst drama I\u2019ve seen with Lee Min Ho. I didn\u2019t think he was bad, I just didn\u2019t find the role impactful.",

Do I have to make a Kocowa account?\n\nYou do not have a separate subscription to the Kocowa website nor do you need to make an account on the Kocowa website.\n\nWhat's happening is that in your region, Viki has two tiers of subscriptions: the Standard Pass and the Plus Pass.\n\nViki's content is split into three levels of access: (1) free with ads, (2) available under Standard Pass and (3) available under Plus Pass (with 'Plus' here equating to accessing a *larger* library of content that Viki licenses from Kocowa).\n\nThe shows Viki licenses through Kocowa include both dramas, and as you've discovered, variety shows. Some of these shows are available under the standard pass while others are available *only* to those with the Plus Pass. If you look on Viki's category page for Kocowa (https://www.viki.com/kocowa) you can see which shows are available under Standard Pass (eg. Suspicious Partner, Doctor John, The Penthouse) while others are available only to Plus Pass holders (eg. Joseon Attorney, The Real Has Come, HaHaBus, Runningman).\n\nWith your Plus Pass, it essentially means that anything Viki has licensed from Kocowa, you can watch.\n\nI personally only have a Standard Pass on Viki so I wouldn't be able to watch any shows under the Plus Pass tier (eg. Joseon Attorney, The Real Has Come, HaHaBus, Runningman).",

I've finished **Hold My Hand at Twilight**, which I liked (I'd give it a B+), and **Why I Dress Up for Love**, which I really loved. \n\nHowever, I realized how conditioned I am by the white truck of doom. I won't say which of the two dramas it was, but there is a scene in which two characters are at an intersection. A white truck drives by and I flinched, waiting for the inevitable. And...the truck drove past, merely preventing the characters from seeing each other. \n\nI don't think it's the case that Japanese dramas are less tropey, but maybe the truck of doom isn't one of those tropes? Or maybe I haven't watched enough.\n\nAt any rate, thanks for letting me share my story. I'm now triggered by white trucks in dramas!",

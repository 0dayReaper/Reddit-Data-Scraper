In her 19th life, Ban Ji Eum decides to find a man named Moon Seo Ha who she met in her 18th life.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ahn Bo Hyun stars as Moon Seo Ha, who lives with the trauma of losing his loved ones as a child. His first love who helped him get through this trauma was Yoon Joo Won (played by Kim Si Ah), which was Ban Ji Eum in her 18th life. Moon Seo Ha lives a solitary life after Yoon Joo Won\u2019s death, but everything changes when Ban Ji Eum mysteriously appears in front of him.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ha Yoon Kyung plays Yoon Joo Won\u2019s younger sister Yoon Cho Won, while Ahn Dong Goo plays Ha Do Yoon, Moon Seo Ha\u2019s loyal secretary and longtime friend.\n&gt;\n&gt;[Source](https://www.soompi.com/article/1583582wpp/watch-shin-hye-sun-ahn-bo-hyun-and-more-introduce-their-upcoming-fantasy-drama-in-1st-making-of-clip)\n\n[Streaming on Netflix](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-takes-k-content-to-new-heights-with-2023-slate)",

As a child during her 18th life, the FL falls in love with a kid she was babysitting, but is separated from him because of an accident. As she's reincarnated once more, she makes it a mission to reconnect with her love. However, the ML is traumatized and guilt stricken bc he believes the FL died bc of him. There's some chaebol intrigue in later chapters, but mostly it's fluffy romance and healing tbh.",

I like the characters, the dynamic reminds me of Business Proposal\u2014the chaebol ML and his secretary/best friend as the SML, and not much of a love triangle. And the female lead has a fun personality\u2014she is very forward and confident, which I think will be fun. There is the trope of a shared history between the FL and ML and trauma related to that, but it\u2019s definitely necessary for the story, not just for fluff, and they support each other on that, very sweet. I technically still have a few episodes left to read, so I don\u2019t know the ending yet haha. I\u2019m on ep 93/106. \n\nBut I like the webtoon author, the art style is nice. I read A Good Day To Be a Dog before this (same author), and that is also getting adapted into a drama, with Cha Eun Woo and Park Gyu Young, so I\u2019m very much looking forward to that one as well! (Though I\u2019m not sure how they\u2019ll pull off the whole dog transformation thing\u2026)",

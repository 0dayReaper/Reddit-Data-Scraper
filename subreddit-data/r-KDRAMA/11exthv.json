Honestly, I don't know if it'd be weird or fresh to see a psychopath acting like that. \n\nThis whole show is a treat, and I'm so glad to have found it.\n\n[Episode 6]\n\nThe sudden scandal at the start felt like a whiplash. I thought I missed an episode or something.\n\nSo we officially have our fourth faction right now, who also seemed to be able to use Divine Power? Or at least, I'm assuming the Cult Leader uses the Divine Artifact to replicate healing and exorcism that Rembrary does.\n\nI hope the Afterlife/Grim Reaper faction have more involvement. Their couple minutes long involvement feels rather lacking for such a huge incident that is happening right now. With how they are right now, I am getting bad feelings about their role in this show and the purpose of them even existing in this story.\n\nThis episode felt rather weak compared to episode 5 imo",

I haven't been paying too close attention but when this new Road Manager came along, I assumed it was the same guy that had urged the devil, in a prior episode, to just kill the priest and be done with it, and he had asked to be sent in to kill him himself. \n\nSo when he became the road manager that is who I assumed this was, so then today I was SUPER CONFUSED when he encouraged him to join that acting gig and even offered to help. Ngl I liked him when he didn't know how to use a computer but then I was like wait wait isn't he here to kill him?? \n\nSo now I see your comment so maybe there are two separate guys? This is not the same guy that was with the devil in a prior episode? Please set me straight. I don't remember what prior episode that convo happened so haven't tried to look for that scene. Thank you!!",

                            "comment": "There was a scene where the grim reapers noticed human souls from Earth that were supposed to die and enter the Afterlife disappearing from the Life and Death Notebook (I'm just borrowing name for this since they never gave it name in this show). Their boss got pissed and call them to investigate and resolve this issue.\n\nWe then see the road manager appearing on the rooftop overlooking the city then getting hired as the new road manager shortly after, implying that he might be the Grim Reaper. His identity is kinda sealed for me when Rembrary noticed his aura being dark and gloomy (implied not Black Magic since he didn't start exorcising him straight away), which make sense for Grim Reapers of Afterlife. \n\nFinally, the devils have not shown to have the ability to shapeshift yet. They've only shown the ability to possess(?) people. And since the Evil One's helper and new road manager looks completely different (unless I'm blind and he merely dressed up), they are de facto two separate individuals.\n\nNow, why is the Grim Reaper helping Rembrary? Since they own the Book of Life and Death, he would probably notice that Rembrary isn't from this world. Seeing that Rembrary is trying to return to the Otherworld, there's frankly no reason for Grim Reaper to not help him. It solves both of their issues (Rembrary and the Devils are probably the reason for the human souls not supposedly dying when they should, because they are foreign influence from Otherworld which screws up the natural Life and Death order on Earth)",

If he wins an award for his role as actor, he will switch back, since that was the deal.",

I shed a few tears when Dal said &gt;! \u201cI wish we met in your world.\u201d !&lt; \n\nI also find myself fast forwarding the parts with the antagonist- I don\u2019t understand what he contributes to the plot. Without him, I think the plot has enough to work with. And it would be nice to see semi-antagonists like oh jung sin have his own real reasons to hate rembrary/yeonwoo and come up with his own ways to sabotage him. Because right now he\u2019s doing it partially because he\u2019s being \u201ccontrolled\u201d by The Evil One? Rather lazy writing which bothers me\u2026\n\nNevertheless still can\u2019t wait to see how the romance develops and how Wild Animal becomes famous!!!!! Sadly have to wait for next week again &lt;/3 this show is quite underrated it\u2019s rly adorable",

I love that he shares something so openly with her that he admits he hasn't really told anyone. &gt;!I also think the line from him that he never intended to go into the church and never wanted to be Pontifex is important. I highkey feel like Redlin is somehow actually a villain since all of these mystical beings feel.. bad. And maybe his village was massacred to push him into the role because he is uniquely powerful or something.!&lt;\n\nBut I enjoyed that he clammed up when she was like -&gt;! 'anyway not til your mid 20s? did you date???' or him noticing minor details about her - the sweat.. her hands shaking. So, that he sees right through her brave front and knows she's struggling and cares about her. It felt so gentle and kind.!&lt;\n\nI said this in a prior post tho - i'm going to be bitter if they make me care about this sweet couple and end it with them being separated. I want him to just stay in this world with her. I think they're doing a good job making OG WYW seem like a bit of an ass, too. So I'll feel less terrible if he gets stuck in the other dimension. He seems happy there anyway..",

They distract you while you are getting a shot or while drawing blood.  It's wasted on me because I do not care one little bit but it makes me laugh inwardly because it's so obvious.\n\nI also found the earlier scene where oops! she drops Rembrary phone records for the last month funny.

I just hope that the serious plot stuff doesn't overpower the humour. Already I'm feeling the dark fantasy stuff to be a bit much... I don't care.

I also liked that Rembrary follows more his healing vocation.  They also needed to humanize the other members of the group, so they quickly gave them sad stories!&lt;. Yes, the character development at it's best./s\n\nI am really starting to love this show.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nEp 6\n\nOk, &gt;!I know that Rembrary's injuries weren't fatal, but seeing him bleeding from his wounds, after being stabbed, and still giving entrevues was kind of comical.!&lt;\n\nDespite all the silliness, this drama can do heartfelt parts really well too. The final part of the episode was well acted and touching.\n\nIn fact, the FL's acting impressed me so much that I searched her thinking that she is rookie actress (because she looks so young), but it turns out that she is 34 years old and played in more then 15 dramas. \ud83e\udd2f",

They should've left out all of that crap, and instead focused a lot more on the chemistry and relationship between the leads. Make them slowly fall in love while trying to help the ML get back to his world, work out their inevitable separation and help the FL with her trauma. That Liz Ri issue couldve also been a more important plot point imo, I find it quite interesting that the ML believes he helped by waking her up but now they gotta stop her from trying to commit suicide again.

Idols truly help in the most magical ways. \n\nHowever back to the antagonist. I mean if you want me to buy into this  being the devil, I have the same question his evil helpers have...WHY DON'T YOU JUST KILL HIM?? WHY ARE YOU GOING IN CIRCLES? I mean in that hallway you could have just been done with him bam game over. I mean I get it that to have 16 episodes they need to drag it out but WRITE A GOOD REASON for me to buy into this silliness. His actual response to his subordinate was \"nah let's drag it out and have fun with it\" I mean \ud83d\ude44 and then ML himself was like ok why are you not killing me and he is like ohhh you will know what it feels like to suffer I will kill everyone around you ...and ML's face was like mine \ud83d\ude12 really? He has known these people for like a week! \n\nThe whole premise of the idol being a Healer again, totes makes sense to me and I am here for that, I am interested seems like a beautiful tie in to the reality that many depressed people turn to Idols and music for an escape or for healing. \n\nBut it feels like the antagonist part is unnecessary and not thought out. Like it was thrown in as an after thought.\n\nEDIT: Correction. Number of episodes is 12 not 16.",

They could just kill off the evil one in the first episode, it won't affect the story at all imo. There are so many things they could explore deeper, I wish we get to see more wild animal too, which I feel like the spotlight has been taken away from them because of evil one haha.",

I was informed that Wild Animal actual consists of ACTUAL Idols that unfortunately experienced the same issues as Wild Animal so their suffering is REAL and I want to support them so much so I WISH WE COULD GIVE THEM THE STAGE and let them shine more than the Evil One that doesn't need to be here\ud83e\udd79",

Ironically that was the same advice that &gt;!kim dal gave for the concept of wild animal!&lt; and this was particularly poignant given that the show introduced yet another faction\ud83e\udd14",

Tho not many people may have not liked it, Doom At Your Service is a show that did it well for me, the ML was a mystical devil type of being, but 1) they didn't go to extreme lengths to explain his existence and 2) there was no annoying antagonist, even the deity was more of a mediator.\nLike I said earlier they should've focused more on the ML, his healing abilities, and how that corresponds to being an idol and, everything you mentioned already.",

I am quite enjoying their chemistry, because their banter is pretty funny and easy going and I think gets better each episode. \n\nI also really really appreciated the show for once again showcasing an actual technique for trying to manage/get through an anxiety attack. Is it fool proof? Obviously not but I love the focus they have on him spending time learning about how to help someone struggling mentally because he feels so helpless that his powers don\u2019t help with that at all.",

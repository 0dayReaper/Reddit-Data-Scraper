People sometimes came to his court with the most unusual cases, but Ooka always agreed to listen. And the strangest case of all was the famous Case of the Stolen Smell.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***It all began when a poor student rented a room over a tempura shop - a shop where fried food could be bought. The student was a most likeable young man, but the shopkeeper was a miser who suspected everyone of trying to get the better of him. One day he heard the student talking with one of his friends.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***\"It is sad to be so poor that one can only afford to eat plain rice,\" the friend complained.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***\"Oh,\" said the student, \"I have found a very satisfactory answer to the problem. I eat my rice each day while the shopkeeper downstairs fries his fish. The smell comes up, and my humble rice seems to have much more flavor. It is really the smell, you know, that makes things taste so good.\"***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***The shopkeeper was furious. To think that someone was enjoying the smell of his fish for nothing! \"Thief!\" he shouted, \"I demand that you pay me for the smells you have stolen.\"***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***\"A smell is a smell,\" the young man replied. \"Anyone can smell what he wants to. I will pay you nothing!\"***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Scarlet with rage, the shopkeeper rushed to Ooka's court and charged the student with theft. Of course, everyone laughed at him, for how could anyone steal a smell? Ooka would surely send the man about his business. But to everyone's astonishment, the judge agreed to hear the case.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***\"Every man is entitled to his hour in court,\" he explained. \"If this man feels strongly enough about his smell to make a complaint, it is only right that I, as city magistrate, should hear the case.\" He frowned at the amused spectators.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Gravely, Ooka sat on the dais and heard the evidence. Then he delivered his verdict.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***\"The student is obviously guilty,\" he said severely. \"Taking another person's property is theft, and I cannot see that a smell is different from any other property.\"***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***The shopkeeper was delighted, but the student was horrified. He was very poor, and he owed the shopkeeper for three month's smelling. He would surely be thrown into prison.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***\"How much money have you?,\" Ooka asked him.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***\"Only five mon, Honorable Honor,\" the boy replied. \"I need that to pay my rent, or I will be thrown out into the street.\"***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***\"Let me see the money,\" said the judge.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***The young man held out his hand. Ooka nodded and told him to drop the coins from one hand to the other.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***The judge listened to the pleasant clink of the money and said to the shopkeeper, \"You have now been paid. If you have any other complaints in the future, please bring them to the court. It is our wish that all injustices be punished and all virtue rewarded.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***\"But most Honorable Honor,\" the shopkeeper protested, \"I did not get the money! The thief dropped it from one hand to the other. See! I have nothing.\" He held up his empty hands to show the judge.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Ooka stared at him gravely. \"It is the court's judgement that the punishment should fit the crime. I have decided that the price of the smell of food shall be the sound of money. Justice has prevailed as usual in my court.\"***\n\nOoka the Wise was a favorite of mine when I was very little.  Every trip to the library I would always look up at least six things...Science Fiction,  brain teasers, birds, ants, origami and Ooka.\n\nThis was my all time favorite Ooka story...on a par with the cutting the baby in two from Solomon.\n\nThere are many others...look him up if you liked this one.\n\nSimilar in nature are the Mullah Nasrudin tales, famous in the west from collections by Idries Shah.\n\nHere is one:\n\n&gt;\u200b ***\"One day Mulla Nasrudin rested under a tall walnut tree, he looked to his side and noticed a big watermelon growing on a very thin vine near the ground.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Nasrudin looked up and said, \u201cOh God, please permit me to ask why is it that walnuts grow on tall strong trees, while watermelons grow on think weak vines. Shouldn\u2019t it be the other way around?\u201d***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***At that moment, a walnut from a high on up tree fell and hit Nasrudin on the head.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***\u201cOutch!\u201c remarked Nasrudin. As he got up, and lifted his hands up in supplication, said: \"Oh, my God! Forgive my questioning your ways! You are all-wise. Where would I have been now, if watermelons grew on trees!\"***\n\nSorry for the long comment...this show is just bringing so many happy memories like these!",

I neglected to mention them, perhaps since they were harder to come by in the west and encountered them a tad bit later than the Ooka the Wise or the Mullah Nasruddin stories.\n\nThis is my favorite Akbar and Birbal story and it concerns my favorite meal (which we eat most often with kanda batata nu shak):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***\u200b Birbal\u2019s Khichadi***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Once on a cold winter day, Akbar and Birbal were walking by a lake. Akbar stopped and put his finger into the freezing water and immediately took it out saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can sustain a night in this cold water\u201d. Birbal took that as a challenge and said that he would find someone who can do it. Akbar promised a sum of 1000 gold coins to whoever could spend a night standing in the cold water of the lake. Soon, Birbal found a poor man who agreed to undertake the challenge for the 1000 gold coins. Guarded by two royal guards, the poor man spent the entire night standing in the freezing water. In the morning, the poor man was taken to court for the reward. On being asked by the king how he could stand in freezing water, the man replied, \u201cMy lord, I kept looking at a lamp that was burning at a distance, and spent my entire night looking at it\u201d. On learning this, the emperor said, \u201cThis man is not worthy of the reward as he could manage to stand in the lake because he was getting warmth from the lamp\u201d. The poor man felt doomed and heart-broken. He reached out to Birbal for help. Birbal didn\u2019t go to the court the next day. Akbar visited Birbal to find the reason. To his amusement, the King found Birbal sitting beside the fire with a pot hanging almost 6 feet above it. On being enquired, Birbal said, \u201cI am cooking khichadi, my lord\u201d. Akbar started laughing and said that was impossible. Birbal said, \u201cIt is possible my King. If a poor man can stay warm by simply looking at the lamp burning at a distance, I can cook this khichadi the same way.\u201d Akbar understood Birbal\u2019s point and rewarded the poor man for completing the challenge.***\n\nSorry for even more rambling, but Akbar and Birbal almost always reminds me of The Simpsons.  Why you might ask?  Because long before The Simpsons, the creator, Matt Groening got his start with a wonderful little comic strip called Life in Hell.  Part of the cast of that comic strip were the characters Akbar and Jeff.  At that point in my life I had already come to love the Akbar and Birbal stories, so the comic strip always made me remember these.\n\nLife in Hell brought Matt Groening to the attention of Tracy Ullman, and she featured his first foray into animation on her show...those were the earliest versions of The Simpsons.  The rest is, well you know...and that is why Akbar and Birbal are forever linked in my mind to The Simpsons.",

Sorry I'm rambling, but I'm really enjoying this drama a lot. The character motivations are really really interesting and engaging.!&lt;\n\nOn a lighter note, &gt;!can we talk about the cinematography in the almost-poisoning scene and how they color-blocked and timed the scene?

And having one guy be quite reserved and \"good\" while the other is more of a rogue is a classic setup lol. Except this time our rogue figure \"underdog\" is our ML so that's especially fun to me :D",

                    "comment": "I thought there was some great burgeoning chemistry in the first two episodes between them. I also thought the nature of their chemistry in the first two episodes was a little bit novel and addicting - in that it wasn\u2019t the classic take on endlessly bickering \u201cpeople with at odd values and worldviews\u201d. I like that there was more a push and pull concerning how to work together with someone who you\u2019re impressed and curious with but also still confused and morally disturbed by. \n\nBut they decided to not keep that up in ep 3 and 4 and just reduce things to \u201cyou\u2019re bad! I\u2019m good!\u201d \n\nSo.. I\u2019m kind of with you. They lost me with chemistry this week. \n\nI felt like something weird in the writing this week was there was no actual development or real interactions between them yet they wrote in a few scenes that went WAYYY overboard on the romanticisms? Like they tried to force chemistry that needed more time for it to be said and acted in a way that worked. I just felt like his lines in ep 4 needed to be said much later- ex: \u201cI\u2019m doing all of this for you\u201d or that ending swoon \u201cnow don\u2019t ever doubt my good intentions\u201d. \n\nI think the actors can do cute chemistry. That scene at the end of ep 2 when they\u2019re watching the trafficker meet his just end at the hand of the Chinese envoys - that scene was sooo cute and fresh. To me - it\u2019s more that they\u2019re wasting the chemistry because they didn\u2019t know quite how to have her move through the stages of \u201cI want to keep my morals but also the world is compromised also you seem way to eager to abuse victims that you end up advocating for so actually it\u2019s less a moral worldview issue and more that IM A LITTLE SUS OF YOU BUT ALSO THINK YOURE VERY CAPABLE SO WHAT THE HECK IS YOUR DEAL\u201d. \n\nI wish she was less befuddled by him ** like she\u2019s gone through the same learning arc with him like 5939483 times now!! Aka:  \u201cI dislike your approach! Ah! But in the end your manipulations we\u2019re done in support of the right things and got the right outcome  and it\u2019s the world and law that is simply very unjust\u201d *** and more suspicious of him. I think that would be a better dynamic. \n\nYou\u2019re right though - given that they\u2019ve made her SO Mary sue \u2026 she doesn\u2019t really have the ability to be suspicious.\n\n\nAlso. I didn\u2019t understand how she really had the ability to \u201cFire\u201d him and why it ever mattered if she \u201cfired\u201d him. Lady Park is the one who pays him in the end - not her. She claimed lady parks agency in a way that was inappropriate?",

                            "comment": "I really appreciate your insights.\n\nI agree with you, I just think that I want more interesting choices from Bona as an actress. To me, she is making safe choices, and it bores me. She has chosen to play the role exactly as written, without really bringing her own art to it. It's acceptable,  but it isn't exceptional. It also feels a bit out of place given the fact that most of the other actors in the show are playing up the comedy and the genre - this is definitely a heightened comedy, not a realistic romance. I think that if she, as an actress, heightened the stakes for her character, the character would be much more relatable, while still maintaining the author's intent.\n\nWhat I appreciate about Woo Do Hwan as a performer is that he is a risk taker; he constantly challenges himself with the roles he chooses, and he isn't afraid to look silly or even ugly. He is nailing the genre with this performance (very much like a comic strip character, but still relatable and vulnerable when necessary). \n\nSo, when I see the two together, it just falls flat for me. Maybe that will change with time, but as you mentioned, the script seems to be forcing things a bit for now.",

Han Su and his goofy sidekick can be full on Disney-esque bumbling duo at some points and it's super enjoyable. But Bona is still playing a princess at the end of the day. And if she were going crazy comedy as well it could throw the balance off in terms of what her character needs to be now vs. Han Su's!\n\n(Also, ofc, it's just hard to compete with Do Hwan. He steals the show every time.)\n\nTLDR I totally see your points and agree but I feel like I also completely understand why they've played it the way they have \ud83d\ude05",

We got some interesting glimpses into how Ji Sun (Hakyeon's character) fits into things too, though I still am looking forward to seeing more of him.",

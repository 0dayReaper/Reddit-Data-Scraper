    "postText": "As promised, I'm sharing my article, which appeared the other day on Next Avenue, a website from PBS/Twin Cities Public TV. They made it the main story on that day's page, so maybe it will attract some new viewers to the genre.  \n\n\nI want to thank the many subreddit members here who responded generously and enthusiastically to my call for viewers aged 50+ who'd be willing to share their thoughts. The only downside to the great response was that I could only include a tiny fraction of your thoughts, and I wasn't able to individually contact everyone. I was working with a strict word-count and had to pare way down, which was a difficult process. The super-upside was being able to chat here with so many likeminded souls about what we all love.  \n\n\nI hope you enjoy, and thank you! This community adds immeasurably to my enjoyment of and learning about K-drama!   \n\n\n[https://www.nextavenue.org/crash-landing-on-me-passion-for-korean-drama/](https://www.nextavenue.org/crash-landing-on-me-passion-for-korean-drama/)",

So it\u2019s not the wholesomeness that drew me to kdramas (working on finishing my 40th after just over a year of being into them). For me, as the article says, a touch of the hand in a later episode has so much charge is accurate. It was a shift from what I was used to but it made the characters so much more interesting. \nThe biggest thing for me is that the majority of kdramas are written by women, not teams of men or largely men as many American shows are. And you can really tell. Female characters are more complicated, realistic (sometimes), and three dimensional. Male characters are written with less of a western gaze and definitely more with a female gaze in mind so I find them to be much more interesting- more of an inner life, more insecure when they\u2019re crushing on someone, more awkward, yet also much more appealing and handsome. They\u2019re just better than most western shows.",

            "comment": "Awww, so cool! Congrats! 51 year old white man here. Wish I hadn't missed your post! I normally stan for Japanese film, but there seemed to be a dearth of them in American streaming platforms over the last few years, so I decided to give a Korean film a shot (\"The Host\"), and that led me to \"Train to Busan\" (one of my favorite films of all time now), and that led to \"Okja\". And one day, I was under the weather and decided to have a \"Korean TV Day\" and I spent close to 15 hours watching k-drama after k-drama, eating Korean snacks and falling in love with Korean television. \n\nNow I'm nearing a hundred shows watched, and no sign of losing interest in sight. My top five so far, in order:\n\n1. \"Mr. Sunshine\" (also one of my top five shows of all time)\n2. \"Extraordinary Attorney Woo\" (I felt so good watching that show)\n3. \"Vincenzo\" (just silly enough to be fun, but serious enough to keep me hooked)\n4. \"Under The Queen's Umbrella\" (although I admit it took a few episodes for me to accept lip injections in Joseon-era Korea, lol)\n5. \"Law School\" (there seems to be an attorney theme in my top five, lol)\n\nI've had a ton of Korean friends since my 20s and loved Korean food since then (my first connection was as a bouncer for a Korean restaurant/nightclub in the 1990s when the owner would insist I eat at her restaurant every night - she was worried I wasn't getting enough to eat, lol), but for some reason I never made the jump into k-drama until decades later. Discovering a love for these shows has increased my appreciation for Korean culture in so many ways - it's led to learning I like a lot of k-pop, it's introduced me to Youtuber Korean Gentleman (who isn't Korean, but is someone who has a profound love and respect for Korean culture - in spite of eating Korean food for decades here in America, I was nearly a neophyte - his show has shown me so many aspects of Korean food culture I never would have known about). K-dramas have given me more to talk about with friends who have similar interests, they've made me new connections, and probably the coolest thing is that I've connected with non-Koreans and Koreans alike over k-dramas. I've chopped it up with younger and older folks who like k-dramas - fun conversations with people from a wide range of life...and all of that would never have happened if I hadn't watched that first Korean movie. \n\nBarbara, really enjoyed your article! You know what's funny? I've had CLOY on my list for a long time, but haven't jumped in yet. I'm sure it will live up to the hype, but it's interesting to me that it's one of the most popular k-dramas around and I haven't managed to see it yet, lol. Thanks for sharing your work and your love for the genre.",

Haven't seen \"Law School.\"   \n\n\nFood culture: I love all the scenes of people eating together, sitting around tables with all the little plates that they're sharing, or with the grill in the middle. We need more of that in our culture. Korean Gentleman: I'll have to check that out, and K-pop, I'm just starting to learn about. Thanks again for this note!",

I love this quote: \n&gt; These were stories with so much heart and great story arcs, about wisdom and growth, family connections, respect for elders, with minimal sex and violence.\n\nAnd might I add, minimal foul language. As an American, I hate how much cursing is in many American dramas these days (f-bombs are now a common occurance). Although I'm under 50, I like my media rather clean and K-dramas are great in that regard. I hope South Koreans never change that nor the rest of the things that make K-dramas awesome. \n\n&gt; The majority of K-drama writers are women, and this is reflected in the storytelling and the development of characters. \n\nYes, I really love this about K-dramas and I think it's why the majority of them pass the [Bechdel test](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test).",

In my earlier years, I just watched them because my family members did so I\u2019d sit down and kind of pay attention but not really be invested. In adulthood, it was a conscious decision to watch Kdramas. I found that I wasn\u2019t interested in western shows and movies anymore. Maybe it was part of starting a family and wanting more wholesomeness or looking for something I can connect with deeper or something that has a conclusion. \ud83d\ude02 I haven\u2019t quite figured it out yet. \n\nI\u2019m happy to see Mr. Queen on your list of recommendations. I\u2019m a straight man in my mid-30s from the US. I see myself as a very open minded person who is quite progressive but that show really helped me to face insecurities that I never grappled with before and it\u2019s translated to real life.

I'm fairly confident I would not watch most of the shows I do if they were set in the USA using US actors with US sensibilities. \n\nGetting to see a different culture (albeit fictionalized for dramatic flair) is a big part of the appeal for me.\n\nA big complaint is that the last episode is typically not an entire epilog. After 15+ episodes of strife, let me wallow in the leads enjoying their well-deserved rewards.",

Sadly I have not been able to convince my friends or most of my family to engage with KDrama. Only one daughter is developing an interest after watching Squid  Games and Mr Queen. The others just roll their eyes at me when I start talking about it.",

It made me think of watching dramas with my mom and grandma, way back in the 90s when you could catch a 2 hour block of Korean programming on one of the local broadcast channels. Of course they were pretty different back then, and I thought it was super boring because I didn\u2019t know any Korean. Little me would have been flabbergasted to know that I would someday be a kdrama fan!\n\nI still watch with my grandma once in a while when I visit. Her shows are more the ultra long soap opera family drama type though, and she has to explain the plots to me because no subtitles \ud83d\ude05",

I was so happy when I found like minded people!\n\nI couldn't move on from CLOY. It took a long time. Even now I don't think I'm fully over it. It lives within me. \n\nI recently just finished first love J drama which was also so moving!",

I remember \\*trying\\* to watch another kdrama right after CLOY and just couldn't for a while. Finally Hometown Cha Cha Cha drew me in, maybe as a sort of a lighthearted palate cleanser. Next were My Mister and My Liberation Notes. Right now I'm finding it hard to move on from Mr. Sunshine. The j-drama First Love is on my to-watch list!",

I don't think of myself as necessarily being that into the \"wholesome\" aspect of kdramas, but this quote really speaks to me: \"Innocence that is less associated with nationhood and national identity but more associated with a universalistic and utopian way of existing within a collective community.\" This is a good part of what I loved about Vincenzo, my gateway drama, and about many other dramas I've watched. \n\nThank you for sharing your article.",

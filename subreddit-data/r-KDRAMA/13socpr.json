At first, I only wanted to watch because two actors from Secret Garden (my favorite drama of all time) were the ones who had a crush on the leading lady and I found that funny. But the series turned out to be really good on their own and they have a very beautiful and unconventional love story. The protagonist is younger than the woman he falls in love with, and they share a unique bond due to something I won't say since it is a huge spoiler. The boy also has the ability to read people's thoughts. Highly recommended!",

            "comment": "I started watching Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bokjoo a week ago (I know, I'm really late) and I'm absolutely and utterly obsessed. I haven't felt a lot of emotions while watching a drama in a while, but one episode of WFKBJ is enough to make me feel so giggly and happy the whole day! I squealed while watching every episode despite my roommate being only a few feet away from me (sorry roomie, good luck engineering), and I went to work with such a huge smile on my face because I had just watched a really cute scene.\n\nI think the way the synopsis is written and the poster make it seem much more reflective and slow than it is, and it's overall a very light and silly drama. But, I was really pleasantly surprised with how the depiction of first love and attractiveness was handled. And honestly the way the drama is usually so fun and light but then Bokjoo sees him and starts crying is SO realistic to how it feels irl lol. I also had my first love be a really deep and painful unrequited love (with a guy who was just too nice to everyone) and because of that felt very unattractive for a while, so this depiction hit me right in my heart. It was just done so realistically! I know a lot of people complained that it dragged on too long but I think it was perfect. First loves DO drag on and take a lot of time to get over! Also, her relationship with the ML progressed a lot even though she technically was still getting over another guy. You have feelings for two people at the same time!\n\nSpeaking of the romance in this drama, it was so butterfly-inducing despite them not actually confessing or realizing feelings straight up for a while. Nam Joohyuk is so charming (why did I not watch him sooner!) and their chemistry is so natural. There are a few scenes I swear were adlibs and in them, it's SO visible that the two were dating irl. When she starts talking about his nose bridge while laying on the bunk bed together? The beach playfighting? That has to be real guys come on.",

Currently on episode 21 :)\n\nYul and his mom are the biggest villains in this show. Yul has been a bug in Crown Princess\u2019s ear the entire time, making her life harder. He gives her horrible advice, stays stuck to her like glue, and sweeps her away knowing the consequences. &gt;!And he keeps confessing to her!!! Yul\u2019s behavior has been horrible \ud83d\ude2d He claims to like her but all I see is manipulation and stubbornness because crown princess has said her heart was with Shin repeatedly. And he\u2019s been in cahoots with his mom, just not as extreme. He wouldn\u2019t make a good King either as he\u2019s planted in revenge.!&lt; Overall, he further confirms why I rarely get second lead syndrome \ud83d\ude02 I liked him until I realized he &gt;!wanted his spot back!&lt;, I knew he was gonna be trouble \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAs for Crown Princess Chae Kyung, she needs some support in the Palace. It\u2019s so sad how lonely she is. She feels like the only person she has in the Palace is &gt;!Yul, who is manipulating her. It\u2019s frustrating to watch her keep going back to Yul knowing the controversy it brings. Shin has also asked her to stop over and over again. Yul is her friend but she\u2019s also seen all the scandals and issues arising from it. The same way Shin can\u2019t 100% blame CK for not knowing how he feels since he\u2019s been so cold and nonverbal, CK can\u2019t blame Shin for being mad with how often she\u2019s with his cousin. He knows his cousin likes her and so does CK. Yet she finds herself with him all the time \ud83d\ude2c!&lt; She is lonely and naive in the palace though. I\u2019m just waiting for her to connect the dots finallyyyyy and start being the best Crown  Princess she can be!! She has the potential! If Shin was nicer she also wouldn\u2019t have had such a hard time. With that said, I wish she would finish listening and watching the situations she stumbles upon because she couldve cleared up some of the miscommunication \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAnd Mr. Crown Prince. He did nothing right with the way he treated CK in the palace. It wouldn\u2019t have killed him to be nicer especially when he started falling for her. He has personal issues as well that need to be addressed but I gotta stand with him on this &gt;!divorce interview \ud83d\ude2d!&lt; He was honest and asked CK for one thing. On the other hand &gt;!he coulda confessed BEFORE the interview!&lt; the lack of communication has been crazy lol. Both him and CK have a lot of growing to do and hopefully they start doing it together \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffe \n\nAnyways, I like the storyline of this drama and the characters for the most part! I\u2019m not super annoyed by the dragging for whatever reason. I guess I\u2019m used to that quality of older dramas \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 hopefully I finish this today!",

I can\u2019t wait until you reach this one particular episode because it was THE episode that just solidified how worth it the journey was, to me at least. You managed to capture the emotions I felt when I was binging this. Echoing your thoughts on Yul because he was just SUPER unbearable. I\u2019ve caught a few second lead syndromes here and there but Goong wasn\u2019t going to be one of it. Anyways, I hope you\u2018ll continue enjoying this ride until the very end.",

I know many were glad there was not romance in the traditional sense in this drama, I do agree. I think the leads were very much in love with each other but in a way that transcends definition. This was honestly one of the best \u201clove\u201d stories I\u2019ve ever seen in a kdrama.\n\nThe FL was wise beyond her years - I loved what she said about being 30,000 years old constantly reincarnated. I honestly believed her when she said it. \n\nThe connection the two leads was beyond romantic love, friendship, passion. They cared for each other on a human level I\u2019ve never seen depicted before. They respected each other. The casting was perfect. The age gap I know was a hot topic and a reason why people said they would have been uncomfortable if they had made it a stereotypical love story. I think this was one of the few age gap \u201clove\u201d stories that I think was executed so perfectly. You see the more naive, hot-fire love from the FL and the respectful at a distance but not in a condescending way from ML - he never says he loves her that way but IMHO I saw it in his eyes every time. \n\nIU did an AMAZING job, especially.",

The original one is one of my favourite TV shows of all time, so I had at the same time very high and very low expectations of the korean version.\n\nAs of now I really enjoy it. The changes they've made so far are quite good. I especially like that the son of the mastermind and the effects of him &gt;!dieing!&lt; are not just shown in the eternally same flashback, but are shown a bit more.\n\nThe main cast so far is quite likeable, and overall it retains much of the charme of the original. Although I do think that the original characters are a bit more charismatic and interesting overall.\n\nA really noticeable difference is the directing/cinematography. The OG was very light and bright giving it a lightness, while the korean adaptation is darker (as in lightning) and not as dynamic, giving it a more serious vibe.",

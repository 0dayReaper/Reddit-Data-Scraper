The story points and actual outcome were fine, but I just felt this weight of missed opportunities. I really wish the dialogue had referenced the many people lost throughout, especially the more emotional losses. I really felt a lack of remembering those who brought us this mission for (mafia-style) justice, and unfulfilled. For instance, the vineyard could have had the names of all the Babel victims we lost. I get that Vincenzo and Cha Young express themselves more in actions than words, but the sparse dialogue really withheld the sense of closure and catharsis we seek in storytelling. I do appreciate how they handled the time jump instead of the classic \u201c3 years later\u201d trope.",

In dialogue. In character motivation. The storyline too. This wasn't a melodrama or slice of life in the traditional sense. There wasn't any whimsy. This story was how life is for so many people. And some viewers just don't want to be reminded of their own lives. Especially if it feels monotonous, painful, listless,etc.\n\nThis drama was incredibly quiet but so so beautifully written. \n\nNow I need to watch something fast and dramatic.",

What made me pick it up today is that the shorter episodes (each episodes runs approximately 40 minutes) mean there's no time for screen time hogging, show wrecking side couples/supporting characters, one of **Bo Ra's** major flaws.  This show is all about the leads playing off each other with all the other filler stripped away and that feels so refreshing.  \n\nI've watched 6 episodes so far.  The ML is very domineering and the show was obviously made on the cheap but I'm enjoying its pleasant cheesiness and the chemistry is so good right out of the gate.",

Interesting story and dynamic between the leads, a good non-standard ml that has some psychological issues. A good blend of developing the plotline at the same time as the character development.

I get that being a healthier ending, and I appreciate that they ended it on a \u201cbut see he really is drawn to them\u201d kind of note \u2014 I think I just needed more afterward. Anytime they do a big emotional drop at the end of a show, I need enough afterward to bring me back up again, otherwise I\u2019m still too deflated at the end. So I think I needed at least a few more scenes. Not to mention that they went through so much and now she just carries that whole harrowing experience alone? Ugh. I don\u2019t like when the amnesiac doesn\u2019t regain their memories. It always feels so unbalanced and unfair to the other characters.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Honestly, I liked it, but I think it suffered from the overhype for me. I\u2019d heard so much about it for so long, as it just being this phenomenal show, and it was definitely *very good*, but when it ended like that and I didn\u2019t leave it feeling exhilarated after all that emotional upheaval, I was disappointed.!&lt;",

I liked that Bo Ra is not a perfect FL - of course, she\u2019s good hearted but she\u2019s also over confident and full of herself, there\u2019s good growth. Her comeback was satisfying because we see how devastated and pathetic she was after the breakup (even though he\u2019ll always be an uptight weirdo with one suit to me). I love how strong and cool she is, she doesn\u2019t settle for scraps. Great chemistry between the leads! The enemies to friends arc is natural and believable with a good dash of romantic tension - how they help each other in front of their exes was fun! Lots of sweet adorable moments \n\nDownsides - the side couples were only ok or meh. The married couple are a bummer but realistic- the wife who tries her best at home and at work who has to accept her clueless husband as he good-naturedly disappoints her again and again. Too real for a rom com? Yea, probably. Hated the love line between the company president and the wide eyed baby faced temp - so unnecessary, no chemistry, gave me uncle-niece vibes, just \ud83e\udd2e. He had more believable chemistry with his ex. And the spoiled little sister was the wooooorst.  The main couple is the reason to watch",

The closing was fitting for a romcom, but perhaps not fitting for those secondary relationships.  \n\nThe husband wife that just seemed to 'fix' things was a little weird. The ceo intern relationship was very cringey (to say the least). The whole pregnancy thing worked the best, but their relationship didn't seem all that serious or developed from a character perspective. \n\nAt the end of the day, it's a romcom, and the leads delivered.  There were so many scenes that had me laughing out loud throughout.",

I\u2019m currently watching **Extracurricular (8/10)** and it\u2019s so intense that I can only watch 2 episodes at a time. So I started **The Best Hit (13/28)** and I love it so much, I\u2019ve been binging it. But then, because I\u2019m a glutton for punishment by staying up too late to watch dramas, I saw a trailer for **You Raise Me Up (3/8)** and ended up watching the first 3 episodes. \n\nMy take on these that the first two are well worth watching, even before knowing the ending. **Extracurricular** has had solid performances by the actors, great pacing (a lot happens each episode), and good character development, even with the side characters, since every character is important to the plot. There\u2019s no fluff in this series. **The Best Hit** has been the perfect antidote to the grimness of Extracurricular. It\u2019s been a real comfort watch for me with its engaging cast of characters and observations about the idol industry. \n\nJury is still out on **You Raise Me Up.** The title is so cringey, given the subject matter, I almost clicked off when the first episode automatically started. But so far , I\u2019ve found the main character to be sympathetic and engaging and the overall tone is warm, despite some hostile characters creating lots of dramatic tension, as they do.",

Within these discussion threads, you **must not include any discussion or spoilers** for episodes after the episode in question. Spoiler tags should be used for major plot spoilers within the episode. Individual episode discussion threads may be accessed through the links in this comment to prevent users seeing whole series spoilers. To participate in these threads reply to the comment \"Episode ...\" or another user's comment. Please report any comments that spoil later episodes using the custom report \"user has spoiled a later episode\" rather than the general \"unhidden spoiler\" report.\n\n**Whole series discussion:** General discussion of the series may be made as a direct reply to the post or a reply to another user's comment outside of the individual discussion threads.

Mrs Oh taking off that waist trainer with dramatic music made me laugh so hard.\n\nEven though it doesn't really make too much sense,I like the unraveling of the assemblywoman.  She's just so entertaining to watch.\n\nThis episode also got me thinking about the added pressure of being one of the few leading women of your political party. There's a sense of required perfection that their male counterparts rarely have to worry about. And when these women play the same boys' club games, the effects seem so much more damaging. It reminds me of former president Park Geun-hye. \n\nAnyway I know that's not what this episode was implying. It just got me thinking is all.\n\nAlso Mrs Oh's son is another useless character. Her dynamic with Ms Hwang,the race for the election,the chaebol family and winning over the people who turned away from her is plenty of conflict. He's barely on screen anyway. Why have him there at all?",

Very well written and wonderfully acted, especially by all the female actresses. \n\nActress Seo Yi Sook (Chairwoman Son) just OOZED charisma and all of her looks throughout were just *chefs kiss. I wish we could see her as the main role in a similar series or at least see more veteran and older actors/actresses as the main roles because their acting is just stellar and captivating.",

Severe yet impeccable and attractive. She was perfect for the role!  I loved the fashion throughout - the earrings and bags! All the beautiful shots. Cigarette smoke was beautiful. \nWell cast all around! \nI don\u2019t have much feeling toward Baek. &gt;!When he was talking about the persimmons on the radio show I thought he was making it up. Even when he was distraught at home, I still kept thinking he was making it up. And if he wasn\u2019t I couldn\u2019t feel anything for him. I think his Dad hanging him self on the persimmon tree was beyond cruel to his son. It didn\u2019t seem real. \nAnyway when Baek first appeared in the drama, I really liked him and thought he was a good guy!!&lt;",

When you build something like that, it likely balloons the value of surrounding land &amp; properties and contributing to the economic stability of Seoul. They also said earlier in the show that it has international investors and they took a massive loan to pay for it\u2019s construction (with I assume would also require collateral just as massive. Maybe they leveraged it against the shares owned by the group or something), but either way, that means if the duty free shop fails - it\u2019s basically a wrap for the group. They also said they\u2019ve bribed, leveraged connections &amp; even killed people to complete it, so I suppose the writers are saying the shop is like a castle built on the blood and bones of the innocent. It\u2019s like a den of every kind of corruption possible. For Chairwoman Son to keep being that powerful, she has to see it through and satisfy the people she\u2019s promised by carrying out her end of the bargain and maintain her power to keep her enemies at bay. I guess if she lost that power, any weakness or wavering and her enemies would swoop in to attack like a pack of bloodhounds and eat her for lunch. We already know one of those enemies is our main character, we\u2019ll probably see who the others are in S2. I think they hinted more than outright telling us to keep our focus on the main plot, but it was important information enough that they mention it.",

Transatlantic and Florida Man are two very recent shows that have done the same.\n\nMaybe this was supposed to be 12 but they edited it down to 11? This could be due to Netflix's big metric of completion rate, which determines whether a show is going to be cancelled or not, They could be trialing to see if odd number of episode shows are completed more than an even number.

Fun to see adult women in the most important roles. Very plot driven. No deep characters. Particularly the villains were ridiculously simple. \n\nDialogue is simple and straight forward, with some tries for deeper explanation, but without getting there. Some common mak jang elements. \n\nAt least it is better to see a drama about murderous  politicians from Korea, since it is a country where this has happened not too long ago. \n\nWorst plot hole: Do Hee's lack of planning and a sudden disappearance of some security guards.\n\nRecommend or not: If you want simple brain dead fun for a few hours: Yes. If you want a good development of meta subject or character study: No.\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\nComments as I was watching:\n\nIt is weird to have these top women chaebols. Is this really about women, or is it about men, but they put some female actors there instead?\n\nAll the &gt;!beating up!&lt; and things probably happens in Korea's much tougher atmosphere, but I would like to see the more quiet kind of fight. Where the woman says something at a meeting and nobody actually hears it, for example. The politicians who totally believe whatever they are talking about, but as it turns out, they are wrong, or they concentrate on very small and unimportant issues. \n\nExample: In Norway there is a system where some organisations get money directly from the Parliament, instead of through some standard system like other organisations. Parliament can discuss this for ages, even though this is small money. Or the amount of time spent discussing who is female and who not, instead of lack of natural resources.\n\nCorruption: I don't think actual corruption is necessary. There has been research about medical doctors for example, where just being given a small item like a pen from a big company, maybe an invitation to a nice lunch, but not too  expensive, is enough. Because just the fact that the small doctor meets someone big and powerful make them feel good and make them feel more inclined to support whatever the Big Company Person tells them. If they are outright given money, they themselves realise that it is corruption, and become more sceptical to the Big Company. \n\nHuman psychology and who we admire and look up to is really important for everything including politics. \n\nChange of political party. While politicians do move around a bit, mostly they stay with their tribe. The whole political platform is pretty important to most,  even if they do often have opinions that go against the stated ideology of their party, my experience is that politicians mostly really do believe what they are talking about. Because of the psychological mechanisms mentioned above + more, it might look different. \n\nPeople for example believe they are kind and at the same time believe that \"only the deserving shall be given this welfare money\", with no proper understanding of how to select the \"deserving\". \n\nReal life women on top: There are quite a lot of right wing women on top in politics. In Norway generally the left wing parties have men on top, the right wing more often women. I have some ideas about this, but will not speculate. Our first female Prime Minister was from Labour Party, but she was also the leader who really took the Labour Party towards the neoliberal economic policies. \n\nRecently it has been going around the idea that left-side thinks that the wealthy are their enemy, while right side thinks that the poor are their enemy. I think this is a very good summary. \n\nI would like to add that worldwide, according to Earth Overshoot Day, if we distribute everything fairly, we would all have a living standard similar to the average in Nepal or Ghana. If we become more people, or as the pool of natural resources dry up, we might have to all live on the same material level as people in Afghanistan.\n\nEDIT: Eps 6 a **key sentence** from Chaebol villain: (small spoiler) &gt;!\"The people who live like animals as a punishment for their sins in previous life\"!&lt;. While Hwang Do Hee mentions a Christian story. (But you know that Christianity also has its problematic sides.)\n\nI really hope they are not enforcing a noona romance with that small boy with superpowers who also is so bad at acting. So unnecessary and idiot and not well written neither.\n\nThe teen screaming to the adult is weird. Teens mostly scream to teachers and parents.\n\nThe father subplot. Don't they have CCTV? Why would she have to go there herself?\n\nBut the scene at the end of eps six is everything.\n\nEPS 7 Honestly, the idea of the taxfree shop being a make-or-break for the big company is quite silly.\n\nProbably will become a big spoiler, but I bet many have seen this coming: &gt;!Hwang Do Hee ex looks shocked at his boss smiling happily that someone dies. First of all, if she was that crazy, how stupid is he to not have noticed it before? Second, it is too exaggerated that someone will be like that. Even to say \"it is very sad, but since it is happening, lets use it to our advantage\" is a stretch.!&lt;",

Also, one of the sides don't actually have any ideology other than greed, and the other side is just \"give it to the people\" without any talk about how.\n\nI always miss the actual political disagreement in these dramas. While there is no doubt that corruption exists, politics is not ONLY corruption. Even when the politicians agree about the basics, they can still disagree about what to do. \n\nI think that all the TV-shows about corrupt politicians make us see them as worse than they are in reality. Yes, including in South Korea. We hear about the spectacular cases and they get stuck in our memory, while all those who spend hours pouring over documents to find a better way to finance that hospital/road/school without stealing for themselves, become forgotten.\n\nEps 9 Now everybody will think I write this because of that comment, but I was already planning to write it:\n\nOne similarity between Norway and Korea is to use some dirt on the opposition and throw it out at the last moment so that there is no time before the elections to prove your innocence. But a big difference is the use of family. Example: Jens Stoltenberg, General Secretary of NATO, had a sister who was a drug addict, and everybody knew. She died some years ago. It was never used against neither him nor his father, who also was a prominent politician. Gro Harlem's husband was a member of a different political party from her. We did have a case of a minister who had to leave his post because of his wife, though. A few years back.\n\nVery hard to make your family members do as you want. \n\nKorea's politics seems way tougher than the politics here in the Nordics, not just from drama watching, but also from what I gleaned from the news.\n\nBack to drama: I am surprised that Do Hee does not have a &gt;!spy in the camp of the enemy.!&lt; (tiny spoiler) And it is totally weird that the police station doesn't have CCTV. (&gt;!Maybe it will show up!&lt;)",

Particularly such an elaborate suicide. Her job has been to protect the family from such matters, so she knows how public sentiment works and fluctuates.

Even in the toughest countries murders are few and far between. Even in the toughest and most corrupt countries I bet that many of the politicians actually try. Most of the job is reading long documents and trying to figure out a way to make the budget go around, or trade with your opponents how the exact wording of the new law shall be. To be a good demagogue, you usually have to believe in what you yourself are saying. \n\nI would like proper psychological study of someone who from the outside looks like a hypocrite, but in reality just hasn't noticed it himself/herself.",

But a country is very different from a business, in particular you are supposed to look after all your citicens, while if you run a business you can fire those who are less suited. \n\nAnd in my experience, those who look up to the wealthy don't think for one second where those money came from. R\u00f8kke is the most famous self-made in Norway, he has for example fished up all the fishes outside of Chile. Or Stordalen, who owns a lot of hotels. I knew someone who worked at one of his hotels, and the working conditions were just not good. *They get rich by taking a cut from the worker's salary*. Don't know why this is not obvious.\n\nI think usually the very rich are more greedy than the rest of us, and more willing to go the extra step to get a penny more. \n\nPersonally, if I have enough for salt on the porridge, I want to do other things than think about money.",

They put female characters in traditionally men's roles and then *painfully* emphasize how female they are as if nobody there knows how to write characters that happens to be female (or imply that being in the role somehow makes them less feminine so they have to compensate and ironically follows the same progression of toxic masculinity. Do we really have to project this same path?).  \nWhile in kdramas, no matter how many \"disproportionate\" ratio of women are they, at least they feel quite people before gender and not a sad caricature of a certain culture war. Forcing female majority characters is only a problem because of a real world statistical history not a fictional definition. Isn't making something believably possible the beauty of storytelling?\n\n&gt; I don't think actual corruption is necessary\n\nThis is a revenge genre with the popular trope of justice perseverance in a society that has power struggle in every orifice of its culture plus up til this day are still dealing with the aftermath of its cult member and former prime minister (one of them being a social movement to crack down on cults and also bridge its victims). It's hitting all the nodes for its intended audience.  \nAs one example. Changing that tone negates the point of why they choose to write in main plot points of Candidate Oh to being very close to giving up multiple times, rather than a time device, or sideplot just to check off some realism.",

Not sure how female they really were, since there wasn't really that much character depth in any case, but they were definitely not among the worst I have seen. Like in the Danish **Borgen**, the female prime minister's femaleness seemed so added on. I think that in Western shows, even with one or two female writers, they will be so used to seeing everything from a man's perspective, so it is hard for them to write good women or in a more \"female style\". I interpret \"female style\" as more about all the small details in social interactions. \n\n&gt; This is a revenge genre\n\nIt is just wishful thinking from me, because I personally don't much like the exaggerated yet-pretending-to-be-realistic style. While corruption is important to fight, I think that all the TV-shows with corrupt politicians makes us believe they are more corrupt than they actually are. Important things to fight corruption is transparency, that there are many members of the political parties who check on what their leaders are doing, that the country has a relatively equal economic distribution \u2013 things like that. But it is always the one hero who saves the day, rather than the many who go out and to a little bit each. \n\nI loved that Imran Khan talked about how it could not just be about him. Unfortunately he didn't manage to change much. There has been many leaders who promise change, like he did, but they often end up glued to the president chair. To build a democratic, anti-corruption culture takes ages. \n\nNot sure how that could be written and still make a good show. Maybe do a show about the small, local corruption, with someone who is against corruption in principle and talks loudly about it, but then doesn't really recognise it when it affects themselves.\n\nExample my friend who wants me to get her husband to drive me when I go somewhere, because I have subsidised taxi. I tell her it is nepotism, but she still doesn't really get it.",

Guess she really is that gullible and think her company won\u2019t abandon her. Ever. Least she still has some money and louboutin shoes. \n\nBut yeah\u2026 It was something to watch. I would probably still watch s2.",

According to trial information, while Lee Kyung Young (then 41) was unaware of the victim being a minor during their first encounter, victim's testimony that she informed him of her age before their second encounter is believable and therefore the charges are established.\n\nLee Kyung Young was convicted and sentenced to 10 months of prison time with 2 years of probation along with 160 hours of community service.\n\nAs a result, he was banned/blacklisted from dramas/shows on the terrestrial stations (KBS, SBS, MBC) for many years.\n\nIn 2012 he made his drama comeback with *cable channel* OCN's **Vampire Prosecutor 2**. Other drama comebacks followed but primarily on cable stations.

She seemed to get riled up right in front of her enemies.  Even though she is definitely smarter than most people around her and deals with tough situations very well.

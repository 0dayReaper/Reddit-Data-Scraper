            "comment": "Lee Min Kyung &amp; Noh Hwi Oh in **Mad for Each Other**: The chemistry between this most unlikely of couples enabled this drama to address the topic of mental health seriously and sensitively. \n\nHan Joon Hwi &amp; Kang Sol A in **Law School**: This pairing had so much potential. There was a caring yet lighthearted quality to their friendship, due in part to Ryu Hye-young's priceless facial expressions in this drama. \n\nKoo Kyung Yi &amp; Song Yi Kyung in **Inspector Koo**: Of necessity, these two didn't share much screen time in this drama, but the scenes in which they did were dynamite. It was a cat-and-mouse dynamic, but thanks to Kim Hye-jun's performance, it was an unusually moving one as well.",

Whether you interpret their relationship as romance, friendship, or something else that's not easily describable, their chemistry is so refreshing and their story is compelling from beginning to end.  I know it's unlikely to advance, but I still would like to recommend Joan's Galaxy to anyone who likes sci-fi and stories that feature strong connections between female protagonists.  It's one episode of an anthology series (SF8, which is also good), and currently on Kocowa if you have a subscription, and on Amazon Prime with a free trial of Topic.",

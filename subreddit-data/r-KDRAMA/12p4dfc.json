Maybe I\u2019ll watch the new Jang Hyuk and Jang Na-Ra one because it sounds fun. \n\nAlthough I can't finish any new dramas I start (Dr. Romantic 2), I\u2019m currently re-watching Happiness and It\u2019s Okay, That\u2019s Love and I\u2019m loving them. I can't believe I had forgotten so many things. \n\nI re-watched the first 10 episodes of Flower of Evil too and loved it so much on my rewatch. It\u2019s still one of my favorite shows.",

The leads are calm and level headed but with sparking chemistry -  the kind of chemistry that makes you smile while you\u2019re watching\u2026The tone is realistic and the acting is really natural - I can\u2019t enjoy a romance if the leads are too goofy/clumsy/cutesy - I need them to act like normal human beings, not manga characters! Big plus for Nothing But You is that I\u2019m excited by the secondary couples - the other coupes are usually pure filler, so I am really enjoying this one! Thanks to other posters for recommending this one, I wouldn\u2019t have found it own my own - and if anyone has other cdrama recs like this one, please share!",

It's the kind of show I just want to watch instead of almost everything else, but I can't because I'm in there a bit too early to do that consistently (due to it needing translation/editing).\n\nI think they've made San Chuan a really good - engaging and realistic - mix of young and mature. He's definitely more mature than the other guys his age in the drama, and yet also does the silly things sometimes - but they're endearing, not annoying. It's like he's telling Liang You'an to relax. And the way he says her name... (where's a melting emoji when you need one?)\n\nI think *The Road Home* might have a similar vibe, so I'm going to try it out later on.",

All the dramas I have liked recently have been very \"heavy\" and I was looking for a light campy romance and The Real Has Come seemed to fit the bill.\n\nI binged the whole thing yesterday and was refreshing like crazy for Ep.8 to drop last night.\n\nThe production values are not very high, but it's so well written and fast paced with all the side characters and stories being very engaging. It's really soapy at heart, but it's an adult romance with all the characters having messy situations about sex and having babies. The only 50 Ep drama I've ever watched is Empress Ki and I'm kind of loving that Empress Danashiri (Baek Jin Hee) is reincarnated here and getting knocked up \ud83d\ude04 She was so so good as the villain and is doing a great job here.\n\nI can't wait for the babies (&gt;!I predict the IVF couple will also get pregnant again the moment they stop trying. Those 2 deserve a baby also!&lt;) to come and see how this whole ragtag crew will deal with it. It may be another 20 episodes, though...\n\nI wish there was a weekly discussion post, but I don't have the bandwidth to host it. \ud83d\ude1e",

I have watched longer dramas, but mainly once they were over. And then I would skip entire episodes. It's the first time I'm actually watching one like this.\n\nI like it so much that the lead couple is already crossing paths often, and that they are somewhat straightforward with each other. (Well, they're really not straightforward with anyone else basically, but otherwise where would be the DRAMA? lol)\n\nI wonder how long will the 7(?) months pass in drama universe.",

I try to hold off on watching so I can try to stack 4 -6 episodes to bing.  But I\u2019m liking this so much that I can only wait till Sunday to binge 2 episodes at a time.  \nI\u2019m enjoying this.   I like that old style filing and there are times when they are outside and the filming is cinematic.\n\nAm really liking the main characters.  They both seem to be aware they do some things out of obligation and then they realize it\u2019s their life so they can have some agency over their own life.  So the way they are figuring it out and messing up is really interesting to watch.\n\nI hope the fianc\u00e9e has more plot to her that what we see.  I hate when a villain is villainous and all the side characters (grandmother, her father, ML father etc) don\u2019t see it.  She needs to be shown for who she is and then take her character growth from there.\n\nI have yo go find something like this that I can binge while waiting patiently for the next episode.

            "comment": "So usually when I finished one drama, I watch the first episodes of a bunch of others before one grabs me. This time, I settled on **Remarriage &amp; Desires**, which was OMG so much fun!\n\nI admit that I started it primarily because the cast list included Lee Soo-hyuk, but he is credited as \"police\" and I never actually saw him in the show. I must have blinked. There's also a Park Ji-hoon cameo, which was a nice capper.\n\nThis is a kdrama with a capital D, just messy and ridiculous. Kim Hee-sun stars as Seo Hye-seung, a businessman's wife with a teenaged daughter named Min-ji (a delightful Kim Ah-song). When her husband, played by Kwon Hyuk, asks for a divorce because he's fallen in love with a woman he's schtupping, Hye-seung is blindsided. She's even more blindsided when the \"other woman\", Jin Yoo-hui (Jung Eugene), who is a lawyer at his company, reveals she's a honey pot who frames him for embezzlement &gt;!and rape and drives him to suicide (this is all set-up in the first episode so I will spoiler tag it if everyone wants to go in completely blind, just let me know)!&lt;.\n\nThe cast is chock full of great performances, from Park Hoon as Hye-seung's college boyfriend who left her heartbroken 15 years ago, and Lee Hyun-wook at his broody best as Lee Huyng-ju, CEO of a gaming company and single parent to the always adorable Park Sang-hoon (it was so nice to see young Uk from AoS again!). Hyung-ju is divorced after his wife cheated on him repeatedly (and was nice enough to blame it on him being busy) and wants nothing to do with women past one night.\n\nThe framing device is a marriage brokerage called REX run by Choi Yoo-sun (Cha Ji-yeon at her elegant best) that caters to extremely high-end clients. The marriage pacts are all just excuses for elaborate parties that look like the Korean version of *Eyes Wide Shut* (e.g., no orgies) and a ton of scheming from mothers, dads, grandfathers, corporate boards, the press, and politicians running for president.\n\nThis short series was a glorious binge. It's impossible to understate how all-in the actors are and how convoluted the soap opera plots are. Unfortunately, Kim Hee-seon isn't the most expressive here (she reminded me a lot of Song Hye-kyo's character in **The Glory**), which makes it difficult to tell exactly when Hye-seung even starts to have feelings for the ML, let alone anybody else!\n\nLuckily, Jin Yoo-hui is there to be the most epically batshit crazy villain since Park Yeon-jin (Lim Ji-yeon) in **The Glory**. Yoo-hui is a remorseless and chaotic wildcard, just butthurt that her childhood sucked because daddy didn't love (or acknowledge) her, and using that as justification to manipulate all over everybody in the messiest of ways.\n\nI *loved* hating Yoo-hui. She is *horrible*. She makes Amy Dunne from **Gone Girl** seem loving in comparison. You cannot stop watching the drama because you never know what she's going to do next, and you *need* to see her get her come-uppance. You crave it.\n\nSo anyway, it was great, all the side characters were great, too (my personal fave was Cha Yub as pretty much the Korean \"Turtle from **Entourage**\").\n\ntl/dr: if you're in the mood for a messy revenge series, this will not disappoint. Unless you're only watching it for Lee Soo-hyuk, in which case...",

What I liked about the minor characters is that they existed in their own and not just as a sidekick to the main leads all the time.

Part of that involved revisiting shows I\u2019d once started and stopped or checking out really popular shows I never saw. Very\u2026 mixed\u2026 success. Negative moment: I tried so hard with SWDBS because it seems to be one of the most popular kdramas and I\u2019m admittedly a bit weak for PHS, but it was an utter failure for me. That show made me so mad and I wish I\u2019d taken the time to seek out some more critical reviews first because it would\u2019ve prepared me for how off-putting some of it was. Skimmed until the very end. Even the much lauded romance couldn\u2019t save it because it felt late/one-sided for too many episodes. \n\nON THE (POSITIVE) FLIP SIDE, I finished Her Private Life that I\u2019d dropped first time and loved it. Lags a bit near the end and has a weird plot twist but the chemistry with the ML and FL was off the charts. I loved the secondary characters too so much. Also loved the art gallery setting despite hating ML\u2019s art.",

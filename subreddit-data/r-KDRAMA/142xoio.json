She hates her ability and views it as a curse. Because of her special ability, she is unable to trust anyone. Mok Sol Hee gets involved with Kim Do Ha (Hwang Min Hyun) a murder suspect who insists he is innocent, but nobody believes him.\n&gt;\n&gt;The cast also includes Yoon Ji On, Seo Ji Hoon, Lee Si Woo, and more.\n\nSource: [(1)](https://www.soompi.com/article/1589527wpp/watch-kim-so-hyun-hwang-minhyun-and-more-test-chemistry-at-script-reading-for-new-mystery-romance-drama-my-lovely-liar) [(2)](https://asianwiki.com/My_Lovely_Liar)",

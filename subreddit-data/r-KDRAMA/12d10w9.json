    "postText": "Grab yourself a knee rug and a mug of hot chocolate, it's time to reminisce those old time dramas from days gone by of pre-2019. Maybe you were  around when they aired for the first time and want to take a trip down  memory lane by watching them on the box. Maybe it's your first time  through.\n\nThis is our weekly discussion exclusively for those older Korean dramas on your currently watching list. We don't want to hear about the currently hyped dramas here, so please keep it to the older stuff on your watch list.\n\nReminder, **we advocate the use of legal streaming sources wherever possible**. Any comments mentioning illegal sources will be removed and links will lead to bans as per [our rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_linking_to_illegal_sources).  As it is very hard to find many of the really old dramas rather than  asking users \"where are you watching?\", we suggest you instead ask \"did  you find a legal source?\". See [our policies on streaming sites and VPNs here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/streaming_sites#wiki_vpns).\n\nCrazily enough not everyone has watched these classics yet so **please remember your spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;. For more detailed guidance on spoiler tags and when to use them, check our [Spoiler Tags Tutorial](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags).\n\n\n***Just In Case Resources***\n\n[FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and [Netflix FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101/netflix_faqs) **|** [Glossary](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions) **|** [Latest On-Airs](/r/KDRAMA/search?q=flair%3Aon-air&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=week) and [On-Air Roster](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episode_discussion_roster) **|** [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) **|** [Where To Watch *aka* Legal Sites](/r/kdrama/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas) **|** [Everything In Our Wiki *aka* Wiki Homepage](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/index) **|** [Get Recommendations For Your Next Watch](/r/kdramarecommends/comments/hl34w7/rules_resources_and_a_guide_to_navigating/)",

Terrible hairstyles for men which for some reason remind me of the first season of gossip girls. Full of tropes and some boys over flowers like homes. I found Song Seung Heon really good looking and this drama led me to a 2020 drama called Dinner Mates starring him. Have watched a few episodes of it and I\u2019m happy to report that he still looks as attractive as ever. Drama seems like such a refreshing mature romance as well.\n\nEdited to correct the name of the drama.",

I thought it would be suuuper dark and depressing, but I'm glad they went a different route. We are both totally hooked! \n\nSo far we have watched Happiness and Little Women together and enjoyed them, but this might be favorite recommendation for people who aren't usually into Kdrama.",

Every single word! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\nI was also one of SHK\u2019s harshest critics before- NWABU was seriously one of the worst shows (of any language) I have ever seen. Just dreadful lol. \n\nBut I always acknowledged and respected the fact that she (together with Son Ye Jin) were THE two Korean actresses that really drove the global Hallyu wave several years ago. Arguably she is possibly the Korean actress with the highest international profile today (or maybe I just see her front row pics more than anyone elses!)\n\nWith back-to-back disappointments (Encounter and NWABU) it felt like The Glory was really make or break for SHK. Three strikes and that was it. Tremendous pressure to make The Glory a hit. I always tend to root for the underdog, particularly in this case when someone is taking a risk with a role that is the opposite of what she is known for.\n\nSo I\u2019m happy that The Glory turned out to be not just a phenomenal global success but a fantastic series for us viewers to enjoy too. \n\nI am a such sucker for a successful comeback \ud83d\ude05 Now just waiting for Kim Seon Ho\u2019s return (and it will be amazing!)",

SO SO CUTE~~ \n\nThe concept was to have 4 dogs and their human mums on the show along with 4 guys. The dogs would choose the guy for their mum and the mums would decide whether or not they like the guy(s) their dogs chose. They all stay together in a house for a few days and go on dates with their dogs. (Edit: I mean, man, woman, and her dog would go on dates. Not man and dog go on dates lol.) At the end of the show, the girls would have to decide which guy they want to go for. It's a short 4 episodes show, and there were 4 hosts who made comments throughout as they \"watch along\" with us. There's a \"dog butler\" as well who'd go over and give them instructions from time to time (it's the dog in the show's poster). I'm guessing the dog butler belongs to one of the hosts because there's a segment where he was hanging out with the hosts and the guy in glasses was giving him instructions (that the dog ignored lol). \n\nThey really picked the cutest dogs (and their mums) as contestants. All the guys were really good looking as well, though I didn't really like the seemingly popular guy. I know they probably have to keep it G-rated, but it's sweet to see men in their 30s still go heart-eyed and giggled when they were talking about their dates among the guys. \n\nIt's worth checking out the show if you like dogs and don't mind watching a short and light reality dating show. I'm still smiling from the cuteness of the show. Hope they make another one this year!",

They use it heavily as a storytelling tool - the desaturation and the intense pink really contributes to the depressing feeling in the beginning and it's cool to see how they play with it.\n\nWe're at episode 8 now and everyone is *very* invested whenever they change up the intensity of the filter lol.",

So with the schematics that production chose to go with, by just genetics, there is a chance that you are seeing a pinkish overload.",

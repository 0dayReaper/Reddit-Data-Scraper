While Dong Jin waits for the elevator, you can see at the street level, Woojoo running towards the rooftop performance area.\n\nNote the second blue bus, two motorcycles/ scooters, and the slower white sedan car. You\u2019ll see them when the camera changes to show LSK. It\u2019s the same take from two different cameras.",

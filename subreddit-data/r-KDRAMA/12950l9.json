            "comment": "**Into the Ring** (2020) (Politics/RomCom/Drama): FL loses her job and her boyfriend due to her innate sense of fairness; she channels it into a run for local politics. ML is her childhood BFF turned career civil servant who shows her the ropes. \n\n**Good Things:**\n\n* The no holds barred heroine. She's an underdog in an unfair system - economically, socially, and politically - but she's been fighting back in her own way her whole life. And when she's suddenly in a position to effect change, she hits the ground running and doesn't care who's in the way.  \n* The *Parks&amp;Rec*-esque plot. It showcases the best and worst of politics at the local level. The ensemble cast of representatives runs the gamut from familial legacy egoists, pragmatic do-gooders, ambitious social climbers, and semi-witless lackeys. They all have an agenda, and their conflicts with policy and each other drive the drama.\n* The quirky cinematography. Love it or hate it, it's unforgettable. u/plainenglish2 has a [fantastic rundown](https://old.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/nihang/into_the_ring_aka_memorials_comprehensive/) that does it justice.\n* The sense of place as character. Between the home base fairy-lit manga cafe, the liminal spaces of bus stops, alleys, food stalls and overpasses, and FL's whimsical secret hideout that overlooks her domain the district FL lives in and represents has as much narrative presence as the leads.\n* The witty verbal/visual humor. It has overtones of self-aware mockumentary style productions, though less meta. \n\n**Bad Things:**\n\n* The narrow focus. It's all politics, all the time. There's romance and slice of life too, but if political shenanigans aren't your preferred genre it'll be a slog through large portions of the drama.\n* The temper tantrums. FL was a bit of a bully to ML when they were kids and the dynamic carries over into their adult lives in the earlier episodes. They get over it, but it's a bratty beginning to their relationship.\n\n**Interesting Things:**\n\n* It's screenwriter Moon Hyun Kyung's only Kdrama, though she's a published author of a guidebook on how to get involved in local level politics in South Korea.\n\n**Spotlight on Because**:\n\n* The friends-to-lovers aspect is roundabout - ML and FL go from casual adversaries to long-lost friends and gradually progress to more - but incredibly satisfying if you enjoy daily life romances that rely on small acts of service and support as well as the occasional grand gesture. There's also a great trope reversal where FL is the boss and ML is her secretary.\n\nIt's a 8.5/10 from me. Recommended if you like romcoms with meaningful plots, enjoyed the dilemmas and dynamics of Parks&amp;Rec and prefer realistic, slow-burn romances.",

            "comment": "**Alchemy of Souls**\n\n**Good Things:** The best partnership ever in a drama. They do not only do things for each other, as we so often see, but they actually have a joint project they are working on. The understanding (and misunderstanding) without words.\n\n**Bad Things:** I do find some of the jokes a bit slow and repetitive, and particularly Park Jin is maybe a bit too inane in some aspects. The villain is really boring, has too much screentime, and yet is not developed well. And the men have 80% of the scenes, worse in part two. \n\n**Interesting Things:** The meta-theme of admiring the strong and giving the strong total power. The epic ideas of fated love despite the worst inherited and new destiny. The theme of being alive or dead, spiritually or physically.\n\n**Spotlight On Because:** The drama received a lot of hate for part two. Rightly so. And you have to watch part two as well to get closure. But even in part two there are glimpses of greatness, and in general it is entertaining enough.",

            "comment": "**Fight for My Way**\n\n**Good things:** 1)None of the rich ppl stuff 2)Park Seo-joon's best chemistry with a FL was with Kim Ji-won and you'll see why. 3)Drama is relatable esp if you're in your 20s and makes you root for our underdogs 4) Friends-to-lovers trope has often been termed as boring but this drama does it so well right from becoming aware of each other's presence in close proximity, she-fell-first-but-he-fell-harder trope and the best friend to girl friend transition 5) Special shoutout to the leads Park Seo-joon as the lovable himbo and Kim Ji-won as the alpha badass FL. KJW is so versatile cause after this drama you'll never believe that she's an introvert IRL. 6) Show does the impossible by making us not bored even after the leads start dating cause they're so fun to watch\n\n**Bad things:** 1) Show falls into the cliche of the 15th ep breakup 2) Deserved a better and uplifting OST esp when the plot is about youth and dreams and it's such a fun drama 3) Second leads plot gets you on your nerves and could've been better 4) There's a faux-cest mystery until the 10th ep which is icky 5) Villain was very one dimensional\n\n**Interesting things:** 1)ML is an aspiring MMA fighter and FL is an aspiring newscaster so it's refreshing and the 4 leads struggle to make it big in their own fields. 2) PSJ's bestie Choi Woo-shik has a very interesting cameo and it's fun to watch them both appearing in each other's projects\n\n**Spotlight on because:** PSJ's most popular dramas are WWWSK and Itaewon Class and KJW's are The Heirs and DOTS so this drama often gets lost in the discourse. But it deserves to be the top drama for them both individually as well as a couple.",

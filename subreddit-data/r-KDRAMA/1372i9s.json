    "postText": "Grab yourself a knee rug and a mug of hot chocolate, it's time to reminisce those old time dramas from days gone by of pre-2019. Maybe you were  around when they aired for the first time and want to take a trip down  memory lane by watching them on the box. Maybe it's your first time  through.\n\nThis is our weekly discussion exclusively for those older Korean dramas on your currently watching list. We don't want to hear about the currently hyped dramas here, so please keep it to the older stuff on your watch list.\n\nReminder, **we advocate the use of legal streaming sources wherever possible**. Any comments mentioning illegal sources will be removed and links will lead to bans as per [our rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_linking_to_illegal_sources).  As it is very hard to find many of the really old dramas rather than  asking users \"where are you watching?\", we suggest you instead ask \"did  you find a legal source?\". See [our policies on streaming sites and VPNs here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/streaming_sites#wiki_vpns).\n\nCrazily enough not everyone has watched these classics yet so **please remember your spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;. For more detailed guidance on spoiler tags and when to use them, check our [Spoiler Tags Tutorial](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags).\n\n\n***Just In Case Resources***\n\n[FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and [Netflix FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101/netflix_faqs) **|** [Glossary](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions) **|** [Latest On-Airs](/r/KDRAMA/search?q=flair%3Aon-air&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=week) and [On-Air Roster](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episode_discussion_roster) **|** [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) **|** [Where To Watch *aka* Legal Sites](/r/kdrama/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas) **|** [Everything In Our Wiki *aka* Wiki Homepage](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/index) **|** [Get Recommendations For Your Next Watch](/r/kdramarecommends/comments/hl34w7/rules_resources_and_a_guide_to_navigating/)",

Kim Soo Hyun and Jung Il Woo look the same today.",

            "comment": "Just finished **Marriage Contract** (2016). Avoided this one for a long time because it seemed to promise sadness with the likely terminal illness described in the plot synopsis, plus I\u2019m leery of child actors in major roles. I started it accidentally and was quickly hooked, then realized which drama I\u2019d started, oops. The potential terminal illness was handled better than expected; &gt;!her death was left open and lead family is shown having a joyful time together at the end. !&lt; Fantastic performances from both leads, especially Uee as the FL. \n\nStandout performance from child actor (Shin Rin-ah) playing FL\u2019s daughter; she was the real 2FL of the show: cute without saccharine, smart but not annoying, childish but not a brat, and in some aspects mature beyond her years. I\u2019m not usually a fan of kids as main characters but it is necessary here and very well done. Watching the ML pivot his whole attitude, emotions, behaviors, and life plans around having this child enter his life is critical to his character development. \n\nIt feels very right for the ending to happen before the conclusion of any of the stories: &gt;!the beginning romance of the best friends of FL/ML, any of the restaurant employees\u2019 characters, ML and FL parents/families.!&lt; It\u2019s as if the show runners said, \u201cwe\u2019ve given you enough information to know what\u2019s most likely going to happen to everyone but we\u2019re going to call \u2018cut\u2019 on the last scene when everyone is having a really good day.\u201d This keeps the story from getting too maudlin and descending into despair as everyone cries, including me.\n\nIt was mildly amusing for the ML to be referred to as \u201cyoung\u201d when the actor playing was 45.",

It's a beautifully shot drama, and I love the main leads. I'm finding it difficult to watch. It's a very serious drama, and it doesn't quite hold my interest. But I will watch it!",

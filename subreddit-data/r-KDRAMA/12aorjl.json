            "comment": "I wonder if TVN is regretting airing Pandora in the weekend time slot given the ratings are probably the lowest since Bulgasal from late 2021. They basically had a streak of good to high ratings for over a year. I like these kinds of genres, but I guess the writing and cinematography just made people lose interest. I\u2019m still keeping this one in my watchlist though.\n\nCongrats to Taxi Driver 2 for continuing to top their previous weeks\u2019 ratings! \ud83d\ude01",

I'd rather say whatever upcoming weekend drama TVN has in mind could have been moved forward (of course, there could be production scheduling constraints given everything is likely scheduled in advance).\n\nIn the end, I would like to state that ratings aren't the deciding factor on whether a drama is worth watching or not. It is just because I like % numbers haha.",

            "comment": "Completed:\n\n* **Joseon Attorney (16/16)** \u2014 The first few episodes were entertaining, and the peak for me was about halfway. Second half, while I was still enjoying the performance by Woo Do Hwan, I wasn't as entertained as I was before. That's fine if there's another element of intrigue, but they threw any potential for grand revenge out the window. The finale was anti-climactic, and the Big Bad did not get what he deserved. I love revenge stories, but the finale matters soooo much for me. If you promise something great, and I don't get it, I will be mad (mostly why I didn't like another popular revenge story that came out this year). Needless to say, I was not satisfied. I hated the last 2 episodes. So much buildup for nothing. Yet, I don't hate this drama because I got to see WDH in a comedic role. A full comedic role. He's very charming, and his character was wonderful. Considering all of this, I gave it a 7.5/10. I would recommend it if you love WDH.\n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n* **The Good Bad Mother (8/14)** \u2014 This drama is so good. It's made me cry once again ... well, more than once, actually. I seriously love the mother-son parts, even if I get mad or sad. The romance is great, too. I didn't know I'd be this into it. This is the only on-air drama I'm watching, but it's my favorite thing this year so far. I would recommend you start it if you were unsure whether to do so or not.\n* **Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha (10/16)** \u2014 These were great 2 episodes. The best so far. The more we get to know the leads and go along this journey with them, they become soo lovable.\n* **The Devil Judge (10/16)** \u2014 I'm loving this drama. At first, I didn't know what they wanted to do exactly, but now that it's in the meat of it, I love it so much! Sweet payback! I love all the actors here, whether hero, villain, and everything in between. The bromance between the leads is great, too, and they feel like brothers &gt;!(hah!)!&lt;.\n* **A Business Proposal (1/12)** \u2014 I did not expect much from this drama because a friend of mine whose taste in dramas is close to mine ... told me it was okay. Just okay. I went into it thinking I wouldn't like it much, but boy did it surprise me. It's so fun and bright! Like, it's so obvious what will happen in the following scenes, but the execution is everything! It's so over-the-top.\n\nAlso watched episode 9 of **Lovers of the Red Sky** and it's just reaffirmed the fact that I dislike this drama because it's so ridiculous. Also, I have Second Lead Syndrome. I need a cure. Is there anything you guys recommend where the 2ML actor, Gong Myung, gets a girl? Or is the ML??",

She is a poor stunt woman who has a crush on his cousin who is a singer. The cousin had had his own heartbreak in the past. All their lives get entangled and to add to it one fine day the ML and FL realise theirs bodies have been swapped and they are forced to live each other's lives.\n\nI have been watching dramas with too much of corruption and deaths and needed something light and fun and this show is it.\n\nAnd I had forgotten how handsome Hyun Bin is. He has such a sweet smile and the dimples. \ud83d\ude0d\n\n**Tale of the Nine Tailed (1938) (On air)** - This is a fun show with fantasy and comedy.

Nothing I\u2019m raving about because he gave stalker in the beginning but they\u2019re cute now :) \n\n**Goong/Princess Hours (6/24):** I\u2019m really enjoying this drama \ud83e\udd2d ML is the typical rich jerk but he\u2019s not the worst I\u2019ve seen. He\u2019s also been warming up gradually which I love. His jerkiness isn\u2019t super dragged out like most in my opinion. I love him and Chae Kyung\u2019s development as people and a couple as well. I know I\u2019m only 1/4 through the drama so there\u2019s plenty of scheming to come but hopefully I still enjoy it by the end \ud83d\ude0a\n\n**Oh! Youngshim (4/10):** Episode 4 was the best one so far but this show isn\u2019t great. It\u2019s a shame because I was really excited to watch FL after watching **Devilish Joy** a few years ago and the premise sounded so cute. FL\u2019s character is just hard to watch and a couple of things are just a bit off?? I don\u2019t know but I will watch till the end. \n\n**My Perfect Stranger (2/16):** I\u2019m not a thriller fan buttt I like the leads, it\u2019s a mix of genres somewhat, and it seems to be well liked so I started it!! I hope to catch up within the next week or so. **Goong** has my heart at the moment so I stopped this in the middle of episode 3 but I\u2019m intrigued so far! \n\n**Recently Completed**\n\n**Age of Youth:** I liked it overall! I enjoyed watching each of the girls different stories. Some of the more serious parts like the &gt;!stalking from the older guy and one of the girl\u2019s getting kidnapped!&lt; threw me off though. It ending in a cliffhanger had me a bit annoyed but there\u2019s a season 2 I will watch at some point \ud83d\ude02 8.5/10\n\n**The Secret Romantic Guesthouse:** I liked this drama a lot!! \ud83d\ude0a was it perfect? No. Was there things I didn\u2019t like about it? Yes. Did I still enjoy it though? Yes!! The majority of the characters weren\u2019t secretive at all but sometimes I just had to laugh \ud83d\ude02 some of the story did drag a bit but I didn\u2019t get too bothered by it. I thought the main couple was pretty cute and I also liked the secondary couple. The ending was a little disappointing to me because &gt;!Lee Seol still had to give up his name in the end.!&lt; But that was really the only thing that could happen. I think everyone got as happy as an ending they could get so yay them \ud83d\ude01 overall, not the best written show or anything but it\u2019s one I enjoyed watching  every week despite it boosting my anxiety lol. 9-9.5/10 \ud83d\udc97",

            "comment": "*Finished*\n\n**Black Knight**: Okay, If a bit bland dystopian show. The setting, design and acting are good, but the story itself is a bit messy. There are some plot strings that do nothing and seem to be dropped or don't really matter and seem more like window dressing (eg. kidnapping plot, YSW/5-7 becoming a courier..). Many characters are also paper thin, although some can be cool (eg. 4-1). The worst problem is the villain problem. The main villain is very bland and boring, and due to his lack of depth many things around him seem more like contrivances. So overall it is a bit messy.\n\n**Hunted/Boar Hunt**: Good mini thriller. Visually gorgeous. The cinematography really helps to build the atmosphere of suspense, creepyness and even dread. The music helps as well. The entire village setting is just drowned in suspense and distrust. The father character is really good and interesting, and his connections to the other villagers/friends are very interesting. The utter contrast between friendship and loyalty they display &gt;!(forgiving crimes like murder or blackmail)!&lt;, while backstabbing and the callous way of dismissing people &gt;!(blackmail and just ignoring the murder of their friend)!&lt; is fascinating and creepy. The mother in contrast is very bland because she spends most of her time alone or with the family. Really like the way it ended.\n\n**Stealer: The Treasure Keeper**: Just a fun romp. The characters are not especially deep, but their interactions are always fun. And there are some nice character moments and heartwarming found-family moments (Especially the ML and his mentor/helper Mrs Lee). The stealing/robbbery scenes are always fun. A very high point are the escape rooms, where are not only great and entertaining traps, but one can also learn a bit about the history between Japan and Korea. The entire setting with the national treasures was very interesting as well.\n\n*Currently Watching*\n\n**Awaken (4/16)**: Very entertaining and suspenseful so far. Namkoong Min as always is really fantastic, and the two FLs are really good as well. The entire team has great chemistry. Special shout out for my man Kim Won Hae and my woman Baek Ji Won as the fun police higher ups. The mystery of the murders is really good, and the happenings in the past as well. I hope it has a great ending.\n\n**Queen Seon Deok (8/62)**: Very interesting set up so far. But tbh I don't know if I like or dislike the FL so far. Also, for someone who grew up in one of the harshest places, raised by a very paranoid mother, she seems very naive so far. Atm I'm more invested in her sister, the princess, and all the court shenanigans.",

            "comment": "*Completed*\n\n**Hit the Spot (2022)**  \nFINALLY finished my first drama of 2023 (been in a huge drama slump). It was a pretty enjoyable short drama, but I kinda lost interest halfway through and had to force myself to finish it. It is very rare for me to care more about a side couple than the main couple, but I felt that with this drama. The FL's personality just didnt make sense to me. She's been stuck in a relationship with a dead sex life for years, is shocked by sex toys etc, but at the same time she's extremely open to talk about the topic with everything and everyone? There were just too many things with her that felt inconsistent and made her not feel like a real character. If you wanna watch a sex-positive short drama I would recommend *You Raise Me Up* more (also starring Hani, but with a better and surprisingly deep storyline)\n\n*Currently watching*\n\nWhilst procrastinating from finishing the tragedies of **Till The End Of The Moon** \\[19/40\\], I started watching **Back From The Brink** \\[20/40\\] and absolutely loving it! Great comedy, pace, and already lots of cuteness from the couple. But as I have caught up with all the available episodes, I have jumped back into **The Eternal Love** \\[21/24\\] out of desperation. I started this drama years ago and could not finish it. It's...an experience. Sometimes, things can be so bad that they're good. That is unfortunately not the case for TEL. I just want to get this off my on-hold list and forget about it.",

            "comment": "I'm watching a lot right now so let me try to make sense of it all:\n\n**Bora, Deborah (12/14):** Mixed feelings here. Yoo-In Na killed her role and the main couple is also great but there are a few mediocre side plots. And the more unappealing parts of the drama make me sad... this is so close yet so far to becoming one of my favourites.\n\n**The Good Bad Mother (8/14):** I love Mi Joo, the twins, the acting, the &gt;!birth secret, the revenge plot!&lt; among other things. I could have done without &gt;!the cancer plot, and the attempted suicide!&lt;. Ra Mi Ran does such a good job of portraying Young Soon that I'm willing to reserve my judgment about the abuse of her son until the drama finishes. My main complaint about this drama is that it's sometimes too bombastic. However, the good aspects of it are more than enough to make me keep watching.\n\n**My Perfect Stranger (7/16):** I have a soft spot for time travel so I was predisposed to like this (my favourite American show is 12 Monkeys). It's a really solid show all around - the storyline is intriguing, the leads are great, and it's an easy watch (despite featuring a serial killer).\n\n**Doctor Cha (12/16):** Fun watch, with the occasional poignant moment. I just turn my brain off and enjoy the ride.\n\n**Thirty But Seventeen (16/32):** I find these slower healing dramas can go two ways. Either I don't connect with it and it's meh. Or I fall in love with it and enjoy every moment. I'm slowly falling into the latter category.\n\nOther Shows:\n\n**Succession (9/10):** Brilliant but hard to watch, it's just too intense. I love it though, definitely going into my top American shows of all time.\n\n**Drops of God (6/8):** Watching this with family and it's great, would recommend it to anyone looking to branch out.",

I know it\u2019s fiction but I feel like finding true happiness and ignoring the perpetrator is the only real way to defeat someone actively putting us down; or simply just ignore them, and by default, we win. \n\nI\u2019m thinking down the line she\u2019ll either realize this (that vengeance doesn\u2019t necessarily bring peace), or there\u2019s a perspective swap where she ends up being in a position where she seems like the bully, and she ends up being some kind of anti hero who we aren\u2019t necessarily supposed to root for",

            "comment": "Finished\n\n\\- **Joseon Attorney:** simply put, disappointing. After 10 above average eps writing takes a dramatic nosedive, forgetting all comedy and romance for political shenanigans and sad moments aplenty, to that the usual finale doesn't help. The only saving grace is WDH's amazing performance while you can't say the same about Bona as FL: she is gorgeous but has all of one expression and her character is so shallow and badly constructed she can't do much. As bad as it is in the second half it's not horrible, albeit merely a 6.5, more mediocre than mid.\n\nIn progress\n\n\\- **Bo Ra Deborah (12/16):** efficiency at its best as with a minimum of characters, storylines and all, it manages to be fun and entertaining. Not many surprises but nothing bad standing out apart from some meh references, In Na does her always solid bubbly FL and the ML is growing on me, secondaries don't add much but don't take up too much screentime so there's that. Enjoyable;\n\n\\- **My Perfect Stranger (8/16):** one of the easiest time travel dramas to follow in terms of plotlines and timelines. Crime part is not convoluted and, as simple as the case is, not all elements are revealed at first, rather gradually across eps making it less of a chore and more of a wait and see. JKJ is one of my favorite actresses so I'm biased but she does her part well and although I'm not a fan of KDW's stoic acting, he is a good fit. Unspectacular, adds nothing new to the genre but it's not boring and flows well, solid drama so far.\n\nSpeaking of KDW, **Delightfully Deceitful** looks interesting and the FL seems the dark, shades of gray character I love so count me in.",

Perhaps by the time I finish DR2 there will be a place to watch DR 3. So far, I'm enjoying DR2. Who could not love these 3 main characters and this hospital is so different from HP's hospital that it's ok. \n\nAlso began **Anna** so I could see what the hype is about it. Im on episode 3.

I strongly disliked the first season and dropped it after a few episodes, but someone on this sub said it's not necessary to watch it to understand seasons 2 and 3. And it's been fun! Can't wait for ML and FL finally really kiss already though! I been waiting!!\n\nWith non Korean things, I recently watched **The Diplomat** and LOVED it. That's just my type of show. Political scheming, personal problems, a wonderful female lead, some decent humour, and that ending!! I need the next season NOW.\n\nAnd because after that show I was so in love with Keri Russell, I decided it's time to re-watch The Americans! So now I'm happily binging it and already on Season 3.

            "comment": "Bora Deborah (12/14) I love this drama very much! Bora is such a complex and yet still very fun heroine. She is a mess most of the time but very put together on the outside. Su-Hyeok is a great foil to her: reserved and doesn't show his emotions easily but not your typical cold male lead. He shows he cares with his actions, not his words. I think the married couple is a disaster waiting to happen and both actors are killing their roles. And then there is Bo-mi and army guy. They are just trying not to let all the BS get in the way of how much they like each other. When will all the adults learn to be as honest about their feelings? The one storyline I don't understand is the boss and young employee. I don't really get what they are trying to say with their relationship. I hope this can stick the landing. Unlike a lot of other romance dramas, all of the plots focus on relationships and relationship dynamics and it has remained for the entire series. \n\nAnd that's it. Just continuing to watch Taskmaster and random YouTube videos. I did watch one where a knitting YouTuber traveled to Seoul and visited a BEAUTIFUL yarn store called Banul. Gorgeous store with fantastic crocheted bags.",

But I've been distracted by variety shows and other dramas that I haven't been able to have time for this one. It's just that this show is pretty mellow and everything else I've been watching has me laughing so hard I can barely breathe.\n\n**The Heavenly Idol** (9/12): Started watching for Lee Jangwoo, stayed for the silliness. It's almost too silly. And the villain isn't evil enough. For someone who's supposed to have strong powers, his methods for ruining Lembrary's journey to becoming the top idol aren't very effective. If I don't think about the plot, it's pretty fun and there are some parts that make me laugh out loud.\n\n**Doctor Cha** (12/16): This one's been fun. The husband is such a jerk, but some of his actions and facial expressions makes me laugh.",

I liked that they brought back the main issue of the ML back and may even address this. Also liked the rest of the character. They have couple at all stages - just fallen in love, divorced, married for too long, office crushes, messy breakups, situation ships and undefined relationships. The FL's breakup with her ex was a bit too stretched in the middle episodes. Other than that the show has been a good watch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Secret Royal Inspector &amp; Joy** : Watched till 13 or 14 episodes. It was funny in the beginning and became sillier as the series progressed. I am all for silly fun but it has become too silly. Completing it has become a chore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWaiting for the last week of Doctor Cha to start binge watching. I have kept myself away from all updates, clips on SNS and I am going to watch this with fresh eyes. Looking at the ratings, hoping this would be an awesome watch.",

I dropped s1 but s2 is a rollercoaster ride with a lot of comedy and action. Now the story is taking a darker turn and I'm here for it. I want to see what they do with Lee Yeon and the fallout of his obsession with Ae-reum/Ji-ah.\n\n**Hogu's Love (2/16):** This is a 2015 drama that recently became available in the US. Even though it has the slapsticky humor and budget production values you'd expect from an older drama, it's also unexpectedly sweet and poignant with a complex female lead and well done plot twists. Something I'm struck by is how much more open the drama is about sex than most dramas today. \n\n**A Tale of a Thousand Stars (6/10):** This is a Thai BL that's different than most. Instead of being set at a high school or university it takes place in a rural village and one of the MLs is a forest ranger and the other is a school teacher. The plot is a little contrived and involves a heart transplant and other makjang elements, but overall it's a very sweet slow burn love story that also has interesting details about a different part of Thailand than you usually see in dramas.",

It's my second favorite long family drama after My Father Is Strange, though a distant second. It lacks the star power of the former, and some of its arcs are a bit of a slog. But overall it was a sweet comfort watch for me. 7.5/10 Stars \n\n**Love Affairs In The Afternoon** (16/16) - This one is an adaptation of a Japanese show and the makers didn't try much to Kdrama-fy it. I felt throughout that I was watching a Jdrama instead of a Kdrama. Since Jdramas aren't my scene, it was a struggle to finish this one but I stuck till the end for the unusual storyline of regular people cheating on their spouses and the actors (especially Lee Sang Yeob). It could be a good watch for those who enjoy the Japanese style of storytelling. 6/10 Stars\n\n(Thailand) **A Boss And A Babe** (12/12) - This cute little BL was my serotonin boost every week. I don't care for the plot holes or the improperness of a boss dating an intern - not when the boys are so sweet and wholesome together. 9/10 Stars\n\n**Watching:-**\n\n**Bo Ra Deborah** (12/14) - I'm enjoying the growing attraction between the leads as well as the jealousy of the jerk ex. Yoo In-Na is hard carrying this one. The side couples are all boring though. I especially dislike Bora's friend and her husband, both as individuals and together.\n\n**Love Mate** (6/8) -  This romcom is the perfect mix of  rom and com. When it's funny it's hilarious, and when it turns on the romance I swoon. It ends tomorrow and if they manage to stick the landing, this one will go into my top 5 KBLs list. \n\n**Starstruck** (2/8) - One of those shows where the silences speak louder than words. The kids are all real and relatable. I'm prepared for the coming angst.\n\n**Dropped:-**\n\n**Oh! Youngsim** - Had high hopes from this one as Korea makes so few romcoms nowadays, but this one was a non-starter. The writing is weak, the characters are not likable, and the actors are either overacting or underacting. Dropped after 2 episodes.\n\n**Happy Merry Ending** - Boring, badly paced. I understand casting Idols for their looks but not when they have zero acting skills. Dropped after 2 episodes.",

The FL family is atrocious aside from her son and mom but her bff and ML are getting my hopes up. I like seeing older leads although I am in disbelief at the casting choice of FL mom - she doe not look old enough.\n\n\nCompleted **From Now On, Showtime!** which was mostly a fun watch. The historical scenes dragged a bit and I felt it could've been ended at 12 episodes after the main villain was kinda caught. Loved the ghosts and the ending was very satisfactory.\n\n\nAlso completed **What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?** which I liked but didn't quite believe the chemistry between FL and ML. Maybe too fluffy for my current tastes.",

            "comment": "Completed: \n\n- welcome to Waikiki 2. It\u2019s similar to s1 with its comedy, but not as funny. Would I watch it again? Yeah, as a background drama. You won\u2019t miss much because if you\u2019re not fully paying attention. \n\nCurrently watching: \n\n- bora Deborah (12/14): it\u2019s a fun watch. Not perfect, but it has been keeping me entertained. As a 2pm fan, I picked it up because of Chansung (2ml). While his character is an awful person, I think Chansung is doing a good job with the role, though I may be biased. Hope to see him continue growing. \n\n- my perfect stranger (8/16): I\u2019m really into this drama and I have no idea why. The fl is so pretty (and young looking) and I can\u2019t believe how good looking the ml is especially compared to some of the pictures from his younger days. I\u2019m really liking his current look. I can\u2019t wait to see how this all unfolds. \n\n- legend of the blue sea (9/16): my current fave. So funny and cute at times. Loved the surprise appearance of young Jinyoung and jo jong suk. I\u2019m usually a sucker for hot guys (aren\u2019t we all?) and while I don't think JJS is hot, he won me over as chef in Oh My Ghost. \n\n- Dr romantic s1 (5/20). I\u2019m so not in the mood for this right now so it has become my mealtime drama. It\u2019s not bad, I think I just don\u2019t want hospital stuff at this time. However, with half the year gone, I need to start since I\u2019m using this for my 50+ drama in the challenge. \n\n- I hear your voice (1/18). I dislike older dramas because of how it\u2019s shot, but this isn\u2019t so bad. I\u2019m also watching this for the challenge plus I promised someone on here that I\u2019d watch it with them. I\u2019m surprised that I\u2019m kind of into it already. Lawyer lady seems interesting. Not sure how she ties into the ml in present time (I\u2019m aware of what happened in the last). I also finally understand what the title is in reference to. I initially thought this was a singing drama. Lol.",

The time travel has honestly been less of a factor than I hoped (so far), but it's still intriguing.\n\nYou got a head start on me with **I Hear Your Voice**! I'm still trying to decide where to re-watch it.",

Seems kind of slapstick so far but I don\u2019t care\u2014it\u2019s light hearted and perfect to start my summer. Plus it\u2019s fun to have it set in a historic time period that isn\u2019t Joseon dynasty.\n\nAgain My Life (14/16) - Still plodding away through this. Maybe I\u2019ll finally finish it this week. It\u2019s just so slow-moving at this point\u2026\n\nRecently finished:\n\nTrue to Love - didn\u2019t end as strongly as I had hoped but I still really liked it! I especially liked chatting about it in the On Air Discussions as it aired.\n\nTale of the Nine Tailed - I\u2019ve been watching this in spurts over time but needed to finish it finally so I could start the 1938 season. It was ok. Not mind blowing or anything. I like the characters though and am glad to see them in more adventures tbh.\n\nDescendants of the Sun - I put this on hold a few months ago bc the first episode didn\u2019t grab me, but I took the advice I keep seeing to give dramas 3-4 episodes and I\u2019m glad I did. Song Joong Ki is good at what he does.\n\nSungkyunkwan Scandal - finished this right before picking Descendants of the Sun back up lol It was a fun drama and SJK and his smirk are so fabulous in this!",

It was interesting how it moved through time. I enjoyed the characters. There isn't any romance. It's really about the hustle of navigating getting ahead in life as a teacher and a student. \n\nI also just finished Because this is my first life. I get why some people hated how the FL acted at the end, and it wasn't my favorite, but I understand her motivation to &gt;!want to be with someone who is whole and wants to live life fully. Not just a ML who has never healed from a past traumatic breakup that she would have to tip toe around!&lt; I will say I found their boundaries &gt;!with their family as a married couple extreme. Boundaries are important, but I didn't think they had to go so far in not connecting to each others family ever!&lt;",

Deborah (12/14)** \\- It can get kind of cringey then very somber which gets confusing but for whatever reason I keep tuning in. Yoo In Na can be very charming but maybe she'll try a different role in her next project. \n\n**Doctor Cha (11/16)** \\- I can't quite tell what type of drama this is - medical, makjang, coming of age, noona romance? Most of the characters are unlikeable and the lead is weaker than I would like. There's been some nice story advancement recently but I may hold off and binge once the entire series is aired.\n\n**Love Mate (4/8)** \\- Kind of creepy BL and the characters are kind of cardboard. I haven't gotten into it yet.\n\nDefinitely looking forward to Bloodhounds, King the Land and See You in My 19th Life so June should be busy with on-air programs.",

            "comment": "- Love to Hate You: I think I've watched this one...3 times all the way through now? I just love that, 1, it's shorter than regular dramas at only 10 episodes, so it's easy to get through, and 2, that it's actually really kind of wholesome at its heart? Like I know it's technically a mature show and has a higher rating because of the language and the topics, but the story itself and the relationships between the ML and FL, and then the ML and his BFF and the FL and her BFF are so well-rounded and multi-dimensional, I think. \n- Alchemy of Souls: I am literally on the last episode of the second season and I just can't bring myself to watch it. This whole second season has had me feeling really conflicted, and a part of me wishes I hadn't started it, but then again I couldn't just not watch it after the way the first season ended. So I dunno, somehow I'm gonna have to psych myself up to watch the last episode and find out how the whole thing ends.\n- Welcome to Waikiki: I'm only on episode 2, but so far it looks like it's gonna be kinda fluffy and fun, so I'm looking forward to watching it as my way of decompressing after work, lol\n- Love in Contract: has anyone else had the feeling that it was inspired a little bit by Breakfast at Tiffany's? And specifically the novella, not the Audrey Hepburn movie. And by that I mean Gwang Nam. I don't wanna say too much more because I'm typing on my phone and I don't think I can do spoiler blocks, but if anyone knows what I'm talking about and sees what I'm saying, lmk!!",

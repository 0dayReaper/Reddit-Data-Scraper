    "postText": "So recently I\u2019ve seen ppl on Twitter criticising fans of true beauty and saying that if dramas such as true beauty, love alarm, or my id is gangnam beauty are your favourite then you either have no taste or you\u2019ve only ever watched that one drama. This is a really toxic mindset when really it\u2019s just all about taste. I\u2019ve watched kdramas since 2008 because my family is korean so I used to watch the old ones like The Great Queen Seondeok and even Winter Sonata with my parents all the time. Even as I got older, I\u2019ve watched so many out of my own desire to watch them, and guess what? Love Alarm is my personal favourite.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best kdrama ever made in terms of plot, drama, etc. but it\u2019s my favourite bc it makes me the happiest when I watch it. Criticising ppl for their taste in dramas needs to stop because at the end of the day they\u2019re all just made for the enjoyment and pleasure of all of us and putting pressure on ppl to watch other \u201cbetter\u201d dramas or pressuring them to like certain dramas over others is really really toxic and needs to stop. In saying that...Netflix hurry up and drop love alarm season two pls hahahahaa",

People use the \"guilty pleasure\" right and left the moment a book is all about romance and smut, and  when it doesn't have really a plot or amazing world-building in fantasy.\n\nI used to say it some years ago a lot, but I just realized that I don't like that term at all. \n\nIf you like clich\u00e9 and cheesy, that's cool! You are not guilty of anything. Say it out loud! \n\nBesides, this is another matter altoghether, but I think that as of today, almost everything is clich\u00e9. There is rarely anything that can be considered \"totally new\", but people usually use the \"clich\u00e9\" term in a negative way with things they associate with \"kid's shows\",  \"easy plots\",  \"girl-teenager things\" and stories they consider inferior to their tastes overall.",

And unfortunately, most of the time, cliched shows are usually the popular ones. I think we should step out of our comfort zones and watch shows that challenge us to think a little deeper sometimes.

TKEM wasn't 10/10, had plenty of flaws and I wouldn't even rewatch it but ... it also was an amazing experience that I'll always remember fondly (how I literally couldn't wait for the next episode, the lead couple, the story being one of my favorite themes, those ridiculous yet strangely beautiful slow-mo scenes, the OST I kept listening to over and over weeks after I finished it, those scenes that gave me goosebumps or left me a wreck, how I was rooting for some characters, the time spent betweeen episodes speculating about what was coming next, reading discussion threads and getting impressed by how clever other watchers were, etc).",

The stats released by Netflix for 2020 specifically stated it only counted shows that debuted on Netflix in 2020 (Jan. up to Nov. 2020 iirc).",

Watching new shows can be difficult for me bc of my struggles with anxiety, especially if I fall in love with characters and idk if something bad will happen to them. It\u2019s comforting for me to be able to predict future events because it eases my anxiety of not knowing what to expect. True Beauty is one of my favorite romance dramas (I\u2019m currently on episode 8), and yes it\u2019s full of cliches but it\u2019s comforting to me bc I can kind of predict what\u2019ll happen to the characters. \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly okay if ppl don\u2019t like dramas with cliches, but to crap on people who like those things is just childish. Cliches also kind of give dramas a fairy tale like feeling, and I also like that because I use media as an escapism from my mental health. I don\u2019t like seeing people hate on things I like so I often leave my interests off of social media so I don\u2019t have to deal with people being mean over things as useless as a cliche drama. I also feel like cliches work for a reason. I mean a lot of people, including myself, love a classic enemies to lovers story-\n\nI wish guilty pleasures didn\u2019t have to exist, bc no one should feel guilty that they like something.

I think those posts that criticize other people's tastes speak more about the posters' lack of social refinement while highlighting the narrow mindset behind it.  Having to drag another person's personal preference down to hype up your own supposed superiority is, quite frankly, a little pathetic &amp; cliche in and of itself.",

I thought it did a great job at depicting the various reactions people have to beauty standards while making a strong case for sympathy and, maybe, a little advocacy.  The show convinced me to be mindful about the topic.\n\nI realize I'm displaying my own sensitivity but it's only a statement of my own feelings:Whenever I see contempt for the FL's \"weakness\" (while simultaneously admitting to not watching the entirety because of it),  it really makes me sad to think that people similar the FL might actually be experiencing some kind of contempt in real life, just for being sensitive about their trauma.\n\nThat's all to say, I agree, MIIGB has a depth.  :-)",

For example, after a long day I don't want to watch anything too serious but would prefer a nice cheesy wholesome drama. Sometimes when I have more free time and less stressed I would invest in something like Sky Castle or such. And just because a drama has a lot of cliche moments doesn't mean that it is not well made. Like I have seen dramas which try to employ cliche moments but are not wellmade so they fail to create the same effects. True Beauty for example despite its cliche moments and light theme is very well made and makes one laugh and feel lighter. On the other hand some other dramas try the same exact cliche moments and fail. These people who criticize shows like true beauty or love alarm I have seen tend to think that \"kdrama\" is a genre as a whole and not that there are multiple genres within the spectrum of kdrama.",

Like the tropes can be as typical as possible, but if they actually give it time for the two leads to develop that kind of behaviors based on the background and values they built and the interactions between them makes sense, a old trope works just fine. An example is, were there build ups that led to the two leads giving up life for each other LOL \n\nIt\u2019s all about that storytelling :) Not about a cliche plot or not. At least for me! Haha",

Current status: 10/24 Completed \n\n**My Current Watch List:** \n\n**Challenge 11.  - Stealer The Treasure Keeper** I'm still on the fence with drama on whether I like it or not but I do like Joo Won's performance so far. \n\n**Challenge 13. - Family the Unbreakable Bond** I'm not sure I'll make it to the end. This drama is terrible. It's only the little girl that has me coming back \n\n**Challenge 15.  - Dr. Cha** I am loving this so much, Jung Hwa is such a delight!\n\n**Challenge 18.  - The Real Has Come!** So I'm officially obsessed with this drama that I'm now getting anxiety on how they would ruin this lovely show. ( I keep getting Young lady and Gentleman flash backs. It started great too then went sideways into the bin). Please kdrama writer-nim don't do this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Completed Watch List:** \n\n**Challenge 02. - Love to Hate You** \n\n**Challenge 05.

It wasn't groundbreaking but was well excuted to feel a little bit different \n\nKokdu 3/10 this drama started off well but then it got so ridiculous. It was all over the place \n\nFamily the Unbreakable Bond so for me the plot is weak and this is made worse with the writing. In this case I thought that the writers should have gone a bit overboard with this since the plot is already clich\u00e9d but instead it's boring. But when you think you're getting too bored, Jang Hyuk is overkill with his acting. His exaggerated performance is driving me nuts.\n\nDr. CHA is such a feel good drama about second chances at life. Yes her mother in law is horrible and her husband is rubbish but watching her free herself from that life is so cathartic. If you do decide to watch you'll want to root for her yourself.",

            "comment": "Wow, time flies when you're watching Kdramas!  I finished three this month, and I have also started three more.  \n\n**Completed:**  \n\n15. Drama With a Multi-Generational Cast: **Our Blues** \u2013 Loved this drama so much!  The ending was incredibly heart-warming and brought so many tears to my eyes.  \n\n17. Drama Where the College Alma Mater of a Character Was a Plot Point: **Can You Deliver Time? 2002** \u2013 After doing a write-up for this drama on the Spotlight on Web Drama post, I felt nostalgic and decided to watch it again.  Surprisingly, it was even better than I remembered it!  While watching, I realized that it solidly fit this challenge.  I wasn't sure what to see for this before, so that works out well!  \n\n33. Long-form Drama: **Father Is Strange** \u2013 I feel a bit self-conscious saying it, but I'm very proud of myself for finishing the long-form challenge this early in the year!  Both other years I did the challenge, I finished the long-form right at the end of the year, and was anxious if I'd finish in time or not.  Anyway, FIS was my first family drama, and I ended up enjoying it a lot!  I didn't love all the plot lines at the end, but the show wrapped everything up in a fulfilling and satisfying way, and the characters won me over from the things that frustrated me.  I'd seen a lot of the actors in other projects before, and it was fun to see them all in one show together.  \n\n**In Progress:**  \n\n**Switch: Change the World 11/16**  \u2013 I took a bit of a break from this one, as I was in the mood for something different, but it pulled me right back in when I started it again!  I'm not sure what exactly is going to happen next and I love that.  \n\n**Start-Up 5/16** \u2013 I know I'm very late to the party on this one, but I've been loving it so far!  I was craving something with that 2020s Kdrama feel like CLOY and IOTNBO.  I don't know how else to describe it, but there's something about the cinematography and story/dialogue in dramas I've seen from that time that feels immersive and compelling to me.  I also finally got some context for the iconic \"Money!\" scene, which was incredibly fun and funny.  Super enjoying this one so far, looking forward to seeing how the story unfolds.  \n\n**Tale of Nokdu 10/16** \u2013 I remember starting this one when I was very new to the Kdrama world.  I ended up dropping it because the plot was too confusing to me at the time.  I started it again recently, and I have no idea what confused me so much!  The first half was so much fun, it seems to be transitioning into political intrigue in the later half.  Because I found the first half to be so hilarious and bingeable, I'm slightly disappointed that it seems like this element is no longer in the story. But I like intrigue as well, so I'm still invested and interested.  \n\n**Inspector Koo 1/12** \u2013 I just barely started this one, but I'm enjoying it so far!  It's fun to see Lee Young-Ae in such a different role from Jewel in the Palace, and I'm interested to see how the mystery plays out.  \n\nIf I end up finishing some of my ongoing dramas and have some room, I'm thinking of starting Painter of the Wind next month.  I really wanted to see it for the before 2010 challenge last year, but I ran out of time and ended up seeing a short one instead.  It's back on Viki now, so it feels like a sign.\n\nAlso, I happened to find a ton of references to other Kdramas in both Father Is Strange and Be Melodramatic (which I finished last month), including a number of references to dramas not commonly referenced in other dramas.  If you're still looking for a drama for this challenge, I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/100ao1l/comment/jfwdng0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) in the challenge thread.",

You and I are the opposite, though, in when we usually choose to watch long-form dramas. I always finish them off at the beginning of a challenge. But I've found that I end up losing so much sleep in the early part of the year. The long-form dramas I've watched end up sucking me in. Year 1 was **FIS**, year 2 was **Once Again.** This year it was **Five Enough**. I think **Father is Strange** was the most addictive for me.",

I actually considered both **Once Again** and **Five Enough** for the challenge this year.  I ended up going with **Father Is Strange** because I knew a lot of the cast from other dramas.  It is incredibly addictive, and I also found it pretty relaxing to watch when I was tired and didn't have a lot of concentration.  Year 1 I didn't start trying to do the challenge until the middle of the year.  That year I saw **Six Flying Dragons**, and finished in December.  Year 2 I think I started the long-form sometime around March?  I went with **Jewel In the Palace**, and after the childhood episodes concluded it felt like a finished story to me.  I also wasn't super drawn in, and waited months waffling between starting the older storyline and picking a different long-form drama.  I ended up giving it a try, and enjoyed the rest of the drama much more than the beginning!  But it took me until November to finish, which was closer than I would have liked.  All the long-forms I've seen have been absorbing.  I truly enjoyed the journey with FIS, and I think I'd like to try another family drama next year as well.",

Before the first challenge I'd seen a number of 16-20 episode dramas with episodes where not much happened, so I expected longer dramas to have even more filler.  I was pleasantly surprised, as I found all the long-forms I've seen to be very well paced and plotted.  It is quite a commitment to start them though!  I do love that the challenge pushes me to try dramas I might not normally start on my own, I ended up really loving a few that I probably never would have started otherwise.",

            "comment": "I wasn't going to participate in the challenge this year because I gave birth in February and I thought I wouldn't have time to watch as many KDramas. Turns out the first few weeks of breastfeeding can be LONG and I had a ton of time to watch KDramas - especially when I needed to stay up in the middle of the night.\n\nI haven't done a check-in yet so here's what I've completed so far (potential challenges that fit in brackets):\n\n2023-01-02: **Growing Season** (1/2/36) - *Subverts a trope* - This was a great short drama! I loved the frank discussions about sex and relationships, and it was refreshing to see a FL that knew what she wanted and didn't care what others thought of her. The friendship was awesome too. They have a scene where one of the FL has to carry and take care of the drunk (lightweight) ML which I thought was a fun twist. Available for free on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoiNzJZ5zGY).\n\n2023-01-07: **You Raise Me Up** (1/9/17/18/23/30/36) - *Title is a direct translation* - Another KDrama that discusses sex and impotency. I actually preferred Growing Season but this one was pretty good too.\n\n2023-03-04: **A Business Proposal** (5/14/21) - *Best OST* - A rewatch for me because my sister really wanted to see it. I enjoyed it more the 2nd time around when I knew what to expect.\n\n2023-03-08: **Love to Hate You** (13?/20?) - *???* - Good turn your brain off type KDrama with some classic tropes. I feel like this one probably fit more challenges but I was too lazy/sleep deprived to look it up when I watched it, and I've since forgotten most of the story. If anyone has more categories this fits, please let me know as it would help me shuffle some challenges around.\n\n2023-03-12: **Fanletter, Please** (10/12) - *Kpop group member* - Watched this for Yoon Park as he was in my first drama *Age of Youth/Hello My Twenties* but ended up counting it towards the idol challenge instead with Choi Soo Young. Enjoyed it a lot, Yoon Park was great as always and the drama was also very short (4 episodes).\n\n2023-03-19: **20th Century Boy and Girl** (1/6/9/24/27) - *Always wanted to watch but have not watched yet* - Classic KDrama style. Its been on my plan to watch list since I started watching KDramas (2017). I think I had found it in one of the recommendation lists for the friends to lovers trope, which is one of my favourites. Solid, enjoyable KDrama.\n\n2023-03-23: **Extraordinary Attorney Woo** (10/17) - *Actor from my first drama* - Finally got around to this one. Watched this for Park Eun Bin, one of my favourite actresses. She was in my first KDrama *Age of Youth/Hello My Twenties* and was amazing in both. She always plays very different characters, which I like. So happy she won the Baeksang Daesang this year!\n\n2023-04-21: **Alchemy of Souls 1&amp;2** (1/9/12/14/21/22/23/26) - *Disguises or false identities* - Also behind in the times on this one. I'm surprised at how much I loved it, and how much it made me laugh because I normally have to be in a pretty specific mood to enjoy a fantasy drama (and I normally never watch sageuks).",

            "comment": "School holidays meant I had more time for dramas this month but I was kind of in a slump and watched a bunch of variety shows and other countries shows instead. Still managed to cross off 5 dramas so I'm pretty happy with my progress - 13/36. \n\n**Completed**\n\n**Twenty Five Twenty One** - Challenge #20 athlete main character - Still a great drama \n\n**Our Blooming Youth** - Challenge 21 (Disguise/False Identity) -  A very slow burn drama, I enjoyed it. \n\n**Love Is For Suckers** (13/16) - Challenge 12 (Choi SiWon of Super Junior) - I really enjoyed this one. I loved the secondary couple\u2019s story and transformation more than the leads. Great for the duel storytelling aspect of the drama and the reality TV program. Fans of Single\u2019s Inferno watch this. \n\n**Trot Lovers** - Challenge 11 (Ji Eun Ji) -  This was a super fun watch. Excellent \nset up but doesn\u2019t quite reach perfection. Makjanesque. Great music and almost adequate levels of Shin Sung Rok. And the child actor was a delight.\n\n**The Eighth Sense** - Challenge 25 (poster) - I inhaled this one this week and it is just a delight. So deliciously angsty followed by the comedown fluff that I needed. Love me a found family, I\u2019ll definitely rewatch this one.   \n\n**In Progress**\n\n**Start Up** (4/16) - challenge 14 (Gaho \u201cRunning\u201d) -  I never thought I would rewatch this one after the mod trauma but my mum selected it so here I go. I did enjoy it the first time round though. \n\n**Kill Me Heal Me** (1/16) - challenge 1 (two mummies) - u/crusader_blue picked this one out for me to watch! The first episode was terrible, but things can only get better. \n\n**The Forbidden Marriage** (4/12) - (challenge TBD) - I am 100% watching this for Kim Young Dae. I don\u2019t know if it will fit any of my remaining challenges but it\u2019s a short sageuk. It feels like it is attempting to bring the Mr. Queen vibes but I don\u2019t know if the writer has the chops to pull it off. Read that the tone is all over the shop but I think I can deal. \n\n**Dr. Romantic 3** (1/16) - (challenge TBD) - nice to be back at Doldam Hospital once again.  \n\n**Up Next**\n\nWork is back this week so these dramas will probably keep me busy for a while. One of my friends was trying to convince me to give **Hotel Del Luna** another go so I will probably give that a shot. Also planning to watch **Black Knight** when that comes out this month. If **Family** is released on D+ outside of Korea, I'll start that too. \n\n---\n\n**Previously**\n\n[**January Check In**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/10pqum7/comment/j6lwj83/)\n\n* **Dr. Park\u2019s Clinic** - #18 dream interpretation \n\n* **Under The Queen\u2019s Umbrella** - #4 WoC Food: Kimchi - (episode 16) \n\n* **Run On** - #6 WoC PPL; Sportswear \n\n[**February Check In**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/11dyi35/comment/jabo12i/)\n\n* **Kairos** - Challenge 8 (Lee Se Young)\n\n[**March Check In**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/127fuw4/comment/jee5pzq/)\n\n* **Crash Course In Romance**- Challenge 16 (Jung Kyung Ho) \n\n* **Doctor Stranger** - Challenge 24 \n\n* **Unlock My Boss** - Challenge 29 (recommended by u/LcLou02) \n\n* **The Glory** - Challenge 22 (Revenge)",

I\u2019d like to replace this with a different show at some point, because I don\u2019t really want to count this separately from part 1, which I used for a different challenge. Waiting for another PPL to catch my eye in something I\u2019m watching.\n* **Military Prosecutor Doberman** (literal translation of the title). This really picked up steam for me midway through and was an engrossing watch. Lots of good action. A couple of little criticisms: it tried too hard to redeem a character I found flatly irredeemable, and later episodes really leaned on a shocking opening scene and then the \u201cX days earlier\u201d mechanism.\n* **Our Blooming Youth** (disguises / fake identities). I found this show aggressively boring and I couldn't tell you what it was about it. I like the characters plenty, and I can\u2019t explain where this went so wrong for me, but it was not for me.\n* **Angry Mom** (revenge). Way more trauma and tragedy than I expected. Kim Hee Sun is a national treasure, but this one was a tough emotional watch.\n\nIn progress (I am clearly failing at my early-in-the-year plan to limit my number of active shows):\n\n* **Extracurricular** (wanted to watch but haven\u2019t). This has been on my on-hold list for ages. I watched one episode back when it came out and it wasn\u2019t the right time for it for me, but I\u2019ve wanted to come back to it and give it another go since.\n* **Gu Family Book** (repeat co-stars).\n* **Bo Ra! Deborah** (fits a previous challenge: as it airs, from 2022 challenge).\n* **Live** (well-known supporting actor).\n* **Under the Queen\u2019s Umbrella** (multigenerational main cast).",

            "comment": "I finished 3 dramas this month, but they were all drama specials lol.\n\n**Completed in April:**\n\n***#9: Drama starring well-known supporting actor:*** **A Bad Family (2017 KBS Drama Special)** Was going to use this for the single-episode drama slot, but once I recognized the dad's face from like....what feels like nearly all of the dramas I've watched (Lee Joon-hyuk!), I had to use it for this one!\n\n***#30: Title is direct translation:*** **You Drive Me Crazy.** Nothing super fancy, but an enjoyable short drama about two friends dealing with complicated feelings in the aftermath of a spontaneous one-night stand. Cohabitation trope, pet hedgehog, Kim Seon-ho! (Though also: When there's eventually a flashback to the one-night stand, the FL is the initiator but also so drunk I was kinda like \ud83d\ude2c. It's not treated as a problem by the characters, but might be a turn-off for some viewers perhaps?)\n\n***#34: Less than 500 watchers on MDL:*** **Kang Deok Sun's Love History**. Story of a girl who accidentally ends up getting involved with the underground resistance movement during the 1920s, starts light and gets heavier as it goes on. Lots of emphasis on female characters and their relationships, which is always nice to see. (It looks like it's over 500 watchers on MDL now, but not all of those are completed watchers!)\n\n**In Progress:**\n\n**Secret Mother (22/36)** (Edit: Just realized 12 hours later I had the title wrong \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)**-** I somehow ended up dropping Legend of the Blue Sea (it just wasn't clicking with me in the moment, idk! \ud83d\ude22) and then really zipping through this random drama that I feel like nobody's heard of lol. Nothing super special, but pretty bingeable and decently plotted so far! Recommended for fans of scheming rich people drama. (Will probably be using this for tteokbokki from the food wheel of chance, but it also hits some other common rich people melodrama-related tropes.)\n\n**Once Again (52/100)** \\- Over the halfway mark! (Long-form drama.)\n\n**Bo Ra! Deborah (6/14) -** Hmm...the first episode of this was very fun and zingy imho, and then they spent a LOT of time on the FL's breakup from her non-ML love interest, which kind of took the energy down and also has taken up a weird amount of runtime for a 14-episode show. Also I don't really like either of the two side pairings so far? But when it's just the FL or just the main couple I still enjoy it. (Yoo In-na won Best New Actress Baeksang.)\n\nCompleted dramas from other months are on [this MDL list that I finally made](https://mydramalist.com/list/3rWaDvm4)!",

New pb, so sitting at 27/36 [MDL](https://mydramalist.com/list/32AaNKOL) I'm moving through the series faster then I thought, I'm having to rethink some of my choices and adjust. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. One or more tropes from the Heirs - **Cinderella and the Four Knights** \n\n03/08/2023 It was a trope-filled eye roll, but the cast had visuals, and the OST was great. So many plot holes, it got pretty eye-rolly to the end but it wasn't too problematic. I did hate the SFL her character development happened way to late in the series to redeem her. \n\n*tropes hit; abusive parents, anger born of worry, big fancy house, childhood friends, jerk with a heart of gold, has two moms, succession crisis, tsundere, possessive wrist grab.* \n\n6. PPL: Instant Coffee - **One Dollar Lawyer** \n\n04/13/2023 ALL the ppl like ever. but Namgoog was doing the most out-there loved the character and how he could switch both back and forth he was doing a hell of a lot. \n\n*\\*referenced Hot Stove Leauge, ALL the ppl makeup, coffee Starbucks, subway, health supplements, chicken restaurants, an aggressive amount of jajjemong eating*\n\n7. Locations: School - **Duty After School** \n\n04/22/2023 Really liked part 1, but my god there was SO much salt about that ending, I didn't mind it I thought it went with the whole tone of the show. Not everything needs to be a &gt;!happy ending!&lt;.  That post-credit thing though I thought was stupid, it took away all the intent of the bleak ending prior, thought they should have stuck to their guns on that one.\n\n8. Drama with a lead that was a child actor (Yoon Chan Young) - **Delivery Driver**  \n\n04/06/2023 It got really painful towards the end, and the final episode was a mess. There was potential in the characters but the writing is what really let them down here. Side characters were criminally underused. \n\n19. Little to no romance - **Taxi Driver 2** \n\n04/15/2023 I liked the final episode but I didn't find it as punchy as season one, I thought they did stick the landing and I will most likely watch season 3. I just love Lee Ji Hoon. \n\n*\\*could also be used for revenge, secret identities, Namgoong character from One Dollar Lawyer shows up.* \n\n21. Hidden Identities - **Our Blooming Youth** \n\n04/11/2023 I liked that quite a bit, very slow burn, but surprisingly a very sweet ending for all couples. \n\n23. Pet - **Woof &amp; Meow Do You Love Me?**\n\n04/24/2023 Stumbled on this by surprise, but it had no business being so friggin cute. Love Ana and Man-go too so cute the little pet bits.\n\n36. Sereies that firsts a prior year's challenge (2022 Features an LGBTQ+ character) - **The Eighth Sense** \n\n04/26/2023 Outstading KBL, best of the year. Cannot recommend enough, if you've never watched a BL or only plan to watch 1 this should be it. \n\n**In progress** \n\n**11. A Baeksang best new actor - Joo Woo (2012) - Stealer: Treasure Keeper** \n\n**16. Actors with the same zodiac sign - Kang Hoon - Secret Romantic Guesthouse**\n\n**18. Dream interpretation - Bride of Habaek**\n\nStalled on Monster for my long-form.....omg I'm always leaving that one to last.",

I actually didn't complete any kdramas in April, but have made progress on two:\n\n**Mr. Sunshine** (10/24--I'm watching this very slowly!). This one I think I'll use for #14--a drama with an OST by an artist who has been nominated for or won a MAMA award for best OST. Two of the songs in Mr. Sunshine were nominated for best OST in 2017.\n\n**Legend of the Blue Sea** (16/20). This will go for #10--a drama starring one of the actors from your first drama. My first drama was **Boys over Flowers.** I've read some negative reviews of **LOTBS**, but I'm finding the drama enjoyable so far. \n\nIn May, I want to watch **Moment at Eighteen** for challenge 8, a drama with a main lead that started off as a child actor. If I'm up for it, I'll also watch **The Red Sleeve** for challenge 12 (a drama starring an actor who is a member of an active idol group), or, if that will prove too heavy, I might try **Soundtrack #1** instead (especially since that one is short). I do want to watch **The Red Sleeve** at some point, but I just don't know whether now is the time. **Mr. Sunshine** is already heavy.",

Off the top of my head, this fits character seeking revenge, idol actor, trope: amnesia, location: palace, referenced in another drama, work from a writer/director whose works I enjoyed (from the same director as Just Between Lovers!) \n\n**W: Two Worlds** - this was a patchy watch. trope: amnesia, character seeking revenge. \n\n**20th Century Boy &amp; Girl** - classic romcom. food: triangle gimbap, Heirs tropes, subverts trope\n\n**Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo** - I enjoyed this more than I thought I would! Main character is an athlete, title is a direct translation from Korean, food: triangle gimbap, \n\n**The King Eternal Monarch** - the first Lee Minho drama I ever finished. Title is a direct translation from Korean, disguises and false identities, Trope: amnesia, PPL: everything and anything you could think of \n\n**Tale of the Nine-Tailed** - main actor with the same zodiac (Kim Bum, Cancer), lots of dreams (does this count as dream interpretation?), disguises and false identities\n\nI\u2019m currently watching **Glitch** and loving it but not sure yet which challenge it will fit. Any ideas? Also looking to watch **Still 17**.  Does this fit any of the challenges?",

            "comment": "Logging my progress on this year's challenge for the first time! The dramas I had shortlisted for my chosen challenges felt super boring so I abandoned my list and decided to watch whatever and match up later. Though I'd do a check this month - all my shows so far (8 dramas)have gotten slotted...yay!  At this rate, I may be able to hit the Dedicated Watcher level, up one level from last year, with the help of a drama special or two admittedly.  \n\nI however need to be intentional about 2 categories - long form and sageuk(using the challenge to push me out of my comfort zone). \n\nFor long form, not interested in yet another family drama so maybe a daily drama (my first) - something melo-ish. Considering **The Promise** since it stars the fantastic Lee Yoo Ri. Likely to be a makjang, but that's ok. \n\n**Q**: Each episode length is ~35 mins, 102 eps totalling to 59.5 hours, so it does qualify for the challenge, right? \n\nBack up option is My Golden Life, so lets see. As for sageuk, it's gonna be **Bloody Heart**(Lee Joon and Jang Hyuk together!).\n\n\n***Current Status***\n  \n**Completed**  \n\n**Player: Challenge #21(conmen)** :: 8/10    \n\nA fun caper show with witty banter, great cast chemistry and fast paced plotting, just keep aside logic/believability!   \n\n **VIP: Challenge #9 (prominenet supporting actor - Kim Mi Kyung (hacker ajhumma!) or Kang Hyun Sung)**  :: 9/10    \n\nA study of a marriage breaking up due to infidelity - we get a close-up view of the FL's entire emotional journey from discovery to closure. Terrific performance by Jang Nara.  Bonus, two more strong secondary female character arcs. \n\n**King of Pigs: Challenge #22 (revenge)**  ::  9.5/10   \n\nGut wrenching and  compelling. Particularly impressed by Kim Dong Wook here.   \n\n**Justice: Challnge #19 (no romance)**  ::  9/10  \n\nContemplative drama that explores how justice can mean different things to different people. And the price they are willing to pay for it. Son Hyun Joo as usual gives a standout performance but the real discovery was Park Sung Hoon.  \n\n**Love &amp; Law: Challenge #5 (the trope I got - Rich man/Poor woman)**  :: 7.5/10  \n\nFairly interesting set up - the romance plotline worked well until they \"get together\" (has one of my favourite confession scenes). The FL's character faded into the background and  romance lost all punch in the 2nd half as the ML's arc became the focal point, but I enjoyed the show overall. Discovered Lee Sung Jae's gravelly voice, always a win for me.   \n\n\n**Terrius Behind Me: Challenge #16 (zodiac sign - share So Ji Sub's sign, Scorpio)**  :: 9/10  \n\nSuper cute drama - blends action and  romance/slice of life genres well, but need to keep your expectations low when it comes to the thriller plotline. I loved the KIS team and Son Ho Jun's turn as a self-absorbed gray character turning over a new leaf. \n\n**Ongoing**\n\n**The One &amp; Only: Challenge #12 (member of active Kpop group - Joy of Red Velvet)**  (13/16)  \n\n\nSurprised by how good this show turned out to be. I had seen both the leads do well in support roles earlier so gave it a spin, loving both of them here especially Ahn Eun Jin. Mixes melodrama, romance and mystery pretty decently. A bit heavy handed in some places, but to be expected given the topic\n\n**Mouse: : Challenge #30 (direct translation of Korean title)**  (13/20)  \n\nMan, what do I even say about this drama!",

            "comment": "Finished up three dramas this month, meaning I'm at 11/36 *with* my long-form challenge already completed. Actually, I spent the better part of this entire month in a kdrama hangover after finishing my rewatch of **Lie After Lie** at the beginning of the month so I've been binging variety shows mostly (caught up on 1N2D and finished Peak Time). This week I've finally gotten back to watching kdramas by binging all ten episodes of **Duty After School** and now I think I'm back into a kdrama hangover *again*.\n\n###Completed\n\n**Delivery Man** Sweet and earnest drama that gave me a bit of happiness each week despite nothing about it being groundbreaking or exceptional. I really enjoyed the little story arcs of the ghosts and though the Big Bad^TM was a bit predictable and underwhelming, the acting and emotional buildup of the moments *still* got me. I actually really enjoyed the noona romance for this one because it felt earnest and lovely though very chaste.\n\n*Challenges:* **8 (Yoon Chan Young)** | 26 (Show Window\u2019s Director/Writer)\n\n**Lie After Lie** (Rewatch) I had a pretty bad drama hangover the first time I watched this when it aired. I think my hangover on this rewatch has lasted *longer* because this round I knew the plot developments so the sense of urgency to find out what happens *next* was gone, instead I indulged in letting my emotions essentially spiral out of control. Easily one of my favorite melodramas and definitely one of the dramas where (the good) characters show the most maturity. \n\n*Challenges:* 4 (Tteokbokki, ice cream) | 5 (it\u2019s so pretty Ep. 4) | 15 | **16 (Yeon Jung Hoon 1978 Year of Horse)** | 22\n\n**Duty After School** Enjoyed it lots, including the ending, which I thought was actually fitting for the overall theme and tone of the drama. There are dramas where HEA type of endings are expected because of genre and narrative conventions and then there are dramas that establish pretty early on the 'tone' of its intended ending. Picked this up for Shin Hyun Soo and he definitely did great in it but ultimately, it was the high school students that really got to me. A few of them were a bit on the green side but overall, excellent performances. \n\n*Challenges:* 19 (Was too lazy to look up other ones so might shuffle this one around)\n\n###Currently Watching\n\n**Queen of Masks** (2/16) Makjang drama starring Kim Sun Ah *and* Yoo Sun? I am so watching! First two episodes were great so I'm hopeful I can continue and this won't end up like **Pandora** where the writing was too clumsy and heavy-handed.\n\n###Previously\n\n[**MDL Challenge List**](https://mydramalist.com/list/LOP9gBP3)\n\n[**January**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/10pqum7/comment/j6pls6h/)\n\n**20th Century Boy and Girl** (Rewatch)  1 (Childhood Friends; Drowning My Sorrows) | 4 (**Tteokbokki**, also Fried Chicken, Jajangmyeon, Kimchi, Hoe, Jeon) | 9 (Kim Mi Kyung &amp; Kim Chang Wan) | 30 | 31\n\n[**February**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/11dyi35/comment/jadkais/)\n\n**Decoy/Bait S1** 4 (Jjajangmyeon) | 9 | 13 (Heo Sung Tae &amp; Yoo Sung Joo) | 19 | 26\n\n**KAIROS** (Rewatch) 1 (Run away holding hands, wrist grab) | 4 (Fried Chicken, Samgak Gimbap) | 5 (Childhood Connection) | 6 (car) | 7 (Hotel) | 8 &amp; 11 (Lee Se Young)\n\n**M** 2 (woman put handkerchief down for man to sit in Ep 3) | 5 (amnesia) |\u00a0**34**\u00a0(I'm 35th completed watcher) | 35\n\n[**March**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/127fuw4/comment/jeeyo1v/)\n\n**Temptation of Wife** 1 (Abusive Parents) | 3 | 5 (rich/poor couple) | 8 (Jang Seo Hee) | 15 | 21 | 22 | 24 | 26 (Kim Soon Ok) | **33** | 35\n\n**Dream High** (Rewatch) 2 (guy gets short haircut after heartbreak) | 4 (Jjajangmyeon) | 12 (2PM) | 13 (IU &amp; Kim Soo Hyun) | **14 (IU)** | 35\n\n**Island** 6 (car | restaurant) | 11 (Kim Nam Gil) |\u00a0**25**\n\n**Kokdu: Season of Deity** 2 (FL piggybacks ML, ML does not touch sleeping FL\u2019s face) | 4 (kimchi, ice cream, fried chicken) | 5 (childhood connection) | **17** | 26 (writers) | 31",

            "comment": "A few of my other obsessions and a cold resurfaced this month so I didn't spend much time watching kdrama. I just checked and, luckily, I am still on track to make chaebol! We are 1/3 of the way through the year and I recently finished my 12th drama.\n\nFinished in April:\n\n**Fated to Love You** \\- a rewatch of my first drama! 10/10 for opening me up to the world of kdramas, 10/10 for cast, 9/10 for not having annoying parental figures, 7/10 for pacing because the second half drags, and 11/10 for every Lee Gun laugh.  I was rushing to rewatch all 20 episodes before the premiere of **Family** with the same leads. but ha, that didn't end up mattering. I can't find a place to watch **Successful Story of a Bright Girl** either, so this might have to be my **Challenge 13**. I want to discuss the trope subversion I picked: Lee Gun's grandmother is obsessed with him getting a girl pregnant so they can have an heir for their conglomerate. I picked this as a subverted trope because I think it's very unusual for a parent figure in a modern-era drama to be this encouraging of sex outside of marriage. In sageuks this is a common plotline for kings and crown princes to need to produce an heir quickly, and Gun's grandmother being called Madame Wang (King), shows the intentional reference to palace style family dynamics. I just thought that was interesting! \n\nOther challenges: 1 (birth secrets, no father, abusive parent), 2 (grandma needs a grandbaby, drinking with FIL), 9 (Song Ok Soon), 11 (Jang NaRa), 13, 14 (Ailee), 23, 36 (OST by a cast member). FOOD: Kimchi, Hoe/Sashimi TROPE: amnesia, rich/poor couple, study abroad. PPL: home appliance? floor cleaning robots LOCATION: Park, mansion, hotel, restaurant, cafe, bridge.\n\nIn progress:\n\n**My Father is Strange** (35/50) - My longform drama, I'm 2/3 of the way done! Honestly not loving this one as much as **Once Again** or, if my memory 4 years ago can be trusted, **Five Enough.** Some of the characters are too annoying and I can tell that when the Big Secret gets out (&gt;!the Father is living under a stolen identity!&lt;) it is going to be really dramatic. At least in Once Again the big secret was something good to look forward to. So, I would recommend **Once Again** to anyone still deciding what to watch as a long form drama!\n\n**The Forbidden Marriage** (6/12) - I am really enjoying this one! It is a gorgeous sageuk that is not worried about being believable so there is space for jokes and references to dramas (Heirs, Goblin, My Love from the Star, Descendants of the Sun, Hotel Del Luna, Sky Castle). It has a youth fantasy/romance vibe with a plucky young woman teaming up with two handsome, powerful men (that, of course, are in love with her) to like, save the world - aka - let people get married and maybe solve a murder. It got more serious in episode 6 so I am curious to see if I will enjoy the second half as much. Watching this for challenge 21, false identities or disguises.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have not been watching anything on air since **Crash Course in Romance** ended. If anybody has some on-air recs that are light and fun and could work for the challenge let me know!",

The story is overall enjoyable, although not that surprising.\n\n*(#12 Current Idol Actor)* **Island** (Cha Eun Woo): One of my most anticipated shows but a major disppointment. Sadly no horror, a very messy story with cliches, a terrible action scenes and editing. It had an interesting worldbuilding that was sadly barely used. The best things were the actors. Heard not so good things about Cha Eun Woo, but he was very solid (and his character the most interesting and best written), and ofc it had Kim Nam Gil. Thanks for that at least.\n\n*(#13 Co-Stars on Multiple Occasions)* **Taxi Driver 2**: Didn't like the first season, really liked this one. The villains were interesting and the cases had a lot of heart and fun. Best part was &gt;!On Ha Jun's overall story. so sad T__T !&lt;\n\n*(#23 Featuring a Pet)* **Missing: The Other Side 2**: Heartwarming stories, love the characters and how they evolved. The production is good, especially the dreamy and whimsical cinematography of the ghost town. Even corrected some flaws of season 1 (eg. Jong A's agency....)\n\n*(#34 Less than 500 Watchers)* **The King of the Desert**: Was no. 198 after completion. Very interesting absurdist take on work and how it effects life. Explores what people would do for money in an interesting way. Amusing due to the dark humour. The episodic nature made some episodes stronger than others.\n\n*In-Progress*\n\n*(#9 Supprting Actor)* **Stealer: the Treasure Keeper (4/12)** (Jo Han Chul): Very fun romp so far. The characters are quirky and fun, slowly coming together to build a good team, the setting regarding the cultural artifacts is something new and different, the villains are a credible threat so far. \n\n*(#22 Revenge)* **Payback: Money and Power (3/12)**: I like the setup so far, sadly due to time constraints I had to take a little break.\n\n*(#33 Long Form Drama)* **Queen Seon Deok (5/62)**: The inciting incident is finished and all the players are starting their hero's journey (or villain downfall). Good characters so far, and an interesting story and politics. It still can be a bit confusing due to the amount of characters, but with a bit more watching I think it will be okay.\n\nCompleted 5/36. Like I said: A very chill watch :)",

There are so many subverted tropes here as each episode ends on a quid pro quo. Totally recommend !!!\n\nStrong Woman Do Bong Soo (#3) : I saw it referenced in The Light in your eyes's first episode. I don't know why I had never given this drama its chance before but it was a good opportunity for this challenge. I enjoyed this light hearted romcom even though I would have to disagree with those saying it's one of the best dramas ever. It still was a cute watch.\n\nCall it Love (#5 ends up at a playground after a few drinks) : This gave me My liberation notes kind of vibes. Both the leads are looking for something to make their life happier and it's really hard for them. The light and cinematography are really good in this one. I really liked it.\n\nSummer Strike (#11) : I loved this one. The journey of the FL, the ML who's one of the greenest flags ever, the slow paced romance, I loved everything about it. My best watch of the month !\n\nTaxi Driver 2 (#25) : Even though I liked season 1 better, this still was a fun drama to watch. Lee Je Hoon is such a versatile actor ! I'm looking forward to season 3 now !\n\nOur Blooming Youth (#26. Jung Hyun Jung was also the screenwriter of Lovestruck in the city and Romance is a bonus book) : it was an enjoyable drama but not one of the best I've seen. I enjoyed the side characters more than the main. Some of the episodes feeled dragged when the end seemed rushed. Probably one of those dramas that won't stay in kdrama history...\n\nAnna (#30) : This one was unexpectedly good. I really liked Suzy's performance and I thought the writing was well done.   \n\n\nThis month's list is big but as I watched airing dramas, they just happened to finish in April.  \nAll in all, I've seen 19 dramas so far for the challenge,more than half.   \nLet's go for the remaining 17 !!!",

She would never know (trope: disposable fianc\u00e9e) \n\nOk drama overall. I neither disliked nor liked it. Rowoon was honestly my favorite part. The fl win me back over a little bit (I really disliked her in melting me softly)\n\n-19. Taxi driver 2 (minimal romance). I thought it was pretty good. Not as emotionally invested this time around, but still very solid. It was funny because I planned to use this to meet the minimum romance challenge, but found myself rooting for Kim Do Gi to get with Ahn Go Eun. Was it me, or was there flirting &gt;!flirting when they were in the rooftop together at the end? I was tired!&lt;\n\n-22. Call it love (seeking revenge). I really liked it which surprised me because slow paced dramas aren\u2019t my usual cup of tea. Also became a big fan of Kim young kwang. Actually, I was watching clips of him off YouTube and discovered beat coins that way. \n\n-28. Weak hero class 1 (inspired by a review). It was so good and I\u2019m glad I listened to the reviewer.",

            "comment": "This is my first KDrama Challenge, so I'm surprised that I've made any progress at all! But overall, it's been really fun and a great way to step out of my comfort zone.\n\n***Completed***\n\n1. **Love to Hate You - Number 2: Drama that subverts a trope.** There are quite a few tropes that this drama subverts, but I think my favorite is the emphasis on how many relationships the female lead has had. &gt;!It was somewhat interesting that the show kept emphasizing that Mi-ran had at least 100 previous relationships, when other dramas I've watched like to play up the female leads complete lack of experience with romantic relationships.!&lt;\n2. **Weak Hero Class 1 - Number 7: I spun a school for my location.** Love, love, loved this drama. I initially watched it because of Shin Seung Ho, but every member of the cast did an amazing job. I loved this drama so much that I hope there's a second season, &gt;!I need to see how Si-Eun adapts to his new school!&lt;\n3. **Summer Strike - Number 12: a drama starring an actor who is a member of a Kpop group.** Yim Siwan is a member of ZE:A, so I feel justified in watching this drama. I ultimately have mixed emotions about this drama, I wish it focused more on the healing and self-discovery aspect of the show, as opposed to the \"other\" plotline. Great acting, but the writing fell a little flat for me.\n4. **Alchemy of Souls (Season 2) - Number 16: a drama with an actor that shares your zodiac sign.** Shin Seung Ho is a scorpio, much like myself. With regards to this drama, I once again had mixed emotions &gt;!I actually liked the relationship between the leads, but way to much time was given to the amnesia plot. I also felt that the female lead was stripped of much of her agency, and was forced to constantly wait for Uk or someone else to save her. If season 1 did not have such a powerful, self-determined female lead ( a la Mudeuk), Naksu's character might not have felt as jarring. Additionally, totally missed opportunity with constructing Jin Mu's character. He could have been a compelling villain if the writers developed his character (i.e., backstory, and evil motivations) much more. The entire show, I had no clear idea what was pushing Jin Mu to pursue the power he was after, the drama skimmed the surface, but never went deep enough for it to matter.!&lt;\n5. **The Glory (Parts I and II) - Number 22: a drama with a character seeking revenge.** Great show, great acting, absolutely haunted by the bullying, and never watched a show that made me as angry as this one. This was my first Song-Hye Ko watch, and I think she did a fantastic job, she seemed absolutely (and rightfully) unhinged throughout the entire show! Also, if you haven't watched them already, Netflix Korea has a few videos where the actors, writer, and director discuss some of the prominent scenes of the show. It was really cool to see what the writer was thinking about when constructing some of the show's scenes.\n6. **Review Notebook of My Embarrassing Days - Number 23: a drama with at least one animal pet.** I have no shame saying that I watched this solely because of Jeon Somin. As an avid Running Man watcher, it was nice to see Somin act! Also, I just realized that the male lead is Jae-Joon from the Glory... no wonder he felt so familiar.\n7. **Welcome to Waikiki - Number 24: a drama I've always wanted to watch.** This drama has been haunting me for years, so I finally decided to watch it. I have to say, I loved it! Aside from some of the character flaws, and my personal distaste for certain aspects of &gt;!Dong-gu and Yoon-ah's relationship!&lt; I generally enjoyed this show!\n8. **Our Blues - Number 26: a drama from a writer who's other works I've enjoyed.** This drama is officially my favorite drama ever. I thoroughly enjoyed how this show approaches the complexities of human relationships and emotions, as well as the various difficulties we all face as we navigate our everyday lives. I just love this show sooo much, each character is developed with care (even the side characters), it leaves you feeling connected to every member of the cast! Side note, the writer for this drama also wrote Live (2018), which I also enjoyed.\n9. **Bride in Sneakers - Number 32: a single episode drama.** I don't have much to say about this...\n10. **The Expiration Date of You and Me - Number 34: a drama with less than 500 watchers on MDL.** This drama was short and sweet. &gt;!I don't like the best friend though, I don't like the way he went about confessing his feelings for the FL!&lt;\n\n***In Progress***\n\n1. **Life on Mars (Number 30) -** I'm about 9 episodes in, and have been thoroughly enjoying this drama!\n2. **When the Devil Calls Your Name (Number 19) -** I wanted to watch another Jung Kyung Ho drama, but this has been placed in the backseat until I finish LoM.\n3. **Uncle (Number 9) -** I think I'm around 4 episodes in. It's pretty great so far, but I haven't been keeping up. (Also, I'm specifically watching this for Oh Jung Se).\n4. **The Heirs (Number 35) -** TWO EPISODES LEFT. I did not think I would make it this far, but I have a question, am I actually supposed to like Kim Tan? I just cannot find the will to like his character, but the same cannot be said for Yeong-Do...",

Jun-wan and Ik-Soon had jjm during one of their dates.\n\n9\\] A drama starring a well known supporting actor\n\n* ***Alchemy Of Souls*** \\- I picked 2022's favorite chingu, Seo Hye-won. I love her and I hope to see her on more shows.\n\n15\\] A drama with a multigenerational main cast\n\n* ***Under The Queen's Umbrella*** \\- There were three generations in the main cast plus a fourth in the support.\n\n21\\] A drama featuring disguises or false identities\n\n* ***The Forbidden Marriage*** \\- FL was using a different identity for her safety after an attempt on her life.\n\n24\\] A drama you always wanted to watch but for some reason have not watched yet\n\n* ***Descendants Of The Sun*** \\- Since I only got into Kdramaland during lockdown, I never had the chance to watch this before but I wanted it out of the way before I watch *Reborn Rich* and *The Glory*.

Looove them!\n\n28\\] A drama inspired by a review, recommendation or comment on r/KDRAMA or r/kdramarecommends\n\n* ***Romance Is A Bonus Book*** \\- This is my most recent watch--I posted [a prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramarecommends/comments/12xeaxt/need_more_dramas_with_a_happy_ever_after/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) a few days ago and this got reco'ed three times!\n\n36\\] A drama which fits a challenge from previous KDC years\n\n* ***Love To Hate You*** \\- I picked *theme 11: A drama featuring great friendships* from KDC 2021 since I loved the bromance of the ML and the SML.\n\nNine shows done! No pressure at all. Hahaha! No, I seriously am feeling the pressure because I wanna get to chaebol level. There are some really difficult themes. But that's the fun in challenges, right?\n\nI have nothing parked for now but torn between starting *D.P.* or *Bad Prosecutor* or find myself another rom-com.\n\nEdit: Fixed numbers.",

But it can be used to #21 disguises and #22 revenge\n\n**True to Love / Bora! Deborah** \\- I am liking this show so far. I am just not sure where this would go. \n\nI am not sure I will start many dramas in May. My goal is just to finish the ones I have.",

Though I had secondhand embarrassment for FL several times\n\n- **Agency** - really good drama, I studied advertising in uni, so it was quite interesting to watch. My fave character is mom SFL, she was so good and the fact her family was really supportive was refreshing\n\n- **Oasis** - it was really heavy drama but I liked it! I started to watch it because FL, and she was so good. Final episode made really nervous, I didn't feel something like because of a drama for a while\n\n**In progress**:\n\nDong Yi\n\nCall it Love",

I seem to be the type of person who either LOVES a drama or hates it. There is no inbetween for me lol. \r  \n\r  \n**Completed:**\r  \n\r  \n**The Heavenly Idol** \\- (Challenge #31 A drama with an episode which received less than 2% overall viewership rate from Nielsen) \r  \nI really enjoyed this one. It was the perfect light watch I needed.\r  \n\r  \n**Our Blooming Youth** \\- 14/20 (Challenge #21 A drama featuring disguises or false identities)\r  \nI am so glad I waited to watch the last 4 episodes together. I loved this drama was sad to finish it.\r  \n\r  \n**The K2** (Challenge #5.h A drama chosen by the Wheel of Chance: Tropes - Can only cook ramyeon)\r  \nMy expectations were super low before I started it. It's been on my list for a year and I kept putting it off thinking I would hate it. In fact I loved it. I think I liked it more than Healer... which is surprising? I keep thinking about it... have been tempted to rewatch it.\r  \n\r  \n**Oasis** (Challenge #13 A drama where two of the main or support cast have been co-stars on multiple occasions)\r  \nI just finished this yesterday. Was such a great great drama. Jang Dong Yoon just has this ability to make me love every single drama he's in (and his characters). \r  \n\r  \nAlso completed:\r  \nDivorce Attorney Shin and Taxi Driver 2 but haven't found anyway to include them in my challenges.\n\n\r  \n**Ongoing:** \r  \n\r  \n**Joseon Lawyer - A Morality** \\- 8/16 (Challenge #26 A drama from a screenwriter or director whose works you have previously enjoyed) \r  \n\r  \n**The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim** \\- 1/12 (Challenge #1 A drama that has one or more tropes that are used in The Heirs)\r  \n\r  \n**Romantic Doctor Kim** \\- 2/21 (Challenge #27 A drama found by searching existing recommendations) \r  \n\r  \n**Bora! Deborah** \\- 1/14 (Challenge #11 A drama starring an actor who has previously won the Baeksang best new actor or actress award) \r  \n\r  \n**Warrior Baek Dong Soo** \\- 1/29 (Challenge #35 A drama that is at least 10 years old)\n\nI also dropped King2Hearts. I found myself getting so angry and worked up watching it... and I had to force myself  to watch each ep. I think my gut instinct to drop it in the first ep was the right choice for me. There were too many things that bothered/annoyed me about it. I may continue it one day... but I highly doubt it.\n\nIn May... I'll finish my upcoming dramas and also hopefully not start too many new dramas. Although there a ton of new dramas I want to watch but have been waiting for more eps to be out.",

            "comment": "This is my first check in because I only started with this challenge in April. I came across this challenge because this is my first year I\u2019m seriously studying Korean. This challenge is a great way to help me when I don\u2019t feel like studying hardcore but casual. It helps with my listening skills. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m doing everything right, so please feel free to correct me if some kdramas don\u2019t fit the challenge I used it for! I\u2019m also not sure yet about what and what not to put in spoilers. And since I\u2019m still a newbie in the kdrama world I\u2019ll skip the reviews aspect a little. I\u2019m way behind obviously, but last month went better than expected! I\u2019m very excited to see how far next month will bring me in this challenge. Also if anyone have recommendations, please share with me. I didn\u2019t watch too many kdramas yet. \n\n**Completed:**\n\n-Challenge 1: **vincenzo**: this was a nice way to start the challenge and I loved this kdrama, but it could\u2019ve been a little bit shorter for me personally. \n\n-challenge 2: **dodosolsollalasol** this was fun to watch especially after **vincenzo**. I could use a break after all the violence. This drama had me so intrigued, especially the last few episodes. \n\n-challenge 3: **our beloved summer**: this was fine for me to watch, I did like it but not absolutely loved it like some other dramas. Maybe because a lot of things happening, were expected already.\n\n-challenge 4: **hometown chachacha**: I enjoyed this drama and I think the ML, Kim Seonho, is starting to become one of my favorite actors. Really liked him in start-up too. I also loved the FL. I enjoyed seeing how their chemistry kept developing.\n\n-challenge 5: **business proposal**: this was my most favorite kdrama of this month. The little love triangles? The pushing away and pulling back to each other. I could go on and on, but like I said I\u2019m not too sure about spoilers yet. Loved the plot and 10/10 recommend. But I think everyone here already watched this one haha\n\n-challenge 16: **soundtrack #1**: So I was surprised with this kdrama, because I wasn\u2019t aware there are also short kdramas like this. It was very nice to change it up a little, after all the long watches. The plot was pretty cute!\n\n\n\n**Watching:**\n\n-**big mouth**: I started off liking this drama a lot. But I have to say I feel a bit bored with it now. I just can\u2019t exactly figure out why. \n\n-**reply 1994**: Ive only watched 1 episode so far, but I\u2019m very curious to see where it\u2019s going. I think this is my first \u201colder\u201d drama that I\u2019m watching. \n\n-**hwarang**: this is an unexpected watch and I didn\u2019t even think I would like it, because I don\u2019t like historical plots. But I absolutely love it and will finish next month. If anyone know which challenges I can use this for, please let me know!\n\n-**its okay to not be okay**: I\u2019m loving this so far, might be my new favorite kdrama for next month. I\u2019m so impressed with some of the patients.",

As a love story it is more of a forced coupling, and as a drama it is ... well, OK I guess, but the really good thing is that the language is so easy. I use an app to get double subs on Netflix, and I feel that after watching this drama my Korean level really jumped up. For A1/A2 level. \n\nAnd some advice from a seasoned watcher: Don't be afraid of dropping dramas that are not for you ( [Mountaineering rule nr 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/tw59gs/safety_rules/) ). The challenges are so flexible this yyear, it should be easy to find another drama that fits that particular challenge. Hope you have fun!",

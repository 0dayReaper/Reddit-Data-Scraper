            "comment": "**The Good Bad Mother** (2/14): I went into this series with high expectations based on director Shim Na-yeon\u2019s impressive track record, and the powerful cast. The first two episodes delivered in a big way. \n\nEpisode 1 packed a great deal of narrative progress into a single episode, from Kang-ho\u2019s tragic upbringing, to the group of villagers that played an influential role in his development, and of course his problematic relationship with his domineering mother. \n\nEpisode 2 continued to lay the groundwork by introducing the tangled web of relationships that Kang-ho has insinuated himself into in the present day as a prosecutor. It concluded with a defining moment from which the main storyline will begin in earnest from the next episode.",

It does indeed have those heavy, emotionally searing scenes, but it also has quirky, whimsical \"interludes\" between the heavy scenes (the supporting cast of villagers provide the comic relief.) I think the tone will continue to alternate between these extremes for the rest of the series. I would recommend watching the first episode, and judging whether it's too heavy or not based on that.",

New actors, new writers+directors, low budget.....and yet the end product is so wholesome and impactful. Can't wait to see what these talented people come up with next. 10/10 Stars\n\n**Call It Love** (16/16) - Found the last two episodes the weakest. &gt;!The mother-resolution was too drawn out and the 1-year time skip was unnecessary IMO. I wanted a better reunion than the one we got. And it would have been nice to see how they were once they got together.!&lt; But the show is a solid 8.5/10 for me in its entirety. \n\n**The Devil Judge** (16/16) - What a cracky watch! I binged it in only 3 days. Ji-Sung is HOT!! Plus his performance gave so much gravitas to an over the top set-up. All the other performances were strong too, especially Kim Min-Jung - never before have I rooted for the villain to end up romantically with the hero. 9/10 Stars\n\n(Thailand) **Bed Friend** (10/10) - Started spicy and fluffy but turned into trauma porn halfway into the runtime. The last couple of episodes brought back the spice and fluff but the middle part still left a bad taste. Net and James carried this one and I hope their upcoming show together does justice to their amazing chemistry. 6.5/10 Stars\n\n**Watching:-**\n\n**Bo Ra Deborah / True To Love** (6/14) - The first couple of episodes were meh but the show got better from the 3rd episode. For a romcom it is showing very real after effects of a break up. &gt;!Bo Ra's self-pity party did go on for too long but it was interspersed with interesting interactions with the ML. The show shines when they are together. They have already gone from enemies to friends, and now that Bo Ra has got herself together, I look forward to their relationship developing from friends to lovers. I hope the relationship between the CEO and the Intern remains platonic though.!&lt;\n\n**Once Again** (40/50) - This is my comfort show that I am watching slowly so that it lasts a longer time.\n\n(Thailand) **A Boss And A Babe** (9/12) - Continues to be sweet fluff and I'm thankful that it's keeping the angst on the low. Sometimes you just want to watch two nice people being sincerely in love without the whole world conspiring to keep them apart.\n\n**Love Affairs In The Afternoon** (2/16) - This is a 2019 show that dropped on Viki recently. Picked it up for Lee Sang Yeob who I'm loving in Once Again. It's adapted from a Japanese show and its Japanese roots are very apparent. Will watch another couple of episodes before deciding if I'm going to continue or drop.",

I must admit just and extra 5-10 minutes at the end with them together would have made it perfect.\n\nBased on your recommendations I will give Once Again a try.",

I'm in love with The Eighth Sense and will definitely rewatch it soon. \n\nOnce Again is a 50-episode family drama. It's my second favorite long family show after My Father Is Strange. However, since it's a long show and has a lot of characters, it takes some time setting everything up. So the first few episodes may feel like a drag and also one or two episodes later on.

            "comment": "Completed:\n\n* **Romance is a Bonus Book (16/16)** \u2014 What a great drama. It made me feel so good on the inside. I can see this being a comfort show for me. The characters are lovable, and the creators really fleshed them out. Both the leads and both the second leads were so good that I didn't care who ends up with who, as long as they're all happy. In some dramas, they make the second leads so unbearable that you can't handle their presence on screen. Not this one. There is not a single character I despised from the bottom of my heart, either. And, bonus, there are no villains in this drama! Great watch. My only critique is that the first episode didn't hook me. The ones after, though, were right up my alley. 8.5/10. I highly recommend it.\n\nCurrently Watching:\n\n* **The Good Bad Mother (2/14)** \u2014 I expected heartbreak going into this, and, well, I got it. Yet, it's so well done. The first episode was a solid pilot, and the second episode was intriguing and mysterious with the information they give us. It left the viewers with questions, and I already see people theorizing what might happen. The main plot hasn't even happened and there's already a lot that I'm curious about. On another note, the leads are insanely talented. Ra Mi Ran and Lee Do Hyun are great on screen, and I can't wait to see how the plot goes.\n* **Joseon Attorney (10/16)** \u2014 My goodness, this drama. Seriously, each week, it has its great moments. Woo Do Hwan's portrayal of his character and the way he shows his emotions - talent! It tips the drama in a favorable direction for me, even though the drama has its flaws, like the way the FL and 2ML behave. I can't with them. I can't root for them as individuals (for the FL, I only root for the romance, really, since they're cute). The ML, however, is so easy to root for. He's so charismatic and sweet. And these past few weeks, they've made it hard to wait for next week's episodes because the episodes end on a high note. Can Saturday come faster?\n* **Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha (7/16)** \u2014 I'm kinda sad I have to watch this drama at a slow pace, but I'm also glad. I get to savor every bit of it. I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said about the drama. I'm enjoying it a lot, and I'm glad I have more than half of the drama left to watch. Hurray!\n* **She Was Pretty (4/16)** \u2014 This drama isn't really for me, but there is one thing I really love. The 2ML. He has my heart. I am rooting for his happiness, and I will watch purely for him. I also realized that when I finish this, it'll be my first completed Park Seo Joon drama. How? Have I been living under a rock this whole time? This isn't the first time I see him in anything. I've even completed a (terrible) movie with him as the lead, but this will be the first drama of his I'll finish. Yay for progress!\n\nAlso watched **Suspicious Partner** episode 12/20 without actively paying attention. I gotta say, it's better than when it first started. Just not into the drama, really. Also watched **She Would Never Know** episode 5, and this is as uninteresting to me as when I first watched it. I didn't put these into the 'currently watching' category, either, cause I'm watching at a really slow pace. I might finish in 2 years, who knows.\n\nOn a more positive note, I recently watched the episode of **I Live Alone** that Woo Do Hwan was in, which is his first variety show appearance. Wild! What a great first appearance, though, because my goodness is this man adorable IRL. Oh, and his friendship with Lee Sang Yi. I couldn't handle it. WDH is already my kdrama bias (or bias in general, really ... not gonna lie), and now I've melted after watching that episode.",

It\u2019s ok overall. Nothing to really talk about. \n\nI will have to check out the WDH episode.",

I'm going to start my second (much more slow) rewatch next week when I share it with my long-distance drama-watching friend. It's just so good.\n\nWe have one more watching session to see the last 2 episodes of **Gu Family Book.** I remembered that I loved it, but had forgotten so much of its wisdom. It's an older drama, so there are a few scenes that seem \"dated,\" but it's a solid 10/10 for me still. It's a wonderful Tale that includes these tidbits of amazing life wisdom. Magic, romance, action, politics, lovely music - it's the whole package for me. And Lee Seung Gi and Suzy are wonderful in it. Choi Jin Hyuk has never looked more beautiful. \n\nStarted **The Good Bad Mother**  and I think it's going to be very good. I enjoyed the first 2 episodes. I love to see Lee Do Hyun is one the best young actors so I'm excited to see how he plays this.\n\nI began **My Perfect Stranger** and **Bo Ra**  and will probably watch them. Waiting for **The Nine Tailed 1938**  and a few others. From the comments here, I might watch **Call it Love** or **The Eighth Sense.**",

So far, It has been entertaining enough for me to continue, but do not feel very attached to this show. \n\n\n**The Heirs** (16/20) I have been watching this show slowly, mostly when I feel tired after work. It relaxes my mind for some reason. Besides, It has the oddest framing that I find so amusing.\n\n\n**The Good Bad Mother** (2/14) This one was a pleasant surprise. I wasn't that crazy about the description, but after some good feedback, I gave it a try and I loved it! I don't know if it continues being good, but, in any case, the initial episodes are definitely worth watching. \n\n\n**Navillera** (4/12) Because I wanted more of **The Good Bad Mother**, but \"more\" was not available yet, I started this show. I also wasn't crazy about the description, but I find that it hits similar beats to TGBM. It is also a heartfelt show about old age, regret and 2nd chances. Really enjoying it so far.",

            "comment": "I decided to cleanse my palate by re-watching one of my favorite sagueks with my all-time least favorite FL. Some thoughts on why I cannot finish my re-watch of **Scholar Who Walks the Night** (2015), even thought it stars Lee Joongi and features my all-time favorite vampire of all time, Gwi (Lee Soo-hyuk).\n\nI thought to myself that I may have judged Scholar too harshly because of when I watched it, which was right after seeing what I consider an amazing performance by Lee Joongi in **Flower of Evil**. Because in Scholar he is extremely OTT, channeling his best Bela Lugosi/Christopher Lee Dracula impression, rolling eyes and gritted teeth as he fights his desperate hunger for... man, you'd think blood, but it's usually hard to tell. Hungry for something. A Snickers, maybe (or Subway!).\n\nAnyway, I decide to give it another chance. The first episode is the glorious campy fire I remember, reminding me of watching old Hammer horror flicks on the local UHF station's \"Creature Double Feature\" every Saturday (the other regular Saturday treat was \"Kung Fu Theater\" so my whole personality makes sense). Gwi is amazing as always.\n\nThe FL, Jo Yang-sun (Lee Yu-bi), comes in toward the end of the first episode. I got a twinge when I first saw her, but I held in there. I made it to first kiss which is Episode 5. And I just can't.\n\nIt's not just because the FL is super annoying and has every childlike trait in the ineffectual FL book, but I realized my reaction is more visceral and personal with that. I'll try to summarize using the most cautious language I can; apologies if some of my terms are outdated.\n\nMy younger sister is on the autism spectrum (althought she's an older millennial so they called it ADHD back in her day), and in practice, it's kind of like having a permanent 16 year-old for a sister. It's wonderful in some ways (we can talk about Resident Evil and Pokemon and romance novels about demon possession) and terrifying in other ways, because while she has the libido and curiosity of a teenager, she has zero sense of self-preservation. Suffice to say, a great deal of time and effort goes into making sure she doesn't have boyfriends in prison or fall for scams or let anyone take advantage of her, because she believes with all her heart in whatever anyone tells her. She doesn't recognize the bad in anyone. Even Albert Wesker. That's how naive she is.\n\nSo I realized that is why I cannot re-watch Scholar; Yang-sun reminds me too much of my sister, and that makes me doubt her ability to give informed consent, which makes the entire romance part of the storyline creep me the eff out. I don't want to say it's because Yu-bi's acting is *bad*, but... it's just such a bundle of characteristics I've come to associate with vulnerability, I can't enjoy it.\n\nI realize that's random, but suffice to say, if you don't have a viscerally negative reaction to the FL, **Scholar Who Walks the Night** is a ton of fun and has cameos from some really fun actors. Plus my man, Gwi. He should've been the hero.",

            "comment": "I started watching *My Unfamiliar Family*, which has been on my 'try next' list for a while. I didn't like the first episode much when I tried it out - it felt sad and depressing; too serious - so I stopped partway through. I gave it another go when I felt more like it, and ended up appreciating it more. Perhaps the humour just came in the second half \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Two episodes through, and we'll see how it goes.\n\nI've also been watching *The Package.* I like it for being in France, and the French aspects, since French is my second language and I have a soft spot for that. It's different to what I'd expect of a K-drama in its tone and other things, but it has the typical Korean insights into relationships and human nature - how people feel about things, how life develops, decisions we make, etc. \n\n*Road Home* is a Chinese series I got into, and is not bad. It descends a bit into romance-novel territory that's typical of a Chinese drama, as far as my experience goes, but is otherwise thoughtful, hopeful, mature, heartfelt, and genuine. I quite like it. \n\nI finished, finally, my re-watch of *Cang Lan Jue* ('Love Between Fairy &amp; Devil') last night. \ud83d\ude22\ud83e\udd17 It's truly a perfect show - not faultless, but perfect: whole, complete, beautiful. I will be remembering it for a long time.\n\n*Our Blooming Youth* (17/20) is revealing answers and knotty problems all over. Heart-pounding danger &amp; plots, humour, poignant underlying things... and only a few more hours of watching wonderful Yi Hwan/Park Young Shik \ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udc51!\n\n*The Starry Love* (35/40) - Episode 35 \ud83d\ude27\ud83d\ude2d!\n\n*Guesthouse* (7/?) - They're still giving us different threads to confuse us about who's who. I still think lovely &gt;!Yoo Ha!&lt; is the lost prince, and one of the other two is the son of the Grand Prince; I'm not sure who the third is. I think there could be a twist regarding the/a Watchman (maybe none of these three are him). \n\nI started *My Perfect Stranger* (released this week); not sure about it yet, but it's certainly intriguing. I like when they give us clues, which the characters think as well, and then quickly reveal that we were wrong, but being wrong is sort of worse, because of what the real answer is. This is another example of the title chosen to go with not being the best of the options - some of the other English title options seemed more accurate.",

I could tell that this was deliberate, and meant to be the sort of story you could gently watch and reflect on, thinking about your own experiences or the implications of these situations in the characters' lives. I think it does go over some things too many times, and later on, the slowness is less necessary and pleasant, but I think I like gently taking in a story like this. It's a good foil for other, more intense series I'm watching.\n\nI think the actors as their characters do have an obvious connection at that point that you're talking about. They have a difficult backstory, which comes after a lovely backstory. This part is where they are deciding what to do now, realising that they are both still part of each others' lives and psyches. You'll see their connection much more easily as the story continues - but it does take a believable amount of time, especially because they're both reticent at this point. Interestingly, the guy - as the more reticent person usually - takes the initiative... which he actually did originally as well \ud83d\ude0a. \n\nIf you like the actor, I'd say keep watching. If you don't like the pace, though, that is a feature of the series, so I'd say in that case, maybe not.",

I was impressed with both of them but   Kim Tae Ri was by far my favorite part of 2521. I couldn't take my eyes off of her. I felt that Our Blues was such a quality star-studded production that Lee Byung Hun, although excellent and memorable, was surrounded by so many other iconic performers. It was the perfect ensemble cast. I'm glad to see him again.",

Also, will the main couple fall in love because he just feels so bad for her? \n\nMy Holo Love (6/12): Just when I thought the technology on Unlock My Boss couldn't get any more ludricious, My Holo Love one-upped it by a mile. Yet, I'm still enjoying it and I'm going along for the ride. It's definitely unpredictable! \n\nOnce Upon a Small Town (10/12): Honestly, I'm surprised by how much I've enjoyed this. It's a simple love story but very charming. The FL, Ja-Yeong, is just such a nice character: kind, helpful, but not always bright and sunny. You can't help but root for her and hope that she gets what she wants in life. I need more relaxing, low stakes romances like this one. \n\nReading:\nI've been listening to the audio book of Lovelight Farms by B.K. Borison and it's quite enjoyable.",

            "comment": "**Drops of God** (3/8): The love child of moody French film and Japanese melodrama. So far it's an enjoyable mix of intense training/competition, family secrets (that thankfully haven't veered into makjang territory) and a classic hero's journey of claiming an inheritance by first claiming the true self.\n\n**Good Bad Mother** (2/14): Very bombastic start. EP01 did a good job at setting up FLs POV and her hardships, but ML and SFL only had a few scenes before the story advanced to the present. In EP02 there's a *lot* going on with both of them in a rapid back-and-forth montage that presumably will get more development, but they're just character sketches with big question marks at the moment. Since it's the characters/storytelling that sell a drama for me - not the spectacle - not quite feeling this one yet. \n\n**Joseon Attorney** (10/16): Love it for its operatic highs and lows mixed with sort-of accurate historical legal shenanigans, but wish it were more subtle in its approach to characterization and romance. Everyone is an archetype, their actions and motivations ping pong without much development to suit the story, and the villains are the type that stand around twirling their mustaches because they're just that evil (though the big bad at least has a respectable pottery-making side-hobby).  \n\n**My Perfect Stranger** (2/16): Uneven start; EP01 was a fast and choppy rush to introduce the characters/premise while EP02 was a slow, slice-of-life nostalgia overload. There's already some iffy bits to the the time travel plot, but since this is clearly the sort of drama where things are going to be revealed gradually through exposition/backstory withholding judgement until a little further in. Really looking forward to a new complex, plot-driven romcom and hope this one can deliver.",

Deborah** because I had serious problems with the ML being normal after his breakup while the FL is a disaster who is ruining her life over a guy. It feels too imbalanced. Also, even by Kdrama standards the FL's drinking is a lot &gt;!(she is literally diagnosed with alcoholic gastritis yet apparently gets drunk the next episode and pees on the side of the road, yikes)!&lt;\n\nSince none of the currently airing Kdramas are interesting me, I'm watching **Flower Crew: Joseon Marriage Agency** and it's a lot of fun! Kim Min Jae is handsome and intense. There's a lot of comedy and the political bits are simplistic and require very little attention. The FL is annoying but not so much that it kills my enjoyment. You get to see Park Jihoon in a role that's the opposite of his role in Weak Hero Class 1.\n\nI'm also watching an incredibly intense Chinese drama called **The Bad Kids.** Three children accidentally video a murder then become embroiled with the murderer. What's amazing about the drama is that the kids are very much kids who need love, support, stability and adults they can trust. Sadly, they don't get any of it and as a result they make some truly awful decisions. Highly recommended, this one is available for free on YouTube: [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlCrV9TCfzMapVSZHRlsfXGnzmVqLz8LW](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlCrV9TCfzMapVSZHRlsfXGnzmVqLz8LW)",

A 7+, not amazing but pretty watchable;\n\nIn progress\n\n\\- **Joseon Attorney (10/16):** this drama badly needed angst and it delivered, the last ep a big question mark for the leading couple moving forward.

Not always balanced but on an upward trajectory;\n\n\\- **Taxi Driver 2 (5/16):** the gang is back and it's all as good as we left it. Poignant cases, A+ acting like always and more Pyo Hye Jin screentime is only welcomed and to be praised she's that good, LJH dealing as usual.

In fact, all the time it's very difficult to know the real goals of the characters, who they really love, and what might happen to them in the end. The character arcs and morality are not clich\u00e9s, despite being a classic. On top of all that, it still has iconic actors like Song Joong-ki and Lee Kwang-soo. The secondary characters aren't very complex, but not much time is wasted on banal stories either. Most of the time the relationships that are most important to the central theme are explored. (my comments continue after this picture)\n\nPlus:  \n\u2705 The soundtrack is very striking for each character and in the most emotional scenes it sets the tone and accentuates our reactions.  \n\u2705 The opening of the series is particularly interesting, with the clock ticking back.  \n\u2705 Also, it is available on netflix and other major streaming platforms in other countries.  \nI watched it after watching Vincenzo and fell in love with Song Joong Ki and recommend it to people who liked classic dramas like Heirs. Although the plot is not conventional. Very interesting!!  \nMy review with SPOILERS from The Innocent Man about what I thought about the ending. Read it only if you've watched the series--&gt;&gt;! I loved the series so much. I feel like the real ending was him dying alone in the street and the rest they did just to comfort our hearts. And the saddest thing is that by his true behavioral profile the woman he truly loved was Han Jae-Hee and not Eun-gi. The scene where I cried the most is when he said that he was responsible for Han Jae-Hee becoming what she became. It was very deep and sad.!&lt;",

In love. It almost feels liek you're watching a kdrama with anime vibes. I'm also really enjoying the main leads relationship development and this drama has already given me goosebumps. The ending of episode 2 has become one of my fav kdrama endings tbh. I was overwhelmed with emotions!!!\n\n**Mr Queen** (16/20) struggling to finish. I started The Glory after getting really far in Mr Queen and it distracted me away from it. And now that I started 2521 I can't really go back to Mr Queen till I'm atleast done with The Glory.... but I am not really the biggest fan of historical dramas and Mr Queen has surpassed my expectations and might be my fav historical drama.",

Your emotions will be toyed with as the show turns it up considerably after the early episodes. It\u2019s been an entire year and no other show has had such an impact.",

The plot is also nice and incredible so in my opinion this was a MUST WATCH! \n\nCrash landing on you - I'M SPEECHLESS THIS K DRAMA LEFT ME SPEECHLESS. \n\nThen there's business proposal - This one's been really nice I just completed it and it was incredible \n\nthen Home town cha cha cha - I've only watched 4 episodes but it's good up till now. \n\nSo not worth it - I won't say it's incredible but it's a nice time pass although some scenes look alot overdone so it can be over acting instead of comedy sometimes but yeah it's also nice in some ways \nSo Can you suggest what should I watch next? \n\nI also tried golden spoon But dropped it on Ep8 It really didn't seem nice to me it was very irritating to watch it over all. So I couldn't help but drop the drama.",

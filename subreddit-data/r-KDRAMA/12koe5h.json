    "postText": "**Check the Post for Stickied Mod-notes Before Participating**\n\nFrom time to time issues arise within the on-air discussions, whether it be a broadcasting delay, if the discussion requires a flair passport or something related to user conduct has come up. Please check and read the note in full before participating in the discussion. Failure to read and follow instructions in Mod Notes is not a defense against moderation actions that may be taken on your account.\n\n**Contribute Meaningful Content**\n\nThe spirit of discussion in this subreddit is to delve into the details and intricacies in what we watch, what our opinions are, and how we feel about what we watched. We encourage our users to participate in our on-air discussions with this mindset to get the most out of our community and the discussions.\n\nMeaningful comments do not have to be thesis length but they should contain your personal insight and observations about the drama or share items of interest for fellow viewers such a relevant news articles, behind the scenes content, or insightful content about the drama hosted on other platforms.\n\n**Check Your Spelling, Grammar and Formatting**\n\nBefore hitting send on your comment, take a minute to check that your spelling and grammar is correct. Using correct spelling and punctuation aids in reducing miscommunication and misunderstanding between the writer and the reader.\n\nTry to avoid unclear abbreviations and internet slang -- keep in mind that our community is international and things like abbreviations and internet slang are often the easiest things to get lost in translation.\n\nBlocks of text are hard to read. If you are submitting larger blocks of text please format your text into paragraphs so readers are able to read them with ease. Formatting your text in easily readable chunks will make it easier for the reader to process and comprehend.\n\n**Be Clear About Which Episode is Being Discussed**\n\nIf participating in a multiple episode thread clearly mark what episode your thoughts are pertaining to.\n\nGenerally we advise that you make separate comments for each episode, especially if you are watching and participating as the drama airs. If you are joining in the conversation at a later date after all episodes for that week have aired, then combining multiple episode comments into a single comment also works.\n\n**Use Character Names or Role Descriptions**\n\nWhen discussing a character or their actions within the drama, try to use character names or role descriptions rather than the name of the actor or actress.\n\n***Examples***\n\n* *Kim Tan force kissed Eunsang.* -- **Recommended** -- Using character names makes it clear that you are discussing the character in the drama and there is no blurring or confusion between drama-world and real life.\n\n* *ML force kissed FL.* -- **Recommended** -- Using role descriptions such as ML (male lead) and FL (Female Lead) also makes it clear that you are discussing the character in the drama. Some users may prefer role descriptions because it can be clearer and easier to write rather than character names (especially for supporting/tertiary characters -- ie 'the Truck of DoomTM driver'). We advise that you keep the use consistent within a single comment (ie. don't user Kim Tan and ML simultaneously in a comment, stick to one). If you are replying to another user's comment, try to follow their usage.\n\n* *Lee Min Ho force kissed Park Shin Hye.* -- **Not Recommended** -- Using the names of the actor and actress in place of the character name or role discussion when discussing character actions within the drama blurs the line between drama-world and real life and can lead to things such as an inability to separate the character from the actor. Using the names of the actor and actress is not advised unless you are specifically discussing their acting technique.\n\n**Use Spoiler Tags**\n\nSpoiler tags are simple and easy to use so there is no excuse not to use them. See our [spoiler tag guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags/) on how and when to use them. If your spoilers are pertaining to something other than the on-air drama e.g. the source material -- please clearly mark in brackets before the spoiler what exactly is being spoiled.\n\nFor example if the drama is an adaptation of a webtoon and you are discussing the webtoon your spoiler might appear like this:\n\n&gt; (spoiler for webtoon) &gt;!spoiler filled text!&lt;\n\nWhile the usage of spoiler tags is encouraged in our on-airs, especially for major twists -- as spaces for discussions of kdramas, users will be discussing what has happened in the latest episode(s). If you want to avoid spoilers completely, it is advised that you do not enter into these threads at all until you have completed viewing the episodes for yourself.\n\n**Note Any Edits**\n\nIf you have to edit your comment for any reason, please leave a note down the bottom explaining why the comment was edited. This helps preserve context and transparency in discussions.\n\n**DO NOT Petition For Split Threads**\n\nAs part of our normal moderation duties the moderation team monitor the on-airs for user conduct and participation levels. This includes both the quantity and quality of discussions being had. It is unnecessary to petition, complain, beg, or ask for threads to be split.\n\nAlso do not make calls for people to comment to 'break' records or to satisfy comment quotas -- focus on contributing to the discourse meaningfully and letting the quality of the discussion reflect the quality of the drama instead of turning the amount of comments into a popularity contest.\n\n**DO NOT Post Low Effort One-Liners**\n\nLow effort comments are those which add very little value to the discussion.\n\nRather than posting a one liner such as, \u201cI love/hate this drama\u201d go into details of the whos/hows/whys you may just find someone who feels the same way.\n\nWhen responding to other user\u2019s comments, make an effort. Short comments such as \u201clol\u201d, \u201cthis\u201d, and similar expressions of agreement are unnecessary and do not add to the conversation. Instead use the upvote function to express that you have seen the comment and feel that it should be seen.\n\nOther one-liner comments that should be avoided include catchphrases from the drama.\n\n**DO NOT Split Commentary Into Separate Comments**\n\nA single comment per user per episode is adequate (unless your commentary exceeds the 10,000 character limitations of a comment), you can always come back and edit your comment if you want to add to your thoughts.\n\nSplitting commentary into one-liner comments may be viewed as spamming behavior and result in bans from the community. Please do not treat on-air threads like it is Twitter and split commentary into a bunch of live reaction \"tweets\" -- combine your reactions into a single comment.\n\n**DO NOT Spoil People On Purpose**\n\nDo not return to an earlier discussion to leave commentary about later episodes. People who haven't watched at the same pace, or even years later visit these threads to read the comments as they watch the drama. Leaving spoilers whether on purpose or without thought is not acceptable behaviour.\n\nSimilarly in a standard double episode thread do not reply to a user's first episode of the week comment (or tag them) with spoilers from the second episode such as \"you were right\" as they may not have had the chance to watch the episode yet.\n\n**DO NOT Forget That People Have Different Watch Experiences**\n\nOur subreddit is made up of users from all walks of life from all around the world with different thoughts, opinions and experiences. They are all welcome to have their own opinions and reasons for watching the drama (including hate-watching).\n\nThey are allowed to have a different opinion to you. DO NOT try to force your opinion on another user.\n\nThey are allowed to have a different watch experience. DO NOT attack or criticize another user if they have a different watch experience.\n\nThey are allowed to comment in on-airs even if they are criticizing a drama or expressing a negative watch experience.\n\n**DO NOT Make Things Personal**\n\nDo not engage in personal attacks, including attributing certain qualities or labels to a user based on their commentary.\n\n*Examples*\n\n* *\"You are racist.\"* - This is a direct personal attack. It does not matter if the OP presented themselves in this light, direct attacks are not allowed.\n\n* *\"Your comment was racist\"* - While this is not a direct personal attack as it passes judgment on the comment rather than the OP, such a comment may, depending on context, still be viewed as a personal attack/negative behavior as it ties the comment to the OP and can sometimes be taken as \"your comment is X, therefore, you are also X.\" If this is the primary or only point in your comment, it may be removed as a personal attack/negative behavior. If this is a secondary point, we will evaluate the total context of your comment before considering removal.\n\n* *\"OP, your comment came across as racist, and here's why...\"* - This is a much better approach. It extends the benefit of the doubt to the OP by separating them from their comment and puts the focus on how their comment comes across to others rather than simply passing judgement on it. By providing context to the OP and offering them the other side's perspective on how the comment was received, you are giving the OP a chance to see their commentary in a different light and may help them broaden their views and perspectives.\n\n**DO NOT Focus On Reddit Karma Or Popularity Of Opinions**\n\nKeep discussions focused on the kdrama itself. Discussion of Reddit upvotes/downvotes is completely irrelevant to the kdrama -- just focus on discussing the drama. In a similar vein, discussion of the perceived relative popularity of an opinion is completely irrelevant to the kdrama -- just focus on discussing the drama. STOP talking about whether your opinion is unpopular or not and just make your point about the drama.\n\n**DO NOT Report Comments Just Because You Disagree**\n\nThe reporting function is for reporting comments that break our subreddit's rules and policies -- it is not a super downvote.\n\nPlease report comments only when they break rules or policies.\n\n**DO NOT Harass On-Air Hosts**\n\nYour on-air hosts are volunteers doing a great service to the community -- do not harass them about items related to moderation -- such as splitting threads, posting times, or comment removals/locking. The majority of the on-air hosts are not mods and do not have any control over moderation.\n\n**DO NOT Ask For Streaming Sources/Complain About Streaming Availability**\n\nAll On-Air discussions have available legal streaming sources listed in the post body -- please READ THE POST BODY for the streaming source instead of posting a comment asking for a streaming source. If you do not see the drama on the listed streaming source in your region, reach out to customer service of your streaming service for availability issues.\n\nPlease do not complain about limited availability or regional restrictions, it sucks -- everyone gets it. Complaining about it in on-airs achieves nothing to change the situation and it detracts from discourse about the kdrama itself. Please focus the discourse in on-airs on the kdrama at hand instead of the millionth complaint about regional restrictions of streaming services.\n\n---\n\n*Note:* This post is part of our recurring post series 'The r\\/KDRAMA Approach' which highlights different aspects of our subreddit moderation approach and policies.

It\u2019s soapy, to be sure, and there\u2019s plenty of (pleasurable) histrionics, but it follows its storyline straight to the end. The BOF plot takes detours to make the show last longer, so the pacing, character development, etc. are at a slower pace.",

It is like watching a reality show only to see how badly the participants can screw up.\n\nHowever, I really like Kim Tan's mom. She is so quirky and I enjoy her relationship both with Kim Tan and Eun-Sang's mother. I find that she is such a ray of sunshine in this show.",

            "comment": "I had put off watching the last few episode of the Red Sleeve and finished them last night and, ,man, was I a bawling mess. \n\nThe last episode had scenes that were hitting me one after another - the scene with the &gt;!death , the scene about Court Lady Seo telling the guard that the king finally chose a concubine, seeing the last friend alone with all of the others dead. !&lt;I haven't cried so much since Hachi a dogs tale. My 10 year old son was very confused about why I was crying so much for a tv show and I kept repeating 'its so sad'. And God did I feel for both of them. \n\nHer lines - &gt;!In our next life, if u see me pretend you don't know me and walk past me. I just want to live like I want to in my next life !&lt;\\- were the highlight of this episode. Although at that moment it seemed like her last words to him were mean in a way, I understood it. The meaning behind the dialogue being so multifaceted and something that would resonate with so many people even in present times and times to come. For people making choices, that question of \"what if\" would always be there.\r  \n\r  \nThe fact that she was robbed off&gt;! even the most simple pleasures in her life like just hanging out with her friends made me really pity her. Her life was reduced to waiting for the king and yet she chose it bcos she loved him!&lt;.\r  \n\r  \nIt would have been so fitting if they had an epilogue for their next life where her wishes come true.\r  \n\r  \nI was a fan of Lee Jun Ho since \"Just between lovers\". He is an amazing actor and i'm glad he's doing more meaningful dramas where he can show his acting range. Lee Se Young was amazing too, I don't think anyone could have done justice to this role other than her.\r  \n\r  \nAll in all, the show has left a sort of a hole in my heart, a show that I will remember for a long time.",

You can honestly spend so much time analysing all the characters, their stories and their motivations. The acting from everyone was also stellar, no one underperformed.\n\nFor me, the most memorable moments are when &gt;! their baby dies!&lt; and Jun Ho &gt;! Lifts his hand and it just drops with a thud. !&lt;  He does the the same thing when &gt;! Duk Im dies !&lt; and for me that decision to add that little movement into the script was just so perfect because it really makes us feel how anguished he is at the finality of it all. \n\nI want to rematch it but I'm not sure if I manage the emotional rollercoaster again. But honeslty the best kdrama I've watched.",

TKEM is one of those high concept shows that tries to wow; 20th Century tells a simple story in a simple way.    \n\nTKEM - an interesting addition to the list of time travel/multiverse shows. Watch it for the high production values and Woo Do Hwan. Don\u2019t watch it if you\u2019re looking for a believable romance. This was extremely bingeable because of the interesting plot but I was annoyed by the lack of chemistry between ML and FL. And wow, all that PPL!\n\n20th Century Boy Girl - a solid show that features strong female friendships. Watch it for a good friends-to-lovers story. Don\u2019t watch if you\u2019re looking for something groundbreaking. I watched this over the course of 4 weeks which is slow for me but I finished it feeling satisfied.\n\nI am holding off from starting anything new for a few days because life. But I\u2019ve got my eye on either **Tail of the Nine Tailed**, **Joseon Attorney** or **Still 17**. Reviews of these three welcome!",

I restarted it from the beginning but skipped some parts that I remembered. I think I like it better this time, and it serves it's purpose of distracting me temporarily from my problems. I love Lee Kwang Soo but his character here is pretty annoying.",

My question about the ending is why in the world &gt;!did they make it so that he was in a coma for 2 years and somehow lived??? This makes literally no sense. In the past, they did not have feeding tubes or other medical advancements that made it possible for a person to live for a long time in a coma. Just a head scratcher. And it was just so sad they decided to make the queen infertile. Just why?!&lt; I remember the ending for all the wrong reasons.",

It still baffles me how they disgusting the people in the drama regard FL as she is overweight (which is probably why I put it off for so long). Nevertheless, I am trying to ignore that and enjoy the drama in its 2015 glory. It\u2019s quite fun. I am skipping the side couple though, they are irredeemable.\n\nEdit: wonder if anyone could tell me if \u201cJoseon Attorney\u201d is a good watch?",

There's a generic 'genius lawyer vs corrupt officials for revenge' set-up, but if you're at all curious about law in the Joseon era it does a good job at balancing fact and fiction and the court cases are interesting.\n\nAs a romance and/or character journey, not so great. All the main characters are basic archetypes and they're never given a chance by the story to show who they are personally or how they relate to each other outside of the conflict they're dealing with. Very formulaic.",

Usually what keeps me going is having a character that I like or root for and for this one, I don't really like any of the characters except maybe Kim Young Dave's character if I had to choose, though sometimes his role feels sparse. There's a lot of mysteries in this drama but it feels a bit scattered and too slow burn. Characters are interesting but I just wish the story felt more cohesive.",

I think subconsciously I worry I'm not gonna like the 1st episode.\n\nWell this show pulled me in. I already love all the characters and it feels so expensive to look at. I feel like I'm going to really need to pay attention to these storylines though.\n\nAlso the music direction is so so good. Some kdramas have a habit of playing a song/melody at the worst moment or drawing it out like they're demanding you to feel something. This music felt sophisticated.",

I gave up theorising after the first few eps because the misleading cuts and editing style were making everything too unreliable. Despite the very many WTF turns in the storytelling, I still found the show enjoyable. But the fatigue many were talking about is finally catching up - I just finished ep 13 which was really poorly done imo. So many plot conveniences that it's used up any leniency I'd given the show. I will still finish the drama primarily because the performances are top notch - this is my first Lee Sueng Gi show and he's been terrific in showing &gt;!the subtle changes when he switches modes!&lt;",

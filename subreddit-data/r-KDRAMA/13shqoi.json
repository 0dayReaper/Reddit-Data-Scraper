I don't know what his motive is, is he really trying to fight for the doctors or he is here to play mental chess. But whatever it is, it's absolutely childish. I'm super glad that Eun-Jae gave &gt;!her father a piece but regardless it didn't seem to have any affect on that thick skin. Kim sabu is right Senior Cha failed in every role he donned.!&lt;\n\nAlso I loved how Kim Sabu &gt;!humiliated Dr. Cha Jinman in the end. He thought he knew everything and that he was the better player - Oh that humbling in that moment!&lt; \\-  Chef Kiss!   \n\nDr. Jang is absolutely soft. He clearly has bonded with his teacher Woo-Jin and is always worried about him.&gt;! His entry with falling on the bum in the collapsed building and that tiny \"Hajima\" was so him and touched my heart. Yup Kim Sabu is right again - Dr. Jang's heart is opening up to Doldam Hospital. I'm very intrigued about the player though. What secrets are hidden behind that  cassette player. !&lt;\n\nalso ***Special mention to Ahn Hyo-Seop's acting. He made me cry today. the emotions he showed and the crying. Uff - Phenomenal actor!***\n\nDirector Park gets extra brownie points - he is really shinning for me in this season. \n\nAlso the way Kim Sabu and Woo-Jin's scene screamed of father-son love without any explicit element. Ahh loved it. There was trust and there were actions to keep that trust. Loved it! \n\nThe **PLAN A! left my jaw dropping. That one phone call got me super excited! Cannot wait for it!** \n\nAh Reum nailed it! she was direct - made &gt;!Eun-Tak know his mistake, made him acknowledge it and left with warning and direct consequences!!&lt; LOVED IT!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbsolutely excited for next week although it's already towards its end \ud83d\ude2d",

He didn't text in episode 1 when she was away on her mission trip and he didn't text her this time after he returned from the disaster site. He is afterall trained by Dr Kim, so I can see why he would place his patients first, but that's not helping his relationship. Imo she has every right to be angry.\n\nI want to see more of both of them developing their relationship further. We see a lot of reset couple and their lovey dovey moments. I hope  the writers will give us more of the dimpled couple in the remaining episodes. We haven't even seen them hug or hold hands.",

However, I wish he had just stopped and told her the situation instead of just running off like that.

I rewatched S2 and Director Park was a much better antagonist. It was easier to understand Dr. Park because his trauma/inferiority stemmed from not being able to help the passengers on the bus. He was insecure but still a decent doctor. \n\nJin-man is the head of the TRAUMA center and he is nonchalantly walking around the hospital while everyone is scrambling to help the gunshot victims, because he was petty over Nurse Oh telling him he should learn if he doesn\u2019t know. In this episode, he literally ignores all calls even after seeing the Code Orange. How are you running a trauma center with no sense of urgency or will? \n\nWe\u2019re told he\u2019s \u201cthe only one who\u2019s a match for Master Kim\u201d but Master Kim is running laps around this dude in both skill and \nleadership. He gives Eun Jae incorrect, unsolicited advice which almost cost the patient\u2019s life. Then coldly tells her his advice wasn\u2019t wrong and that it was a special case. He lacks a lot of empathy which at least Dr. Park had in S2. \n\nUnless something significantly changes or unravels, I\u2019m not convinced how he can take over for Master Kim.",

She is able to compartmentalise her emotions and block out her worries for SWJ and focus on her patient.\n\nHowever I dun think Areum is mopey in her attitude towards PET. Anyone, when their partner is involved in a major incident, will be dead worried. And it is not wrong to expect a reassuring call or text if the partner is safe. From the scene, we see PET casually walking, with no sense of urgency. Not to say that he don\u2019t care about Areum, but rather that Areum might not be THAT important to him at that time. He was more concerned about Master Kim and SWJ. Not that there is anything wrong with that either. Just that it  does show what Areum said, that she likes him more that he likes her. Or she prioritises her him higher than him her. \n\nPerhaps this is where Dr Jang will then try to get close to her and this might fire up PET.",

AhReum understood that Nurse Park could be doing his job and busy treating patients. AhReum understood that their are things of priority... \nbut she understand as well that she needs to be felt as partner and not just a colleague you work with.\n\n\nIt may be petty or a tantrum for some, but I understood her reaction, and Nurse Park, for a change, needs to understand AhReum...",

In a serious relationship (and I'll assume that this is the stage theyre in given that theyve been together for three freaking years!), it's kind of a given that your loved ones will come to mind when you're in a traumatic / catastrophic accident. From my understanding,  the fact that Ahreum wasn't even in Eun Tak's afterthought during that moment is what upsets her. Yes, the patients come first. Yes, he wanted to save lives. But couldn't he have went directly to her as soon as he was finished? How he so nonchalantly walked down the hallway and greeted AhReum after she's probably been worried the entire day is probably what set her off. I think things could have taken a different turn if he hugged her as soon as he saw and said \"I'm sorry for worrying you. I'm sorry for making you wait, but blah blah blah\". But noooooo he just played dumb when she got mad.",

Yes she is portrayed as tough and professional all that in this season but it only comes when it happens to someone related to her, in this case, Woo Jin, not just to herself so that she gets a standalone moment to shine. She\u2019s not the story, she\u2019s just an act of a story, while Woo Jin is given a whole story. I don\u2019t hate the writer as someone who is talented of scriptwriting, but that writer is hella sexist and I can\u2019t think otherwise.

I absolutely cannot review this episode side by side. This is too much.\n* The fact that Dr. Cha cares more about the &gt;!court case!&lt; than a Code Orange speaks a lot. He's clearly more interested in keeping his position and handling the politics but doesn't give a shit about his role as a doctor\r\n* That worrying af glance Eun-jae gives to Woo-Jin before departing to the hospital has my heart. The heartbreaking way in which Eun-jae has to inform the &gt;!dead student's friend that she can't perform CPR!&lt; was done beautifully. Even the way she collected herself after [finding out Woo-Jin](https://imgur.com/v6Xg4IZ) went into the &gt;!collapsed building!&lt; was amazing. Low key I'm glad Nurse Joo didn't tell her about the latest development at the scene.... I don't think she would've been able to focus on the surgery. \r\n* Not savior mode Dr. Seo Woo-Jin!!!! It's a fact he prioritizes his patients over his own safety. But let's admit the decision to go in was a bit foolish. I would like to think it was an impulsive decision since &gt;!he just lost a student moments ago!&lt;. [Euntak](https://imgur.com/7R6tZEl) saying &gt;!\"There's no pulse.\"!&lt; is one of the worst things to happen at the scene. There were probably more patients who needed doctors elsewhere. But oh well.... Given &gt;!he has severely injured his arm I wonder if he'll be set on a similar path to recovery like Kim Sabu!&lt;. Writer-nim, you really need to give the poor guy a break. \r\n* [Kim Sabu's furiousness](https://imgur.com/D3eR3d5) at finding out Woo-jin and Eun-tak went &gt;!inside the collapsed building!&lt; was truly something else. I had legit goosebumps. He was rightly furious with Euntak and Woo-jin's suicide mission. I wonder if he'll blame himself for making Woo-jin adopt this '[saviour](https://imgur.com/LuyGXCr)' mindset or if &gt;!Woo-jin actually loses the capability to operate as he used to.!&lt; \n* Let's be real Assemblyman Ko's secretaries trying to pull strings &gt;!with the governor to rescue her first!&lt; is what's really expected of them. With the &gt;!second collapse!&lt;, I really think she's heavily injured but there's a possibility she has some &gt;!prior disease!&lt;. At least, that's what the promo indicated. Hopefully, now she can realize how stupid it was of her to criticize the Trauma Centre.\n* Also, major MAJOR props to the way this episode was shot. Seeing the [collapsed building](https://imgur.com/d8iqzoG) and the chaotic situation the first time around gave me literal chills. I would've fainted at the scene. &gt;!The second collapse was bound to happen,!&lt; of course, it's a Kdrama. This is the second time around I'm seeing doctors at such a scene. DoTS one definitely pales compared to this. I'm really glad they're putting the budget for this season in the right place.\n* If &gt;!Euntak and Dr. Areum don't hug in front of the entire hospital when he returns!&lt; I'LL BE REALLY REALLY FURIOUS",

This would be perfect timing with Seojin not being able to surgery and they need a GS! \n\nBut tbh I kind of want Jang Dohwa to step up and take the lead, but even more than him Dr Yang to prove himself at least he admitted before that he is not experienced with traumas, and I know his character is mostly for comic relief as he has only had diarhea or written reports and apologized to Park Minguk but if Park Minguk could have a redemption arc let his lackey also get one.  Give some humanity to his character. \n\nLet someone other than Seowojin shine while he is in timeout. \n\nAlthough it would be funny to see how Seo woojin will react to Kan Dong Joo we already saw how jealous he got of DoInbum last season. \n\nHim being fed and cared for in episode 10 was endearing it was like he got a taste o having a mother it is really endearing that they brought and put the mother of the paramedic who died last season back as a second mom to Seo Woojin, and we already know that Kim Sabu is basically his fatherly figure.\n\nEunjae finally asking her dad the hard questions after surgery , it was interesting that they showed dr Lee staying and listening in I wonder why they did that, it is oblivious he really loos up to her , such a puppy newbie doctor.\n\nKim Sabus and doctor Jang Dohwas conversation made me question if maybe it was Kim Sabu that made him come to doldam, it alluded to him at least knowing why he was there. I don't think it was just to show Sabu charming him, although that part was sweet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was really cute how dr Jung was looking at the stars before calling Byul.\n\nI feel for Yoon aerum at this point it feels like Euntak is caring so much for woojin that he is ready to steal him from eunjae, joke aside the bromance is sweet. But he clearly only worries about others and isn't realising that there are people worrying about him too, which makes sense because euntak kind of like woojin has been a lonewolf for quite sometime we never hear about his family and we are back to why they are bffs again.",

She is calm and professional in her work even though she could easily break down when knowing &gt;!Woo Jin entered the collapsed building!&lt;. She composed herself really well even though her voice was trembling and tears were hurdling up in her eyes. She put her own feelings aside to treat the patients first. Everyone was avoiding to mention Woo Jin to her because they felt bad for her situation and they gave her a space, but she still put her work as priority. &gt;!Taking a few minutes to check on Woo Jin and learn about his hand condition, Eun Jae still tried to save the patient that Woo Jin risked his life to protect!&lt; up untill she saw him after the surgery. She finally broke into tears but then hold it up again when &gt;!Woo Jin woke up so that the first thing he saw is a fearless Eun Jae, not a broken Eun Jae!&lt;. Eun Jae endured all those pains without a single complaint, without crying out loud, without a sympathy hug or encouragement. She carried all those feelings all alone and still be able to complete her work as a doctor and make sure the people she cares won\u2019t worried about her. Impressive character given the fact that she appeared in the show with a weak plot and less screen time. I feel her pain so much and I hope she could finally let it out someday, or having somebody to listen to her feelings.",

This is only the first part of the rescue but I felt the emergency was really rushed with lots of voice over and music instead of foccus on cases , but then again at this scale of an emergency it makes sense!&lt;\n\nMy beef with this episode is &gt;!how they portrayed and put eunjaes focus more as a girl friend rather than her as a doctor. Like at the scene when she gets the emergency alarm when she is with her mum at the bathroom it cuts to woojin getting ready to ditch eunjae as if eunjae was not a doctor or a person with medical license, like I get that a gs is more useful and important but is eunjae that useless that Kim Sabine and the rest of the group to not call her to duty? !&lt;\n\n&gt;!And then when news about woojin and euntak reach doldam they put the focus on him w shaken eunjae and Kim sabu are, I really liked nurse joos response to eunjae when she asked to be notified since she is worried ofc they are all worried. But here is the thing they did not show yoon aerum maybe she isn\u2019t even aware of the situation but it got me annoyed how they put eunjae as the worried wife waiting for the hero to come back . !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Although fair point maybe it fits with eunjaes character as she is prone to be nervous but like I a want to see more of her fierce heart of steel and side.!&lt;\n\nI get that &gt;!woojin is Kim sabus adopted son at this point too man loves him so much but darn he could have mentioned euntak too that is your second son don\u2019t play favorites Kim sabu!!&lt; \n\nAlso from the beginning I expected doctor Jung to join the on-site team because he was with the paramedics it made no sense for him to not get a ride with them \n\nI am curious about Jang Dohwas back story did he come to doldam because Seoul wouldn\u2019t accept him or did he like Lee get inspired by Doldam? I kind of wish he was a fanboy of seo woojin in med school and decided to follow him only to realize what a hellish teacher he is.",

This was motion picture scale stuff - the forces (and budget) involved and required to achieve this was considerable and says a lot about how successful is this series. It was a four-storey structure and we saw it intact and occupied with fitted-out shops at street level and with people inside; in other words, it had to be safe to occupy, not just be a facade. And the collapse had to be realistic, that is to say, the concrete rubble had to look real and take the weight of searchers standing on top. I thought it was really well done.\n\nThe shooting of these scenes outside felt realistic. Every shot of the medicos working had action going on around and in the background; this meant a team of Assistant Directors guiding the large number of extras to have convincing action taking place - all of them appropriately wardrobed and made up with dust and/or injury effects. No mean feat to achieve.\n\nFinal thought: I loved the beautiful emotional ballad, \"I Promise You\", sung by Lee Juck in Ep. 9 at the 0'51\" mark and again in Ep.10 at the 1'02\" mark.  It was used to very good effect, IMO, especially in Ep.10 when Soon Young's mother brings freshly cooked food to the hospital for Woo Jin after his surgery. Within a day he had seen the chaos of mayhem &amp; hurt at the site of the collapsed building, had to harness critical medical &amp; decision-making skills under pressure, followed his inner voice into the building itself and consequently suffer injuries and the possibility of his own death, endure pain unlike anything he's ever experienced in his life and the prospect of the end of his career as a surgeon, and while the rest of the hospital was still coping with patients everywhere, on his own was left in a post-op daze, thanks to the pain killer meds he had been given. AND THEN in comes Soon Young's mum, and with a simple act of kindness, offers Woo Jin the chance to cry in response to everything that has just happened to him, and to cry in gratitude for those who cared for him when he, the doctor, became he, the patient, and gave him all the care he had given others. I did not know of Ahn Hyo Seop before this series: he has a solid fan in me from now on. Terrific acting.",

I felt all the emotions and I love how Nurse Oh came to check up on her too \u2764\ufe0f \n\nBuuuuuuuuut the reunion was NOT what I was expecting it to be. In my head, a perfect scenario would have been Eun Tak running to AhReum as soon as he got back to the hospital. I expected AhReum to pound his chest and ask him \"why did you do that? You had me worried sick!\" And he would be like dont you worry my lady I am alive &amp; well and cue kiss scene!! But nooooope. We didn't get that. Maybe that's what Ahreum also expected but she was pushed to the way end of his priority list. Even when they did end up seeing each other in the hallway he didn't even look happy? relieved? to see AhReum waiting for him. I mean... if I went through a crazy traumatic incident like he &amp; SWJ did- the presence of a loved one would have brought me immense peace &amp; comfort. But I just didn't see that with Eun Tak- which is is why I feel like AhReums anger is completely comprehensible. I really hope he reflects and realize how much AhReum means to him and ACT IT!",

It used to be Mon-Tue slot but now It\u2019s weekend drama (Fri&amp;Sat) so the ratings are really competitive, especially to some family dramas. The target audience of weekend dramas is usually housewives so medical dramas are not their thing. Young people might be interested but since it\u2019s weekend, it\u2019s easier for them to watch the drama later (which will release the ep on Disney+ and Wavve just a couple hours after it\u2019s aired on TV) so they don\u2019t watch live TV any more. It also competes directly to Dr. Cha which is getting so many attention and good.",

Just because her situations aren't overly dramatic doesn't mean they aren't valid.\n\nSwj on the other hand just feels like the writer is putting him in dangerous situations for the sake of it or as a tool to make Kim Sabu see how his ways can be extreme at times \ud83e\udd37",

It'd be nice to see more of them but I'm not complaining they're not the mains after all.\n\nBtw, I really like how Areum handled their confrontation. Like she may come off as childish because she's petite, cute, and loves candies but the way she handled it was really mature. Her complaints are valid and opening up and saying &gt;! that she'll be mad for the time being was the right thing to do cuz it gives Euntak time to correct his ways. Glad she didn't shut him off.!&lt;",

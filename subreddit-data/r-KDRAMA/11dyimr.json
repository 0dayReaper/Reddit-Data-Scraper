I saw some of her interviews and her work and now i am a fan of both the husband and the wife. They have such a beautiful love story too (fell in love at first sight on a street in a foreign country). Sadly some of the videos on YouTube are not subbed so my curiosity is still at its peak. Yoo Teo is so talented and handsome and I want to see him in more projects. Hopefully he'll grace my screen more often in the coming days. Producers and writers please hire Yoo Teo (preferably for romantic comedies).",

And Nikki S Lee too! Her projects work is fascinating, and I find it to be so nice that they are together the way they are. I found that he singlehandedly made a docu in his lockdown in Antwerp, and it's called _Log in Belgium_. He looks back on life through this video essay that features his love for the film medium, and it sounds  .  .  .  like what I want to watch next.\n\nSo, thank you for writing this! It's good that I lucked into being aware of him like this.",

I'm only up to ep 6 or something, but I adore him. I find him thoroughly believeable as the wildcard accountant with a secret heart of gold. He pulls it off without being a polar character, without duality, for, aren't we all multidimensional characters? There are many oppositions but no contradictions, every aspect of him is Kim Sung ryong. \n\nI heard this man played a psycopath once? Can't wait to go through his filmography",

There's a meme with his into the ring hairstyle on this sub somewhere, a quality meme from a quality show. I really enjoyed it, it's quirky and solid. He plays a straight laced accountant in Into the Ring, and in Psycopath Diary he plays a crazy hot chaebol serial killer. I watched them at the same time and they make quite a pair.\n\nNow onto the still pending list.\nHere I go!!\n\n(It is actually a lot, plus i don't even remember the why's to most of them anymore, i must just trust in my past self)\n\nThere's Jang Hyuk, who I'll mostly be getting to next. He has an aura. And I heard someone say a thing about deep rooted tree and him being fantastic.\n\nJung Jinyoung. I saw the trailer to a film he was in, he seemed quite good. It's always nice when idols turn into actors who act well. I recently had a phase with a b1a4 song and that made me put him up here. Probably will watch Police University for the bonus Krystal (Jung Soojung)\n\nNow, the rest of this list is quite a mess, a veritable soup of actors of all kind:\n\nLee Seunggi, Yoo Yeonseok, Jeon Doyeon, Kim Heeae, Im Soojung, Jisung, Lee Joonhyuk, Yoon Shiyoon, Han Jimin, Oh Jungse, Kim Heesun, Hwang Jungeum, Yun Jeonghie, Yang Sejong, Choi Jiwoo, Lee Youngae.\n\nI'm having a throwback phase on the side so some of these may be actors from older dramas.\n\nAlso, should I watch undateables next? Is it a good drama? Are there duds in Namgoong Min filmography?",

He has been on my list for a long time but I always ended up watching romcoms \ud83d\ude05\n\nJung jingyoung- haven't watched anything. Btw police University got negative reviews from this sub.\n\nLee seungi- I absolutely love watching him in variety shows. Mouse is in my twl \n\nYoo yeonseok- I love him! He guested in the vs running man with cha Tae hyun this week and he was an unexpected adorable chaos there. I also recently found out he does musicals too, his hedwig look is so pretty. Fun fact: in his hedwig musical, he danced with his dad as he had to pick a guy from a particular audience section and his dad was the only guy there! He also jokingly showed his hedwig photo to his parents ealier and asked their opinion as he was dating her (himself!) lol. \n\nJeon doyeon: currently watching her in crash course in romance and loved her acting there. She is very natural. \n\nKim heeae- I Googled and first thing that came up was she has 5 baeksangs. Wow\n\nLee joonhyuk- I absolutely loved him as seo dong Jae in stranger. Will be watching his dramas next once I get done with Cho seung woo. I can't believe I discovered these two gems only a few months ago \n\nYoon shiyoon- he is so good with double roles! Also loved him in variety shows\n\nHan jimin- watched her in Hyde, jekyll and me (not really the best drama) and light in your eyes is in my twl but for Nam joohyuk\n\nKim heesun- watched her on faith only \n\nHwang jungeum- watched her in **the undateables** only. It's an okayish drama to lazily kill time. Kill me, heal me is my twl, but for jisung\n\nYang sejong- loved him in temperature of love (drama gets draggy btw) and Dr romantic\n\nAs for namgoong min, I haven't watched many as I mostly watch romcoms. Hot stove league, the veil, doctor prisoner,  one dollar lawyer are most recommended ones, they are also in my twl.",

BUT she also seems to be a really good actor so that's one drama I'm anticipating. \n\nDid you know about Lee Joonhyuk getting his own spinoff?

So excited for the spin-off. Secretly hoping Cho seung woo and Bae doona will also cameo there lol\n\nSadly, musicals aren't uploaded online. Few minutes long unsubbed clips can be found on yt. Trust me, they are worth it. The musicals are also closely adapted from the originals so if you are aware of the original version, it easily becomes comprehensive esp with the acting. I learned that random fact from a vs happy together. Yt has 5-10 mins long highlight clips of most vs, I usually watch them when I am out of drama and my regular vs. Also, if you already haven't, do watch musical clips of Cho seung woo. He is phenomenal!",

An absolutely stunning drama in every way.\r\n\nI didn't know anything about the plot going in and every successive episode blew me away a little bit more. The acting is PHENOMENAL, Greg Hsu and Alice Ko are a case study in how double roles should be done. Unexpectedly it was also a great watch after **Reborn Rich** in terms of past-future isekai &gt;!murder!&lt; mysteries.\r\n\nI was already excited for **A Time Called You** for the casting alone, but now I'm definitely counting down the days. Netflix's production team needs to go all in on this one, the story deserves it. I need to see some Kim Heewon level editing and directing, you feel?\r\n\nI do wonder what \"The Song\" is going to be in the Korean remake. Funny how one song can go from normal to catchy to annoying to horrifying to profound over the course of 13 episodes.",

LOOVED Greg Hsu and thought his portrayal was magnificent.\n\nI\u2019m really looking forward to the Korean adaptation although with some trepidation because it will be hard to live up to the extremely high expectations. \n\nI am confident that Jeon Yeo Bin will deliver, she is very talented and I can imagine her in Alice\u2019s role.  I will admit I am not sold on Ahn Hyo Seop taking on Greg\u2019s difficult role. I feel like the Korean version needs someone who can convey innocence, deep pain, charisma, true love (often simultaneously) and can also pull off the young and older look realistically. I was imagining Ji Chang Wook in this role, I think he would have killed it.\n\nLastly, THIS is how you successfully do a time travel theme (and like you said dual roles) that completely works.",

Jeon Yeobeen and Kang Hoon are gonna kill those roles no problem. As for Ahn Hyoseop, definitely harder to picture, but I think he can do it?\r\n\nI've only ever seen him in **Business Proposal**, and that's certainly not the Greg Hsu vibe. But based on what clips I've seen of **Dr. Romantic**, he seems to pull off the youthful look well enough. And he's Canadian, so he's got that plot point down haha. Just gonna trust the process on this one.",

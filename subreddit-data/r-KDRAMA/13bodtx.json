I feel like in Korea Run on had very slightly worse ratings (high end of average for a JTBC drama, BP had low end of 'good' for SBS) but on the internet I feel like Run On got more hype/love.  \n\n\nThat being said I feel like BP was popular because it was a 'fun' throwback drama with a lot of tropes from old shows from 2012ish that people could enjoy for the comedy and nostalgia, but the couple itself as a result of that was basically really forgettable to me (since it was so trope heavy) and I rarely saw anyone really talking about the main couple, more about the gags/jokes and the secondary couple in the threads I saw about it. Whereas it seems like people REALLY liked the couple in Run On while it was airing, and it was such a unique screen relationship! But I guess you have a better idea of what other people are thinking than I am, I was actually shocked.",

Run on was also airing at the same time as lovestruck in the city back then and the latter got a bit more promotions from Netflix (the swoon) - based on my info it\u2019s because of the star power internationally. Run on also faced a lot of issues with not good subtitles. From what I can tell, a lot of people liked the 2nd lead couple more as well. But yeah I agree that the more talked about stuff in abp is the funny moments rather than the leads. But if you think about it, I think ABP had more viewers and usually regardless of if you think the couples are memorable, if you\u2019ve seen one drama and not seen the other, you\u2019ll probably vote for that drama.",

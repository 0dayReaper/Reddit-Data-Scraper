The bully\u2019s reaction to soon-ae doing well in her exams as it bothered Mi-Suk makes me wonder if there is a link between her and the note in the murder scenes stating \u2018girls reading is dangerous\u2019. Could the note be an indication that because the victims done something to outshine or threaten mi-suk\u2019s status/career they had to be gone?\n\nI dunno, I might not be onto anything but the episodes are adding more mystery to the storyline, I can\u2019t predict anything properly so I\u2019m very excited for the upcoming episodes!",

A very strict and uncaring mother and god knows what that creep of a brother has done to her apart from beating her up for money..\n\nAlso, everybody is talking about how pretty Seo Ji Hye (young mom) is but can we stop for a second to appreciate how pretty Ji Hye Won (young Go Mi Sook) is?

It can be a false trope but I don't think it was said just for it being said. As seems like we are going in circle where we will suspect everyone till we goes back to the start. \n\nSo, Mother of FL knows the killer and that person is a woman. \n\nSo, who is the killer? There's really not so many people or we won't actually see the killer till the end. Can as well we saw her or him but as second character that we do not pay attention.",

I think it's supposed to lead us astray. But why would the student teacher have been talking to him? Are they related? He just moved to the town as well. Perhaps they were both involved in whatever it is that happened, that makes her so afraid. And is she guilty of whatever the crimes are, or has she been framed... or was she, maybe, part of a group and the others did something, and now she's hiding because she knows? But somehow, I think she and Yoon Yong's father must know each other, for whatever reason they are connected in her backstory. I think she trusts him, which is why she was meeting with him - and maybe that's who she was speaking to on the phone... although it seems more likely she was speaking to someone not in the town. \n\nIs there some corruption going on in the police bureau in the town?\n\nHae Joon and Yoon Yong are both making assumptions - Hae Joon about the guy in the hat, and Yoon Yong about her dad. \n\nWhat's going on with Mi Sook and her brother?? She's obviously unhinged. (Or was that scene just acting out the bit that Yoon Yong told Jae Hoon to read in the draft? It wasn't clear.)",

The way this episode (episode 6) is framed, not to mention the differences between Hee-seob in the past and present timeline, seems to indicate that we might actually be looking at something far more sinister than we first thought.\n\nCould it be that Hee-seob figured out the truth about his brother being a psychopath, tried to stop him and ended up getting killed for it? And instead of revealing all this, Yoo-seob took his brother's identity and decided to hide in plain sight, taking on the role of Soon-ae's husband. Yoo-seob's guilt and personality differences caused him to drink constantly and could explain the fights the pair constantly have with a younger Yoon-young in the present.",

This is the themed post for all identification questions and requests, including dramas! \n\nBefore posting in this thread please take a look through our [discussion resources - who/what/which is this section](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/discussionresources#wiki_who.2Fwhat.2Fwhich_is_this.3F) which outlines ways in which you can work out many of these requests for yourself.\n\nYou can ask here for help identifying the following things: Dramas, Actors, Product  Placement (either product or brand), Drama Locations, Clothing,  Accessories, Music (OST or background).\n\nPlease  provide a picture if possible (upload on imgur) and include as much  contextual information as you know (e.g. source drama, broadcast year, episode number and time stamp, etc.).\n\nOnce you have found an answer please edit your original comment to state \"**SOLVED**\" in bold caps at the top so people don't spend time trying to help unnecessarily.\n\n**Please remember to use spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;. For more detailed guidance on spoiler tags and when to use them, check our [Spoiler Tags Tutorial](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags).\n\n\n***Just In Case Resources***\n\n[FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101) and [Netflix FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101/netflix_faqs) **|** [Glossary](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/definitions) **|** [Latest On-Airs](/r/KDRAMA/search?q=flair%3Aon-air&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=week) and [On-Air Roster](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episode_discussion_roster) **|** [Rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules) and [Policies](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/policies) **|** [Where To Watch *aka* Legal Sites](/r/kdrama/wiki/wheretowatchkdramas) **|** [Everything In Our Wiki *aka* Wiki Homepage](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/index) **|** [Get Recommendations For Your Next Watch](/r/kdramarecommends/comments/hl34w7/rules_resources_and_a_guide_to_navigating/)",

In one scene, FL is laughing at the king because he was afraid of an insect (a bee?). She was running around and the ML caught her and asked if she was more afraid of the insect or him. He kisses her and her hair falls out of her hat in a dramatic swirl. In another scene, ML was displeased with FL and tried to make her jealous by having her as an attending servant while he was with one of his concubines. \n\nThis is probably not enough info to go on as I know there are many dramas that follow this plot with the female lead dressing up as a male, but please respond if you have any ideas!",

There was an Asian grocery store that just opened up and had a food court but the food court was very fast food like. I had jajangmyeon there and it very meh. In my mind I was like surely this isn't supposed to taste like this. I was right. A few months later I went to a different place that was a couple of ajummas who were so excited that I ordered it. they went on to tell me that not many people make it the way they do and that they make their own noodles there. She told me that she puts a lot of time into her jajangmyeon, which I ordered in addition to Korean BBQ. Finally it was the taste I was looking for! It was delicious just like I always expected it to be and the owners were so kind and welcoming. It was like family the way she sat there and made sure our bbq came out good. She sat there at the table with us and cooks the BBQ on the grill and served us.\n\n There's more and more Korean places popping up but I've noticed their more fast food oriented and not as good.",

Then you have to eat the onion and pickled radish in-between, maybe like the pickled ginger you eat in-between sushi and sashimi, to wash the palate. If there's leftover sauce, you can add rice and mix it like there's no tomorrow! That's why the instant jjamppong just doesn't cut it for me \ud83d\ude44",

I had a Korean college roommate and was shocked to learn that jjajangmyeon and jjampong were what she considered to be Chinese food. Chinese food is more lightly seasoned and has less sauce than its Korean Chinese counterparts. I actually prefer Korean food to Korean Chinese food.",

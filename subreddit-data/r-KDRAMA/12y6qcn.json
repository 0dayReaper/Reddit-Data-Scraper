Having so many uploaded simultaneously (or close to) when their air in Korea with subtitles already ready is awesome.\n\nCompare that to Disney+ where many regions (including the US where I live) get region locked out of everything.\n\nViki is serviceable and a great deal for the price you pay, but sometimes it can take a while for subtitles to get updated which is killer when you\u2019re left with a cliffhanger and waiting for subs.",

It seems like on-screen graphics are only translated when no one is speaking, so you end up with a weird mismatch of dialogue and onscreen graphics shown. I imagine to new watchers, who are not familiar with Korean Variety shows, it can be off-putting.",

Almost half of it is spoken in English, and the accents are quite thick, so it's a bit hard to follow without paying close attention and reading lips. A short solution for this is changing the subtitles to English CC. The English in CC is actually subtitling the English dub, not Korean, which is why the English dialogue is subtitled. The korean translations are really different, though, compared to the original, so I wouldn't recommend keeping it at the CC after the English dialogue is over. It's a hassle, but if you're really frustrated by it. It's a short-term solution. I agree with you. I also think English should be subtitled in the default audio and subtitles. Besides that, I recommend the show! The only problem I have with it is the English dialogue, cause it seems forced and very awkward imo. Regardless, it is very entertaining. Apparently, it is based on a true story. It kinda reminds me of Narcos (another great show!!), if you've seen. Not nearly as much violence, but it's similar story wise. Narcos is brutal, Jesus fucking christ lol.",

Besides the VIKI translation notes (which I *love*), I tend to get a bit annoyed when Netflix goes for the overall gist instead of literal translation. Like, when they translate \"hyung\" or \"unni\" as \"hey\" or even completely omit the character's name. Or when they translate something like \"please take care of me\" as \"glad to be here\". I know there are other examples but I can't think of them offhand. I really don't know Korean but when I go from VIKI to Netflix, it takes awhile for me to adjust. In that interim period, though, I feel personally insulted, like they're messing up my language. \ud83d\ude04",

The groups on Viki tend to subtitle the songs and considering Kdramas songs are written specifically for that drama, they can have huge impacts on how a scene goes. I appreciate Netflix investing in it, but the songs being untranslated and the lack of hyung and the like to distinguish ways characters view each a DOES other irks me. Also, I love the notes that let me know that a character is suddenly being informal or even rude because that also explains lot about a scene. I will always watch a drama on Viki over Netflix if it's on both... I'd be happy if Netflix offered a cultural immersion option for subtitles that include original titles, songs, and notes. So they can keep the \"Westernized\" version for people who don't care but for those it matters to, we could get the other details",

Sometimes they water down the meaning of some of the dialogue all in an effort to get it in one sentence that the meaning gets lost. Possibly an unpopular opinion, but I would rather have a way more literal translation and have to pause briefly to read it in its entirety as opposed to losing the meaning of what is being said. A huge plus when translator notes are included to give us cultural references which may be missed by a more international audience.",

Subtitle quality eg, grammar, syntax can be a hit and miss at times, more so with Cdramas than KDramas. I also don\u2019t mind waiting a day for English subtitles. Mind you sometimes its not always 100% translated however they do provide this information for you. Overall though I think l Netflix subtitles are consistently better. Probably because they only use professional and paid translators. I get the impression that Viki use volunteer translators a lot. Don\u2019t get me wrong I appreciate the skills, challenges and time required to translate a whole drama and I value and respect their efforts. I could be wrong so would like hear from anyone in the industry to confirm if this true or not.",

It's unpaid labor which Viki profits from, and the company [doesn't have a great relationship with the subbing groups](https://www.vulture.com/article/rakuten-viki-volunteer-stories.html). In 2019 Viki also implemented a translation bot that fills in 'blanks' on subs or provides pre-translations, which there was huge pushback against but it's unfortunately still around.\n\nIn AU, your best bet is to use a VPN to access Viu. They license a large amount of on-air dramas and you can watch their entire catalogue (with adds) for free. You can also watch older, not currently airing dramas on SBS World/Youtube or Cereal/Youtube.",

Disney could take example with some of their dramas to do that. Netflix subs are still atrocious compared to Viki so even if i have to wait a day I would rather.

Clearly some TV dramas are not profitable and everyone is betting on streaming being the more lucrative format going forward.\n\nI find this sad because kdrama is kdrama to a large extent because of the way it\u2019s produced and consumed, which entails 16 episodes airing over 8 weeks. Netflix\u2019s 6/8/10-episode dramas that drop all at once and the pointless season splits do not get me hyped the same way a longer ongoing drama does. These formats provide little space for good character development and slower storytelling that crafts scenes for their own sake rather than as a means to plot advancement. Also while Netflix has introduced thematic variety and grittier content to the world of kdramas, all their various sci-fi thrillers kinda feel the same to me and I hate that they look down on pure romcoms, melos and slice-of-life, three genres that first attracted me to kdrama and that western TV hates.\n\nSo Netflix\u2019s push to make kdramas more and more like their western productions is a double-edged sword for me and if they increasingly take over the production of kdramas with an eye toward global export rather than satisfying domestic audiences, I fear kdramas will lose their artistic specificity and become soulless and generic like most of Netflix\u2019s original content.",

Where Netflix has shone is by producing and showing content that normally wouldn\u2019t air on Korean networks and bringing that to the masses. When it comes to romance and melos they\u2019re probably better off getting them from the networks.\n\nThe 6-8 format is annoying although they have deviated from it at times. Shows like Queenmaker and My Holo Love had 10-11 episode full seasons and were good (well I enjoyed them at least).\n\nI\u2019d say my biggest issue with Netflix is their overblown budgets. This isn\u2019t just a kdrama issue. It\u2019s well-known in the industry that Netflix was splashing the cash around and spending it inefficiently. I hope, with this new investment, that they focus less on big, splashy, expensive dramas (I agree with you that their sci fi stuff has become formulaic and bland) and give us more variety by investing in the cheaper, character driven stuff. Maybe this is how we get more romcoms and melos from them.",

And the value of being able to watch a show on air and engage with a community is priceless; I still miss the halcyon days of Tumblr Kdrama fandom.\n\nAs others mentioned, the written by women largely for women aspect of Kdrama also can't be ignored. Watching a Kdrama for the first time with a FL as fully realized, complicated main character that had meaningful growth (!) within the frame of a story that focused on her and her struggles (!!) with a touching romance on top (!!!) blew me away. With western media, you usually get one out of the three (two if you're lucky) and the romance is the least likely.\n\nWhile Kdramas have their own issues with formulaic stories and tropes, there have been more hits than misses for me overall and I'd hate for that quintessential Kdrama magic to be replaced with grimdark, gritty Netflix brand content.",

I love the slow progression of the storyline which feels natural and especially the music and BGM which is to the point. Giving them a western feel would strip off the unparalleled heart fluttering feelings which kdramas give. And I still believe that 16 episodes each of 1hr+ length is the best. Shorter tv shows don't give much time to the audience (or me at least) to get attached to the characters.",

I would like to watch older shows and movies too, of my favourite stars. Even if I add Prime, I realise choices overall isn't that great. Plus I dont live in the US so that's there too. I'm reluctant to go to websites that are maybe illegal. I'm happy to pay subscription fee. \nI would appreciate your suggestions. Thank you.",

One option you might look into is Viu - it's not available in the US but people on the Kdramas subreddit mention it a lot for shows that are currently airing. Hulu has a very refined list of Kdramas. Also, there's the app iQIYI that you could see if it is available in your area and has anything you might want to watch. I strongly recommend sort of creating lists of shows that you might be interested in, and just googling to see where they are available. You can always sub to one service one month then to another the next so you can access the shows that look interesting to you, rather than keeping multiple subs going. Unfortunately, locating older stuff varies dramatically and sometimes the questionable sites are the ONLY place to find them. Viki is -pretty- good about having a ton though.",

Like, Squid Game felt *very* geared towards Western audiences (or \"global\" as the creator said).\n\nFor me, that means shows that are heavier on graphic sex and violence and lighter on character development and relationship building.\n\nI also see a trend lately where pumping out more shows has mostly just meant (for me) more shows to sift through to find the good stuff. (The visuals are all great, it's more the overall predictability/writing that's leaving me feeling like a lot of shows lack depth.)",

Even All of us are dead had excelled better in their romances angles than some romance dramas. Although I do expect more graphic scenes or whatever to come in the future in kdramas for Netflix but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily cause they\u2019re tryna cater to a western audience or it\u2019s the \u201cNetflix\u201d influence. I honestly think most Korean writers/directors etc lick their lips when given more creative freedom for Netflix produced dramas compared to the cable tv drama. I mean we see how wild they get in the Korean movies they make. It\u2019s not even just Netflix tbh it\u2019s all streaming platforms taking over rn.",

I suffered through Squid Game because I wanted to finally be able to talk about kdramas with people irl. It had some relationship development, but I like more family and friendship focused shows.\n\nBut I completely agree that that stuff isn't exclusive to western shows, I just find that western-influenced shows tend to focus on that to the detriment of the emotional drama between characters. \n\nI just think that it's inevitable that kdramas won't change over time as they're being written to appeal to more overseas audiences.",

She mentioned how Netflix gave her more creative freedom compared to cable tv, so she was able include more gore and violence, which she otherwise wouldn't be able to on cable TV.\n\nEdit: I don't know, this opinion is very popular on these subreddits and I never understood why. Korean films have a lot of dark themes and violence, yet kdramas, that have the same themes and tone on Netflix are \"Americanized\"? It doesn't make much sense to me. I can definitely understand the perspective people have though. It's just something that bugs me lol. \n\nAlso, If I find the article again, I will edit my post. It was a while ago when I read it.",

Or they can watch a remake.\n\nIt's simply that some of the restrictions imposed by the networks will be lifted.  Some of those restrictions are annoying.  \n\nIn any case, it's not like K-Dramas written for the home market will suddenly disappear.

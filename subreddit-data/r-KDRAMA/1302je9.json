    "postText": "Grab yourself a knee rug and a mug of hot chocolate, it's time to reminisce those old time dramas from days gone by of pre-2019. Maybe you were  around when they aired for the first time and want to take a trip down  memory lane by watching them on the box. Maybe it's your first time  through.\n\nThis is our weekly discussion exclusively for those older Korean dramas on your currently watching list. We don't want to hear about the currently hyped dramas here, so please keep it to the older stuff on your watch list.\n\nReminder, **we advocate the use of legal streaming sources wherever possible**. Any comments mentioning illegal sources will be removed and links will lead to bans as per [our rules](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/rules#wiki_linking_to_illegal_sources).  As it is very hard to find many of the really old dramas rather than  asking users \"where are you watching?\", we suggest you instead ask \"did  you find a legal source?\". See [our policies on streaming sites and VPNs here](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/streaming_sites#wiki_vpns).\n\nCrazily enough not everyone has watched these classics yet so **please remember your spoiler tags when discussing major plot points**  or anything you think should be redacted. If you are using Markdown and  not Fancy Pants Editor, the easiest way to create spoiler tags is to  use &gt; ! spoiler content ! &lt; without spaces to get &gt;!spoiler content!&lt;.

It is a solid story, 2017, with good acting. Some romance, some mystery and some crime. Actors: Lee Jong, Suzy and Jung Hae In. It is Suzy\u2019s acting that stands out.",

            "comment": "It happened! I found my all-time favorite sageuk:  **Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth** (2016, 20 episodes). I watched it on KOCOWA in the USA, for reference.\n\nAt certain times, my heart was literally in my throat with fear for some characters In my defense, I had just finished watching **My Country: The New Age**, so I was primed for a lot of death scenes and quixotic victories. \n\n**Summary**: In the kingdom of Silla, a Queen Regent, Queen Jiso (Kim Ji-soo) booted her son Sam Maekjong/Ji Dwi Rang (Park Hyung-Sik) out of the palace at age 7 and sent him into hiding with only his trusty man-at-arms, Pa-O (Yoo Jae-Myung) to guide and protect him. \\[Mr. Yoo is hands-down one of my favorite character actors and he is effing delightful here). Years later, Queen Jiso forms the Hwarang (sort of \"Flower Knights\").\n\nPark Seo-Joon plays (Moo Myung/Sun Woo Rang), an orphan without even a name, raised by a peasant musician (Kim Won-hae as Woo Reuk), along with his BFF, Mak-Moon/Sun-Woo (Lee Kwang-soo in a special appearance). Mak-moon was born in the Sillan capitol, and has a necklace he thinks will help him find his family once he gets inside the capitol. Only problem is, peasants can't go inside without risking beheading, so he and his bestie, Moo Myung have to sneak in. \n\n**Course Correction**:  I'm going to stop summarizing because I realized I'm going to write all day at this rate. It's obviously very complicated but that's why I stopped summarizing. Here are some thoughts instead.\n\n**Glorious, Glorious Fan Service:** I don't know about you, but when I decide to watch a sageuk like this (or like **Flower Crew: Joseon Marriage Agency**, for another example) where pretty much the main draw is hot Top Stars in wigs and 80 pounds of clothing displaying their acting chops, I know what I want. Hwarang knows exactly what it's doing in this regard. Imo, the best moments in the series are the boys of Hwarang interacting. It is like **Descendants of the Sun: Sageuk Edition**, including the shirtlessness, and the show does not disappoint.\n\nThrough the course of Hwarang you will get: mass shower scenes, fully choreographed dance numbers, heart-felt confessions, tormented \"I tried to quit you but I can't\" admissions, and so very much bro-bonding.\n\nOne line about each of the boys:\n\n* Sunwoo (Park Seo-joon) is the ML, the ultimate strong, silent type. He's perfect for this role, and I wish they'd given him a different FL.\n*  Jidwi (Park Hyung-Sik) is the suave 2ML, whose arrogance is a total put-on given that he's the faceless King and has never had a friend before. omg my heart. \n* Soo Ho Rang (Minho). OMG Sooho is adorable. He is the f\\*ck-boi of the group, but the best kind, and his crush on Queen Jiso is so cute. His advice on how to treat your sister is hilarious and leads to some great physical comedy.\n* Ban Ryu Rang (Do Ji-han) is the tormented Tybalt to Sooho's Benvolio, trying desperately to earn the approval of not just his dad, but his adoptive dad, Park Youngsi (Kim Chang-wan in the kind of cackling evil old man role that he makes sing). A rival of Sooho, Banryu &gt;!also falls for Sooho's sister, Soo-yeon (Lee Da-in, who is delightful).!&lt;\n* Yeo Wool Rang (Jo Yoon-woo). An absolute beautiful man icon, Yeowool reminded me a lot of Do Joon (Byeon Woo-seok) from FC:JMA but in only the best ways.\n* Han Sung Rang (Kim Tae-hyung). Stunt casting at its finest, V from BTS is everything. He is adorable, conflicted, bubbly... just a living puppy who will steal your heart.\n* Dan Se (Kim Hyun-joon) is Hansung's older but \"half-breed\" (in the context of the show's \"Sacred Bone\" series of pure bloodedness) brother who suffers a lot of abuse.\n* Pa-o (Yoo Jae-myung): Yes, Pa-o deserves to be on this list! &gt;!In one of my favorite twists, Pa-O joins Hwarang as a disciple, so he can serve Jidwi, the faceless King. To join, Pa-O insists he's 22 years old (the actor was 42 at the time) and plays it up hilariously.!&lt;\n\n**Yikes, the FL:**  So if you read any reviews of Hwarang, Go Ara's FL, A-ro, is pretty universally disliked. While I wouldn't put her in my Top 10 Most Annoying FLs Ever (looking at you, Jo Yang-sun (Lee Yu-bi) from **The Scholar Who Walks the Night**, and you, Park Hye-ji (Son Na-eun) from **Cinderella and the Four Knights**!), she is pretty bad. She seems to do 96% of her acting with the chin she unfortunately doesn't have. \n\nOMG Yes &gt;!The Incest is Unnecessary and Distracting!&lt;. The show makes it clear early on that the upper class (the \"Sacred Bones\") regularly intermarries to keep the bloodline as pure as possible, and in fact, the badass Princess Sookmyung (Seo Yea-ji) is betrothed to her brother, the faceless King. See bulleted list of head canon ideas below for why this whole thing is distracting and off-putting and for no good reason.\n\n**What is Amazing:**  Most of the acting is stellar, the writing is great, the pacing is fast, the fight scenes are incredibly acrobatic, and the drama is thick and syrupy, like fake blood. Despite it being a 2016 release, sageuks tend to hold up better anyway because we don't have a lot of expectations for the politics of a world where they still regularly behead people and laugh about it.\n\n**Bad Dad Awards:**  Every dad and grandad in this show sucks. It's a master class in terrible parenting. The moms generally get off lighter, with the notable exception of Queen Jiso.\n\n**tl;dr:**  Best sageuk I've seen (that didn't have zombies; I grade **Kingdom** on a different scale). If you can ignore the FL completely, you'll thank yourself. Concentrate on Minho.\n\n**Head Canons!** I rearranged some story elements in my head after bingeing, so these are just a couple ideas that helped me feel better about some of the story:\n\n* &gt;!Delete the Actual Incest. There's no reason to have it in the story at all. Even if incest is acceptable in the upper classes, A-ro is a half-breed and so is her \"brother\", Sunwoo, so their procreating would be even worse off in the caste system. !&lt;\n* &gt;!Reconfigure the Relationship Dynamic in the OTP and 2TP. Keep Princess Sookmyung's betrothal to a never-met-as-adults King. Instead of the Princess falling for Sunwoo, have her fall for Jidwi but they can't be together because she's betrothed! To Jidwi! Instead of catching feelings, let Sunwoo and the Princess develop a deep sibling bond over their shared illnesses - in fact, make the Princess older than Sunwoo and have her be his actual sister. So instead of a boring love quadrangle that goes nowhere, we'd have a deep sibling relationship between the ML and 2FL, a frustrated romance couched in misunderstanding between the 2FL and 2ML, and a stronger OTP (cut down on the OTP scenes a lot, too). Also, since A-ro is the only person who can soothe Jidwi's insomnia, have them develop a deep sibling bond - or better yet already have one developed over his naps at her storytelling sessions - and that way all our leads end up happy and with strong sibling bonds, instead of the weird mess we got. Plus then we can end the series with a wedding between King and Princess, and all of Hwarang could do another dance number!!&lt;\n* &gt;!Give Queen Jiso severe pregnancy-related depression. Hear me out: the Queen is a great character but her motivations seem to fall on the \"mothers be crazy\" side and with no real changes to the story or plot and just a change in the head canon, it made her actions that much more explainable and tragic, keeping in mind that understanding and excusing are not the same thing; I was really thinking the King would cement his power by executing his own mom when he first took the throne, but for some reason in this drama, it's another one of those Kings that can't seem to execute anybody! I was lied to by Shakespeare to think monarchs could just lop off all the heads. Anyway, if you watch the scenes of the Queen's perfidy with the mindset that she is clinically unstable, it makes her a truly tragic figure.!&lt;",

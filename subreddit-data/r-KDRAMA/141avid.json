    "postText": "Dear /r/KDRAMA, \n\nDid you know there are five seasons in a year? Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and Census? Not necessarily in that order. We are about to take our ninth annual community census and below are some reminders, facts, and rules for you as we embark on yet another enlightening journey about ourselves. \n\n*****\n*****\n\n#What is the r/KDRAMA Census?\n\nIt's a fun yearly survey/questionnaire, it started out as a nice icebreaker back in the day and slowly morphed into a cross-section peek into the community. The census is divided into two parts. Part one contains your standard demographic questions (things like age, education, geographic location, etc.). Part two contains questions about how long you've been a part of the community, how often you interact, k-drama preferences, what you use to watch k-dramas, etc.\n\nThe census is administered via Google Forms and the responses are recorded in a linked spreadsheet. It is 100% anonymous (we don't collect usernames or email addresses).\n\nEveryone is encouraged to take this survey and any member of our community can take it. There are no membership length requirements to be eligible for the /r/KDRAMA Census.\n\n#How is this information used?\n\nWe (mods) share the results to everyone in an announcement post. If there's little to clean up and categorize, it happens fairly quickly. We might make special reports and charts if we see important trends or have data that requires a bit of explaining.\n\n#I haven't been here that long or I don't participate often. How long do I have to wait before I can take the census?\n\nYou can start immediately! There are questions that ask you if you're new here, how long you've watched dramas, how often you visit us, so you will belong to a group or several when all is said and done. You won't be skewing anything and you don't need to do anything significant to feel like you belong here.\n\n#How long do I have to take the census? What if I want to change my responses?\n\n**The census period is from [June 05] to [July 05] KST. You can go back and change any response while the survey form is open.** You don't have to tackle it all in one go. Take a few questions here and there or chop it up over the week. Just remember to answer everything you want before it's over!\n\n**How to edit your responses:**\n\nIt is possible to save your progress so you do not have to complete in one session, you can come back to edit your responses until voting closes on [July 05] KST.\n\nFor the census form, when you get to the last section (page) and click 'Submit' -- you will see a page that says \"Your response has been recorded\" and an \"Edit your response\" link which looks like [this](https://i.redd.it/dq8hodeui34b1.png).\n\nThat \"Edit your response\" link is an individualized URL link, please save that URL link so that you can come back and further complete or change your previous choices. **Please verify you have properly saved the link before closing your initial submission page!**\n\nThis \"Edit your response\" link is available ***without*** signing into a Google account.\n\nWhen you revisit the voting form through your individualized URL link, you will see a notice that says \"You're editing your response. Sharing this URL allows others to also edit your response.\" that looks [like this](https://i.redd.it/6rq43ebtsw881.png).\n\nAlternatively, signing in with a Google account will also allow you to save your progress and edit your choices. Please note, we will not receive any sign in information or your Google account name as our voting form **does not** require such information.\n\n*****\n*****\n\n#General Instructions\n\n   * Read answer choices or categories thoroughly before answering \"Other\" **PLEASE READ ALL AVAILABLE CHOICES.**\n\n   * Please read any question descriptions or sub-titles, as they explain how to answer or what you should consider when answering questions.\n\n   * We strive for inclusion and support, especially with our questions on things like ancestry/ethnicity, gender and sexuality. For these questions we have tried to include a range of answer choices that are representative while balancing out the need for brevity in our census form. If you have feedback on how we can better improve these questions or choices, please leave a comment.\n\n   * Do not panic when you see the census is 16 pages long, a large number of them are world region specific and you skip them! \n\n   * **Please only complete the census once**\n\n*****\n*****\n\n#Changes to the 2023 r/KDRAMA Census\n\nIn 2022 we did a massive overhaul of the census so in comparison this year's changes are minimal and are mostly based on last year's user feedback. The following changes have been made:\n\n* Increased the amount of age range sections\n\n* Updated the language around gender\n\n* Changed \u201cSouthern Asian\u201d to \u201cSouth Asian\u201d\n\n* Changed \u201cTurkey\u201d to \u201cT\u00fcrkiye (Turkey)\u201d\n\n* Added Unable to work due to disability, Self Employed and Contractor options in the employment section\n\n* Added Arabic to the subtitle language options\n\n* Added the Post Covid Lockdown Era to our data collection regarding viewing habits\n\n* Updated selection of legal streaming sources\n\nAs you take the census, if you have any feedback/suggestions, please leave a comment on this post and we will take it into consideration for next year's census.\n\nIf you encounter any questions, also leave a comment in this form by starting your comment with 'Mods, I have a question.' A member of the mod team will respond to your question (usually within 24 hours).\n\n---\n\n#Ready to take the census? The link is ---&gt; [HERE](https://forms.gle/QPqDMDZE9M35q8hF7) &lt;---",

But I believe the distinction is important because I wasn't first introduced to kdramas in general by Netflix; I already knew of them. However, I did start watching kdramas because of a Netflix recommendation.\nIn addition, the question asking about our viewing pattern and when it started and how it relates to the covid lockdown period is a tricky question for me, and possibly other people. I did start watching kdramas in 2020 during lockdown. But it wasn't related to covid for me personally, in any way. I know a lot of people started watching kdramas during lockdown, being stuck at home. And I also know this subreddit started growing quickly because of that/related to the increase of kdrama watchers. However, it isn't accurate for me personally, as I had already been working from home for 2 years, and my viewing habits of anything were not related to covid lockdown. And only coincidentally started watching kdramas during covid, only because of a recommendation made by Netflix that sounded good (King Eternal Monarch) in April.\nMaybe the distinction isn't enough to make a difference, as there may not be enough of us where covid was not a factor. But I remember the same question from last year's census and how it didn't accurately account for or represent my personal experience. So I thought it didn't hurt to mention it.\nWonderfuly census, always look forward to the results! And I'm thankful for how great our mods are! We sure are a lucky subreddit to have them! \u263a",

            "comment": "Surveys like this are fun; thanks for creating and updating it.\n\nWith the questions about being introduced to K-drama - the fact that it exists (this is an interesting option, and a good idea) - it would be nice to also have questions about first being introduced to the idea of watching it ourselves, because this is different. As in, I knew, vaguely, that people watched Korean drama series. But it didn't lead me to want to watch them. It was a suggestion on Netflix, which I was using at the time, which led me to watch one series, and that series led me to watch others, which led me to start watching more. I no longer use Netflix, but that's how I started watching them. However, there's only the question(s) about how we were introduced, and then when we started watching. The question about starting to watch via Netflix is headed with 'if you have Netflix', which I don't.\n\nFor future censuses, could you not use 'cisgender'? This is not a term that most women would use to describe themselves, but one used by those who identify with various other gender designations to describe those who do not, or used by those who study gender with an applied postmodern lens, which is a niche and contested persepective. Outside of that niche, 'cisgender' is a meaningless/unpleasant/somewhat offensive term for the rest of us. Just regular 'woman', or 'female' works. Since it's us describing ourselves, I think it's fair.\n\nI know a lot of people started watching during what you're calling 'the COVID era', but this might assume that people started watching *because of* that, and not just at the same time as. Is there anyone else like that? \ud83d\ude42\ud83e\udd14 For example, I started because I was tired of everything else on Netflix and other sources, and I was already watching streaming TV - from before this period. Perhaps a question about why we started would be interesting? Or a question along with the one about the period we started watching, to say whether this influenced our choice to begin or not.",

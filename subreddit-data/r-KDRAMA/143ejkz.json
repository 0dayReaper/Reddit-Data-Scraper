My 2 favs from last round (the Devil Judge OST and the Meebo/Primary Weak Hero song) are both out and this has happened literally every round!!  \n\n\nAs a musician I'm heartbroken! I think it's so much harder to write music that creates a 'unique mood' for a show than something that's just a pretty ballad or happy poppy song but it seems like most of those 'moody' songs are getting eliminated immediately. Sad.",

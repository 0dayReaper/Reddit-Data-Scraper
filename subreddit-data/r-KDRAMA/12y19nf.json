    "postText": " I imagine most of you reading this have never heard of this show, despite its popularity or have heard it in passing. To be fair, its name \u2018First Love\u2019 is about as vague and non descript as you can get, but my issues with the names of k-drama\u2019s aside, I\u2019ll continue on with my point. First Love was a huge success in 1996. So much in fact that it\u2019s the second HIGHEST RATED drama of all time. It avarged 52.6% of Korean audiences throughout its run which was 66 episodes (50 minutes each). Huge. At one point, it had a peak audience of 65.8%. Imagine 65% of a country that owns a TV watching something. Despite this, it didn\u2019t get many awards. The only one I could find at first glance (and I mean first glance) was a popularity award for Bae Yong-joon (Winter Sonata), who only got more popular from here and is well known. If there is any 90s K-Drama star well known today, it\u2019s likely him. One thing I\u2019d like to address is that synopsis on wikipedia and other places. Some of it is incorrect. It implies a love triangle between the brothers, which is false. There is one but not with Bae Yong-joon\u2019s character, Sung Chan-woo. Rather it's between Sung Chan-hyuk (Choi Soo-jong, Emperor of the Sea) and Park Sung-won (Sandglass or It's Beautiful Now - something more recent that was popular). Chan-woo had liked Lee Hyo-kyung (Lee Seung-yeon) as a kid and decided to push those aside fairly quickly. Spoilers, Chan-woo and Hyo-kyung hardly speak during the time where Chun-hyuk is disabled. So I\u2019m not sure what those people watched but it wasn\u2019t this show. \n\nThe story is part love story and part revenge story. It\u2019s largely about a brewing romance that begins between two kids well into their adulthood that is constantly challenged and thwarted by Hyo-kyung\u2019s uncle and father, who do everything without resorting to murder to keep them apart due to their class differences. He is sent to the arm, beat up, forced to run away and even disabled via a car accident. In the background, Chan-woo struggles to get through law school due to financial difficulties and family problems, flirting with a brewing romance of his own with Kang Suk-hee (Choi Ji-woo, Stairway To Heaven) that is sadly underdeveloped, although a really interesting sub plot of the show, which makes it a pain that it didn\u2019t really lead anywhere despite small glimpses of what could be. Chan-woo goes on his own path on revenge and that is that. He eventually succeeded, all while learning forgiveness and all that good hearted crap. \n\nThe Chan-woo character is the heart of the show and carries it through its lulls, which this definitely has. The pacing of the plot was too heavy in the beginning and the end and not enough during the 35-45 stage. There were plenty where little took place or developments were repeated for brevity sake. The introduction of a side character called Ju Jung-nam (Son Hyun-joo, The Good Detective) allowed more depth for the Chan-ock, the sister and some plot outside of the main story. It was entertaining but the plot was a little all over the place. You never knew where he stood with Chan-ock. It was back and forward. If I had to continue talking about the side characters, the characters were fine but the stories often went nowhere. 66 episodes and none of them felt completed. Shame. Not crippling to the show but disappointing. Nevertheless, the overarching story was interesting enough to hook me into actually completing the show. I\u2019ve struggled to complete 12 episode dramas before, and I tend to like those. So it must have been good. The story isn\u2019t totally tight from episode to episode but they rarely are. Of course, the acting generally is what attracts people and Bae Yong-joon, Choi Soo-jong, Park Sung-won are great as leading men throughout this. Lee Seung-yeon is fine as the main lead. She can do a nice cry scene. I think she was a more interesting character when trying to portray a teenager. Perhaps it\u2019s because her role was more intertwined with Choi Soo-jong. Park Sung-won really captured my attention for Sandglass and he was really good in his friendly other man role. He had a few plots where he had to show a more depressive, conflicted state and it was captured well. The star is Bae Yong-joon, easily. He\u2019s really good in anything, even if some of his later works are a tad melodramatic for my preference. And this is just the start. \n\nThe music in the show changes between classic folksy music to more contemporary tunes. Nothing amazing. Not a patch on Sandglass which has a fantastic, iconic OST (check it out) but there are some ear wigglers here and there. \n\nRecommended. While not amazing, it\u2019s a good show with a strong leading man and a couple of solid side characters. And while I\u2019ve not mentioned it much, the antagonists were solid too. And their comeuppance is sweet.",

Unbelievable.",

There is no unnecessarily complicated plot or makjang twist but a great writing doesn't need it. \nThe whole 66 episodes didn't bore me at all.",

Both of their characters are inconsistent. Lee Gyeom would make a better King.",

It feels like San has been hiding the whole time plotting revenge protected by the Watchman, but does not have a plan. Yoo Ha was protected by the fact nobody even knew he existed but became very politically savvy.\n\nI wonder whether that passage on a ship to China could become a reality and would be a more appropriate end at this point. But they still have 4 episode to shuffle things around.\n\nEither way Shi Yeol is the King's bodyguard or gets a high position (without passing the state exam \ud83d\ude02).",

I had soo many theories in mind why it shouldn't happen. But after watching today's episode, i think yoha would actually be a better king than san, like seriously after years of planning this is what you come up with? That one special day, i'll just go and shoot an arrow at him and he'll be dead then i'll be the king with my sweet little danoh. And shi yeol just passing time with hong ju when he should be out there gaurding san. They'll send a troupe just to kill an unarmed lady, cmon boy, 2 would be morrre than enough even if you want to be sure. San seems the one without a plan, with just the goal to eliminate the king, while yoha is actually thinking politically as a king. Idk of the ending the show is gonna give, but i think the bookish ending seems good for now.!&lt;",

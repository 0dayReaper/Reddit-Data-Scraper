During the investigation, he comes across the decade's largest fraud case, a five trillion won swindle that defrauded tens of thousands of people eight years ago. Unfortunately, at the time of the fraud, the scammer, Noh Sang Cheon (Ho Sung Tae), who carried out his scheme by forming Bigs Network, died in a car accident while fleeing to China.",

I\u2019ve noticed the same thing with other dramas eg Big Bet.    Hopefully these last two episodes will pull me back in.",

I usually forget a lot between Seasons but those episodes were perfect.\n\nGoing forward, the lead has to do more of these roles. Not many lead Korean actors convince me as Detectives but he absolutely does.",

He was great in this role as detective. It was a great drama with great lead actors. However sometimes I felt there were too many flashbacks \n\nHowever they should stop the practice of splitting dramas in 2 parts. I can somehow accept a one month break max, but not longer, because otherwise I tend to forget the details.",

He wanted to break away from his rom-com persona and boy did he achieve that in Bait.   He pretty much disappeared into the character even going so far as to use facial hair to try and downplay his looks (didn\u2019t work lol).   Now that he has proved his acting chops I would love to see him in a serious role that also allows him to showcase his charm and humour.",

I had two problems with the last episode: one, I am so sick of the victims\u2019 outrageous behavior and must admit I agree with the villain that their greed made them invest to begin with and to keep trying to find him to get their money back.   Second, I never believed the villain &gt;!was as old and frail as he pretended!&lt; and it didn\u2019t make sense that such a well planned and complicated plot would be destroyed by the need &gt;!for an overly complicated revenge on the victims!&lt;.

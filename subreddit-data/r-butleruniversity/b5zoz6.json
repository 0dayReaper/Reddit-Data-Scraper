I want find a quite place to study in the evening during the week(after 7pm, maybe also weekends).\nI visited the Ervin library and it is awesome.\n\nI checked the Butler parking service website and it says I need a permit in the campus even during the nights.\n\nIs there other options I can utilize? (shops with free parking, meters, etc)\n\nAny help is appreciated!\n",

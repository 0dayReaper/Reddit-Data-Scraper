    "postText": "I'm a Varsity middle infielder and pitcher who is currently a junior. I'm being looked at by a few D2 schools and a local D1 school, but I haven't been given any firm offers. How was the recruitment process for you? Were you offered by many schools before Butler? Did you contact Butler or did they contact you? What are the athletic and academic requirements to play at Butler? I'm from the Chicago area, but I moved away to NC in middle school and I want to come back to the midwest for college, so if you're from out of state, how was that process? Thanks!",

I was there for the previous directors final year and audition process for Clark - the current director. Maestro Clark is a great guy. His conducting can be\u2026\u2026 interesting. But, he knows his stuff and knows what he wants. \n\nThe audition process, when I was there, included excerpts from the pieces that were programmed that semester. So if you were playing Beethoven 9, there was probably going to be an excerpt from Beethoven 9 on the audition. It wasn\u2019t the same as a \u201creal\u201d audition where they would expect to hear the standard audition rep. I think this is for two reasons - 1: they want to hear the big moments that you\u2019re actually going to play that semester so they can tell who is going to sound good on the solo. And 2: because, honestly, Butler doesn\u2019t always attract the largest talent pool when compared to other schools. So you ask a freshman trumpet player to play Petrushka\u2026 it\u2019s gonna sound bad. Of course this isn\u2019t always the case and the ensembles always sound good by concert time \u2026 just my experience.",

I\u2019m from a fairly big high school and managed to be 2nd chair in our orchestra but I\u2019m stressed I\u2019ve lost some of my ability because of my first college. Do you know if the audition \u201cjudges\u201d are looking for perfection or more so the ability to play in a way that could benefit the ensemble and improve over time?",

Yes they care about perfection more than potential. If you\u2019re going to win a principal chair, they want someone who they know will have their part down and can lead. Someone with potential is an unknown and they impacts the entire orchestra. \n\nMy advice - get a metronome and practice with it. Know the excerpts so we\u2019ll that you can\u2019t miss. Start slow and use your metronome. Don\u2019t enforce bad habits by practicing it wrong. Play it slow enough that you play it perfect. Then speed up. Repeat.",

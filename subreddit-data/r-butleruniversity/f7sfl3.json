    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nLast night I was at Clowes Memorial Hall with my girlfriend to see a show. She woke up this morning and was unable to find her wallet. We have been calling around and think she may have left it at the theater. I have tried to call the theater and the university, but their offices are closed Saturday-Sunday. Would it be worth it for me to drive up to the university?  Any tips? It is kind of an urgent thing because if it is not there, we will have to start ordering my girlfriend new cards, ID, ETC. Any help is appreciated!",

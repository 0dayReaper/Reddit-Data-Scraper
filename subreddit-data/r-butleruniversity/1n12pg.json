You have to understand that the students there don't want to be pushy, but that the manager listens in randomly on calls, and if they don't keep going, they'll get written up/fired.  \n\nHere's what you do, when they call say \"I would like to be removed from you phone and mailing list (say both!!!)\"  Note the date.  If they call again, tell them you requested to removed from the phone list on (insert date here), and if they call again you will report them to Better Business B.  The manager might even come in on the call to ensure you it will be removed from the list.\n\nNote, this only removes you from the list for 7 years.  Again, sorry.  I didn't design the system.  Just worked there for Booze money.",

Almost everyone who works there is a student at your alma mater and just nervous, young, and on the phone with upset alumni. Giving 1$ on a credit card really does help us out! \n2. When you do really want to help your university with a large gift, dont give it through them! because you will get more calls and garbage from them and really every uni should fund raise in house",

Schedule some really tough games like Alabama or Clemson. They would lose but get attention. In 10 years or so, BOOM",

There are probably \\~ 7 schools that have D1 programs with under 10,000 undergrad, and even fewer under 5,000, some of which are service academies if I'm not mistaken. They would also have to build a new football stadium. ",

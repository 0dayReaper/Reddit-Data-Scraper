College basketball is huge at Butler, the team is known nationwide. \u201cGreek life\u201d (sororities fraternities) is active, you won\u2019t have time to join in 1 semester so just make friends with some members and you\u2019ll get invited to their parties.",

There is definitely an active social life with clubs, sports, campus life etc given everyone lives on but if you\u2019re ideal is what is portrayed in movies I feel like you might be disappointed. Loved Butler myself, but I\u2019m not someone who spent more than 1-2 nights out a week if that helps.",

The delusion that they're somehow a \"superior\" team goes hand in hand with the necessary will it must take to continue to live in Cincinnati. \n\nThe idea that Butler plays as dirty is also absurd. Of the two schools, only one of them starts fights on the court, gets verbally abusive with elderly fans and trashes school property when they don't get there way, and it isn't the Bulldogs.",

    "postText": "Hi fellow Butler students. We have several good home games coming up against some top level teams. We're gonna need to make Hinkle a tough place to play and have every student up on their feet cheering. No reason why any student should be sitting (even in the upper level). Why not do a white out or something, I'm sure we could run it by athletics or put posters up around school. I know we already have the dawg pound shirts which are a unified color, but theres nothing like a white out. I'm thinking maybe against Villanova or Georgetown. Thoughts?",

It's upwards of $40,000 to get t shirts for everybody. \n\nThat being said, I think for the Villanova game, Dawg Pound is getting white shirts and all the other fans will be encouraged to wear white. Apparently people usually turn out pretty well for those kind of things so it should work out in the end.",

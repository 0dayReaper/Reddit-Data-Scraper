(can't remember exactly which). we gave that possession away.\n\nso many missed opportunities. we got a few bad calls for sure, but none near enough to blame for the loss.\n\nwe got lucky with that out of bounds call late in OT, from replay it was pretty clearly out on Kam. then what happened? we turned it over on the shitty inbound pass. two 3-pointers all game? gross.\n\n3 turnovers in final 2 minutes? we gave up only 4 in the first 43 minutes.\n\nfirst time in 9 years we've lost 4 in a row. something's gotta change. not to mention how many Georgetown bigs fouled out? three? plus another one of their guys was out from injury, another for academic reasons.\n\ndifference in points in the paint was sad as well. if we get shutdown down low, we should be able to take advantage on the outside, but we couldn't.\n\nnot to mention that Georgetown's ball movement was incredible.\n\nthat all being said, i feel bad for the players, and even worse for the seniors. this isn't what they deserve.\n\n&lt;/rant&gt;\n\ni'm gonna go get a drink.\n\n*drops mic*",

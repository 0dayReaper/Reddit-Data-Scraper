For the dorms we had to have meal plans, downstairs Atherton was open to the public and you could pay cash or your card, but I thought I remembered the dorm cafeterias (Ross/Upstairs Atherton) you had to use your ID which had the balance of your meal plan.  I dont remember them taking cash, but then again I never needed to so didnt pay attention.",

    "postText": "Hi! I am a freshman this year at butler and my family and I decided that it would be best if I commuted, at least for the first semester/year, to Butler. I don't really have a problem with the idea of staying home since my house isn't too far (about 25 min). What I am afraid of though is not being able to take part in the university and clubs as much as someone who is dorming. I don't like the idea of being someone who just goes to classes then goes home. Any tips from someone who has commuted before? Any ideas how I can get the full experience of the campus and social life while living off campus? Thank you in advance!",

Eventually you'll start to make friends in your classes and run into them around campus the more you're around. It's hard to replace the experience of living on campus entirely but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try. Good luck next year, I hope you love it",

Orientation week is good time to be able to see all the clubs Butler has to offer and try to join one (this will make you have to stay on campus for meetings and what not.) In between the huge gaps of time between classes (depending on how you set up your scheduler) try going to the HRC and playing a pick up game or just talk with people.  Once you meet people in class it will be easier to get in touch with them outside of class.  You should be fine.  I graduated in 2007\n",

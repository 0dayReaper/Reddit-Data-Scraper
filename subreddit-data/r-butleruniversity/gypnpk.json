And then this evening, President Danko sent an email to all students regarding his stance on this \"disturbing photo\". \n\nJust curious, does anyone know what this is in context to?",

In the replies, it comes out that Athletics knew about the photo when she was given a spot on a team, though her teammates did not.  The University has certainly done a whole lot of nothing about it, that\u2019s for sure.",

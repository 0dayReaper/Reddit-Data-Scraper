I'm going to be a junior this next year and I have some questions about AV that I can't find anywhere online and frankly, I'm too lazy to call resident life.\n-Are there RA/CAs in AV? \n-Do we get an earlier move in date than Ross/Resco/Irvington/Fairview? \n-Are we allowed to stay in the apartments over breaks?\nThanks for answering my questions!!",

Housing contracts are supposed to start August 1 and end like at the end of May or something, but of course with the virus don\u2019t count on anything until it\u2019s explicitly told to you.  And no, you don\u2019t have to apply for break stay during any breaks - it\u2019s treated like you\u2019re a tenant so you can come and go as you please, including staying over holidays.",

I enjoyed living in AV, it is really nice to \u201cgo home\u201d to the apartment and feel like you\u2019re actually leaving campus. It definitely feels more grown up than resco",

    "postText": "I will be coming in as a junior from the Chicago area.  I'll be studying History with minors in French and either International Business or Economics.  I'm not sure which yet.  Last semester I was at Monmouth College, in western Illinois and now I'm at a community college.  I have all of my Area of Inquiry courses done (except PWB).  \n\nWhat can you guys tell me about living on campus?  My first choice of housing was the Apartment Village, but I don't know how likely I am to get that.  What are my chances?  \n\nWhat do you guys do on the weekends?  How is the school spirit?  Judging from the front page of this subreddit, basketball is an awfully big deal.  :P  I guess my biggest question is: what do I need to know to succeed at Butler?",

When I was there, both AV and Resco were decent (AV being newer/nicer).\n\nSucceed? Embrace the school, embrace the city. Indy is pretty awesome, really.\n\nWeekends? Broad Ripple, Holcomb Garden, downtown, pretty awesome art museum. 38th street, if you're feeling brave. [Babes](https://local.yahoo.com/info-15928749-babes-showgirls-indianapolis) if you're feeling even more brave.\n\nGet involved in campus activities. I regret not doing more of that when I was there (though I was in a fraternity).\n\nDon't get caught in Schwitzer after hours (assuming you're a dude). But props if you do.\n\nGo to an Out of the Dawg House concert. again... biased, former member ;)\n\nAlso, when the weather is nice... just go out and enjoy the campus, it's absolutely gorgeous.\n\nIf you're a party person/socialite... go out. bars, frats, house parties, whatever. I love driving through campus and seeing everyone out and about.\n\nYou MUST jump in the star fountain at least once. Bonus points for running away from BUPD in the act. Double bonus points for not being sober.\n\nI would say enjoy Dominic the Donkey from TKE, but they're not around anymore and that makes me sad.\n\nGo to Holcomb Observatory. Seriously.\n\nIs C-Club still a thing? If so, befriend at least 1 of the workers. Trust me.\n\nIf you drink, get drunk on the knoll at some party at some point.\n\nGo to a concert at Clowes.\n\nGo to a Butler ballet performance, they're seriously incredible.\n\nGo and appreciate the technology in the pharmacy building, because I installed and set up just about all of it (when it was new).\n\nSigned, a faithful mod and forever Butler Bulldog.",

[This is my view walking to class every day](https://twitter.com/BU_NeonHat/status/421395791438045184/photo/1)\n\nHow to succeed? GO TO OFFICE HOURS WITH YOUR PROFESSORS. I rarely do this and it's a little late for me now (I'll be a senior in the fall), but trust me on this. Go every week even if you don't have any questions. Talk to them about life as a transfer, ask them about internships, literally anything. Just go, as someone who wishes he'd been more proactive it will make all the difference.\n\nAlso on academics, as a current business major, I highly recommend NOT minoring in Economics. The econ professors are downright terrible. Trust me on this.\n\nWeekends = whatever you make it to be. There's parties at Greek houses, half a dozen bars right down the road in Broad Ripple, and waaay more stuff downtown. Butler is only 4.5 miles from downtown and 3 miles from B-Ripp so theres lots of opportunities for stuff to do. If drinking isn't your thing, there's plenty of malls, museums, theaters within a 10-15 miles radius. Grab some friends and go check out all Indy has to offer. Party in your apartment too, they're great for that.\n\nSchool spirit is awesome. Can't explain it any more than that.\n\nFor your PWB, there is a class which you should try and get into at some point called Wagging, Walking, and Wellness. In this class you literally walk dogs. That is the class. Wish I could have gotten in to it. It also satisfies the Indianapolis Community Requirement for Butler (don't know if you'll have to do that as a transfer though).",

Is there ethnic food, family restaurants, etc.? I'm mostly familiar with the (primarily) generic restaurants and stores in Castleton. I do love Skyline, though. \n\nWhat were your favorite classes that you took/why? And what were your favorite moments at Butler thus far?",

Personally I don't go out eat too much other than for fast food every now and then. But there's some good Chinese and Thai take out places, there's a really good German restaurant and beer garden downtown called the Rathskeller, basically whatever you're looking for will be there. Indy's a fairly large city (tiny compared to Chi town I know...) so with a little research you'll be able to find anything you want.\n\nMy favorite classes have been the ones that get me involved rather than just lecture. As a business major, I tend to have a lot more of these classes than other majors. A lot of the times it just depends on the professor; don't rely on it but definitely check out ratemyprofessor.com for some student reviews.\n\nHands down favorite moment at Butler was the basketball team's buzzer beater over Gonzaga in Hinkle during ESPN's College Game Day last year ('12-'13). I also had the chance to study abroad in New Zealand for fall semester this year, so that was an amazing experience as well.",

I highly recommend this especially since the apartments have pretty nice full kitchens (oven, range, micro, fridge, dishwasher). Shopping is an easy 10-15 minutes away with Kroger, Target, Marsh, Walmart, Aldi, etc.\n\nHere's part of an email from the housing coordinator I got when I was debating going all access or commuter plan in January.\n\n&gt;\"I do get what you are saying about spending money on food.  We just always caution apartment students against the full meal plan because usually they do not end up using it enough to make it worth the price.  The All Access plan costs $2980.  That is $186 per week.  If you had that in cash, you could spend much less at the grocery store and then cooking for yourself.  Even if you paid $885 for a commuter meal plan like I described before, you would still have $2095 left or $130 per week.\"",

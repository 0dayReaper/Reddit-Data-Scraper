            "comment": "I did a semester there in spring 2013. Man I wish I could go back. Butler is a small school maybe 4K people so its a pretty close community. When given the option live in the apartment village not ResCo. Get involved with campus. Make friends outside of the international students. Go to basketball games, go to frat parties. Be over 21 when you go. I still see friends that I made on my semester across the world two years later, you'll have a great time there. Also with academics, I found the academics to be way easier than at home (Sydney) you'll mostly have professors or tenured Doctors teaching classes and not grad students (no grad program at butler) I did as little academic wise as I could because classes only recorded on my home university as pass/fail with GPA not affected. Classes will be homework heavy which was a change for me and you won't have lectures in a big lecture hall with class tutorials only (small school). Attendance to class is pretty much compulsory, with a few exceptions. Generally as an international student my professors didn't expect too much from me and were ok with some late assignments and missed classes, but I guess your profs will be different",

If you're over 21 there are lots and lots of great local bars in broad ripple and around Indy, and tons of great local restaurants to explore. There's a zoo, a couple malls, museums, and more attractions. I second the other guy's advice to live in AV over Resco. Apartment village is much nicer, you get a kitchen to make your own food (their dining service is okay, not great) and more space. If you have any questions, feel free to pm me!",

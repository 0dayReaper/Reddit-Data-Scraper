    "postText": "Hello Butler Redditors,\n\nI will be attending Butler starting in the Fall and I have a few questions and concerns that could hopefully be cleared up by you.\n\nI feel very uneasy about living in a dorm. I tend to like my privacy and HATE sharing my personal space, especially with so many people. My fear is to the point that I would almost rather be a commuter student. How would you say the dorm life is at Butler? \n\nI signed up for my major to be in Finance, but might change it to E&amp;I (I plan to attend law school after), and I'm not sure which would be better suited for me. \n\nHow are the professors at the COB?\n\nAny other tips about classes or the University in general would also be helpful, thanks.",

            "comment": "Communicate Communicate Communicate! Your dorm experience will be what you make of it, so as long as you talk to your roommate about your personal space, you should be fine. Just have an open mind. Personally, I loved dorm life at Butler - minus the lack of air conditioning. Shared bathrooms take getting used to, but honestly they are not as intimidating or nasty as some stories would have you believe.\n\nNow, as a COB graduate, I can help a little more. I would say if your ultimate goal is law school, E&amp;amp;I probably wouldn't be a good track, but if you double major finance with E&amp;amp;I, that's a really good combo. I was actually a double major in finance and E&amp;amp;I for a while, but dropped it for other reasons. E&amp;amp;I is actually designed to be a good double major. As for pre-law, your best friend is going to be Professor James McKneight, he's in charge of pre-law stuff for COB. He is one of the best professors at Butler - funny, knowledgeable, and just an all around good guy. \n\nAll of the professors in the COB are awesome. I rarely had a class I didn't enjoy, and even then it was probably because I wasn't interested in the course material, not because of the professor. They are all super helpful, willing to meet outside of class, and they all want you to succeed. Looking back on my four years, I wish I had taken advantage of my professors more. GO TO OFFICE HOURS! I rarely did this and sorely regret it. Your professors are your best resource for everything during your time at Butler - academics, professionally, and even personally. Make those connections, even outside of the COB - my favorite professor and now one of my good friends is a professor I had freshman year from the English department.\n\nGeneral University Tips:\n\n* Get involved. Over commit yourself to clubs and activities at first to find the ones you want to stay with.\n\n* Join Dawg Pound if you're into sports. This is a total homer tip from me because I ran Dawg Pound this past year. I never thought I would be in charge when I was a freshman, but look at me now...\n\n* Make friends, and be open to change. It's super easy to make friends in the dorms. I know you said you're uneasy about the personal space thing, but honestly the best way to meet people is to just walk in their room and say Hey. \n\n* Breathe. It can and will be a little overwhelming. Take a break from all the hubub if you need to.\n\nIf you have any more specific questions, don't hesitate to ask them. I love answering questions about Butler!",

            "comment": "I was fine with dorm life at Butler, lived in Ross freshman year and just wrapped up a year at ResCo. If you really need personal space then Ross is probably not your best option with public restrooms and showers.\n\nI would say that dorm life is very dependent on the people in your unit, freshman year I spent a lot of time with people in my unit and 4 of us roomed together in a suite in ResCo. I think that the roommate surveys they ask you to do (noise preferences, messy or clean, etc.) do a pretty good job at matching you up with someone you would get along with, I'm going to live with my freshman year roommate next year in Butler Terrace.\n\nSo I guess in summary, I had a really good time with dorm life in my first two years. I am generally a quiet person until I get to know people so I kind of understand where you're coming from, but commuting wasn't an option for me. I would say give it a year and see how you feel about it and if you really don't like it commute for the rest of your time at Butler.\n\nAs for COB things I can't really answer, I'm a Music Ed guy.",

            "comment": "Per Dorms:\n\nIt will be tough, but learning to share space and co-exist with non family is probably one of the most important life lessons that you need to learn in college. Its also a good way to learn to live on your own with training wheels as you don't have to take care of everything.\n\nDifferent Dorms have different experiences, and most likely if you live on campus you will stay in a few of them.",

            "comment": "I completely understand feeling uneasy about living in dorms. I was too. I am really introverted and really need that alone time. I actually got a lot of time on my own because my roommate was really involved in a lot of things. The key, like others have mentioned, is to communicate. Maybe try to swap schedules with your roommate so you each know when you can get some time on your own. It might even help to agree upon specific times (maybe an hour or so a week) for each other to get alone time in your room.\n\nThe key will be compromise and communication. ",

            "comment": "Honestly the dorm experience has potential to be uncomfortable beginning to end. But it's also a hugely essential step in my opinion to independence. Living at home will do you no favors in establishing your own independence and it's also way harder to make friends when you don't live on campus. I'd say at least give it a chance. You're lucky that you have the option of it really truly blows to move back home at the semester. \n\nAs to major - don't stress too much. Take some classes. Learn some things. Don't be afraid to change majors or take different classes. Who you are now and your goals today will almost definitely be different than who and what they are in 4 (or 5 or 6...) years when you graduate. ",

            "comment": "You could always ask to live in a single if having a roommate freaks you out. I personally did not get along with my roommates freshman year, but it didn't matter. I hardly saw them and just through some headphones on if I needed to ignore them. There's also a facebook page for your class, you could try reaching out to some people, maybe find some like minded people. ",

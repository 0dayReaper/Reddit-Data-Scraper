            "comment": "It's insane to me that these things still aren't handled directly by the police. I don't understand *why* BUPD needs to wait for university lawyers tell them what to do. I don't understand why the University needs to be involved anyway, and yet here we are asking them to do more.\n\nWhen police are restricted from doing their duty and the university is obviously incapable of performing the task, then it shouldn't be the university's obligation. \n\nThat being said, i sympathize with this student and her parents who believe that the university took a laissez-faire attitude, but it seems to me that many victims (this student included) simply wanted the memory to disappear. At the very least, this has been the case for peers that I knew. Imo, it should be up to the victim to decide how to overcome their trauma",

                    "comment": "The university needs to be involved because rape is a violation of Title IX. It is considered to be a form of gender discrimination, as in the victim has been targeted and harmed because of their gender/sexuality, and the university is responsible for the enforcement of Title IX.\n\nPlus, even if the sexual assault case is being handled by police, that takes time. And in that time, the victim is in close proximity to her attacker and is vulnerable to retaliation and intimidation from the attacker and their friends/frat brothers/etc. The university needs to step up and remove rapists from campus. Especially in cases like this, where the accused student had been reported multiple times for sexual offenses and yet absolutely no action had been taken to protect the women on campus from him.",

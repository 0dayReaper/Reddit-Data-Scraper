However, having been born and raised in Philly, the Palestra will always be my favorite. Nonetheless, it was a win-win matchup, so go Hinkle!\n\nFor anyone here who likes Hinkle and college basketball in general (which I'm assuming is everyone), I highly recommend going to Philly sometime and catching a game at the Palestra, preferably a Big 5 game if you can.

    "postText": "I graduated in 2005. I moved out of state and haven\u2019t been back on campus since 2009 or so. I brought my wife and two kids to Homecoming this weekend and holy shit has campus changed. So many new buildings! And so beautiful. Butler looked great in 2005 but the improvements to campus are really nice.  \n\nIt was also amazing walking through Lilly Hall with my 3 year old son, seeing all the familiar names on the doors. Brought back so many memories of staying in that building practically overnight practicing and hanging out with friends.   \n\nI hope it\u2019s not another 8 or so years before I\u2019m back. Miss you Butler!",

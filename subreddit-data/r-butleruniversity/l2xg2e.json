    "postText": "Hi, I'm a student from Purdue WL, in Indy for an internship this fall. I've been looking for student friendly housing for a while, and figured this might be a good place to ask for advice on the same. Basically looking for a 1bed/studio that offers short term leases and is preferably furnished. Location isn't of much concern as long its not more than a 40 minute's drive to Fishers, and is safe. My budget is between $750 to $950 per month. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "If by any chance you\u2019d be interested in housesharing, you could go way under your budget and sublet from someone\u2019s senior house. Generally speaking 50% of senior houses will have at least one bedroom open during the summer from someone working somewhere else who wants a subletter - most rent per person falls between $500-$650 plus utilities. The houses generally have 4-6 bedrooms, some more, some fewer, with laundry, living rooms, full kitchens, parking, etc. Easiest way would be to request to join the Butler Class of 21 and Class of 22 Facebook pages - subletting posts start breaking out like rashes in the spring! Just for a thought! Good luck in your search!",

I did find one apartment on Zillow in downtown Indy that's a good size for $950 and is only 29 minutes from Fishers.  It's also right in the heart of downtown in a safe area:\n\nhttps://www.zillow.com/b/blacherne-at-vermont-place-indianapolis-in-5Zbnxw/",

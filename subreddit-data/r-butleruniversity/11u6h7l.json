            "comment": "I only have experience with ResCo, not Irvington. Irvington is usually considered the \u201cnicer\u201d one of the two, although ResCo did just receive renovations and I have no experience with the building post-renovation.\n\nDorms should be big enough for a TV and an XBox. My roommate had her gaming setup, and there was definitely enough space. You may have to move some furniture to play at an ideal angle, but there\u2019s definitely room.\n\nYeah, I had a bad experience with my freshman year roommate, and I know a few other people who did, too, but I think that\u2019s largely the outlier experience. Most people, at the very least, end up tolerating their roommates. Our suitemates were total angels, and my roommates after my freshman year one have all been great. \n\nPeople are usually pretty courteous; quiet hours and the like are usually respected. The only thing I guess you could count as non-courteous is that the ceilings/floor are pretty thin, so you will ALWAYS hear stomping above you. There\u2019s not a lot you can do about that, unfortunately, but you do get used to it pretty quickly.",

There\u2019s definitely space, and if there is a bad roommate it\u2019s a pretty rare case and residence life is really good about handling issues between roommates in my experience. I lived in the renovated portion of ResCo last year and if the rest of the building matches that now, then it\u2019s pretty nice (as nice as a freshman dorm can be, personal bathrooms and a dining hall in the building!). I enjoyed my time there. \n\nWith that being said, if you have the opportunity to commute, I would. Unless you have some phenomenal scholarships and are really looking for the \u201ccollege experience\u201d then it could be beneficial, but housing prices are pretty expensive and the cost of tuition, housing, and meal plans continues to go up every year.",

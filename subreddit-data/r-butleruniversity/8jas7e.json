    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nBasically, I was just wondering if there are other older students on campus. This is probably just a silly fear, but I'm scared of standing out in class/cafeteria/at games. Right now I'm sitting at a 4.0, and I'm 26 years old looking to transfer when I'm 28. I was just wondering if it's going to be a little weird transferring to Butler, or if I should just go to IUPUI. \nThanks!",

It seemed like everyone liked him a lot, and everyone liked to ask him questions because he had a different perspective than us youngins. So while you may stand out, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll necessarily be a bad thing, it might even work in your favor. ",

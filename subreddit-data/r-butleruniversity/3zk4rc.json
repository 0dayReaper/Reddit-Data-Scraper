I've got a house near 54th and primrose, spitting distance from 20 tap, yats, moe and johnnys, etc. Have a couple possible extra rooms to rent out for $300 or $400 a month, depending on the room. All utilities included. Currently here are me, a 30yo guy, my brother, a dog and 2 cats. All common spaces are fair game. Just looking that common space is shared respectably. Shoot me a pm if you know anyone who might be interested! Thanks!",

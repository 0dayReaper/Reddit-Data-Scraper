I will be commuting to Lawrence for work part-time and studying part-time for an online post-bachelors degree in Computer Science.\n\nI'm 24M and am looking for apartments in the near area. If anyone is familiar with the area and can let me know where a quiet apartment/housing is around the northeast part of Indianapolis. If interested please PM me and I can provide more details. Thanks,",

Purdue definitely has a better program though - it's just a matter of how motivated you are/what you're looking for. Someone else got downvoted for saying it but a lot more people know the Purdue name. Butler's only really got a good reputation in Indiana/Indianapolis",

I remember having them say \"maybe you guys can use an IDE or something, idk\" exactly once. Otherwise you're just expected to use a text editor like notepad++\n\n90% plus of what you write will be Java or C++, with some variation if you take a specific elective like iOS app development.\n\nThere's other stuff too, but TL;DR it didn't always feel super current.\n\nThe caveat though is to remember though is that a CS degree is more about the theory anyways, so some of this doesn't REALLY matter. It's about understanding the concepts more than the coding itself. Just my opinion",

Ask people who you might want to be friends with if they know any cool places to study, and then go there and study but don\u2019t bother them until the 3rd time you see them there.  \n\nShit like that.",

Intramurals were fun, and I worked some as a referee that allowed me to make money and be on campus with others. I tried to take every opportunity to be on campus the first year or so, then it just kind of all came together.",

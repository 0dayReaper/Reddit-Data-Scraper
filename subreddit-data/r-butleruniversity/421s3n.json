    "postText": "The IU Alcohol Research Center seeks moderate to heavy alcohol drinkers aged 21-40. After an interview, qualified participants visit our lab for two one-day sessions. The study measures whether aversive stimuli affect drinking behavior, and takes place at IU Health Hospital, 550 University Blvd in Indianapolis. You can earn $275 for completing the interview and sessions. For information, please call us at 317-278-6761 and refer to the ICE study. Martin Plawecki, MD, Ph.D., principal investigator.",

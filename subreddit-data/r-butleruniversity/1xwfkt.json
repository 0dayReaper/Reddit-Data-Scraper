    "postText": "Players hustled so hard last night against Creighton until the last 30 seconds. What play was B. Miller going for with that? What was the point of even calling that timeout if they were going to look confused on who was going to take that shot?\n\nI've heard rumors that there is a lack of respect for the coach from players. Does anyone have any insight on why Castro is still benched?",

More than likely going to transfer after this year.\n\nIf we play like we did last night, I think we can definitely beat Providence next week. This was by no means a bad loss, and it was a winnable game. They played their asses off and that's all I've been asking for. Yeah we lost but it didn't hurt like the last few.",

            "comment": "I haven't heard anything about the lack of respect from the players. With what he was put into, Miller has done a great job. Imagine how hard it is coming into that job and who you had to replace. He's done great. Sure, he could have done a better job with game management in some situations (the Georgetown game comes to mind) and not sure what the play was last night. But you have to commend him for making the most of what he's got. Most of the games have been very competitive. \n\nThe only thing I would maybe like to see more of is some of the younger players getting some playing time. Chrabascz and Brown have been getting a lot of minutes, but I would like to see some of the other players. At this point in the season, you have to be looking to next year. College basketball is too competitive to try to make a late season run with a record of 2-11. Give the younger players some experience of playing in a D1 game, because most of them haven't yet. Now I'm not sure who will start next year with what seems like some great recruits in Martin and Wideman coming in, but at least give Berry, Morgan, etc. a chance to play.",

Is that even a reasonable question to ask?\n\nI do agree though about the young players. They need to get ready for next year, and let the rest of this year be what it is. I think the team still has the potential it needs, just needs to get firing TOGETHER and on all cylinders, not the mismatch that seems to be happening.",

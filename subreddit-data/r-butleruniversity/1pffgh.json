Could you all do me a favor by taking a survey for a psychology class?\n\nI am a senior at Marian University, and I plan on attending the research conference in the spring. Thus, my research would be better if I increased my sample size and got participants from other universities. \n \n[Survey Link](http://www.yourinputmatters.com/se.ashx?s=6E986B821E97C700) \n \nbtw, good luck tomorrow with Nova Southeastern.",

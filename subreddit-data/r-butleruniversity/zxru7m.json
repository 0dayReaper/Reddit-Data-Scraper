    "postText": "Hi, I'm looking for an apartment/house to stay in from May to August of 2023. Thought it would be a good idea to ask here since I have accepted an internship in Indianapolis and people might be going back to their hometowns during the summer. My name is John, I'm a straight male, like watching sports, chilling, watching movies, and going on random drives in my free time. I'm bringing my car up too so a parking place would be a plus. I would prefer to have one or two roommates during my stay here. I'm looking for somewhere in the 600-800$ range monthly. Feel free to comment here or dm me if you are interested in the idea, thanks! Looking forward to getting to know y'all.",

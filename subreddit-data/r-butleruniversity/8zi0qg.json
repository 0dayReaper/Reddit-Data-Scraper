    "postText": "Sorry to bother all of you but I'm  probbally going to applying to this school soon and was hoping I could ask some questions to a few people who go or have gone there.  If you have time, and have an opinion, please feel free to answer one, some or all of these questions, it'd be a huge help for me.\n\n1:  Is Greek life as important to this school as a lot of people say? I've read that Greek life at this place is pretty important to the school, and that you can miss out on a lot by not doing it. While I'm more then open to trying out Greek life, I will admit that I don't exactly look the part and don't think I'd be able to get a bid, though I'd sure as hell try.  Is it worth the risk, and if i don't get in to a frat how much would i be missing in terms of social experience?\n\n2:  Over all how would you guys say the dorms are?  I've found veeerry mixed results online.\n\n3:  Are the professors as good as people say? I've been reading about how nice they are over on niche but it seems almost to good to be true.\n\n4: How active are the clubs around here and are there alot? I'd love to get meet new people in different communities.  Outside of clubs and greek life are there any other types of activities on campus?\n\n5: Lastly, for someone  who like  is slightly on the nerdy side but also  pretty physically active and extroverted, do you think I'd be able to fit in here? The sports games alone make this place interesting for me. \n\nThank you very much for answering if anyone actually does!",

If you're a chick, you tend to get a little leeway, but you'll likely be limited to socializing with the two options above. \n\nGreek life at Butler really does tend to be for most people though, so i wouldn't try to compare yourself with whatever \"frat dude\" stereotype you're probably imagining. As long as your social and you're not creepy you'll probably find a spot somewhere. I wouldn't worry about being too nerdy, tons of nerdy kids on campus.\n\nThere's definitely a lot of clubs, but again you'll find a lot of them are led/filled with members of Greek life. High chance these members will treat their clubs second to being a member of Greek life. If you like sports then you'll definitely like it at Butler, especially if you play basketball. Kids are always playing.\n\nIf you're able too, I would suggest taking a True Blue visit. You essentially shadow a kid in your major and you'll check out the gym/cafeteria/classes/campus/dorms/etc. They'll have the answers to any questions you might have about campus/campus life\n",

            "comment": "Greek life is a prominent part of the social atmosphere on campus. Girls can get away with not being in one cause it\u2019s still easy for us to get into parties etc but I think it\u2019s a little harder for guys. Rush doesn\u2019t start until after Christmas break so you have the ability to make normal friends but after rush you tend to lose a lot of them. That being said, since you\u2019re on the geeky side (if you\u2019re a guy) and you want to rush, i recommend Phi Delt? In my experience they\u2019re sporty and nerdy and just overall a good mix of guys. \n\nI think the dorms are okay here, granted I lived in CTS my freshman year but when I hung out with people I didn\u2019t think it was bad. ResCo is pretty new and has a dining hall and a bunch of hangout areas. Jordan is super old and doesn\u2019t have AC but it seems like it\u2019s really easy to build a lot of friendships on your floor. There\u2019s a new dorm called Irvington that they just completed but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s for freshmen or not. \n\nProfessors here are super nice! The roomies are true! They\u2019re willing to help you as long as you\u2019re willing to help yourself. Granted they\u2019re still people so they\u2019ll have some flaws but overall they\u2019re a solid 8/10 in my book. \n\nThere are a lot of clubs but I was personally bad about joining them freshmen year and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to join since but SGA holds a lot of events and there\u2019s always stuff going on campus. \n\nAnd as far as being nerdy and athletic, you can totally be both. Everyone here is pretty welcoming, so I think you\u2019ll do fine. \n",

            "comment": "I\u2019ll speak to some of this - first, the dorms.  The \u201cmixed results\u201d you\u2019ve found probably are comparing ResCo to Ross Hall.  The latter will not be used in the fall - the two freshman dorms are ResCo and Irvington, both of which are air-conditioned and both of which (I think) use the \u201csuite-style,\u201d \u201cjack-and-jill,\u201d one bathroom for four people residence layout (whatever you want to call it).\n\nAs an independent student (non-Greek), I can say that you shouldn\u2019t feel like that\u2019s a must-have for a Butler student.  They say online that about 30-38% go Greek.  The friends I\u2019ve made have come from music ensembles I\u2019ve played in, tight-knit classes I\u2019ve taken, or the clubs I\u2019ve tried - no shortage of problems there.  And despite our basketball record, most of us are \u201cnerdy\u201d in some way or another - BU\u2019s a good school first and foremost.\n\nI\u2019ll echo comments about the professors - I\u2019ve had 12 or so in my first year and haven\u2019t yet had one I didn\u2019t like (or who didn\u2019t know my name by the end of the semester).",

            "comment": "1.) The saying they always use during campus tours is that Greek life is \"prominent, not dominant\" but you will definitely have a more rich college experience if you go Greek. That said, the fraternities here aren't your typical frats, and if you are fairly extroverted and not a complete fuckup I'm confident you'd find a place to fit in. I wouldn't be worried about not getting a bid. Even if rush week doesn't go well and you don't get one, several houses do \"open rush\" immediately afterward which gives you another chance to find a place that works better for you.\n\n2.) It really depends where you end up living. There are a bunch of new dorms being built that are super fancy and they are in the process of phasing out the old dorms. I believe as a freshman you'd be living in either resco or Ross. Resco is decent enough, although some people say it can feel like a prison due to the floor layout. It's suite style though, so you'd have your own bedroom. Ross is definitely a shithole, but it's definitely part of the classic college experience. It's a very social place to live and you will meet tons of cool people living there; some of my favorite college memories were had in Ross. After freshman year the housing does get a lot better though. Many sophomores either move into their fraternity house or live in Fairview which is a new dorm they built a year or two ago and is super fancy.\n\n3.) Proofs are very good here, and you definitely will get some one on one time with them due to the small class size. Your results will vary with your major, but this definitely is one of the strengths of Butler. \n\n4.) There definitely are a lot of clubs. Club and intramural sports are pretty active, there's an active strategy game club, and I know there are some E-Sports teams if you're into that. There are a TON of other activities going on your freshman year, namely all of the welcome week stuff they do during new student orientation. if you're extroverted you'll absolutely have no problem meeting people on campus. Greek life probably is the number one way though, it seems like there's stuff going on nonstop.\n\n5.) Absolutely. The community of care thing is definitely real, and I'm sure you'll find somewhere to fit in. \n\nSource: graduated in May\n\nFeel free to pm me if you've got any other questions.",

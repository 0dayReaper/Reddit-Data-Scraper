To be honest though butler costs alot of money and knowing what i know now,  id say save your money.  Purdue is solid and cheap and is more technology/engineering related and will save you money.  I might get flack from this but in the real world and seeing dozens of CVs interviewing or on interviews with prospective people i could care less what school you came from",

I like the advice of state schools for this vocation. I would also highly recommend IU\u2019s school of Informatics. I have had great luck recruiting from that program. Good luck, OP!",

The biggest difference you'll see from Butler vs Pudue is the class sizes. At Butler, they'll be at most 30 people in a class and the professors are very accessible and actually look at your code. At Purdue, you're one of hundreds and you'll be graded solely on how your code passed automated tests. \n\nMy recommendation is to apply if you are interested and see what kind of financial aid you get. I'd have a hard time recommending you go at full tuition, even though I absolutely loved my time at Butler. But if you can get scholarships and aid to have it be comparable to state school tuition then absolutely do it. I was fortunate enough to get scholarships to cover half of my tuition which allowed me to go.",

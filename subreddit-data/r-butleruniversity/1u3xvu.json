    "postText": "Well today marks the beginning of an era....the first Big East game for the Bulldogs. It's going to be a hard welcoming game against a *tough* Villanova team. I watched them the other night against 'Cuse and they can play.\n\nUnfortunately, I won't be able to go to the game because I'm at home in Philly for winter break. I will be watching it on TV and cheering on the Bulldogs (despite being surrounded by lots of Nova fans). \n\nI'm really looking forward to this game. What are your thoughts on the game?",

I'm just really glad they fought back each time they got down; especially after the beginning of the second half and the beginning of OT. \n\nTwo last things about the game:\n\n1) Hopefully, Woods isn't hurt too bad. He took a knee to the thigh when he was driving down the lane and was stretching it a lot on the sideline and during breaks. He should be fine.\n2) Someone needs to get a gif of Marshall jumping over the crowd and back onto the court. Fucking hilarious and total bossmode. That is all.\n\nAlright, happy new year and lets kick Xavier's ass on Saturday.",

I think no matter who comes out on top it will be a hard fought victory; there's not going to be any more blowouts in Hinkle the rest of the season in my opinion. Every Big East team can play ball, even if their record says otherwise. Also, shameless plug for /r/BigEast!",

I love to play baseball and some of my favorite shows include How I Met Your Mother, Big Bang Theory, Impractical Jokers, and a bunch of anime shows. I also love all different types of videogames ranging from Mario to cod. Message me if you are looking for a roommate too and want to know more about me. ",

    "postText": "Hey folks,\n\nI randomly decided to see if Butler had an official color scheme/code and found out we do. Unfortunately, I've been using the wrong color for the past 4 months on our header. Also, my photo manipulation skills are basically non-existant (I made our logo with the Ragemaker for god's sake) so the logo's background is the same color as the header. \n\nIf I changed the color code for the header, it would [look like this.](http://i.imgur.com/quDe30G.png)\n\nSoooo,\n\nIf someone wants to fix our current logo to match the new color (Hex #00449E), I'd be forever grateful.\n\nI lost the original logo I made which was really large, so [here's the small version](http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/MfHUPp7kzlQmCgXm.jpg)\n\nFeel free to make suggestions on ways we can improve the subreddit!\n",

I know that I cut it out from something that had BUTLER in those big block letters.\n\nGo nuts if you think you can make a better logo\n\nPersonally I'm not a huge fan of the torch but Blue 2 and Trip would be awesome. Maybe replacing Snoo's head with one of them would be cool.",

Also if there is a way to not have the white background and just have it mesh with the color of the header that would be great. I think what I did was just paint the white background the same color as the header. That way Snoo will stand out from the header.\n\nI'm pretty sure [this](http://www.sportsflagsandpennants.com/images_products/butler_bulldogs_house_flag_64312sma.jpg) is the 'B' I used for the old Snoo. The new one looks a bit Times New Roman-y.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what else you come up with!",

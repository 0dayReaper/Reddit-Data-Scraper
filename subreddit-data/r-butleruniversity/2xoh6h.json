    "postText": "Hello All\n\nI am the new Community manager for Dota 2 at Ebash, a gaming center in Indianapolis and Terre Haute, IN. I will be hosting weekly Dota nights as well as monthly events such as viewing parties or LAN parties. We will be also doing beginner nights for those that want to try the game or those who want some help improving. Its a fun and friendly environment that also provides players that aren't TI material a place to test their skills.\n\nEbash was made for gamers so they have up-to-date equipment and have access to almost all popular competitive games. So if you want to dabble in other games, that's ok! You can also bring your own set up if you really want to, the company is privately owned and very flexible with accommodating to gamer needs.\n\nIf anyone is interested, message me either on here or thru steam. It will be hosted every Tuesday from 6 p.m. till close with special events on weekends each month. The month of March will be free on Tuesday for those playing Dota and first time guests will also be free. \n\nPlease join the Facebook group below to receive event notifications and to not miss out on the fun or follow me on twitter. My steam name is Fluffyleopard and the picture is me, I'm a girl.\n\nMy steam id: http://steamcommunity.com/id/fluffyleopard\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/ebashDOTA/\n\n@eBashDota",

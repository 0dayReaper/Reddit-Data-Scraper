    "postText": "I\u2019m a high school senior who\u2019s probably going to attend butler next year and I\u2019m torn about what to major in if my ultimate goal is going to dental school. On one hand, music was pretty much all I did outside of class in high school and I was and am heavily involved in pretty much everything relating to music performance; I\u2019m at a small, private high school. Needless to say, I would love to major in music. However, from what I\u2019ve heard, majoring in music is a different beast than say, English or history.\nWould majoring in music (BA)\nwhile doing predent be too difficult based on what you know of the two programs at butler? I\u2019m trying to decide between doing history + predent or music + predent, and while I would be happy doing either, I definitely would want to do music if it\u2019s not too difficult to manage in your opinion as students here. Thanks.",

            "comment": "So I don't really know anything about the pre-dental program, but I was a double major for a while with a BA in Music. I started as a Bachelor of Music student trying to double major which...not recommended. Doing a music major is a significant time investment, I won't lie to you. You'll have ensemble rehearsals (which are a couple of hours each, multiple times a week), lessons, and studio classes, all of which require their own practice time. As well as theory, aural skills, music history, yadayadayada. I wasn't able to do it because I was basically the least disciplined musician of all time. I barely practiced, while others in my year and instrument (percussion) would literally sleep under marimbas in the practices rooms cause they were practicing at 2am and needed to get a few hours sleep before their 8am theory class. Those are just the two extremes, though. \n\nI wouldn't trade it though. It was a blast, and in between all my other classes in other programs that would stress me out, I could always return to music to relax and to find my happy place, essentially. I eventually finished out my time at Butler with just a music minor (for a number of reasons), but even with a minor you can be in ensembles (if I remember right). My best advice to you would be to work with advisors in pre-dent and JCA to find the best path forward for you. I graduated 5 years ago so I can't speak for exactly how they are now, but everyone I ever worked with at JCA was unbelievably kind and helpful if you just talk to them. They can't help if they don't know what you're struggling with. A potential idea for managing class loads could be maybe doing some of your pre-dent or core classes during the summer (if you're willing to take summer classes, of course), which would free up your time during the semester to ensure you have enough time for all of your classwork and music work and to have a life outside of that. \n\nI hope that helps some. I was in exactly your position when I was in high school, and I'm absolutely certain a large number of musicians around the world have been and continue to be for the rest of time lol. It's something we all deal with, so you're definitely not alone in this struggle. Not to mention, you can always change if it becomes too hard or you no longer enjoy it. Hell, I must've changed my majors and minors around 4 or 5 times during undergrad. It's ok to change your mind, you're still a damn teenager!\n\nTL;DR Doing a dual major will always be difficult, especially because music just takes time, but you certainly know that by now. But the important thing is to do things you love. I found in my time at Butler that you can still participate musically, even if that's not your primary focus any longer. Don't stress about needing to make up your mind for the rest of your life or even just the next four years when you're only 18.\n\nEdit just to add: And good luck to you in whatever you choose to do. Butler is a great place to be for all of those programs you're interested in, so I'm certain you will find your way no problem.",

Ive heard a lot of people say that practicing is the main aspect of majoring in music that makes it challenging, but I think I'm up to give it a try. I haven't been leaving the house much lately due to the pandemic so pretty much all I've been doing outside of online school is practicing the drums anyway lol. But I'll definitely take your advice about talking with the advisors.",

He'll push you, but it will be the most fun you'll have in any ensemble ever. But percussion is definitely a lot of work because percussion ensemble doesn't (or at least didn't) count for your \"major ensemble.\" So you'll be in percussion ensemble and something like wind ensemble as well as your lessons and studio classes. It's hard but I know from experience that this particular percussion program is worth it to be a part of. JC will also be a great resource for you to help space things out and everything you'll need to complete it all from the music side at least. \n\nI'm actually almost jealous of you getting to experience the percussion program for the first time lol. It was a great experience.",

            "comment": "To add on - I'm a pharmacy student, but spent my first couple years at Butler in music ensembles and taking lessons without being a music major - or even a music minor!  They also have an [Ensemble Participation Scholarship](https://www.butler.edu/music/non-major-participation) for non-majors as well, where you take lessons and play in an ensemble for $1000/semester scholarship (auditions are in January).  I would also highly recommend the athletic bands (marching band in the fall, basketball band in the winter), which are also open to any student on campus.  I dropped my individual lessons after two semesters, though, and ensemble participation (not basketball band) after three - it definitely is a lot to try to manage with the pharmacy curriculum, and I assume pre-dental as well.",

Know your limits, your first five or six semesters will probably be around 20 credits (at least for  EDDP). It's definitely challenging but there is a great music community, especially when it communites to professional fraternities. If you think you can do it, go for it! And there's no shame in changing your major(s) if you realize it's not for you. :)",

    "postText": "Hello, I checked Butler University's website and it says that the average GPA accepted is from 3.59-4.14 and SAT from 1160-1310. My high school GPA is currently 3.67 and SAT 1170, and planning on taking the SAT again. I am involved in sports and many extracurriculars at my school (i.e. football, lacrosse, robotics, key club, student council). Would I have a good chance of being accepted, and if 'yes' would applying Early Action be beneficial? Or wait to apply for Regular Decision after I raise my GPA this fall? Thank you for your comments! ",

            "comment": "You'll probably be fine. Your numbers fall in the average ranges, and the nature of an average means there are plenty of people who fall both above and below them that get accepted.\n\nIf it makes you feel better, then wait and try to improve those numbers. You probably don't need to. And early action can only be beneficial, it's not a commitment like early decision is. Good luck!",

From this point forward I\u2019d just express a lot of interest in the school. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done a visit, but if you haven\u2019t that will improve your chances a lot. Also colleges will usually send representatives to your high school so be on the look out for that too. Best of luck, go Dawgs!",

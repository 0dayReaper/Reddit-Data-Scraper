            "comment": "Currently going through the program as a BME. It's a hard and rigorous program, but almost all engineering programs will be. I'll warn you that with those two majors your class load is gonna be huge. You'll have multiple semesters of 19+ credits just to get through all the classes you need for both majors since there's gonna be no overlap between them. To top it off, BME is one of the hardest engineering programs we have. My advice would be to decide what it is you want to do with those two degrees, and figure out exactly what it takes to get there to make sure it's what you want. \nOverall the program is good. The people in it are really nice and you get close with a lot of people in engineering pretty quickly. I have no regrets about my choice to be in it!",

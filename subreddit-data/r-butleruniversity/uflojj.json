            "comment": "I graduated from the engineering program, so I took a handful of physics courses. Physics is a very small program. The professors are all incredibly intelligent and you will be able to interact with them often outside of class. Take advantage of that! Make a point to meet upperclassmen in the program. They will help immensely, particularly when it comes to getting pointers of what to study for tests and finals. It's generally assumed you already know calculus coming in, so be prepared to hit the ground running. Don't let PH201 scare you away, YOU WILL LIKELY FAIL YOUR FIRST TESTS. Remember that most professors grade on a curve and it will get better.\n\nGood luck and welcome to the Butler community!",

I am currently taking PH201 and didn\u2019t fail the first two tests surprisingly - I actually just recieved an 85% on my end term exam, and was quite happy about it since it was pretty difficult. Thanks for your comment on this post again haha I am enjoying my first year so far!",

It is meant to be something of a weed out class for half-hearted engineering majors. \ud83d\ude42\n\nDo the work. Go to class. Pay attention. Go to the weekly homework/study sessions with the TA. The upperclass physics students that usually run it are helpful and sympathetic. And studying with your classmates helps out a lot. Studying does not have to be a solo activity.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask any of the profs for help on assignments/studying during office hours.\n\nIf they see you putting in the effort (especially Kosik) they will grade you fairly and give you the extra help you need.\n\nGood luck!",

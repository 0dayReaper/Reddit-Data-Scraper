A bit closer is BT, which is a little closer, but you might get a roommate. There's fairview, which is on campus and really nice, but expensive, and mostly sophomores. CTS and UT aren't the greatest options imo, but many people seem to enjoy them. They're not the worst, just fairly isolated. Feel free to DM me if you have any other questions ",

When I lived at AV from fall 2013-spring 2015 I knew a handful of computer science students who lived in AV. They'd get together often outside of class (many students, at the time, stayed in Fairbanks to hang with fellow CS students and do work) to drink and hang out.\n\nGood luck!",

I just hung out a lot with some of the folks in that department and studied in this one room because the department and it's people were a lot cooler and chill than those in my major. \n\nSome of the CS students I knew did have internships though. Not my ex boyfriend, but he seems to be a exception to the success that I've seen the CS alumni have (according to their Facebooks and LinkedIns).\nA company called Orchard -located I think in Carmel, IN (nice city north of Indy) has hired many CS majors out of school.\n\nThis may not be the case any more, but once a month the CS department would have a pizza lunch and a CS alum or a company person would come in and talk to the students about what they're doing. I didn't always attended those (since I wasn't in CS) but it was a good way to see the success of alumni in the program. ",

    "postText": "So, the person I hired to help me with my final paper (a 30+ master's thesis) has run in to family problems and cannot help me. My paper is due Friday and I need help with organization, minor edits/grammar check, and citing. I can pay per $20/hour and need help today(!) through Friday, if possible. I'm thinking 10-15 hours max. I need someone who is 'honestly' confident in their writing skills. Please PM me if you/re: a) have the time b) are interested c) are responsible. Thanks!!",

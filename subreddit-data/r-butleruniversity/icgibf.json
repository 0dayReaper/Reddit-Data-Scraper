I wanna spend time with these guys and watch the games with them but I simply can\u2019t contribute to any conversation cause I\u2019ve never watched a lot of basketball. Is there anywhere I can go to learn quickly?",

            "comment": "Basketball is, like most sports, deceptively complex but still built on a simple foundation: the team that scores the most points wins. How teams accomplish this can vary wildly based on the strengths and weaknesses of their own team and how that matches up with that day's opponent.\n\nAre you a gamer? Video games are a good way to learn the rules and fundamentals of a sport that is unfamiliar.\n\nA quick search on youtube for [\"learn how to watch basketball\"](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=learn+how+to+watch+basketball+) has several short but promising results that might help get you up to speed. Be aware that college/NCAA rules are different than the NBA which is different from Olympic basketball, etc.\n\nLastly, feel free to post a response or PM me. Happy to help answer anything I can.",

            "comment": "Honestly, just watch the games with them and listen to the conversations. My roommate understood basketball and knew a bit about it before last year, but he always said that he learned a lot from just being in the room while I was watching games. Even my neighbor freshman year ended up knowing who James Harden was by the end of the year and she couldn\u2019t have cared less lol. Granted I\u2019m a bit to fanatical for sure. \n\nTwitter is also a great way to learn basic things about players through people either being informative or making fun of the players. During commercial breaks, I\u2019m always on twitter. It is a good way to pass time and people on twitter are funny.",

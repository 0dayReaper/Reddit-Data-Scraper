    "postText": "Hi, I am considering Butler for next year but live in Massachusetts and haven't had a chance to visit yet.  I really like the school from looking at it online.  Wondering if I'll fit in., pretty much no one from my school has gone there.  Are students friendly?  What is social scene like?  Do most students go on to grad school after (I'd like to go to law school)? Thanks!",

            "comment": "Hi! I graduated in May with a degree in psych and sociology. I think people are pretty friendly at Butler. The social scene is kinda what you make it. If you\u2019re interested in large parties and planned events then go Greek. There\u2019s also lots of events on campus and clubs you can join. A ton of people from my majors go on to grad school, probably more than 50% have plans to go to grad school, though I can\u2019t speak for other majors. My close friend is from Connecticut and she really enjoyed butler. ",

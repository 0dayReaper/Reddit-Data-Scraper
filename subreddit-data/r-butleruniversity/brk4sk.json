    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm moving to Indianapolis soon to go to a small technical school near Butler University, and I'm looking for a roommate so I thought I'd post here...mods let me know if I should take this down.\n\nI'm 21F and graduated with a bachelor's degree from a different university last year. I'm pretty quiet (NOT into partying!!) and will be working from home when I'm not at school. Anyone interested in living off campus up towards Noblesville, please PM me.\n\nThanks!",

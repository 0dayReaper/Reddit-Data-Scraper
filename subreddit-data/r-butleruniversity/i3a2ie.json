Also, I don\u2019t understand the complaints behind \u201cwe don\u2019t know our plan.\u201d I\u2019ve gotten some pretty comprehensive emails regarding operations, sanitization, and quarantine procedures. It might sound a little vague on paper, but a large part of it all is putting into practice.",

They would have a huge financial gain from that. Also I'm sorry but there is no way in hell that students aren't going to go party or go and make friends. In my shared house we all got sick because one guy wanted to go bang someone who 'just had the flu, it's not covid bro, quit being paranoid'. In bloomington it's taking a week to get test results back so any possible exposure will mean a lot of week long quarantines waiting for results until you actually get covid.",

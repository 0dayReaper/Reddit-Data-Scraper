    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm planning on attending Butler this fall as a graduate student in the MFA program, and wanted to know how I can arrange to live in any of the apartment options from Apartment Village, Butler Terrace, University Terrance, or South Campus. I'd also like to know how affordable how these options are in comparison to renting an apartment outside of campus.",

            "comment": "Butler on campus housing will be more expensive than commuting in my opinion. The only one that is reasonable is University Terrace or Butler Terrace. Apartment Village is considered the most expensive apartment in Indianapolis for how little square feet you get. Apartment complexes around Michigan are great. Don\u2019t get an apartment near 38th st as it is considered hood.",

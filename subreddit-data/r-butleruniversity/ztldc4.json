I\u2019m a lesbian, so I\u2019m not exactly what you\u2019re looking for haha, but I can assure you that Butler has a large LGBTQ+ presence, both inside and outside of Alliance. In my experience, a lot of LGBT+ students are found in the English, Communication, Psychology, or Theater tracks, but there\u2019s LGBTQ+ presence to be found all over Butler.",

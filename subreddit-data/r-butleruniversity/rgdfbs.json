Butler will reject your commuter status if it isn\u2019t your residential home (a.k.a your parents house).  You\u2019re going to have trouble finding people to live with off campus, because the only people who can are seniors and they signed leases for their senior houses their sophomore year (about 2 years ago).",

If you would like to live off campus, I would suggest reaching out to the study abroad office.  They could tell you who is coming back from studying abroad and needs housing, or senior houses that need a sublease because someone\u2019s studying abroad.",

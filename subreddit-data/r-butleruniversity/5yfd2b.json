Granted, that was 6 years ago, and I was involved in several extracurriculars and don't know how those factored in, but a 3.2 GPA shouldn't be an issue. Butler's always been more concerned about the quality of person, rather that straight-up academics. ",

The only extra-curricular I was involved in prior to college was a neighborhood youth group for five years. Didn't take any AP classes. \nBut I'm also a minority so that may have helped a bit. \n\nBest of luck to you! Butler is a great school and I hope you find your gang of friends that will become your friends for life in the coming years!",

If you're in the area, come to Butler Homecoming October 7-9. Saturday there's a Bulldog Beauty contest featuring dozens of frenchies, American and English Bulldogs in costumes, hosted by Trippy and his family.... it's even more adorable than it sounds",

And each dog is his own person- er, dog. \nI doubt Trip will ever get to the expectations that Blue II set before him, but as Trip gets older he'll mellow out and become a great dog. \n\nI used to LOVE seeing them in the basement of Jordan! I'd visit them every time I had class down there! I saw Blue II a few days before he died, and man that old feller looked in pretty bad shape just due to his old age. RIP Blue II.\n\nOh, Trip and Kaltenmark also live on campus in the Apartment Village. You can see them sometimes playing on the football field. It's really cute, just seeing Trip act like a normal dog instead of a photo shoot prop.",

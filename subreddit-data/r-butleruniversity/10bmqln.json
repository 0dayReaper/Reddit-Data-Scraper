    "postText": "So I'm facing a dilemma. I got into Butler and ISU. My college is paid for, and I'm getting a business degree. so at ISU I would share housing my fraternal twin brother, and I know for sure they would take my 37 transfer credits from duel credit classes in HS. on the other hand, I can go to Butler, which I've wanted to since I was a kid. I have no idea how many of my credits they will accept and I won't be close to family. Any suggestions?",

            "comment": " As a staff member, it\u2019s important to determine what your values are in the situation. For some, being close to family is the most important and that\u2019s the number one goal for others. It\u2019s class-size, community, and opportunity. I can tell you that 37 dual credits WILL transfer, but as with every school, they may not all transfer exactly to replace a class you would have to take at Butler. My guess is at least a couple of those courses would just transfer over as electives. But kudos to you for those credits! I would suggest taking another visit to each school if you haven\u2019t already and really try to experience what it feels like to be a student. Of course, I am not partial, I think Butler is a phenomenal school, especially if your school is paid for you were going to get smaller classes, I type in the community, and there are fantastic fraternities on campus. You\u2019ll have access to real business mentors and you\u2019ll literally have an opportunity to make and sell products as a part of your courses in the business program. Plus, the connections you make are fantastic. But ultimately, it comes down to what values you have, and what matters to you.",

Worse comes out of it you transfer back.\n \nI'd talk to an advisor to see how many will transfer. I just wish butler had full time advisors rather than faculty doubling as them.  \n\nI'd also compare business school rankings.",

They are specifically within the college a student is majoring in, so it provides contextualizar insight and relevant help. Plus: they knew me well because I was in at least one of my advisor\u2019s classes.\n\nPs. Go dawgs! \ud83d\udc3e",

Butler was a great place to do that.",

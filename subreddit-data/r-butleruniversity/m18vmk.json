The experiential learning, whether it\u2019s through your internships or your freshman and sophomore FBE and RBE business classes are crazy valuable. I just graduated last year as a marketing major and strategic communications minor. I can\u2019t speak highly enough of it",

            "comment": "I love LSB. So many opportunities and special treatment you will not get at any other school. In addition to your academic advisor, you have a career mentor which is extremely helpful. LSB will get you where you need to be. You will graduate with at least 2 internships completed and they will connect you with opportunities in the direction of where you want to go in your career. They genuinely care about you as a person and you get a lot of 1-on-1 time with your professors and mentor/advisor which you wouldn't get at a large state university. They give a shit about you and you can tell. Study abroad is set up so you can easily do that if you want to.\n\nFor reference I (20F) am a sophomore studying International Business.",

            "comment": "LSB has some incredible faculty. The amount of individual attention that the professors give you is absolutely unmatched by any bigger school like IU. Profs will know your name, and say hi to you outside of class, and are all really caring, with a few exceptions ofc. The curriculum actually just got updated, so now instead of three econ courses you take two IT courses, which is really important these days. The career mentoring program is really good, you basically get a guide through all four years in addition to your academic advisor. On the whole, I was reluctant to choose LSB when I was a senior but now I think it has been one of the best decisions of my life. (I'm a sophomore MIS major btw)",

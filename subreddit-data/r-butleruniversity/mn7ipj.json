Do they accept these credits as electives or do they allow us to use them towards our major? If you know anything about transfer credits from Minnesota that\u2019s even better!!",

As for the business school, you may be able to apply some specific courses that correspond to Butler\u2019s; in my experience, your academic adviser and the registrar will sort of course match where applicable based on content and difficulty. \n\nI majored in International Studies, Spanish, and Political Science and took pretty closely tied classes (Spanish language, obviously, can be pretty similar from school to school). \n\nI brought in classes that covered both some electives and some coursework. The AP classes/tests are the clearest-cut for getting things totally waived and checked off your list. I ended up totally skipping out on all Texts &amp; Ideas requirements for the core, for example, because I took AP Lit, which gave me a freebie, and then I took a Shakespeare class my freshman fall at a big ten school, which gave me another freebie. Feel free to DM me for any other specifics if you want!",

At a minimum they\u2019ll probably give you general \u201ccredits,\u201d if nothing else - enough to boost your credit count at least",

            "comment": "Current LSB here. You should probably be fine transferring at least some of your courses, but some might just transfer as elective credit. For example, I know English 101/Freshman Comp will NOT get you out of FYS. Butler also really does not enjoy transferring community college business courses, but since you're incoming and not a current student, they will probably let you transfer some, if not all. What courses did you take, if I may ask?\n\nOnce you start at Butler, it will get significantly more challenging for them to approve transfer credits, so lucked out getting yours out of the way! Msg me with any more questions about LSB or if you need any help choosing classes/profs next semester. Welcome to Butler!!!!",

            "comment": "I can't speak for the transfer process itself, because I started at Butler right out of high school, but I know they're very supportive of transfer students!  I was actually in a meeting with the dean of the college not too long ago, and that was a point he brought up - that for whatever reason Butler may have gotten a bad rep in the past for being super selective when it comes to PharmD transfers, but they're working really hard to move past that.\n\nThat being said, I'm getting close to completing the PharmD program and I'm really enjoying it.  The instructor engagement, class climate, local opportunities and program results (which I'm not part of yet but the data is there) are just top-notch.",

                    "comment": "I think it\u2019s considered selective bc the positions left over to fill for transfers are the few based on people who don\u2019t auto advance well. \n\nSo if freshman year starts with 150 prepharmacy but by p1 only 116 are ready to advance, they\u2019ll only accept 4-9 transfers total to bump up the class size. Compare it to a pharmacy school that is a completely open admission process at p1 year and it\u2019s pretty different",

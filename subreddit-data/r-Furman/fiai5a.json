    "postText": "Hey everyone!\nI am currently a high school senior from Maryland who has been accepted to a Furman, but has yet to make a decision for college. Furman is looking more and more likely but I still have some questions\n\n1) I am a white male, but I go to a very diverse high school in a very diverse county. I\u2019ve heard a lot of about issues with diversity at Furman, and am wondering if friend groups, parties, etc tend to be pretty integrated or not, and how diversity (or the lack of it) impacts you at Furman?\n\n2) I\u2019m currently undecided on whether I want to go Greek or not. How big of a role does Greek life play at furman? I\u2019m not a huge weekday party person but I try to go out most weekends. What is the social scene at furman like? On campus, off campus, etc.\n\n3) What is the typical student at Furman like. I wouldn\u2019t classify myself as preppy at all (more artsy) so would I fit in here?\n\nAs you can tell I\u2019m really mostly concerned with student life/social aspects of furman so any other info worth knowing would be awesome. Thanks!\n\nEdit: I want to make it clear that academically, Furman has everything I want, and I feel totally able to challenge myself at Furman. That being said, it would also be nice to find a community I can fit into outside of the classroom.",

            "comment": "Go to furman for the academics and the opportunity to be Greenville/Travelers Rest SC. If you want to be challenged and push yourself in the classroom it is a really great place to do so. There are endless opportunities at your fingertips if you work hard.\n\n If you try to go to Furman to party, be artsy and unique, or try to be WOKE, you\u2019re probably not going to be fulfilled at furman. There is a pretty nice arts and music department, but in order to succeed there you also have to kick ass in the classroom on a day to day basis in your other classes.\n\nHope this helps!",

            "comment": "I\u2019d definitely mostly agree with the other comment.  As someone who does a lot with theatre I will say there is a pretty good artistic community and we have a very committed and talented music and theatre department-as well as other art departments, I just know less about them.  As far as Greek life goes, its something like 50-60% of campus so it\u2019s a pretty big part-although there have been some recent house issues, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll change numbers much.  I\u2019m not personally in a frat, but I have a good group of friends and am close with a number of Greeks.  I would say that if you like to go out on weekends, you can find something or even get some people together yourself.  Most people are pretty friendly.  Diversity is definitely lacked at Furman, but there are people and groups who are trying to improve it.  My four years at Furman have been a bit bizarre, but honestly I\u2019ve really enjoyed especially the last two and I think I\u2019ve made some good friends and grown a lot artistically.  I don\u2019t know if this answers all your questions exactly but let me know if you\u2019re curious about anything else!",

            "comment": "As a current senior at Furman, (white Male from Minnesota) \n\n1. It is super not diverse, I went to a school similar to yours and it takes adjusting. Expect to have classes with almost exclusively white people, you\u2019ll find more people of color amongst groups of athletes and on sports teams. \n\n2. I would advise against pursuing Greek life, I joined and then soon left a fraternity because it wasn\u2019t for me personally. However,  Furman is also moving to remove Greek life from campus, and has banned fraternities from having houses after this semester ends, and having a house to party in was the purpose of Greek life. Parties will likely just take place in north village apartments, they\u2019re super fun! There also the barn nearby (10 min drive) others downtown (the former is lax on fake id\u2019s but downtown is tougher.) \n\n3. Most students are the nerds of our respective high schools. Many are preppy, but you should be able to find your crowd, most people are friendly, clubs, and in particular club sports and intramural sports are great for meeting people too! One of the downsides to Greek life is that you\u2019ll find yourself among a crowd of very similar people, and you may find it\u2019s is even less diverse (both in ethnicity and areas of interest.",

    "postText": "**Not trying to get political, just want to get an authentic idea for how students generally view LGBT people at Furman. If you're not a fan of LGBT people, I'm in no way trying to be trite or dismissive of your views--you're entitled to your own opinion, and I respect that.**\n\nHey, prospective 2023 student here!\n\nFurman has been one of my top schools for a while now, and it's looking like I'll be attending next year. I've been lucky enough to visit campus and meet some of the faculty already, and I have nothing but praise to go around.\n\nHowever, I'm curious about how Furman views LGBT students. Being one myself, I'm worried that I'll be excluded or ostracized in the student body as a result. Furman has a reputation for being a conservative southern prep school, and although its website touts a diverse and open student body, I'm still a bit wary (I doubt any school would advertise itself as anti-LGBT, especially nowadays when diversity is more of a selling point). \n\nI figure students currently going to Furman could give me a better sense of the school's culture. How do students/faculty generally view LGBT students? Have there been any major incidents involving anti-LGBT sentiments? Are there resources available for LGBT students (clubs, hangouts, etc)? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

Take it with a grain of salt and do not take me seriously, but I\u2019m saying this with full sincerity for whatever that\u2019s worth.  Just be open minded for a sec and don\u2019t take anything I\u2019m about to say personally, obviously I do not know you.  \n\nHowever intuition tells me that you\u2019re digging your own grave already.  You and everyone else is going to be ostracized for something sometime.  If you walk in the door with an attitude that your sexual preference affords you immunity then you will have already lost the battle to have a positive lgbtq-at-college experience.  Nobody will play the game by your rules.  Get ready to deal with conflict in a way that gets people to identify you by the quality of your character instead of by so shallow a characteristic as your gender and sexual preference.  \n\nSo I figure you probably were just like \u201cof course that\u2019s not my attitude,\u201d ok good just remember that the first time you\u2019re tempted to accuse someone of calling you out because of your sexual preference when the reality is that you\u2019ve actually just acted like a tool.  How you get treated will depend on how you treat others.  It\u2019s really that simple.  There may be some Christian nut bags or Trump apologists who sneer at you from the shadows but their influence will be minor.  Campus is 95% woke but don\u2019t act entitled to their admiration, that\u2019s the most sure way to get the opposite.  All of this boils down to 2 words Be Humble.  \n\nGood luck.  I love the institution dearly but it is a living thing and like all living things is prone to disease and frailty.  Add health to it.  Act positively.  Be quick to forgive and understand and slow to lash out even if you feel oppressed.  \n\n\n\n\n",

There are tons of very open and kind and welcoming people here and when you find those people I doubt you will ever feel alienated. There are definitely some hateful and homophobic people here, as there will be anywhere. But in my experience they fly in their own flock. The communities I am in are so welcoming I often forget that there are people on campus who arent as kind. Again, this is just my 1 year of experience here, but I do feel like the majority of people here are pro LGBT and those who arent mostly keep it to themselves ",

As in there aren\u2019t really pride events but I haven\u2019t heard of any of my gay friends being harassed for it. Tbh I really like it, it\u2019s not like \u201chooray for being gay\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re going to hell\u201d it\u2019s more just a part of your life that people accept but don\u2019t project.",

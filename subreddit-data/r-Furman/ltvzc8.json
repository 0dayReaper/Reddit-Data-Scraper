    "postText": "For some background, I am a freshman at Furman and I\u2019ve generally been pretty happy with the school. I love the professors and truly believe I will get a great education at Furman. I am aware that this year is vastly different from the average year here but I still worry about the administrations never ending effort to get rid of parties on campus. I chose not to partake in Greek life which presumably lowered my chances at experiencing the \u201ctypical college experience\u201d and I assume that\u2019s why Furman has a bigger Greek life presence than most schools. I\u2019ve also read really concerning online posts pre-pandemic saying \u201cFUPO will shut down gatherings over 8 people because they classify that as a party, alcohol present or not\u201d Right now it seems like I spend the majority of my weekends with friends just brainstorming fun things to do. I am not a student who likes to party a ton. I would never go out during the week but I really want the ability to go to a party to destress on a Friday night. I\u2019m starting to really consider transferring which is a shame. Any insight from upperclassmen would be really appreciated, either telling me I\u2019m crazy or that my fears are true. Thanks.",

            "comment": "I truly believe that your experience is entirely as a result of COVID-19, and not an anti-party culture at Furman. For some background, I am a sophomore at Furman, and most of my freshman year was spent COVID free. There were plenty of \u201cparties\u201d happening both on and off campus. The \u201cBarn\u201d or \u201cpump house\u201d as it is called, is an incredibly popular place for Furman students to go and get their party on with or without alcohol. I do not believe that there is \u201ca never ending effort to get rid of parties on campus\u201d. To address your concern about FUPO, I believe that as long as the gathering is not overly disruptive, you can get away with that large of a gathering just fine. I have been in groups larger than 8 frequently in North Village, and have never had a problem with FUPO attempting to \u201cshut us down\u201d. But also understand that no party here will be like an SEC party with 100+ people and tons of alcohol. The student body simply isn\u2019t large enough for that. \n\nPersonally, I think transferring because of the \u201clack of party life\u201d is slightly ridiculous, but I suppose it depends on what you value in your college experience. You said it yourself that the professors are great and you are receiving a great education at Furman. If you value your education, I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere. I think this school has great professors, and can offer a very personal experience that will enhance your overall college education, and prepare you for your next step. But, if you value the party lifestyle over your education, Clemson is right down the road. \n\nFeel free to message me or reply if you have any questions or want to follow up.",

I probably should have mentioned that sacrificing high quality academics isn\u2019t something I would even remotely consider to have more lively weekends. Covid has made it hard to get a feel for what Furman is usually like and it\u2019s easy to see the negative comments online and assume the worst. I really appreciate the info you shared, thanks once again!",

Movie nights, dances, game nights, competitions, concerts, etc. SGA, FUSAB, and all of the Fraternity/Sorority\u2019s used to host many more events than they do currently, and I hope that those things will return next year.",

    "postText": "I wasn't sure if this broke the rules in the sidebar, but since day 1 of the conference is free, I figured it might be OK. As said, Elia Locardi, Gregory Heisler(he has over 70 covers for TIME magazine), Aaron Nance, and 13 other speakers. If you have any interest in photography, video, film or post production I strongly recommend checking it out! The Expo will take place at the Younts Center and is hosted by the American Society of Media Photographers, South East Chapter. Again, the first day is free, the second day is $39 for students. http://asmpsc.org/sfpc.html",

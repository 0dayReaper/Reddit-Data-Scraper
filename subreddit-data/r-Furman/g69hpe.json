    "postText": "Hey! I am currently attending a community college, and I am trying to decide which colleges I would be interested in transferring too (I plan to apply in the fall). I am from the Greenville area and have a few friends that attend Furman, but they only say things about the social aspect of the school. I toured there back in January and have been there many other times, and I always get a very expensive impression of the school. I had a similar experience touring Wofford. I thought the campus was beautiful and the staff was not snobby like I expected. They talked a lot about internships and studying abroad, but I got suspicious when they didn\u2019t mention the costs a lot. I have alumni in my family so I am aware of how expensive it is. A family was in the tour with me, and I felt bad for them because I could tell a lot of the cost was being hidden during the open presentation. My point of this post is to find out if Furman is worth it. I have talked to a lot of people in the professional world, and I was told a degree from there is highly respected. But during the tour it seemed kind of minimal and they barely talked about the education aspect. So let me know about the education, professors, experiences, financial reality etc.",

            "comment": "I had read your comment to someone else who had a question too and I definitely see where you\u2019re coming from. I really can read between the lines when given information. I had looked at some of the required classes at furman and some of them looked pointless. Also I am really good at math so I was very stunned at all the extra costs I was calculating during my tour. It is just hard for me to believe people who say furman is amazing and the best experience of there life. It looks really bad when a school costs a lot and then the professors are driving Tesla\u2019s and other expensive cars. I have heard that money isn\u2019t put where it should be at the college if you know what I mean. My boyfriend just finished college but he had considered furman and he said it looked like a money scheme. And he\u2019s rich! I think I might need to listen you and him. I was also worried about the atmosphere. I am not poor and I dress nice, but I haven\u2019t lived a lavish lifestyle like my boyfriend has. He warned me that some rich people are stereotypical. Also I\u2019m an ex-christian and really don\u2019t want to deal with people pushing religion on me.",

            "comment": "I had a lot of fun while I was at Furman. All four years there I had a really fun social life. This was back in the days where each fraternity had a house. I made most of my friends through two clubs that I was a part of. My friends ranged from people that were very religious and also very academically minded (more on the nerdy side) and then I also had friends that were very social and spent most of their time partying. This allowed me to get to know a range of people and that was really helpful for my growth as a person. I wasn't in a fraternity but most of my friends were so I got to go to most of the parties. Overall I found people to be welcoming and accepting.\n\nAcademically I liked the classes and most of the professors. I felt that the academics overall were better than the school I went to for graduate school, which was more comparable to your average state school. That being said, I wouldn't say my classes did as much to prepare me for my career, but this is mainly a result of me not having a clear idea of what I wanted for a career. You are definitely able to get a great education at Furman. I would say a big difference you might encounter at a state school is much larger class sizes and professors that are not native English speakers. The academics at Furman will be more difficult in my opinion. During my time there I encountered people that were very serious about their academics and people who were there to party, had to go for five years to graduate and had it paid for by their family (and probably wasted a lot of money). But even the people who lacked discipline were smarter than average.\n\nSo I think it comes down to whether or not you want to pay the premium to go to a school that is more difficult, has a better name (at least in the South, name recognition isn't great elsewhere) and probably a nicer campus versus a state school. So it probably depends a lot on what degree you are pursuing and what your career plans are after school as to whether it would be worth it for you.",

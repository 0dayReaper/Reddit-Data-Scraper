    "postText": "Well Furman finally did it. They eliminated one of the last things that allowed students on this campus to have some fun. With the elimination of fraternity houses there will be next to nothing that students can do that will not be under Furman's microscope. It is ridiculous and sad that they took away the only thing that defined greek life on campus, which will kill greek life and the social scene as we know it. Coming in as a freshmen, after the houses are taken away at the start of next year, what are they going to be able to do if they want to let loose and party a little after the grueling weeks of work their asses of? I feel bad for anyone coming to this school next year for they will be in a prison of professors demanding too much of their students, FUPO giving out over 100 AV's in a single night because they have nothing better to do, and no house parties to escape the bullshit to boot.",

As long as you\u2019re not ridiculously loud, NV is a fine place to chill or party if you don\u2019t have like a billion people.  If you want to be with more people, go to the barn or go dt.  Sure it sucks but yeah we chose to go here and we have to deal.  Go to the town hall and voice your opinion.  I kinda doubt it\u2019ll last anyways because so many people are rightfully upset.  But it isn\u2019t the end of the \u201csocial scene\u201d",

How would they know or even have the jurisdiction to say you can\u2019t go there?  Seems like you all can just keep doing what you\u2019ve been doing and whatever happens furman is like \u201cthis was against the rules so you can\u2019t sue us\u201d",

    "postText": "Hi everyone...I am interested in applying to Furman this year. I am heavily involved in music and musical theater and I didnt really get a clear picture of how it was when I toured. Can non-music majors participate in the school productions? DO they? Thanks! &lt;additionally&gt; I've seen some negative pictures painted about individuality and students into the arts. How do you feel? I don't want to be tricked into a school from good advertising. I was really set on furman but I've seen some comments about the school Ive never seen before so I am unsure.",

            "comment": "I did a lot of theatre while I was at Furman, and didn\u2019t end up majoring. I would say that they are pretty inclusive to non majors and you would definitely be able to participate in the productions if you\u2019re willing to put in the time. That said, they only do one musical every other year. There is an open student musical theatre group on campus as well, but I don\u2019t really have much experience with it. But since most of friends did theatre in one place or the other I can definitely say both groups are full of some wonderful people!\nAs far as your second question, I\u2019m not sure I understand it - are you worried about individual students getting attention from teachers and the department? I\u2019m happy to give my perspective I just don\u2019t want to give you an answer to a question you didn\u2019t ask lol.",

What I mean is, I've seen some comments online by students complaining about a homogenous student body (aka  not a lot of diversity or different interests and views) or that it had cliques like high school. I don't mean racial diversity because the stats are available online, I mean more thought and personality diversity. How do you feel? Thanks!",

So the \u201cclique\u201d idea just more comes from the fact that you\u2019re probably gonna find a group or two you like to be around and you\u2019ll spend most of your time with them - in my opinion. As a more direct answer: I feel like I found there to be a pretty wide diversity of thoughts and interests at Furman, so I think most people could find friends and like-minded people to be around. That said, the majority of students probably are somewhat similar, which is likely why they\u2019re at Furman. Greek life and sports are a pretty big deal, but as someone who didn\u2019t particularly get into them, I didn\u2019t feel \u201cleft out\u201d and I had plenty of friends who were into them.",

I\u2019ll be honest the Furman reddit is not to active in general and there are only like a handful of students I\u2019ve ever seen post. So you may not get many responses here. Not really sure the best place to look, but I think contacting the theatre department would be beneficial, and I think the professors would probably be more than happy to connect you with some current students. You could also look into some of the unofficial Furman insta accounts like FUmissedconnections and see if they\u2019d post your question for people to comment on, but as in with any social media you may not get every perspective.",

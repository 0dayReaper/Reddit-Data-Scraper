Employees participate in approved remote work options.\u201d\n\nOrange phase, which is the more severe phase after yellow, states that...\n\n \u201cThe campus is closed to visitors and university-sponsored off-campus activities are suspended unless approved, on a case-by-case basis\u201d. \n\nSo since we are operating in yellow, I believe that you can go for a lake walk.\n\nAll of this information is available at...\n\nhttps://www.furman.edu/furman-focused/health-resources/covid-19-dashboard/",

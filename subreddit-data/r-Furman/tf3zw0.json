As I have received a full ride the offer is pretty enticing; however from what I have read the comp sci at Furman is not the best. Can any current students or comp sci major lmk how good of a school Furman is for comp sci. For reference I plan on getting a minor in finance, and involving my self in Greek life. From whag I have heard Furman has a great social life l, but I would like so more information on their academics.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m currently a sophomore computer science major! I personally love it so far, but it\u2019s hard. Some of the classes are pretty demanding. However, the chair of the department, Dr. Treu, is incredibly nice and hosts student-faculty dinners every month for a chance for the students to get to know faculty dinner, and are often held either ar on-campus dining areas or off-campus restaurants. Plus, class sizes are small so you\u2019ll get a chance to know the professors if that\u2019s important to you.\n\nCurrently my hardest class is a computer science class. It\u2019s computer organization\u2014essentially we\u2019re learning about the innerworkings of the computer (assembly language, IEEE floating-point standard, execution time, etc.). The professor, Dr. Healy, is incredibly intelligent, though because of that a lot of the material goes over a lot of our heads so we have to ask a lot of questions or study a lot harder. Just know that it\u2019s pretty involved. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019ve heard, and of course every campus has its flaws. You won\u2019t find a university without any. But I think Furman\u2019s pretty great for what it is. I got a research opportunity with one of the computer science professors and will be working with him this summer\u2014and I think that\u2019s pretty big. There will be a lot of opportunities to talk to alums as well and get advice if you really want to be proactive.",

Sounds like furman has a standard comp sci program offered, but not as intensive compared to other schools. Thanks for your feedback! Would you mind if I dm you for future questions about the program?",

I recommend avoiding Treu and Tartaro as much as possible and take as many electives that you're interested in as you can fit in your schedule, since they might not be offered again before you graduate.",

With that being said, that's not the only factor for picking a school, and I attended Furman over other schools with better CS programs for a number of reasons that other people can't really help you quantify such as the campus, distance from home, Greek life, etc.",

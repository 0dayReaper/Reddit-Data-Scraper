    "postText": "Hey people of reddit that also happen to be attending Furman. Had a question for you that hopefully I can find a good answer within here.\n\nCurrently going through the college  process and Furman is one of my top choices, I happened across this whilst browsing Random.\n\nIs Furman a good choice for College? In both academics and social life. \n\nI love the way the campus looks and feels and it has a great business program that I am interested in. Just wondering if this is just a facade for a \"meh\" school or if I should really consider Furman as where I want to attend.\n\nThanks for your help! Really appreciate it.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the input guys I really appreciate your involvment. A little about myself then to help anyone to see if I can fit in more.\n\nI'm from metro Atlanta in Georgia. I'm looking at studying Computer Science with either a Double major or minor in Business. My parents are upper middle class and I will not be having too many issues with money. I have been getting scholarships from the other places I have been accepted and I have applied for the merit and hipp scholarships in Furman. Other places I've been accepted: Georgia Southern, Georgia Tech, Auburn. I've been waiting to hear back from Wake Forest and Bucknell, both of which are in my top 5 choices.\nI am an Eagle Scout with a huge passion for the outdoors, as I write this I actually just returned from a backpacking trip in the Appalachians. That being said I am also reasonable nerdy, I play games all the time etc etc. \nAlthough I play alot of sports (swimming, soccer, XC) I have no interest in sports teams except for Soccer which I know Furman has an awesome team for. \n\nI hear back from Furman in 6 days on whether or not I was accepted so that will obviously be a deal breaker for me haha. Again thanks for your input guys it means alot that you care enough to share your input.\n\n\nEdit 2: **Update Update UPDAAAAATE** I was accepted to Furman (found out yesterday after a state swim meet, wooo I never have to swim again) aaaaand now the wait for scholarships begin. Thanks again for all the help guys  I appreciate the info. Your responses have made my decision easier or maybe harder depending on other college decisions haha.",

It takes some time finding your niche (I still haven't completely found it), but there's something for everyone here. Campus being beautiful is a bonus. AMA. ",

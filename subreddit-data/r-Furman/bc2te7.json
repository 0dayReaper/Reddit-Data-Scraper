    "postText": "Let me start by saying that I am now finishing out my junior year here at Furman and I can confidently say that for over 60k per year. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. The only thing this school cares about is a consistent in flow of money, this place does not give a damn about you after you are here and pay tuition.\n\n\n\nThe professors are completely hit or miss. They are either totally understanding that Furman is hard and therefore are lenient, or they don't give a shit who you are and only care about their research and prestige (lookin at you psych department). I have had teachers who have ignored emails for well over a week, refuse to make set up meeting times for me because I have class when they're free, and even had a teacher straight up tell me \"yea i have seen a lot of students in your position, most of them failed\" when I was sitting their office trying to figure out how to recover a grade. On the flip side I have had teachers go out of their way to stay late to meet, give me extensions, and even curve grades when appropriate. When choosing classes I have learned to not even bother with looking at course descriptions, but rather go straight to RateMyProfessor and choose a class based on which teachers understand we are students and not all aspiring scientists. Lastly, if you like small class sizes thats great.... wait till junior/senior year when you NEED a specific class but because Furman has an image to maintain you won't get it. Furman loves to talk about how low the \"class average\" of students is, but this results in being cut from classes that I NEED because of a recruiting factor that hurts the students already here.\n\n\n\nNext, the 4 year on campus housing that is REQUIRED... this at first could be appealing:  students all live together in close proximity, don't have to worry about parking when going to class (which you can't do anyways but ill get there), and being able to drink in the apartments if you're 21. These positive ideas were crushed upon moving in and finding cockroaches everywhere, and the few appliances we do have (no washer/dryer/dishwasher in the apartments) work only 50% of the time at best. Submitting a maintenance request and actually having someone show up in under a month to fix the problem is like winning the lottery. There is one convenient parking lot that students aren't allowed to park in except for the weekends. If you think about parking really quick to run in somewhere, EXPECT a ticket, don't be surprised at one. Officer 21, our ticketing officer will ticket you after 25 minutes in a 30 minute parking zone. Furman Police are more active, meaner and just outright ASSHOLES than any county police department. I have been followed around campus, cursed at, and stereotyped by these guys who are all protected by this \"private institution.\" These guys love to play Barney Fife and just suffocate the shit out of normal, fun, college activities.     \n\n\n\nThe food.... or i guess i should say the rat poison fed every day of the week that is not an important recruiting day (accepted students day, parents weekend, orientation etc). In my 3 years i have received almost every type of food available raw.... including grilled chicken, hamburgers, chicken tenders (how the fuck do those come out raw?) and almost every \"grilled\" veggie i have received. The food is ALWAYS shitty as hell and typically when it is good, I have forgotten about some event on campus that would require the food to be good so Furman looks good.\n\n\n\nLastly the social aspect. I can just sum this up and say it is nonexistent. If you want to party but aren't 21 and/or involved in greek life.... i wish you the best of luck. That being said, people do find their groups, but if you want a \"typical\" college experience of risky behavior and some wild times, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. Furman has released lists of students names to the bouncers at bars downtown so students get in trouble with the SCHOOL if they try and go downtown under age. Furman is suffocating the shit out of greek life, which is the only way students can go to a normal party without the fear of FUPO busting down the door, while looking for the smallest things to kick greek chapters off. The kangaroo court they call the \"student conduct board\" will vary severely in punishment for things based on who is on the board and how well they know the student in trouble.     \n\n\n\nIn conclusion, if you are the type of person who came to college for a well rounded experience. IM BEGGING YOU TO NOT COME HERE. Now I cannot speak for the brainiacs who are here for nothing more than an education, if you are one of those people then this could be the place for you. But this private institution takes complete advantage of the students who are here for normal college, sucking money from their wallets, encouraging ridiculous amounts of studying while not allowing us to blow off steam on the weekends because of FUPO lurking in the shadows (literally set up speed traps hiding in bushes). I know some people have a good time here... but based on the tears i have shed at this school and seen others shed at this school. This is not a \"safe space\"... im enrolled in hell.",

This whole place is a false advertisement.     \n     \nAnd I didn\u2019t transfer because of admissions people and friends continuing to say things like \u201coh you\u2019ve had bad professors, you didn\u2019t take the right classes, wait till you get the furman advantage\u201d. I believed them and none of that happened. Also wasn\u2019t really able to transfer because Furman course \u201chour\u201d credits is also different from most other colleges which meant if I transferred I\u2019d have to start at a new school a year behind Bc credits weren\u2019t going to transfer. Furmans classes and weighting of them made it highly impractical to leave",

Sorry your experience has sucked. I would recommend to college-age students today to get an associate\u2019s degree before transferring credits and finishing their bachelor\u2019s at a four-year school. This could save students tens of thousands of dollars to receive the same diploma.",

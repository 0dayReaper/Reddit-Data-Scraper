    "postText": "So I guess I've been asking a few questions here lately. And there's one that makes me moderately nervous to ask for several reasons, but, mmn. Oh well.\n\nWhat's the LGBT community like at Furman? Does it exist? Is it tiny? I know there are diversity support groups and the like, but I'm curious to know about the actual community. If there is one. I know it's not the most liberal school.",

You will have no problems making friends as long as your sexuality is not the only interesting part of your personality (think about how annoying a stoner is compared to a normal person that smokes weed. same thing). Assuming you are a gay guy, (I'm not too familiar with the lesbian scene here) dating options are pretty limited but exist. To answer your question I don't know of a \"gay clique\" it seems to me that everyone is friends with whomever regardless of sexuality. That is not to say that some people won't judge you, but hey, what can you do? If you have any other questions throw em my way",

Also, there's an LGBT support group called EROS that was growing and pretty prominent when I was on my way out.  Furman has come a long way in terms of tolerance.  But I agree with the above sentiment that it's more in terms of LGB, and I wouldn't include trans in that.  ",

    "postText": "I am a freshman right now and am a pretty big sports fan. I went to the basketball game against Wofford yesterday and loved the atmosphere. The teams were excited, Wofford had 150 students and we even packed our student section. I know that this is an absolute anomaly of an occurrence, but I would like to change that. Mid-Major schools are starting to create student groups to go create a student section at sporting events and get some energy into stadiums. I want to bring that to Furman next year. We would be a group of around 20 students who would be at all home football, basketball, and soccer games to support the teams and bring some life to the games. Do you think that the students, SGA, and Furman Athletics would support this? Got a clever name? I was thinking the Furman Furies as a play on the Furman Fury app, but that's pretty lame. What do you guys think of this /r/Furman? ",

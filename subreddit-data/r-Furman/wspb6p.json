As someone who was not a music major but who wanted to be involved in ensembles as extracurriculars, it was alienating. But if you want to be a performance major it is probably a good plan. You will be part of a tight knit group. Visit and meet the prof you would study under.",

            "comment": "I chose Furman over UGA.  I loved the trumpet teacher at UGA.  I had a few lessons with him before applying.  However, I felt Furman was a little more well-rounded in terms of the skills I would need as a professional.  I went to a big high school for music.  14% of the student population was in band and we also had an excellent orchestra and chorus.  I saw that many private lessons teachers, who were professional musicians, gave lessons to middle schoolers starting out on similar instruments because sometimes you just can't find a horn/euphonium/trombone teacher.  And again, this was a kick ass school in a major metropolitan area.  I liked how Furman, with its strong music ed program, made sure performance majors had these cross skills too.  It can be the difference between making ends meet and not.  I also liked that I was able to be in SO MANY groups even if it was taxing my last semester.  And the professors were good at ensuring we had Easter gigs if we wanted them.\n\nCaveat: I didn't do much with my music degree after all.  After an attempt at a PhD, I went to law school.  Just wanted to fully disclose my path if that helps with your decision.",

But this is definitely very informative about Furman and I'll continue to consider it!",

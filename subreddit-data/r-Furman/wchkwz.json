At the end of the day, however, it\u2019s just another dorm room and they\u2019re all more or less going to offer the same experiences. Don\u2019t worry too much about it - you\u2019ll enjoy your time, I promise!",

For any of the buildings in soho, get a fan!! When it gets cold and housing turns the heating system on, you will fry without a fan.",

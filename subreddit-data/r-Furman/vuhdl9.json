I've heard that pretty much all of the professors are passionate about what they teach, and I've only personally met one and I can say right off the bat that he seems amazing! Furman so far has been very worth it for me because of how much I received in scholarship money. I applied really as a backup, and if I didn't I would be stuck paying way, way more at a school that wouldn't have been as good of a match for me. Turns out, Furman has been the best choice for me so far.",

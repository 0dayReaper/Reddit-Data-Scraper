They will likely end up rejecting you simply because they take an incredibly small number of transfers each year, and the ones they accept will be coming from places like Harvard, or Japan, or something like that. \n\nSource: my partner tried to do the same thing, was told he had to apply as a transfer with 3 credits on his transcript. The admissions counselor in question should have been fired for telling him that, because it was flat out wrong. If none of your credits transfer, you\u2019re essentially coming in with a blank slate like any other freshman.",

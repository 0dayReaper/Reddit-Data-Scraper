    "postText": "Hey, I'm considering Furman and if you have relation to any of these questions, I would love some feedback! Thanks!\n\n1. How is the premed program / bio major curriculum and grading scale? Do you feel it is both manageable and preparatory!\n2. What is the social atmosphere like? How big is greek life and party culture?\n3. If you have an income of about 65,000 or similar, what kind of scholarship did you receive?\n4. If you had a ACT of 35ish what kind of merit scholarship did you receive?\n5. If Greenville Country a nice place to live? (Working opportunity, volunteer and research?)\n6. Is there a big involvement in clubs and student organizations?",

            "comment": "1) The science departments here are great. Chemistry is the most notable, the bio is next. Both great programs with tons of undergraduate research opportunities. Both manageable and preparatory for sure. Grading scale is typical, or may be a bit harder (Furman not the bio dept) I believe it\u2019s 93-100 4.00, and falls from there, so an A- is a 3.7. \n\n2) if you want Greek life and party culture, you can find it. If not, you won\u2019t see to much of it. About 50% of the campus is in some form of Greek Life. All on campus housing (off campus fraternity/sorority housing has been banned), plenty of fun formals/events/parties if you are in to that, if not, it won\u2019t be shoved down your throat. \n\n3) I would imagine you may receive some form of financial aid. But this money will likely come your FAFSA and not much from Furman. (More on that in 4).\n\n4) Pretty much every student on campus receives the \u201cBell Tower\u201d scholarship. It is dependent on academics, income, race, etc. and is different for pretty much every student. This award ranges from 10k a semester to 20k a semester (from what I\u2019ve seen). If you are a top 1-2% of applicants you can qualify for the Duke scholarship (free ride), other top performers (those with a combo of high academics and leadership/politics/volunteering) may receive the Hollingsworth or Townes scholarships. Both of these are 35k a year. \n\nThere are other smaller scholarships as well for certain majors after you declare. For example I got a $1,500 scholarship a semester from the math department for my junior and senior year. \n\nWith a 35 ACT and your financial standing I would imagine 20-25k bell tower a year. \n\n5) Yes. Greenville is booming. It\u2019s a great place to find internships and research opportunities (but don\u2019t forget about the on campus ones). 15 min drive from campus, beautiful, and bursting with life. \n\n6) Yes. There is a club for just about everything, and there are tons of ways to get involved. SGA and FUSAB are two of the larger student organizations and they put on a ton of activities/events all year. Definitely plenty of opportunities. \n\nLet me know if you have anymore questions!",

    "postText": "hi!! i am coming to furman university in the fall as a freshman and im super excited! unfortunately, i wasn\u2019t able to attend summer orientation since i had a weird situation with my college plans. due to this and the fact that i am in a single dorm, i have not been able to meet anyone going to furman yet. im from virginia, so the school is not as well-known here. does anyone know of any ways i could get in touch with other furman students, incoming or otherwise? i requested to follow the class of 2026 instagram page but haven\u2019t been accepted. i have instagram, snapchat, and discord. if anyone knows of anything, please let me know! can\u2019t wait to come to furman in the fall :)",

Invite people to eat with you, and encourage them to bring their friends. Join clubs and organizations too! \n\nDon\u2019t expect to be friends with everyone you meet, but just remember that everyone\u2019s in the same boat as you. Everyone wants to meet and have a friend, so as long as you\u2019re open about talking to people and being generally nice, you\u2019ll be just fine:) \n\nCan\u2019t wait for you to love Furman like I do!",

I see three tabs, under 'Brunch specials' which I understand meaning that everything on this tab will be available. The other tabs, 'Additional Brunch Favourites' and 'Brunch condiments and extras', what do they mean?\n\nAlso, I was checking the menu out coz I am a vegetarian, how's the vegetarian food at Furman? Any Indian option in the DH?",

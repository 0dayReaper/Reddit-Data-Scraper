    "postText": "Hey Ladies!\n\nGirls Who Hike is starting a new chapter in SC! With so many gorgeous areas in the Upstate, Greenville and the surrounding area will serve as one of the primary regions for day hikes.\n\nWe welcome ladies of ALL fitness levels, experiences, sizes, shapes, races, and beliefs. Our mission is to connect local women to hit the trails together and learn from each other. We educate, encourage, and network with each other to motivate more women to join the outdoors movement.\n\nHikes can range from 3-815miles at a time, but do not hesitate if you're not in the best shape. We will only go as fast as the slowest hiker and will not leave you behind.\n\nGWH is 100% FREE to join! We post events on Facebook so please join us if you're ready to #OptOutside.\n\nLink: https://www.facebook.com/groups/GirlsWhoHikeSC/",

    "postText": "Senior applying to Furman, recently got accepted.\n\nMy mom went to Furman, which was kinda a big drive for me to start looking into the school. We visited Furman back when I was in 8th grade and honestly I really loved the campus and I can still envision myself going there. I also got a Townes scholarship so there'd the added incentive to attend Furman. I've heard varying accounts about Furman's academics and I definitely don't trust their own website and I can't find much information about how their German classes go. \n\nI love Furman, and it'd be nice to head back to my home state but I live across the country now and I don't want to commit to a school so far away when I can go to one closer to home with better prospects. I also don't know much about the party aspect of Furman and Greenville, I've heard that the FU police are really obnoxious to deal with, but would I be able to hang out in a friend's dorm for a small party? \n\nI also want to find out more about sorority and fraternity life, I'm not particularly for joining a sorority because I've heard many horror stories about them, but if Furman is such a small school I'm guessing a good amount of girls are in sororities and I don't want to miss opportunities because of not knowing.\n\nThanks!",

I went from not knowing a word of the language to now having a huge affinity for it, and I\u2019m not even a major. Make sure you take plenty of classes with Frau Culberson, genuinely my favorite professor here. (Also, studying abroad is extremely easy assuming travel gets easier soon, fingers crossed)\n\nParty scene is obviously pretty limited at the moment, but pre-Covid campus was pretty lively. If you\u2019re hoping for big school, hundreds-strong parties, you won\u2019t find them here - but what you describe as sitting with friends in dorms is a daily thing here. \n\nAs far as Greek life is concerned, Furman is super chill with about a 50% involvement rate, so crossover between Greek and non-Greek students is very common. If you wanted a different kind of involvement there are also tons of fantastic student-run organizations with less commitments than a sorority!\n\nHope this helps, lmk if you have any other questions I can answer!",

Really no loss, the faculty is great so you should have a good time no matter what classes you take \ud83d\udc4d",

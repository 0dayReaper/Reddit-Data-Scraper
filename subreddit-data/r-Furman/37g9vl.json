            "comment": "Steam can be accessed via wifi or ethernet, while consoles can only connect thru ethernet AFTER being registered on the network. Google \"register console furman\" and look for the blog post by ITS. Then just follow the simple instructions.\n\nAlso, always register the console with its MAC address. It says you can use the IP but it's been giving me errors when I try it.\n\nOne final note: you will have a Strict NAT type here, so connectivity to your friends will be next to impossible on other campuses. But there's totally not a way around this by buying your own router and setting it up to pipe ethernet thru. And you totally wouldn't need to keep it hidden or anything. I hear they do fine for any futile attempts to bypass their stalwart security though.\n\nGLHF, welcome to Furman.",

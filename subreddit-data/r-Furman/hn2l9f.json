    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m a senior in high school and Furman is one of the schools I plan on applying to soon. \n\nI did a (modified) campus tour a week ago and really loved the campus but obviously my tour was really limited and I didn\u2019t get the real \u201cexperience\u201d of touring\n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t plan on driving when I\u2019m in college. I currently have a license and a car so I could take my car and drive if really necessary but I have a lot of anxiety so I\u2019d prefer to not have to drive. How necessary is it to have a car on campus? I know there\u2019s a trolley that can take you downtown but it was only briefly mentioned by my tour guide. Have any of you ever used the trolley and is there anything you can tell me about it? I read on their website that it runs \u201con a loop\u201d but I\u2019m kind of confused by that\u2014so it waits for you while you\u2019re downtown or does it leave and then you have to make sure you don\u2019t miss it when it comes back? Sorry if that\u2019s a stupid question lol. \n\nThanks in advance :)!",

Furman isn\u2019t really an urban campus where you can get around town by walking, and public transportation isn\u2019t really a thing. The parking system isn\u2019t amazing, but it is very much worth it. Also, it will make your life 1000% easier when moving in or out of dorms.",

            "comment": "I\u2019d recommend you have a car there. The parking passes are somewhat expensive for the restrictive areas where you can park. However you can get away with not buying one. I didn\u2019t buy one all last year and just backed into every spot I parked in. However, if you get caught it\u2019s a $50 ticket. The trolley downtown runs at certain intervals, I believe an hour interval, and if you miss it you\u2019ll have to wait for it again. Also on the weekends the downtown trolley turns into the drunk trolley as a lot of people take it to get to the bars.",

The trolleys and busses aren\u2019t always reliable (and it may still not be a great idea to use public transport next year). A parking pass is $90 for the year, but parking is limited. A car will be great for doing things like going to Cherrydale, the Walmart in TR, or downtown. All of those drives are easy",

I think that\u2019s what gives me the most anxiety with driving, especially when I\u2019m driving around an area I\u2019m not familiar with. Right now I really only drive to school, the gas station, or the mailbox so...lol it\u2019s pretty rough",

Getting to downtown is the longest (~10-15 minutes) but it only takes two turns and you can park in a parking deck fairly cheaply. The grocery stores take about 5 minutes and Cherrydale will take about ten. Those were my frequent haunts and really the only other places I drove were home and to the occasional state park.",

But if you do all your eating at the DH and the paladen you can get away with it pretty easily. Whenever I went to an off campus party or downtown (or church) I had to get a ride with someone however. I didn't feel like I missed out that much not having one but it would have been nice.",

All of your classes and dining options on campus are definitely within walking distance - unless you\u2019re in the outskirts of the North Village (upperclassmen only) and don\u2019t mind a 20 walk at that point. But I do recommend having a car to get off campus - Furman is beautiful, but greenville has a lot to offer that you\u2019re going to want to be able to get to!",

    "postText": "Im writing this post because I'm interested in studying business/finance in college and Furman is a school that has been on my mind. (family member attended and said great things) I'm well aware of the schools great reputation but I was wondering if the business students like the program. I noticed the school doesn't offer a major or minor in finance but includes a finance class in the business block. Im a little worried that if I get a BA in business administration without a concentration I might have a harder time finding a job. I know accounting is a possible major at Furman but I don't think that would hold my interest as much as finance. Would I be better off going to University  of South Carolina or Clemson where I could add on a concentration? Any insight from business majors or alums would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!",

            "comment": "If you are looking to get your CFA after college, Furman would be a waste of $200k+.\n\nYou would be better served attending a university with a finance major if you are dead set on attending college.\n\nQuite frankly, though, you could major in philosophy or psychology and still pass the CFA after college if you are willing to put the time in to study.\n\nSo basically what I'm saying is dont waste your time at college.  Get a job in the finance area out of college, get your Series 7 then study and get your CFA by the time you're 20.  That would be more of an accomplishment than showing someone you graduated from Furman.\n\nThen again, many people say the CFA is obsolete and in my opinion they may be right.  In your lifetime I would imagine machines will eventually be making all the calculations/investment decisions.  What value do humans bring to the equation n reality?  I'd actually say humans serve as an emotional detriment in the decision making process.  So maybe you want to be the guy writing the algo's that make the decisions, not the guy with the CFA getting fired because he no longer serves a purpose.",

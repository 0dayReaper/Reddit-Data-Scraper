    "postText": "Copy of the email informing students: \n\nI write to inform you that the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Supreme Council (the fraternity\u2019s national office) has voted to suspend the SC Phi Chapter of SAE (Furman\u2019s Chapter) effective immediately.  This suspension is in effect at a minimum through the fall 2017. \n\n \n\nStudent Life was notified last week through a credible report, and subsequently confirmed following an internal investigation that the fraternity had engaged in behaviors that put the health of our students at risk. These behaviors are in violation of both University and National policies governing appropriate conduct.   This incident follows a prolonged period of probationary actions spanning several years.\n\n \n\nAll of our social fraternity and sorority organizations, including the SAE chapter, receive significant risk management training each semester.   Unfortunately, SAE has continued to disregard policies, procedures and standards of behavior required on our campus and by their national headquarters.  While many of the young men in the chapter are individually talented, as a whole the chapter has repeatedly failed to meet these shared expectations. \n\n \n\nAt this point, the National Office feels a period of closure is necessary in order to stop this pattern of behavior and enable the chapter to continue at Furman in the future. \n\n \n\nSAE has been in operation at Furman for 147 years, and this has been a difficult decision for all involved.  The University Administration supports the Supreme Council\u2019s decision, and we look forward to the day when a strong and vibrant SAE chapter can return to Furman.\n\n \n\nFurman continues to invest in and acknowledge the positive contributions of fraternities and sororities on our campus.   Student Life would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the importance for all organizations to hold themselves to the high standards of our University community as we continue the nearly 150 year tradition of fraternities and sororities at Furman.",

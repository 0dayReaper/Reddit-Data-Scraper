    "postText": "Hi everyone! I really love Furman and think it\u2019d be a great fit for me and Ive already (stupidly...) applied ED, but the more im thinking about it, the uglier that price tag is looking! \n\nI\u2019m considering going to law school after undergrad, so I\u2019d rather not spend a ton of money on undergrad since law school is so expensive. I guess I never realized how crazy expensive ~30k (assuming that\u2019s how much I\u2019ll have to pay after aid, idk it could be way more) every year for four years is. I\u2019ve been considering attending my way cheaper safety school instead if I can back out of my ED agreement without any penalties. \n\nDid any of you continue your education after going to Furman/are you planning to? Did attending furman kind of bite you in the butt :/ \n\nI really love this school but I\u2019m very nervous lol",

What about Furman is super appealing to you?  Is it something you can find (even if to a lesser degree) elsewhere?  For me, it was the small classes (no way I would have actually graduated if I had gone to a huge state school like UGA).  But for saving ~120k over four years... I could have found cheaper options.  And 15 years out of college no one cares where I went to school, and (thankfully) my GPA hasn't mattered since after my first job.  Do yourself a favor and don't leave school with a massive debt weighing you down.",

I can find the small class sizes (to a lesser escape, but they exist!) at my safety school, and I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s really anything else at Furman that made it unique enough for me to justify going broke there rather than saving my money at my safety school. \n\nGlad to hear where you graduated hasn\u2019t really mattered, I keep hearing that it does and it has me pretty stressed out. \n\nI hope I didn\u2019t mess everything up by applying ED. I\u2019m really nervous about contacting them once I get my aid packet (if I get in) and being penalized for trying to pull out of the deal.",

Furman has an excellent political science department which sends a lot of people to law school, so it may be worth it. I like it here, but the price tag isn\u2019t really worth it for what you get. Also if you\u2019re looking for a strong school spirit or a large party scene, this is not the place for you. Community takes a different form at Furman, typically through clubs or other events rather than through sports",

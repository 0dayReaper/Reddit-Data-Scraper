    "postText": "Hello again, \n\nI have committed to Furman! and I am planning on double majoring in economics and CS( and maybe Philosophy ?). I was wondering how the frats on campus were. I like partying and having fun on the weekend but also the space to be focused on the weekdays. so I was wondering what the advantages/drawbacks of frats are since I don't know much and I am also a transfer student, so I am not sure how that would work.\n\nalso, what are some ways all of you would recommend meeting people and forming meaningful connections at Furman, especially now with Zoom universe? and what are things/clubs/classes definitely worth trying out when you get to campus?",

            "comment": "I know nothing about frats really but there are a lot of people here who love to party. Meet people via on campus activities - there are a lot. There\u2019s also a club called The Pumphouse that everyone calls the barn that is where students go on tuesdays and thursdays, especially LDOC and FDOC (last and first days of class). You can get in at 18 and it\u2019s $5, but free if youre 21+. Connollys is a bar downtown everyone goes to but 21+ only and people only really go on Saturdays. PM me some of your interests and i can help you with finding clubs!",

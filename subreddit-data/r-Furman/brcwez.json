            "comment": "Be careful.  I test well and I tested into the third semester of Spanish.  I was in way over my head.  The professor reviewed grammar the first day and covered 7 tenses I had never heard of.  I went to my advisor to try to get put into the second semester class.  He told me I had done so well on the test that the language professors had a discussion about possibly putting  me into a Spanish literature class.  In that class I would have had to read Spanish novels in Spanish and write papers about them.  In Spanish.  I would have been lucky to get a K in spanish literature.  He wouldn\u2019t approve for me to get out of the class. \n\n At the end of the semester, I did a two day cram session in a desperate attempt to learn enough to get by and ended up with a (rather merciful) C\u2014for the semester.  If you test into a class below your skill level, be grateful for the review and the chance for an easy A.  Testing too high is way worse.",

This picture would have been taken at the old downtown campus, of which little remains - pretty much only Sirrine Stadium (completed 1936), currently in use by Greenville High's Red Raiders, and possibly some old faculty housing.  They attempted to move the bell tower from Old Main to the new campus, but that failed, so they built a replica by the lake.",

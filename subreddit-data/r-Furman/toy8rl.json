If you want a more relaxed dining experience, the dining hall is a great option, as well as many restaurants in the nearby Travelers Rest. I\u2019m partial to Tandem and topsoil. Not a whole lot of casual restaurants that students eat at for dinner. The true Furman experience is going to cook-out at 9:00 after the dining hall closes and you missed it.",

Unfortunately a lot of places have closed since I've been there last.\n\nEdit: oh and it may have been a while since I was there, but if yall have any questions about the music depth, I can try my best.  :)",

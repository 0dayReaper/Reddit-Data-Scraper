    "postText": "I was excited to come to Furman with its beautiful campus and tight knit community. I thought this would be my dream school. However, all of this wore away within a my first year of attendance. I am now a senior and I would give anything to completely forget this place and prevent other students from falling into this trap. \n\n\nI had a verbally abusive roommate freshman year that housing did nothing about even after 8 separate meetings. I needed to change majors after which they took away my entire scholarship and offered no assistance with finding another. The students are generally polite on the surface, but entitled, narcissistic, and manipulative once you get to know them. I started having panic attacks and severe anxiety which I had never before experience the last half of freshman year that I had to leave campus an entire semester to regain come sense of control over. They have a very limited network of alumni as they tend to pump out middle managers, accountants, wives, choir directors, and the occasional med student. As you move towards your later years class regulations only become stricter, rather that trusting a 3rd or 4th year student to know what is in their best interest. Parking is a joke and get stricter every year along with rising penalty fees. You will quickly realize the beauty of this campus is more of a ploy to convince parents this campus is a safe, idyllic place to send their children than something you will ever actually enjoy during your time here. Another aspect that has continually frustrated me is that this campus is incredibly homogeneous. Whatever anyone says about diversity on campus or integration with the surrounding community is a blatant lie. 98% of students are the same person dressed in a different colored polo or riding boots. This is not were you should come if you want to develop a dynamic perspective on the world or engage in unique ideas. Once you're on campus you are a number the same as any larger institution, except to a precious few kind professors and staff. \n\n\nThere are too many facets to my experience to share in a single post. Furman is right for some people, but  can be very wrong and even destructive for others. I spent far too much time wondering why Furman was the only place in the world I had such a difficult time relating to others just to realize that all of the talk about diversity, liberality, and acceptance is nothing more than empty rhetoric. The culture here is an incredibly concentrated and one-sided mix of entitlement, narcissism, and vanity, where very few have made even the smallest effort to develop themselves as individuals or challenge their own perspectives. \n\n\nThis place has helped me form some severe neurosis that will take years to fully come to grips with, and my dearest wish is to prevent other from making the same mistake I did and being taken advantage of by this institution or reduced by the culture it propagates.\n\n\n***This almost exclusively pertains to creative, thoughtful, individualists who care for other people and who truly want to better themselves by engaging in diverse experiences and perspectives. Do some soul searching to really understand what it is you want to achieve through your college experience. My experience in no way applies to those who have no interest in becoming empowered, creative thinkers, who strive to better understand the world from the perspective of others.",

            "comment": "Your mileage may vary. Sorry your roommate was abusive. There's nothing wrong with Furman you won't find at other schools. Your problems are with individual people and not the institution IMO. \n\nTo any prospective students reading this: Visit campus and find out for yourself. I'm a senior as well and have nothing but good things to say about this school. I'm not in a fraternity, I'm not massively popular, and I don't come from a preppy background... but I've still really enjoyed it and found the people to be amazing. Coming to Furman was a great decision for me. Don't let the opinion of one disgruntled person cloud your judgment. \n\nEdit: OP edited his/her post by implying Furman is only for people who don't care for the opinions of others and don't think creatively. What a ridiculous line of reasoning. News flash: Furman isn't high school. You're not the only smart person in your classes. ",

Well, I found the first lot, the bookstore lot, and parked there. $60. Then I got my parking pass, and put it on the front of my car, and went to the soho lot. $40 for the sticker being on the wrong side. ",

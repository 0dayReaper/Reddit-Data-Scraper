    "postText": "I'm considering applying to Berea, but I'm an athiest. I'm not heavily athiestic, and I fully support religion and religious students, but I'm also not personally interested in religious stuff too much. I read that students are required to take an Understandings in Christianity course - is it good? And how much does Christianity \"leak\" into the rest of the college experience?  \n\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I'm a current Junior at Berea College. It's not incredibly religious in the sense that you'll be forced to go to church; many students practice Islam or atheism without issue. Some mandatory assemblies may have an inkling of prayer, but it is incredibly infrequent and you're not likely to be forced into prayer unless you go looking for it.\n\nThat being said, there is one mandatory class called \"understanding of Christianity\" that everyone takes which is offered by a couple dozen professors of caring departments (General Studies-Required 310). It's not religious, but asks you to critically examine scripture with whatever perspective your respective professor requires. There's is also a \"religious perspective\" requirement you must fill with any class that the college designates as qualified to fill it, but if you can't stand am academic environment that is explicitly religious (\"religion\" doesn't have to be Christianity, just any religion taught on campus in a class) then you can take a philosophy class called \"Thinking About God\" that \"examines the metaphysical implications, were there to be a God.\" I'm in it as well as 310 right now, and as an atheist I don't feel pressured to convert in either class whatsoever.\n\nIn summation, you won't be explicitly be indoctrinated but Christianity will crop up time to time. Thankfully it is as open to critical examination as anything else is, so if you have logical reason for being an atheist your opinion will most likely be welcomed in any class.",

            "comment": "Am not a student, so I can only speak to Berea life in general.  It's rural Kentucky, so the local paper lists ~120 churches in the county (90k people total), and the local politics do hew pretty right-wing.  However, it is a very artsy, hippie-esque enclave, and I think the inclusion of students from all over the nation and world (student population is about 10% of the town total) does a great deal to calm any knee-jerk cries of \"heretic!\".  One of the more popular churches here is very progressive and nondemonational.\n\nThe wife and I haven't set foot in a church here except for weddings, blood drives, and the occasional Halloween event.  My daughter says she got some fairly aghast reactions from admitting to her friends that she didn't believe in god, but that was evidently the end of it. We've never been hassled by neighbors, and door-to-door godpeddlers are pretty rare.  We actually know enough other atheists to have our own equinox/solstice parties (any similarity to easter or christmas is purely coincidental :)\n\nIf you do decide to come here, do PM me, would love to know a local Redditor.",

This is interesting.\n\nTo double check - does Thinking About God class allow you to opt out of other religious requirements, or does it simply provide an interesting opportunity to take different perspectives on a god?\n\nAlso - what does the \u201creligious perspective\u201d requirement mean?

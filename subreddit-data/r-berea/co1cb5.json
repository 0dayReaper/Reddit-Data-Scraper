Have made characters in several systems.  Have Dungeon Mastered before, but not looking to in the future.  Could possibly wrangle up to 2 more people.  Would love to find a table in the Berea area.  Male 39 if it matters.\n\nI'd like to play some more PF 1e, though I know 2e is out now.  I'm fairly open, though.",

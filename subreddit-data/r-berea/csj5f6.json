    "postText": "Hi guys, I am looking to apply to Berea college for the fall 2020 semester. However, I have a few questions about your school. For one, my intended major would be computer science, how do you rank your computer science program? (I can't seem to find any reviews online). Do you feel challenged? are there internships? Secondly, I am a non-traditional transfer student and I was wondering if there was housing that had single rooms with private bathrooms? (I am an international student transferring from a texas cc and I did not have shared apartments lol as the younger students are not usually clean). If not are there good off-campus housing for adult students? Finally, How is the city of Berea like? \n\nThank you for all your help.",

            "comment": "I'm not a computer science major (philosophy) but I think I can help you with your other questions.\n\n1. Yes, I feel very challenged here. It varies from major to major, but I personally am expected to read 200-300 pages of reading a week. Course materials themselves are usually not terribly dense, but you're expected to keep up.\n\n2. There are definitely internships! The Office of Internships and Career Development has a website you can check out to see the scope of their functions, but internships are very accessible at Berea. My wife just finished her summer internship, and while it kept her very busy, she felt she made great connections. The college will even pay you if your internship is an unpaid one like hers was! I highly recommend an internship through Berea.\n\n3. I am a non-trad myself, I met my wife as a freshman and we married before starting our junior year. Not-trade accommodation here is outstanding, with my resources and a dedicated committee of non-trad leaders who look out for your interests. In fact, applications for food assistance is incredibly streamlined for Berea students. This leads to your next question...\n\n4. There are 2 options for non-trad housing: off campus apartments, and the Eco-Village. At the start of each semester, you are given a stipend to cover your rent. If you live off-campus, this is given to you directly and you are responsible for making sure your rent gets paid. If you live in Eco, the semester's rent is subtracted from the stipend and you get what is left, with the intent that you will pay your utilities with it. My wife and I live in Eco, which costs less than apartments in the area and is situated right next to campus as well as campus day care, which you can work extra hours on campus to pay for.\n\n5. As amazing as Berea is for non-trads, the city is somewhat dull. The only place to shop is Walmart, you'll have to take the 15 minutes drive to the nearby city of Richmond for anything else. There is not much for entertainment, mostly restaurants that range from fast food to semi fine dining. Again, you'll have to drive to Richmond for anything more, which is not as bad as it may sound but is worth keeping in mind if you demand convenience.\n\nAll in all, this school has some of the best accommodations for non-trads that you'll find from just about any school. I personally recommend Eco Village for housing as you will find many students who share your circumstances, at least more than you would living in a private apartment. The apartments are also spacious and well maintained, with incredible staff to set up events for the residents.",

I am excited and hopeful I will get into Berea and I will definitely look to request Eco Village housing during admission. I am glad you are enjoying it over there and hopefully we will bump into each other because I am looking to minor in philosophy or Math. As far as the city goes, it sounds fine as I am not a party person rather I like trying out different restaurants. Thank you alot!!!",

Using accounts linked to who I actually am is foolish, considering I waved my rights to due process by coming back to the college. I can't make sense of your final statement. You do realize I was arguing against that point, right? If you mean to ridicule that point, don't ridicule it with a statement that is false. Studies show that people unrelated to children are more likely to abuse them than relatives.",

I'm in completely agreement that some of the rules here on campus are contradictory and nonsensical, but the results speak for themselves. The simple fact that we're able to be on campus and study is impressive and testament to the fact that most of the policies are effective, but you're calling for the resignation of the president and the administration because of sex and hanging out with friends?",

I have met some of those delivery drivers who don't wear masks and don't believe covid is real. As a personal note, I would like to see a study on who is following mandates more, delivery drivers or people who are not delivery drivers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, could I not just ask my family members to follow the rules? What about curbside pickup? What is the difference between a delivery driver and family member when it comes to curbside pickup?",

If the rules aren't responsible, what is?\n\nYes the rules are stricter, but compare the amount of cases we had on campus last semester with the amount this semester. Again correlation is not causation but it's hard to ignore the fact that we're better off this semester. If you have a better explanation for the success I'd love to hear it. \n\nI want to emphasize that I agree a lot of the rules dont make complete sense and I disagree with some of them. There are plenty of contradictions, but none of it is detrimental or harmful in my personal opinion. Its inconvenient but I'll take inconvenience if it means I dont have to worry about dying on top of studying.",

Do you have any evidence that these precautions are doing so? Sure, living through a pandemic is a traumatic event, and will certainly have an impact on a child's development, but the masks and the precautions are not the traumatic part, the fear and frustration is.\n\nFrankly, I think a child dying from a 100% preventable illness is stunting a childs growth. I don't think asking them to wear an extra piece of fabric when they're outside is irresponsible or abusive. It would be abusive not to protect them.\n\nOver half a million Americans have died from something that could have been totally avoided, I don't think it's irrational to do my part to prevent more deaths. \n\nI think its become very clear where your priorities lie.",

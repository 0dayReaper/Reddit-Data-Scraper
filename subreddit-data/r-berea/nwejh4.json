All students have a job on campus, but it pays less than minimum wage. Freshmen typically start with janitorial positions or working in the cafeteria, some of the lowest paid positions on campus. \n\nBerea is extremely competitive for international student admissions. Reach out to admissions for more details.\n\nETA: FWIW, i was a student before the recession, when income requirements were lower. My room and board was around $800/semester. You do have to pay each semester up front. You can do this with Kona if you can\u2019t afford to pay.",

You only work 10 hours a week, though, and unless things have changed you\u2019re not allowed to work off-campus.",

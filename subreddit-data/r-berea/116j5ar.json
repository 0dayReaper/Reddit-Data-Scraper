    "postText": "Hey guys. So I am an international and planning to attend Berea. Some reviews are great about the school but definitely I read a couple reviews which said that this is a really bad place to go. That the quality of education is very very low. The professors don't know anything. You're discriminated and treated like a slave and harassed by the faculty. They give you F's D's and C's for no reason.\n\nI want to do CS but i want to be aware of the reality of this college. Is this all true? I mean of course someone for whom it's impossible to attend college it would be a great opportunity anyways. However, as an international I can still study in my home country.  i always wanted to study in the usa but  other colleges are too expensive that is why i chose berea. But as i said i do have the option of studying in my home country. The graduation rate is 52% at berea and avg salary of  graduate is 38k which is very low ig. Is berea college worth it? Should I just attend a college in my home country or go to berea? Please give me an honest review.\n\nAlso I apologize if this post might come off as weird. But i want to know in detail as this will be a big decision",

You'll get a better chance for other international students and alums to chime in. \n\nA friend of mine went the CS route there, and he is pulling ~90k last I heard. There are a good number of career paths if you use the support services the college provides. Another went that route and started with 60k out of the gate. \n\nThe graduation rate is low because they serve a tough demographic all around, but again, if you're one that will use the services on campus and do the work, you'll make it to the stage. \n\nI only had one prof give me a grade I didn't deserve, and they are no longer there.",

It is a very small school in a small corner of Kentucky.\n\nIf all you need is a degree from any institution in the US (like China or South Korea in the 90\u2019s, any American degree was prestigious). But these days, that\u2019s not the case.\n\nThe graduating rate is alarmingly low. You aren\u2019t going to learn much, especially for CS. You will likely only have a quaint American college bubble experience, which is fun.",

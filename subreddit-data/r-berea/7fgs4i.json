    "postText": "I will be starting a new job in March and am looking for housing options in the area that are large dog friendly. I work with a retired racing Greyhound adoption group, and plan to foster and adopt. Does anyone know of any apartments or houses that would be coming up for rent around March/April that would allow large dogs? I am willing to pay a pet deposit and pet rent.\n\nAs for the size of the place, it doesn't need to be huge!\n\n**PREFERENCES**\n\n* Bedrooms: 1+\n\n* Bathrooms: 1+\n\n* W/D: In unit, or hookups. \n\n* First floor/one floor (greyhounds don't do well with steps). \n\n* Location: Berea or Richmond.",

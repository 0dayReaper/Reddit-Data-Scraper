I'm really excited about going here, and my little socialist heart is in love with the Labor Services Program, but I really am nervous about the interview. Any help is appreciated!",

They might ask about your preferences too. (For me, I was placed as a TAD lab assistant because I said I had experience with autoCAD and drafting). \n\nThe worst job on campus is probably working at Food Service because the hours are terrible (open early and close late) and some students are rude. \n\nWhatever you get is your labor position for your entire freshman year and you cannot change it until you're a sophomore. \n\nPM me if you have more questions about anything Berea, I'm a rising senior and I'm very aquainted with the college &amp; town.",

I'm actually going in for Psychology, but I'm not meeting for scheduling classes until around orientation time so I don't know who id ask this question too, but you might know the answer!\n\n&gt;\n\nSo since I'm going to go for a degree in psychology, and I eventually want to get my doctorate, does Berea transfer you to another school after the four years? I know that some colleges, like Bluegrass Community Technical College (a 2 year school) will transfer you to UK (a four year school) for free because they are partnered schools. Do you know if Berea does anything like that? Or is it solely your responsibility to enroll in a new school after graduating from Berea? Sorry if my question doesn't make much sense haha if you don't know the answer that's okay :)",

Good timing too, by the time you get here there will be a fancy new science building up!\n\nAs for grad schools, I'm not really sure if Berea does anything like that. However, if you apply yourself and seek research opportunities with faculty, network at conferences at least once a year, and aim for an internship you are pretty much a perfect candidate to get a full ride to any grad school you want. Berea's education is vigourous and highly sought after. Make good use of the resources offered and they'll slingshot you into the direction you want to go.",

The Seabury Gym is free to all students and family members. Avoid Berea Coffee and Tea. If you want somewhere to hang out, Knight's Lounge is about a 15 minute walk from campus and has card games, video games, and D&amp;D. Just general nerd stuff. There's a nice park with Skateboard ramps and a walking trail down the hill near walmart. You'll find your way around, it's a small town.",

There\u2019s a great library, small business community and lots to do outdoors (hiking/biking/walking trails)\nThere\u2019s a small health food store called Happy Meadows and the farmer\u2019s market is fantastic. For food I would try Papaleno\u2019s, Native Bagel and Noodle Nirvana. There are lots of other great options too. I agree to stay away from BC&amp;T. \nBe sure to check out Robbie books used bookstore as well.",

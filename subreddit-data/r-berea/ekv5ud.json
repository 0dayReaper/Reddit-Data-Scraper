    "postText": "Hi Everyone,   \nI'm a non-traditional (24 y/o) transfer student applying to Berea for admission to Fall 2020. I can't find any information or guidelines for the essay besides the prompt. There doesn't seem to be a word limit. I'm concerned that I'm missing it somehow and my essay will be too long. Does anyone know if there is a word limit for the essay? Could you link me to the specific essay guidelines if I'm somehow missing it? Thanks",

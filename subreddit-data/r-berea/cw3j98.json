            "comment": "Your best bet is really to get in contact with the Admissions Office, as getting into Berea really depends more on you and your circumstances more than your achievements. That being said, I've seen people get in here who did nothing but get good grades and a decent ACT score, so your resum\u00e9 goes beyond most applicants I've known. Your experiences will definitely help, but you should really get in contact with admissions as your financial status and personal interview/statement are more relevant than your academic achievements",

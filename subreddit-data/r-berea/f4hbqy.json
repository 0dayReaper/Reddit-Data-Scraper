    "postText": "My husband and I have been thinking of moving to Berea and going to EKU. I\u2019ve been to the area and really liked it, seems like there\u2019s lots of services around but has a small town feel. What do you like/dislike about living there. I\u2019m from NH and my husband is Aussie. He loves the US and wanted to move to Wyoming. He\u2019s excited about Ky too. Are there good jobs for EMTs? It seems like an affordable place. Also very interested in outdoorsy stuff, have a dog. Would love to hear the locals thoughts, good,bad,ugly.",

There's a Walmart but all the good shopping is in Richmond where eku is. It's a beautiful place and good for hiking and nature and stuff. There's not a lot of other stuff to do. You can dm me about spesific questions you have .",

It is starting to get pretty crowded though, with traffic being backed up pretty far on chestnut street, one of the main roads through the town, around rush hour. Or at least it was when I last lived there a couple years ago.\n\nThe pinnacles are great for hiking and there are a lot of other great trails in the area as well.",

There really isn't a whole lot to do here.\n\nThe weather is fantastic. Gets cold enough for some snow, but not so much that you are shoveling it every other day (in fact this year we've only had two snowfalls with any real depth), and the hot time of year only lasts a few months (coming here from Florida, where the summer heat lasts half the year).\n\nIt's rural Kentucky, with all that entails. But the college, I suspect, has had an immense impact on the place, it's very laid-back.\n\nJob-wise, I dunno. We moved here for my wife's job, but I'm a computer programmer and have mostly had to find places I could work remotely.",

            "comment": "Berea has character but there's a serious drug and theft problem here. Traffic is terrible and there isn't much to do. The outdoor stuff gets crowded unless you get a good ways into Daniel Boone. Most good food options are in Richmond and the stretch of interstate going up is a 24/7 speed trap. I have no idea where all the stray cats from but my god there's a ton. \n\n The students are laid back people for the most part but the majority of everybody else is either strung out white trash or older, hyper religious or a die hard conservative. There's a handful of decent well rounded  folks but unless you live in their neighborhood they're hard to come by. My wife and I (late 20's) moved here two years ago for my job and are honestly moving away to raise our child who's about to turn 1. Since there isn't much to do, you don't meet new people very often and its very much a \"good ol boy\" network around here.\n\nThat said it's pretty and crazy cheap.",

I honestly feel like wherever you go there is one nowadays unless you move somewhere uppety where they push those people out and those places are typically unaffordable. It\u2019s really sad. What do we do but try and coexist. Are you staying in KY?",

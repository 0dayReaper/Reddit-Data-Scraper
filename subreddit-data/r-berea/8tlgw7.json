The way they do it, is that three councilors meet together each representing an incoming student. They debate and make your case and the president of the school decides. So the more personality you put into your essay, the better sense they get of you as a person. \n\n&gt;\n\nThe interview can be intimidating, but just be yourself! My councilor was very awesome and nice and they really are there to help. Don\u2019t overthink your answers either. \n\n&gt;\n\nThe application process is really long, but it gives you lots of time to think over everything and to ask questions. ",

If you have any more questions feel free to message me, I don\u2019t move into dorms until the 18th of August but I can help you the best I can! \n\n&gt;\n\nAnother thing, when I did my essay I asked three of my English teachers if I could share it as a google doc with them and they can make changes. They said yes, and it really helped refine it a lot. So if I were you that\u2019s what I\u2019d do, they\u2019ve seen and even written their own college essays so its good to have their POV. \n\n",

One specific moment that helped shape the person I am today. \n\n&gt;\n\nThe three teachers who helped me all agreed that my first paragraph should be very scenic. Like, use a lot of description words about that experience and set the tone, make it in the moment. If this experience was outside, talk about the sky etc. Then you move on to talking about that experience from the future. Then it would help to talk about how it affected your drive and persistence to learn new things and then about how Berea could fulfill your needs and to help you thrive as a person. When I said put a lot of personality into it, I really meant it. They want to get a sense of you as a person.\n\n&gt;\n\nBut I really would get some extra opinions from teachers you\u2019re close with. They can help smooth it out. Also I\u2019ll message you my Twitter handle!",

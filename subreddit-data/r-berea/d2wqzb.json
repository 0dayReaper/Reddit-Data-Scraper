Someone had their head in their ass and should've known this was coming.\n\nBeing surprised by a problem like this makes me think there is either a cash grab or sloppy governance happening and now we're stuck with higher taxes for the indefinite future.",

            "comment": "Apparently virtually all the people in that jail are simply there awaiting trial.  \n\nhttps://www.richmondregister.com/opinion/columns/spalding-building-a-huge-expensive-jail-would-be-a-big/article_475a7e46-1dc6-59ab-a68e-ef33ecfc4a2f.html\n\n&gt; the Madison County jailer acknowledged that 80% of people incarcerated in the detention center are \"unsentenced,\" which means, for the most part, they are presumed innocent and awaiting trial. When a resident asked how many of these individuals being housed in the Madison County jail were there because they are too poor to afford money bail, the jailer responded, \"I'd say most of them.\"\n\nI.e., if they stopped imprisoning people for the crime of not having enough money, that massively overcrowded jail would be at less than half capacity, instead of more than double.\n\nBut here's the real sickening part.\n\n&gt; To help pay for costs, the proposal anticipates bringing in more people who are incarcerated by the state -- those convicted of a felony in Kentucky that are the responsibility of the Department of Corrections -- for which the state pays approximately $31 a day. Providing federal inmate beds is another part of the revenue-raising plan.\n\nThey want to build a bigger jail so that they can get paid for holding prisoners.  When given the choice between \"do all these people _really_ need to be behind bars\" or doubling down on the very behavior that brought us here, they choose the one that brings in extra cash, and to hell with the human costs.",

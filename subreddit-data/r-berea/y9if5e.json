OP the closest Berea college students get to parties is like , people just being sad and drinking in their dorms. maybe driving 30 mins to an hour away to somewhere actually entertaining in one of the surrounding cities. there is no party scene. Berea college is not a fun school lol. the students and community find a way to make fun sometimes but it's nothing like partying. think more like , walking around in the woods and crying.",

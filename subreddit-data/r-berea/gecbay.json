    "postText": "I\u2019m considering attending berea in the fall, but I have some questions I was hoping someone could maybe answer.\n\n1) I\u2019m trans. Is the culture at berea generally safe? I\u2019d be coming from one of the gayest colleges in the country, so I really don\u2019t know how to gage if I\u2019d be okay somewhere like Berea\n2) I\u2019m also disabled. I\u2019ve heard tell if accessibility issues at berea. Does anyone know how accessible or inaccessible the campus actually is?\n3) I read somewhere that kissing in public, and having sex on campus, are both prohibited. Is that really true?\n4) Is there anything that\u2019s not really said during the admissions process but anyone thinking about going to the school should know? Like not necessarily bad stuff but just - anything?",

There are some buildings that are basically inaccessible, lots of elevator breakdowns. However I know people who have disabilities and have trouble with stairs or are in a motor chair and while they have issues, they manage. \n\n3. Lol no people kiss and have sex frequently. The only thing is freshmen  dorms don't allow co-ed visitation in their first semester. \n\n4. I'm sure I could think of things in more detail but for now - it's not actually a utopia, it is a great college but Berea likes to act like it's a shining beacon when it's not. There's administration issues , the departments don't communicate well, there's accessibility issues on campus etc. But every college is gonna have that problem.",

I know they're trying to improve it (they just put a ramp on Phelps Stokes ) but it ain't th same. My twin sister is a wheelchair (stroller? Idk she doesn't move herself she gets pushed) user and I've grown up with th frustrations of things not being fair for her and I hate to see that stuff on campus. \nFlash backs to the MLK Day convo and they had trouble getting one of the speakers up and down the stage. Like just install a lift man",

Berea College has a fairly strong LGBT+ community and you should have no issue on campus off of campus its a different story its night and day political difference and the towns people are kinda vocal about their hatred of the college and the students. Berea College is also pretty accessible for the most part. You will just have to depend on elevators to get to some locations, especially in the crossroad complex, but for the most part you should be fine. As for the kissing in public and no sex. I never had any issues with doing both. Hell the Alumni building had free condoms on some occasions.",

I agree the college felt safe most of the time &amp; the college never had a problem with me being trans &amp; I found them to be pretty supportive.  Off campus was a different story &amp; I always went with friends when travelling around for safety.",

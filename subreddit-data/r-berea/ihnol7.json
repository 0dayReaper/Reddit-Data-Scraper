    "postText": "I\u2019m really depressed... Berea been my dream school since sophomore year. I took my ACT and got a 17. I have no chance of getting in. My GPA is 3.7 and I took one AP class which was AP HUG freshman year. i told myself I would study for the ACT between The summer of sophomore and junior year. Never did even for a day that summer. I just talked to my boyfriend and watched tv all summer when I should have been studying for the ACT. \n\nMy question is what was your ACT score to get into Berea? \n\nI plan to apply early decision and i plan on taking the ACT again September 12 which I haven\u2019t studied for AT ALL\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14 I don\u2019t have Any time to study because I work two jobs and am taking 5 classes on toP of that. And I\u2019m really behind in all my classes due to procrastinating. In my college algebra class I\u2019m behind on 3 weeks of work. I might end up getting a bad grade in that class tbh.",

Work hard on that personal essay. Do all the bonus stuff (application boosters) that they tell you. Be in frequent contact with your counselor. You got this.",

If you have any demographic information going for you, that can help a lot too. I\u2019m a Latino in Appalachia, so that double whammy probably helped me considerably as well. I applied two times (dropped out the first time) and made it in both times without a sweat.\n\nThey like to get a good diverse spread of students, with specific focus on minorities and kids from impoverished Appalachian communities.",

They are looking for well rounded students who will thrive in Berea's unique setting, so show them what makes you a good fit!\n\nThe work study program is a big part of student life, so speak to your work experience with two jobs in a cover letter. ~~If~~ When you get an interview with an admissions counselor, focus on plenty of things outside of academics... Tell them about any volunteering you've done, or what you're passionate about. Also, applying early will definitely help!\n\nI had my mind set on Berea since 7th grade, so I get where you're coming from. It's scary being so sure about where you want to go when it's not guaranteed that you'll be accepted. Just show how passionately you want to go to Berea in your application, and you should be good.\n\nI hope you ended up taking the ACT again, and hopefully it went a little better! I think they will look at your superscore if you only did better in one or two categories.",

Your ACT test score means nothing in the real world though. No one puts that on a resume. I did have good letters of recommendation though, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s important. Just wanted to share for those low ACT people out there. I used to be very ashamed of my ACT score, because I knew it didn\u2019t reflect my true intelligence. Really just pissed me off and made me work that much harder at Berea.",

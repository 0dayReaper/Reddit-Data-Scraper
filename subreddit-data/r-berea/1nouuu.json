    "postText": "This weekend I'm coming to visit your town and college. I'm considering moving there from NC for school and beautiful mountains. So I was planning on camping in the Daniel Boone National forest, but sadly the parks are closed. Can anyone recommend alternatives in the area? Two camp grounds show up on google maps: Oh! Kentucky and Walnut Meadows. But I only need a couple trees for my hammock or maybe a quiet spot for some car camping. And is there anything that shouldn't be missed in town before I head out?",

There are cross country trails that run back there, and you're not supposed to camp there technically, but we do it all the time.\n\nBe sure to check out BC&amp;T. It's pretty much the heart and soul of Berea. You'll get a good feel of the town and the local elite that frequent the place. It's got free wifi and great fair trade coffee.\n\nPM me if you have any questions.",

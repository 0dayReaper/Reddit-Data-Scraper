This  is a big application  booster, bigger than u realize \n-  Get  at least 2 recommendation  letters\n- if you  get waitlisted , dont fret .me and my roommate got waitlisted , i have several friends that  got waitlisted. \n- if you  dont  get in and  Berea is your only option, reapply for the  next year . Go to community college and volunteer if you can, or work. I have  several friends who had to do this too.\n\nDm me if you need anything or wanna be friends etc",

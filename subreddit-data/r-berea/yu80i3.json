    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a Johnson City TN native and 25 year old Air Force vet, looking to settle my family down and start a permaculture homestead. My wife is black and my son is mixed, she is also a veteran. \n\nOriginally I was looking into Johnson County TN/ Mountain City, but found out that the area would likely not be very welcoming or safe for us. My current plan is looking into the rare small town liberal bastions like Berea KY or Boone NC, in order to still live as rurally as possible but also be near a welcoming culture that influences the surrounding area/community into being more tolerant. \n\nI'm hopeful that people on this sub might be able to confirm for me if that is the case, and/or suggest other areas that I might also be able to look into. \n\nMy primary questions are:\n\n1) Safety and tolerance for black people and mixed race couples\n\n2) cost of large tracts of land (say 5-15 acres?). Can be sloped and forested, ideally with a stream/creek or spring. Doesn't necessarily need to have a house or utilities\n\n3) How distant that land can be from the city/large populations before things start reverting back to regular rural America\n\nThanks anyone for taking the time to read this and respond!",

One thing to note though is that the college is where a lot of the progressive folks come from and the town by comparison is very conservative. The town and the college often butt heads and the townspeople often look down on the college kids. All that to say if most of your interactions are with townspeople and not people from the college, the town will come off as more right leaning that you might have initially thought. I suspect Boone would be the same scenario with App State, but dunno for sure.",

The college brings in people from all over the world, and the student body is a good 10% of the entire town population.\n\nIf you're going to be in rural Kentucky, this is probably the best place for a PoC.  We'd love to have you.",

We went to a protest at the local Spoonbread festival because they were selling confederate flag merch and the responses we got from the people there were very ugly. Our BLM chants were being countered with all lives matter.\n\nGood news is that the chamber of commerce did ban sale of confederate flag merch at the festival very soon after.\n\nAll that to say is that while I think your family would definitely be safe in Berea, they will almost definitely experience some racism. But I guess that\u2019s everywhere, at least in my experience. Berea is one of my favorite places ever though, if that helps, but my experience was deeply entrenched in the college.",

But what we were told is that there is a 30% acceptance rate, maybe higher. I had slightly above average grades and such and didn't have much problem getting in. \n\n2. It's not the best party school. Absolutely no Greek life ( fraternity or sorority) and only a couple bars in town. If you're looking for a more typical house party, you'll need to head to one of the other, bigger colleges nearby. But it is a very inclusive campus with lots of options for clubs and sports. I made some amazing life long friends while there! \n\n3. Yes, the on-campus job pays for everything! Your tuition, meals, and you get extra spending money on top of that! There are however lots of strict rules to the on-campus jobs: every student must have a job. The extra spending money is only about $5 usd an hour. You MUST and can ONLY work 10 hours a week. This is because there is a set budget on how much the school can spend on each student. Your first year your job will be randomly assigned. I was a janitor for a dorm building, but I knew people who worked in the dining hall, the IT department, even the theater\n\n4. You kinda need to make your own fun. Cute stores downtown and good hiking trails, but if you want to do anything else, you'll need to leave the town. The most fun will come from goofing off with friends and whatever clubs you decide to join.",

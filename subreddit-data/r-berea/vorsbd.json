    "postText": "How would you like to be part of a well thought out, organized, and professional Let's Play channel on Youtube!? Well...I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer that, but I do like playing video games while talking about nothing.\n\nHey everyone, Jerm here. So I used to have a retro gaming YT channel back in 2015 that I had to abandon due to a major life change and move. My channel partner wasn't able to come along and I've been looking for another person that I vibe with since then; with no luck. But that could all change!\n\nA little bit about me. I'm a married Army Vet, and now I just work on doors and play video games. I'm not really big into politics, religion, or fanatical cults; but I'd love to have a conversation about 'em. I do enjoy my firearms, and I know how to safely operate and handle them. Not really big into partying as I'd much rather like to stay at home with my dogs (and wife I guess) and binge watch some random show on Netflix while browsing on my phone. But if you break down on the road at like 3 in the morning; you bet your noodle I'll hop in the car and help you out.\n\nCreating gaming content is something that I really enjoy. The whole process of graphic art, video and audio editing, as well as just hanging out with a couple bros and laughing like idiots at a video game is something that I really miss doing. It's just...dang hard to do a solo channel when you're just not all that funny. But yeah, if this is something you might be curious about and wanna talk about, feel free to hit me up on here in a DM, or feel free to reach out to me on Discord at Axe Cannon#1319. Thanks for reading all this in advance!",

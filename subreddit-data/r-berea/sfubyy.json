    "postText": "So I recently sent in my application and I didn't do the best in school which is coming to an end and I'm projected to be at a 3.2 gpa. I opted out of sharing my act scores because I'm not the best at standardized testing. I did however get really good recommendation letters from notable people in the community and teachers and my personal statement looked really stellar. So I must ask do I at least have a shot?",

I made the mistake of getting food from El Mejor, which is more like El Peor. \n\nLegit the worst experience I've had with Mexican food ever. Mariachis wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good. Very forgettable.\n\nDo you know any restaurant around these parts with the tres colores/el banderas on the menu? It's always been my go-to for enchiladas, but concerning that meal, I haven't been able to find a tasty one around these parts at all.",

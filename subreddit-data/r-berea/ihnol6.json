My GPA is 3.7 and I took one AP class which was AP HUG freshman year. i told myself I would study for the ACT between The summer of sophomore and junior year. Never did even for a day that summer. I just talked to my boyfriend and watched tv all summer when I should have been studying for the ACT. \n\nMy question is what was your ACT score to get into Berea? \n\nI plan to apply early decision and i plan on taking the ACT again September 12 which I haven\u2019t studied for AT ALL\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14 I don\u2019t have Any time to study because I work two jobs and am taking 5 classes on toP of that. And I\u2019m really behind in all my classes due to procrastinating. In my college algebra class I\u2019m behind on 3 weeks of work. I might end up getting a bad grade in that class tbh.",

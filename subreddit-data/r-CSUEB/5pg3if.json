I also posted this in the SFSU subforums thank you",

            "comment": "CSUEB offers several options for the CS major. I just wanted the general degree, since most colleges love throwing in physics and higher maths in there when all you're doing or want to do is programming. \n\nAtop of that, I like the program here, it's nice with AMAZING professors. I believe a professor in AI tech is here too and he has several published articles. He's fascinating to listen to. \n\nSF was discouraging because of the SJW scene growing there (although CSUEB has a growing Black Lives Matter community that is kind of annoying) and it was expensive to live on/off campus. (Almost $20k a year before tuition, or $50 a day on travel + food costs to go to school there, not to mention a 2 travel time back and forth).\n",

It's more convenient to me. \"\ninteresting.  are you at CSUEB right now?\nHow are they almost the same; I would like to assume SF has better opportunities.  my family friend's sons went to SFSU for Computer engineering, political sci(as well as SJSU, UCSF) and say SJSU (for C.S.) and SFSU are the best for CS.  \n \nAlso, did not know about mandatory housing.  it is more convenient for me as well as I am from San Jose.  I do not see myself living in SF unless I get campus housing for most of my academic career.",

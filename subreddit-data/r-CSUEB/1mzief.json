Does anyone have experience with the shuttle bus? How much/how long is the trip from Castro valley or Hayward BART?  \n\nLooking forward to the school year!  ",

After that, you can take the shuttle, there is usually a 10 min. wait from the last stop. Just show your card to the driver and you're going to be dropped off near the school's gym (which you may already be paying for, so drop by and check with them if you want; they'll just scan your card to see if you're eligible)",

The shuttles are bumpy, noisy, and crowded, but beggars can't be choosers, and the woman who drives in the evenings to and from Castro Valley is super nice.  She once gave me a recipe for wild sea bass and roast potatoes.  She also apparently once had a cookout at 2 am, and when the police were called, she bribed them with bratwurst.  She's the best.  Also, you're probably paying for the RAW, so as the other person said, that's a pretty neat thing to check out.  (And heads up, don't pay for the school supplies that the bookstore sells.  They are so crazy expensive and not at all worth it.)  Hope you like East Bay!",

They're both about 10-15 minutes long.  What's your major going to be?",

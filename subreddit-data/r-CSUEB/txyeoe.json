Once you hit upper division (or transfer in as a junior), advising is handled by major-specific academic advisors.  95% of our undergraduates have an assigned primary advisor, and, in the College of Science, that percentage is even closer to 100%.\n\nAll four-year program roadmaps for CSUEB are at http://www.csueastbay.edu/aps/roadmaps .\n\nI hope this helps.",

So since I picked up books today from the bookstore, I went to the cashiers office to find out about the refund. So basically by the next financial aid payment ( in January 2021) I will be on track with having the deposit forms filled out. Those who had their info already submitted in time, just wait for your money to drop on your card, and folks in my boat are waiting on the mailman/ woman.",

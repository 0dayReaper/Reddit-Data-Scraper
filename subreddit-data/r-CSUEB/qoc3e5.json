    "postText": "Hi everyone! \n\nI'm currently in the process of adding classes to my shopping cart for the upcoming term and unfortunately my enrollment date is on 11/8. I originally had Professor Negin Toosi as my first choice but it looks like the class is already waitlisted! Does anyone know how flexible the professor is in regards to waitlisted students and how likely would I be able to take the class? The other two options for the class look like hell and I need to take it ASAP to continue onto my Upper Division courses.\n\nThanks in advance!!",

It might be I\u2019m just really lucky, or a lot of people end up dropping out of the waitlist/class before the start of the semester. You\u2019ll likely get into the class you need, that\u2019s been my experience. Just annoying to have to be waitlisted.",

The content and class work is easy and as long as you're polite and don't interrupt while she's lecturing, she's a great professor tbh",

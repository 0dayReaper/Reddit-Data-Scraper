    "postText": "Hi folks so i have two questions. Im currently a freshmen at EB just finished fall semester, about to enter spring semester. Whats the minimum and maximum amount of credits i required to take for the semester? Im at 13 credits atm, i also am waitlisted in econ 200 as number 7 on the list, do i have good chances of getting in despite being 7th? I really need to get into econ 200 bc it fits well into my schedule and i know a friend taking the same course.",

Some professors drop everyone who isn\u2019t there and then adds anyone from the waitlist who is there. Some professor may add more students from the waitlist anyway depending on the class, if they don\u2019t mention the waitlist I\u2019d talk to them after class the first day.",

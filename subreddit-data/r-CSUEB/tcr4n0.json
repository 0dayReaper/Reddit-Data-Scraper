    "postText": "Hey guys! I will be transferring to cal state east bay this upcoming fall semester. I will be relocating to this area. I will be in  Hayward. \n\nBasically I will not know the area nor the school. So I wanted to make some connections/friends. Or just recommendations for the questions listed below.\n\nI'm thinking about picking up volleyball and would like some recommendations. I'm bummed East bay doesn't have a team. But oh well. \n\nAnyone here in the one wheel community? I've been hooked and ride it daily. I'll probably ride around campus if it's allowed. \n\nEdit: I would be interested in starting a one wheel club. A place we can go a ride around and stuff. Maybe talk about modding them. Just chill. \n\nI looked at the clubs online but most of them seem like they are inactive. Anyone have a club they want to advertise for me to join? I want to get more involved. \n\nI'm also just switching over to a new major. Animation and Video Concentration. So I'm super hyped to learn more about this. \n\nJust thought I'd give it a shot. Most people gloss over things like this but I just wanted to see if there's anything out there that I'm missing.",

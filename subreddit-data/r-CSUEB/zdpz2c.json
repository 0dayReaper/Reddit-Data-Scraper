    "postText": "Payments are due tomorrow and the amazing system does not allow students to pay off any less than what they owe. My financial aid only covers my tuition so I only have to pay about $600 out of pocket yet I can't make the payment because the minimum I can pay off is $3500 because my financial aid is still pending. Is there any steps I need to take so it's no longer pending?\n\nThe university website says \"Financial Aid typically disburses within 10 days prior to the start of the academic term\" in regards to the disbursement. Although wouldn't 10 days prior to start of academic turn be on January 7th since classes begin on the 17th for Spring?? And payments are due a month before the disbursement date? I don't get this system and I CANNOT afford to be dropped from my classes on my final semester.",

Any outstanding balance **must be paid before registering for** ***subsequent terms***.\n\nSo basically you have a grace period until Summer registration. They're not going to drop your classes or anything bad, a lot of students are in the same boat. Hope this eases your stress!\n\n[CSUEB tuition &amp; F.A.](https://www.csueastbay.edu/financialaid/tuition-and-fees/index.html)",

Financial aid has a guide on reviewing this info for your account: https://www.csueastbay.edu/financialaid/files/docs/fluid2pdfhowtodethowmuchyouowe.pdf\n\nYou only need to pay the difference between your pending financial aid and the total fee charges in order to avoid being dropped. The payment portal should take a payment of any amount, you would just need to adjust the payment amount to what you would like to pay.",

If your financial aid covers the entirety of your tuition you may continue business as normal and the financial aid award letter will suffice to cover you until then. However if it doesnt cover the entire cost you must pay the projected remaining balance after financial aid, before school starts.",

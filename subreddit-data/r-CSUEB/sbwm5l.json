I didn\u2019t apply for any classes or fafsa this year because I wanted to take a year off and transfer over to east bay with a new major I haven\u2019t taken many classes related to my major at SFSU, so do I just apply to east bay like normal or do I have to do something else? Thanks in advance!",

Then read the info under \"Can I ask questions and get pre-admission counseling?\". I think it's best to talk with someone directly from CSUEB and describe\\* your specific circumstance.  \n\n\n\\*edit: describing --&gt; describe",

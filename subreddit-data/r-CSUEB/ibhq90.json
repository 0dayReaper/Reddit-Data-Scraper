    "postText": "i'm a fresh transfer student, but in my previous college the way i got in waitlisted classes is just sitting in them and asking the professor for an add code. now that all classes are online how would i go about doing that? i have two classes waitlisted--one at #1 and another at #5, but classes are starting tomorrow and i don't see them in blackboard yet. \n\ni'm trying to find their email but the \"faculty &amp; email\" page keeps giving me a gsuite error.\n\nedit: okay, got in touch with someone, apparently their email is just firstname.lastname@csueastbay.edu in case anyone is in the same position as me. also that \"faculty &amp; email\" page is strictly for faculty use so no wonder i kept getting an error... i'm an idiot lol",

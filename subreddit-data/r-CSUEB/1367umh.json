I received an acceptance from SJSU over a month ago, and I initially thought that CSUEB was going to get back to me sooner than SJSU.\n\nBest of luck to you!!",

Unfortunetly, people say they want to diversify the field but continue to gatekeep it financially. Many of the second year placements pay, but not much. I'm getting $6,000 from my placement next year at a community college. That's $6,000 for the whole year. I'm grateful but obviously that's not going to pay the bills or add up to minimum wage. I got $0 at my high school placement this year.",

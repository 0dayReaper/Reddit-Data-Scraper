Couldn't at all be possible (I completed that back in March)- but I went to the Cal Grant Website and there was no hold in site, I had been awarded, everything in my to-do list had been completed as well. Not sure what the mix up is. But I hope I don't lose my classes smh.",

So shitty. Now we wait. I even emailed prior to this and got nothing. They want their money but can't answer emails or even help LOL.",

I'm not sure if that means they're making half of each course to be online so students can choose, or certain classes must be held in person.. like labs.",

There\u2019s maybe a couple of courses that are offered both in person and online, but unfortunately (for me) the big courses that are major required are exclusively offered in person in my department\u2019s case.",

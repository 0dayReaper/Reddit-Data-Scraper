    "postText": "Hello, I am doing a bit of research into the Econ graduate dept. at CSUEB and was wondering if there are any redditors here that are in the program and can share their experience. \n\nI understand this is a small dept. but it is also growing. I am particularly interested in urban/regional and developmental economics and I don't believe there is a focus on developmental econ offered at CSUEB but there is a newly hired Urban specialist now on staff. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with or insight into this program?\n\nThank you in advance for your replies!

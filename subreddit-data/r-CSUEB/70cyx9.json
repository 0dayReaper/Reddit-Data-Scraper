Apprentices will learn to do full-stack web development using JavaScript. After the first trial month, top participants will be invited to continue for five months with stipends. Upon successful completion of six months, top apprentices are placed with partner companies. The next apprenticeship starts in January 2018 in San Francisco. Please see techtonica.org/apprenticeship to see if you're eligible and to apply.  ",

            "comment": "First, you need to determine if they make their tests or if they use a test bank. If they make their tests, they\u2019ll usually hammer a few topics in HARD. They\u2019re passionate about it and spend (slightly) more time on it because they think it\u2019s important. Come to class and pay attention to what gets them super into lecturing. If they use test banks, literally just google quizzlet questions and take the practice quizzes/tests. The test you\u2019ll take should be fairly similar to that. \n\nIt also really helps to get into your professors head. Pay attention to their personality and lecture style. I once had a teacher who loved being known as a hard prof and even gave a little speech in the beginning of the class about how half of the class will likely fail. So, I always knew to just study the hardest and most time consuming concept for our written problem... She wasn\u2019t going to waste my time on small concepts or trick questions. I didn\u2019t have to bother memorizing small things. \n\n\nThe other really important thing is just to review your hw/notes and specifically what questions you struggled to answer. Also, don\u2019t be afraid to make a study-buddy and help each other. One of the best ways to learn is to explain a concept to someone else! It really forces your brain to cement a concept. And hopefully, the person can explain something you\u2019re struggling with too. \n\nGood luck this semester! Hope you make honor roll :\u2019)",

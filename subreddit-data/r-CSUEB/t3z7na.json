    "postText": "Hi all! \n\nI recently got accepted into East Bay for CM and im super excited but i noticed on the ACCE website that East Bay was not listed there but other schools were, like Chico, Sac State, Fresno ... \n\nI was just wondering if anyone could provide insight if that matters or what it means. Does it mean East Bay CM course is not as good as the others? Will it be harder finding a job? \n\nI just wanted to know the difference. \n\nThank you all!",

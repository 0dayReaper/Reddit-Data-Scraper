    "postText": "\"Your application for admission as a graduate student has been carefully reviewed by the CSUEBs Office of Admission and the faculty of the academic department to which you applied. Based on a review of all your application materials, we regret to inform you that you have not been selected for admission. Admission to a graduate program is a competitive process. Not all students who are eligible for admission to the University or to the program can be admitted\" was posted in my last spring 2023 admission status. I want to apply again for fall 2023 admission. Do I stand a chance to make it for a program or should I stop applying for it? I am from mechanical background and have ten years of experience in operations side. I got interest in business analytics. Last one year I automated few Excel projects using VBA, learned python and pandas using  Udemy app.  \nAny suggestions from CSUEB community?",

    "postText": "Hi I had a question about graduation tickets. Last year I attended my nieces graduation and was given a ticket by her but they never actually checked it when I entered. I was hoping to surprise my other niece this year by attending her graduation but I wanted to know if I should get a ticket or could I actually just walk in like last year? Thanks for any help.",

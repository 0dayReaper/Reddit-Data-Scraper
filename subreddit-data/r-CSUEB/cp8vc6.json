    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm applying to the CSUEB Illustration program and was wondering if any current student has thoughts on the program. Since there are no reviews of the program on places like [conceptart.org](https://conceptart.org), I figured I'd check in here. Does anyone have any comparisons to other CSUs that offer Illustration such as Fresno, Fullterton, Northridge and Long Beach? How does it fare against private art schools? Does anyone know of any alumnis whose work I can check out?",

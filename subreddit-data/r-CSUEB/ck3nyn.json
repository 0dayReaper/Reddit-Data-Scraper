How is the party scene there? Is it hard to get into parties? I\u2019m trying to go to sf occasionally and I know there is a bart, but how late does it run?",

It's lame as hell but will probably be more laid back once you're in and you learn to not give a fuck about R.A's\n\nParty scene in the Bay if fun, but East Bay is a commuter school so I don't think the scene around campus is anything special.\n\nBart runs til midnight. Explore other parts of the bay besides SF, too.",

I don\u2019t party, so I don\u2019t know where you would go for that, but I do know that parties don\u2019t tend to happen in the dorms. The loud ones that do happen usually get shut down after 11:00 pm.",

            "comment": "From my experience the Freshman dorms are a bit stricter than the upperclassmen dorms. They'll usually have two people in the front to guard the entrance but they're only there until like 2-3 am. Parties don't really happen in the dorms, there almost always off campus. \n\nBART service ends depending on the last train so I'd go to the website for more info, but there is bus service after midnight. If you're gonna use public transportation get a clipper card, it's more convenient to load money on a card than having to track where you placed separate tickets and passes.",

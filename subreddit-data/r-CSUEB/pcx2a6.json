    "postText": "I have a Lenovo flex five. it\u2019s about six months old and worked with the Edroum Network for about a week and a half and just will not connect to any other CSUEB networks (including edroum) it will connect to hotspot tho. I\u2019ve updated all the drivers and run diagnostics and there\u2019s nothing wrong with the computer. Unless it\u2019s hardware something that the diagnostics cannot detect or The schools Wi-Fi just won\u2019t let me join. IT things to hardware problem but if I can connect to a hotspot I feel like that it\u2019s not.  Any ideas?\n\nUpdate: went to more IT people they have no clue",

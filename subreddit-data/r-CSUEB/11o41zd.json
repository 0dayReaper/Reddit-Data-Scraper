I just visited the campus and to be honest the art building seemed abandoned when compared to the rest. I\u2019m worried this program will not be a fit for me. Does anyone have experience with the program/thoughts?",

            "comment": "Hello!\n\nLuckily for you, I am actually graduating soon with this major in May yhis year.\n\nI will say that the building looks abandoned but its not really. Usually in the courtyard in front there will be activities during lunch time and during big events like club week, where all the clubs will have tables they are usually located there. Its just that the building is one of the older buildings. Cal State East Bay is big on sustainability and they have no reason to fix or rebuild the building soon. The CORE is the newest building on campus to help increase flow through campus but also give a central point between buildings as it is a walkable campus. \n\nDuring the day around 9ish to 3ish is when the building is mostly full of students of many majors, including education, history, art and more. Some classes might be stuck online however but that is changing back. \n\nWe have the makers lab, where the lovely James is, as well as so much equipment we get to learn and use. We have our 3d printers, laser machine, giant printers, like 55in tv size capabilities to print that big. Being an art student you also get access to the green screen room, which is like located near the police station on campus.\n\nClasses in general is game design where you work on making a board game, then digital game, you learn about history of game design and more depending on electives and chosen classes. \n\nInteraction aspect if like making fake apps or websites to use User Experience, such as design colors for feel, button spacing and more. Sounds boring but is really fun when you choose something to create that you are passionate about and really makes a difference and can really help out your portfolio. \n\nOne aspect that I still have struggles with is web design, since it deals with coding, which I'm good at but Tana is a bit weird and shes the only one you got for web design 1 and 2. \n\nThe final thing I would say is, the more effort you put in, the more product will come out. I don't live on campus, and I'm not as social as everyone else but I faked it 'til I made it and now I have friends I actually like. Interaction and Game Design is still a growing major and we wont have top of the art everything but you will learn and it will be fun.",

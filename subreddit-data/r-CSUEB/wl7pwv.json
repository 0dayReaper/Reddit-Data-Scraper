    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI am a transfer student and I accepted my loan offer from the financial aid dashboard and it was a significant amount which let's say, for now, is $3,000. I had an outstanding balance for my tuition of 800$ which my initial financial aid (pell grant) was not able to cover. Will the remaining $2200 from my loans be disbursed to my bank account or not? I just honestly don't know how to pay for my other school-related expenses if disbursements are on the first day of school or if it won't actually be disbursed in the first place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny type of help will be appreciated :)",

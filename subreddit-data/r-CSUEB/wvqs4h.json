I went to the admissions office yesterday (8/22) and they told me they had just received my cal grant and to wait about 2 weeks until I get it. Don't know what is going on. I usually get them both at the same time. I didn't pay anything out of pocket because the Pell covered all tuition fees. I'm just waiting on my free money lol.",

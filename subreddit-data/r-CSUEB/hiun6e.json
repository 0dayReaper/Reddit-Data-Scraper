    "postText": "I\u2019m taking BIOL 310 for fall semester and I\u2019m seeing a lot of mixed reviews about Ken Curr. It looks like generally he\u2019s a tough professor but it\u2019s either he\u2019s disorganized, or he\u2019s just very challenging lol \n\nHas anyone taken him and could give me their opinion on him? Would be much appreciated!",

He did say to study Central Dogma and Amino Acids to prepare for Genetics, good luck though!",

            "comment": "Dr. Curr was my favorite professor. Not because his class was easy but because he's so knowledgeable and passionate. He seems disorganized because there's so much information he wants to ramble on about. His exams are a really pain though, as he will sometimes go out of his way to trick you. Mostly, the exams will require a deeper understanding than what is covered in the lectures which are really broad. I got a B+ in 310 and an A in his 445 course!\n\nExample(infamously): True or false WATSON AND CRICK are scientists.\n\nAnswer: False, since it is all caps it denotes an amino acid chain.",

For me, he is one of my most favorite professors in all the years I have had as an educator. The subject is difficult if you find it dry and don't want to put in the work, but his delivery isn't the problem. Besides, he's not only brilliant, but also deadpan humorous.",

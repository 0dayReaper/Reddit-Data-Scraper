    "postText": "I've been watching videos on youtube and it seems like no one is ever really on campus. It looks a bit empty. But I haven't ever been to the school or even the area, so I can't really pin this as fact lol.  And I do realize it is a commuter school so it worries me a lot. With grants and work-study, this school would be the best option financially, but I don't want to end up at a school I won't like, so I just wanted to see if any students had anything to say about life on campus, or things to do off campus. It would really help put my mind at ease :-)",

            "comment": "I use to work there in student services. PR Director spends most of his day writing positive reviews on multiple sites posing as a student in order to increase enrollment. This is one of the worse CSUs. They have some good majors - Nursing, Speech Comm, Chemistry, Biology, Teaching Credential, some OK - Business, Construction Mgmt, Psychology, etc., and several worthless - Health Sciences, Political Science, Communications (severely impacted). \\`About 40% of freshmen don't return for their second year for numerous reasons - no campus/social life, crappy campus food, 2 career advisors for 13,000+ students, crappy employers coming to career events, location - on a hill away from Hayward and Hayward has a lot of crime and is a low-income city. Worst of all, they are super focused on increasing their graduation levels so their academic advisors monitor freshmen and sophomores - if your grades start to slip, they advise you to go into one of the loser majors or they flat out expel you. Plus, freshmen and sophomores can enroll in classes themselves - advisors do all it, and they monitor everything. Staff and faculty aren't happy so it's a very depressing environment. They're even on the bottom of their own list - https://www.calstate.edu/csu-system/why-the-csu-matters/Pages/best-of-rankings.aspx. Good CSUs - San Jose, Chico, San Diego, Humboldt, Cal Poly SLO, Cal Poly Pomona. Prob more but don't know. Go to Linkedin and type in school and you can see where graduates work and what they do. Hope this helps",

Dorm life (for me) was honestly really awesome, and to this day one of the best decisions I made in my life - specifically because i feel it taught me a sense of maturity.\n\nCampus life was surprising pretty popping. Plenty of people to meet, and Greek life is very active, if that's your cup of tea (I highly recommend).\n\nIt's kind of amazing how many different walks of life I found while I was there. Mind you, I got my own place at the end of my freshman year due to some of the rules that they have while you're there, but the people I met there and the experiences I made made that well worth it.",

I\u2019m not really sure what exact things you are looking to do off campus, but the Bay Area is really big so there shouldn\u2019t be too many problems with finding something to do. Santa Cruz is also about an hour and a half away if you do have a car and want to spend time at the beach or something on the weekends.\n\n\nOne thing I really liked about the dorms it that all the dorms are apartment styled. Once you are out of the main three freshman dorms you will get access to a full sized kitchen, which is really nice.",

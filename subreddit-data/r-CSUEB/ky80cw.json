    "postText": "Hey guys I have a situation where my loans did not covered enough of the tuition I have a scholarship pending and the office said it won\u2019t be distributed into the middle of February. Would the scholarship first pay off the remaining fees that I have or would it just go straight into direct deposit of my bank account. I emailed the Financial Aid office about it but they didn\u2019t really answer my question. I\u2019m just really worried about getting dropped from my classes.",

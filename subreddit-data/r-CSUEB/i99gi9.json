It's a collaboration between the leaders of the chess clubs from colleges around the state. These are statewide competitions jointly held between all California colleges. Many CSU's have joined CICL, and some are founding members who have been around since our first year. CSUEB doesn't have an active chess club, but that doesn't mean we don't want you guys to join. If anything, posting on this subreddit is even more important as a means of reaching out to the chess community in East Bay. Especially in these turbulent times where physical events are not allowed, it's incredibly important that people have the opportunity to interact and participate virtually with the greater community.",

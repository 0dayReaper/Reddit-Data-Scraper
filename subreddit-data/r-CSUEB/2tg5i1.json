    "postText": "Hi and sorry if this is not appropriate, but I live within walking distance of the campus and am trying to find a student to hire for afternoon nannying and occasional date night babysitting.  Any ideas on websites that would be appropriate?  The CSUEB job site doesn't accept this kind of job posting.  Is there another forum (online or on campus) where students would look for this kind of work?",

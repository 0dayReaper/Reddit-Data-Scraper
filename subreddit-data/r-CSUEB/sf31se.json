Any spots with a cafe attached to it so I can get some coffee as well?",

Also, I need a job as a \"work study\" student so i'd also love to work at the bookstore. I applied at the Registrars office but no word back yet. \n\nOnce again thanks. Will definitely PM you in future if I have a quick question lol",

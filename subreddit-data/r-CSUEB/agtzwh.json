I got almost zero feedback for my assignments so that could be an issue if you worry about staying up to date with grades. The minimum/maximum length of the DB posts and responses were the shortest I ever had for an online class (I constantly went over the limit without getting penalized), and the essays were also easy since you had plenty of topics to choose from and iirc you could sometimes come up with your own. While slightly more challenging, the best online class I've ever taken at CSUEB was an upper division history course taught by Dee Andrews. The readings and assignments were a little more time consuming, but I found them to be much more interesting and engaging. Andrews also isn't that strict of a grader and she actually takes time to write useful and encouraging feedback for assignments.",

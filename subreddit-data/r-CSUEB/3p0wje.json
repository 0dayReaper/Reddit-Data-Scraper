What Trindy does is help you with every day choices that you might encounter or need advice on, think \"tinder\" but for everything. We are in need of some awesome CS majors to help us with the launching the app.\nHere is a 30 second demo of the app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiHMAdHvHmE\nWhere we are at:\nWe received a large amount in seed funding to kick this off. Right now we are fine tuning the beta version of the app for a November release, and gathering insider feedback to improve the app as much as possible.\nWhat we need:\nTrindy is a big app and we are looking for the right team to put together too really get this off the ground. We realized that we (2 people) could not do this alone, so we are looking for young creative talent to help us. We are looking for CS who are creative and skillful and are willing to learn the code base of trindy and help us further develop it.\nWhat you need to know:\n-AWS \n-Cloud Front \n-Objective C \n-Java(preferred)\nWhat you get:\nStock in the company -Month to month salary\nWork with a kick ass team\nIf interested please shoot me a message here or at adler@trindy.co\nthanks everyone!",

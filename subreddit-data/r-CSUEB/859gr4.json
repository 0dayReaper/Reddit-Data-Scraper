            "comment": "Hello, I'm a staff member here. This language is on the catalog for the BS in Computer Engineering: \n\"The major consists of 138 units. The B.S. Degree requires 194 units. Students are required to earn a grade \u201cC\u201d or better in MATH 1304, MATH 1305, and MATH 2304.\"\n\nThe catalog is a good resource for checking to see what your major requirements are. However, seeing your major advisor and an AACE Advisor regularly will help you out so much. I graduate people here and I can absolutely tell who has seen advisors and who hasn't. \n\nHere is the link to the catalog. The catalog is a pain to find, but very helpful for those who actually look at it. \nhttp://catalog.csueastbay.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=2&amp;poid=414&amp;hl=%22computer+engineering%22&amp;returnto=search",

My friends and I are going to be taking a trip back to the Bay Area for the week and this Friday, we will be having joining a larger group for a costume party! It will be in San Ramon and it will be a really great opportunity to learn more about what we do, and there will be free food as well! If anyone lives by San Ramon or close by, please come through! Simply send me a message or reply for more info. Thanks!",

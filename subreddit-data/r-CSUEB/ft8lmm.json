    "postText": "I wanted to ask if anyone has some insight in this. I am currently a math major studying at UCSC and I am planning to switch out of this major into Accounting.\n\nWhat are my chances of admission into CSUEB as a transfer. I have &lt; 80 semester units at a 4 year. 120 units (most from community college) overall. GPA of 3.17. Will be completing prerequisites this Fall for Businesss Administration: Accounting.",

You have less than 90 units and over a 3.0 and since you\u2019re completing some business prerequisites beforehand, you should be good. \n\nIdk if the 120 units from community colleges will affect anything but you could always ask the registration department at CSUEB about that.",

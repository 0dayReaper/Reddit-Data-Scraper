After seeing the plans to move online for the fall it brought up questions. Does anyone have any idea what this means for those of us that would live in the dorms? Thanks!",

They moved everyone out in March and the housing office has not been open since.\nStudents who could not return to home were permitted to stay but not without every attempt to resolve their housing issues. Unless you\u2019re otherwise homeless you\u2019ll be expected to stay home until spring. Fall sports are cancelled thus far.",

I\u2019m looking into the non traditional housing and if anyone has experience there I\u2019d appreciate it. \n\nAlso for the CS majors did you have trouble completing the degree in two years? My goal is to come in and hit the studies hard the first year while applying to internships and hoping I get one for summer of 23. \n\nDoes anyone have Co-op experience they can share?  \n\nThanks in advance!",

Write whoismyadvisor@csueastbay.edu to get your roadmap and be put in touch with your advisor and take the classes your advisors recommend (15 units each semester).",

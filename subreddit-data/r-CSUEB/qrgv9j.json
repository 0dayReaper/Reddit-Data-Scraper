    "postText": "Hi, I have recently gotten an admit from CSUEB in the \"MSc Statistics concentration in Data Science\" &amp; the \"MSBA cohort Data Science\" program at UTD. I am extremely confused where I should go. While I understand that both the courses are different in a lot of respects. I am uncertain about the job prospects after CSUEB. I am an international applicant, and would be grateful if someone could take out the time the help me out. Thanks in advance!",

I\u2019m wondering if anyone is in my situation where they lived in San Jose and commuted for the the MS in counseling/MFT option. Was it a hard commute? How was the schedule? Is it doable to attend from San Jose? I also got accepted into counseling program SJSU, but East Bay offers more due to the MFT option. Anything advice would help I am a first generation student and didn\u2019t think of the small details until after getting accepted",

            "comment": "I commute from San Jose too although I'm doing my bs in Business admin so I'm not sure how relevant this'll be to you. it takes me about an hour to commute one way by car and i don't find it hard. I usually take the I-680 north, exit on Mission Blvd especially for my 9:30am classes cause its more convenient for me. there are a lot of stoplights and schools you'd have to watch out for and they've been doing a lot of construction on Mission Blvd lately so more traffic than usual but I'm not sure how it's gonna be in the future. during high traffic times there's not much difference between this route and the other route I take.  the other route I can take is the I-680 south to US-101 to I-880,  exit on Jackson Street but there's usually a lot of traffic on the I-880 and near the Jackson exit at least in the morning.  my schedule mostly consists of 9:30am and 11am start classes and would end at 12:15pm and 1:45pm respectively and I would only go through the I-880 during my 11am start days. I've always taken the opposite of the first route back home so I can't tell you much about other routes coming back but it isn't a bad commute. I did do a 1:15pm to 2:30 class once and the commute to East Bay wasn't bad but the way back was a little more painful because I usually encountered parents picking up their kids from school so there was more traffic on the street",

It's definitely possible since in the program, there's more of a hybrid schedule &amp; enough classes are online to make it doable. i mean, of course it's definitely more convenient to live closer but it's also not impossible to have a 45-50 min commute.",

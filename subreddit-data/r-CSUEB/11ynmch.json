    "postText": "I just wanted to remind everyone that you can see a therapist (in person or virtual) and if needed be recommended to the psychiatrist. It\u2019s included in your tuition, so you don\u2019t pay anything to see them. \n\nI started therapy last month and was prescribed medication by the psychiatrist. Without insurance I paid less than $50 for two prescriptions. \n\nIt\u2019s been really helpful and everyone has been so kind. If you are struggling in any way please use the resources available!",

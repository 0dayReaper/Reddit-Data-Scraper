RAW members can utilize The Relaxation Room to relax, meditate, or powernap. Bean bag chairs, ambient lighting, and a sound machine provide an atmosphere to students for clearing the mind while calming the body. To contribute to the relaxing environment, talking must be kept to a minimum and electronic devices are not allowed.\n\nThe Relaxation Room is a multi-user area and no individual may monopolize space. Individuals must keep the door open for member safety.\"",

Sometimes you have to drive around a bit, but I've never once been completely unable to find a spot somewhere on campus. Now, you may not be able to find a spot right next to your class, but you'll find something. Just get there like, twenty minutes before your class and you should be fine. That should give you enough time to find a spot and walk to your class.",

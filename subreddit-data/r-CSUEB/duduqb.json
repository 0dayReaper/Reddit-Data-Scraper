    "postText": "So I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this. \nBut I finished my cal state applications already, and I applied to 4 schools, one of them being east bay.\nI'm a little confused, because so far three of the schools have emailed me back saying that they will send me a school I.D. to make an account and sign into the student portal. Except only one of the schools actually provided the I.D. in the same email.\nSo for that particular school I signed into the student portal with the I.D and created an account. Once I've made the account, does that mean I've said yes to a school and cant say yes to any other school? Bc I really wanted East bay, I'm super confused.",

The school wasn\u2019t able to find me a student teaching placement the entire first semester. The classes are busy work, I can count on a single hand the amount of useful things I have learned. If you have an issue, good luck getting a hold of someone who will help you.  I know it\u2019s the only affordable, online, state school that\u2019s accredited but I would honestly look elsewhere. Many districts have their own credential program, if I had known about them sooner I would have gone that route .",

Try to get ahead of your work when you aren\u2019t teaching to prevent being overworked when things get busy in the classroom. Start the EdTPA early in February or March and you\u2019ll be ok.",

            "comment": "I see a few negative comments. Let my chime in with my own experience in the program.\n\nI will say the online program felt somewhat unstructured. Many of my courses were asynchronous, or my profs had meetings once every two weeks or so with mostly asynchronous work. For me this was a positive as I had plenty of time to work to afford the cost of living in my area. I did my work when I had extra time. If you like structured practice and feedback or you tend to procrastinate you might struggle with this aspect of the program.\n\nAnother positive is that I liked my professors. The professors I had all seemed to understand that we were being overworked in the classroom and likely worked 2nd or even 3rd jobs to make ends meet. My profs were pretty flexible on due dates, and worked with me when things got busy during student teaching.\n\nI had a neutral/slightly negative experience with my advisor who was supposed to review the lessons I created. She was a nice person, but I think she was slightly out of touch with what a post covid classroom looks like. She was also somewhat slow to provide feedback. \n\nI did receive a timely placement, and I had a great master teacher. I was a little worried because I am not in the Bay Area, but the university came through and drafted an agreement with a local district in my area before the summer ended. My advise is reach out early to districts in the summer and email the university to draft contracts. \n\nThe content in the program courses was fine. I think that\u2019s how many programs are. Because some profs haven\u2019t taught in over a decade (same with the people writing the textbooks). Honestly, you learn the most in the classroom with your master teacher.\n\nAt the end of the day I received a credential and passed the EdTPA, so I am content with my experience.",

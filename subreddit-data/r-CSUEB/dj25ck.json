I need some advises before I decide to apply or not.\nWhat you guys think about this program in general and, how it\u2019s like in our school. Does Csu East Bay offer a good program? \nIs it a good \u201cadd-on\u201d degree to have in the tech field? \nAny advises/suggestions are valuable to me. Thanks!",

I\u2019m now a CS major And enjoying it because I like math lol. Either way he\u2019s okay but I wouldn\u2019t recommend him.",

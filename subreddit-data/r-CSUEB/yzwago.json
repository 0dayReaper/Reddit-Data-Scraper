    "postText": "So I\u2019m a bit on edge since I don\u2019t know exactly what to think about this situation, but what would you guys do if your professor emailed you days after taking an exam and said that he needed to see you in person to talk about it and refuses to say what it is about in an email, zoom or etc. He never emailed me the day after the exam nor pulled me aside in class he just proceeded to email me constantly throughout the day on Thursday and when I told him I was out of town for the holiday break he took my exam grade away and never explained why. He just kept asking to see me in person and when I would be back and that it\u2019s \u201cvery important\u201d. \n\nWhat alarmed me the most was when he asked to meet me on campus during the holiday break and when I was got annoyed and concerned about this I told him I wouldn\u2019t be back until the Monday after Thanksgiving the exam grade was given back, again with no context as to why. I told a classmate about this and she said he never says anything in emails possibly due to not wanting a record and she told me for my own safety to record my interaction with him when I see him in person. Honestly I\u2019m confused and a bit weirded out by this that I don\u2019t even want to have any interactions with my professor anymore, but since he\u2019s playing with my exam grade before finals I might have to. Should I talk to the Dean about this or see what happens on Monday.",

Or perhaps something more somber your grade was not good and he\u2019s offering a make up test but doesn\u2019t want to offer that to the whole class. Sometimes professors do just want to help students pass.\n\nAs women we need to be cautious and I completely would be uncomfortable and worried as well, but it may be smarter first to bring a fellow classmate or have them wait outside and see what it is before jumping to the dean. \n\nAt the end of the day do what you feel is needed of course. Your safety is top priority.",

The removing of grade and then giving it back just seemed odd as if he wanted me to like beg for it or something.  A few of my classmates agreed to be with me both in lab and lecture when he decides to speak with me.",

Many times students would skip a page on their exam. The best way I knew a professor to handle this was contact the student to come into office hours asap regarding their exam, but cannot tell them why. This is due to the fact the student does not get extra study time/ask other students answers/ect. The professor would then address the skipped page and offer the student to finish it there on the spot or accept the grade they have now and not finish it.",

Professors have in-person meetings with students all the time, not sure why the comments are all like \"OmG sOoOoooo ODD bEhavIOR!!!\". Must be a Zoomer thing...\n\nI understand being nervous about not knowing the reason but insinuating it's sexual in nature with 0 proof is irresponsible. At least we don't know who this specific prof is, this is how nasty rumors are created.\n\nYou should always protect yourself but there is a thoughtful/mature way in doing so.

Typically I don\u2019t feel unsafe especially if it\u2019s Monday through Friday. Saturday and Sunday it\u2019s dead, so I\u2019m a bit more vigilant those nights. But I\u2019ve never had anything weird or bad happen walking home at night. Actually on campus it feels even safer as they have security roaming at night. Sometimes I got a little spooked by a car that I felt like was following me but it always turned out to be some high school kid and their parent practicing driving lol. My only recommendation is avoiding BART past 11 pm, as things get a bit weird around that time at that station",

    "postText": "\nHello everyone,\n\nI am transfer student at a community college looking to transfer a CSUEB this fall 2022. However I would definitely need cal grant for the two years I will be enrolled at the university. When I logged in to my csac account, when I clicked on year 2021-2022, it showed the cal grant A is reserved for up two years, and will be released once I transfer to my university. I want to know how will I get my cal grant out from reserve for 2022-2023. I did applied for cal grant for 2022-2023 in January through the fafsa application, and it says awaiting processing for 2022-2023. I don\u2019t know what should I do at this point. But when I clicked on 2021-2022, it showed reserve. How will I get my cal grant out from the community college reserve, so I can pay for my tution for the academic year 2022-2023? Any help would be greatly appreciated, it\u2019s been so stressful.\n\nThank you.",

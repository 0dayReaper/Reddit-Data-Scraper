    "postText": "I'm a community college student transferring this Fall. I applied to CSUEB. I also applied to other schools like SJSU, SFSU, and Stanislaus.\n\nI heard that SJSU is good for tech-related jobs like CS and engineering and good for Business fields like Informational Systems. I heard that SFSU is good for fields like Journalism and Cinema. I also heard that CSUEB is good for Business Administration and Health Sciences/Nursing.\n\nCan anyone tell me which school is good for science majors; more specifically biology?\n\nI plan to major in Microbiology and minor in music.\n\nAlso, I plan to live on campus, and I wondered what transfer dorms you would recommend?",

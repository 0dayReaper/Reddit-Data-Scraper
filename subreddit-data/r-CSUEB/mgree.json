    "postText": "I'm thinking about transferring to CSUEB's Computer Science major soon and was wondering if any current students could share their thoughts about the program.  \n\nTo be honest, I'm attracted to the program because it requires less math and zero physics compared to other schools like SJSU or more UCs.  People would critique that it weakens the CSUEB program, but I embrace the fact I may graduate sooner.",

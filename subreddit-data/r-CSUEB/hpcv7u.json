If so could you please tell me anything of your experience? \n\nOr does anyone have any recommendations for the C4, D4, or B6 courses with an overlay? I\u2019m preparing for a heavy (for me at least) semester and looking for classes that aren\u2019t super hard! Any \u201ceasy A\u201d recommendations or just lighter courses would be appreciated greatly. \n\nAny Upper division GE overlay recommendations in general would be great! Thank you!",

            "comment": "Can't speak on taking any of those courses, but I did take MLL 3812 with Wu a couple of years ago. I started off really interested in the subject (Modern Japanese Short Stories), but the course was just way too damn easy. While the course was paced and structured well enough, the professor hardly communicated with the class so I never knew what to expect from her. If you'd like, I could send you the syllabus so you can get a feel of how her other class would go.\n\nOh shoot, I just realized you were referring to Professor Huitzu Lu instead of Meiling Wu. My bad lol. All three of the professors you mentioned seem to be highly rated on Ratemyprofessor if that helps.",

I actually enrolled in ML 366 this morning and unless I hear reason to do otherwise I\u2019ll probably just keep the class at this point since it does sound quite interesting. Thanks again!",

MLL362 (C4) and MLL366 (D4). If you are interested in Asian culture, I recommend taking her for both.\n\nSame format for all of her classes. You have 3 tries and plenty of time on the exam. If you can find pdf ver of the book, you will pass her exam easily ctrl+F \ud83d\ude09",

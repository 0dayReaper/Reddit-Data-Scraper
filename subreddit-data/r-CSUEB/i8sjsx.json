Yesterday, I had a pending aid amount that was greater than my outstanding charges amount so it should cover everything. Today, my pending aid amount is blank and my outstanding charges amount is still the same amount. Does this mean that my aid was disbursed and the school just has to update the \"outstanding charges\" amount? I'm new to FA, so this might be a simple answer.",

First the pending disbursement disappeared, now the fall semester charges, and when I go to activity, it says the funds were disbursed to the school. Looks like things are just moving really slowly. I was on hold with FA for a good hour before I noticed that something new popped up in my \"activity\" tab under account inquiry.",

Overnight lodging in any vehicle on the grounds or roadways of the university without specific authorization from University Parking Services is prohibited.\n\nIt seems like you can't sleep in your car, but I can't find any rule against just parking overnight. It's outside the permit required times, so I think it should be fine.",

Probably zoom lectures during the time slot you chose for the class or prerecorded, varying from professor to professor depending on how they choose to do things. Most professors sent out emails during the last week of May confirming that the class and lab is to be held online. Hope this helps at all",

Before they were moved it \\*looked\\* like they were going to be in large halls where students can social distance. Those two profs emailed sometime in June to let us know that the onsite courses are moving online. I assume all of them should be doing that.",

You need your NetID and password to access the wifi. If your console isn\u2019t pulling up a web page asking for those, then you may be out of luck.\n\nIf you're looking to kill time by playing video games, there's always the game room near the campus's Taco Bell.",

It\u2019s effectively using the computer as a router, so you\u2019d be connecting to the school network in a pretty roundabout way but it works well. There\u2019s some pretty straightforward tutorials, I can send links if you want...",

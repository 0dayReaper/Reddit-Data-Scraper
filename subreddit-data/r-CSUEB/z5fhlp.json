    "postText": "Hello, I plan to start CSUEB spring of 2023. However \u2014 I\u2019m getting less financial aid than I did when I was in Community College. There is a significant out of pocket cost for me. Very high. I wont be able to cover the cost of living in the Bay Area and attending this school. It located very inconveniently off of the highway. How do people afford these crazy tuition rates? What can I do?",

I personally commute to CSUEB as costs are too high to move nearby. You can also get a loan or apply for scholarships. \n\nThe tuition won\u2019t change much CSU wise, but you can also find a different university/college that suits your needs in a cheaper area.",

If you think 3k a semester is a lot, imagine 7-20k a semester lmao..\n\nPersonally I feel like it makes no sense going to a state school if you can't drive to it from home. That's the whole point of a \"commuter school\" IMHO. I'm surprised you didn't apply to places closer to you.",

I guess it\u2019s better than UC but I saw somewhere state that tuition will be fully covered for UC with a blue &amp; gold promise. That I should and would have probably qualified for.

Tuition is total bullshit IMHO, I feel like state schools should be free. Good luck, it'll be worth it in the end. I dropped out of UCLA in 2013 due to finances and it haunted me until I decided to go back to school. \n\nDid they at least offer Work Study? That's what i'm doing for Spring semester, in addition to pell grant and unsubsidized loan",

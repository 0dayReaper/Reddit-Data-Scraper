This is the first time I've been on the waitlist for courses here at East Bay. What has been your experience being waitlisted? What are the chances of getting in? Is it worth it to email the professor?",

A week and half went by and I started panicking \n\nI had to drop the motherfucker and enrolled with Professor Choy which was the best decision I made",

However if you're still on the waitlist by the time the semester starts, you can always email the professor and they'll take you in and add you to the class. I've had to do that last semester with my Ethics professor.",

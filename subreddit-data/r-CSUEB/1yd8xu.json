    "postText": "Hi fellow pioneers!  \nI am planning a trip to Morocco after graduation in June, and I would really like to have some basic conversational Arabic under my belt (I currently know almost none).  Double bonus points if you are from or have lived in Morocco, and can tell me about fun places to visit.  \nI will have time beginning in the spring quarter to buy you some Starbucks and chat from noon-1pm on Tuesdays and/or Thursdays.  \nI just ask that you are fluent in Arabic and English, and are generally nice :)  \nThanks!",

    "postText": "I just took the English 3000 class for the Writing Standards Requirement. I got the \"grade\" (credit/no credit) on MyCSUEB, but I can't find if I got a Limited Competency, Developing Competency or Clear Competency on the portfolio I submitted. The Testing Office said I should see the result of the portfolio assessment under grades on MyCSUEB, but I don't know where it is.\n\nThanks!",

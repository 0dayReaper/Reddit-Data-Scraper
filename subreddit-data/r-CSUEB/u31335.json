    "postText": "Looking for course advice mainly\n\nHi everyone,my name is Moe. I was wondering if they\u2019re any Poli Sci majors on the Reddit? The reason I ask is that I\u2019m gonna register for classes as an admitted transfer student. I\u2019ve already compiled a list of some courses that interest me and which are all upper division. For the Poli Sci majors here what Econ,Public Admin courses did you take out of curiosity?\n\nI\u2019m just a bit confused on what to take is all I\u2019m looking mainly for 12 units this semester,also any advice on summer courses?",

She\u2019s probably really busy today but I have left her a voicemail and I\u2019m trying to set up an appointment with her ASAP. The reason I\u2019m asking y\u2019all is to see what courses a lot of people enjoyed,ones that people didn\u2019t like,professors that made an impact,etc.",

Which means not much goes on there. I heard UCSD is better for the college experience. \n\nIt was perfect for me because I only had time for school since I was working and commuting to both work and school everyday. \n\nIf I was younger, had less responsibilities and could have afforded a college like UCSD I would have 100% went that route.",

Trust me I\u2019m 28 and if you are just a kid starting out you are better off going to a UC especially if you don\u2019t have work experience. At the end of the day going to school for any type of media or art is a waste of money because it\u2019s your experience in the field that is more important than the degree, so you are better off picking a school that is most enjoyable where you can make connections. *Cough cough* San Diego which is closer to a bigger hub of media companies based out of Los Angeles, than  going to a school in Hayward.  Trust me when I tell you, you don\u2019t want to go to Hayward.  The building are run down and have very little amenities for students.",

Transfers live with other transfers, so not even in ERC, and if you've done IGETC you only have two GE classes: MMW 121 and 122, which is comparable to the best college to be in, Muir, which only has 1 course, MCWP 125.\n\nEdit: also college ONLY affects GEs. Majors aren't related to college at all, there's no difference. There's only one communications Department",

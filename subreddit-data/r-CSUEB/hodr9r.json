            "comment": "Dear Student,\n\nThank you for your message.  We understand that during this difficult time, you are facing many choices.  The decision to continue your education at Cal State East Bay and to make progress toward your degree is a wise choice as it will continue to open doors for you personally and professionally throughout your lifetime.  The university \u2013 at the Chancellor\u2019s Office and across our 23 campuses \u2013 is working hard to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the campus community, and at the same time, maintain academic continuity and our students\u2019 progress toward degree while safeguarding the health and well-being of all students, faculty and staff.  This is, needless to say, a tall order.  Please let us assure you that neither the CSU nor the Cal State East Bay campus is profiting from this pandemic.\n\nYour tuition covers only a portion of the costs to this institution for delivering instruction.  Instruction at Cal state East Bay and on all CSU campuses is being conducted virtually on a temporary basis to ensure that students continue their education and maintain their progress toward degree completion despite the current health crisis.  Tuition will therefore not be refunded or reduced.\n\nSimilarly, campus mandatory fees cover fixed and ongoing expenses and costs that the university continues to incur during the pandemic to finance, maintain and operate student facilities and programs (many of which remain available to students via remote access).  Examples of these costs include, but are not limited to, ongoing administrative and overhead costs such as student government programs (ASI), academic retention and support, progress toward degree completion, employee wages and benefits, expenses for utilities, repair and maintenance, and payment of financing and long-term debt obligations for some facilities.  Students pay campus mandatory fees regardless of whether they are a full time student, part-time student, online student or a student studying abroad \u2013 and even if they do not expect to ever use the programs or facilities they support.  We hope that students understand that if they want the facilities and programs to be available to them now and in the future, they must, of course, be financially supported and maintained during the pandemic.\n\nWe remain committed to assuring that students receive the highest quality learning experience possible given the constraints of physical distancing and are investing considerable university resources, including the emergency funds provided to institutions of higher education by the Federal Government through the CARES Act, to better prepare our faculty and staff to serve students in innovative ways, using new technologies and to assure students\u2019 readiness to enter a new world of work that will surely be driving by the changes we've experienced due to the pandemic.  Our investments will assure that you have access to the instruction, support and resources that you need to be successful \u2013 we believe strongly that these investments will broaden and assure continuity of access for our diverse student body now and into the future.\n\nOver the next several months we will be working hard to increase our communications regarding what the fall will look like, however, as indicated above, we are not reducing tuition and mandatory campus fees because instruction shall continue, along with academic and student services.  Tuition and mandatory fees cover only a small portion of the costs of providing CSU\u2019s educational product.  The State of California pays to the other portion.\n\nThank you again for your email, and we wish you every success in your program.",

I know that we are shifting to online for this semester so do we still have to pay for fees like Health Services when most of us are at home not being able to have availability to these facilities. Or even fees like Athletic fees which seems like there wouldn't be any sports fees happening since we are online this semester? Is there something that is going to be done about these fees like a future refund? I was just curious to know and so are other people that I've been talking to. Thanks!",

    "postText": "I took some classes at a nearby community college during the summer and when I was done I had the classes transferred over. It's been over a month since the transcript arrived at East Bay and the credit still hasn't shown up. One class is a prerequisite to a class I am taking in the fall so I'm worried about it. For any who has taken a few summer classes and transferred them, do you remember who long it took for the credit to show up?",

How is the vibe of the program? Is it super competitive or more friendly (if that\u2019s the right word)?\n3. Are they\u2019re clubs or study groups and how are those if you know?\n4. Anything else you\u2019d likely share\n\nTHANK YOU!!",

            "comment": "I'm starting CSUEB in Spring 23, so I can't tell you much about it from experience. But I've attended both the CS and general Orientation (both online and in person), met the department director, a few CS professors, and many fellow CS sudents. \n\n1. While CSUEB isn't a highly ranked school, it seems like the CS department takes themselves very seriously. \"CS 301\" (the required data structures course) was ranked #1 hardest course the entire University had to offer just a few years ago. It's no longer #1 hardest but it's still top 10 I think. In terms of difficulty, that depends on your previous experience and expectations. Most Community College CS courses are an absolute joke, so expect them to be more challenging than those. If your standards are just passing courses with a C, that will be easy. But job market is competitive so the hard part comes from doing all the \"extra\" stuff (high GPA, teacher recommendations, internships, building a unique portfolio, networking, events, certificates, unique projects, etc)\n2. CS only becomes competitive when you're applying for jobs. Nobody is competitive in school. Grades aren't curve-based like other subjects. At Orientation, the guys I meet were very friendly and outgoing. We were actually the most friendly and talkative out of all of the other majors in the room (and they say computer nerds are the socially awkward ones!!). That should tell you something. \n3. No clue about clubs tbh, but i'd be VERY surprised if there isn't at least one main programmer's club. Every school has one. Study groups is class based I think. Personally I always make sure there is a Discord created for every class. The CS department has a room where tutors help you with your assignments and projects so i'm sure people meet up there too.\n\nGood luck on your decision!",

            "comment": "Hey! I am a transfer student so I can\u2019t speak to the lower division courses here but I can tell you what I know so far. \n\n1) Course difficulty depends on the subject, professor, and any knowledge you bring into the class. The ones where you have previous knowledge will generally be easier. But there are professors here that make their classes difficult. This can be because of the material or because the teacher themselves are bad at teaching. \n\n2) The vibe is pretty chill from what I\u2019ve seen. If you can meet a few classmates then you\u2019ll have a group of people with common interests you can relate to. There are several discords for the classes/school and a lot of CS students talk there. I\u2019ve found my classmates to be friendly, even if they\u2019re competitive. Most of us want to succeed and don\u2019t mind helping each other out. You may get stuck one day, so always be kind. \n\n3) There are a few clubs, but I\u2019m not sure how active they are. You have the IEEE, ACM-W, and GDSC (might be wrong on that last one). All clubs have a friendly vibe but didn\u2019t necessarily have a ton of meetings. I might\u2019ve just missed them though with work and studying. They do have a couple hackathons and such though, so try to go if you can. \n\n4) CS is a hard major if you don\u2019t practice and study. You don\u2019t need to be a person who lives, breathes, and eats it 24/7, but know there are people who do. Most are down to earth people who want to graduate and get a high paying job. But that\u2019s everywhere you go.",

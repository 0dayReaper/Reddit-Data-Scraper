I also suggest not skipping any courses that are in sequence (eg: Taking O Chem without having taken chem I and II) I say this simply because some courses require you to know the basics and foundations of the prerequired course\u2019s concepts. The challenge for me taking calculus this year was having to review algebra (last class i took was 3-4 years ago) on top of learning calculus concepts.",

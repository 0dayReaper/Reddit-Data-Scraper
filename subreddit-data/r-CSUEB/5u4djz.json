I definitely recommend starting with just 12 units in the first quarter and take classes back to back - you'll have some overlapping people and you can do a study group or study buddy. There are a ton of nice places to study on campus. I am a commuter but I still go to school to study after work and stuff. It's rigorous but a good school",

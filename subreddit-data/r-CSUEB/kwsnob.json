My financial aid info is still all the same, same disbursement date 1/13/21. I'm not quite worried yet though, it always seems to take several days after the disbursement day for things to move along. Just make sure you don't have any pending holds on your accounts, and make sure you offered/accepted financial aid is accurate.",

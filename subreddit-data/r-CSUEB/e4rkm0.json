    "postText": "How fast does it take for  a Switch to download a 30 GB game (NBA 2K20)? I went over my data limit this month and don\u2019t want to risk being charged more for extra GB.\n\nCan I  download it when I\u2019m in lecture for an hour. Is that good enough time?\n\nOr should I do it on a full day of classes? Will moving around from classes affect download speed or rate?\n\nHow long will it take?",

I don\u2019t have a switch, but for my PC it takes about a half hour for 30GB in areas with better internet, but can take hours in areas with worse internet.",

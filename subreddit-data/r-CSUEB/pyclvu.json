I just want to know when I transfer to CSUEB, what language will I be working with? \nI only have experience with c++, if I I\u2019ll use another different language like Java, will CSUEB expect me to know Java or will they teach me Java?\n\nThank you.",

So you should be set if you have a lot of experience with it! \n\nClasses like CS 401 (Software Engineering) use Java. But they will teach you. I think it\u2019s best if you can try and get familiar with the language before you take that class. I\u2019ve noticed a lot of the classes are a mix of Java / C++ depending on what you take! But it\u2019s better safe than sorry",

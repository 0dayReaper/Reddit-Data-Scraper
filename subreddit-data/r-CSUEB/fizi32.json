The career services was somewhat helpful but the meet the firms was most important in getting exposure to firms. Plenty of people got internships. I had a few interviews but accepted an internship/job outside of CSU East Bay's recruitment.",

All my work experience has been with government accounting. I\u2019ve got some friends who worked from big 4 accounting and mid size firms but the life of a public accountant wasn\u2019t something I was super into and I valued work life balance at the expense of quick promotions and raises.",

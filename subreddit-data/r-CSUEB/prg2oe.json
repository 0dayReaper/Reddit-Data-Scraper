In the MSBA catalog it said the admission rate is around 40-50% but i didn't see a stats for the MS Statistic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance",

I am confused about whether I should go for a core ms in data science program from other universities or ms in statistics with a concentration in data science. I'm a EEE major with a minor in Design from a university in India.  I am planning to apply in the spring semester.",

I like that they're a more applied statistics curriculum so they're a lot more focused on application without sacrificing theory.  Teachers are very helpful and supportive as almost every week, you get emails about job opportunities for stats majors from the stats department so they do help in the job front for sure.\n\nCompared to a data science program, I feel that a ln MS in Statistics would be a better option as it's more broad and if data science doesn't work out, you can always fall back to Statistics (which is far more broad and more easily recognized as a degree program when compared to the more newer data science degree).",

Not that you can't get a job working in the industry with it or that it won't teach you practical skills such as coding in R, but it's generally less applied than the coursework at CSUEB",

So is this program good enough from employment after graduation perspective? I have read that people pursuing Masters in Statistics in general manage to get entry level data science jobs after graduation or as Data Analysts. Do you have an idea about how job outcomes of your senior batches? Like what sort of roles do they manage to get and what are their starting salaries? \n\n-&gt; What about the internships? Are there any internship fairs/ portals by University or do you need to get one through networking/ linkedin on your own? And can you tell how difficult is it to get the internship in DS domain for someone coming from Non CS Background?",

He works at a community college as a research analyst.\n\n\\- Another one I met at CSU East Bay works at Kaiser Permanente (a healthcare company) as a data analyst and she makes about $110,000 a year\n\nThat's as far as I know so far, but the job prospects for this major are fairly good from my view.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Internships**\n\nIt really depends on what you find and make of your time in school.  The Statistics department here are pretty proactive in keeping you informed monthly about new job and research opportunities for you to apply to.  \r  \n\r  \nOn top of that, CSU East Bay has an online job board through Handshake as well as online and in-person job fairs where you get to connect with and meet professionals from various different companies, such as Google and Intel.\r  \n\r  \nWhat I can tell is that regardless of the situation, it's important to NETWORK -  get to know your classmates, form study groups if you can and like, connect with your professors during office hours, ask questions, and most of all, explore your campus.  It doesn't hurt to have extra friends or connections wherever you go.\r  \n\n\n**Having a Non-DS Background**\n\nI don't think it'll hold you back too much if you don't have that background from the get-go.  We have and serve students from all different majors in this program (i.e. English, Political Science, Biology, Psychology, etc) so it's highly possible for someone with a non-DS background to succeed in this field.\n\n A lot of what you learn in this program will give you a foundation that allows you to really get into some statistics/data science jobs for sure.  What I will say is that it helps to learn more on your own as much as you can - join the American Statistical Association or a data science club, read extra R books to learn and practice more skills, and most of all, NETWORK.  \n\nGet to know your classmates.  Meet and connect with your professors.  Get involved on campus if you can.  Reach out and form study groups or even attend conferences (such as the Women in Data Science conference) where you can learn from and engage with statisticians and data science professionals all across the globe.  \n\nI understand that school work can take some time out of your life, but it really helps to learn on your own and network.  It's the other part of the equation for success in college besides getting grades and learning the material.",

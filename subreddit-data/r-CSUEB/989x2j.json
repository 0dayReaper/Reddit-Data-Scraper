    "postText": "Hi guys, I have a dumb question.\n\nI had 4 classes up until today. I have 5 now because I was moved from the waitlist, into enrollment. I'm planning on dropping a class but I don't know if it'll affect any of the payments I've done. I paid tuition last month, didn't get financial aid, just a CA Grant. I'm waiting on being reimbursed this week. \n\nIf I drop one of my classes, will I lose money? I'm thinking I won't since I've technically paid for 4 classes and I'm just replacing the class with another... Sorry. I'm a new transfer and I honestly have no clue what I'm doing. \n\nThank you to any answers to my dumb question!",

            "comment": "I think you should be okay as long as the four classes you have remaining qualify as a full load (12 plus units). You only run the risk of losing some financial aid/grant money if you aren\u2019t enrolled in enough units to be considered a full time student. I\u2019m not sure if you can even enroll in five classes atm because you need special permission if you want to take more than 17 units. We still have a day left so try to check in with someone from the school to be completely safe.",

Giantbubble was right when he said that you just need 12 units to be considered full time. Here\u2019s the email I got on my Horizon account:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/a0SgXlI",

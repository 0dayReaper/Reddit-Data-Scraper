You better believe that when the next recession hits they are gonna raise tuition again. And do you really think them hiding this fund from the public and the fact that tuition has doubled since the 08 collapse aren't related? That's why they hid this shit from us.",

                    "comment": "Why would I believe something that hasn't happened? The cost of almost everything has risen in the past 10 years, not just tuition. You can debate cause and effect but do you expect the salaries and costs to be the same as back in 2008? Cost of housing/rent has more than doubled. Wages have been raised, cost of healthcare, replacing old buildings that are not earthquake compliant, new parking structures/housing for new students, etc. And it's not just executive salaries that have to be paid by academics, operations, and other necessary staff that keeps the campuses going. I am not someone who thinks money should go straight to execs but it's naive to think salaries of the working class isn't going to go up or be paid over time.   \n\nThey raised tuition back then because the CSU system and California as a whole were pretty much suffering because no one really had a rainy day fund. Now the California budget has a surplus and same with CSU.   \n\nOn the same matter, how does an organization \"hide\" 1.5 billion dollars? That is a material amount that anyone would notice not being reported. Also what is the accumulation between years? Was it a small amount before and only recently reached this amount in the last 3 years or something? Was it truly hidden or were people just not aware from their financial statements that are publicly released and audited by a 3rd party accounting firm. There are a lot of questions before jumping to an instant conclusion that the CSU system has done something drastically wrong.",

It's not something that was missed but rather something that was hidden. Keep making excuses for the people screwing you though. That's what all the good little bootlickers do.",

It is unfortunately just what the market dictates. Right now in most articles, all I see are statements between the auditors and CSU without much substantial proof from either side. It's ignorant to immediately think articles with hit piece headlines are factual just because of your bias.   \n\nLike I asked, how does an organization just \"hide\" 1.5 billion dollars? The only reason I can think of is it didn't immediately pop up as those are a combination of certain numbers and no one who understands financials could tell.  \n\nMy position is only that there's not enough information to actually determine what the CSU did was wrong.",

            "comment": "I actually think this story is overblown. I thought I paid a fair amount in tuition and like the CSU said, these funds are like a rainy day funds. I think of running any organization like your personal finance where it's important to have an emergency fund in case revenues/funds are off for a year or two. Seems like the only issue is whether the CSU had disclosed those funds in certain reporting requirements which seems fair. But it's not like the funds are going to executive and bloated staff salaries. Like the report said, it's just in reserves for now.   \n\nThe way government funding works is if the head sees a little surplus, they think the department will be okay next year if they took away those extra funds so many government departments usually spend EXTRA to make it look like they spent everything despite it not being necessary. Doesn't seem like the case here as CSU is saving these funds for when there comes a recession or something. \n\nAs for the rise in tuition, well it's doubled in 10 years time. While not fun, it's also not surprising considering the amount of students enrolling now compared to before and inflation.",

Ten grand a year for a state college is pretty absurd in my point of view. I'm fine with taching it to inflation, 3% or so per year. That would take over 23 years accounting for compound interest.",

Depends what the market is but I wouldn't compare consumer goods market to a university.   \n\nThe CSU serves a huge amount of population but college tuition across the country has pretty much doubled their prices in a 10 year span if not more.   \n\nI mean, look at housing in California. In 2009, average home prices were around 330k and it's risen to an average of 549k. It's probably tripled in value in the bay area.",

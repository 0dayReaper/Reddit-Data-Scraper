            "comment": "You have to ask yourself alot of questions to decide, and understand what is a priority for you when thinking of college. \n\nAre you dorming? If you are, then SJSU by a mile. The dorm life at SJSU is just way more lively and there is more stuff to do in San Jose compared to Hayward. If you are commuting, then whichever is closer tbh. East bay is a comuter school, meaning most people there are reserved and want to get home asap. \n\nI love East Bay because of how understated and lowkey it is. It's a smaller school, but in a way that makes it so that you have a closer connection to other students and professors. It makes me feel more concentrated and have less distractions. In terms of academics, both should be pretty much equal. \n\nNo matter where you choose to go, you won't make a wrong choice! They're both good options and you'll meet great people at both. You can still have lots of fun at East Bay and be successful. The school dosent make the person, if you're driven enough, you'll be successful anywhere!",

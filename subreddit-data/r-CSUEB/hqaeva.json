    "postText": "I'm just finding out that professor Hubbard was kicked out of the college for making an offensive statement. I was planning to take him for the upcoming semester cause I heard he was a chill guy. I wonder who is going to replace him. I really hope it's a good teacher and not a random curriculum nazi. If you have any information on the replacement or updates on if he'll be allowed back please let me know.",

As it is the most diverse school in the country. Any news like that especially during this time only hurts the college. I can't imagine the freshman enrolling this year would be too excited to go to a school where a proffesor like Hubbard works. The enrollment is going to be way lower.",

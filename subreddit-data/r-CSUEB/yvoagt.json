    "postText": "Hello r/CSUEB,\n\nI'm planning to transfer to Cal State East Bay from a community college, such as Diablo Valley College. Also, I'm majoring in computer science and planning to minor in math. When I check the math courses at Cal State East Bay online, I notice two linear algebra courses. One is MATH 215, an introduction to Linear Algebra, and the other is MATH 225, which is numerical algorithms and linear algebra for computer science. Also, MATH 285, which I did not take, is the Introduction to Differential Equations. My guess is that taking CS411 requires MATH225 and CS211. I know I took discrete math at DVC known as MATH195, which is the equivalent of CS211. I'm not sure if MATH215 and MATH285 are the same as MATH225. Should MATH215 and MATH285 be the prerequisite for CS411? Should I take both MATH225 and MATH215/285?",

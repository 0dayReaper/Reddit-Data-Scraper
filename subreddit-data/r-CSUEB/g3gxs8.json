I don\u2019t know what to do like what I should do and stuff.\nAlso if the transfer does plan out the way I want it to then I wanna continue at eb. I\u2019m a first year, soon to be second. I\u2019m majoring in Business Adminstration. So I wanna transfer after my second year. Any help :)",

I felt East Bay was far from that; everyone just goes to class in the morning and and leaves class, with hardly any interaction. There are no extremely rich kids or prodigies here (at least nothing East Bay would like to show everyone). There is no sense of community \ud83d\ude14. \n\nWhen I saw the things you had to do to transfer it just made no sense to push that hard and lose money. I stuck with East Bay but I can't say I'm happy with my decision or mad at myself. I'm kind of neutral.",

I\u2019ve always and still interested in going to a school my choice. I was pretty forced to go here cause of my parents lol",

Your chances will be much better at cc. CSUEB isn't exactly a difficult school to get into so I think you can still transfer to CSUEB in 2 years if you decide to continue.",

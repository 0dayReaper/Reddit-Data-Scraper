I see the women's swim team but no swim club or Men's team? Is there a way I can do semi competitive swimming here as a man?",

I believe they are still active but you might want to contact the coach just to verify the info. I haven't swam with them but if they are like most Masters clubs on college campuses, it won't be an exclusively student thing but a mix of students, faculty, and staff.",

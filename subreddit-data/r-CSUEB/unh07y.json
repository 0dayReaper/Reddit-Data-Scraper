I was a bit confused because, like you, I heard they try to accept everyone qualified that doesn\u2019t have any major red flags in the application. Since it\u2019s online, I\u2019m hoping some people applied thinking COVID would still be a major factor, and, with COVID out of the way, hopefully some people will no longer want to do online school. Additionally, hopefully there are lots of people who applied multiple places and will take other offers.\n\nWish they would\u2019ve told us how many people got accepted and how many of us got waitlisted, but, oh well. Gotta wait until next Friday to hear more.",

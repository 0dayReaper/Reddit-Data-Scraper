    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm planning to apply to the Industrial Engr program for Fall 2020 as a transfer student and was wondering what the program is like? How are the classes, professors, department etc? How are the job prospects, and your experience overall? Not sure where else to ask/look for the program, so if anyone could help me out, it would be highly appreciated! :) Thanks!\n\nI'm also looking into applying for the Computer Engineering program, so if anyone has an opinion on if that is any better, or whether I should choose one over the other, please let me know!",

Other than that the rest of the staff in that field is great. Motavalli will be your advisor and he\u2019s super nice and helpful just don\u2019t BS him. Dr. Bowen is a super interest character.",

IMHO I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a good teacher and you\u2019ll be scared to go to class must of the time, if you join, be ready to try to be her friend, even she\u2019s around in her late 50s. I think I heard she might be taking a break, but idk how true that is. I\u2019m doing the IE program and I like it tho. Let me know if you have any questions.",

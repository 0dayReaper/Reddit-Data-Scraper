I'm taking another of his courses in the Fall. He does a solid job teaching and tries to keep the class engaged. My only complaint is that the Software Engineering course has a group project and obviously your success is very much tied to the motivations\n\nI took Hecker for Web Development and I found the class was okayish.\n\nI took Raupach for Programming Language Concepts and the class was honestly extremely dry but I definitely learnt a thing or 2 from it. \n\nI took Ruan for Computer Architecture was an okay class.",

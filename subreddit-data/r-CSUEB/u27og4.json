You\u2019re a sociology major so I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have any problems getting into the classes you\u2019ll need unlike SF state cause I\u2019m a Bio major and I heard getting into the science classes are hard. East Bay doesn\u2019t have that problem as much so being one on one with your professors is a plus. But it\u2019s all up to you in the end don\u2019t feel like you made a bad decision if you chose one over the other this YOUR education. Congrats on getting in to both colleges",

If you're more about the school life and like it's super important to you, SF would probably have a better life there than east bay. East bay is a commuter school so people are just in and out. But I'm sure you can stillake connections with both classmates and other event's",

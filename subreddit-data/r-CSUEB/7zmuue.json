Don\u2019t worry if you haven\u2019t received anything yet though, acceptances are rolling until April 1st. Also we\u2019re local, so that may play a part in receiving our acceptance so early. East Bay is the only CSU I\u2019ve heard from so far. I would be an upcoming freshman. Are you a freshman or a transfer? Transfer students might get their acceptances at a different time",

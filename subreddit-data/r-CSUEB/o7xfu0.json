Would anybody happen to know where most of the classes for this program are held so I can visit those halls? \n\nAlso, I\u2019d appreciate any other info on how the overall experience is here :) How are the professors? How\u2019s grad student life? Would you recommend this school?\n\nThanks so much!",

    "postText": "Hello all at EB! I\u2019m currently a Hayward local graduating from a CC in december and was wondering, is their truly no campus life here? I really wanna go here but all I see on forums is how hard it is making friends even on while living on campus. I know school isn\u2019t about partying but not being able to make connections with other students is never good.",

I myself lived about 20 minutes away and had a part-time job in Walnut Creek while I was a student there. Commuter school for sure",

People here really just come to classes and dip out considering that there isn\u2019t much to do on campus anyways and the fact that it is a commuter school. You could perhaps join clubs? But from what I\u2019ve seen, it isn\u2019t exactly as \u201ctight-knit\u201d or active as one would think. If you\u2019re looking for liveliness or school with action then I would just look elsewhere ngl. However, if you\u2019re just looking for a school to do 4 years and get a degree then the school ain\u2019t too bad.",

I tried a couple clubs but everything is so infrequent that they\u2019re not fulfilling. Or the meetings are when I work. I have met a couple people in classes and on the discord and they seem pretty cool. \n\nI will say people in my major have been the easiest to form \u201cbonds\u201d amongst. We all have the same goal and a common interest so conversations flow a bit more easily lol.",

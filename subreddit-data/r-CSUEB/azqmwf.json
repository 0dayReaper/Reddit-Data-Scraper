Just do a workshop first to get a better idea of what to expect.\n\nThough I only did the first day of the 2-day workshop, it was super helpful... and passed on my first go. I\u2019m a nontraditional student and hadn\u2019t taken an English/writing class since (somewhere before) 2010, so it was definitely work.\n\nThe keys to the WST are to organize your thoughts (take 5-10 minutes to draft an outline) and pick a side in the argument. Being firm with your choice was one of the big focuses at the workshop... it shows confidence. Don\u2019t write about how both sides are agreeable because then you seem indecisive; also, don\u2019t spend your most of your essay on one side and then write a single sentence agreeing with part of the other side. It also reads as though you don\u2019t have a clear direction with your topic. \n\nOf course there are other things (like spelling, grammar, and correct uses of phrases) that will help. A few errors aren\u2019t detrimental to your score. They want to see how you organize your thoughts, think linearly and confidently, and manage your time.\n\nYou got this.",

I assume these are more difficult than Engl 100.\n\nFrom my experience in these classes, they were much more rigorous than normal English classes. We had assignments due each week and 3-ish essay like assignments that went into our portfolio to be examined.",

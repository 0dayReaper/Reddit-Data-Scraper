    "postText": "I'm a freshly transferred student here, and so far, I haven't been able to make any new friends at this school. I'm not living on campus, so that may make things more difficult. I do want to go beyond just earning a bachelor's degree and go at this place because ultimately, it's what about college, isn't it?  \n\n\nWhat would y'all suggest to make new friends here if you were me? I'm not really into drinking/frat clubs, but I consider myself quite a conversational person.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s common here for people to keep to themselves since it\u2019s considered a commuter school, but the best way on campus is to join clubs and attend events on campus. There are lots of clubs on camps related to your major where you can meet and socialize with people in your major. Check out Baysync for events that other clubs and organizations are holding. Most of my fiends on campus I\u2019ve meet through my classes, however, so don\u2019t be afraid to be social in class. And while I\u2019m not part of a Greek club, I think there may be a couple that don\u2019t party/drink but just socialize, so it\u2019s also definitely an option to meet people. \n\nEveryone on campus is in the same boat as you, feeling it\u2019s hard to make friends on campus. So don\u2019t be afraid to break the ice! Most people on campus are really nice and easy going!",

I meet a classmate on my first day coincidently we were looking for the same class. Ever since then we link up and work on our essays together, but yes it\u2019s definitely a commuter school. I say join an organization they have plenty to choose from.",

I just applied at East Bay today (March 1) as I realized they were still accepting applications. \n\nI applied for undeclared- interest in nursing\n\nI am just wondering when people got their admission decisions? When should I expect mine? \n\nAnd if you were accepted what was your GPA? Mine is a 3.46.... will I get in?",

                    "comment": "I'll be completely honest with you. It's a commuter school. Student life on campus is lacking. A huge portion of students only go there to take classes and go home. I'm sure the experience would be different if you dorm, but there still won't be much in comparison to other schools. Nevertheless, there are great people everywhere.\n\nIf you're interested in pursuing a nursing degree, CSUEB is a great school for that and you'll meet many like-minded individuals with the same goals.\n\nI'm at a point where I'm okay with missing out on the fun and just doing what I have to do to get a degree, so CSUEB is fine with me. However, if you value campus life, this is something you might want to be aware of.",

            "comment": "Decisions on acceptance are usually pretty quick. I can\u2019t really give you a time but since it\u2019s a Cal school as long as you pass the GPA requirement (2.7) if you are transferring it should be accepted. As far as making friends there a couple unofficial discord\u2019s you can join. A number of fraternity\u2019s on campus. However wanting to make lots of friends will\nBe a challenge because of how online learning is still going on so there\u2019s no real way to meet people unless you make the effort to\nJoin orgs and or zoom events. However rumor has it we could be back on campus in the fall. But either way you can definitely make friends but keep in mind the commuter school thing is very much real. Most students are dedicated which is good for group projects but also means a percentage of students do not otherwise partake in activities at school because of having other priorities (older students who have full time jobs or families) however if you are younger lots of younger students used to (some still do) dorm at CSUEB and otherwise are involved with orgs and clubs and activities on campus. Any and all orgs including fraternity\u2019s and events have all pretty much have moved to zoom so expect a lot of that. However as mentioned if you have a higher GPA and really want more of the social aspect your best bet might be to apply to another university. But keep in mind most other universities like SJSU require a higher GPA and also probably have more requirements and take longer to send acceptance letters, as my last semester as a junior, I truly appreciate how accessible CSUEB has been for me. I\u2019ve had some really amazing teachers but also some really bad. My fraternity has also helped with the social aspect. Wish you the best of luck in your decision",

I submitted my application by the March 2 as well, so I'm waiting to hear back. I'm anxious about this since it's my only realistic option for university at this point.\n\nYour GPA looks excellent, so I don't think it'll be a problem. As long as you finished the main GE classes, you should have a good shot.",

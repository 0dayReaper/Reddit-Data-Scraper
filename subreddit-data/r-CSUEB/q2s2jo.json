As someone else said, Handshake shares opportunities based on your profile: interest/field of education (not school)/your past job experience and your geographical location. If you want to get more Facebook/Google job suggestions you will need to align your online Handshake profile to fit the requirements of the jobs that FB and Google are looking to fill. I have received alert for Facebook/Microsoft/Google, etc. Update your Handshake profile and you should see a change over time.",

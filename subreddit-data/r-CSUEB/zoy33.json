Right now, we are working with two schools in Oakland (Life Academy and Elmhurst Middle School) and one in Union City (James Logan High School).\n\nCheck out the subreddit for the group and message me if interested in working with any of the schools and/or registering yourself/coworkers to be a part of the Emerging Leaders program:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/UWBA_EL/\n",

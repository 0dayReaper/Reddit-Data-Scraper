    "postText": "It says on here I got a $645 scholarship. I already paid all my tuition fees for this semester. Where will the money go, and can I send it to my direct deposit?  \n\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/Irk1H7Q.png](https://i.imgur.com/Irk1H7Q.png)  \n\n\nAlso I got an email in July saying I would get $800 but then I didn't get the 2nd email about the consent...pretty sure I won't get HEERF because I didn't apply for it, but pretty messed up for them to email me 2 months ago saying I should expect something on Aug. 10. Not a big deal though cause I wasn't expecting to actually get anything. Anyone else constantly experience shit like this at this school?",

If you have a balance left on your account after other financial aid posting then you will get the remaining balance after paying school balance by check or direct deposit. If your financial aid covered everything then you will get the full amount given too you via check or direct deposit.\n\n800 amount you will get paid by check or direct  deposit (today was the ESTIMATED date it will come but it might be longer) if you sign the consent they have, that means they will use it for whatever balance you have for school. If you don\u2019t sign the consent you will get it by check or direct deposit soon",

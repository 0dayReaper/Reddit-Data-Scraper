If I could see the test to review the answers I got wrong. He said no. That doesn\u2019t sound right. I can\u2019t see a test I took for a class I paid for? Anyone had this problem?",

Wouldn\u2019t even allow me to do a hw assignment that I couldn\u2019t do bc I was not in the class yet do to admissions problems. He just won\u2019t let me see my results",

I\u2019m really excited to conduct this research because there isn\u2019t academic research on QPOC astrology. Unfortunately, my school doesn\u2019t give us funding for this so the study is unpaid. If that isn\u2019t a deterrent, please read the info below if you\u2019re interested in participating. I appreciate any and all interest!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Are you a queer person of color who uses astrology?**\n\nMy name is Diana and I\u2019m completing my senior capstone research project in Sociology at CSU East Bay. My research will be investigating how queer people of color (Black, Indigenous, and other people of color) use astrology to enter and navigate romantic relationships.\n\nTo participate, you must:\n\n1. Identify as a queer person of color,\n\n2. Believe in and regularly use astrology,\n\n3. Live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and\n\n4. Be between the ages of 21 and 35.\n\nIf interested in participating, please fill out this eligibility screening survey by **Wednesday, February 24, 2021**. The screening survey should take approximately 5 minutes to complete.\n\n[https://forms.gle/A35yc9z4nik8cgGK6](https://forms.gle/A35yc9z4nik8cgGK6)\n\nIf selected as a participant for this study, you will be asked to participate in one group interview over Zoom, in which you will be asked to discuss your romantic and spiritual experiences, and an individual follow-up interview (if needed). Your participation is entirely voluntary and would take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours.\n\nIf you have any questions, please email me at dhernandez132@horizon.csueastbay.edu or my research advisor, Amara Miller at [amara.miller@csueastbay.edu](mailto:amara.miller@csueastbay.edu).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pcf252lu0dj61.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f0f0b8e5cb9ed9f6c701fac9d0b8e733f23b6678",

You\u2019re not the teacher of record, but you get a stipend and you\u2019re in the mentor teacher\u2019s classroom all year half time. You\u2019re then required to work 3 years in the district or you have to pay it back. The amount you pay varies on how long you\u2019ve worked. Comment or message me if you\u2019re interested. They\u2019re still looking for applicants.",

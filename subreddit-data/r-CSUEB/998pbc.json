    "postText": "Hi all, so I know financial aid would deduct some money to go towards tuition fees. The federal pell grant was taken to pay for tuition fees (\\~$3,000) on August 17th. So I had \\~$450 left to pay for tuition fees. August 20th was coming up and I was nervous so I paid the 450 using my money, but now I'm missing 450 from my grants that were disbursed after August 20th... Will this fix itself and reimburse me back the extra 450 I was supposed to receive from my grants? \n\nTLDR: I got impatient and paid the remaining $450 for tuition fees with my own money, Financial Aid did not account for that and I'm missing 450 from the grants (they applied 3450 to pay for tuition fees).",

And my cal grant of $2871 got released yesterday and it says it went to tuition fees even though I didn\u2019t have any outstanding tuition fees. I did  not get refunded back to me via direct deposit I\u2019m waiting to see if I get the cal grant reimbursed to me. \n\nAnd i can\u2019t get anyone in the financial aid department on the phone. ",

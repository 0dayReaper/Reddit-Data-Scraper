    "postText": "Transferring this Spring. Plan to be on Hayward campus all day Monday-Thursday. I reside in Concord. \n\nI can't make up my mind rather I should drive or take the BART &amp; Shuttle combo. On one hand bad drivers and traffic causes me so much angst, but on the other hand so do meth heads, other sketchy characters, and the occasional train delay.\n\nAny input is much appreciated!! :-)",

            "comment": "If the cost factors (BART vs Driving) aren\u2019t an issue then my suggestion is to do both for one week each. \n\nSee if you have issues with the hours of the shuttle/BART or with traffic. Get a real feel for the commute each way. 2 weeks out of 16 isn\u2019t too strenuous to test but if that\u2019s bad then maybe one day of each and then go from what felt better. \n\nIf cost is a factor just remember driving has gas, wear and tear, and parking permit fees. \nThe BART has the ticket fees. We have a free shuttle from campus to the station but also remember that you may have to take a city bus if you miss the shuttle or if service is down. \n\nGood luck OP!",

Thanks!\n\nSaving money is always a positive considering my financial situation, but right now #1 priority is efficiency and stress. We will see.",

            "comment": "As someone who takes the BART, I say if you will be on campus when gets dark then I suggest driving instead. In the evening the shuttle only comes in 30 minute intervals and then 1 hour intervals as the night goes on. Waiting at the Hayward Bart station when its dark doesn't feel safe because as you mentioned, there are people who hang around who are unpredictable and confrontational. If that's not the case and you'll be leaving campus before it gets dark, then BART is more worth it. Good luck OP and congrats on transferring to EB.",

I'll have to figure out when shuttle times change (and also BART times, I know they decrease after a certain point too). \n\nBut yes i'm excited to start! Thanks for the advice/info and kind words.",

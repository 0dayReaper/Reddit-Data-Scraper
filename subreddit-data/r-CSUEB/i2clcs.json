I'm also a photographer, and I travel a lot for work. In 2018 I did my finals from Taiwan, South Korea, and Mongolia. My professors all knew I was traveling for work during the time, and they all loved it as long as I did all my work. They felt that my experiences actually added to the class. But I'm also an anthropology major, so spending time in other cultures is something anthropologists tend to be pretty okay with.",

Many students are distance learning from way outside of the Bay Area. Having one class suddenly insist on attendance - park, beach, doesn\u2019t matter - would be a total fail.",

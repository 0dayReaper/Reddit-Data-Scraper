    "postText": "I was wondering if anybody might have any information on what a recent successful applicant profile for the School Psychology masters program looks like? I'm hoping to apply next year and have been working very hard to get high marks in the pre-requisite courses. I've also been working with children and volunteering at a lab. However my undergraduate GPA is quite poor (2.56), especially in the first two years.  If you only look at my last two years though its ~3.22. If you could provide any information on what GPA, GRE scores and extra stuff you had and was successfully admitted, I would greatly appreciate it! Any tips and pointers on the whole application process would be much appreciated as well :). Thanks in advance! ",

My undergraduate GPA was 2.6-2.8 depending on how you measured it (transfer), I sent in my GRE scores but they weren't required, and I completed the CBEST, which will be a requirement to eventually graduate. Sorry if this wasn't relevant to your interests! ",

I would very much like to attend in the East Bay area because I have personal ties there, also I really like the CS-East Bay School Psychology program, so it's my top choice. Tuition is also a concern which is why I'd like to go to a state school. Thanks for your input regardless :) I appreciate it. ",

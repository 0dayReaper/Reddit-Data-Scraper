I've got my tuition covered but housing at the dorms is way too expensive.(I believe it's $15,000 a semester, please correct me) so what are some good city's to find a room/roommate to commute. Website? People you know? Or even if you yourself want to dorm? ",

FB too, if you know people in the area just ask around for any openings. But otherwise I hear Union City has reasonable deals but it's a bit of a commute. I'd give a ballpark range on rent from 600-1,200, both being extremes.",

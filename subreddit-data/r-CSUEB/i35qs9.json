    "postText": "Hello all!\n\nHas anyone been in the MBA program at CSUEB and could provide their own experience in the program? \n\nI am possibly planning to get an MBA to career pivot as well as give me an edge with the tough job market as well as expand my knowledge.  Some questions I have are below:\n\n1. What are the reasons why you chose this MBA program?\n2. Why were/are you planning on pursuing your MBA?\n3. What is/was the teaching style like?\n4. How did classes compare to your undergrad courses?\n5. How was the networking among the cohort?\n\nThanks!",

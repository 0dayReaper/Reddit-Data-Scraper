I was kinda surprised at the effort when I transfers.\n\nYou could intern during the quarter but it might be hard (cus travel and all) to do both effectively. However there are internship/research opportunities on campus during the quarter that wouldn't be so intensive.\n\nI've never been to the career center, but I imagine it's a good place to start",

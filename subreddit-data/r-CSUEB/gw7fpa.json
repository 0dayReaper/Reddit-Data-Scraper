Our lives have drastically changed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but amidst this uncertainty, we face a crucial point in history. We are faced with recurring tragedies in the form of the recent murders of George Floyd in Minnesota, Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, which have left us in anguish. As a community enriched with diversity and knowledge, we recognize that these troubling events are not arbitrary, rather they are a culmination of many years of targeting individuals based on their race. The recent protests serve as a strong example of frustration for the injustices and discrimination that continue to prevail in our country.\n\nDuring these difficult times, California State University, East Bay\u2019s Associated Students, Incorporated (ASI) upholds its mission to advocate for our diverse student population in order to make sound decisions for the betterment of the students. It is especially during these times where we must voice our solidarity to safely serve our campus community and share our thoughts.\n\nIt is ASI\u2019s intention to serve our students in their times of need, especially those who are strongly affected by systemic racism. We condemn racism in every aspect and we stand with you as you use your voice in protest. As an institution that takes pride in diversity, we will not be silent to the injustices occurring. \n\nTo our students, faculty, and staff; we hear you. We stand with you. Black Lives Matter. We recognize that we must do more to respond to the injustices happening all around the country. We must demand justice, we must fight anti-blackness, and we must practice anti-racism. We are also calling on all of you to help us understand how we can help support you through this time.\n\nAs fellow students, we understand what a tremendous toll these times can take on each of us. We are sharing with you a list of resources that can possibly help lessen the burden of today\u2019s pain and provide you with tools to continue your allyship to support our community in the Bay Area. \n\nStay informed. Visit KRON4 for Bay Area news. Hayward has imposed an 8PM to 5AM curfew in response to vandalism, looting and violence \n\nKnow your rights. Prepare and plan to protest safely considering social distancing suggestions \n\nSign a petition, send a donation, and share resources that support seeking justice for the movement\n\nSchedule an appointment with a mental health professional. Your feelings are valid. Change making is an emotional investment \n\nPractice Self Care: Experiencing and seeing discrimination over social media can be overwhelming. Meditate, take phone breaks, hydrate\n\nReach out. Call 1-800-309-2131 for Crisis support Services of Alameda County, CA. or Text SHARE to 741741 for confidential crisis counseling \n\nWe hope that, as a diverse community, we can come together, provide support, and end the systemic racism corrupting our country. We, too, are feeling pain and anger like so many across the nation. We need change. ASI is committed to becoming stronger allies and fighting for social justice. We must consistently educate ourselves on racism and encourage our peers to do the same. We must be active in our participation against discrimination, and we must do what we can to show that racism and oppression of individuals no longer has a place in our country. It is on us to make the change that we wish to see in the world. \n\nIn solidarity, \n\nThe Associated Students, Inc. of California State University, East Bay\n\nEuridice Pamela Sanchez, President/CEO\n\nHoang Dao, Executive Vice President \n\nBrittney Golez, Vice President of Communications\n\nOmer Shakoor, Vice President of Finance\n\nAnjelica de Leon, Vice President of University Affairs\n\nJessica Iheaso, Director of Legislative Affairs\n\nZaira Perez, Director of Programming\n\nNicholas Brandao, Director of Wellness\n\nKea Kaholoaa, Director of Sustainability\n\nArianna Miralles, Director of Concord\n\nDaniel Olguin, Senator of CBE\n\nMyKale Clark, Senator of CLASS \n\nTyler Enquist, Senator of CEAS \n\nMirna Maamou, Senator of Science\u201d",

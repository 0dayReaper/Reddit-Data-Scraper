    "postText": "Edit: Hi everyone. I have not had a chance to log in until now (about a day after my post). Four people reached out to me (including the commenters) so I think that I will definitely have the help that I need. I am so grateful for that. \n\nIt feels like the best thing is for me to do is respond to coordinate with each person who has reached out in the order that they've messaged/commented to check-in about the details, their schedule or how much they would like to work, and to see if we are on the same page. I will see if the tasks I have to tackle are things that the first person would like to do, and if not, I can reach out to the second person, and so on. \n\nIt could be that some tasks are not as appealing to one person, and if they would like to do some things but pass on others then I can ask the second/third/fourth person if they would want to fill in that gap. Or maybe with class schedules combined with what I'll need to accomplish in the coming days, two people will want to stop by to work on things at different times (or all of us together as a group).\n\nI will leave this post up a bit longer while I reach out to everyone so that they can reference it. I am going to need a lot of help in the coming weeks! Thank you to everyone in this community for coming through for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a 30/f grad student at UCSC but I live with my parents about 1 block away from CSUEB (Hayward Blvd. by university market). My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer about a month ago. As you can imagine, things have been hard. At this point I need help to catch up on things being neglected.\n\nDoes anyone want a job where we do random stuff for 2-3 hours at a time when it is convenient and I will pay you $15/hr?\n\nWe could collaborate on what we feel like doing on any given day. It would be about 2-3 weeks of stopping by and us doing the tasks together. As I said, I live super close to campus (5 minute walk from the top parking lot) so I thought this might be a win-win situation where someone cool/positive needs something to do between/before/after classes for a couple weeks.\n\nFor the cleaning/chores part, it would be tackling one room at at time and not a whole-house thing. We could put on music/movie/podcast so it wouldn't be miserable.\n\nSome jobs are bigger, for example the kitchen is dirty. Not everyday messy, but 2 hours of deep-cleaning dirty. Like the pantry needs to be cleaned out, cabinets need to be really wiped down, microwave deep cleaned, tile counters/floor steam cleaned, etc.\n\nSome jobs are smaller, like one of the living rooms needs to be deeply dusted so there are no allergies, windows washed, light bulbs changed (the ceiling is really high so it is hard for me to do it alone). That room would be a 1 hour job and there are a couple rooms that would be the same.\n\nThen I also need help with random stuff like giving my doggies haircuts (going to the groomers stresses them out). I have clippers and usually do it myself but it helps so much if someone holds them (or I can hold them, you clip). That would probably be 1.5 hours.\n\nThere wouldn't need to be a set time or day, it's all really flexible on basically whenever you feel like meeting up for a couple hours. You could stay for longer or shorter.  I don't want to tell my parents that I am paying/hiring someone because they would probably feel guilty. It would basically be a \"hey my friend \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ is swooping by, we're going to give the dogs a bath\" versus an actual job with a boss situation.\n\nI'm not sure if I did the greatest job explaining so feel free to ask questions or send me a DM.",

Probably would've graduated on time if I didn't retake some classes where I got a W or a D.   \n\nMy suggestion is to go see your major advisor and visit the AACE building to see what GEs you still need to take. For College of Business and Economics, they actually have all the class schedules for the remainder of the year, although it's not known who's teaching which class so you can plan which classes you might be interested in next quarter.

Is it best to live in dorm or get an apartment with others or ?? \n\nNot quite sure what happens out there or if this is a step I want to take because one is far from \"home\" and it is a new environment. Also, I enjoy my major how are the classes? Anyone a psychology major?\n\nAnything helps. Pros and cons?",

            "comment": "East Bay is a commuter school. So if you want an active/ traditional college social life, I highly suggest you join a sorority or fraternity and live on campus. They are very close knit and do a lot activities! \n\nYou should also know a huuuuge part of East Bay students are transfers as well. So a lot of people can relate to being new even if you\u2019re a junior. EB does also a really good job in getting transfer students acclimated and making sure you\u2019re on track to graduate. I finished in 2 years no problem when I transferred. I was also always able to get a counselor appointments in a timely manner as well.\n\nClasses are also fairly easy to get into (ie not impacted), and unlike many CSU\u2019s you can change your major or add a 2nd major if you like even as a transfer student! \n\nI was in the business department which is well known for the area, but I\u2019ve heard good things about the psychology department as well. My friend is getting her BA in that and so far she\u2019s really enjoying the program! You should also note that there\u2019s a club called THRIVE which a positive psychology club on campus. They focus on putting on campus events and talking about psych related topics. That might be up your alley.\n\nLike a lot of colleges, you get out of it what you put into it. If you join some clubs, talk to the students in your classes, and perhaps even join a sorority/frat \u2014 you\u2019ll make life long friends and have many fond memories. You\u2019ll also of course get a quality education!\n\nMy advice to you is take a trip out to Hayward and tour the campus. See what the dorms are like. Wander through some of halls and classrooms. Grab lunch and see what you think of the food. (IMHO, the food trucks on campus are bomb.) You don\u2019t really know what it\u2019s like until you\u2019re there, so take a trip when you can.\n\nAnyways, best of luck to you! (\u2018:",

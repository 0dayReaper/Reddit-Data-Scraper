    "postText": "Hi guys, I recently started to decide on Universities to transfer to from CC for CS and East Bay is one of my choices between it, CSU:MB, and UC Merced. I know these aren't the biggest named schools for CS, but I want to know how it is like at this school. I have a few UC's that haven't released decisions and some on waitlists, but I am thinking more towards East Bay.  \n\n\nIs CS pretty good and also more importantly, do people frequently go to this school where I can try and put my name out there for internships, connections, networking, jobs, etc? I want to more so balance focus on completing my major and getting a foot in to start my career in CS because CS comes easy to me so I don't want to spend too much time studying and not enough time connecting. I've done a lot of prereq too like finishing all of Calc and finishing Lin. Algebra and Diff. Equations as well as a year of physics. So I am also wondering if I will be able to graduate in 2 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

The ones who worked at it all received jobs over 6 figs right out of college in the last year. but those were kinda few and far between. Most I know have jobs that started around 75k. Having EB not super well known kind of hurts getting the initial interview, but it's not an instant disqualification.",

Do you happen to know if they ever reached out during their time at CSUEB to any companies like recruiters or job fairs, etc? I know my main goal at a less than known school is going to be reaching out and making myself known. That's good to know the CS program isn't that bad though. Thank you for your info!",

It doesn\u2019t separate the competition from people who have CS degrees that are applying for the same job. Experience (e.g Internships, jobs) and skills with along with a CS degree may matter more.",

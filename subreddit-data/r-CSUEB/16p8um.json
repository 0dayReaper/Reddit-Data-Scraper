    "postText": "Hey guys\nQuick question for all you CS majors. I work full time in Santa Clara but I live in San Ramon. Im thinking about going to east bay to get my BS in CS. I was wondering if one can finish this degree while still working fulltime. In other words, do they offer classes after 6:30pm? I only work 3-4 days a week so I do have some open days during the week. So those once a week, 3hr classes would work perfectly for me. I cant afford to quit my job. This job is the sole reason im going back to school to study CS. Thanks guys!",

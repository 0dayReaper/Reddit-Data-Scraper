If you\u2019re able, I would honestly recommend getting your money\u2019s worth. It\u2019s criminal how expensive a CSU is and it\u2019s worse for a UC. The same general Ed class at a junior college is almost nothing compared to the one at CSU. I took a general Ed class needed to graduate at a junior college at it was ONLY 100+ dollars for 3 units. Compared to the 2000+ it costs for the CSU.",

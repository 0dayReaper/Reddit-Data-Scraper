    "postText": "I missed all last week because of the fires.  I live in the North Bay and just a few miles from the Atlas fire.  Not only was I suffering from asthma attacks from the smoke and had to lock myself in my apartment for a week, my parents had to be evacuated and just learned yesterday they lost the house. I emailed one of my professors explaining the situation.  She still gives me points off for absences and a failing grade on my quiz.\n\nProbably nothing I can do.  This is my first quarter here at csueb as a transfer and so far my experience here has not been stellar. :(",

They've been sending emails about how students should be careful with their health (that's just for us away from the fire and just dealing with the air quality) so there's no excuse for your prof being an asshole towards someone that's been more directly affected by the fire. Get some documentation for your asthma and perhaps for your parents house as well, and screenshot/save the messages (or lack of any) between you and your prof. Hope things work out for you and your family man",

Employees have to usually use their own vacation time to receive pay the week that the campus is closed. However, by moving the holiday to the end of the year, the employees can get a paid day without using their vacation day. Cause heaven forbid giving their employees a paid day off for a national holiday AND the holiday break. ",

That would be like saying your spring break is only one day off and the other days you get off for that week are including 4th July, Memorial Day, ect. What\u2019s the point of holidays if you\u2019re going to celebrate them on random days?\n\nThanks for the link though! I understand that the quarter system is on a tighter schedule thus we can\u2019t always get the same days off traditional schools do. So in a way it kind of makes sense even though it\u2019s a federal holiday. ",

The point is Black Friday isn't a holiday but people go out of town for Thanksgiving more than on President's Day. I think its worth it to have an extra couple days off at Thanksgiving and Christmas time and am glad the CSU system gives the extra time there.",

I\u2019m used to semester system I guess where it\u2019s a given that you have those 3 days off for Thanksgiving, and that your spring break is 5 days off, ect.  It\u2019s just the trade off for only having 10 weeks of school per quarter though. Thanks for the insight. I\u2019m not as salty as before lol. ",

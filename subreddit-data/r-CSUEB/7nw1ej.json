Fair enough but wow what a compassionate school.  The is the second time a professor was an asshole. The other time was last quarter; I got a failing grade on a quiz for missing because of the North Bay fires. My parents lost their house.\n\nI regret going here; I wish I hadn't transferred out of Sac State.  The only reason why I transferred was because of proximity.   Open class is on T/R which I have to work.  ",

I understand that you can't always know 100% for sure if you will miss class or not but still try to be proactive. \n\n\n90% of the time you likely had early warning signs..feel like your getting sick? Throat hurts...start getting worse? Email the professor right away. \n\nSee the fires burning and moving closer? Email professor. \n\nI'm sorry about your parents house, that sounds horrid. And I think that a professor should try to work with you but were you able to talk to them? \n\nI was in an accident on the way to school and still emailed my professor. I've dragged my sick ass to class numerous times. \n\nBut missing the first day of class is a notoriously bad impression and understandable of being dropped because all California schools are heavily impacted and there's just not enough space. \n\nTl;dr Communicate before and be proactive",

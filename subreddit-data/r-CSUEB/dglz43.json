A lot of times hair cut does depend on the length of your hair and what you\u2019re asking for (ex. if you get layers it will be pricier). Also for things like a hair wash it will typically cost you extra. And lots of salons will charge you different based on gender (I\u2019ve seen a guy and a girl get similar haircuts and the girl got charged more). Sleek salon in Fremont is pretty good, but pricing does often depend on the hair you have (ex. if your hair is long and/or thick, they might charge slightly more).",

    "postText": "Hey!\n\nI\u2019ll be entering my last semester next year and was thinking about taking BIOL 425 - Techniques in Mammalian Cell Culture. I\u2019ve heard Dr. Curr teaches it. I was just wondering if anyone had any opinion about the difficulty of the class? I mentioned it to my advisor last semester and they sort of hinted against it because of complaints/difficulty of the class? Left me a little spooked lol Would love to hear thoughts about the class from anyone who has taken it though! I\u2019ll be taking it alongside Genetics and Genomics.\n\nAny feedback would be much appreciated, thanks! :-) \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

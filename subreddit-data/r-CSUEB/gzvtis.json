The only thing that really stood out to me was that \"Your grade is only based on 2 midterms and a final with 3 sheets of notes, front and back\" but I really don't mind it at all",

He actually posts solutions for them too. As long as you go over most of the assignments you should be good. He allows for a sheet of notes during midterms which helps. I recommend this class!",

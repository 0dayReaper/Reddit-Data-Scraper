I have huge breaks in between my classes and I don't live close enough to just drive home and back during breaks. I'm getting bored just sitting on my laptop on campus. You guys know any food places, coffee shops, bars, or just anywhere that's off campus and a nice hangout? thanks! go pios.",

Their personal pizza is ridiculously large and cheap for the price (under 6 bucks i think) and the food is good but the staff is made of 90%  assholes.\n\nI like to chill in the cvs parking lot on nice days. It's never crowded and gets some sun. Plus it's cleaner than the shady meth filled parking lot across the street. \n\nThere's a small downtown area that's clean and newish. A bunch of food places there. I think B street.",

I did a quick Google search and it said conditional admission was for people who did not reach the English requirements but I checked my application and I have reached it. I'm transferring from CC",

It just means they\u2019ve accepted you based on the information you provided about your grades and the classes you intend to take before fall. The \u201ccondition\u201d is that you have reported all previous course work and grades correctly and that you pass/maintain proper GPA in the courses (if any) you put down that you planned to take before fall. If the transcripts show otherwise from what you put down on your application then your acceptance may be rescinded. If not, the you are accepted! Congrats!",

I killed a lot of time just watching Netflix, browsing reddit, and doing homework.\n\nOtherwise, there's a game room with all sorts of stuff to do, clubs, occasionally events like movies in the theater. You can even just go read a book from the library. Don't knock it til you try it.\n\nI too commuted and had huge gaps all the time. One semester, I had Tuesdays where I was there 10AM-10PM with only 3 classes throughout the day. I had to kill a lot of time. If I can do it, you can do it.",

University is always what you make it and just remember that while it\u2019s not wrong to have fun, do you best to make sure you understand the material and that you keep in mind life after college. I\u2019m hoping to get an internship or two before graduating. Also, I plan on applying to jobs during the semester before I graduate. \n\nSome more advice I can give is to practice basic C++ concepts before taking CS 301. And, during your winter break, just find videos on Data structures on YouTube and get a conceptual level of what they are and how they work. \n\nIt\u2019s helped me immensely.",

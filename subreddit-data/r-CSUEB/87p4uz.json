So I can't tell you a whole lot.\n\nStay on top of all the deadlines and be the first one in the door for all of the opportunities to meet with counselors teachers Etc. They don't hold your hand through the transfer process and if you missed the boat you will have last pick of all the classes. I was able to get all the classes I wanted mostly, because I went early.\n\nAll of the staff and professors I have interacted with so far have been very professional and courteous.\n\nContact me again in 6 months and I will have a lot more information for you",

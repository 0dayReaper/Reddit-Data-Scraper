    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019ve been seeing people having issues with graduating on time. I know even spending an extra semester is time consuming and gets in the way of graduate school plans, and of course, it costs more money. Sometimes, advisors may not be the best in terms of making you graduate as early as possible. My friends and I wanted to help you guys with making course plans and giving career advice. We have experience with careers in the medical field, engineering, anthro, etc. Email us at [adviceclass@gmail.com](mailto:adviceclass@gmail.com) if you are interested in receiving a course plan and advice from us. We will be as honest as possible with you based off of our own experiences. We really just want to help students save money and graduate as soon as possible, so you guys aren\u2019t wasting time and money on tuition, living costs, and books! Again, email us at adviceclass@gmail.com if you are interested in trying out our services. We really appreciate your consideration.",

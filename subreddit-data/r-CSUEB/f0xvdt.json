    "postText": "Hello, me and a couple friends are in the process of building a gaming club. We want to know how many students will be interested and joining. Announcements and other information will be shared through discord. Meeting will more then likely happen every Thursday with 2pm-5/6pm being the time the club will be active. The club meeting will either be held at a dorm or Lassen or El Dorado hall.\n\nThe club is starting off small so this is just to test weather people are interested or not and if the time we chose is correct for most students.\n\nDrop down any comments or ideas on what type of events the club should hold and if you are interested.",

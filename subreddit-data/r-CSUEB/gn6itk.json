            "comment": "Unless you're at an Ivy League or a top school (UCB, UCLA, Stanford, etc) no one really cares where you do undergrad. The prestige is all BS. And even the \"prestigious\" schools are really just networking opportunities with a set of (usually, but not always) richer people. You'll get a similar quality of education between CSUEB and SJSU.\n\nI picked EB for the better commute.",

                    "comment": "Excellent post. I agree, although I'd like to point out that, at least for me and my STEM peers, a bachelor's at Berkeley or an Ivy doesn't really give you a bigger head start in title or pay when you do finally start your career. I work at  a biotech where I make more than a UCLA graduate, and we had the same title.\n\nI will also say that when you enter the realm of graduate programs, all that changes. Access to better resources, or more prestigous mentors and professors are indeed factors that are shaped by where you receive your degree - and those factors will shape your thesis, and ultimately the decisions of those looking to hire highly skilled (and compensated) individuals.\n\nIf a graduate degree is the route you wish to take, I would definitely be more picky about that. Bachelor's degree on the other hand, my advice is to make a financially cognizant decision, because entry level positions weigh character, and maybe GPA, rather than where you got your degree.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n... personal character is like 70% of the things companies look for.",

I pretty much made my decision based on whether or not I could picture myself attending the school. So far the opportunities are okay. I really enjoy learning from the faculty at the university so I don't regret my decision.\n\nHowever, my BF is a finance major at SJSU. He absolutely loves it. He pretty much tries extremely hard to leave an impression on his professors because word has it they give internships to the students who do exceptionally well. Opportunity wise, he says its a great school and there's plenty of programs to connect you with different companies, etc.\n\nRegardless of your decision, both schools are great. Wishing you the best of luck.",

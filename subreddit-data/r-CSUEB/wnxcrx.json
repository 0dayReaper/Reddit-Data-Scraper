Really hoping that's right bc I'm counting the days. \n\nIt's frustrating trying to find info on the school site with so many broken or severely out of date pages. Like the financial aid calendar (that was linked in a school email to me) showed something like the dates for 2021 and the tab header stated 2020.",

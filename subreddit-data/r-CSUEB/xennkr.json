You don\u2019t know how far allergies spread in a dorm. What if someone has an allergic reaction not to the bunny but to the Timothy or alfalfa hay it eats? \n\nFurthermore rabbits can be expensive. If it gets out you\u2019ll have tiny poops everywhere (yes they can be litter trained, yes they can be free range, neither of those things should happen in a dorm). Where are you going to get fresh vegetables daily? Hay, bedding, and enrichment toys cost money. \n\nConsider the alternative. You get caught with a rabbit. Now what happens? Where does the rabbit have to go? \n\nOwning a pet in college, unless you live off campus, is not a good idea. I\u2019m sorry. Take this from someone who has gone through a lot of animal ownership in their life. Sometimes you just shouldn\u2019t own something until you have the space for it.",

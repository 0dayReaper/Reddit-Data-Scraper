It's a nice enough campus and the faculty are very knowledgeable and helpful. \n\nThe one downside is that since the campus is on a hill, it's isolated from the rest of the community. It's too bad there isn't anything interesting near the campus, like coffee shops and bookstores to go to like there are in Berkeley.",

So far I'm only in the filipino club but I might join some Greek club later in spring. It's my 2nd year here, but technically my social life is still 1st year cause i had some stuff to deal with in my freshman year. In terms of social life, I'm a very relaxed and chill person and I prefer to find some real down to earth chill people who aren't so crazy and extroverted. So for me, finding those types of people have been hard lol, everyone is crazily extroverted here.\n\n\nI'm in Sociology but switching out soon.",

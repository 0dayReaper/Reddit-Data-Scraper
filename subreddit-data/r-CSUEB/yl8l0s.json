            "comment": "I took an Asian-American/Pacific Islander Film Fest course 2 summers ago. All we did was watch a movie and write a piece on it; no midterms nor quizzes. But keep in mind, this was a summer course...idk how its structured during Fall/Spring. It was ES363 for 3 units\n\nAnother easy class I took during the same summer was Women and Leisure. No midterms or quizzes, just read an article or pages from the text and write about it. It was also for 3 units and the course code is REC310\n\nSpring 2021 I took KIN162 which is nutrition and performance, no midterms but there are quizzes, homeworks, and a team presentation...extremely easy class. Our presentation prompt was to make a workout list and the benefits of doing said workouts. This was also 3 units\n\nThis semester, I'm taking ES360 which is Asian/American Intimacies and Families. No midterms, no quizzes, just a weekly essay on materials posted (youtube vids, online articles) and no textbook required; also 3 units",

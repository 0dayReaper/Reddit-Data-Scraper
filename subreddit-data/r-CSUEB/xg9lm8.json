    "postText": "Hello you guys, I was wondering if anybody in this Sub has any knowledge regarding the whole CS department at East Bay and can give any insight on if professors are any good if there\u2019s opportunities whether it be career fairs or internships etc.  or any other Pros and Cons. A little background info i am bay area resident about same distance to both schools and will be taking BART to beat traffic as well am a  transfer from CC however i was pre nursing who made career change so i would be taking all CS classes as if I was a freshman. Thank you!",

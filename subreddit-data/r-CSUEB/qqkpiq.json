You can test out of this requirement with a 50 question test online - which I HAVE to do as I live out of state now. \n\nId like to know if it\u2019s open note or open book, and if you have to use respondus or some other online proctor. Also, same as OP\u2019s question- did you find it difficult. \n\nThanks!",

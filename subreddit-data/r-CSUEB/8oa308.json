He is the person to talk to about the program.\n\nAs said before, there are a lot of applied classes like R, SAS, Data Visualization, NLP, Machine Learning.\n\nWeaker on actuarial science if you are going the actuary route.  Graduate school is somewhat what you make of it.  if a student decides to wing it then it will hurt him on the job market.  But if you are like me, I have taken more classes than needed and believe that I have a good education at CSUEB. Of course then it comes down to what the school offers.\n\nSchool has a lot of international students. My cousin goes to University of Toronto.\n\nMessage me with what you decide and if you come here. ",

I do plan on applying to CSUEB for grad school, but not too sure if I'll make it with my GPA. Regardless, going to give it a shot. \n\nOh dang small world! What's your cousin studying here?",

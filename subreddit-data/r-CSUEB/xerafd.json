Do you think I\u2019m going to receive cal grant A for this semester or next semester? Maybe we can only get one specific grant a semester not both? Idk. I\u2019ll give them a call soon.",

So th way that discernment works is that the school receives the financial aid and applies it to your tuition, dorms (if on campus) some books that got charged to your student account if your professor did that and then you receive the remaining balance after all that's gone through.",

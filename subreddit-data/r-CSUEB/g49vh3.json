    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm planning to take a few of my major classes during summer. And I was wondering how much do they cost per unit to take, considering all classes are now online meaning their is no maintenance fee or health whatever bs the school likes to call it. Also taking a major class during the summer at CSUEB will count for my major right?\n\nHope everyone is doing well! Stay put :)",

I\u2019m taking 12 units to get ahead and it\u2019s gonna cost me 4K.. I heard summer is really intensive because of how short the summer classes are. So choose wisely how many classes you decide to take. Don\u2019t overwhelm yourself.",

You should still get in touch with your major counselor and an acee advisor every semester just to stay on track with things. It\u2019s helped me a lot.",

Also keep in mind that the summer session is essentially a full semester in half the time and it\u2019s been suggested that taking 6 units in the summer is about the equivalent of taking 12 units in a semester workload wise. \nThat being said, I am considering taking a 3 unit class myself to lessen the load a little for next school year.",

Most schools don\u2019t admit students for a second bachelor\u2019s degree. There may be exceptions (ie nursing), however, that\u2019s rare.\n\nIf you are asking about a double major within a program in which you are currently enrolled, you will need to complete paperwork with the registrar. Majors, minors, and concentrations will need to be processed with the registrar prior to the awarding of degree. This is typically the responsibility of the student.",

But as u/venanzimus said, people are generally nice, and talking about the where people commute from is a good conversation starter. There is a really good mini shopping center above campus (&lt;5min walk, &lt;10min drive, it's hard to explain the logic there) that has fantastic pizza, a great liquor store, subway... that one shaved ice chain, a Chinese food place. Its dope. Its a good school. Take philosophy classes with Dr. Derksen and Dr. Cabot.",

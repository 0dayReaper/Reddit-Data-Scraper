    "postText": "Looking to get more information on these programs. I'm 31, returning to school and trying to figure out which major to go with. CS is probably more practical but I'd have to take a TON of math classes just to even transfer in. It's a lot of math anyway but I'd basically be starting from intermediate algebra or trig (never did calc in HS).\n\nOn the other hand I'm also an amateur game designer (tabletop games) and I am super interested in game design, both video and tabletop so the BFA in game design seems appealing. I'm wondering if it'd be best to do the BFA and then just take some miscellaneous programming classes as electives or at the community college because programming is a skill I'd very much like to have (I've only dabbled in it). \n\nPost college, I'd like to either work as a developer of some kind or a game designer. CS skills would be beneficial for either of those, not really mandatory for game design but for video game design it'd certainly help.",

So it's like an extra 1.5 years of school. I actually have some of the BFA requirements done because I was going for multimedia a few years back so I could get that degree done fairly quickly and for a lot less $. \n\nI still want to take some CS electives though or maybe go for a CS certificate at the community college, or possibly do a boot camp but that's more so web development specifically.",

Minors aren\u2019t necessarily huge with employers, but it gives you a leg up over boot camp grade with no degree in some ways. As long as the minor has you do DSA it\u2019ll be a huge help. \n\nI have friends that did the boot camp route and they got hired a few years back during the boom times. Many are glad they did it, but they also express this lack of knowledge that they feel the need to overcome. Most bootcamps don\u2019t focus heavily on CA theory or the really deep conceptual questions (like recursion vs iteration). You can self teach but school gives you a chance to bounce ideas off of more knowledgeable people than yourself. \n\nEither way, it sounds like you\u2019re making plans. Talk to the academic advisors on campus if you can. Tell them your goals, what you\u2019re doing to accomplish them, and get their input. Make sure you get the roadmap for each degree to help you plan your semesters out and keep track of what classes count for different degree requirements. \n\nI wish you the best OP. Work hard, have fun, and enjoy the ride. I\u2019m glad to see more non traditional transfers because it usually means that they have a goal they\u2019re focused on, and I\u2019m glad they can push for it.",

I am not interested in that university and I want to go to east bay. Did I do something wrong with the application and is there a way to fix it? Or should I just wait for east bay to contact me?",

That being said, I'm pretty sure you will get contacted one way or another it might just take East Bay longer to make that decisions idk. Calling in and talking to someone is always a good solution though.",

I want to gather some insight about the major as well as the college experience. Can anyone who is a CS major tell me a little bit about the major? Is it hard to get into the classes you need to take in order to graduate? Does most student graduate in two years? How supportive are the professor?",

            "comment": "The professors are pretty solid overall. As far as the CS classes go there isn't too many problems getting lower and mid division classes until you get to the upper divisions with a ton of CS elective classes packed each semester. You may have some issues with some more popular GE classes if you still need them but otherwise it isn't too bad.",

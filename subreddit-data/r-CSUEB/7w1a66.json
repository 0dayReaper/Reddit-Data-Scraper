I wanted to let you know that after reading this feedback, our library management team had a long discussion this afternoon on ways that we can better prevent messes by the computers and on the first floor.  We have a preliminary internal plan in place that will start with more frequent cleaning of our computers and additional signage.\n\nYour feedback matters, so please feel free to message me directly (or reply to this thread).  We feel your pain -- as library staff, we want to provide cleaner spaces for our community, but are restricted by some of the policies, procedures, and hierarchies on our campus.  Additionally, it would be difficult for us to outright ban food in the library since student really want to eat while they study (and it would be difficult to regulate).\n\nEDIT: I forgot to add, the university is building a new library with hopes that it will open in 2020/2021.  Make sure to let our admin and staff know what you're looking for in the new library!",

My suggestion, in the mean time, is to definitely utilize the cubicles on the second floor (especially the study areas by the East Entrance) which are very quiet.  We'll do our best to improve our regulation of those study spaces to keep them quiet.\n\nFor the new library, we have had many discussions about designating a specific floor (it's going to be a 3 floor building) as \"quiet\" so that students know, the moment they step on that floor, that it's a quiet zone!",

The space is a bit small relative to the current library, so there will be 3 floors.  The library staff has worked really hard to address concerns that we need more power and student study spaces in the library -- more than what we have now.  \n\nThe current library space will be partially used to store some of our books (the \"collection\" as we call it).  Since we are only taking 20% of our \"collection\" to the new library, this means more space for study areas (quiet and group) for our students.\n\nYour voice is really important in the process.  We need more student input, so if you see stations across campus asking for feedback about the new library -- please participate!\n\nAlso note that we anticipate this new library being built by 2022ish.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the response. I frequently use the second floor cubicles and, personally, I find a lot of people eat meals there. Not snacks, but lunch and dinner: instant ramen, subway, panda, etc, all while watching videos on their computers. The smells permeate the densely packed cubicles. I find it distracting and inappropriate. This behavior wouldn't be tolerated in a classroom or professional setting.\n\nHowever, I sympathize that there really isn't a good place to take a break and eat near the library. The union buildings are noisy and messy, as they should be. The school cafeteria is off the beaten path and charges a massive cover. Just brainstorming, the library could use a designating eating area. The area enveloping Starbucks seems like a natural choice.",

We get these reports a lot too.\n\nWe're currently researching policies at other schools to see what we can do to adapt our policies for the new/current building.  I personally like the idea of a designated eating area and communicated this to our Dean.  To be honest, it's going to be a huge challenge to try to implement this in our current building, but we can also build it into the new one.  The place you suggested -- the area near Starbucks -- houses thousands of dollars worth of technology equipment.  We're fearful that if that becomes the space where people can eat whatever they want, it will come at the expense of the technology that students use.  ",

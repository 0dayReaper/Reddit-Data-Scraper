It will help you with your friend/roommate search, buy &amp; sell things for your dorm, off-campus housing, rides &amp; more... Anyways just check it out, you won't regret it!\n\nIt's a school-based app, you can only log in once you verify your [**csueastbay.edu**](https://csueastbay.edu) school email! (you'll receive a 5 digit code in your inbox)\n\nFollow on Instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/collegesouk/](https://www.instagram.com/collegesouk/) and tell your friends!\n\nlink to the app: [https://collegesouk.com/](https://collegesouk.com/)\n\nJust want to mention that the idea is abstracted to support multiple universities :) each university got its own separate platform! upvote for visibility - THANKKKSSS!\n\nAlso, please dm me if you are interested in contributing!

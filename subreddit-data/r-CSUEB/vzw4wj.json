            "comment": "I\u2019d recommend it. Here\u2019s my wall of text about my experiences while working there.\n\nI worked there for three years and in UPD for a year in my undergrad. I mainly worked as a Student Parking Officer. The people who work in the parking office are awesome and will look out for you. That\u2019s the same for most of the Officers in UPD, the chief is especially cool to talk too. The thing that matters here is that they care and respect the fact that you\u2019re a student first.\n\nDay to day, the job has you either walking or golf carting around campus issuing tickets. It\u2019s a lot of exercise and you have to be comfortable with confrontation (usually people aren\u2019t too happy when you give them tickets). Theres also a semi-mandatory week of work at the end of the year where you help out with graduation. If there\u2019s a good reason you can\u2019t make it, they\u2019ll keep you on as a employee.\n\nThere\u2019s not really an intrinsic upside of working the job other than it\u2019s money and that you can reliably get hours with a full-time class schedule. I personally used to work the evening/night shifts to hit my maximum allowed hours per week for students (20 hours/week). The downside is if you walk you\u2019re going to burn through a lot of shoes\u2014I used to get a new pair every few months. Also you\u2019ll start to get some notoriety around campus since students will remember your face if you give them a ticket. It\u2019s really based on your interpersonal skills for how your reputation follows you.\n\nAt my highest I was paid $14.50 as the Co-Lead Student Service Officer during the parking-upd merge, and my starting pay as a student parking officer was $12.50. Your starting pay may change with any increases to minimum wage and inflation.\n\nOther things about the job:\n1) For night shifts they usually assign you with another student for safety reasons. Sometimes you can request who you can work with. They may also just partner you up with them if they know you\u2019re friends and can stay on task while working together.\n\n2) My favorite part of the job was hunting for forged permits. They\u2019re sometime really hard to find.\n\n3) Don\u2019t leave your beanie in the freezer.\n\nSide note: \nAvoid working as a Student Service Officer (SSO), unless the supervisor for it has changed since I was working there. The guy was a real piece of work, and hazed the Student Parking Officers during the merger between UPD and Parking and Transportation. He believed in group punishments, and would try his best to break students down emotionally. He also really didn\u2019t care about the fact that you\u2019re a student. If he didn\u2019t like you, he\u2019d try his best to get you fail your classes by giving you late night shifts. Especially if he knew you had early morning classes. They\u2019re 10pm-2am shifts, so you\u2019re really getting home closer to 3-4am depending on where you live, since you also have to sign out and get out of your uniform before going home.\n\nShorter Version in case you don\u2019t want to read my crap.\n\nParking and Transportation is a great place to work for a student job if you can handle the walking and confrontations. Pay is above average for student jobs and they know you\u2019re a student first. If you decide to work there, get some good comfortable shoes and be empathetic towards students when you give them tickets.",

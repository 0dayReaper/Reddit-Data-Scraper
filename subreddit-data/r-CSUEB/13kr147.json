            "comment": "I was in it fall 2019 and finished spring 2021, so I was there for a time before and during the pandemic. I liked it more before it went online. Once it was online I lost interest and didn\u2019t see myself going into the field. I feel like I missed the chance to network and build more connections. \n\nIt\u2019s a short program that can be done in a year so you\u2019re limited in what you can take for electives because not all courses are offered simultaneously.\n\nHonestly, you get what you put into it. In the end I put in the bare minimum. I wouldn\u2019t do it again, but having a masters helped me negotiate a raise, and the piece of paper made me a better candidate in the job I have now. \n\nI also got a bunch of grants I wasn\u2019t expecting which canceled out that stupid additional per unit fee they had. So in total the program costed me less than $15k.\n\nI liked learning about data mining, Tableau, and SQL. I don\u2019t care about AI/machine learning and that seemed to be what a lot of the program was leaning towards.\n\nTLDR; know the field/job you want to get and find out the steps you need to take to get to where you want to go. If this program supports that, go for it.",

The course is good, you learn many new skills which are required in the analytics domain, only if you are interested in learning.  \nThe professors' reviews are mixed, some are very good, while for others you may feel like missing classes.  \nIn short, I am liking it, I also got accepted into SJSU MSDA, but chose CSUEB over it.",

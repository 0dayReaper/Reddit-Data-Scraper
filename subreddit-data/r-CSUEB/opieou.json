I read the terms and conditions- it said something along the lines of \u201cthe value of the device will be posted to your financial aid account\u201d. I think this just means that the fact that you have already used the voucher will be posted onto your account BUT I am not sure.",

If you needed to pay it back it would be considered a loan which is entirely different.",

I got a brand new iPad back in 2019 and only paid the difference of the voucher.\n\nThe device voucher straight up takes off $500 off of eligible devices (like laptops) in the bookstore. I literally just talked to them in person if anyone wants my source lol",

I just don\u2019t want people to see this and not take advantage of the voucher. You DO NOT have to repay the $500 device voucher. Please contact the Pioneer Bookstore if you need more information on this subject.",

Any recommendations for fun online classes or should I just go through the catalog and pick whatever looks interesting? And when will summer class schedule be released?\n\nTake care.",

I think that\u2019s accurate give or take a day or two if I\u2019m wrong. You could also go to csueb website and there\u2019s the academic calendar tab you could look for all the dates for stuff like this. Good luck!",

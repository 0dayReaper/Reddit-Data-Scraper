    "postText": "My Girlfriend and I are looking for roommates to move in around CSUEB around mid July. Having a hard time finding anyone so if you are interested please DM me. \nMust be 420 friendly. \nMax rent we can afford is probably around 600-700 per person range. \nLooking for someone who is relatively clean and doesn't mind having 1-3 people over often. We are not looking to throw massive parties but don't mind if people come hang out. Pets okay as long as you pay the pet deposit and pet rent.",

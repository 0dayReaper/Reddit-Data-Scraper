            "comment": "In terms of the faculty who teach the classes in the program, there are either phenomenal professors who you'll meet doing the program, and incredibly mediocre instructors who make you really regret doing the graphic design program. Look up the art department's faculty and I can tell you from experience being in this program currently that Rate My Professor is very telling. Unfortunately there's certain instructors that you're inevitably going to come across, so if you're adamant about taking the program here, power through and create connections with your classmates and alumni because you'll need it. In the end though, your portfolio will speak as much as your degree, if not more. Good luck!",

I told her that I thought that I was going slowly (aka not taking a full 15 units each sem) but my advisor said it was just about the same pace as all other GD students. So far my upper division projects have been interesting and informative where I've done packaging, brochures, book covers, spreads, et cetera. I've been able to use a majority of the Adobe suite of which the school gives you free access. Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere, and Dimensions were all used in my projects. Again if you're going to take up the GD program here just brace yourself for possibly having a slower than average program and the possibility of having really excellent professors you don't feel like you deserve, or others that just bog your motivation to stay in this program.",

Outside of school I work somewhat in the art field where I have access to meet tons of potential internships/career leads so make sure you're adamant on talking to as many people as possible. Speaking of, there's a class called Forum which we all take, and each class meeting is a new artist who speaks of their experiences in the field.",

Would like to talk to others to share tips and what not.. also if you\u2019ve done this program I would love to hear some input. Currently going through the financial aid process (super pricey) and going through the rate my professor reviews (all of them seem bad). Would love some feedback whether this online major is worth it. Thank you!!",

            "comment": "Graduating this Fall with the online BSBA program. I chose the IT Management concentration so my experience is pertaining to that.\n\nEveryone's experience is different but here's mine:\n\n1. You really have to be self-sufficient. A lot of instructors (not all) are content with assigning the work, posting a video of their lectures and calling it a day, which isn't bad if you're trying to just get the degree to check the box. Some are great but it's few and far between. I would highly suggest coming into the program with ample online class experience and good studying techniques. You kinda get what you put in. I was able to get a 3.6 GPA without too much trouble. Rate my professor is your best friend!\n2. Watch your degree audit like a hawk. Faculty was basically useless and slow to respond to emails (if at all). I realized later I was missing some requirements that I didn't catch before hand. A couple times I had to enroll at a community college for that odd Anthropology class that I somehow missed. Transferring credits can feel like pulling teeth. They'll transfer eventually but they are slow to enter transcripts in the system and claim they never received them.  \n3. Get used to Respondus LockDown Browser and Monitor for exams. Have an area free from devices and noise. Just about all classes have started using it.\n4. Maintaining a good GPA will sometimes score you a small scholarship for the next semester (one class, like $1,300). Happened to me for the last 2 semesters.\n5. That being said, this major is 100% online and asynchronous. For someone like me who works full time, I don't see how I could have gotten a degree any other way. For that reason I'm very appreciative a program like this exists. Makes it worth the extra money to me.\n6. Group up as much as possible. Make a Discord or Slack channel study group for each class. You'll gain useful insight from other students about what to expect on tests. \n7. Class sections for the online program are only allowed for people in enrolled in that program. Meaning on-campus students can't take the sections if they feel like taking an online class. This makes it easy to choose the classes/professors you need as there will be room as long as you register on your appointment date.\n8. You can take classes in the spring, summer and fall. No winter sessions for this program.\n\nI know I said a lot of negatives but overall I am happy with the experience. It served its purpose for me, which was a program that I can take to get a bachelor's while still being able to work full time. Not too obtrusive if you stay on top of things. It bears repeating, stay on top of your graduation requirements. They'll let you into the program while missing some lower division requirements and not tell you. This program is too expensive to go through it inefficiently.",

I too work full time and that\u2019s why I\u2019m willing to pay for this very very expensive program.. may I ask how long it took you to graduate or how many classes a semester you took? \nI\u2019m trying to finish pretty quickly and I could have done up to 6 classes in community college with all A\u2019s, but I\u2019m not sure if this program would be too intense to handle. \nI know the summer semester is a lot shorter, does that mean you take less classes then? \nI\u2019m assuming having our tests proctored means no help at all from Chegg and Quizlet? \ud83d\ude02 sounds like a lotttttt of studying. \nThanks so much for your feedback. I sometimes feel like quitting just because it\u2019s so expensive and don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be worth it. I think I\u2019ll stick with it and try my best.",

                            "comment": "I started in Fall 2019 and graduating this Fall. So a little over 2 years. I took 3 classes each semester (including summer), except for this last session where I took 2. This doesn't count the couple of lower-division courses I took at a community college to fill in some missing requirements. I took 3 courses because I couldn't afford to fail any. In hindsight, I probably could have taken 4 a semester and graduated a bit sooner, but it definitely wouldn't have been comfortable. There is an 18 unit limit for semesters fyi, 11 units for summer. \n\nChegg and Quizlet (and Coursehero) came in clutch many times, so I definitely think you'll be using that to study, even if you can't use it during exams. \n\nThe one thing I can tell you is do not quit! I felt the exact same way as you when I started. It's likely that you'll want a BS at some point in your life. Just get it over with now. 2 years fly by and before you know it you are filling out graduation paperwork. The fact that you got admitted to this program means you are already halfway done. You can do it!!",

Then you passed the hardest class in the program imo.\n\nThe MGMT courses are mostly busy work and memorizing concepts with the odd group project here and there. Decision science seems like its math heavy but you use Excel to do most of the calculations. ITM classes can be tough if you don't have a basic IT background. Make sure you know the basics of Python because it's a required class. Tons of resources available online. One weekend of review will prepare you.",

I definitely recommend doing a couple problems everyday, writing notes based on the lectures/skimming the textbook, and reviewing the notes. It's a very time consuming class haha\n\nShe has lectures for every chapter and we do a total of 2-3 discussion posts. There's also a financial analysis project we do in the beginning of the semester which is fairly easy to do since she provides the templates and shows us exactly how she wants us to do it. \n\nOur homework &amp; tests are through McGraw Connect and the exams are proctored with webcam on! She allows us to use one page of notes &amp; our calculators for the exams :)\n\nShe gives us a lot of optional review/practice questions to prepare for the exams that are pretty helpful! What's on there won't be the same as on the test but any extra help is beneficial! I seriously recommend skimming your notes and doing at least 1-2 problems every day! \n\nAlso the rest of my classes have proctored exams but sometimes it'll just be a lockdown browser and others will require an ID check, camera &amp; mic on. It varies from professor to professor. I currently have a class where we haven't had an exam yet but a lot of essays &amp; discussion posts.",

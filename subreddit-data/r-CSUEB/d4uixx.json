If you have the means and dedication to continue your education then it's really never too late to switch majors. If you want to be done with school and enter the work force in the field you graduated in, the humanities and most sciences aren't the best choice. \n\nThis is a general statement but I can speak for anthropology specifically since my boyfriend graduated from a UC with an Anthropology degree and is now working an IT job, which was his hobby and knowledge base before college anyways.",

But it's probably too late for you to change classes now so you just need to finish this semester. I recommend you talk to the department about changing major.",

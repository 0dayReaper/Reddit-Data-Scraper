    "postText": "I applied and got into the teacher credential program. initially, it was conditional but I passed the CSET and it's no longer conditional. \nive yet to hear from the school, only the department. has anyone experienced this? the department told me not to worry and that if you're accepted into the department, most likely you're accepted into the school. but I haven't received any information from the school. apparently it'll be a letter. \n?\nlmao. I went to Csulb and everything seemed to be an email. do they keep things personal or what? is this normal? just confused because I'm the first in my family to do something like this, and I don't know what's going on tbh.",

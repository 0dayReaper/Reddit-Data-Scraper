Some good hills by Parking Lot C you could hike around.  \n\nAs for professors, I'm doing in-person completely and they seem nice.  Some sections of the same class are online and some professors allow you to join them if you wanna go online or can't make it in-person as long as you let them know and show up for tests and quizzes for your original section.",

With online classes it\u2019s easy to cheat and hard to actually learn unless you apply yourself. The professors are chill and nice for the most part. I had one give me an extension on my final paper because of a family emergency.",

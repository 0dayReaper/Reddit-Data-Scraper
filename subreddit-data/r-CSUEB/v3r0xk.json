I know it seems like a lot of information will be given but I\u2019ve been to other orientations before and most of them seem like you can pretty much leave after 2pm.",

A lot of information was given and most of it was helpful. \n\nThe morning is university level and then after lunch it goes to college and then major. If you haven't met with your major advisor or signed up for courses yet, definitely go. \n\nMine ended way before 5pm. I was done around 4. There was a ton of walking around campus though and actually seeing buildings was nice vs just having a map. \n\nIf you already know your class schedule, you can look for the rooms they'll be in if you have any on campus.",

It helped us a lot because they didn't need to keep us long. \n\nStaying or going is a personal choice. They didn't take attendance or anything, but they'll know if you didn't go because of the check in at the beginning. \n\nI stayed because I live in so cal so it was a chance for me to see the campus and get a good overall vibe. If you live in the area though it might be different for you. \n\nHave fun tomorrow!",

I want to concentrate on either child development or adolescent development. I also wanna know if my current job as an online classroom aide can be counted for a teaching credential. Thanks!",

I loved it, and don\u2019t regret majoring in it. I\u2019m off to SJSU\u2019s Masters program in K-12 counseling with my BA in HDEV. One suggestion is look on rate my professor, those reviews were pretty spot on. Throughout my time here, I tried to stick with the professors whose class structures help me thrive.\nMy faves: Dr. Guzzardo, Dr. Drew, Dr. Sprott, Dr. Comerford, Dr. Rashedi, Dr. Williams, and Dr. Borish (as noted ^ some material is older and a challenge to get the reader.)\n\nNot so fave: Prof.Dr(?) Felton\n\nAnother thing, a lot of people are critical of the ideology and stances of Borish and Comerford related to recent events making a lot of people not like them, but I learned and thrived with their online structures.",

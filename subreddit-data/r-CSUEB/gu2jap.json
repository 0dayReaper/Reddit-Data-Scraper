Even if the deadline is today...just breath and it\u2019ll get resolved. \n\nIn the future though - don\u2019t wait until the very last day to get it worked out. Especially if the very last day is a Sunday.  Plan for issues.  \n\nOk now go have safe, distanced fun. Don\u2019t stress.",

Last fall the online payment system had error after error...including a few errors which had to be hand corrected by the FA office.   Just didn\u2019t want you stressing all night - they KNOW the system is deeply flawed!!!",

Which is good news.\n\nThe only thing is that it says I still haven't paid my pre-enrollment fee. I'm assuming that is just the payment still being processed, but I'm glad that my acceptance of admission finally went through!",

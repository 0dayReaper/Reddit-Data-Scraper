    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI am an incoming international transfer student.\n\nI got accepted in both CSUEB and CSULB for my CS program.\n\nI have accepted offer for CS in CSUEB. However, after my friend advice (who has previously live in Santa Clara County) and a spike of criminal activity. I have reconsidered my decision.\n\nSo Should I keep my admission to CSUEB or should I transfer to CSULB?\n\nI choose CSUEB because its not too crowded and also located in the Bay which has abundant tech jobs available.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

            "comment": "Santa Clara is on the other side of the bay. Hayward is much nicer than people think it is. Tech jobs are a bit more abundant in the bay - if you manage to land your first, you might as well stay here for the long run. People at East Bay sometimes get FAANG internships (but that\u2019s more of an exception)\n\nAs far as your question goes\u2026 Depends on what kind of CS you\u2019re going looking to do - any career prospects yet?\n\nCSUEB CS department is expanding its security and human-computer interaction programs right now, if you are interested in that. Also in the past few years some professors became rather active, working on projects with students - there are mobile apps, websites, drones (all I can remember right now). Research wasn\u2019t that big (or I wasn\u2019t good enough for it) when I went there.\n\nAs far as interview prep goes - Data Structures and Algorithms classes aren\u2019t sufficient to pass interviews in my experience. You will have to catch up to that on your own.\n\nUpper division, graduate classes are quite interesting, those were my favorite. I\u2019ve taken machine learning (not AI) and IoT, very engaging, and I found them useful at work.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, I started my first quarter here at East Bay this winter and wanted to get some suggestions on how a few things. First off, I am a very social person and although I know dorming is mostly just me learning to be independent, I would love to meet people and begin to build relationships. Secondly, I am a photographer from Los Angeles and eager to shoot landscape photos up here, I know of the views from on campus but would anyone have any suggestions for cool places to shoot?  ",

It's often referred to as a commuter school. \n\nThe bay is a great place to take photos! Don't forget to check out the south bay and along the coast as well. \n\nHere's a link to some in SF:\nhttps://www.findingtheuniverse.com/2015/10/a-guide-to-great-photography-locations.html?m=1\n\nOthers:\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-photography-spots-in-the-Bay-Area",

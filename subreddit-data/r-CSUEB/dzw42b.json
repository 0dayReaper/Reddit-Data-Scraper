    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI was recently accepted to CSU East Bay. My hometown is Riverside, California, which is the city I was born and raised in.\n\nI would like to know everything I need to know about living in Hayward, and the Bay in general. \n\nI've recently had to start learning how to navigate LA after starting to go there more often, so I'm assuming there's other stuff I need to know about the Bay.\n\nI'm aware that crime is a big problem in SF; how much would I have to worry in Hayward? How can I avoid being a victim (or, if that's impossible, keep it to a minimum)? I've heard that car break-ins are pretty much an inevitability. I already have the knowledge necessary to not get myself killed walking around in Riverside, but what should I know about Hayward?\n\nWhat should I know about navigating public transit?\n\nAll that kind of stuff.",

            "comment": "Hayward really isn't anything like SF. Its much more suburban and working class. Will you be living on campus? Or in the city of Hayward? Depending in where in Hayward things to do, public transit, and crime will vary. If you're living off campus the school runs free shuttles to and from the BART station (our crappy local train system). Avoiding car break-ins is kinda hard cuz even if there's nothing in there (which there shouldn't be, only keep the minimum in there: insurance and registration) it might still get broken into. That's just life in a city.\n\nI mean coming from Riverside you'll get your bearings just fine, from what i know about riverside.",

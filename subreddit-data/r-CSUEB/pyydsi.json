    "postText": "Hello Everyone, \n\nI am at a cc and I\u2019m looking to transfer to CSUEB with 96 units in total, and I\u2019m a CS major. I will have an ADT in CS by the end of spring 2022. So is it still possible for me to transfer to csueb with 90+ units into CS. What problems will I face having 90+ units when transferring?",

You will likely need to do course substitution petitions for major classes that don't have a direct equivalent (see: assist.org).\n\nSecond, there is a 70 unit maximum transfer limit from Community Colleges. ([https://www.csueastbay.edu/online/is-online-right-for-me/online-campus-faqs.html](https://www.csueastbay.edu/online/is-online-right-for-me/online-campus-faqs.html)). You will also need to complete at least 45 units in residence at CSUEB to graduate.\n\nLastly, you will want to stay focused because once you are past \\~140 units CSUs will generally start hounding you to graduate. Sometimes they will place administrative holds and choose your classes for you.",

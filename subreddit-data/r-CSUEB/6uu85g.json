            "comment": "It depends on what year you are. It is easier to get housing as a freshman than a sophomore because there is more freshman housing. I'd apply as soon as the housing portal opens. Sophomore housing you have to finish your application in the first hour that the housing portal opens to get a spot. Freshman housing is slightly more lenient, but I'd still do it the instant it opens. So, housing is fairly hard to get into. This is to get housing for the whole year, if you are trying to enter housing winter quarter or spring then it would probably be very hard.\n\nUpper division housing I do not know at all.",

                            "comment": "I lived in the dorms freshman year and I'll be living in them again sophomore year. I'll describe what the freshman dorms are like. The freshman dorms are Tamalpais, Juniper, and Sequoia. Dorms are all apartment style with rooms connecting to a living area with a kitchen, two bathrooms. Freshman dorms do not have a stove or an oven, but there is a microwave and a full sized fridge. There are four rooms, two doubles and two triples. I personally thought the freshman dorms have too many people. It can get crowded and if someone doesn't clean up after themselves it's hard to found out who is doing that. Otherwise I liked how the dorms were set up. I never had any problems with any neighbors being noisy, the walls are pretty thin though. I could hear my roommates talking in the living room. It's not too loud if you are trying to sleep. Some of this varies on what roommates and neighbors you have though. Having a kitchen, although small, was nice. There is no air conditioning, so it can get hot, but since CSUEB is on a hill and gets windy at times, opening a window usually works fairly well. They did change the first floor of Tamalpais to sophomore housing, but otherwise there is no way to get back into the freshman dorms which I like. From what I've looked at all non-freshman pioneer heights dorms have a better kitchen, and have max six people in a dorm. The double I'm in next year has two rooms with two people, so four people which will be a lot more manageable.",

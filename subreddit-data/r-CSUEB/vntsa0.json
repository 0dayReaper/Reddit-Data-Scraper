    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a new transfer student for the fall 2022. I accepted my loans, and did my entrance counseling, and the master promissory note on may 11. The entrance counseling was processed, but the master promissory is still pending. It\u2019s been a month, and a half, and I am now so worried that why my master promissory can\u2019t go through. I\u2019ve been calling the financial aid office, and the fafsa, and they haven\u2019t been able to give me a definite answer. What should I do? I am just so worried for this.",

The best way to figure this out is in person at the end of the day if no one is solving your issues by phone.\n\nEdit: I also highly recommend this from experience. Every time I\u2019ve called or emailed their responses are typically generic and nonhelpful (typically), but going physically in they have resolved everything I\u2019ve needed easily!",

This should be updated by early August.\n\nIf you are still concerned, you are welcome to PM me your netid and I can look it up and confirm the MPN is done and close your checklist item.",

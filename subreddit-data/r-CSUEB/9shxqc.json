A good percentage of the students commute from all over the Bay Area and don't spend a whole lot of time on campus to socialize. There are a few fun events on campus occasionally. Your best bet at making friends would be to join a club or sorority/fraternity that aligns with your interests. \n\nI don't think sororities/fraternities have an age limit for their members (that would just invite legal troubles...).",

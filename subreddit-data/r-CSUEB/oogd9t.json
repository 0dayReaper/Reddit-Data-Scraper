    "postText": "So I am an incoming freshman and my financial aid is not showing up so I still have the total amount due for my semester. I have received a pell grant and a cal grant that would cover most of it but it's not been deducted from my amount due. Today is the day for payment so idk what to do.\n\nI have enrolled in a payment plan because I can't afford the full semester amount. However, when I did this, I  got an email saying I got a Financial Aid Fee deferral so like wtf. Why didn't I get that deferral before I made my $30 enrollment plan fee? If I pay my first installment plan, will they give me a refund if my financial aid finally gets added to my amount due? What if I don't pay?  Can I unenroll and keep the deferral? Wtf am I supposed to do I am so confused and my counselor gave me the most useless response to my email and I cant email him again because he practically responds once every day regardless if you follow up right after. I also already emailed finaid@csueb but they haven't responded to me for 3 days.\n\nSomeone, **please tell me cause idk what I'm doing.**",

I am in a similar position, my first time having financial aid- all the literature from CSUEBs site says that as long as your aid will cover the full amount you will not be dropped from classes and financial aid will pay out on aug 17.",

What I did now, is paid the first installment plan and hopefully, when my financial aid gets added or whatever, they will be able to give me a refund or something.",

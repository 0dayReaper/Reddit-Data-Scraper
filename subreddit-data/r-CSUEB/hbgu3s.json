    "postText": "Hi! I am a 2018 SF State graduate with a degree in graphic design. After having worked in the graphic design field for two years now, I am heavily considering becoming a middle or high school art teacher. Graphic design has fulfilled the creative part of me, but I have a passion for teaching.\n\nI am wondering how competitive CSUEB's teaching program is to get into? Thank you!",

During orientation they implied that there were plenty of spots this year. Hope that helps.",

I waited too long to reach out to a former teacher of mine and by the time I got around to doing it schools started closing. Thankfully the program suspended the field experience requirement for this year but they will likely bring it back next spring should schools open up.",

Furthermore, anything about the internship program? My biggest obstacle is figuring out how to make money for rent, etc.",

    "postText": "I am international applicant and submitted MS (Business Analytics) spring 2023 application to CSU Eastbay. I have to upload unofficial transcript and test score document in a email link which will be sent by CSU Eastbay. However, I am yet to receive the email link for it. Despite sending mails to international office admission team, I'm not getting any response from them. Document submission deadline is 15th of October 2023. CSU EB  application portal \"to do\" list says I'd receive the email link for submitting unofficial transcript and test score.\n\nDid any of you receive the link for document submission? Any guidance from reddit people would be highly helpful.",

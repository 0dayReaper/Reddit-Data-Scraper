I checked lately, and the notification is gone even though I sent nothing. Anybody know what happened, and if I should send my transcript? Maybe they got it automatically?\n\n[Before and After](https://imgur.com/a/N6Jwdxs)",

Yes, you will need to send your mid semester transcripts that show your fall semester grades and also your in progress courses for this spring semester. The reason for this to make sure that you took the classes you listed on your application and to also make sure you are still meeting the requirements for the conditional admission. If anything changes it also let the office of admissions know what your plans are. Hopefully this helps you out! :D\n\nEdit: As for the unexpected change to your my CSUEB, it does happen. The reason for that I never got to know but if you have anymore questions please feel free to ask the Welcome Center! They will guide you with any information that you may need!",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been itching to learn Python and was hoping some of you could guide me in picking the right class. It looks like CS 100 and 101 both teach Python - which should I choose? I'm a biochem major, and currently working in a laboratory. We use Python for some of our proprietary hardware. I'm familiar with inputting some very simple commands, but would like  amore in depth understanding of how to use this language for building programs, and communicating with existing platforms. I would consider myself rather tech savvy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "Apparently the difference between CS100 and CS101 is that CS100 is for people who are not majoring in the field while CS101 is for those who are. I believe both classes are fundamentally the same. \n\nI took CS101 and it covered the basics of python. In that course, you really could come in not knowing anything about python and learn basic principles to create a program. From the looks of the descriptions, both courses teach the same material. \n\nI'm not sure how strict they are letting \"non-majors\" take the CS101 course, but that's the one I can vouch for.",

            "comment": "If it's any help, I took CS100 and CS101 at Sonoma State. Both schools are CSU's so I'm assuming there's some overlap on how they categorize the classes.\n\nCS100 was like a generic history of computers, learning how to interpret binary, and introducing the ideas behind python (i.e. how a loop works, how a variable holds a value). It was like playing a computer game to learn how coding works and it happened to be in python.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCS101 was actual coding, completing projects, and writing scripts to complete tasks. You learn how to write different loops, write programs to sort a list, and generally more solid information if you wanted to learn to code.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck!",

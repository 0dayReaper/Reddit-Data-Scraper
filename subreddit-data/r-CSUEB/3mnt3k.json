    "postText": "Ok so I have a little scavenger hunt if anyone is game.  I'm a big fan of limited edition snack food and came upon a new Mtn Dew flavor called \"Mtn Dew Black Label\" that is only available at college campuses right now.  I'm in SF and no longer a college student, but am really curious about this new flavor.  Apparently it is being sold at the ARA@CSEB dinning commons (or so the Mtn Dew website says).  If anyone wants to make some easy money, find me at least one can of this drink and ship it to me.  I'll pay shipping and $10 via paypal or whatever you preferred method is.  Kinda a shot in the dark... who knows, if you are interested PM me!",

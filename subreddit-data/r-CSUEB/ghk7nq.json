    "postText": "I completely screwed up and realized tonight that I am without a doubt going to fail one of my classes required for my major. I placed myself on the waitlist for the summer course and got position 11. The waitlist for Fall was even longer.\n\nIs there any point in begging the professor for entry into the class, saying that if I don't retake this class it'll prevent me from being able to graduate on time? Otherwise, I'll have to pay for a semester just for the one class.\n\nI have no one else to blame for failing my class but myself. Even though I don't deserve any sympathy, please be nice if you can...I feel hopeless right now and can't even describe how much I wish I could crawl out of my skin.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice. Hope you all are fairing much better in your own classes.",

It goes without saying that I'm feeling panicked, so again thank you for the reassuring comment.\n\nGood luck with finals!!",

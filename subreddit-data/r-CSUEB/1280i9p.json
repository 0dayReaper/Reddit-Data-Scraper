Is this an accurate estimate? I could really use it, but I'm a little worried about getting my hopes up. Lol",

So I got the MCS for fall and spring of this year and that was after it was updated after an appeal. \n\nI received the same email and think it will be fairly accurate, but always plan on less than what it states. This way, if it drops you don\u2019t get bummed out as bad.",

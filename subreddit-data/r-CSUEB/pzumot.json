    "postText": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI want to go to CSUEB with a CS major. I want to ask you guys, that will I be able to find a job after graduating from CSUEB with a CS degree? How successful were you guys in finding jobs at tech companies after graduating with a CS degree from East Bay? \n\nThank you.",

            "comment": "Yes, I am an int\u2019l student, too. However the degree had little or nothing to do with it, and the job is not in tech. I ended up doing a mix of data science and computer vision for applications in biological research (without a single biology class in my life), I got this gig after volunteering at a research project during my 5th year, and it was 7 weeks between my graduation and gainful employment.\n\nHowever, out of my CS friends and classmates, the success rate isn\u2019t very high. IMO that\u2019s PARTIALLY their fault, because if there is a pretty low chance someone will tell you if CS is a wrong major for you or BABYSIT you and your education progress at East Bay.\n\nI should mention that the CS department is rapidly growing, with all the new labs and gear they have been getting. You absolutely MUST be involved with a faculty-mentored project of some kind (there\u2019s IEEE, CSR, some student-run clubs) and right now is a good time because things are actually getting funded. To get a job, you either know how to do real things, and have a faculty member that can back you up\u2026 OR you have a stellar resume (STEM center can help with that), 2000 LeetCode, and be able to annihilate an interview in every possible manner. Latter was impossible for me, so I went the first way.\n\nClasses by themselves will not have you \u201cinterview-ready\u201d, but pay close attention to Data Structures and Algorithms class (first upper-division) and Analysis of Algorithms (can be boring, but do your best to develop an intuition) - those classes have almost nothing to do with an average tech job but interview questions are ridiculously similar to what you get on exams there.\n\nTalk to an advisor about establishing a career track right away, as soon as you get to the school. Also, don\u2019t party through the undergrad and then wonder why you can\u2019t get into tech.\n\nTL;DR - get involved with faculty, then you might get a tech job. East Bay is not for those who want to just swim downstream and land a FAANG gig out the door.",

            "comment": "The degree will help but I have found experience is key. Most companies who hire new graduates are hiring graduates who have worked in the field while in college. Either as Interns, part-time, etc. You need a marketable portfolio or at least references from people in the field. Tech jobs value and often seek degree combined with experience. Use your summers to take temp jobs in tech or if you can work during school, take a part-time job in tech. Get the experience to compliment your degree to make finding a position in the tech world a little easier.",

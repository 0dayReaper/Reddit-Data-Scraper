    "postText": "Hi everyone first time posting here. My bro (incoming freshman) got an email claiming that he gets \"Free textbooks during your freshman year!\" And all he had to do was accept admission and register for fall 2020 classes. \n\n\nIt says that \"books required for your courses will automatically be shipped to you when you enroll in classes\". \n\nAny incoming freshman receive their textbooks yet? I'm wondering how close to the school start date the textbooks will arrive and if someone has that info that'll be really helpful! The school hasn't sent an update regarding this manner.",

I did part 2 of orientation and there was a video in there stating that required textbooks are ready by the first day of class. I emailed the bookstore about it but hasn't gotten any response yet. I'll comment again here if I hear from them.",

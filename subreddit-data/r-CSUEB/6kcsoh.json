    "postText": "Hi,\nI am a transfer student who is starting at CSUEB for Fall 2017. I know as of now I am only allowed to add 17 units for registration. I am wondering if when the semester starts I will be able to add more than 17? I am hoping to hear from fellow students who are attending or alumni that have graduated more recently. I am asking this because I currently have 14 units enrolled as of right now and want to add one more class but that makes it 18 units and the system will not let me.\nThank you!",

They should be able to help you out. \nKeep in mind that the counselor you should be speaking to is within your department, not a general advisor.\nGood luck!",

I'm not sure what major you have but for the college of science you either turn it into the college of science office or your department office. You can usually find the petitions in your department office. I'm not sure if directly talking to an adviser helps, some departments are really strict on if they will let you, so maybe that would be helpful.",

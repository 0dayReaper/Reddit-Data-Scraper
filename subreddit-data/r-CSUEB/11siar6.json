Be aware that you will spend a lot of time studying, form study groups and get to know your classmates.\n\n3. Talk to your counselor and talk to them at least twice a semester.\n\n4. Take advantage of all school resources and maybe join a club. \n\n5. Get involved as much as you can (but don\u2019t burn yourself out) \n\nI hope this helped and good luck !",

I assumed you only talk to them to change your major or if you\u2019re confused about what credits count where. I made it through my AA, transferring and now BS and only needed to talk to a counselor twice in 4 years.",

The meetings are only like 10 minutes long and they\u2019ve made me aware of some school resources. they also helped me make sure all my credits were counted ( i took classes at two community colleges) so i guess it really depends",

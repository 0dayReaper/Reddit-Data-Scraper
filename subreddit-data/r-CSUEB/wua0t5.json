At latest I belive Fall 2023 to be the full switch requirement. For the time being, however, teachers can use either or both platforms. Trust me, I have the same issue as my classes are split half and half and it's definitely frustrating.",

The conversion of materials last I heard is awful, and remaking a course for even the most tech savvy is extensive hours of work. If you aren\u2019t tech savvy, this transition is much needed. \n\nCanvas has a lot of cool things professors can utilize that they couldn\u2019t before on Blackboard, but it does require some HTML skill. \n\nThey can get away with basic \u201cblackboard\u201d template style, but the process is still different on Canvas to publish pages and materials. Please be patient with your professors. Everything takes time :)",

As previously stated in the comments, it's up to the professors right now to transition into it . I'm sure in the coming semesters using canvas will be mandatory for all classes.",

Alcohol okay.\n* No parties (obviously, invite your friends over for pizza and beer if you want, but let's try to keep it relatively quiet in general)\n* Friendly, Clean, Neat\n* Willing to split rent and utilities approximately evenly (obviously I'd pay pet rent/pet deposit)\n* Maybe you own a pet too, but it's a dog-friendly cat or a dog-friendly dog (hypoallergenic preferred but willing to discuss)\n\nPlease message me if you'd be interested. Maybe we can meet up, get to know each other, and try to get this thing done before school starts. I've been looking in hayward and Courtyard has a 2br/2ba open for $1525, which would be just a little over $750/apiece. Not bad, not bad, right?\n",

    "postText": "EDIT: I received a few more details after inquiring into the incident. I would love to hear from anyone else currently in the program or other incomings on what they think or how they plan to address the response during their time there. As for me, I'm very torn on whether to attend with the intention of being a voice against this sort of thing, or pull out and try again somewhere else next year. \n\nI am an incoming student into the School Counseling/MFT master's program, and I just received Dr.Pietrantoni's email discussing his decision to leave the university. Does anyone know the racist situation to which he is referring? Even though I really want to attend, I am considering pulling out of the program if it is something serious that is not being remedied.",

This is what was shared with me:\n\nThe situation occurred in a multicultural counseling course.  The instructor was trying to have a discussion about how to counsel a racist.\n\nOne of the students in the class (a school psych student), made some anti-Black comments.  The instructor perpetuated the anti-Black rhetoric.  The following week the instructor played ignorant to the situation and forced our Black students to share how they were hurt by the anti-Black rhetoric in front of the class.  A truly hurtful and shameful experience.  The department chair was made aware of the situation and his response was to have the instructor tell the students that he was not racist.  The department chair then went into the class the following week and shamed the students for not being more grateful for having the instructor teaching them.",

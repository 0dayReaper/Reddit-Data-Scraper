    "postText": "Hey! I'm a transfer student coming into Fall and I've signed up for classes today. I was able to get into my two other courses, except for my upper div course, BIOL-370 with Evans. It says it'll be online for Fall but I had to wait list. I went back to my class schedule though and saw it wasn't appearing so I can't see what number I am on the waitlist. I made sure that it shows wait listed classes, but still nothing. Did I do something wrong? Any help would be much appreciated, thanks!",

    "postText": "I was walking home from Proofs when I overheard this young college boy on a bike angrily yelling scolds into his phone. He was very rude and making up problems for the person on the other end. I do not like this boy; I keep walking. Young college boy finishes call.\n\nI walk and witness his friend yelling to him the instructions for a wheelie. I double took three times and had to ask \"is he going to to a wheelie?\", which friend replies \"no he's gonna fall\" and promotes the definite failure of the stunt.\n\nI decide that I will stay and watch and so did 2 more passerbys. The young college boy starts, fast, faster...towards some stairs? The boy bails into a bush next to the stairs, almost comically but also if he didn't he'd be have some serious injuries. We the passerbys are unimpressed; we did not see a stunt, we did not see an injury. We keep walking.\n\nMe and the passerbys exchange our confusion at the situation. Wheelies can be done in place, why did he speed up? Why did he speed up towards stairs? What exactly was he trying to do that he didn't do because he bailed?\n\nIn the end, it was worth it to stay and watch. However, it was not worth to be this young college boy's friend or to be this young college boy.",

    "postText": "I'm transferring from a community college to a CSU. I also got accepted into CSU East Bay to pursue a major in Biological Sciences. I'm also planning to minor in music. I was wondering if anyone could tell me more about the Biology programs, the music department, the culture, the campus lifestyle, what it's like living on campus or commuting, class sizes, Internship and Job opportunities, research opportunities, etc... How is the music scene at CSU East Bay? Is the counseling faculty accommodating? Are the music practice rooms open to any major?\n\nAny useful information; the pros and cons of CSU East Bay would be appreciated!",

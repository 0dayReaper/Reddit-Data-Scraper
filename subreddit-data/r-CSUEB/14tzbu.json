    "postText": "I'm transferring up from the Los Angeles area (English major) and know next to nothing about the area. Never even visited San Francisco. Anyone have any tips or advice for survival in Hayward? Interesting/unique places to check out, best parking spots, how to navigate BART, local music scene, farmer's markets... the list goes on. What is life in Hayward going to be like, basically? Anything helps. ",

            "comment": "Hayward's frankly not that nice of a place, but the downtown area is worth getting to know. The way to have the most fun is finding excuses to go into the city, or Berkeley and parts of Oakland as a runner up. BART can get you there pretty easily. If you have a car, then other parts of the bay are open to you as well, and you can have a great time up in the redwood-heavy parts of the North Bay.\n\nI was an English major, so if you have any more questions specific to that feel to free shoot me a PM.",

I'm mulling my options here and while it would be simpler to live on-campus (particularly since the parking situation seems to be nightmarish), the thought of having to share a bedroom is horrifying.

She sent in her housing app and fee in Dec when it first opened up. As a freshman, she'll have to share a room (I feel sorry for her future roommate(s)--we'll send in a search party).\n\nI shared a room at uni-- 4 of us in a 2-br flat. The wardrobes were arranged down the middle of the room so we had our privacy. It worked out well, better than the semester renting off-campus.\n\n",

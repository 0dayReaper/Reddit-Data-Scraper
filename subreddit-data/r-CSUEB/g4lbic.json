Like he would lecture and write down stuff on the board that we copy and then later email us that he made a mistake. I think if it was more planned out, it wouldn\u2019t confuse everyone. Also, he doesn\u2019t speak so loud so students in the back had difficulty in hearing. Other than that he\u2019s fine I guess.",

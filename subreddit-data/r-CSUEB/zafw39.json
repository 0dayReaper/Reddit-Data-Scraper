    "postText": "hello all, im transferring in spring 2023 and just had a quick question since payment is \"due\" on the 6th (yes i know, asking hella last minute haha) but basically in my student portal under account balance my charges are less than my Financial Aid Reward which is currently \"pending\" is there anything i have to do by the 6th or will i be okay with not sending any money out of pocket next week and the pending financial aid will cover the charges and deposits? thanks. \n\n\n\n  also.i read something about a promissory note, is that something i need filled out?. i never got something like that on my to do list",

Starting spring 23, got 3k in Pell grant and rest in unsubsidized loan. \n\nThey're supposed to be disbursed \"10 days before instruction starts\", so we still have a bit to wait. You don't need to do anything for the Pell grant but if you're taking out loans make sure you go through the FASFA signing process on their website. Otherwise it's just a waiting game. \n\nCongrats on the F.A. and good luck in school \ud83d\ude42",

I had to do 2 things.\n\n1. Loan Entrance Counseling (took about 15 minutes, it's modules with small quizzes)\n2. Sign a Master Promissory Note (internet signature)\n\nI'm surprised it didn't show up on your to-do list. The first one is for first time borrowers only but the 2nd one has to be signed every time you borrow otherwise it won't be sent. I'm going to the transfer orientation today on campus but if you want I can send you some screenshots later (after 5pm) or guide you through it if you're still struggling with it.",

So if it's completely covered you're good, but I learned when Fees came back last semester (basically serives on campus completely reopened) that you need to pay the remainder by Decemebr 6th I believe or you will have a hold and be at risk of being dropped. There's a specific way to do it, but it is necessary before financial aid processes",

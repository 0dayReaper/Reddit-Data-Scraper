I am probably going to go here due to cost and location but I was just wondering how it is, since I have an ADT for Math and an AS for CompSci from a community college here in Oakland. \n\nSo, how is the Computer Science program here in CSUEB?",

I just chose sfsu due to it ranking higher as well as it being in SF a lot of tech companies could come to campus to look for prospected interns",

I think you get out what you put in, but I\u2019ve been happy about most of my professors so far. \n\nThere are professors to avoid from what I\u2019ve been told, but that is true of every school. Data Structures and Algorithms has been a tough course but I\u2019ve found my professor to be approachable. \n\nSome classmates I\u2019ve spoken to who are further along the program mention that the classes are good and you learn quite a bit. They seem to be happy overall. \n\nOne complaint I\u2019ve heard though is that classes may not have you build enough projects for a portfolio. Or that classes like AI are more theoretical vs practical in their instruction. \n\nAnyways good luck! If you have more questions feel free to DM",

Professors are  boring always flex on you with their boring life stories about \" I used to work at Google or did this group thing etc\"  and doesn't want to help if you have a problem with a particular material he needs a good college either SF or SJSU",

The fact I don't have to wait until Fall 23 to transfer, can rush my B.S. degree in 1.5 years, have pell grant pay for full tuition, and it be only a 1 hr drive from home makes it 100% worth it regardless of how \"good\" the program is IMHO.\n\nHonestly though I always hear 2 extremes when it comes to their CS program. People either tell me they loved it (same people who graduated and got decent jobs) and others tell me it's the worse thing in the world. But I suspect the latter have a weird expectation of what a state school should offer. To me it's nothing more than a quick place to get a degree and move on to next step, be it a job or Masters program at a different/same school. Let's be clear, it's not a PhD program at MIT. lol",

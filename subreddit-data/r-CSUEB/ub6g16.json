If you need more guidance, speak to your CC transfer advisor/counselors and show them this. Hopefully they can help. \n\nThe admissions office of East Bay might be able to help you as well, but I don\u2019t know that for certain. But be your best advocate for you, and get the info you need. \n\nHope this helps!",

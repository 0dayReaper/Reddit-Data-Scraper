    "postText": "This is my second semester at East Bay. I have received all my aid for both semesters but I received an email saying my financial aid was being updated. The email subject read: Financial Aid Award Letter. I ignored it not thinking much of it since it seemed like the same as the one sent before fall semester. Come today I see a direct deposit of $4300 into my checking account. Should I be worried?",

    "postText": "Hi there! I\u2019m planning to be an incoming transfer student ~somewhere~ and one of the schools I got into was East Bay. I grew up in the bay and live in Oakland now so I know the area pretty well (well not as much Hayward), but would love to hear about people\u2019s experiences as transfers or just going in general! Thanks :) Also I\u2019m a PoliSci major, if that\u2019s important.",

            "comment": "Not sure where else you got in, but considering gas and bridge, it\u2019s a legit option since Oakland and CSUEB are both in the Eastbay. It\u2019s something to consider, especially if you plan to be on campus a lot. I got in to San Jose State and SF state, and although I live closer to SJSU, I chose EB for the program I\u2019m majoring in and the affordability. As a transfer student, I\u2019d say look into clubs and transfer support groups that you could identify with to establish connections. For example, as a transfer student I am part of PACE and EOP, and participate in events held by GANAS. Hope this helps!",

It\u2019s not overcrowded like sjsu so you get a lot of opportunities and attention from professors because of that which is good. The view and sunsets from campus are killer. The vibe is nice and people are nice. I would recommend it but it also depends on what your other options are",

            "comment": "My 2 cents:  For me, the computer version was way easier than the written version.  I Failed the written version because editing was way harder, my handwriting writing is borderline illegible, and i hadn't hand-written an essay for like 10 years.  The computer version was comparatively much easier.  In hindsight, i should have known this and started with the computer version.  Skip the handwritten test and sign up for the computer version test.",

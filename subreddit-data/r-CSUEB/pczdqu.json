    "postText": "It's called RippleMatch, which does the work in searching for a suitable job match for you. Unlike Handshake and Indeed, you don't need to spend hours looking and filling applications.\n\nIt was a relief for me during the summer and last spring semester. It takes five minutes to sign up, upload your resume, and receive job/internship opportunities quicker. You are interested, visit this link to get started:\n\nhttps://ripplematch.com/index?r=5ZWMJp\n\nFeel free to comment if you have questions or if you want to contact me directly, send me a private message.",

    "postText": "Hi. I am planning to transfer to CSUEB as I am in community college right now and have a few questions. \n\n1) I have a handful of Fs and Ws on my transcript. I repeated all those courses and recieved a B or A in them. However some, I had to retake more than once. Is this going to affect my application decision? It was around 4-5 Fs and 4 Ws\n\n2) If I wanted to apply for Spring 2022, when would decisions come out?\n\n3) Can I reapply for Fall 2022 if I get rejected for Spring? Or will the deadline for the application have a due date past the admission release date for Spring 2022\n\n4) Can I apply to both Fall and Spring?\n\nPlease answer as I tried googling all of these and I have not found any answers for the Spring semester, only fall &gt;\\_&lt;",

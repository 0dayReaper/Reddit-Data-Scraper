    "postText": "Hi I am a junior college sophomore looking to transfer to a 4 year college in the Fall of 2021.  Can anyone give me information about cal state east bay?  I live in the east bay walnut creek area.  How would the commute be and how is the faculty?  How is the campus and the social scene?  Any and all information is much appreciated!   PS:  I am also going to be majoring in Speech Pathology.",

            "comment": "Commute depends on the time of day. Mornings usually took me about 45 minutes from your area. Heading back is when traffic can get horrible. When I had classes that got out between 3 and 4 it would take over an hour to get home. Personally I love the campus and didn't mind the commute. I'm a health science major so can't help much with faculty but I've really enjoyed my time at east bay",

Would you recommend the college and how was the social atmosphere without living on campus.  I visited the campus a week ago for the first time and loved it.  I am just wondering what it is like to actually attend there with faculty and other students.",

I've been able to build amazing relationships with classmates. The campus is really diverse and a lot of people are bay area or California natives. I wasn't really involved in any extracurriculars but there are a ton of clubs to join. I have a few friends who are in ASI (associated students inc.) who plan the major events on campus and they love it. The events that I've gone to have been a lot of fun. If you have breaks in between classes there are a lot of places to hang out. East Bay was definitely my favorite campus out of all the schools I visited. I'm really happy with my choice to go there.",

You can also try to schedule classes around traffic. The best schedule for me traffic wise was starting at 11 and ending later on in the evening. The only possible downside to trying to only be on campus a few days a week is you might have long gaps between classes but I liked having that time to hang out with friends, study, work on assignments, etc.",

Social scene is what you make it. I just hung with classmates and a few of them are still good friends. If you can take most of your classes at concord, I\u2019d do that though. I wish they offered more classes for my major there",

I found it hard for me to make friends (I do have pretty bad social anxiety though) and didn\u2019t really extend myself to any clubs, groups, etc. but there are plenty at the school and people were generally friendly. I also transferred in as a junior, from an out of state community college and found the school to be populated with many other transfer students. I majored in computer science and thought the lecturers/professors to be about average. I took the majority (I think all, actually) of my GE classes online, which allowed me to only have to commute 2 days a week for the entire time I attended, apart from my last semester, when I needed a class that was only offered on Fridays (which didn\u2019t end up really mattering once we went remote due to COVID). Overall my experience at the school was great, staff are very helpful and want the students to succeed, and class schedules may allow you to have a limited commute if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.",

So you would say that there is a lot less traffic if you leave campus at 7PM? Are you a SLP now and did you go to grad school at CSUEB? How hard was it to find a good job with a degree from CSUEB and do you think it prepared you well for the career?\n\nAlso, do you have any advice for things for me to prepare and put on my resume? I would like to start doing things that make me stand out as a potential slp. I\u2019m currently an RBT 6-9 hours a week and also shadowed a SLP 2x. I feel like I have a lot of free time and want to spent it doing something useful for my future career!",

    "postText": "The housing practically refund close to nothing from what we pay for, There's no financial AID for international student at all, internships that wasn't even cancelled , now have to be ONLY Online? So if you have a internship that isn't canceled you can't even work because Cal State says it have to be online. AND flying back is prohibited? We pay so much international fees and none refund and just make things harder for us. Don't see why people should come to CSUEB to study anymore.",

I use Stanford materials.\n\nTry to find an internship and file for CPT/pre-completion OPT. Find off-campus housing, there are options available right now near the school. There are a few hardship scholarships available, check and search your horizon email. Look up resources provided by other schools.\n\nWorst-case scenario there are always options to find temporary employment if you find people who can help you handle legal part of things.",

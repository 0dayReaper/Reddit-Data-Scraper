            "comment": "Hi! I am currently enrolled in the BSBA online program. I choose the concentration in Information Technology Management. \n\nI love it! It\u2019s part of the \u201cself-service\u201d program they run. I\u2019m currently taking 18 credit units this semester and it doesn\u2019t feel like it at all...\n\nI\u2019ve had good and bad professors so far. Even though I had bad professors I was still able to get an A in the course. \n\nCounseling is kind of vague. You really have to be your own advocate and stay on top of the courses you need. I came from a university where I had to have a counseling meeting anytime I wanted to change up a single class on my schedule or drop it. It was miserable. I much prefer the freedom I get with CSUEB. \n\nI would recommend this program highly if you\u2019re a self starter! Good luck!",

I also like having the freedom but was a little worried on how intense the online classes may be, but it sounds like it\u2019s not too bad if you\u2019re taking 6 classes! You\u2019ll probably finish in less than a year and a half, right? I will definitely think about it some more. I wanted to \u201cminor\u201d in something as well, but being able to choose your own concentration is nice. I\u2019m thinking accounting.",

I\u2019ve found this program to be the easiest to work and finish up school. Yes, I should be able to graduate either this Fall 2021 or Spring 2022. I believe you have to choose a minor with this program! I might be wrong though. From what I\u2019ve heard the accounting minor is great. Also, the pace of the classes is really nice too. If you have any other questions let me know! I\u2019ve really enjoyed this program and I\u2019m super glad I found CSUEB!",

I was wondering if you could share any advice or some sort.\n\nSorry for messaging you out of the blue, I don't have many people to turn to and counseling is very broad.",

I invested in a paper planner and on Sundays I map out my week academically. I try to spend an hour each day on at least one course. It really breaks up procrastination and staying on top of my classes. \n\nFor example, yesterday I spent an hour working on my Ethic in Business course and finished my homework and module for the week. \n\nToday I will focus on my Decision Science course and go through this weeks module and exercise due this week. \n\nWednesday I will focus on business social responsibly class module for this week and discussion board. \n\nHopefully this makes sense! It has really worked for me. I take walking breaks in between studying. \n\nMake sure you also add in your planner times/days where you don\u2019t do anything academic. I usually like Thursdays as my \u201cbreak\u201d day where I will meal prep, watch TV, or just relax. It has made a huge difference scheduling out breaks and relaxing days. It\u2019s something to look forward to! \n\nAnother huge turning point is just being nice to yourself. Be kind when you turn in things late or miss that discussion board. It\u2019ll be okay. And you\u2019ll end up back on top. It just takes time and discipline! Don\u2019t be afraid to email your professors. I\u2019ve emailed two this semester already explaining I\u2019m still getting used to Blackboard when I accidentally mixed up some discussion boards. They were both incredibly helpful and nice. \n\nGood luck!!\n\nAlso, on mobile. Sorry for the the formatting and typos.",

ECON in general can be hard. I used a lot of YouTube videos to help guide me through Econ (mirco, macro, and agricultural econ). You can do it!!!",

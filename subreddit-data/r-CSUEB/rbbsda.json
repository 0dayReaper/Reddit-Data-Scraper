Other people have been warned, despite their financial aid that they would be dropped from classes for not paying early enough. This does effect low income students more as the ones most likely to need financial aid and then be dropped from classes before a schedule can be established. I've spent the first weeks of many semesters trying to ensure I had a full schedule so that I could graduate on time. The argument that someone is just irresponsible is ridiculous. People have other responsibilities and concerns sometimes that take precedence and cannot take the chance that they'll be out thousands of dollars of their own money. I know people that are still waiting on reimbursements from last Spring.",

Everyone has their own experiences and set of circumstances that makes each decision unique for them. If you don't want to sign the petition, then don't sign it. I'm not going to continue arguing with you about how different people make different decisions.",

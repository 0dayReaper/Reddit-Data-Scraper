All that matters is execution, which I am less hopeful for. \n\nI would've gladly taken the class, but how about we lighten the GE curriculum in the process? I don't need the state to mandate my participation in say, an art class, if it does not pertain to my major.\n\nMath, science, English, History. These are the only real classes that we can all certainly benefit from - regardless of academic concentration",

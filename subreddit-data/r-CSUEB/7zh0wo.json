    "postText": "Hey guys. \n\nI'm a graduation evaluator here at CSUEB. That means that I'm the one that will be going through all of your academic work to make sure you will have fulfilled the degree requirements. Once you've fulfilled them all, I will officially graduate you as well. \n\nIf you have any questions about fulfilling your requirements go ahead and post it here or send me a PM. If I don't know the answer, I'll figure out who can help you and let you know how to contact them. \n\nOnce important thing to keep in mind is that sadly, the different departments on campus are very separate and hardly ever talk to each other. This is super frustrating for both me and a lot of students because one department will tell them one thing, and then I'll tell them something different because the original department didn't document anything. \n\nAnyway, that's my spiel. Feel free to ask me questions. ",

However you can take some super easy classes to complete Area F.  KIN 3545: Competitive Conditioning (a 2 unit online fitness class), art classes (ceramics is a popular one), acting, dance, music performance, some speech/English/communication classes and the first aid class will give you Area F credit. An AACE advisor might be able to help you pick an easy class too!\n\nOh, and Area F in general is going to totally change in the Fall 2018 session when we switch to semesters. I don\u2019t remember specifics of what it will look like yet though... \ud83e\udd14\n\nHopefully that helps! ",

I\u2019ve been told that I need to send in a major check sheet, how do I do that? After sending that in, is that the last thing I need to do to be able to walk the stage? ",

                    "comment": "Hello! So you don't have to send in a major check. If you got an e-mail saying that the registrar doesn't have it, you have to go to your major department and bug them to send it to the registrar. Sadly the different departments don't communicate well at all and it usually lies on the student to pick up the pieces. \n\nAlso, not many people know this, but anyone for filed for graduation in the Fall 2017, Winter 2018, Spring 2018 and Summer 2018 session is able to participate in the graduation ceremony, regardless if you're actually graduating at the end of Spring. You will also not recieve your diploma at the ceremony. It will be mailed to you like six - eight weeks after a graduation evaluator officially graduates you. \n\nSo here is what happens when you apply for graduation through myCSUEB: \n\n1) It shows up on the registrars list as a graduation candidate for that session. The major then has to send the registrar a major check which tells us where you are at in your program. \n2) Once your graduation evaluator (determined by the first letter of your last name) receives your major check, they code it as \"pending\" in the system. \n3) Then a graduation evaluator will go through all the major checks they have (some faster than others) and e-mail each student with a sort of \"graduation status report\" to their horizon e-mail account.\n4) Once the official grades are posted for the session, the same graduation evaluator will go through their students and officially graduate those who have completed all major and GE requirements. Again, some faster than others. For those who haven't completed their degree requirements, their graduation term is moved to the next term and the process starts again. \n\nThat's a long winded answer, but it helps you and hopefully others understand the process of graduating. I don't know if there are mods on this subreddit, but maybe I can write up something that they can sticky for others, idk. \n\n",

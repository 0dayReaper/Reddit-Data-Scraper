I was wondering if anyone could share their thoughts on how's the program and whether it's actually meaningful for someone looking to get into the data science field.",

                    "comment": "There's a lot I can go on, but I can probably start by giving you suggestions on how to navigate the first semester (which can be challenging, but worth getting through).\n\n**MY THOUGHTS ON...**\n\n**Classes**\n\nYou'll be taking STAT 620 and STAT 630 (which are the first two courses in the MS Statistics program).  They provide a lot of the math and theoretical/applied foundations needed for the rest of the courses in the program.\n\nIf you're not too proficient in math, STAT 620 is a course that can be overwhelming since you get a very broad understanding of some of the concepts used in statistics (i.e. set theory, combinatorics, etc) and some Calculus will be involved (but not too frequently).  The course can be a little fast-paced at times, but as long as you read the textbook beforehand, ask questions in class, do the homework, and come to office hours whenever you can, you'll be able to get by.\n\nAs for STAT 630, that class is much more slower and not as intensive as STAT 620.  Some concepts may overlap with STAT 620, but it's fairly basic and doesn't assume you have a strong background in math.  You'll be doing a lot of R programming in this course (don't worry if you haven't coded before.  They'll walk you through it step-by-step).\n\n**Faculty**\n\nThe professors here are generally pretty helpful and friendly.  They're pretty open to questions in class and are supportive of you.  They're not too harsh since they know not everyone in the program is a statistics/math/cs major.  Plus, every month, the statistics department will constantly send emails updating you on new job or research opportunities related to statistics or data science so they do definitely care about your success and getting you a job after you graduate.\n\nTo be honest, I don't have much to say other than what I said above.  You could definitely look them up on ratemyprofessors, but keep in mind the reviews there are very skewed and may not reflect everyone.  So your experiences may differ from theirs.\n\n**Job Opportunities**\n\nIt really depends on what you find and make of your time in school.  The Statistics department here are pretty proactive in keeping you informed monthly about new job and research opportunities for you to apply to.\n\nOn top of that, CSU East Bay has an online job board through Handshake as well as online and in-person job fairs where you get to connect with and meet professionals from various different companies, such as Google and Intel.\n\nWhat I can tell is that regardless of the situation, it's important to NETWORK -  get to know your classmates, form study groups if you can and like, connect with your professors during office hours, ask questions, and most of all, explore your campus.  It doesn't hurt to have extra friends or connections wherever you go.\n\nAlso, there's the American Statistical Association that you could join (we have a chapter here on-campus) where when you get an ASA membership, you get access to a bigger job board specifically for statisticians and data scientists as well as resources for stats conferences, workshops, etc.\n\n**EXTRA SUGGESTIONS**\n\n\\- If you can, form study groups with your classmates not just for networking purposes, but also so you can learn together.  I find that I personally learn best when I'm working with other students (who can explain things differently, give me the opportunity to explain something again and again, etc).  Plus, you could potentially make some great friends here while in school.\n\n\\- If you can, look into being a  statistics teaching assistant during your second year in the Master's program.  It's a good way to make some money on the side and get some useful perks (i.e. faculty parking) while also being able to network with your professors, practice your communications and management skills, and give you the opportunity to review what you've learned (i.e. explaining the same concept multiple times helps to drill and commit the stats concepts you're learning and teaching to memory - good prep for the comprehensive exam).\n\n\\- Join the American Statistical Association student chapter on campus if you're looking to meet new friends, connect with students interested or majoring in statistics, and attend conferences/talks with local and national-level statisticians.  I'm currently an officer in the club at the moment so if you're interested, DM me.\n\n\\- Don't be afraid to ask questions in class and/or attend office hours in class.  I know people can be shy, but it helps you with learning as well as getting to know your fellow professors.  We're a community here and we all want you to do well and succeed.  \n\n\\- Look into extra resources outside of class to learn and practice R (a primary language we'll use to do much of the statistical analysis in).  Sure, the electives and courses you'll take will show you how to do certain things in R, but it can be basic at times (given how fast technology can change over time).  You can read more R-related or data science-related books on your own (which I can recommend if you don't know where to start), look for opportunities to do your own research project or work on someone else's (especially that of other professors), etc.  \n\n\\- As always, always keep learning, networking, and asking.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a pretty long post no doubt, but that's all I could think of.  If you have any additional questions, thoughts, or comments, feel free to let me know or DM me.  I'll be happy to answer them.",

So, I am looking forward to learn more from this university and the course. I would very much like to join the ASA student chapter, please let me know how to proceed with this. I will also DM you about the same.",

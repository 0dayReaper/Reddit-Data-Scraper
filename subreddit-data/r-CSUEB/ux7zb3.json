    "postText": "hello, im a CS major currently taking classes at Chabot, one of my classes isnt looking too good and was wondering if they'll revoke my admission for Fall 2022 if i fail that course since its a lower division CS course. i plan on taking it again if i fail it obviously but saw on the  East Bay course catalogue that i would be able to take some upper division courses that dont have that \"failed\" class as a Pre-Req. would i still be admitted and retake the course over the Fall?",

I had to put in a petition for admission since I wasn\u2019t able to take courses at my CC for spring and they were understanding and are allowing me to take summer courses and still be considered for Fall admission.",

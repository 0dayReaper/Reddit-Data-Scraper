    "postText": "Hey everyone. I'm a new student coming in as a freshman for the Fall 2020 semester. With quarantine and lock down going on I did a little searching around of online communities for students here at CSUEB, however I found very few. I figured if there weren't any communities already why not make one. I decided to make a discord server. It's meant for both established and incoming students. It's small for now but feel free to join and invite any other students you know of that may be interested.\n\n  [https://discord.gg/aCHUNQy](https://discord.gg/aCHUNQy)",

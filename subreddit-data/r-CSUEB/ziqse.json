    "postText": "Hello all. I'm transferring to Cal State East Bay from Colorado. Moving out there within the next few weeks, looking for any kind of advice on finding a job/place to live. I have two years residential paint/drywall experience. That's been my fall back for work, so I thought I'd mention it. Posting a similar message in the Denver subreddit got me the last place I stayed at for dirt cheap in exchange for paint/drywall/trim work so I thought I'd try my luck here!\n\nI'm going to school for philosophy now, will be switching to civil engineering next quarter, so I'd like to get a job in construction or something. I don't really need to be in Hayward, but decently close would be nice. I also love biking, boating, reading, going to shows (mostly rock), and partying/drinking so any suggestions on how to get hooked up with people for that stuff would be awesome. \n\nI haven't been to California since I was real little, so any info on cool spots to hang out/live/drink/work/whatever would really help out, cause EVERYTHING is going to be new to me.\n\nAny info on your lovely state would be greatly appreciated, Thanks!",

Haven't spoke to anyone yet, I'll probably call them Monday. I was trying to pay today but the damn site doesn't accept visa, AND they charge like $64. Going to pay with electronic check on Monday, which is the last day to pay according to an automatic call I got a week ago.\n\nI just signed up for 3 upper division classes in my major.

They've proven hit or miss too; they told me to just register for classes, any classes, until they figure my GE transcripts out. Ay caramba.",

            "comment": "I just graduated from the 2 year FT program and I will say that the program is currently undergoing some changes (allowing PT students, CA increasing the hours requirements for internship and how that will affect workload, etc) but I can speak on my own experience. Each semester, not including summer, we took 5-6 classes, usually Tuesday and Thursdays so you could do your internship M, W, and/or F. We had a couple of classes on a Monday night but you could still get your internship hours during the day. Over the summer, we had 3 classes but of course things looked different last summer because of Covid. Feel free to PM me if you have any follow-up questions! I'm happy to give any insight I can",

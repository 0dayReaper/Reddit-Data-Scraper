From what I have heard, a comp sci degree at CSUEB does not require two years of Physics with calc but at SFSU it does. I have a really hard time with physics and had to withdraw.\n\nDOo you rhink it is a bad idea to switch to CSUEB from SFSU for CS?",

You can't take the Quater roadmap anymore, you can only be grandfathered in. The Semester roadmap requires two courses of physics with calc.\n\nI don't know how the physics professors are here, but if you're thinking of transfering to avoid physics then you're a bit late.

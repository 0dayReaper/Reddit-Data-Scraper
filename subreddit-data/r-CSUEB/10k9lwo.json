I stopped them and told them the website said Monday the 23rd was the last day of grace. \n\nSo just know they are eager to give out tickets. It\u2019s more worth your while to buy the pass or daily permit. If you try to contest a ticket you need to have proof that you have a pass, and it is through the police department. It is a huge hassle. Do the math for how many days you will be on campus, and divide it with the cost of the permit. If it is less than the ten dollar day pass just take the hit and get it \ud83d\ude15 more worthwhile than 60$ tickets every time",

So the ticket is through the police/city just like any other parking ticket. However you are able to contest it though through the EB parking offices. \n\nWhen I was at chabot had to go in person to speak with an actual judge to contest a ticket! So they take it very seriously.",

I contested it though and they said I\u2019d get one waive, but I literally begged LOL \n\nI carpool with classmates to make it cheaper too so that\u2019s an option \ud83d\ude0a",

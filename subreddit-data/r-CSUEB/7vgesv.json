    "postText": "Hey all! I am a community college student born and raised in the Greater Los Angeles Area. I am transferring in the fall as an Environmental Science major and I am currently deciding between East Bay and Humboldt State as my future university. I have a few questions.\n\n-Do you regularly find yourself in San Francisco? It doesn't seem too far by BART. I am thinking if I go to CSUEB, I would commute to San Francisco often for entertainment and exploring. \nThe proximity to SF is one of the most appealing aspects of attending CSUEB for me. \n\n-Is it easy to find work around Hayward?\n\n-How is the science at CSUEB? Labs, professors, hands-on experience?\n\n-Is it easy to find housing around campus?\n\nThanks :)\n",

            "comment": "Yes, lots of SF stuff and Oakland too; it's probably my favorite thing about being here.\n\nWhen job searching it's best to expand beyond Hayward. As a stand alone city it's not too great, but it works better as part of the Bay (or just the East Bay). There's also on campus jobs and a website to find work through the school\n\nI'm in CS and it's not very challenging and kinda boring, but lots of extracurricular opportunity. Professors are great but great at the craft rather than the art of lecture. I've also had some physics majors approve of their degree program as well.\n\nHousing was a big thing when applying. The provided housing kinda sucks and is expensive, but you're more part of the campus community (by some means). The school also has an off campus housing Facebook page. Just gotta through some dice",

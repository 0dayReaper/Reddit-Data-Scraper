It\u2019s not free money but more like a short term loan with 0% interest. It\u2019s main idea is to help you be prepared by the first day of classes with books and basic supplies but you can use it on laptops and other items in the bookstore I believe. \n\nThe other voucher is a free $500 voucher that\u2019s more like a coupon for certain laptops. There\u2019s more stipulations to redeem this voucher, but it\u2019s money you don\u2019t pay back. \n\nI\u2019m not sure about combining vouchers and all that. You\u2019d have to speak to the bookstore about that.",

If you use the $500 book voucher; however much of it you use will be added to your student account and you will owe the school that amount. If you mistakenly use the wrong voucher, the book store can get it all squared away for you.",

The [device voucher](https://www.csueastbay.edu/students/academics-and-studying/fall-2022-device-voucher-rules-and-conditions.html) does not have to be paid back.  The other \"voucher\" is essentially a credit card (and has to be paid back).",

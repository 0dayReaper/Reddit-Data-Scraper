    "postText": "According to my schools website fall recess is November 21-25. Most of my classes are abiding by that also, other than one. This particular class is saying we\u2019re still meeting on Nov. 21 and 23 and that fall recess for her class is Nov 24-26. Can she do that? I mean it\u2019s an online class so it\u2019s not a huge deal to me, but it just doesn\u2019t seem right. TYIA",

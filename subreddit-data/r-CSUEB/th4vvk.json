And still do occasionally.\n\nGreek life is obviously dumb and dramatic (ngl I avoided partaking in greek activities), but you get a chance to see big functions happening off campus and also make friends, which isn\u2019t easy at a commuter school.\n\nThere\u2019s a variety of orgs to join depending on what your priorities are. Also you are free to leave any time and pursue your own thing later on. I can give you my take on greek life and orgs in dms.",

How do you guys feel about not have a ceremony?  \n\nTransitioning from in-person to online for some professors , I feel like they\u2019re having a hard time. It sucks that for one class I can\u2019t get a zoom meeting it\u2019s prerecorded. Kinda shitty not to have a ceremony but oh well. Hopefully they let us take summer classes all online instead of in person so we can work internships and not waste another semester if you need to finish a class or two to graduate. Anyways just wanted to pick peoples brains see what y\u2019all feel about this whole situation. Just rambling lol",

I made plans to go out to dinner with them at the end of the sem, but who knows if I\u2019ll see them by May. I\u2019m super distracted at home, if I\u2019m not required to do something, I will put it off. I feel sad because graduation is a social construct that I feel I\u2019m being \u201crobbed of.\u201d Lol. But maybe we\u2019ll have a ceremony in the summer, idk. \nI hope you\u2019re doing ok though, we will get thru this semester :c",

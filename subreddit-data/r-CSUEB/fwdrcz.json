            "comment": "Hi there, I\u2019ll try to answer all\n\n1) upper division I believe should be take 3rd or 4th year but I think you can do it before too. \n\n2) stat 110 seems to be the only class at night if that\u2019s what is listed. I think stat 100 can be taken too instead. \n\n3) business law is required. If you take a look at the catalog for business major, it will be listed there. \n\n4) honestly, for B1, I\u2019d say choose any of the ENSC or geology courses assuming you won\u2019t wanna take and chemistry or physics. Intro to chemistry for me was pretty easy in my opinion. Even elementary physics may be a good choice. \nFor B3, is about the same like b1. I actually loved anatomy and physiology since I used to be pre-nursing major but didn\u2019t like bedside nursing so I switched. I\u2019d say take a geology course like oceanography and then elementary physics.\n\nLet me know if you have anymore questions. I\u2019d be happy to help you out.",

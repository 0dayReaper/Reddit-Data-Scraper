I chose Finance as my concentration.\n \nHow do you like it?\nDo you work full time? If so, how many classes do you take?\nPros and cons of the program so far? \nAny additional information is much appreciated!",

            "comment": "I was going to transfer last fall with 90 units to CSUN but with the pandemic and realizing how unprepared instructors and administration were to go online I jumped into the Online BSBA program at CSUEB in the spring instead. \n\nIt was the best decision, get all the perks of a cal state, no fixed schedule for lectures and it\u2019s very interesting practical experience to work virtually with my fellow students -most in the Bay Area but some in other states. \n\nTaking 18 units now but it feels like 9 and have two internships lined up already for summer and winter. I\u2019m finishing almost all the core business this semester, enrolled in two UDGE in the summer and plan to only take my Accounting concentration courses in the Fall, Winter and Spring. I\u2019ll be preparing all along for my 1st of attempt at the CPA exam next June.",

By working virtually with classmates do you mean you hop on a lot of zoom meetings? Or is it more at your own pace? Pretty nervous of going into accounting, but I think I\u2019m going to do it!",

The business core classes are easier than expected but I\u2019m leaving the heavy (may not be so easy) toward the end of school since I plan to take the CPA exam shortly after Spring semester is over next year so that it\u2019s still -somewhat, fresh. \nWorking virtually does involve some Zoom meetings but also apps like Adobe Creative cloud, GroupMe, File sharing (Google Docs and Microsoft Suite), Online discussion boards, and a fair amount of emails. Two projects I\u2019m currently collaborating on are an E-magazine (Team Communication) and an Infographic (Marketing) both involve about 8 students working (5,3) together across the country. \nIf you notice in the School Catalog the B.S.B.A is technically only 120 units, I completed an accounting certificate program before I completed my A.S.-Transfer so I plan to finish both my B.S and the 150 unit requirements by only completing 66 units at CSUEB. There\u2019s 3 UD-GE that are a graduation requirement but your business core only accounts for 1 of them so even after 120 completed units (core + concentration) some people may not be eligible to graduate or take the CPA exam. For some the extra 36 units is an entire extra year which can add to the complexity of the Accounting concentration. Keep up on the total # of units and frequently check in with a counselor. \nRemember the 150 units (in most of the US) entails 3 elements  1. A bachelor\u2019s degree, 2. 24 \u201cbusiness\u201d units, 3. 24 \u201caccounting\u201d units. While at a JC I found a lot of business majors that\u2019s had a concentration in other subjects and had completed their degree; return to only complete \u201caccounting\u201d type courses at a lower cost. So it all depends on how you want to use your degree and what your timeline looks like.",

I\u2019m finishing my lower division business core requirements now at a community college (the 18 units needed before enrolling in the business program). I already completed the transfer requirements as well. It was my understanding that I would just be needing to do 60 units at CSUEB (the 30 units for upper division business, the 27 units for the required accounting courses, and the extra 3 unit class that is recommended for students taking the CPA). Thanks for bringing this to my attention btw,  I will def reach out to a counselor this week! Now that the deadline is getting closer I want to be on top of everything.",

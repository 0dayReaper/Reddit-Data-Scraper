I know you guys probably don't care but signing this petition to help us get the word out that CSULB doesn't properly congratulate their students is very important and we would appreciate your guys' signature. We've seen photos of your guys' school graduation ceremony and thought it was beautiful and we want to be able to have the same experience. Your guys' help would mean so much.\n\n[https://www.change.org/p/let-csulb-s-class-of-2023-walk-at-graduation?source\\_location=search](https://www.change.org/p/let-csulb-s-class-of-2023-walk-at-graduation?source_location=search)",

This is why I don't go to commencement at East Bay, I feel such dismay seeing so many students leave the ceremony once they have their moment on the stage, without regard for everyone else. The last 1/4 of the ceremony is just empty and depressing for the students who are left.",

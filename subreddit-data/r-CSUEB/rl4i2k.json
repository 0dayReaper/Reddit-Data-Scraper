Not sure you\u2019re ideal school and work schedule, classes are bit hard to get into if you\u2019re not quick about it and need it to be a certain time. Other than that, it\u2019s been pretty smoothly sailing. \n\nAs someone else said def rec. Prof Ross, he loves to talk but his classes are pretty straight forward.",

Maybe how much your study habits had to change to accommodate for the change in difficulty? Also how\u2019re the professors here? Accessible? Supportive? I\u2019ll be in the department of statistics. Thank you so much!",

I\u2019m entering my 2nd year in the Counseling program (MFT), and I found the workload to be manageable but definitely time consuming (a great deal of reading). The papers weren\u2019t too intense in my opinion, but I know others in my cohort felt differently. Honestly, it\u2019s been less intense than I anticipated, but definitely not a cake walk by any means. The admin side has been a shit show, but every department has different directors, so it\u2019s going to be a different experience depending on the program. Hopefully your program director isn\u2019t stretched too thin and is on top of things\u2014 ours is unfortunately the exact opposite and that has been the most difficult aspect for me. A lot of things falling through the cracks, last minute notices of big changes, and general confusion and lack of guidance. The professors for the most part have been fantastic.",

We literally have to email/text our director multiple times to get help with time sensitive issues like needing her to sign paperwork for our traineeship placements. It\u2019s been rough but if I had to do it over again, I\u2019d still go with this program. The curriculum, professors, and cost work for me (one of the least expensive masters programs I was able to find).",

            "comment": "I just finished the MS for business analytics in May. The program focuses around data visualization and tools for analysis using python and R. The final project was a semester-long capstone project in the last semester to demonstrate different modeling techniques learned through the course of the program. \nI did the program in two years as a part time student for all semesters except the first. I held down a full time job while simultaneously working towards the degree. I did the first year pre-covid and the second year during covid. I was more engaged in the program prior to the pandemic since it was in person and I got to interact with classmates. The program is fairly new so the curriculum still needs to be ironed out IMO. There weren\u2019t many real life examples scenarios. All course work was just snippets of surface information. In 2020 the program became very relaxed. The capstone became a group project and you had to pick a pre-determined topic. Pre-covid it was individual projects and you worked with a professor to get feedback. \n\nWas it harder than undergrad? Not really. If you have good study habits and time management skills then you will be ok. I noticed that professors would go through materials quicker and they would expect you review materials ahead of class. Professors may hold you to a higher standard or think you should already know something. If you ask for help though, they\u2019ll accommodate. You get what you put into it. All professors (except for one) was very supportive when asking for help. \n\nOne noticeable difference from undergrad to grad school: your classmates. I felt dumb sometimes compared to my classmates. Grad students have more variance in age, experience, and background. Most were working professionals in my program. I joined the program to break into the field. Some had been in the field for 5+ years. \n\nOf course it\u2019s what you make of it. I stopped paying attention and would do the bare minimum once we went virtual. In the end I feel like I wasted money and didn\u2019t as much networking opportunities or concrete skills from it. \n\nGood luck!",

I had two classes that were 1-5pm and my job was luckily accommodating. \n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about meeting times, you can probably find an online catalog of all classes. For the classes you need, you can see what time they\u2019ve met historically. Example: if you need MATH 300 your first semester, look at the Fall  2018, 2019, and 2021 catalogs to see what days and times those classes are usually offered.",

            "comment": "In grad stats and grad in general classes are more intensive so units in grad classes are more weighted than in undergrad. You take fewer classes but more effort. Grad programs focus mostly on the subject with really no general Ed. Full time grad student cannot have a full time job and not struggle badly.",

Fortunately, I only have 1 class left but I left the US to go back to France in March since my classes went online. \n\nWhat do I do now? Am I barred from going back to the US? Flying now is difficult and the US is badly hit with COVID. \n\nI know I can\u2019t do multiple online classes. If I did, would it have impacted me?\n\nMy girlfriend is from Korea",

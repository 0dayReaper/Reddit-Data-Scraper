    "postText": "Credential Program: If you\u2019re enrolled at CSUEB Hayward or live near the Hayward campus I know of a residency program nearby. You\u2019re in the mentor teacher\u2019s classroom the whole school year half time (Mon-Thu), receive a stipend, and are required to work in the district for 3 years (they will offer you a job). If you do not work for 3 years you have to pay back the stipend (depending on how long you\u2019ve worked).\n\nThe induction program is also included in it and you receive a stipend after completing the second year. Not all districts provide an induction program at no cost. There are others where you have to pay for it.\n\nThere is still space and time left to apply. Comment or message me if you\u2019re interested. \n\nThis is a 3rd option since the others are the traditional route or intern route.\n\nSingle, multiple, and I think special education since they match by credential type.",

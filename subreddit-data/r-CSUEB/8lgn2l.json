I have been admitted into both but at sjsu I am entering as a civil engineer and would need to change majors which is a gamble and not guaranteed as oppose to CSUEB I am in Computer engineering already. Any input, arguments, recommendations?",

I am finishing up some classes now and going to meet with the director of Engineering and Software Engineering advisor at SJSU before the semester starts to see what my chances are if I apply for a Change of Major. I really want to do software engineering and enter the hot market, I do have a passion for this and find it very interesting. CSUEB only offers Computer Engineering or Computer Science, which I have talked to the advisor and have good chances of transferring before starting. At SJSU, I am entering as a civil engineer, and want to enter their software engineering program.",

I see the amount when I go to account balance but it hasn't officially paid off the \\~3.5k charges yet (just shows as pending with total due $0).\n\nFirst time i'm receiving F.A. (or attending CSUEB), so i'm curious about this too.",

In there you can see the financial aid ylu are given per semester. For this  fall semester it shows what i got but not for next semester.",

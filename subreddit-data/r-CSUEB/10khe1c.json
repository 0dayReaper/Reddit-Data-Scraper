If still eligible, you will get an email saying you are and then the money will be disbursed. This is frustrating because I am in good standing and on the csac website it says I am awarded. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the same case for you, regardless the person I spoke to told me I could reach out to csac because she didn\u2019t have an answer for one of my questions. Sigh",

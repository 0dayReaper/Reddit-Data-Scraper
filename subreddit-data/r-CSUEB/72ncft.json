The facilities seem outdated in comparison, no 24 hour study lounge, limited food selection and it sucks.  At Sac, they give you $10 on your card every semester to print, I guess they don't do that here.  Can you reserve rooms for group study sessions and projects?  I just went to the library and all they have are these old cramped rickety cubby holes?  Where is your favorite place to study?",

Unfortunately the library closes super early (like, ten or so). The first floor of the library has study tables, but for some reason people are always chatting away down there so it's not the best place to go.\n\n",

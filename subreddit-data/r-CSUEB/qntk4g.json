    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI just wanted to ask that the csu application opens from October 1 to November 30, I wanted to apply for csueb for CS. I will apply in November, and CSUEB has a policy of rolling admissions, which means first come first serve, so people who applied in October will be the ones who get their application reviewed first. However, i will apply in November, so does that mean will my application be overlooked, or will someone else who applied before me will get my spot because it\u2019s a first come first serve, so will I be denied at csueb because all the students who applied first filled all the slots. I am applying for CS with the having the Golden four, all the course requirements completed, and I have a 3.26 gpa, so will my application be overlooked because all other applicants who applied before me got all the slots. I will apply between November 5 to November. I\u2019m just really worried that I might get denied because all the applicants that applied before got my spot. Any insight or information would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you.",

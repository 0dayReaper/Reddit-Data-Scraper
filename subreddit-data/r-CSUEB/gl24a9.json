I\u2019m not sure which labs for what classes will be on campus. Of course I think it will be limited because of social distancing. Hopefully it\u2019s all online though cuz I wouldn\u2019t wanna go to campus and be around people.",

Only essential labs will have limited enrollment like for nursing students or even for some bio labs that are essential. With the keyword being \u201cessential\u201d. There are articles posted just recently about this since I think it said it was about 23 CSU\u2019s closing completely with the exception of necessary labs for nursing students and some bio labs. There will be restrictions so it can be safe for everyone. LA Times posted, CBS posted. I even saw a link on reddit toward another article talking about it.",

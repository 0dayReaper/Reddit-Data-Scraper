I didn\u2019t take the necessary trig class to progress to precal then calculus. But I did take everything else to be able to take APPLIED CALCULUS this summer. I looked up the agreement with Chabot and CSUEB and it Saids I could take applied calculus. Again this will be something I will bring up with my counselor . But did any of you take applied calculus and that qualified ?",

You can take calculus which is math 130 like I did, only if you\u2019re minoring in an applied field like math or Cs or something. I\u2019m minoring in stats which is why I opted for calculus, otherwise I\u2019d have taken business Calc.\n\nSome schools do require actual calculus but not CSUEB. You can choose between calculus or business calculus for business majors.",

Applied calculas is perfectly fine to take for anyone transferring for a business major to csueb.

But if you don\u2019t mind taking calculus or applied calculus, then go for it. Good luck!",

They\u2019ve been continually moving the needle on fall aid disbursement month after month and now my damn student loan is late being applied to my account. Just WTF is going on over there? Last semester over aid still not disbursed. Current semester aid not on time. I was mis-advised twice and last semester I had to get two grades changed because they were incorrect. Leaves me wondering what I\u2019m paying for since I\u2019m doing all the work it sure seems like. Before last semester everything was going smoothly but it sure as hell has derailed since then. Extremely unhappy with this place at the moment. Thank god I graduate in may. Allegedly.",

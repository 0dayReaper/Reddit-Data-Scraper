    "postText": " \n\nHello Everyone,\n\nI am a transfer student from a California community college, looking to transfer to a CSU in fall 2022. I applied in November to CSU East Bay. I had a question regarding my transcript, On my application I did enter everything but the courses are not in the sequential order like they appear on my transcript. I do have all the courses that are on my transcript but they are not in the sequence of my transcript.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s consider spring 2020\n\nOn my transcript for spring 2020 it shows:\n\nArt 103C = 4 units = A grade\n\nEnglish 101C = 3 units = A grade\n\nPre calculus ll = 4 units = B grade\n\nGeography 104 = 3 units = A grade\n\nNow on the CSU application I didn\u2019t put them in the same order as my transcript:\n\nI put:\n\nEnglish 101C = 3 units = A grade\n\nGeography 104 = 3 units = A grade\n\nArt 103C = 4 units = A grade\n\nPre calculus = 4 Units = B grade\n\nso the courses are not in order but they are all there on my csu application. I want to know how that will impact my admissions? If I dont have the courses in sequence. Is this something that I should worry about?\n\nThank you.",

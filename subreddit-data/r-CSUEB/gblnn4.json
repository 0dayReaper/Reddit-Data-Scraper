    "postText": "Hello, everyone. I am currently finishing my last semester at community college. I have a couple of questions regarding waitlisted courses and overlay requirements.\n\nFirst, I have never once been waitlisted for a class, but this coming fall semester I am unfortunately on a waitlist. Can someone please explain how the waitlisting process works at CSUEB? Do students have to pay for the waitlisted course before or after they officially get a spot to enroll in the course?\n\nThank you in advance!",

There is the tuition price if you are a part-time student and there is a tuition price if you are a full-time student. So unless the class you are waitlisted for will bump you up to full-time status you will not be paying more for the class.",

I currently work for old tech (think IBM, Intel, etc..). Now that I'm nearing 1 year in the industry I'm getting messages from recruiters from startups to FAANG. So I have onsites with them lined up for later this year. It's not so much about the school but how well you can leetcode, interview, and experience.",

    "postText": "Hello,\nI wasn't able to get a clear answer from emailing so I've come to ask questions here.\nI'm currently at my CC looking to complete my Business Admin ADT in the summer and transfer for Spring 2021. My question(s) is,\n\nHow is the online BSBA program in general?\n\nIs it more rigorous online than on-campus?\n\nDo I need to take a Business Calculus class for the upper divisions, even though my ADT doesn't require it? \n\nCan I still enter &amp; graduate from the program without the calculus course? \n\nThanks",

            "comment": "Hi there, \n\nI transferred from DeAnza with my ADT degree into the BSBA online program last fall. To answer your questions:\n\nI honestly feel like the classes are way easier than some of the classes I\u2019ve taken online at a CC. With that being said there aren\u2019t a lot of options in terms of variety of professors teaching the same courses. You\u2019ll get offered one or maybe two different professors teaching the course. \n\nAs for business calculus, I completed my class at CC in person. I highly recommend taking this class in person at a CC. I found the class challenging even with a good teacher. Also it\u2019ll save you some $$. Costs run at about ~$1100-1200 per/class because tuition is slightly higher for the online program. \n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to PM me.",

I've yet to complete the Business Calc class required for transfer, I'm in a weird situation and I'm trying to clear it up. I may come back to this post and ask questions at random times if that's ok with you.",

At first, I was thinking of taking 3 courses per semester, and 1 in the summer, but I was wondering if taking 4 courses at a time would be too much, I'm not too bright of a student and like to take things slower, I'm barely getting by my lower divisions at my CC, and I imagine that I probably wouldn't fare too well in the upper-divs if I took too many courses at a time.",

I work a full time job and 3 is probably the max I can manage while maintaining good grades. I was never a good student through community college, however I do find upper-divs class a little easier than classes in CC. Also, now that I\u2019m paying for school I don\u2019t want to waste money on a work load that I know I can\u2019t manage. \n\nP.s.- Don\u2019t sweat about taking your time go at your own pace. No matter what other people may think. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the destination it\u2019s the journey...\u201d -K. Bryant",

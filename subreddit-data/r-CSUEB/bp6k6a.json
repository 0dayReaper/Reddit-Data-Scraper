For the school of engineering, there is a pattern of classes that alternate fall to spring, and electives that might come around once every 3 or 4 terms. The catalog website shows all available classes in the department, not necessarily what is being offered in the upcoming term.\n\nBut GE classes do seem to be offered pretty regularly",

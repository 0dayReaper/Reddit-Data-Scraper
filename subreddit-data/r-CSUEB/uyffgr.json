    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am admitted to the masters in Stat concentration in Data Science course for FALL22, as i am an international student i have also started the visa process. But recently I have got an admit into UNT major in Data Engineering and I like this subject/domain better and want to pursue my career in this domain. I just want to know from a CSUEB student's POV which would be better. I know that the place is a huge advantage in CSUEB and i can learn about the data engineering tools/subject side by side to my course. but if there is any other downside to csueb i want to reconsider. Any feedback on this is much appreciated.",

There are no downside to csueb I loved it, the staff is great the professors (most of them as with any university there are some bad apples) were great for the most part so it really just comes down to your preference in which major you want to pursue!",

The views from campus are killer which helps when things get stressful lol only downside to location is that it\u2019s on a mountain and you have to drive down for places to eat other than that it\u2019s great!",

Unfortunately COL is higher. At least Texas has Austin which is becoming a financial hub. However Texas also has a lot of guns, so\u2026",

A lot of tech companies support international employees with visa help. You\u2019re also more likely to find a community at CSUEB that\u2019s from your country. \n\nI\u2019m not hating on Texas, but as a white woman, I would never go to school there. \n\nOh yeah. If you\u2019re female, Texas is about to make your life a lot harder. California supports your rights and has options for everyone.",

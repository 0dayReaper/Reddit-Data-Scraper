I feel like I don\u2019t belong at CSUEB or any college at all. I seem to be seeking ventures in entrepreneurial fields vs contemporary ones that need a degree. At this point, I feel like school is a waste of time/money.  I also feel forced to graduate just to make my parents proud (immigrants) since that is their only hopes and dreams for me. \n\nAnyone else in a similar situation?",

I was taking full time (18 units) courses at DVC last year - while working full time and having kids. I\u2019m terrified to start at CSU in fall 2020 because I know that university is going to be worse than community college in terms of workload and I was struggling with CC. My transfer GPA is 3.77 so it\u2019s not like I was just pulling subpar grades to get through.\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult. I know it\u2019s hard to predict your future, but if you think you are going to want to finish someday, do it NOW. It is easier now than doing it when you\u2019re in a situation like mine. I had my oldest kid when I was 16 so I never had the opportunity to go to college without the burden of these types of responsibilities. In my situation, I\u2019m getting my BS strictly because it\u2019s required to me to advance in my current career field. Otherwise I had only ever planned on an AS. So you just never know what your future will look like and since you\u2019re already halfway done, it\u2019s probably best that you push though.\n\nHave you considered changing majors?",

Huge props to you and making the decision to take it to the next step.  \n\nIn my shoes right now, I just don\u2019t have a sense of direction. I feel that without a direction, there is no burning will or desire to push yourself and this is the boat I find myself on. I have considered changing majors but haven\u2019t looked much into it.\nMaybe those are my next steps and truly exploring what is out there and deciding what it is I actually enjoy doing. \n\nParticularly my current concentration is in marketing but all the content taught at school is so outdated and therefore irrelevant to some point. I like the concept of marketing, but school really doesn\u2019t capture the entire scope of it besides the mere fundamental principles theories. \n\nMay I ask? \nHow do you view a degree: As a piece of paper in completion on the wall or as an accurate representation of education? \n\nIve always been a top student, but maybe school isn\u2019t for me? Everything about it makes me question it. I know most if not all do not like school, but sometimes I see school as a scam. \nBut at the same time, as bad as a degree is as a scam to me, it can provide up to some degree of life insurance later. For ex) if nothing of my independent ventures work out, at least I can leverage with my degree and get a job. In that case I don\u2019t fall completely out of luck and I still have something to fall on.",

I work for a local government (city) in IT.\n\nI make decent money; I do not need to get my degree and would be content staying where I am. But it was a struggle - I started at 17 working for my dad, then when his company went under, I worked retail. Eventually I got into a grocery store (still retail but better pay) and worked my way up through that company into the administrative side rather than the retail side. I worked these low paying IT jobs for 10+ years before getting into public sector, which still doesn\u2019t have great pay but the benefits are worth it. Low paying by Bay Area standards obviously, it would\u2019ve been decent pay anywhere else.\n\nThen I realized that while I am content, if I wanted to go any further, it was required that I get my BS. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s literally a formality. I even told my DVC counselor exactly that. I\u2019m not even getting my degree in the field that I work in, because I need a hybrid or online program since I work, and computer programs are oddly not really offered in that format; very few of them and mostly programming which is not my thing. So my degree at CC is Administration of Justice and I applied for a Sociology program at CSU. And I work in IT. I do love sociology and anthropology so at least I\u2019m enjoying it but it\u2019s still a formality, period.\n\nSo I can totally see where you are coming from!! And honestly, your situation is different - you don\u2019t have kids. So you can have roommates, move where you want, live out of your car or travel around towing a little travel trailer and live out of that, explore the country or world, work multiple jobs if you want, basically live how you want without considering another human being like I\u2019ve had to for almost 18 years (my oldest will be 18 in about 6 weeks).\n\nBut your last paragraph is exactly why I would push through, especially since you\u2019re halfway done. You may regret it in 10 years; but if you finish up, you can still pursue what you want and have that safety net piece of paper without having to do it when you\u2019re old like me :) Maybe, can you take a break for a few years without penalty? (Unsure how that works)",

Push your self a little harder everyday.  Take it day by day but keep your eye on that long-term goal, you know what it is.  Don't think about school as something you do for your family or others, but do it for your own self.  Reach out for help at school if you need. There are plenty of resource available.\n\nAs an immigrant myself, I totally understand what it's like being \"behind\" other people who were born here.  Your parents probably want you to finish school because they understand how important education is for you, not just to get a good career but be well educated also.",

    "postText": "Hey r/csueb. \n\nNoticed that CSUEB offers one of the four industrial engineering programs in the Cal State system, with the other three coming from SLO, Pomona, and San Jose. These schools don't accept second bachelor's degree students like myself, but it seems that EB does. \n\nI really have no interest in any other type of engineering other than industrial engineering as I'm very fascinated by it, and I would jump on this in a heartbeat, but I live in OC, and I wonder if you guys and gals would recommend the program despite the distance? Thank you.",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\n\u200b\n\nSo I was looking at my account activity this morning and noticed that I just received a refund from financial aid for the amounts of loans from both my winter and spring quarters at CSUEB.  I'm a bit confused as if these \"Fin Aid Refunds\" are actually the loans that I have to pay back?  I checked my Federal student aid account and it doesn't say that I owe any money on loans nor does my CSUEB account say I owe payment on any loans.  I also checked my charges due, and it also says I don't owe anything there.  I'm just confused as to whether or not I will owe money on these refunds or if CSUEB somehow messed up and gave me free money or really just, what happened and why I was given a refund for a loan I never took out nor signed a promissory note for?\n\n\u200b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kxt52hbjfqi11.png?width=562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e303e79400f86228b8b1e8fd131d9dbb1369c365\n\n\u200b",

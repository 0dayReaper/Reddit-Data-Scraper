    "postText": "Hello, So I am considering transferring to East bay for computer science. I have a couple of questions, as I am torn between this school and Cal state monterey bay\n\n1. Hows the social scene here? Is there a dating culture or is it quite reserved?\n2. I am a computer science major, and looking to work full time or part time while attending, more specifically within the tech field. I am assuming the job opportunities are abundant since SF doesn't seem far away, is that safe to say?\n\n3. Coming from Los Angeles, what would you say is the best living situation for this school? I know it is like a commuter college; would renting out an APT with/without roommates be optimal and what cities surrounding should I been looking towards. I have reliable transportation and don't mind driving.",

            "comment": "1. perhaps i'm a social loser and just go to class and go back home because none of my OG friends go there and i never really stay on campus for anything, but yeah i think its a very reserved place and you only really talk to the people you already know\n\n2. there are lots of opportunities but there are also lots of people searching for them as well. i failed at compsci and moved to the health field, so if you've made it this far to wonder about transferring i can't really tell you about the program itself but i wouldn't recommend committing all the way to SF on bart if you live near campus. it'll be a pain every day and lots of time will be wasted\n\n3. if you can afford to live with roommates in an apartment then i guess i'd recommend that. i think you should also consider staying in or near LA and stay at home if you can. it isn't really worth traveling this far to come to such an uninspiring school lol.",

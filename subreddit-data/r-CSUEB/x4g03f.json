    "postText": "Hey guys, I am currently a third year computer engineering student at San Francisco State University and I am considering transferring to Cal State East Bay. The main reason for this is because I personally live far from the SFSU campus and having to commute 5 days a week is too grueling. I spent the last two years online and am now considering transferring to a CSU that\u2019s closer to me, but I would like some information because I\u2019ve heard that if you\u2019re a student who has taken upper division courses (which I haven\u2019t yet), then you might have to retake them once you transfer. I would also like to know about the computer engineering at CSUEB and how it is overall. Thanks so much for taking the time to answer my questions.",

            "comment": "How far is your commute if you don\u2019t mind me asking? There\u2019s plenty of students attending CSUEB that commute from the furthest of close to 2 hours. \n\nI normally use assist.org to figure out what classes convert over to the institution I\u2019d be transferring to, but in regards to your upper div courses getting transferred it\u2019s gonna be tricky. Try talking to your academic counselor/career counselor. \n\nFrom what I know, some upper div courses can\u2019t be transferred because the institutions have much different curriculum and therefore you\u2019d have to retake the class at the institution you\u2019d be transferring to. This happened to me as I\u2019m currently taking a course that I previously completed at a community college but the CSU won\u2019t convert the credits.",

                    "comment": "I live near South Hayward which is almost a two hour commute plus with the university putting most classes in person, the lines to the shuttles get long and with the shuttles taking a while to arrive at the Bart stations, you sometimes have to resort to using the buses (which get packed a lot) to get to your classes on time. I find myself having to wake up 4+ hours before my classes start just to get to campus and hour before they start. So CSUEB is much closer to me.",

However when I was going to make that decision, my dad peer pressured me into considering SF State more and even yelled at me \u201cif you don\u2019t go to SF State then you won\u2019t go to school at all.\u201d After that, I enrolled in SFSU but and was online due to the pandemic, however, I did have to go to campus for two days a week last spring. Now after dealing with this 5 day commute, I am highly considering transferring to a nearby school because the commute was alright for 2 days a week, but 5 was too much.",

            "comment": "The previous commenter has the right thought.  Courses are transferable, but they might not count toward the major in the same way.  Since you indicate you haven't taken upper division courses yet, it shouldn't be a big deal, though.  If you are intent on coming to East Bay next fall and need to take upper division classes in spring, take upper division GE. (We have local overlay requirements, but i think SFSU has similar ones.)   It appears that you can still apply to transfer for spring.  Per https://www.csueastbay.edu/admissions/documents-deadlines-and-important-information/application-and-doc-deadlines/transfer-students.html , the priority deadline has passed, but applications are still open.\n\nThe Computer Engineering major is here:  https://catalog.csueastbay.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=31&amp;poid=13267 .  Knock out a many lower division requirements (course numbers 100-299) as possible.  \n\nI'm not part of that program.  So, I'll leave it to others to comment on its quality.\n\nGood luck!",

I am taking marine biology this spring semester but I\u2019m really scared that I might fail the class or drop the class. I listed this class as a planned course in the spring 2022 term on my CSU application. I am SOOO worried regarding how will this impact me if I fail the class, will they deny me?",

            "comment": "I know this is over a week old and also I don\u2019t go to CSUEB, BUT I go to a Cal Poly and on most CSU applications it should tell you whether you\u2019re fully admitted or conditionally admitted. For my campus it was 1 green checkmark on the university\u2019s application portal (not CSU apply) for conditional and 2 green checkmarks for full admission. Full means you can flunk the course and it won\u2019t matter, but conditional means one or more requirement depend on your courses in progress. I would see if you\u2019re fully admitted, request a P/NP grade for the course you\u2019re currently failing if it\u2019s not too late, and contact a CSUEB admissions counselor.",

Did you have the option to complete it during the summer, if you couldn\u2019t complete during the spring semester? \nIs it better to focus on the internship itself, or did you combine working as part of it? \nRegarding the capstone project, what were the guidelines as to what you could focus on? \n\nThank you for your input.",

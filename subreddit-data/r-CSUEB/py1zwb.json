    "postText": " \n\nHello everyone!\n\nMy name is Damian, and I'm an aerospace engineering student at UC Irvine. I've created a club called The Futurist Society where we discuss future trends and technologies. We talk about flying cars, reusable rockets, fusion power, and much more. We also have plans to start doing projects as our org gets more established.\n\nThis post is being made on behalf of our CSUEB chapter, which is in the process of forming. We have chapters at other schools as well; if you're interested in the future, come join our network!\n\nTFS CSUEB Discord:  [https://discord.gg/FDe9ZbDjzv](https://discord.gg/FDe9ZbDjzv)  \n\nTFS National Discord: [https://discord.gg/3a9eepuC9P](https://discord.gg/3a9eepuC9P)  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tfyk2rrtnhq71.png?width=1545&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b5373ed13400df0fcf0eaf3d8cb7a20c3d8e5db1",

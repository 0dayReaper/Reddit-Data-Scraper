I can say however that the course is very manageable and if you have any grasp on stats and how to use R, this class is generally a breeze with take home midterms (I guess it's all take home right now though).  The code you will be using is given in class, you just have to figure out what parameters to change when working with different data or getting the visualization to look differently.  Dr. Kerr is normally a very rigorous professor with difficult assignments but this is one of the easier classes he teaches.",

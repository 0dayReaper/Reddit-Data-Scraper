    "postText": "Why does the fee still so expensive even though it's Fully Online? F-1 students are paying up to 9000 USD per semester  for ONLINE CLASSES! No Fee Deductions.  ICE just announce  F-1 students who are enrolled in Fully Online Class have to leave United states. Imagine waking up at 3am to attend ONLINE class at their home country, and paying such an expensive school fees. Can't you guys open hybrid classes? Other universities is doing it.",

If you go to MyCSUEB and search by Mode of Instruction: In-person, you will get a list of classes that are still in-person.\n\nEdit: Also compared to most other colleges CSUs have really cheap international tuition, UCs are almost twice as expensive and the private colleges I\u2019ve looked at are even more expensive.",

That means that OP will have to find 3(!) hybrid classes (labs or PE is all I can imagine), each of which must be 3 units. And an online class to top it off.\n\nTuition-wise, some UCs and private schools provide tuition support and seek out funding for students to attend their programs.",

There\u2019s no point in issuing a visa to a person who does not attend physical classes, think about it from the DHS perspective.\n\nWhen I talk about support, I mostly mean grad school since it\u2019s something I\u2019m dealing with right now. Should\u2019ve mentioned that probably.",

I\u2019m pretty upset myself at how Int\u2019l office is handling things right now. \n\nHonest advice, since you\u2019ll have to leave the States anyway - apply for this: https://www.csueastbay.edu/registrar/records/planned-educational-leave.html\n\nTake a break, go to your home country, get a remote job or internship (if you can), work on hobbies, help out friends and family. &gt;!consider a different institution maybe!&lt;\n\nIf you specifically want to stay in the States or can\u2019t leave, look for a community college in the Bay that does in-person classes. If you don\u2019t drive - buy a bike and bart/ac it.",

Do you want an apartment's? Do you want a shared or private room? What qualities are you looking for in a roommate? Consider whether you'd like to live with strangers or friends. \n\nOnce you have a list of wants, it's much easier to start posting ads. Living on your own but sharing a space is stressful so go into every situation with a mind towards protecting yourself and your finances, and remember that housing is always in flux. Be patient and adaptable. I've been through it all so shoot me specific questions!\n",

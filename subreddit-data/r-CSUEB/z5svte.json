I wanted to join a sorority in hopes to change that. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll make friends if I join one but what\u2019s greek life like? Are there any parties? What are the events like?",

Though I do know greek life at commuter schools is never going to be as exciting as they are at known \"party schools\" or bigger Uni's. In case you find these helpful:\n\nCSU greek life brochure ---&gt; [brochure](https://www.csueastbay.edu/clubsandorgs/greek-life/)\n\nCSU chapter descriptions ---&gt; [chapters](https://www.csueastbay.edu/clubsandorgs/greek-life/chapters.html)\n\nFacebook photos of greek campus events ---&gt; [photos](https://www.facebook.com/CsuebGLOs/photos_albums)\n\nSimilar Reddit question ---&gt; [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CSUEB/comments/th4vvk/do_csueb_have_frat_parties_or_crazy_parties_with/)\n\nIf you're just interested in the social aspect, a good alternative is joining a bunch of clubs (like at the student union), and attending events and such. Personally, my closest connections usually end up being people I meet in class, or randoms I regularly see like at the campus gym or whatever. If you find nobody to drink/party with, you could also visit the local bar and get to know the regulars lol. Good luck.",

            "comment": "This is a super honest answer from someone who had the same mindset going in but ended up leaving my org (Alpha Phi)\n\nImo not worth it as a transfer. Prices to join can vary from 75$-2500$\u2026 the people in the org can be nice but from what I experienced it was the fake kind of nice just like people everywhere else can be. As soon as you do something they don\u2019t like, isn\u2019t cool, or you leave they drop you \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fAs a transfer most orgs were hesitant to let me join at all since my membership and dues wouldn\u2019t add to the overall collection of money or something. This is also a commuter school so to hang out you have to stay super late into the night or come super early. There are required events that you have to attend or you will be dropped with no refund. The one party I heard about during the semester I was a member was shutdown by police before it had a chance to get started. The overall workload was more intense than my classes were. There was also a lot of drug use, not just weed. They would use the group chat to sell to each other. I didn\u2019t like that too much, even as someone who uses edibles. \n\nI had more success being social in my classes and in clubs! Those are the friends I still talk to! Once you get into your upper grad classes you start seeing the same classmates in every class. A whole room of likeminded people \ud83e\udd70 I would also add that non Greek life students laugh at those who join frats or sororities and will make fun of them. East bay is not allowed to have any organization housing so your dues go towards parties or events instead. If you do join try getting into one of the smaller ones, those seem to be a bit better!\n\nI also live with sorority girls (from a smaller org) at the moment and they are the same as the ones in the org I was in. They cling to their sorority identity even as post grads which is a little cringy to me but that\u2019s super biased lol",

            "comment": "So I'm a Greek life person I joined last year and this is what I've picked up so far. Greek life varies from org to org as each one has different traditions and processes. Yes there are definitely orgs that focuse on partying and others that focus on self improvement and professional connections. Those social fraternities sometimes come at a higher cost (especially money, some orgs charge up to 3k to be a part of them). The cheaper ones have their benefits but also downfalls such as no Greek House. Sororities and Fraternities are the two basic ones but East Bay has I believe 3 Greek Orgs that are co-ed and I'm part of one of them.\n\nIn short Greek life is fun and exciting you'll meet plenty of people and grow as a person throughout it. You're welcome to message me if you have any other questions.",

I don't have high ass expectations, and I don't expect to join a frat nor go to parties every day. However, given that it's a commuter school, I still want to know if there is life and activity on campus, or any general input on what social life there is like.",

There's now a Univeristy Hour from 12:15-1pm every Tuesday and Thursday (that might change, I'm not sure).

            "comment": "Well take it from me I work at the disc on campus. It's quite easy to socialize if you go to events as the turnout rate is pretty high and from there you can do whatever you want with people, but if you're looking for a more \"college\" experience then look no further to the beginning of each semester. This is because this is one most frats and sororities have their rushing period and they attempt to get new members, this is the easiest way to go find parties if that's your groove. Besides that to gain more friends there's always clubs on campus which are special interests, but there are a bit more general ones like circle k club. Otherwise the social life on campus ain't too bad because so long as you know where to look you should have people to talk to you, such as the game zone both the one with table top games and console games usually have people in them so it's pretty easy to strike up a conversation there. It definitely is a bit hard when you don't know where to look, but once you know where to look it shouldn't be too hard.",

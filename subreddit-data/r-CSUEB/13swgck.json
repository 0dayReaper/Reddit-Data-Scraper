If that is true it'd be more like %15, probably a little more for us grad students since everything is. \n\nAlso not following your logic: if it goes into effect when they vote this summer couldn't we try to source the money to pay off our tuition/course fees now before it is implemented so it doesn't hit us until spring semester? \n\nCSUs are relatively cheap but add on the unpaid interships, books etc and it is $$$$$$$",

You can try to pay what it says you owe now, but until classes start they can change the price and you will have to pay whatever they say. You can also not pay but that means you\u2019re choosing to drop out of East Bay. \n\nNot sure why you thinks I\u2019m telling you to drop out. I was just listing your options when it comes to your bill.",

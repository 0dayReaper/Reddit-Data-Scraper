I know it's a far distance between us and the cost can add up to be very expensive, but I've talked to my parents about it so now my only doubt would be if the commuting time would be worth it. I'd appreciate any advice especially if anyone had personal experience with this commute.",

But I've been stuck in traffic before on the way and back, which can last over an hour especially on the I-880. My advice to you is to consider whenever getting stuck in traffic everyday is worth the trouble.",

It isn't to bad if you have classes in person once or twice a week and is doable but not if you have classes all week. The best advice is to carefully consider your options because it's somewhat of a big investment",

I keep to myself mostly, and just want a chill person (or persons) who's willing to share common spaces, and willing to work with each other to keep the drama down.  \n\n\nI'm looking to get a room for myself with a private bathroom, and my budget allows that  \n\n\nSend me a message here so we can meet up on campus, see if we're a good fit, and talk about options.",

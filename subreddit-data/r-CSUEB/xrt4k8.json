Uses genre/class/valence/song/weather/chorus/bridge and other factors.\n\nWould love criticism/feedback, thanks! :)\n\nApp Store link (for Spotify + iPhone users): [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smores-music-discovery/id1626768775](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smores-music-discovery/id1626768775)  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v8xz35f8lxq91.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5c9e1b4575a64dfd07e9e998b6fa5086d65b6ad9",

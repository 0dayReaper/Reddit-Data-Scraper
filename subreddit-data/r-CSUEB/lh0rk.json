            "comment": "Sorry, I just discovered this subreddit.\n\nJust finished my fourth quarter of the BSBA (online business classes). Feel free to ask questions, but no guarantee that I'll have an answer. \n\nA few quick thoughts:\n\nIf you've done online classes before,  no worries, it's pretty much the same.\n\nBlackboard sucks, has sucked, and always will suck. If you have a group project, try to use the Horizon gmail as a sort of chatroom/forum for you group. Blackboard's collaboration tools blow.\n\nThe program is great, teachers are good, the only real problem is classes. If you don't take the right class at the right time, it might not be offered again for four or five quarters. I'm looking to take one business class this quarter abd pray like hell I can get into a couple of elective classes during open enrollment.\n\nThe name is Dennis, by the way. I find that the BSBA community is pretty cohesive, so you'll have a lot of people taking the same classes that you'll get to know through discussion board posts and group work. \n\nGotta go to bed, but Reddit is my newest vice, so feel free to reply and I'll get back to you.",

I have two electives left to do, so I'm trying to get those taken cade of to make three classes total. Unfortunately, we don't get priority for classes outside of the BSBA program, so I have to wait a week after classes start to try to add in. There's not a lot of selection for online classes, so I may have to do a night class.\n\nAs far as advice, never buy from the bookstore, look online. Be aware of what classes are being offered when. It's good to plan out a couple of quarters ahead. If you need help figuring something out with the program, send an email to Claire Abshire. She has saved my ass several times and is a VERY helpful resource.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you need help. ",

You can take classes outside of BSBA if there is a need (like I have for my electives), but you have to wait for \"open university\", which means you have to wait a week after classes start to add in. It's much easier to just stay within the classes offered by the program if possible. ",

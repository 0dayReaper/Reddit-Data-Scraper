I found this roadmap: https://www.csueastbay.edu/art/files/docs/prospective-students-roadmaps/graphic-design-bfa.pdf\n\nI also found this which is very similar, it details and breaks it from lower-division and upper-division courses you need to take for your graphic design concentration: https://catalog.csueastbay.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=19&amp;poid=7596&amp;returnto=12550\n\nIn terms of Math and English, try talking to an academic advisor, they\u2019ll tell you what you need to take too! Schedule an app with them, their emails are in the website: https://www.csueastbay.edu/aace/",

Knowing that I am not guaranteed an education in Silicon Valley or there is little information on what I'm asking about, it would be very consoling to hear anything on what this has to offer.",

Suzy Wear is the head of the department of art and teaches many of the classes. She is very knowledgeable and she actually knows the industry very well. I\u2019m currently in her Narrative Illustration classes and had her last semester for beginning illustration and she has taught me so much that I\u2019m way better than I was before. But if any advice I would say to just keep drawing on your own and you will get better on your own and you can always email her and ask her questions about the program. I love this school.",

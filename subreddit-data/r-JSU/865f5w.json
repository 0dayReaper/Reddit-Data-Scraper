    "postText": "President Beehler announced this afternoon that due to the extensive damage and needing to assess living situations and building infrastructure that JSU will be closed until April 2nd.\n\nPlease take the time to look at the shelter listings if you are displaced or homeless - also check Jacksonville State University on Facebook for more information if you are a student.\n\nFor other information, there is another thread that has donations/food/and volunteer information.\n\nPlease stay safe! If you have any questions or need help I will do my best or direct you to someone who can.\n\nEDIT: April 2nd is a tentative opening date. Please be aware that the damage is extensive and that JSU officials are working diligently to get information to students.",

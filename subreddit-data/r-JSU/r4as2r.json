    "postText": "I'm a first-year student at Jacksonville University, and I have a question about the grading system. I'm a failing Spanish student, but I've heard that a 60 is a D. According to a recent friend who has lived in Alabama his entire life, the grading system is as follows: Is this the system of grading: 59-0 equals F, 69-60 equals D, 79-70 equals C, 89-80 equals B, and 100-90 equals A. What I'm wondering is if I could still pass Spanish.",

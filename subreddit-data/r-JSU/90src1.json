I went to see The Giver because I had read the book in high school (and actually liked it) and also enjoyed the movie. Pretty sure I had a reminder set since like first semester to be sure I remembered to see it. Did you go and see it?\n\nHonestly I'm planning to post this sub to /r/redditrequest so I can get mod and try and get the sub going a bit. (I'll probably PM the active mod on here first, he's a mod on a bunch of empty subs so it's clear he just made a bunch of likely subs.)\n\nWere you in Jacksonville during the tornado?",

Glad to see that a lot of the damages have been repaired though",

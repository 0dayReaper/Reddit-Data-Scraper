    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI found this subreddit yesterday and wanted to join in. I\u2019m in one of the smaller departments of JSU and we also host some events. Since this subreddit is a little quiet, maybe sharing events might be a good way to generate some excitement.\n\nThis weekend is the AOPi Madri Gras parade! The parade starts at Bibb Graves and if you buy a ticket ($6) you\u2019ll get a red beans and rice meal at the alumni house.\n\nKappa Pi from the art department also recently had a print block workshop, where you used a tree block and got an impression. This is the second workshop they\u2019ve done so if there\u2019s another event they host, I\u2019ll be sure to add it on here!\n\nThe Foothills Piano Festival is this upcoming Sunday at 3 PM in Mason Hall, definitely check it out!\n\nAIGA JSU is also from the art department and is hosting their monthly type fight at momma goldburghs for a spirit night on February 21, get there at 6:30 to meet some of their members and the event starts at 7!\n\nI\u2019ll be on the look out for other events and I\u2019ll try to post them, the Red and White JSU sends out has most of these but some are definitely overlooked or not reported! Any events you guys are interested in?",

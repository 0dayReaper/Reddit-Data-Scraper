But since the red and white hasn\u2019t come out yet, I don\u2019t know about to many events this week.\n\nThere\u2019s another Spirit Night at Mama Goldbergs  Tuesday, Feb 27th to help out a fellow Gamecock, Melina Greenwood! Melina has a heart condition that is putting her in serious risk and has to be taken to a facility out of state in order to get the operation and treatment she needs. Be sure to swing by, any purchase goes to helping her with her medical expenses!\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already checked it out, be sure to look into People of JSU on Facebook and Instagram! Patrick Yim runs these pages to interview fellow Gamecocks and make campus a little more transparent. Interested in being interviewed? Be sure to contact him, Patrick is friendly and easy to talk to!\n\nGuys and Dolls is still in the drama department! March 2nd-3rd are the last days to catch though so mark your calendars and go see it!\n\nI\u2019ll be sure to edit this when the red and white comes out but please add in with events from your department or campus events that are going on!\n",

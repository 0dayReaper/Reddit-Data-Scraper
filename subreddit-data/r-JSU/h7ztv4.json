    "postText": "Why is it that a state-funded university can fully remodel two rooms in a living complex or residential building, and use those two rooms to advertise as all of their housing? I can\u2019t tell you how many students, parents, and even employees complain and cringe over the HUGE difference between what\u2019s advertised on the website, and what your thousands of dollars actually gets you. They force you to buy a meal plan and live on campus, when they can get away with it. There\u2019s never enough parking. And don\u2019t even get me started on the conditions of some of these buildings. Buckled walls, ceilings, and floors. Severely aged features and tile. Bug problems in certain buildings. I mean, I get it. JSU does not have an in-house construction department. But how come the only people they seem to actually care about are athletes and maybe high-level office workers? Yeah, games make you money. But you know where else their money comes from? Students. It may be cheaper than other universities in-state, but how come we needed a multi-story gym with a Starbucks over basic remodeling and care of certain buildings people live and work in?",

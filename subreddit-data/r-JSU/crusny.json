(Even though he had been inactive from all of Reddit for over a year)\n\nHe seems to have deleted it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/98hpj1/requesting\\_rjsu\\_inactive\\_mods/e5uq0wx/?context=8&amp;depth=9](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/98hpj1/requesting_rjsu_inactive_mods/e5uq0wx/?context=8&amp;depth=9)\n\nHe has a bunch of other subs which are inactive and were never used. And even other college subs that he doesn't moderate at all. He's recently been active though, so can't even attempt another /r/redditrequest\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/user/Mutki/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mutki/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd be willing to moderate this sub and try and advertise it around campus, but he refuses to give me moderator access. (Pretty sure anyone can hang stuff up on the bulletin boards around campus, could make some posters for those)\n\n/r/JacksonvilleAL is also a dead sub. /r/Alabama has a couple people from Calhoun though from what I've seen.",

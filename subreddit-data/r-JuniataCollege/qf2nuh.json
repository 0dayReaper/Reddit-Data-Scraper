    "postText": "So there I was in the middle of the Sahara Desert, thirsty out of my mind. Right in front of me I saw a vending machine but the only selection was none other than grape flavored medicine. I deposited my lucky quarter into that artificial food dispensary unit, and out kluncked the bottle. I was so thirsty that I gulped it down like Sal Vulcano when he realized he was tonight's big loser. After I finished the entire bottle of grape flavored medicine it had quenched my thirst but I looked down at the bottle. This was no ordinary grape flavored medicine, it was grape flavored laxatives. For the next 4 hours I experienced pain I can only describe with a diagram of South America. After the worst 4 hours of my life I took a nap. 3 weeks passed until I recovered from the Grape Flavored \"Medicine.\" I awoke and saw a figure shrouded by light. I couldn\u2019t make out the face but then he said \u201cI am sure my music has a taste of codfish in it.\u201d My ears were still ringing from the medicine, but when I heard those words, I knew exactly who he was. It Was Edvard Grieg.",

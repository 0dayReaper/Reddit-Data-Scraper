    "postText": "Hi. I will be getting my results soon and want to study BA media and comms at Goldsmiths- due to start this September 2020. What is first year like (academically in terms of difficulty as well as dealing with a new environment in higher education) as well as other years and what have previous students studied during first year? Do timetables have long lectures throughout the week and were contact hours longer for this course previously? Can any of you recommend further reading for me and give me advice on how to structure essays (writing styles and referencing etc) and what lecturers are looking for in students\u2019 work or engagement? I know some people choose different study pathways each year as modules vary. I am into journalism currently and documentary making. I also love analysing film but like anthropological study too. Please can previous students get back to me about this course, I will appreciate your feedback very much. Thanks\n\n\nRegards\n\nEmmanuella",

            "comment": "Hi! I'm not doing Media and Communications but BA Curating, so can't answer everything but may be able to help with getting to grips with higher education! There's a lot of help you can get about essay writing, and I've always had average grades, but for me the important thing is finding your voice and making a compelling argument. The range of topics will be huge, so if you can find something that really interests you each time, then you will enjoy the process and be able to speak concisely. You always want to clearly guide the reader, so don't be cryptic and always explain what you intend to say. As for further reading, obviously I don't know specifics for your course but a good way to start is to look at the bibliographies of texts you've found interesting to find other material relating to the discussions. Also if you want to find something specific you can use the goldsmiths library search and other academic search engines like [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/), to locate something or just to browse some keywords to see what comes up.\n\nThe lecturers are always looking for clarity and engagement, which for me comes through interest, so my advice would be if you find a particular lesson interesting at any point in the term then start to dig deeper and you can start to develop some questions from there.\n\nAlso Goldsmiths Library isn't the best compared to others in London but they do have thousands of DVDs to rent. Last year I bought a portable DVD player and watched whatever films or series I wanted to with friends. Unless it's really obscure they'll probably have it, It's a great resource\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I could put you in touch with a friend who just graduated from media and comms (I think) but I don't think she uses Reddit so it would have to be another way.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I received a conditional offer from MA in Game Art &amp; Design in Goldsmiths. I am an international student, finished my BA in the United States. I am doing fine arts for my undergraduate... so I am quite surprised to receive the offer from a game design program. From my initial research, Goldsmiths is a prestigious uni. However this Game Art &amp; Design program seems to be pretty new, and I couldn't find many information online. I am interested in Game as a media for art in general. ( I also applied for computational art and etc. for the similar reason.) Could anyone give me some idea or impression on the program? Many thanks in advance!",

When I was there I had a friend who was doing Computer Arts and he found it challenging, but that's a good thing I think. Good luck and congratulations! Did you apply anywhere else?",

                    "comment": "Thank you so much! I didn't expect to get a reply this soon! I applied for computational art, children's book and illustration, and photography &amp; moving image in Goldsmiths, there will be a interview for the children's book MA this Friday, didn't hear anything back from other two yet.\nOthers are all MFA programs in fine art painting. I have an offer from SCAD, but it was too expensive so I don't think I will even consider going. I just received the \"unsuccessful\" notification from Slade this morning! /heartbroken\n\nMy undergrads was a liberal arts college, and I took my first art course in my second year in college. I studied abroad last year in GSA and heard tons of good things about Goldsmiths. (so many that I felt I've been there already!!)\n\nTo be honest, I am not quite sure where to go in the future, but I am very interested in exploring game and illustration as a media in themselves ( that was what I wrote in the PS)\n\n it is really hard to find anyone to speak to here. All my roommates are doing Bio or Econ as their majors. I guess we have like 3 studio art major this year (plus 4 minors?) and only me and another girl will go to an art school for the graduate. So thanks again (this is a lot to read)!",

So don't worry, especially because they are getting realllly busy at this time, and admission office hardly replies to any email, which happened to all the schools I've applied to. You can try to contact the professor of this program instead if admission office never replies (also to show your interest... which would be really advantageous if they are kind of undecided among applicants...) And good luck with your application!!",

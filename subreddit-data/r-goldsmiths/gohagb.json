    "postText": "I've accepted my offer to study at Goldsmiths and will hopefully start in fall (if corona doesn't ruin that)! I've looked at all the accommodation halls but am honestly super confused, and would really love some advice!  \n\n\nI want to live in a lively hall with rooms that are on the larger side, ideally - I've heard that Loring and Chesterman are the best for the lively bit - but the rooms seem awfully small? The rooms in Surrey House Annexe seem the best, but a lot of reviews say it's super quiet. And I've also read that Raymont is more lively since the security at Loring is strict or something - does anyone know which would be better?",

            "comment": "Hi- unfortunately most of the rooms in the halls are small. If you can spare the money you could go for a double room but I can\u2019t quite remember which halls have those. Loring, Raymont and Surrey House are the most social. And Surrey has a beautiful orangery and a social area.",

One exchange student fell off the roof and broke several limbs and all the Americans went home after the Canary Wharf bomb rattled the windows. &lt;/oldman&gt;",

            "comment": "Surrey House alum here, and I would definitely recommend it. I can, in my unbiased opinion, say that it's the superior choice. Surrey is far from quiet, has lots of regular social events and the proximity to uni is obviously helpful in the social aspect. I'd often have people over between classes to chill. Also super close to the Fat Walrus, an awesome New Cross pub and a Sainsbury's and Costcutter, plus other shops. There are two bus stops right outside as well. If you get stuck in Old House though, there's no lift and three floors sooo that can be tough. Hope this helps!!",

    "postText": "Hey Redditors! \n\nI am a US citizen, and I have applied to three different schools in London: City University, London College of Communication and Goldsmiths University all for a MA in Media and Communications. \n\nI'm still waiting to hear back from City and UAL, but I was accepted almost immediately to Goldsmiths (within the same week of my application) which was shocking and also super exciting!\n\nI have been waiting to hear back from the other schools so I haven't done much planning, but decided to take a look at all of the tuitions for each school to at least have a better idea of my options once I know whether or not I have been accepted. I feel somewhat dumb in not realizing how much more expensive it would be for an international student to study in the UK. For a year long MA program at Goldsmiths for this upcoming year it is \u00a315610 which comes out to $19157.06 with the current exchange rate. \n\nSo I guess my question is, is it worth it to spend that kind of money to do a masters in the UK? Specifically at Goldsmiths at this point.\n\nThanks in advanced for the suggestions/help/insight/etc! ",

Goldsmith's is currently 51st in UK rankings, which could be better...\n\nI'm a student at Goldsmiths currently (undergraduate) and I've really had enough of being there. The school community is pretty pretentious and arsey, although the extended local community is nice enough. London is an expensive place to live too, even if you're making a saving compared to studying stateside. I have friends that are house sharing at about \u00a3170 a week... So don't forget to factor in exorbitant rental!\n\nI'm applying for an MA myself and have chosen Birmingham, via a distance course. It's cheaper, is a better uni ranking wise and has specific modules that I wish to study.",

The Media &amp; Comms Department is actually ranked 15th in the UK (City is in 9th place). So, in answer to your question, it was worth every penny, but I didn't pay full tuition, there's a Santander International scholarship that grants up to 5k (sterling). You should also check out the Chevening scholarship... they give lots of funding (tuition, living expenses, travel...) and is not that difficult to get. Good luck!",

Canadian here who is currently doing MA Media and Comms and had a very similar situation to you - the surprise of getting accepted so promptly. \n\nIf it helps at all, Goldsmiths is now ranked 8th in the world in QS World University Rankings, up from 27th last year. The only thing higher in the UK is the LSE, also more expensive and perhaps more 'traditional' in their approach and political stance. \n\nIs it worth it? I think it depends on what you want out of it and what you put into it. How much have you looked into the program? What are you looking to get into?\n\nhttp://www.gold.ac.uk/news/uni-rankings/",

I know of a few people doing them and they're getting lots of solid hands-on practical experience. They're wishing the Media and Comms department but aren't theory-based like the MA Media and Communications program. \n\nTake a look at\nhttp://www.gold.ac.uk/media-communications/programmes/",

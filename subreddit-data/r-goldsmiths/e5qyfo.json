    "postText": "Hey everyone \n\nI've recently been accepted into the above program at Goldsmiths, and I'm seriously considering attending. However, I'm based in America so I don't know if I'd be able to visit the campus before attending. Still, I wanted to ask some questions that I would at an open house online.\n\nWhat parts of the UX program best prepared you for your career? What parts could have been better?  \nDid Goldsmiths give you good networking and career resources?  \nAlso, UX is a field that seems to change a lot, and some argue that you could learn it on the job. How does the course keep up with changes, and how has it helped more than learning alone?\n\nFor context, I don't currently have UX design skills. I'm a writer, but I like web design, so I am really interested in getting my foot into the UX door. \n\nAnything helps, thanks!",

            "comment": "Hi,\n\nGood questions, and in fact ones that a number of our students asked before they came here.\n\nAs the convener of this programme. I won't answer on behalf of the students other than to say that  the cohort includes people from many different academic and professional backgrounds, so the answer to your question could well be different for different members of the cohort.\n\nAddressing the part about the course being agile to change. ....\n\nFirstly, UX builds on but also references a long history of work in Ergonomics, Human Factors (HF), Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and disciples such as Computing, Psychology and Design. We bring all this together as we seek to explore and teach how to propose/design digital solutions that can be engineered to give satisfaction in use. These various disciplines suggest a multi-disciplinary and team based approach, which we encourage on the programme.\n\nAs for the agility, we have an industrial advisory board (IAB) that worked with us to scope the curriculum and to put the programme together to ensure that it meets the needs of the \"industry\" (commerce, charities, governmental organisations etc). We continue to consult with the IAB to ensure that the programme remains relevant. We also have on staff people directly working in the industry, and we have a final project option which is to work on a real world project give to us by an external organisation.\n\nI hope this addresses the question for yourself and any other (potential) applicants who might be considering joining us next year.\n\nAll the best.",

I have a few follow up questions.\n\nThe final project sounds great, and I'm curious to know what companies you work with? I'm interested in seeing which ones have a U.S. branch so that I can make connections that would transfer back home (if I return upon graduation). In addition, do you have a statistic on employment rates after graduation?",

    "postText": "Hey all, I'm in North Wales and not a student, but I have a request that would mean a lot to me if someone volunteered to help out with. I just need someone to borrow a DVD from the library and send me a copy of the file.\n\nThere's a really fascinating documentary on a DVD in Goldsmiths Library I'd love to be able to archive online, ideally with english subtitles. \n\nIt's called 'Ulrike Marie Meinhof; A Letter to Her Daughter by Timon Koulmasis (1994)'.\n\nI'll describe the film and link a clip [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppsAkOjR-lA), then if someone who's a student or staff at one of these universities (or knows someone who is and can ask them to help) and you like this idea... could you borrow the DVD and send the file to my email at [theosladehome@gmail.com](mailto:theosladehome@gmail.com)\n\nObviously I understand also if you don't want to take a film out on the theme of  terrorism. I'm simply interested in the phenomenon of how and why the children of defeated fascist countries grew up to have the most active rebel urban guerrilla movements. The obvious answer is anger at their  parents generation, but how that played out in each of their lived experiences is interesting to study.\n\nMany  were super-tankies and one even became a neo-nazi later in life. And  many who were tankies also become anarchists later in life like members of the [Weather Underground](https://kolektiva.media/w/414uvX7uX8sjDPRgaLDGJn) and the [Black Liberation Army](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYQ8N6sit2E).\n\nThere's also simply the true crime fascination of Red Army Faction ex-members still on the run 30 years later, having given up the urban guerrilla  project, but still [robbing banks to survive underground](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/former-red-army-faction-members-linked-to-botched-robbery).\n\n\\-\n\nSo, going back to a description of the documentary:\n\n&gt;A German-language documentary directed by Timon Koulmasis, plus funded and released by ARTE, a French-German cultural channel.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This documentary chronicles the life of Ulrike Meinhof, an accomplished, idealistic journalist who turned to terrorism. Filmmaker Timon Koulmasis speaks with Meinhof's friends and colleagues to reveal how her beliefs shifted from political activism to urban terrorism, resulting in her arrest in 1972 and her suicide four years later.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As he narrates the program, Koulmasis recalls the years from his childhood when he resided with Meinhof and her daughters.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Highlights include the following:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Publisher Klaus Wagenbach describes Meinhof's decision to break Andreas Baader out of jail, live underground, and launch an armed struggle with her comrades.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Jurgen and Monika Seifert, who attended school with Meinhof, recall the political groups that she joined as a student and the influence of her politically active mother.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Meinhof's one-time husband, Klaus Rainer Rohl, reminisces about the couple's first meeting, her employment at his newspaper \"Konkret,\" and their courtship and marriage.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And poet Peter Ruhmkorf recalls the political group that Meinhof joined which led to the break-up of her marriage.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Then, Timon Koulmasis's father, Peter, describes the odd household where Meinhof's children grew up along with his own kids. Ruth Walz, a friend of Meinhof's, recalls their children's \"alternative\" nursery school, Meinhof's periods of depression, and her yearning to politically mobilize a women's residence.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Also, Walz comments on Baade's influence on Meinhof's life; Freimut Duve recalls Meinhof's actions prior to burning down her ex-husband's home; and Astrid Proll describes her unique place in the Red Army Faction.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Additionally, the former journalist's writings are read aloud, including her farewell letter to Rohl and letters that she wrote to her children from jail. In audio and film excerpts, Meinhof speaks about the need to vote for peace; the purpose of the \"urban guerilla\"; the incompatible elements of her life; and the problems with authority in Germany.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As the program concludes, Wagenbach recalls his final meeting with the urban guerilla prior to her arrest and explains that he tried to persuade her to abandon the struggle.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The program includes footage of police searching for Red Army members; \"Bambule,\" a film that Meinhof wrote; her appearances on German television; protests in Germany; and home movies of Meinhof and Rohl.\n\n\\-\n\nFinally, for further reading you can check out:\n\n\u2605 [The Director's Notes](http://www.timonkoulmasis.eu/en/documentaries/ulrike-marie-meinhof.html)\n\n\u2605 &amp; [Related Films](https://www.closeupfilmcentre.com/vertigo_magazine/volume-3-issue-7-autumn-2007/a-few-elements-for-another-vision-of-the-baader-meinhof-red-army/)\n\n\\-",

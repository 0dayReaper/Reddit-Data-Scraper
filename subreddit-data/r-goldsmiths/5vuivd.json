    "postText": "Looking for 3-4 Student Brand Ambassadors to promote my app one day with a commission agreement for future earning potential. Here's what required for the day promotion where you'll be paid \u00a350 each:\n\n- Initially promoting the app with Meetsome gear on (t-shirts, it may be cold so hoodies under allowed!) via interacting with individuals/crowds in central London (an area like Oxford Circus, TBC)\n- Talking about and demonstrating Meetsome (in-app) and its benefits\n- Handing out flyers and other goods to them\n- Attending some local events (speed dating, social meet ups, etc: open to ideas!) and promoting the app by talking about it, demonstrating it and its benefits and passing out flyers\n- Capturing engaged potential users with snaps/selfies and posting to Meetsome's Social pages on Facebook, Twitter, etc\n- I will be filming during this time to post content for sharing!\n\nIt would be great if you could help Meetsome get several users online beforehand, please check out http://www.meetsome.co!\n\nThe long-term is the potential to earn commission based on the users that you refer to sign up in-app (up to \u00a31 per user)! I will forward all who qualify an agreement explaining how this works.\n\nFor the day promotion, it would be great to get together one Saturday in March/April:\n- 11th of March\n- 25th March\n- 1st of April (could potentially do a \"No April Fool's\" theme - all creative ideas are welcome!)\n\nPlease send an email to contact@meetsome.co for further information, rather than replying in this thread!",

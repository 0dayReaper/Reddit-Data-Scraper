    "postText": "I'm looking to have a durable, visible substitute for simple engraving/engraving &amp; blackening. Currently, I have Silver, with blackened (milled? Cast?) depressions. \n\nI was thinking the most visible, would be the contrast between a bright White-Gold alloy, and a rich/dark Rose-Gold alloy. Either way (Rose in white preferably, or white in rose). \n\nI'm looking for durability in the decade(s) range (as opposed to the darkened depressions in silver, which have already shown wear within a month). So, I'd think that matching coefficients of expansion, and adhesion/bonding forces, would be most important.\n\nCould rose gold soldering alloy (ie 18KRM2, or 18KRH2) bond well enough, to fully fill &amp; stay in place, long term? Would it be better if the fill contained some percentage (which?) ultra fine Rose-Gold alloy powder itself, in addition to the rose-gold solder? \n\nI'd imagine that engraving depth, as well as smoothness of the base, would play substantially into the bonding strength. Thoughts?\n\nThanks in advance.",

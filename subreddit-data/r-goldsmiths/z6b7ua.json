    "postText": "Hello, im a 24yo that started making gold castings since 2021. I don\u2019t know any goldsmiths nor my family is in any way close to that culture. I started because I always wanted to be an artist, i love the feeling of creating something and enjoy the process. I got to the point that youtube is just not enough for me to find knowledge and answers for my questions. I live in Puerto Rico and there are absolutely no goldsmiths willing to give me a class or apprenticeship. I want to learn more i want to do more i just want to keep going but i keep getting stuck. If there is anyone that can point out the direction i need to take or some tips no matter how basic. All i know is beacuse all the times i have failed, all the stones ive broken, all the gold and silver i have lost and most of all the internet, really all i have. I included some pictures of my work.",

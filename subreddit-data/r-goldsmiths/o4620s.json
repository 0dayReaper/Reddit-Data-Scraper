    "postText": "Hey everyone! Thanks for taking the time to read this post. I would like some advice on which school I should go for. I\u2019m an arts manager so I\u2019m applying to Goldsmiths\u2019 MA Arts Administration and Cultural Policy, as well as King\u2019s College London\u2019s MA Arts &amp; Cultural Management. There are some pros and cons to each (e.g, there\u2019s work placement for Goldsmiths - which i value - that is lacking in KCL).\n \nI\u2019m not from the UK, so a lot of my research has solely been based on what I\u2019ve read online. If anyone has any advice on which course is better in terms of work opportunities, reputation etc - please let me know! \n\nThank you in advance x",

And also the application and selection process seems a lot more rigorous so it\u2019s making me second guess myself.",

It\u2019s so exciting.\n\nI think ultimately which you pick depends on what you want to get out of the course. I had some considerations -\n\n\u2022 I\u2019m from a theatre background and this was my main consideration. I managed to speak to someone from the KCL MA course and she was from a theatre background too, and dissatisfied because the course was geared mainly towards visual arts + heritage management. I also got in touch with a student from Goldsmiths MA course and she was v satisfied with the theatre exposure she got from the course.\n\n\u2022 I\u2019ve been working for 4 years, and I do want to try create a career for myself in London. Work experience is therefore v important to me. Work placements are compulsory for Goldsmiths, and are self-sourced for KCL. From what I know, KCL doesn\u2019t have a lot of support for you to self-source placements.\n\n\u2022 I get to have the best of both worlds at Goldsmiths - a dissertation AND a work placement! \n\n\u2022 Goldsmiths has industry speakers come in frequently and this I really liked.\n\n\u2022 I\u2019m gathering and getting the feeling that Goldsmiths\u2019 practice is very\u2026 \u201con the ground\u201d and hands on and you get lots of opportunities to try. KCL is more theoretical. I think ultimately policymaking is not my first choice of a career (I\u2019m currently Company Manager for a theatre company) and so i favour the hands-on over theory.\n\n\u2022 Goldsmiths is an arts college and they are known for their strength in the arts. KCL doesn\u2019t just have that same rep for the arts, although KCL is a stronger school all around. \n\nOf course, that\u2019s not to say Goldsmiths is without its problems. They have been striking rather frequently because of cuts to the admin team and if i\u2019m not wrong, history + creative writing depts. So that\u2019s defo something to take note. Classes aren\u2019t technically \u201ccancelled\u201d, coz they do have teach outs but it\u2019s just not quite the same yknow? \n\nWould you mind sharing w me your considerations and what\u2019s making you lean towards accepting KCL?",

I think my logic was a bit less solid than yours because I dont exactly know yet what I want to do, just I know in the fields of the arts.\n\n\u2022 I actually graduated from design for art direction at UAL last summer, and i\u2019ve only ever been in an arts university (for my foundation as well). It was super fine artsy, despite the word \u2018design\u2019 in the name. So I feel like I would like to get away from that, i think art schools have a certain mindset and point-of-view to them which I\u2019ve come to embody but need breaking out of.\n\n\u2022 I also got an impression that KCL was more institution/visual arts based on their partnerships, so I leaned towards that - compared to Goldsmiths which their course leader specialises in Drama.\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s also the less concerning logistics part that KCL is easier to travel to from my home in London and super central. Goldsmiths is a 40+ minute bus ride.\n\n\u2022 I\u2019ve experienced the strike and \u2018for-profit\u2019 arts school at UAL and it just feels suffocating to think i\u2019d go back to that. There were \u2018teach outs\u2019 but definitely not the same as actual lessons, which really affected my grades. With the situation in Goldsmiths, i don\u2019t think it will get any better anytime soon. They recently hired a management company to help them turn profit.\n\nI think all in all it\u2019s down to that i no longer want to be in an arts school (or one very orientated to it) and the partnerships. I have you\u2019ve had more talks with people from the courses though \ud83d\ude05 i couldn\u2019t find anyone. I feel like i would enjoy both courses tbh, so in a sense this was a game of ticking the boxes for me. \n\nCan i ask where you are based?",

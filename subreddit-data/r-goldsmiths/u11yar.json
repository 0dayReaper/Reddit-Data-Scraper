    "postText": "I\u2019m feeling super unsure, and kind of embarrassed. I recently had an interview for Goldsmiths Fine Art degree. I didn\u2019t do the art foundation, I mainly applied at unis that didn\u2019t require it. I applied at two that did, one (UAL) rejected me straight away without asking for my portfolio (expected), Goldsmiths asked to see my portfolio. So I thought\u2026but I didn\u2019t do the foundation year? Maybe I\u2019ve been reading requirements wrong (I\u2019ve looked at different sources). I expected to be striked out straight away. But anyway I showed them my online portfolio as requested and got invited for an interview. I still felt uncertain and went anyway. Could it have been an error that they asked me to interview when I don\u2019t even have a foundation year? \nThe interview went fine I suppose but I couldn\u2019t help but feel like an imposter the entire time. The interviewers (three of them - one tutor two students I believe) and other students/faculty were lovely but I had this insecurity I was being frowned upon (again, probably a self-inflicted issue). I had the foundation year issue clouded over me. They asked me about my foundation year then I broke it to them, then sort of explained to them the lack of foundation year. I felt super awkward haha. But hey. \nI was thinking even after the interview \u2014 Why was I asked to come in the first place? It literally took over my whole day. I completely discredited myself because of the lack of foundation year. Surely they could have rejected me before seeing my portfolio as well? Do they not screen that initially? How does admissions work? I don\u2019t doubt my work but I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re adamant on foundation years, and that they won\u2019t request a portfolio if you don\u2019t have one, let alone look at it. Do they have exceptions? I heard that the exceptions are pretty rare\u2026\n\nI have also applied to foundation years this year\u2026 still awaiting decisions but the reason I didn\u2019t do one initially is I originally started university abroad (another fine/studio art course) and didn\u2019t need the art foundation (wasn\u2019t a requirement). Nothing wrong with the course, just covid and circumstances that made me consider restarting an art degree in the U.K. also I want a full experience. \n\nSorry I\u2019m still overthinking this. I\u2019m not sure how to feel even though the interview wasn\u2019t terrible I still have mixed feelings. And lots of nerves haha.",

A similar problem happened to me two years ago during my initial applications but not at goldsmiths. They told me to submit my portfolio after having rejected my application without seeing my portfolio.",

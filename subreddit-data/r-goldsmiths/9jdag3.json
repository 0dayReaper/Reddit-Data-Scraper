    "postText": "Hi, I am looking for information related to Music Masters programs. I have a question particularly for international students. Were you guys able to find work in London after graduation? Do international Goldsmith's music/media grads manage to find work in London or it's wishful thinking?\n\nSome info about me:\n\nRather than looking for a traditional Musicology course, I am looking for something more open and experimental, where exploring other mediums is also encouraged. Please keep in mind that I do not have a Bachelor's in Music. My Bachelor's was in Communication Design and Filmmaking. However, I have a decent portfolio of personal and commercial original music, sound design and have also had a couple of exhibitions as a sound artist.\n\nI am particularly impressed by the music courses offered at Goldsmith's. Here are some examples:\n\n[https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/mmus-creative-practice/](https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/mmus-creative-practice/)\n\n[https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/mmus-sonic-arts/](https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/mmus-sonic-arts/)\n\n[https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/mmus-popular-music/](https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/mmus-popular-music/)\n\nThank you for reading this and I will be incredibly thankful to anyone who can help me out with this.",

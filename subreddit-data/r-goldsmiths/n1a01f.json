    "postText": "Asking for a friend. Her question below. \n\n\"Hi everyone. I've gotten unconditional offers from both SOAS and Goldsmiths for MA Gender Studies and MA in Gender, Media and Culture respectively. However, I was quite silly and didn't apply for scholarships on time and now funding is an issue (international student from India). I'd love to accept the offer from either of these universities but I'm also worried about being able to manage studies and a part time job. Also caught between both these universities. If anyone could give me any input on what they know of these two universities, the respective programmes, and managing work and studies and finances, it would really help.\n(I'm planning to do my Ph.D later too and I'll need to find a scholarship for that as well so it's very overwhelming)\n(also applied to Sussex and they haven't gotten back to me yet, but that seems like a better option financially, thoughts?\"",

            "comment": "Congratulations on both the offers! I went to Goldsmiths for my master's in music, and my partner is currently doing their PhD in SOAS. I had a great student experience at Goldsmiths and it's pretty left leaning and queer friendly. SOAS is pretty much the same too, and I believe the student body is pretty vocally for decolonisation, which is pretty cool. \n\nA key difference between both places for you will be the choice of modules you'll have and the supervisors you'll have access to. If you haven't already, do some research on this. If you're able to find one (or few) supervisor(s) whose work you really like, or you think will be a good fit for you, it might be worth reaching out to them. I say this especially because this will be of use to you when you do apply for a PhD programme. Having a good, supportive, and invested supervisor is key. Your funding opportunities may also significantly improve. \n\nCampus wise, Goldsmiths has a nice, big campus by London standards. SOAS is a bit smaller, and shares quite a bit with UCL and Birkbeck. Goldsmiths is in New Cross, so a bit away from Central London, but still very happening and colourful. SOAS is in central London, which is expensive, but you also have the perks of having access to some of the best libraries and other facilities. \n\nBoth places have their own set of cons as well. \n\nAs for scholarships, Goldsmiths has a Goldsmiths International Scholarship, and bunch of other ones that you'll be eligible for. Check them out on the uni website. I'm not sure about SOAS, but check on their site too. External scholarships are also available, like JN TATA, Chevening, etc. \n\nGood luck and I hope you pick what's best for you!",

I'm not really sure of the pathway you've mentioned so I'm sorry about that! Overall, I personally really like the music department. They're pretty helpful and supportive, and I really enjoyed taking the Studio Practice module (falls under the Sonic Arts pathway) in addition to modules in my own pathway. I did have the choice to take an Audio Visual Composition module but I chose another one instead. What are the modules your master's will offer you? Also, what kind of a music module are you interested in? Are you learning towards musicology/ethnomusicology or something performance/production based?",

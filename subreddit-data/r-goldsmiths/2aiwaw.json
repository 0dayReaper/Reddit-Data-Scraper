    "postText": "I applied for the MA in Sociocultural Linguistics program at Goldsmiths and am currently comparing offers form different universities. I received offers from universities that are higher on the league tables, but I'm still pretty lost. Goldsmiths isn't even on the linguistics league tables, but for some reason, my heart wants it because I feel I would \"enjoy\" my studies there more. I guess its reputation as an \"arty\" school got to me. I also hear that they challenge students and encourage them to be critical and controversial. I received offers from Leicester, Birkbeck and Queen Mary. I'm also expecting to hear from UCL, SOAS and King's College London. UCL would be my first choice, but I can't wait much longer because I need to start processing my student visa.\n\nWhat was your experience at Goldsmiths like? What were the courses like? And what about campus life? Teachers? Research? And what about its location?\n\nAny Sociocultural Linguistics students around?\n\nThanks a lot!",

            "comment": "UCL is a top linguistics school but not for sociolinguistics.  Leicester is very good for socio, and Kings is especially good for socio oriented discourse studies.  Birkbeck is very good for bilingualism and neurolinguistics and a very good all round school with absolutely brilliant teaching as well as some very impressive researchers in specific areas (Lorch and Dewaele are the two I'm thinking of).  SOAS is excellent for general linguistics, asian languages (of course) and endangered languages and documentation.  \n\nGoldsmiths is a great school for teaching and for general ethos but it doesn't pack the clout of other London schools.  It will be cheaper and you will generally have a good time - it's in a rather funky run down part of London but transport is fantastic.  Although it doesn't really rank academically, it does always rank for teaching and student experience.\n\nI think if you want to do sociolinguistics, then Leicester, Kings for academics and Goldsmiths for overall experience.",

I'd like my thesis to be in sociolinguistics. I might change my mind later on of course, but for now, sociolinguistics is my preference. Since I haven't heard from UCL or King's yet, I might have to narrow down my choices to Goldsmiths and Queen Mary. Do you know anything about QM? What do you think of it? I believe they have a Sociolinguistics Research Group, and  Sociolinguistic Theory is one of their compulsory modules. ",

Generally they are a very strong school in linguistics.  The campus is further out than the others and although it's quite nice environmentally I think Goldsmiths is better for local facilities and transport (Goldsmith's is ten minutes form central london by train and ten minutes walk to Greenwich).  QMU has a better academic rating than Goldsmiths.",

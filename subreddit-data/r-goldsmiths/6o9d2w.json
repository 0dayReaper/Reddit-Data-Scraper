    "postText": "Researchers at Goldsmiths, University of London are recruiting paid volunteers to investigate whether a very mild, non-invasive form of brain stimulation can improve mood and the ability to identify positive and negative emotions. The study has been designed by Dr. Rebecca Charlton, Dr. Carys Evans, and their team in the department of Psychology. \n\nIn order to participate, you should be healthy, and must not be currently undergoing treatment for depression or other mood disorders. You should also fit into one of the two following age groups: 20-40 years old, or over 60 years old. \n\nThe study involves two testing sessions at Goldsmiths University. The first will be approximately one and a half hours, where we will ask about your general health and background, take your blood pressure, and measure your memory and thinking abilities. The second will be a shorter session, where we will again ask you to complete a few tasks measuring memory and thinking abilities. \n\nDuring one of the sessions, we will perform brain stimulation using a technique called transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). During the other, electrodes will be placed but no stimulation will occur. This allows us to examine the effect of stimulation for each person individually. \n\ntES has been used safely in thousands of individuals around the world. However, there are some safety considerations which will be examined in more detail should you decide to take part. \n\nParticipants will be compensated \u00a320 for their time, paid at the end of the two sessions. \n\nIf this study interests you, contact Adam Claessens (Research Assistant at Goldsmiths University) using the following email: aclae001@gold.ac.uk",

One of the primary principles we stand for as a party is Net Neutrality. Because of this, I am here today to ask for your vote. The fight for Net Neutrality needs a strong voice in our parliament. Changes such as universally free internet can be achieved, but we need like minded people to support us.\n\nI am standing in the South &amp;amp; East Yorkshire Constituency, however you should consider voting for our other candidates, some of which are situated in :-\n\n* West Midlands\n* Birmingham, Coventry and Wolverhampton\n* Lesser Wessex\n* Lanc., Merseyside &amp;amp; Ches.\n* South and East Yorkshire\n* South London\n\n## **[Here is our manifesto.](https://np.reddit.com/r/MHOCPress/comments/3ngec4/geiv_pirate_party_manifesto/)**\n\n##**[And visit /r/MHoC to vote in the General Election!](https://np.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/3ni7z5/general_election_iv_megathread/)**\n**Thanks,**\n\n**The /r/MHoC Pirate Party**",

    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI'm a high school senior in Portland, OR and I'm toying with the idea of getting my BA in Anthropology from Goldsmiths, beginning next fall, however I can't help but be nervous. There are many things I'm worried about; the most pressing of these is that London is known as one of the loneliest cities in the world. I understand that living in one of the halls helps this, but I still have my fears. I also understand that Goldsmiths has an atmosphere composed of artsy, politically engaged kids: a description that makes me smile. I feel an affinity with that general sphere, and I love the city. I suppose I'm just looking for someone to talk to. Let me know if you're free to talk or leave your thoughts.",

            "comment": "You\u2019ll never be lonely at uni, it\u2019s designed to encourage making friends. I\u2019ve never found London particularly lonely, just very cold. It\u2019s a big step to travel across the world to study but I guarantee you\u2019ll find lovely people. You\u2019ll be in halls, have tonnes of classes and have access to societies that\u2019ll help you find people with similar interests. You\u2019ll be fine :) \n\nOne thing I will say about goldsmiths is that their mental health services are abysmal. I\u2019d be worried about travelling so far and not having the support system of friends and family. You might never experience a mh problem while you\u2019re studying, so this might not apply, but if this is something relevant it might be worth thinking about.",

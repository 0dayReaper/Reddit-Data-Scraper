    "postText": "Hello there, I'm going to Goldsmiths in like a month and I've gotten a place at Raymont Hall. I haven't decided on it yet because... I have another housing option.\n\nI have an older sister and cousin living in central London and I could stay with them. They live like north-east of Hyde Park. It's about 45 minutes to school and it takes three different trains to get down. That's a rather comparable distance.\n\nThe central London house sounds really great but am I missing out if I stay there? I can't decide. What if I have like one hour of class and I have to come all the way down just for that? What if I become the household maid cause I'm the youngest?!\n\nGive me some pros and cons of my choices!",

You can always go and live in central in your second year, but in your first year it will be so beneficial to be near your friends, near your lectures, near the pubs. Brockley is lovely, I lived there for two of my three years at Goldsmiths, and New Cross is great fun.",

I am an international student who has also received housing at Raymont Hall, and although I'm excited, I am having trouble trying to dig deep into the area and what the halls are really like. Cheers.",

Like a lot of places in London, the people there are a real mix, but there's a good amount of Goldsmiths students, and to be honest, these are the people you'll probably be mixing with mostly. It's not far from the campus at all, which is great, and there are buses that go straight to central London that run all night, so that's really convenient. There's also an Overground station that will take you directly to Shoreditch, and links up to the Underground. There are a lot of independent cafes and shops. Some of them are dodgy, some of them are really nice, and it gives the area a really local feel.\n\nCons would be, I suppose, that you're not right in the middle of things. But that doesn't really matter as much as you think. By second and third year, most people on my course had moved out to Peckham, which is much further away. Also, I don't know about you but the idea of Halls never really appealed to me. I lived in a house for my whole time at Goldsmiths and it was cheaper, I was much closer to my housemates, and we had more freedom to basically do whatever we wanted in terms of parties and having people stay over.",

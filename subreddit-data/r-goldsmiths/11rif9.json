    "postText": "I'm especially interested in studying with Bernard Stiegler. Do students get sufficient time with him, or are his classes short along with limited office hours offered?\n\nAlso, what kind of production gear is available to students? A few of the videos posted as examples of student's work were posted in SD 4:3 format rather than HD 16:9, which is a bit disconcerting. I see the filmmaking students can shoot with REDs, are these available to all media students? \n\nAny good courses in the field of continental philosophy? I'm particularly interested in Bernard Stiegler, Jacques Derrida, Martin Heidegger, Nietzsche and Avital Ronell. Also the Frankfurt school fascinates me.\n\nAnything else people think I should know about the program?\n\nThanks!",

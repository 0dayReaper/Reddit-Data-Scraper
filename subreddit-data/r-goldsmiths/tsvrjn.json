    "postText": "hi! I am an international student and I applied and got offered the course BA Curating at Goldsmiths! I am still trying to decide on whether to accept the offer or not\ud83d\ude05\n\nI wanted to ask what is the student culture like there? As well as how are the teachers like? (Especially for those that are in the visual cultures department) If there are any curating students that don\u2019t mind sharing their experiences, that would be helpful! \n\nAlso, I read the article about the whole boycotting incident, I was wondering if the issue is still as bad as it was portrayed in the article?",

This term I\u2019ve over half my classes because of teachers striking. The uni in is a lot of debt since the pandemic and I wouldn\u2019t expect the striking to get any better soon.",

I regret going to goldsmiths mainly because I didn\u2019t enjoy the culture there, covid did start in my first year so that really effected things. But I was 18 when I started and everyone I lived with where atleast a year or two older than me. There isn\u2019t the same sense of community like at other unis, there\u2019s not really many clubs around so it\u2019s not like there\u2019s place to go with only goldsmiths students.",

    "postText": "Hey there - \n\nI\u2019m currently at the uni of edinburgh for music (second year) - highly ranked course at a very highly ranked &amp; prestigious university etc etc. \n\nI\u2019m very interested in transferring to Goldsmiths uni though. I\u2019m a classical Pianist and composer and i\u2019m highly dedicated to being an artist and that being my career. Edinburgh is not\u2026 exactly tailored to that kind of aspiration in my opinion. It\u2019s very traditional, bread and butter, and sparse in opportunities for collaboration and performance. However i\u2019ve been exposed to only the posh and frankly uncreative people from the doomed pollock halls of residence. There is something to be said for the small music department at Edinburgh though and how underdeveloped it is sadly. \n\nGoldsmiths is not nearly as prestigious as Edinburgh from what I\u2019ve been reading but it probably would be a better fit for me. \n\nI also think Edinburgh as a city is pretty miserable for a music student as there\u2019s practically no art scene. I adore London and want to live there.\n\nDoes anybody have any advice? Or could give me a read of Goldsmiths?",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I've applied for a place on the MA Comouter Games Art and Design for this September and after a bit of a mix up with my portfolio, got an email from the course leader saying he will recommend my admission to the course and that an official acceptance letter will follow. Its been a couple of days now and I've not heard anything from the uni, and my student application portal hasn't updated either so I can't officially accept my place or apply for SLC finance. Any ideas how long it's likely to be before I hear officially from the uni? Is it just the A-level fiasco that's making it take longer or does it usually take a while? Thank you!",

            "comment": "My experience of universities so far in life is that unless you chase people, nothing will get done. it might be worth giving it 3-4 days after the call / email you had and getting on the phone or sending an email out to the same person, just to give them a gentle nudge.\n\nIf you've had confirmation from the course admin, there's no reason to not believe that you're on the course; making that a reality might just require that you put a bit of pressure on though.\n\nCongrats on your placement! Goldsmiths is a really nice uni in an interesting part of london! Be sure to check out the Jerk Chicken place ('Comin' Up')... Place serves banging food!",

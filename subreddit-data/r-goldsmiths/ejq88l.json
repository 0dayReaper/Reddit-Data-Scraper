            "comment": "[TG0](https://tg0.co.uk) is a London based startup company, founded by RCA and Imperial graduates - Ming Kong and Liucheng Guo. \n\nTG0 is a sensing technology company that is disrupting the way in which technology is integrated in Human-Machine Interfaces(HMIs) by turning inert materials into smartly designed intuitive gestural user interfaces. We took that technology and created the etee controllers.\n\netee is a five finger controller that TG0 is developing as a self initiated project. While traditional controllers use binary buttons, etee allows for gestural and grip-based controls. A compact, lightweight and approachable form factor enables broad use cases across various use cases. From gaming, to AR/VR, location based experiences, corporate training, mobility, aviation, robotics, manufacturing, healthcare, smarthome and automotive.\n\nWe will soon be launching it via kickstarter.

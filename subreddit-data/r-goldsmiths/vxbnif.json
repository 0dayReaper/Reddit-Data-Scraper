    "postText": "Hi guys! I\u2019m an MSc clinical psychology student searching for participants for my dissertation on attachment insecurity and intolerance of uncertainty on mental health during the pandemic. If you are interested in taking part, you must be over 18, fluent in English, and have lived in the UK during the pandemic from March 2020 - May 2020. I would highly appreciate the responses as it will help me and other psychologists gain insight into how psychological treatment can be tailored to depression and anxiety caused/elevated by the pandemic. It shouldn\u2019t take more than 10 minutes to complete! Thank you in advance! And if you need me to complete a survey, send them my way \ud83d\ude0a \n\n[https://goldpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eEirXevb2s7xofY](https://goldpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eEirXevb2s7xofY)",

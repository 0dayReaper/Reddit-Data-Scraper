    "postText": "Hi there, this might be a silly question but I don't understand what they mean with some of the vocabulary they use when describing the accommodations (foreign student here hihi). I'm a postgrad student looking for something for postgrads, already been through the loud and noisy phase of undergrad life\u2026.\n\nFor example in Dean House they say that \"Each flat contains the ensuite rooms and one kitchen.  All the rooms in the hall are for single occupancy\"; so flat meaning apartment, got that, but what is an ensuite room exactly? that its connected to another room or something?\n\nWhats the difference between a flat and a self-contained flat? \nfor example in the Raymont Hall description they say \"Raymont Hall Main houses students over 5 corridors.  Each floor has two to three kitchens depending on the size and each bedroom on the floor has an ensuite room.  Edgecombe contains 3 self-contained flats and Manse contains four self-contained flats.  Each room has an ensuite room and there is one kitchen in each flat.\"\n\nLastly, for Batavia Mews they say \"How many people will I share with?\nBatavia Mews is made up of 13 self-contained flats. The flats can accommodate between 7-20 people depending on the size. Seven bed flats share one kitchen and two bathrooms.\" --&gt; does this mean they are 20 people in one apartment?? O_o \n\nany clarification will help tons! xx\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "Ensuite means an ensuite bathroom, an ensuite room room will have a private bathroom attached to it - instead of there being communal bathroom(s) shared between the flat.\n\nI'm not sure I'm definitely right here but I would assume that 'self-contained' means that it is only you in the flat.\nAnd finally, yes, it does mean that between 7 and 20 people will be per flat, but the kitchens are fitted accordingly and of course everyone has their own room.

            "comment": "I lived in Batavia there is one flat of 20 and the rest are of 7. The one flat that had 20 people in it has 2 kitchens and more bathrooms to accommodate. \n\nThe flats of 7 are over 3 floors there is a bathroom on each floor one with a shower, one with a bath and one just with a toilet and sink.\n\nIf you have any more questions pm me. Happy to help.",

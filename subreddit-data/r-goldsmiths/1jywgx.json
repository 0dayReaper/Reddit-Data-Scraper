    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a student from the US and I'll be coming to Goldsmiths to study abroad from September to December. I'm wondering what the costs of living are in the Goldsmith's area, as I'm trying to figure out my budget while I'm abroad. I've got a phone plan and an Oyster card lined up, now it's just incidentals like food, drinks, and other things. I'm also hoping to do some traveling during the weekends while I'm there. What does it cost you guys to live in the area? With what I was planning to spend while I'm abroad I should have about  \u00a3200/week, for someone that has lived there does that sound like too much, too little, what do you think? Thanks for the help, can't wait for September to come around!!",

Mostly expect to pay double for everything since the pound is worth ore than the dollar and your living in a big city. ",

            "comment": "\u00a3200 a week is definitely more than enough. Most of your expenditure will probably come down to food - find some cheap hearty meal recipes online(emphasis on the hearty aspect for winter) and make them in bulk, if possible cook giant meals with your roommates as this will also reduce the cost. \n\nDrink everywhere in London is expensive compared to the rest of the UK. There are however some cheap ways to get around this such as buying beer from supermarkets rather than pubs. The New Cross Inn also offers a half price happy hour 7-8PM every weekday meaning you can get pints for \u00a31.80-\u00a32.20 instead of the usual \u00a33.50-\u00a34.50. The Student Union also does very cheap drink although the atmosphere in both of these places can often be found to be lacking. \n\nAs a typical rule of thumb with London, the further into the centre you go, the higher the price goes up. So be wary of that :)\n",

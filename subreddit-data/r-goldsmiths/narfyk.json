    "postText": "Hi so I\u2019m struggling between Media&amp; Anthropology at Goldsmiths and Contemporary Media Cultures(formerly known as Media n Cultural studies) at UAL (LCC). My major concern is that I really do have a wide range of interest in all sorts of arts, where the lack of minors in ual is making me reconsider and leaning more towards Goldsmiths. They have workshops but I\u2019m not too sure how they work. That said, UAL does generally have a better international reputation and probably connections, whereas I am not really aware of goldsmiths before doing my research. As I\u2019m not from UK, I\u2019d really like some advice on each\u2019s pros and cons or why one would choose one over the other, if possible. Thank you very much for all your input\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

Check the course contents, you don\u2019t want to get little knowledge on many things, there should really be a lean towards something, which I guess Goldsmith\u2019s offers. Both unis have a good international reputation, Goldsmith\u2019s is more of a community though I\u2019d say.",

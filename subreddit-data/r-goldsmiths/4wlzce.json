Plus it doesn't have the whole student accommodation feeling to it with sterile rooms and hallways without end. \nThat said, it's definitely not the cleanest or most hygienic place (in the beginning of the year, they used to call it ratavia. Which I guess is self-explanatory)\n\nIf you pm me, I can put you in touch with someone who's living there, but she's not on reddit, so fb/mail or something has to make due.",

    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI'll be doing a one-year masters degree at Goldsmiths this September so right now I am thinking of where to stay. Basically I have the option to try for a place in a dorm or in a flat in the area. However I am not sure if the student dorms are more for younger students (I am 26). Not that I want to seem arrogant or anything, but I've been told that it's mostly the fresh students (\u2248 18-20yr olds) living in there and I am afraid that I might not feel overly appropriate. On the other side I've never experienced \"campus life\" which is something that I think is definitely worth experiencing once in your life. \n\n\nDo you guys have any experience about living in the halls of residence of Goldsmiths (Mansion View, Wharf etc.)?\nThank you so much for your input!",

If you want to experience campus life the furthest out I would suggest going is Surrey house although Raymont is only a 20 minute walk from campus.",

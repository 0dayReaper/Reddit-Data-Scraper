    "postText": "I am a crafter, artist and Goldsmith. The majority of my work requires me to be in bad posture positions, often hunched over leaning forward. I have Fibromyalgia as well as MPS and when I got back into the more intensive techniques after a year of hiatus, I was struck down with debilitating ribcage and sternum pain. During my studies as a Goldsmith I had to quit in my final semester because of a health crisis which was largely the terrible chest pain. \n\n\nI'm applying for bench jeweller position for a local jewellery buisness and I desperately need this job as I'm too disabled to do much other type of work but I don't know if I can if the pain seems to be caused by sitting in those positions for hours. \n\n\nBut I remembered my teacher had a camera system set up over her bench to show her work on a larger screen for our demonstrations and I thought to myself maybe I could set up a system so that I don't have to hunch over but sit upright and look forward at the screen without needing to look at my actual hands. \n\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on equipment setups that I can use that don't take up too much space on the working area and are not too expensive? Thank you!",

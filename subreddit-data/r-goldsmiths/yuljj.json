I lived in Loring Hall the first year so I have a few tips:\n\n1, There are two entrances/exits to Loring, one that leads to the street (next to Loring Hall management centre) the other to the New Academic Building/Main field.\n2, If you take the latter exit you will notice the laundry building, its open 7.30am till 10pm I believe. \n3, If anything breaks or stops working, straight to the Loring Hall management centre you go to fill in a maintenance report, should be fixed in less than a day. If not spam them to hell over it! \n4, Bring a small Ethernet cable with you or pay \u00a33 on the day to get one at your peril. \n5, Internet/Goldsmiths User registration takes place in the library. \n\nThis was what I experienced last year, may have changed now however but I doubt it. If there's anything else you want to ask about let me know.",

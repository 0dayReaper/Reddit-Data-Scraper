I would like to hammer and work at all hours of the day including at night if I really want something finished. I also want to use my flexshaft and tumblers and other somewhat noisy tools/equipment. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips to minimize sound so that my neighbors don't hate me and I'm not disrupting anyone?",

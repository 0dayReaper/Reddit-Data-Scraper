Is it any good the course and the uni itself?\n\n* Which is the best accommodation for fun but I don't have to share a toilet and shower?\n\n* What's New Cross like?\n\nI did come to the open day and did enjoy it but I was there very brief. I like the idea of multiple topics within the course and the location of the university.\n\nAny extra information would be cool :)",

            "comment": "I can't comment on the course (I'm in English) but the uni is lovely, best choice I made, every one is really friendly and very artsy!\nThe uni is a very well respected uni, especially for the arts and media so if you want to work in media its a pretty good call to go there. \nIts worth looking at a few newspaper uni guides to see what you think too.\n\n I'm also living in private accommodation, but I have friends in the Loring hall and they say its pretty lively there.\n\nNew Cross itself is super lively, if you want live music there's a massive music scene in the amersham arms and new cross inn (Blur actually met at goldsmiths and returned a couple of years back for a reuinion gig). There's also a good choice of clubs, and in the day lots of cafe's you can chill at. There's two train stations, so it's well connected into London (4 mins on a train to London bridge for example), and loads of night buses go to new cross so it's always easy to get home.\n\nI'm almost 25 and I was worried that I was too old for uni, but being at Goldsmiths has made me feel really young and fun again, I haven't stopped smiling since I started.  I know I sound like an advert for the uni, but its a great place. I think the only complaint I've heard is that there's no longer a jazz piano in one of the lecture halls! \n\n\n",

There are some points I'm not a great fan of, but really they're minor quibbles.\n\nI did not particularly enjoy Loring Hall, but if you're looking for fun and your own bathroom, I would recommend it. It would appear that I have a very different definition of fun to my ex-flatmates - they were the \"stay up until the sun comes up listening to hipster music stupidly loudly, breaking all the rules and not owning up to it\" kind of people. They seemed to enjoy themselves though.\n\nThe best thing about New Cross is it's transport links. It's really quick to get to pastures greener. New Cross great, if you like pubs and the SU. I do not, but I seem to be the exception.",

            "comment": "Hey there! Third year media and comms student here :) I came to Goldsmiths a bit randomly, hadn't even been to an open day but after the initial adaptation period (Goldsmiths is... special, you need an adaptation period) I started really enjoying it. Goldsmith is probs the best decision I've ever made!\n\nAs for the course, I really enjoy it. Don't know what you're into specifically but I specialise in journalism and the teaching I've had has been extremely good quality. I'm looking into masters at the moment and some stuff even City do we've studied more thoroughly already. There is a great emphasis on letting people be creative on the course, some excellent modules with top notch lecturers (eg you get James Curran in first year) and if you're interested in journo especially it's a fantastic place to study as it's where the Centre for Media Reform originated so lots of Leveson discussion around. There are also shit lectures but eh. (Don't take the music course in third year. Just don't.)\n\nBest accom would be Loring, Dean House or Chesterman imo. All are ensuite are very close to uni which means close to the SU and pubs. I was in Loring which are the largest halls and certainly knows how to party. \n\nNew X is cool. As Goldsmiths, it might need a couple months of getting used to but now I can't see myself leaving SE London tbh. There are some really great pubs (Royal Albert especially, and New Cross House tad pricy but excellent food), lots of nice food places for all price ranges, there's often stuff to do on campus since the SU is quite active but you're also close to nice dynamic places (Brockley, Deptford, Greenwich, Telegraph Hill + Hilly Fields parks.)\n\nHope this can help and let me know if you have any specific questions!",

I would probably end up doing animation, photography, and creative writing, then film in the second.\n\nWhat are the prospects like for students when finding work? Does Goldsmiths have many ties? I know you have to find it on its own but like other unis have work experience with the BBC etc.",

I know less about that but I don't know anyone who's not enjoying their practice apart from a few creative writing students - but then others love it... I think it also depends how much you put in etc. \n\nGoldsmiths doesn't do work experience and as far as I know you're pretty much on your own to get one, unless of course you get along with a tutor and they're willing to help you I guess. My journo tutor helped me get an internship at a mag but that was solely because I asked him to put in a good word for me to an alumni who worked there. \n\nAs for work post-degree I'm not sure since I'm still in my degree but they have a career service apparently helpful (haven't been) and some graduate schemes within college plus a list of others I think. Also the media dept get sent emails about internships and jobs all the time and forward them to all students. ",

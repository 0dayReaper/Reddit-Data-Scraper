They were typically young woman and it's awful to think they're in this position. I'm waiting for my third year results (as a late summer deferral student) and I'm not surprised they're taking so long if a fifth of markers are striking. My time at Goldsmiths was littered with teachers refusing to work because of the way they were treated. What I found most infuriating was the way management slyly pitted us against them with the information they sent out. We all spent a good few weeks feeling betrayed and angry because of the rhetoric fed to us before we realised our tutors were just protesting large pension cuts. I chose Goldsmiths because it was touted as a progressive university but public perception is changing fast. In the last ten years it's fallen way down league tables and dissatisfaction in student surveys reflect how wide the gulf between the academic and economic sectors of our uni is.",

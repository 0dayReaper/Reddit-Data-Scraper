Do any of you know if it's possible to pay monthly instead?\n\nI'm not from UK, so don't know how everything works there. Hope you can help me.\n\nAnd how is it there?\n\n",

            "comment": "I think it's quite standard to pay for rooms in halls of residence termly, as that's when people's student loans come in. If you want to pay monthly it might be worth looking into renting a room in a private house instead. That's what I did when I was there and it was cheaper and nicer I think. The student's union usually hosts events to help people meet others looking for accommodation and helps them find it too.",

    "postText": "I have recently been admitted to Goldsmiths' MA Race, Media, and Social Justice Program. Although I am quite excited to attend, I have recently been deemed semi-finalist for the Fulbright to study at the University of Sussex in Media and Cultural Studies. \n\nFor those who are already attending Goldsmiths or who are similar predicaments like me, would it be crazy to possibly turn down a Fulbright to study at Sussex to go to Goldsmiths? Even though the program at Goldsmiths is better?\n\nThoughts?",

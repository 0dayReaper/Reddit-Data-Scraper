    "postText": "Hi! I have been looking for this information online but cannot find the stuff I need hopefully aomeone could help me! Thank you!\n\nWhat are the differences between stidying an MA/MSc in Anthropology in Goldsmiths vs UCL vs LSE? I have been admitted to all three however I don't quite know which one would fit best with me. I am trying to find all the comparisons pros and cons possible but cant find any. I am very interdisciplinary artistically and at the same time very academic and expect to be challenged during my masters.",

LSE and UCL are obvs more central, but as an ex-SOASian I'm biased against LSE. (There's a longstanding rivalry between them for... Some reason, idk LSE is full of posh people, and SOAS is full of posh people that pretend with all their might that they're not posh)",

The atmosphere is great, the support from teachers and other students was perfect, and the facilities are exceptional. \n\nWhat pathway are you choosing? \n\nWyatt are your research interests? Research as Goldsmiths is probably more focused on Liberal Arts and proper philosophy, but they had some really great post-colonial post-modern course when I was there.\n\n\nI don't know anything about KCL so I can't comment on that.

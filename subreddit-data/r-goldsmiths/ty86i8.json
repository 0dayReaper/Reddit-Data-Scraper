    "postText": "hi i applied and was accepted into the fine arts course at goldsmiths. i was wondering if any fine art students could share their experiences there. im a bit worried about the strikes going on right now, would you say they have impacted studio courses much? i know fine art does not have many classes to begin with and it is all largely independent work but has it greatly reduced the number of critiques and ability to get feedback from professors? thanks for the advice",

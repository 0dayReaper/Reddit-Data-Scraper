I think you are most likely to have your degree awarded by the University of London, with a note that the academic direction was provided by Goldsmiths.\n\nThe program is very new so I don't think there is a lot of feedback to find. There are improvements being made to individual courses.\n\nGood luck with whatever you choose!\n\nSource: Information Systems student who had the option of transferring over to the CS programme.",

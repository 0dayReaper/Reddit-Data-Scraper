            "comment": "Its an intentional design ploy [apparently]. The lack of stackability means that largely Heinz needs its own shelf and a large surface area at that in order to safely store the cans. Meaning the most likely brand to be clearly visible in a shop. All about brand visibility.\n\n[Edit]\n\n\nI did a bit of research (hello Google;) because obviously this topic is a matter of utmost importance to our very existence. \n\n\"A Heinz spokesperson said its cans were designed for minimal environmental impact, with an underside which allowed a can opener to be used. The cans were not intended for stacking, Heinz said, and suggested placing a whole tray on the shelf.\"",

No customers to deal with, grooving to decent music, and the group I worked with were all pretty good about helping each other out if someone was having a slow day. The job can be rough on the back though, and I definitely feel the wear and tear these days (15 years later).",

These have thicker walls, don't have ridges added for strength and tend to be shallow, like tuna fish cans.\n\nThe body of three piece cans are just a sheet of metal rolled into a tube and welded.\n\nOver a certain size and you have no choice but to make your cans three piece.  And if you don't have the quantity to justify the expensive equipment for two piece cans it also makes sense to go three piece.\n\nAlso, an important fact that dispels the idea that this is a way to monopolize shelf space: Retailers DGAF.  They won't give you extra facings because your product doesn't stack well.\n\n\nMaybe a few stores will allocate extra space but others won't and won't attempt to stack your cans either.  So you get twice as much at one store and half as much at another.\n\nIf you want extra shelf space there's two things you can do:\n\n- buy it\n\n- make your packaging larger.\n\nIn the latter case, this only works for certain products at certain stores.  Wal-Mart might refuse to sell your product if you attempt to do this in a category where it's not already common.  Or other stores might just put your product on a top shelf or turn it on its side",

One is that they had a canning machine which could only process a certain design of can, and for reasons of equipment continuity or supply chain or whatever, they kept buying canning machines which could only run the non-stackable style of can. It's also possible that no one even thought about stackable cans before 1995 or whenever. The contract manufacturers making the other brands came on the scene later and bought newer equipment from italian manufacturers.",

The Heinz can is three piece construction (separate can ends and a seamed walled container). You can see the difference if you take the label off. May be deliberate, May not be, but basically means that's the type of can the filling line can handle, and filling lines can last for 20+ years. So could just be a legacy thing. \n\nI don't buy beans at all (and I'm British! Shock, horror!) because I can't stand them but I am tempted to see if I can find two-piece Heinz cans next time I'm in a supermarket. \n\nI probably won't though.",

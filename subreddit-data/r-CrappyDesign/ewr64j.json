You can get them in any color you want as changing color does not require a retooling, just a flush of the factory line. And the text is printed either at the end of the line or even at the supplier. So a red alarm button is dirt cheep, unless you want the braille to say A as well, in which case it will cost thousands of dollars for a special order.",

However, due to his screen reader speaking loudly enough I could hear it over the phone, I was able to help him navigate to our web app and launch the service.\n\nTook an hour, but we got his email fixed. I felt like a God of IT after that.",

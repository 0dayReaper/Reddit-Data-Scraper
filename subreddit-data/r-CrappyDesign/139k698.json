It says dry hands since if they're wrapped in the transparent 'plastic' that one dissolves in water, so you should handle with dry hands \n\nIn the foil bags, you just get soap on your hands as you open it. But if I remember correctly the soap starts losing its solid shape as soon as it touches water, so it's kinda the same for both I guess",

Each is then wrapped in a foil packaging so that they won't clump together in the container you purchased them in, be it a paper box or a plastic tub. You unwrap it from the foil packaging, but leave the clear plastic wrap so that the tab doesn't fall apart in the dishwasher. Consult the manufacturer's instructions on where to put tabs at in the dishwasher, as it's not always placed in the dispenser. Hope this helps!",

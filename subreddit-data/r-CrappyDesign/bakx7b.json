It's more of the context the picture is in. \n\nThe picture is a very famous image. But it looks bizarre on this poster that is basically a compilation of NYC architecture. Like, \"here are all the really cool things you can see in New York... and down here in the corner is this one super traumatic event we all went through. Do you want pepperoni on that?\". There'd be nothing wrong with it if it was just the twin towers on there. But showing a picture of the buildings on fire with collapse imminent? In a pizza parlor? Maybe if it was like, a poster with the history of New York. Maybe.\n\nI don't know, it just rubs me the wrong way. \n\nIf I'd lost a loved one in that attack, and I was just out trying to enjoy a pizza with my family, seeing that would probably dampen my mood.",

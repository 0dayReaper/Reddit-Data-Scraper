Their entire Navy was decimated and they were very close to losing to Japan because of it. They were not going to let that happen again. Specifically the Navy and Airforce have seen the greatest spending increases. \n\nThe US became one of the few countries that has the capability to patrol sea lanes. The US relies heavily on trade and as so it spends a lot of money to guarantee that those trade routes are free to use. That doesn\u2019t just benefit the US btw. \n\nThe presence of the Navy alone deters not just pirates but smaller States from interfering with global trade. Even with such a large US presence there are entities that attempt to undermine this security. So there is no doubt that without a military presence like the US that trade would be compromised. Especially at the Suez.\n\nThe US is in every body of water around the planet 24hrs a day. That\u2019s going to always cost.\n\nAdditionally with space opening up we will have the same issue and someone will have to step up to protect shipping lanes in space. It doesn\u2019t HAVE to be the US but it likely will. China and others will also obviously have a role. So military spending is only going to increase with new sectors.\n\nNeither side wants to drastically reduce the defense budget for obvious reasons. If they\u2019re educated they know their history and the reasons why that spending was increased in the first place. They\u2019re not going to want to revert to a less secure pre-WW2 state. Both sides also recognize the importance of free trade.\n\nBut maybe even more important than that are their voters. A large cost is military personnel and their benefits. We could greatly reduce the defense budget if we cut civilian military along with their benefits. NO politician is going to eliminate all those jobs and benefits in their State.\n\nSo before just ignorantly blaming one side or looking at a number as just a number, look what\u2019s behind that number and the multiple reasons it\u2019s that high. If anyone has a better way to protect our trade security or ensure we are not decimated like we were in WW2 then let\u2019s intelligently discuss that.",

They also pay far more for research and development and the production of weapons and equipment because again, the pay rate of civilian workers and suppliers is far above what similar people get in China and Russia.",

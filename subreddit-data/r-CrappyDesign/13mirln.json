That means the part has been milled specifically for second operation polishing, or it has had a surface treatment applied to give it that look.\n\nPolishing milled stainless is an expensive process, not suitable for a gadget like this. That means chrome plating, which is an atrocious choice for something meant to take constant abuse, and it\u2019s prohibitively expensive for a gadget. \n\nMilling aluminum for a polish, and the polishing is much less expensive, but still 3x-5x more than anodizing it. The acrylic compass lens will be scratched to opaqueness or entirely broken before the anodizing is eroded away. \n\nIf you look at disposable and semi disposable stainless steel products, you\u2019ll notice that they are almost always cast, forged, or stamped. That\u2019s because obtaining a milled, fit for polish stainless surface is very expensive, as is the follow up polishing. Every single part of milling and polishing stainless adds substantial expense that results in retail pricing beyond the means of reasonable people. Making 10,000 of these, you could easily spend $3-$4 to mill that part from stainless and polish it. That\u2019s before assembly, the other components, branding and packaging. In anodized aluminum you\u2019re looking at $0.50-$0.70. \n\nAs you pointed out, no thought has gone into this product beyond selling it, and selling it in stainless for $30+ is going to be very difficult. But in aluminum you can sell it for $10-$12, and that\u2019s a reasonable price for a gadget.",

The alternative, as seen here, is BEIGE. This screams beige. This takes devout, fanatic dedication to beige. \n\nBut hey, I don't get people who only put one color of ornament on their Xmas tree, either. It seems too restrictive, forcing conformity too hard. But lots of people like HOAs too, so I'm just weird maybe.",

Books are basically just a collection of pages, and the binding only exist as a necessary \"evil\" to hold them all together.\n\nIn the early days, people would hide the bindings as they were considered unsightly, (similar to the way we tend to hide hinges or screw holes in modern furniture).\n\nIt wasn't until the 1800s when people finally started putting information on the book bindings.",

Curious.\n\nI asked the rather unfriendly and elderly librarian there about why this was, and her answer was that the disabled students didn't put them back the right way round, due to physical or mental disabilities so they left them all spine in. She didn't see why I found this an issue because to the disabled students any book will do. Why bother.\n\nI made a rather stunned face. I had never come across anything worse..... until I checked the DVD sections.\n\nThey only purchased materials for the disabled 16-18 yr olds from the Disney catalogue.\n\nI stayed a month, turned all the books spine out, secretly purchased a massive pile of john woo, teen college movies and anime DVDs and left.  What a shitshow that place was.",

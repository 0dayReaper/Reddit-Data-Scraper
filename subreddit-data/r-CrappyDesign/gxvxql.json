There was no plumbing for the house at all, no power, no running water. They had to dig wells for water or bucket it up to the house from the creek. They didnt have a shower. Theyd bathe in the same creek they got their water, did their laundry, etc.\n\nBut since it was farmland, theyd just squat and crap wherever. The cows, chickens, horses and pigs were already doing their business there anyway. Mind you, they grew up doing this, so it didnt seem weird to them. Toilets in the home just werent a thing. I think once my uncles came to America and they started getting used to things here like toilets and bathrooms that they started building them back at home when they returned.",

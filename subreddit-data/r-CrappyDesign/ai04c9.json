Like \"Don't hit yourself, hit the training bags on the 3rd floor\"\n\nBut that can't be broken up into pieces that would make sense.\n\nMaybe something about hitting yourself when you realize how much time you've wasted at other gyms once you visit the third floor?\n\nOh wait okay. Maybe something like \"Hit yourself, hit the bags at the 3rd floor. 3 months from now you'll thank us.\"\n\nThat might make sense because \"hit yourself\" sounds stupid but it's symmetrical with \"hit the bags\", and hit yourself could kinda maybe be a \"put yourself through pain for the benefits you'll see 3 months from now\"\n\nThat's the best I got.

Looks like the rest was supposed to read \"Hit us up at 3rd floor\", switching the \"us\" and \"yourself\" considering this looks like a multi-office outlet style building. Chances are whoever was doing the signage just fucked it up something major.\n\nEdit: Looks like it's RAAW gym in Pune, India. If so, [here's one of their promo videos](https://youtu.be/54XRSYgZc2s) making this step signage look like poetry. ",

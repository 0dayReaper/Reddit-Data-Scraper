Here in the states we stick to our american, local, standards instead (which say that fire exit signs are supposed to be red)\n\nIn ISO green means \"go\" or \"do\" so in a fire exit sign it's \"Go out this way\" so the sign is green. Red signs mean \"Don't\" so a red exit sign means \"Don't go this way\".\n\nIn the US, red (in signage) means \"emergency\" hence why fire exit signs are red, as are first aid kit signs, etc. Due to ISO being used (almost) everywhere else in the world, a lot of places here in the states are just using ISO or adopting a hybrid system.",

I read the ladies sign, and just didn\u2019t really think about it. \n\nThe alarm went off, but it really wasn\u2019t very dramatic. There was only one person working the front, and one janitor there. They just kinda told me the right way, and came and fixed the door. It was obvious that I wasn\u2019t the first person to do it. I went to the men\u2019s room and snapped a shot when I was going back into the theatre. \n\nFor those of you that are curious, this is in Oman.",

I haven't read all that many comics, but for some reason I distinctly remember reading the one with Thanos collecting the infinity gems and making the gauntlet to impress death. His ambition seemed pretty mundane considering the weight of what he was doing and even though he was extremely powerful, he just didn't feel like that imposing a guy.\n\nOn the other hand, the movie thanos's ambition is practically a force of nature.  His ambition was awesomely destructive in both, but this made him feel more imposing.",

No need to do that for bathroom doors, which are pretty much never emergency doors.  \n  \nThere's a book (kinda cliche to mention it here) called The Design of Everyday Things which is about the psychology of stuff like doors. I think a big section of the book is on doors actually. Basically, well designed doors should be obvious to people what kind of door they are and how they open before they approach. Emergency doors need to be able to be operated by panicking people, and a mob has a collective intelligence of a toddler. People have died from doors that are difficult to open and/or misleading during a fire or emergency, so standardized door handles are important.  \n  \nAnother fun fact about doors is that in a stairwell, there is always going to be a pull to open gate or door separating stairs that go below ground from stairs that go above the ground floor. In a mob, people will run down stairs until they get to the bottom when trying to escape, and the little gate makes people not run into a basement",

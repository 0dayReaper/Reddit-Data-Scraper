Design is a whole lot more than just what something looks like, it's also the art of where things go and how they're accessed among other things. A more accurate statement is that Apple sacrifices function and design for aesthetics. For example, the notch is a poor design choice because it eats up the space being used by the main screen and forces developers to use some silly workarounds to get things like games to work properly with the notch. It disrupts the order of where UI elements go. But it's fine because it looks pretty or something.",

But there is a budget gym, Planet Fitness, in the States that serves pizzas and donuts two different times once a week, and always had Tootsie rolls at the front desk. Honestly kinda brilliant, business wise.\n\nThey also have a \"lunk alarm\", that they ring from the front desk if you drop a weight even like five cm from the ground, or grunt, or do any of a number of things you kinda have to do when lifting big.\n\nThey called it being a \"lunk\", and they had, to describe a lunk, one of those \"clever\" little sassy statements that companies trying to be cool put out that's clearly vetted by standards and marketing.\n\nE.g. \"Lunks are those big muscle-bound dudes who can't touch their ears, drop weights, and otherwise JUDGE. As a Judgement Free Zone (TM), Planet Fitness...\" And so on.\n\nAs you can probably tell, I'm a lil bit bitter about my time there, and I now go to a YMCA which oddly is cooler about lifting hard.\n\nFuck PF",

I went through a crappy breakup and was trying to get massive so I ended up exceeding that much weight in a few months and was looking for a gym.  Found out Planet Fitness doesn\u2019t go beyond 50 lb dumbbells.  I was able to curl 70 lb dumbbells at the time, so needless to say they were crossed off the list.  One of the guys on our squad signed up because of how cheap they were and we all made fun of him.  He was probably the weakest guy on our squad so he made it even worse on himself.\n\nI ended up buying weights offline and had a huge unfinished basement which became my fitness room.  I definitely recommend seeing what you can find on craigslist and going to r/bodyweightfitness for some more ideas.  I miss lifting and doing calisthenics.  Tore several muscles in my chest and arms during a freak soccer injury and can\u2019t lift anymore.",

All that stuff is part of their strategy. In order to keep the prices low, they need a high number of members who either don't go often, or don't spend a whole lot of time at the gym. They are purposefully trying to discourage the type of people who go to the gym for daily, multi hour workouts, tying up the equipment.\n\nI'm a member, and I see that as a positive thing. I'm too casual of a gym goer to spend $100 at some elite gym. I just need a place that's good enough to stay healthy. Maybe spend a little bit of time on treadmill and the machines, so I don't pass out or get a hernia while taking the trash out to the bin.",

It's been very positive.\n\nThere is one pizza day per month, and one bagel morning per month. The snacks are laid out on a table in boxes in the lobby for anyone who wants. No one has to eat if they don't want; and I've never seen anyone pigging out. The expectation is to eat in the lobby before or after the workout. I don't snack, but it's a nice community gesture.\n\nThe Tootsies are minis. About 12 cal each. Don't eat 'em if you don't want to. I do nab one of these occasionally.\n\nI've heard the lunk alarm once in 10 months (and I couldn't track why it was set off, I think it was a mistake). Staff and patrons are pretty tolerant to occasional clangs/clatters and reasonable vocalizations/grunts. A few times I've heard noisy machines and either a staffer or a patron went over to help the person operate the machine properly. Everyone seems pretty chill and \"live and let live\". There's no pressure to add classes/get trainers for extra $$; there are free training classes available to help make the most of the gym.\n\nMy husband used to do a bit of heavy machine work, and he's pleased with the ranges available. I can't speak to the free weights but I do see a few seriously cut lifting folks working there.\n\nIt's a beginner gym, no question. The ads are just hype (like any ads). The  biz model -- sign up lots of peeps, expect that many won't attend -- is how EVERY gym works lol. The price is right for what I'm getting.",

That's not a low bodyweight, but fatter still isn't better.\n\nYou talk like big bellied is better for strongman, when Mariusz Pudzianowski is one of the greatest superheavyweight strongmen of all time, and he was pretty ripped (even in comps).  No, not bodybuilder ripped, but ripped nonetheless.  Edit: tbf strongmen do need a large enough belly to do a continental clean, but the SHW untested ones can do that without being fat.",

It was more of a reference to guys that are 6 feet tall that get down to 150 pounds to look \"ripped.\" Looking like you're in dire need of a sandwich isn't a good look, nor is it particularly strong. \n\nYou would probably agree with me that most \"bodybuilders\" wouldn't win powerlifting competitions any more than most powerlifters would win bodybuilding competitions. I'm not knocking either; to each their own, and goals are goals. It's just that \"looking strong\" doesn't always equate to being strong. Although Mr. Pudzianowski and Mr. Green have accomplished both.",

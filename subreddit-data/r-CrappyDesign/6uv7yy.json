Just go away.\n\nEvery time someone posts a picture, a gif, a video, a screenshot, or just anything really that involves some kind of \"corporate\" thing - A video game, a logo, or probably just even the town hall of a city given how overboard you dummies go, you have to [/r/HailCorporate](/r/RandomActsOfMuting)   it.\n\nI'm done. I've had enough. You can't just spam [/r/HailCorporate](/r/RandomActsOfMuting) and expect an upvote. You can't just be like \"dude, you're playing a game?\" and post [/r/HailCorporate](/r/RandomActsOfMuting). You just can't.\n\nI doubt you even work for corporate given how against them you are. You live in a cardboard box, typing on your CrapBook Pro, feeling good about yourself because you think you just \"called someone else out\" for being a corporate shrill.\n\nJust who do you think you are? Some epic 12-year-old on the internet with le cool fedora posting about how \"corporate shrill hails this, corporate shrill hails that?\" Well, I've got news for you. You aren't anything. You aren't epic, you aren't a 12-year-old, and your fedora certainly isn't le cool.\n\nI hope in time you will learn that not everybody and everything is a corporate shrill.",

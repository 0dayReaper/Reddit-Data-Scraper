And as a PreK teacher, I do think it\u2019s super important to let kids climb up slides, climb trees, play with sticks and test their bodies. This slide, however, seems designed by someone who doesn\u2019t understand movement and physics and that children lack strong core muscles. \nThat being said, it\u2019s down the street from myhouse and I take my nephews there all the time.\n\n\nEdited to add- kids learn how to engage their core muscles better the next time they go down, but even still- it\u2019s very fast and a rough ride.",

Except they designed it like this,with sharp bends and a short run off into a gravel pit. It was open for a day before they closed it and tore it down due to people getting injured. Good waste of government money (although they claim the contractors ate the cost)\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/12/steep-slide-closes-spain-day-after-opening-injuries-costa-del-sol\n\nEdit: and yes I did go down it twice, ended up with a huge graze on my elbow and several bruises. My apartment was actually in the block right next to the left of the top of the slide!",

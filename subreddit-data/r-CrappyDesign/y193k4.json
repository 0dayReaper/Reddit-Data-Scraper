Ideally, it would be designed to open the lock if it detects the electronics aren't working, but not sure how it works in practice. \n\nFurther, a driver could even get into an accident because he was trying to get something out of the glovebox. In traditional setups, you can simply reach over and grab something while keeping your eyes on the road.  With the dumb touchscreen fad for center consoles, you have to keep your eyes off the road to focus on the touchscreen instead to make sure you're pressing the right spot.  That split second where you're looking away usually doesn't matter, but if something goes wrong (e.g, a kid darting into traffic), you need to be focused on the road.\n\nSame thing can be said for other controls. Rather than a split second turn of a dial to up the AC a bit or adjust the music, you've got to navigate the menu system of a janky touchscreen. That's a lot of time spent with eyes on the touchscreen, not the road.",

The this is filled with fluid, so there are rubber gaskets everywhere, waiting to leak. There are numerous circuit board inside the motor housings, what happens when a cap goes bad on one? Whole new motor? No one, not even repair shops likely have the time, training and tools needed to fix that 10 cent part.",

First step of design is to make stuff easier, not harder, people are fucking lazy and we won't go those extra steps.\n\nAlso, just consider the time it would take to do this while driving if you had to. Same with seat heating and climate control, all of that has started to move into the menus rather than having buttons and it's fucking stupid",

And manufacturer can sometimes take up to 3months just to get out there. And farmers need it up and runing a sap. Supporting right to repair wont get rid of subscription it will only let you fix your devices without the manufacturer activating the new part.",

Companies are locking down products to only support official replacements for consumable parts, even if they are standardised.\n\nLike water filters in fridges. Your filter gets old and the fridge won't let you use it. You replace it with a properly priced 3rd party filter and the fridge refuses to turn it on. The solution is bypassing the software locking down the hardware, which is what is done with pirating software.",

The software essentially bricked the tractor until a service tech could come out and clear the codes and use a diagnostic tool that consumers are not allowed to own or use under DMCA laws.  \n\nThe tech couldn't make it out for two weeks so we used a big ass winch to pull the tractor onto a trailer to get it to the dealership to clear the code and diagnose the problem.  It was covered under warranty and the \"repair\" took about a week.  We get the damn thing back in the field and the EXACT SAME THING happened again.  \n\nEnded up getting rid of that tractor and they borrowed our old 1486 International for the season.\n\nEdit:  Something that worries the shit out of me is after Russia stole a bunch of John Deere tractors from Ukrainian farmers JD bricked the tractors with a forced software update.  On the one hand fuck Russian and I have no problem with that but on the other what happens in 10 to 15 years and John Deere has an entire new system with new software are they going to keep up with security updates for the old tractors?  Could a hacker breach the system and brick the tractors for thousands of farmers?",

That's all. Button next to the glove box which feels tactile and responsive. Give me single function touch sliders with hepatic feedback for all the climate control. A wheel button layout with dedicated buttons and a configurable button scheme including double tap and hold functions. \n\nLet everything on the touch screen be navigated from the wheel, the best way to go about this is a way where I eventually commit to memory the pattern to get the function I want without taking my eyes of the road. People could blind text under their desk with one hand on a flipphone in school, we do it all the time in video games. I think I can handle a steering wheel control scheme that let's me do a few basic functions.",

Mechanical glovebox. Slotted directional manual vents. Mechanical charging port door. Tactile and tangible volume knob.

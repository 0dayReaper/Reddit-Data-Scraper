The lock is recessed, so you can't flip it up to look at the bottom. \n\nExample: https://imgur.com/a/C8QMhTd\n\nThe combination (sorry) of the cutout in the body of the lock and that little stair-step for the top row are done so you don't have to bend over as far to see the combination you're entering.\n\nIts not a crappy design its just a design feature that is only beneficial for the specific niche the lock is intended for.",

You're not supposed to judge design elements piecemeal. As a part of the whole design, it's not really a problem because if you get from \"SHAPE THE\" and get to \"FU,\" your mind's already finishing the sentence, \"SHAPE THE FUTURE.\" \n\nAs others have said, this isn't a great piece of design, but it works fine as intended, and I reiterate my comment that so much of this sub is \"Look at this unusual type.\"",

Really?\n\nI 100% did *not* \"intentionally misread\" this, and I highly doubt \"many\", let alone \"most\" of the people commenting on the spelling didn't either. Why do you think there's so many comments on it's misspelling? Probably because it's poorly designed. Just because you unintentionally read this message correctly, doesn't automatically make everyone able to read it.\n\nAnd aside from your mind being lazy and auto-correcting the spelling of a jumbled word, are you trying to tell me that composition of an art piece isn't important when judging the design? You think spelling isn't important? You the one with the \"No Regerts\" tattoo on your back? *\"Hey, you know what it's supposed to say! It's not a problem- it works as intended!\"*",

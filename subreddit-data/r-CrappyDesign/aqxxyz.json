Following that, older people, who are wiser, are a valuable group of voters (theoretically) because they have more experience from past mistakes and should therefore vote more wisely than the younger demographics, and have more knowledge on what is good for the country.\n\nIn practice, people generally vote for what benefits them directly, instead of voting on the objectively better candidate/party/choice. Another example of why democracy doesn't work optimally in real life.\n\nAlso, the proportions between older and younger people are not in balance right now, due to the baby boom. This only inflates the problem. ",

It deals with impulse control, differentiating between thoughts, planning and decision making, and social functioning.  Before it finishes developing, you're not really capable of determining that your actions have consequences, for you or other people.  It's the reason that we should probably raise the drinking age.  \n\nSo yeah, it's probably mostly your brain.  Probably a little your experiences, but mostly your brain.",

I had made a file will the text and image of a guys face in Adobe Illustrator, and sent it to the people that cast the plaque as an .ai file, as requested. There were some quotes and an apostrophe in the word \"it's\" in the file I sent. They sent back a PDF with the final proof, which looked identical, except for some reason the quotes and apostrophe did not show up. I told them it looked good (because I didn't notice the 5 missing hash marks) and they cast the $2000 plaque without the marks. I saw this and was pissed. Went back to look at the proof and sure enough, they just weren't there. It was one of those PDFs where you can highlight the text and what was weird was that the marks were there if you copied and pasted the text, but they just weren't visible in the PDF. Anyway, I refused to pay them for a while until the recast it or just added an apostrophe somehow because they really should have made sure it was free of grammatical errors, but they threatened to take me to court and I was just some dumb college kid who couldn't afford court or a new plaque. So now there's an immortalized plaque on a building at my alma mater that says \"its\" instead of \"it's.\"",

Then it probably looked odd but they liked the World War text and if they used 11 it didnt have the serifs and it looked good. Then they send it to the plaque people. The font is one they dont have, and it auto substitutes for a different one. They dont proof back the art and their prepress doesnt pay attention to how it changed. The tech working the company may or may not noticed, but if the job is approved they run it and file it away as \"not my job.\" The plaque gets delivered. Its given a cursorary glance and then installed in a hurry because everything is behind schedule and they need to get this installed ASAP. Then it sits, as visitors snicker and mockingly recall fake memories on social media websites.",

I've seen people in the past rag on businesses for using stock images and the way this person said, \"It's just pasted stock images,\" felt kind of dismissive of using stock images.\n\nI don't know. I probably read it wrong. I do that a lot. But with the flood of memes based around bad stock images, stock images and the use of them got a bad rap for a while. And I was part of that, sadly enough. So I guess I overcompensate to try to feel less bad about the mistakes of my past.",

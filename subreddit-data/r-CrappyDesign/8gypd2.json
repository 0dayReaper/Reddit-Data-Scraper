I have to add that i did not have to take a test twice so i got lucky and got through that pretty quick. \nWhat i have heard is that you have to pay between 200 and 300 \u20ac to retake the driving test if you fail it. This adds up with every additional fail after this obviously. \nTo make it short it is possible to get away quite \"cheap\"(which is still a lot more than in america as i read in some comments) see me, but it is not rare for people to pay over 2000\u20ac for their drivers license.",

In British Columbia (Canada) we get a \"L\" or learners permit, which allows us to drive a vehicle as long as theres a 25+, fully licenced passenger. After a year you can get your \"N\", or new driver permit. Which allows you to drive on your own, but does not allow more than 1 non-family passenger. After 2 years with it you can go and get your full licence, after that theres more specific ones, for busses, transport trucks, bikes, etc. From L - Full it costs about $250-500 depending how many times your fail the tests. From what I've heard about German tests it seems much more comprehensive and ends with much better drivers. I'd honestly prefer people had to pay $2000 to get a licence, we wouldnt have nearly as many accidents, and people might actually know the fucking rules.",

It's not as important to own a car in Germany since you can take public transportation everywhere. That's not the case here. Requiring over $500 just to get a license would lead to literal poverty here since people wouldn't have the means to get to a grocery store and back in a reasonable amount of time let along adding work and other errands to the mix. Our country is run on cars and bit having one is almost a deliberate hobble. I agree that cars are bad for the environment but I just don't think the West is equipped to handle a world without them lol. ",

There is some chance the solicitor will opt not to proceed, but they usually will proceed and there\u2019s next to no chance the judge will dismiss the charges. \n\nEdit: Police officers more or less must be present at trial in California due to a state Supreme Court ruling. The police officer is free to notify the court he will not be present in which case the court will reschedule. The police officer may also send a department representative. So even in California there is no guarantee that the case will be dismissed. If you do not live in California then chances are the officer\u2019s presence isn\u2019t mandatory for trial to commence as most states treat a police officer\u2019s report as evidence. Just like a traffic camera. You have to present credible evidence that there is missing information. If the judge accepts that there is missing information and the officer is the only person able to answer questions which might reveal such information, only then must an officer be present. You are not likely to convince a Judge that only the officer can answer a given a question. ",

I\u2019m actually more inclined to believe the more serious charge being dismissed because a more serious crime may be more complicated and issues might arise that need clarification. No cop means no counter witness. On the less serious charge you just got a judge in a good mood.

It was a minor traffic offense, and when he pulled me over, he even said it was obvious that I didn't see it, because I didn't even touch the brakes. Here in the US though, it's extremely likely that the judge will dismiss the charges, because they understand the fact that the cop didn't think it was serious enough to be worth his/her time.

One particular state whose law I am more familiar with provides that if you cut down a tree that isn't yours, you are liable for three times the value of that tree (which can be around $4,000 before tripling, I don't even know how high that number can get). It isn't exactly the *easiest* thing to deal with in court, but you don't want to be stuck with that bill, even if you can't see a stop sign.

Sign by itself is often insufficient. In the photo above, I don't see a proper stop bar. \n2. On private property (like a parking lot), a stop sign *might* be unenforceable. It may depend on whether it was installed by the department of transportation, or the property owner. In some cases this will be extremely obvious, because the stop sign won't even conform to DOT standards (different size, non reflective, etc). However just because it's a standard sign doesn't mean it was installed by the DOT - you need to check the back for a sticker showing that it's an official sign. \n3. Some places have rules where a stop sign isn't enforceable if it's blocked from view. If you're in a crash or get a ticket, make sure you get photos, as offending trees have a way of being trimmed right after your issue, removing any evidence.\n\nAgain, laws vary by state.\n\nI tried posting a comment with photos showing examples, but it was blocked by the SPAM filter. So, Google them yourself if you're unsure. ",

Fuck courts, and the us law system.",

However, the Alderman was concerened that the lights would flash too much at night and disturb people who live near it so they did nothing. \n\nits frustrating because not many people complain about that stop sign. the people who go through it and live have a voice and those who die dont. yet all those people in the apartments near by also have voices and they didnt want the lights. it makes sense as an alderman to do more for the most people in your ward, especially the living people, but its frustrating that preventing some lights from blinking in peoples apartments comes at the cost of some peoples deaths",

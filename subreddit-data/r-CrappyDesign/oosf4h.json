But since they usually release a version of each for every successive generation, you can end up with old tech when getting an i7, and there are i5s that can outperform older i7s in most use cases. If you're buying a CPU at a brick-and-mortar store though, they likely will only be selling the current and previous generation of hardware and you can pretty much go off of the 'i' for what's best.",

It's impossible for a casual buyer to know what they should be looking for because they don't actually put the useful information on the display card.\n\nUsually \"6th gen i5\" is enough to give you an idea of actual power, but if they just showed the model name \"6500u\" it would tell you literally everything, and they hide it to try and scam you.",

When I find someone I know knows their shit, I like to let them try and upsell me.  I always do my research ahead of time so I know generally what I want and if they're selling me on something stupid.  But sometimes its fun to let them talk me into going for the stuff that I'm on the fence about.  \n\nAnd sometimes I can be talked into stupid shit.  \n\nLike RGB memory.\n\nYes I bought the RGB memory.

Im about 15 years behind the curve but just shopping online for a machine means having several tabs up per item because youll find something approximate on, say, best buy, and the *product specifications* just say \u201ci7\u201d\u2026. Ok, well there\u2019s like 20+, so which one? Near as i can tell they dont get *that* specific, so you have to find a product page through the manufacturer or a third party and there isnt *always* one, and even still depending on the vendor you cant return it because a \u201cthird party\u201d specified something other than what you got.\n\nI like handhelds but man, the change from pc to laptop to tablets and phones has really *really* fucked the consumer out of any chance of understanding, and of course being able to modify their product.",

It's exactly what you say about laptops. Do you want the 27GL83A-B? All of the reviews say that's the best one. Except no retailers carry it, they only carry the 27GL650F-B. Are those two the same? Well actually the 27GL650F-B is just a refreshed version of the 27GN850-B with a slightly better refresh rate, but a worse color gamut. However they made a totally different monitor following the same model number line which is the 27GN950-B, which is much cheaper but is made in a different factory and some people report poor quality. \n\nAll of these are LG-brand monitors (not the correct descriptions though), and you can spend days trying to get them all straight. And then you realize there's another dozen manufacturers with totally different numbering systems. How do these all compare to an XG27AQ? (trick question, it depends if the XG was made in the Taiwan factory or the Singapore factory)",

No matter what happens OEI like dell, HP, lenovo, and acer are always a bad choice.  A prebuilder like ABS (newegg) or cybper power that use normal but typically low quality parts could be OK. Your best option is some place like monoprice or central computer to build it for you.  Companies that try to do a middle like build redux and NZXT are ok, and newegg is starting an assembly service now as well.\n\n|\n\nFor parts availability it seems like OEI are not having more availability than reputable options.\n\n|\n\nEdit, for an example.  If you look at an OEI dell 5800 vs a properly set up 5800x with a $20-30 cooler you are looking at 4.5-4.7ghz depending on load for the 5800x but the dell one is going to have a hard time keeping 4ghz.  So even without doing any overclocking or even running clock tuner on auto you are losing so much.  The difference in GPU clocks is even more most of the time. (The 5800x and 5800 are the same.  The 5800 comes with a lower wattage that is auto set, but can do full wattage like the X if configured that way.  The OEM for the MB sets the default limit and OEI can set the higher wattage as default if it is a board for them and not the public)",

(Can you believe they are still putting spinner hard drives in these?) Was poking around at the computer and noticed the cover moved over to reveal\u2026 a disc drive. Who uses those anymore\u2026 right? Had a good laugh when I realized you can\u2019t open the stupid fancy cover when anything is plugged into the USB ports. Yes, if this were mine, that cover would find its new home in the middle of the parking lot :)\n\nI showed this post to my customer and we both got a good laugh out of it! Apparently he actually does use the drive for watching DVD\u2019s (he\u2019s an older fellow, super nice) and commented that he also thought it was a terrible design, lol. We moved the USB receiver to the back of the machine instead. So people DO still use this ancient, antiquated, medieval, obsolete technology!\n\nAlso, yes I know the video has a watermark\u2026 I made a version for YouTube Shorts and accidentally posted the same one here. Noticed this after I posted, I think it\u2019s too late to change it now :( I don\u2019t care if you save my video or use it in a YouTube video, please - feel free to use it. Message me and I\u2019ll send you an non- watermarked version if you need it.\n\nI have so much more crap like this I run into at work that I could post here and on other subreddits\u2026 and I think I will! Thanks again everyone!\n\nEdit: Thanks for the silver!! So kind of y\u2019all!",

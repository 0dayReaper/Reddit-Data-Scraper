In this case, they found this industrial designer's portfolio page full of arty, pushing the boundary things, which is pretty common (similar with those in design, fashion, and architecture where their portfolios will be more imaginative while there is more pressure to be more conservative when working for a company), and presented it as if some major office furniture company made this and this is their ad or demo video. \n\nAlso your point applies to the platforms as well, including Reddit. They have an incentive for allowing and encouraging content that increases engagement even if it is misleading or outright false, divisive, anger inducing, etc.",

The cushioning needs to be wider and softer, flip up arm rests looks like they would be needed too. Also what does this chair do that a traditional recliner and laptop table can't? It doesn't look comfortable even to type on sitting or reclining, and most people aren't trying to do serious work balancing a laptop on their knees.",

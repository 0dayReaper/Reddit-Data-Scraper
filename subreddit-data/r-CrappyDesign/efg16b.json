This could have been done to extend the shelf life of the bananas.\n\nConversely, placing bananas into a paper bag will speed up the ripening process because paper allows the oxygen in while also trapping ethelyne in. Bananas produce higher amounts of ethelyne during the ripening process than other fruits do. So placing other fruit into the bag with the bananas will help them ripen more quickly.",

They may be trying to prevent this.\n\nAlso, the total carbon footprint of the packaging is much less than the carbon footprint of the food going to waste. Any opportunity to extend the shelf life (assuming it results In Being eaten instead of being thrown away) is technically better for the environment.  A similar yet more extreme example of this would be a fully processed ham in shrink wrap. The carbon footprint of the ham is up to 700 times more impactful than the plastic wrap itself, so you really need the ham to last as long as possible.\n\nThis is of course in theory. I\u2019d rather just have the peel do it\u2019s job and hope for people to waste less food/grocery stores improve algorithms to minimize waste.",

Also, as that peel is breaking down, it releases nutrients into the soil around it encouraging the growth of other life.  Plastic on the other hand will literally release poison into the surrounding soil as it decomposes.\n\nSo I mentioned that the 2 year thing isn't true.  The only conditions that could be true, is if the banana peel was left in some type of sanitized condition (ie, on a shelf, buried in hot sand, etc).  Burying it in soil, it will absolutely decompose a lot faster then that.  Ask anybody who put them in compost.",

The same is true of leaves - if you go digging in the top layers, you basically find a mulch of leaves and other organic matter that's more and more decomposed, but some bits can still be identified. That's okay, there's nothing wrong with it. \n\nIf you took a scoop of it and gave it a good shake, most of it would fall apart. There's not much left there. But, depending on your definition, the banana peel would still be \"there\" for a long time. \n\nThe same is true of many things. There's the issue of poop at campsites - when buried, it doesn't always decompose the way we think it should, and so it can still be there, looking and smelling pretty much the same, 2 years later. But that doesn't mean that plants and bugs can't use it the way they'd use soil otherwise.",

So, when it is enclosed in a bag of some sorts, the gas gets trapped, the concentration gets really high and the banana ripens fast. BUT to produce this gas, the banana needs oxygen. So, if the bag is absolutely airtight, it's not going to ripe quickly at all. If this is the case, it's actually a decent design.",

Sometimes they'll come in wrapped differently to trap as much of the gas as possible, but there still needs to be some ventilation (and when they arrive you still need to pull the top off and pull the plastic back of every single case), because then you might end up with green bananas with brown spots. Either way, the produce department controls the ripeness of the bananas. You can go from mostly green bananas to what you see in OP's photo in 2 days by simply not arranging the cases on the pallet correctly. \n\nSo wrapping them individually in plastic is idiotic.",

Each melon is grown on its own plant (1 melon per plant) and is hand rubbed daily or something ridiculous, then it is harvested and wrapped in paper, put into a hand carved wooden box and sold for hundreds of dollars (USD equivalent), if not thousands of dollars.\n\nThe whole point of this is to show that the melon had received uncompromised care and attention every step of the way, and its presentation as a gift reflects the gift-giver's intentions. Absolutely insane that a $5 melon can go for 100x in Japan, if it was well-cared for and has a perfect shape and texture.",

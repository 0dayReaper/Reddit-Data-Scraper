It's a case so open and shut that I doubt it would even make it onto the desk of a materials engineer, because expert testimony probably wouldn't even be required.",

Pulling codebooks, organizing files, reading depositions, stuff like that. It was a temporary job from the start but it was pretty interesting for the ~6 months I was there.\n\nTo actually be a forensic engineer (at this firm at least), you needed to have like 35+ years of engineering experience with some kind of specialty. Most of them had 40 years of experience, it was more of a post-engineering job for these guys than a full career path. You have to have a lot of confidence in what you're talking about if you're willing to go on the stand for it and potentially be countered by another forensic engineer.\n\nI think they made a TON of money and they worked extremely friendly hours most of the time. It definitely was more law than engineering though, I got into engineering because I like math so it wasn't something I'd want to do full-time. Lots of reading building codes, interpreting legalese, writing reports, etc. Not nearly as thrilling as the title of \"forensic engineer\" would lead you to believe. A lot of their work was boring \"I slipped at Target and now I'm suing them\" cases. Sometimes you're with the prosecution, sometimes you're with the defense.\n\nI think there are people who have full forensic engineering careers starting fresh out of college, but I don't have any experience with that full career path. I imagine it would be similar to my temp job where you're doing the dirty work for the higher-up engineers. Visiting sites and taking pictures, reading building codes, reading depositions to highlight just the most important parts, that kind of thing.",

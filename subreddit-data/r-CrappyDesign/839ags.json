If you're using RES (and you should) or NowForReddit (Android app), it's no advantage.  The hallowed gold lounge is full of people going \"is this it?\" and \"what now?\".  And Cond\u00e9 Nast (one of the biggest publishing companies the world) get even more money than they get by selling adverts and \"recommend\" stories as well as boosting viral campaigns.\n\nInstead, wish that someone gives \u00a33 to RSPCA  and it'll do everyone a lot more good!",

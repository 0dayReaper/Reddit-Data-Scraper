[\"The Loop Variant\"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Trolley_problem.svg/512px-Trolley_problem.svg.png) of the trolley problem has exactly this layout, the only difference being the diversion track is supposed to have a fat person that slows down the train.\n\n&gt; As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people and you can divert it onto a secondary track. However, in this variant the secondary track later rejoins the main track, so diverting the trolley still leaves it on a track which leads to the five people. But, the person on the secondary track is a fat person who, when he is killed by the trolley, will stop it from continuing on to the five people. Should you flip the switch?",

I wasnt wrong, i just thought option B was more justified and he didnt.  Failed everybody who went with B. I dropped his class immediately\n\nEdit: it wasn't multiple choice. The reader was presented a situation like the one above and had to describe why they chose either option. Basically a participation question. Completely up to our intepretation but for some reason either his TA or him didn't grade it as such\n\nEdit2: i didn't descibe details because it was years ago but the question was about some dude in a cloning chamber (similar to what happens in the presitge) and was about how the dude died. I cant give much more detail than that because i honestly dont remember\n\nEdit 3: people who immediately dismiss stuff that has no bearing on their lives and doesn't affect anybody in any way but still think they are the authority on whats real or not crack me up. I was pissed i left all that money on the table but my time and effort was better spent on my engineering classes so id happily toss that money away again",

If you pay attention to the skulls it's clearer but maybe you need to be more familiar with it to understand, I don't know.\n\nThere is a variant where you divert the train and it kills the single person and by crashing into him stops (presumably this one guy is extremely fat or something). It is distinct from the usual version of the problem as the 5 workers are still on the same track. So the difference is (supposedly) as follows: in the original version you are choosing to kill 5 or kill 1, in this variant you are choosing to kill 1 in order to save 5.",

In the image on the right, 5 people die, but you didn't directly cause anyone's death.  Which is better from a moral position?

Does that make a difference to whether it's permissible to kill him? If so, why?",

However, in this variant the secondary track later rejoins the main track, so diverting the trolley still leaves it on a track which leads to the five people. But, the person on the secondary track is a fat person who, when he is killed by the trolley, will stop it from continuing on to the five people. Should you flip the switch?",

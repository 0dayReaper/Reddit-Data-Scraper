That point (in this case) is at the end of the tracks.\n\nThere are several points in your average perspective that makes the image warp more and more. Humans, for example, have two eyes so we see everything in two point perspective at minimum.\n\nTwo point perspective, note how you see two faces of this building the lines moving towards the horizon on two different spots: \nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jewish_Museum_building_line_drawing_-_b%26w_-_600_ppi.jpg\n\n\n3 point gets weird because it starts offering a third vanishing point, often off the horizon. Things look real still, but distorted.\nhttps://www.mrpayne.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1829_99_460-three-point-perspective-drawing.jpg?ssl=1\n\n4 points ect, is how you get fish eye lense.\n\nHopefully all the links work\n\nEdit: for extra mindfuck, here's someone discussing up to 6 points https://termespheres.com/6-point-perspective/",

In NYC, I had a friend who lived in a studio apartment where the bathroom was private, but could only be accessed by exiting the apartment and entering a locked door 8 feet down the hall.  Another friend had an apartment where one closet held a toilet, and the other closet held a cheap plastic stall shower crammed into the space.  No overhead light of any kind.  But there was a drain in the middle of the kitchen floor for some reason.",

Each individual one might believe (rightly) to be producing good work, but the end result can still come out bad.\n\nAnyway, just a theory. But it might also explain why the bathroom is carpeted, which is rather unusual in most countries (the UK is the only one I know where people have carpets in their bathrooms). But maybe it's just fake.",

It is also usually the cheapest carpet money can buy. This is because no matter what that carpet will need to be replaced when you move out so the landlord is guaranteed to keep your deposit. The landlords usually just buy a giant roll of cheap carpet on sale and then replace it themselves for cheap so they make a profit off the gross bathroom carpet. It's a shady thing to do and I refuse to rent anywhere that has carpet in either of those rooms because it is also a red flag that the landlord will be shitty in other ways. ",

Then they needed a bathroom and used that background, probably to save time/money.\n\nFelt like the toilet and tub needed to be in the shot to make it look like a bathroom, but didn't have the above mentioned time/money to plan it better (or perhaps they had previously shown the tub in relation with the sink, so it *had* to be there, and only realized it didn't fit too late after they had decided to use that background).",

They had the handyman install the countertops between renters, and sometimes he put them in upside down.

This is quite common in older apartments where large victorian homes with multi levels and many, many rooms are divided up and sectioned into apartments to rent out. Sometimes you get odd door placements. For example, as I write this, I'm sitting next to my bookshelf, which is quite clearly a door entryway lined with shelves (complete with doorknob). The door was sealed off to make my apartment, but on the other side of my \"shelf\" is a very plain looking door at the end of a hallway that doesn't open for some reason...\n\nOr it could be lazy artistry, who knows?",

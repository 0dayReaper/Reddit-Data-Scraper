Where was that enthusiasm the past 20 years when he was laying in bed getting sponge baths and spilling cabbage water on his nightgown like Mrs. Bucket ain't done enough fucking laundry already? Mother fucker would rather lay in bed and starve than take his old ass to work, but as as soon there's chance to ride his grandson's coattails to a whimsical chocolate factory with an enslaved workforce guess who's tap dancing up the goddamn walls? Fuck grandpa joe. I'm gonna go punch a hole in the drywall now.",

Writing isn't about letters just like math isn't about numbers. \n\nMy continuum mechanics professor couldn't do any math from before about calc 2 without screwing it up because it's been like 20 years since he did that kind of math.

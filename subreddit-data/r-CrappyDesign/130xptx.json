Take a closer look at the decal and growth of each price and investment. While hold maintains an investible price, copper is on the rise due to the incredible increase in the production of mechanics and various personal technologies. The use of gold is still a largely used part in these, it's becoming more and more common to substitute it with better, cheaper materials\n\nThe price of gold and usability is also incredibly diverse regarding location in both the US and around the world. I'm specifically talking about the production and use of gold in the US and it's decrease in price, mostly per gram. Gold has very little usage in common place items as well, while copper does.\n\nGold will not last long.",

Given the density of osmium packing 22,5g/cm\u00b3 that results in a fully dense osmium bat weighing roughly between 27,7kg and 33,25kg.\n\nGonna do some handwaving since I don't feel like calculating the inertia from a swung bat, but seeing as it's somewhere between a third and half the weight of an average person, I'd say inertia will likely pull everyone but the strongest off their feet before they can get a decent swing in.",

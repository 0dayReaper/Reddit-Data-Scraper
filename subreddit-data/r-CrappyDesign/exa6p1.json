In many classic italian dishes, the sauce is a fat and pasta water emulsified in the pan until it coats the noodles.\n\nThicker isn't really the right word but it helps create a sauce that coats noodles.",

A post showing photos of a colander being placed over a boiling pot of pasta, which is then all inverted over the sink to drain the cooking water has been making the rounds on Twitter and Facebook. And people have been losing their minds, thinking that everything they\u2019ve ever known is a lie.\n\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s actually a ton wrong with this,\u201d said James Briscione, director of culinary research for the Institute of Culinary Education in New York City. \u201cLet\u2019s start from a safety perspective. There\u2019s a high risk of burning yourself, either on the pot or with the water when you pour it out. If you aren\u2019t holding it securely, you have a good chance of pouring pasta into your sink, which is not hygienic. Depending how hot your pot is, there\u2019s also a good possibility of melting the colander and ruining your pot.\u201d",

You need to bend the edge to remove the sharp edge. You cannot bend it outwards because that requires bigger diameter than the biggest diameter of the colander. If you deal with the sharp edge by grinding it, you've just introduced another process which makes it more expensive. \n\nIf you pay a ridiculously low price, don't expect things to work perfectly like an entitled jerk.

Like pretty much every other utensil in your kitchen might trap a bit of food from time to time.\n\nThis is pasta. Pasta is a bit sticky when drained. When you drain pasta you usually even get a few pieces sticking to the pan. In which case you just nudge it with a spoon or give it a shake. \n\nI made a stew yesterday and when I poured it into bowls one or two pieces of meat and vegetables remained in the pan. You know what I did rather than taking a picture of it and posting it to reddit? I just scraped the last bits out with a fucking spoon.\n\nThe fuck is wrong with this sub?",

            "comment": "Italian here.\n\nYou are cooking that pasta to much.\n\nIf it's al dente, it's tough and don't get trapped on that ring.\n\nIf it's scotta (overcooked) it gets sticky and is easily trapped.\n\nCut down your cooking time, I'd say by at least 5 minutes.\n\nWhen you bite the pasta, you should see a super tiny inner ring, just inside of it, right in the middle. It feels hard on your teeth, but not in an unpleasant way.",

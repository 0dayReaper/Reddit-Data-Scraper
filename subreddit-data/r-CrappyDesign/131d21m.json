Having to ask myself whether the fire at some venue was caused by you being sloppy in quality control is not an experience you're going to love. I had to ask myself this question twice. Not because someone voiced any suspicion, just because that becomes a second nature. You. Don't. Skimp. On. Safety. Otherwise people will die, period.\nNow, sales did force me to ship some shit during the years. It never was a dangerous sort of shit. Got some enemies in sales until they noticed that less shitty products are returned less often, which does wonders for year-end bonuses. Go figure, eh? MBAs were the last to see it, as usual.",

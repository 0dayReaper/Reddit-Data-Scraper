I was capable of high Earth orbit as an infant, intergalactic travel as a toddler.  I loved docking in Uranus.  Super cozy.\n\nAnd then, like most hot air balloons, I grew up to be a cashier at Arbuckles.  But sometimes I still think back on those wonderful days I had as a kid, flying to Andromedia or the Sunflower Galaxy.\n\nSo, no, false memories are *not* a thing, especially when it comes to hot air balloons.",

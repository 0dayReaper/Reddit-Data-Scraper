This situation will necessarily result in less butter sold per-buyer at a greater cost per-hod, beneficial to the wise business-man, of course -- and I do not fault him for taking advantage of the unwary buyer whose duty it is to barter for the best butter-to-cost ratio a butter mason can achieve -- but inherently detrimental to the buyer!",

            "comment": "Former housewares designer here. It\u2019s difficult to get ink to stick to polypropylene plastic. You need to use the exact ink that can withstand oils and make sure it is heat cured at the right temp and time. I ran into this issue and even though we caught it before production, a few that were produced had this issue. It\u2019s probably safe but I wouldn\u2019t use it, and would probably return it. ",

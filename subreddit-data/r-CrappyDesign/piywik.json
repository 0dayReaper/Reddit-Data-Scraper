It didn't get astronomically more expensive to teach compared to 30 years ago, but all the government loans for college tuition meant they *could* charge more money, so they did, and now colleges are all incredibly rich.\n\nBut when most of them are non-profit institutions and your administrators are already making huge salaries, what do you do with the rest of the money? You spend it on big prestige architectural projects and amenities, so you can attract more students and collect more student loan money.\n\nIf student loans ever get forgiven, it's these colleges who will come out the big winners. They collected billions of dollars over a few decades straight from the taxpayer so they could build weird architecture and still have overfilled classes and teachers you can't understand, and they aren't accountable for a dime of it.",

                            "comment": "Yeah, roads create real physical barriers than can't easily be crossed. There's loads of cities that have basically segregated ghettos because there's a big ass road in the middle dividing the different boroughs, a road that no pedestrian can cross because there's no bridge over it or tunnel underneath\n  \nThat's what the original Candyman film was all about. How there was this ghetto in Chicago that was incredibly difficult to get in and out of, both literally in terms of travelling to other parts of the city, and figuratively in terms of poverty being almost impossible to escape once you're in it\n  \nCandyman had a scary ghost monster man thing sure, but that's not what the movie was about. It was about this specific building in Chicago that housed tons of poor families who couldn't escape it, and the crime rate was so high that the people there had to invent the Candyman myth to sort of explain it, to explain all the people who turned up dead.\n  \nIt's fascinating once you know the context of why that film was made. I'm certain the new Candyman will be great also, and also focus on poverty and ghettos in Chicago, because Jordan Peele is producing it, so I'm sure it won't just be a silly horror film with a scary ghost, but actually expand on the themes of the original\n  \nAlso the original had the very obvious trope of the white savior coming in to study the horror of the people who live there as if they're in a zoo to be studied, but they flip the trope on its head and the white savior ends up... Well just watch the film\n  \n[Here's a fantastic video explaining the original Candyman with all this context ](https://youtu.be/W-lbCzS_9fc)\n \nIt makes it one of the most intelligent and thoughtful horror films ever made. Few go into this sort of depth about the true horror, reality.\n \nEdit - also Tony Todd (who plays the candyman) is just one of the best actors ever. He was amazing every time he turned up in Star Trek because of his completely unique voice. Watch the Star Trek Deep Space 9 episode The Visitor and bring some tissues cos you're gonna cry, especially if you really love your dad. Tony Todd stars in that episode and it's just incredible every time, it always makes me bawl, and then immediately go call my dad",

The left side of his brain, the side that includes Broca's area (which controls speech) and cerebellum (motor function) is a murderous psychopath and has effective control of his body. His right hemisphere, which is not psychopathic, still has some leverage however, as it can, for example, cause his left arm and leg to refuse to cooperate with his right side, so there is an uneasy truce between the two halves. In an effort to surreptitiously warn the dentist's patients and the public at large of the other hemisphere's psychopathy, the right hemisphere began cultivating an interest in painting. It inserts subtle clues into it's paintings, such as this one, in hopes they will be recognized by the someone while being overlooked by the left hemisphere.\n\nAt least I'm pretty sure that's what's going on",

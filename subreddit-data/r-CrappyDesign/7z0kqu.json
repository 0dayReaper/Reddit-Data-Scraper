Hmmm next time one of my glaziers are looking at one I will get them to send me a picture of the electronic boxes in them and the specific instructions about only calling the manufacture or a specifically licensed person (not a joke thing either we work on automatics for swinging doors and the company we get parts from have told us the same thing) for any work on them. I will see if I can find some literature for you.\n\nAlso I should adjust my words a little, perhaps licensed is not the right word. More like a  proprietary system then a license.",

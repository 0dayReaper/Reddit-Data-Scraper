            "comment": "Because Apple has designed a specific type\nof capacitive touch-tracking technology to use in all of their products, which works best when your fingers can glide across it with as little friction as possible, to perform multi-touch gestures while still accurately tracking finger positions. \n\nThis includes the Magic Trackpad, MacBook, iPhone, and iPad. They all have glass trackpads.\n\nSimilar devices made with plastic or other materials develop friction over time, with wear, vs. glass.\n\nAlthough a few materials exist which might work well on the remote, their design also requires translucency for devices with screens, making \u201cglass\u201d the most logical choice overall.\n\nApple decided to add a touch remote in an effort to make it easier to port touchscreen apps to tvOS.  It makes some sense to use the same technology as every other device you manufacture, so that they work and feel the same.\n\nBut I hate that remote to no end, even though I understand the choices which made it a reality. \n\nSource: former researcher at a major video streaming company.",

It's literally their rule for design. If function causes a loss to form, they *get rid of that function*, no matter what.",

The tactile responsiveness of the swipe and click are really nice, and having so few buttons means I\u2019m never looking at it, that I never need to.\n\nYou know whats an awful remote? That garbage LG Wand remote. Ugh. I think my girlfriends cat is the only one that likes that shit, and only because the cat loves to chase the shaky cursor across the tv and bat at it.",

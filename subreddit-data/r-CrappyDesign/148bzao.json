I'm Robert Evens and this is Behind the Bastards, the podcast where we talk about the worst people in history and have just the worst fucking intros. Today we are talking about homes and the reason why so many people don't have them. That's right we are talking about that bastard CrazybyRX, who has the solution to the unhoused crisis and refuses to do anything about it. But first we need to take a moment to talk about the wonderful products and services that support this Podcast. Do you have a pesky school bus full of innocent civilian children and need it to go away with a single button? Well then Raytheon's got you covered with their new RX10 knife-missile. They harnessed the power of knives and put rockets on them for the most altruistic of reasons ever.",

Around 25% of homeless are families (couple + one or more kids). So that's 150k.\n\nThe average cost of an apartment complex is $400 per sq foot. Going by the numbers above, you'd need roughly 50.000 apartments with at least 1 separate bedroom (going by 2 adults and 1 kid as a family) and you the other 450k homeless people could be housed in simple studio apartments.\n\nAverage size of a 1 bedroom apartment is 750sq ft. Average size of a studio is 500 sq ft. That totals 262.5 million sq ft at a cost of $105b.\n\nSince Bezos net worth is $150b he could put enough money towarda the problem to solve it. Zuck is at $95b, so he comes up short. \n\nOther people with enough money to their name include Musk, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.\n\nImportant notes: yes, I realize net worth isn't real money. It is, however, a measure of what they could achieve.\nI also realize that these apartments aren't the ideal solutions, but they're better than the streets and give people a solid footing for a while. Which is more important than an amazing home.",

Mental and physical well-being is drastically improved when you have basic shelter.

All things that are intrinsically linked to good physical and*mental* well being.\n\nTrying to solve the mental health problems when they're still living on the streets is a losing battle.

And it wouldn't \"solve\" homelessness in and of itself; There'd always be those who don't or can't move into the apartments, as well as the inherent problems of maintaining those 1.3 million apartments, which would probably keep Elon's wealth down enough that he wouldn't be able to continue climbing the Forbe's List and only be able to maintain enough money leave 1,660 ancestors spending ~$50,000,000. Since he has 6 kids, that means each of those kids can only have 6 kids who can only have 6 kids who can only have 6 kids...so assuming each of them is that fecund, they continue to pay into maintaining those apartments, and they don't earn any additional income, they'd only be able to have $50,000,000 each for around 200 years!",

Nope, there won't be a lawn. Probably not even a balcony, and oh my god you share walls with neighbors (!) but this way you can give affordable housing to a lot of people. And most Europeans don't even see living in apartments as bad. That's the issue though, building like this is illegal in america. Q huge block with 50 apartments and hardly any parking? For it to work it needs to be close to a supermaket and school..\n\nAnd these blocks are still standing strong and people live in them with no problems.",

I mean it\u2019s really more of a server running MacOS, and although yes-it is still much more expensive than if you built it yourself. It\u2019s relatively competitive compared to the windows side of things with dell and HP. For example, your PC probably has 16 gigabytes of RAM and does just fine. A kitted our Mac has 1,500 gigabytes of ram. At say ~$100 for 16 Gb of ram you\u2019re spending about 10 grand on just the ram. Then throw in the multi thousand dollar cpu and equally expensive gpus and you\u2019ve got a several tens of thousands of dollars in parts right there. \n\nIs there an apple tax? Yes.

Businesses that line their walls with the cheapest Dells they can find, it's hyperinflated tech companies and graphic designers. Their image matters almost as much their service.\n\nWe're talking about the kind of company that installs on-tap beer kegs in the office on a whim, not the one giving you half-ply tp rolls. When people walk into their offices, they want them to see the status symbol that is Apple, and their stupid stands, and their stupid wheels, and they will pay any exorbitant amount of Venture Captial money to get it. Image is everything when you're trying woo mutli billion dollar finance firms and retailers into buying your shitty service that they'll inevitably change after 2 years anyway.\n\nI see so much waste in high end business, so much \"just throw money at it\" budget policies, but I can't get mad at Apple for taking full advantage of the market bearing price.\n\nTl;dr: don't hate the player, hate the game.",

It\u2019s so they save time and don\u2019t have to dick around trying to figure out which third-party wheels will work on a Mac Pro Tower (which had limited options as it was just released a few months ago).\n\nStill, as much as I love Apple, I agree that this is really crappy design. If you\u2019re going to overcharge that much for a set of four castors, they\u2019d better be the best fucking castors ever to grace the bottom of a computer tower. Not only are those hideous and don\u2019t even match the tower design, the fact that they don\u2019t lock is ridiculous. 100% agree that Apple failed here.",

You could even add in a checksum digit and likely have plenty of combinations left.\n\nBut really, I highly doubt that they have more than 1,000 of these signs. They could just go with a 5 digit number, with no letters, devote two bits to checksum, and still have enough combinations. And if they did need more, a 6 digit number would still be easier to type than a 4 digit alphanumeric string, so that would be the much better way to go.",

They charged a per-closed-ticket rate of like 100 bucks.\n\nEvery time someone needed a password reset because they got locked they got paid. So you bet your ass the passwords had to change like every 30 days and the requirements were increasingly obtuse.\n\nMy favorite was when you couldn't have a letter or number in the same space you had another character of the same type on the previous password.\n\nThe end result was everybody talking about how annoying it was, and we came up with a solution of \"1a1a1a1a\", then \"b2b2b2b2\", then \"3c3c3c3c\" and so on so we never got stuck for 10 minutes trying to come up with a password we could remember. \n\nThe end result of increasingly strict password requirements is that everyone ends up using the same one.",

It\u2019s also cheaper and they take really good care of their employees. I know right now employees are getting a free turkey and 25% off H\u2011E\u2011B, Hill county fare, central market and mi Tienda products through the week. Not to mention recently they gave every single employee a 350 dollar bonus on top of the two dollar raise from earlier this year. The offer company holidays/partner holiday to all employees too which is neat. It comes out to like a week and a half vacation time to all partners regardless if they are full-time or not. It\u2019s just a really good company to work for.",

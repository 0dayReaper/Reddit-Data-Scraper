Mixing ammonia and bleach produces toxic chloramine vapors. Probably not enough to kill you just from the amounts that might have soaked into the floor, but not particularly healthy either, so I would avoid it.\n\nI think what happens with the baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and vinegar (acetic acid) is that it chemically breaks down the urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide, so basically you release all the potential smell in one go instead of slowly over time. Just air out the room afterwards to get rid of the ammonia, and you are done.",

Somebody put up a sign saying that the girls could go to another floor and we all started making fun of it.  When I crashed at my gf\u2019s I\u2019d use the women\u2019s bathroom.  A few times I stepped out of the shower or had a toothbrush in and some girl did a double take then just continued on.",

The sign in the ceiling is a standard symbol to indicate to someone looking down the length of the terminal, that the bathrooms are this way. It would be appropriate if it was somewhere like the entrance to a hallway that leads to both bathrooms. Putting the general guidance sign that close to the bathroom is confusing.",

I live in Mexico, so the bathrooms are labeled H for Hombres (Men) and M for Mujeres (Women). \n\nI was still in \"English speaking\" mode from the show, so I went to the bathrooms and went \"Oh it's M for Men\". I even noticed that the door had an icon for a pizza with a slice missing, and I thought \"Uh that's curious, they missed an opportunity for a clever joke with the men's bathroom being the removed slice and the women's being the pizza with the hole with the missing slice\". When I noticed the complete lack of urinals that's when it hit me: \"Wait! M is not for Men, M is for Mujeres!\" Thank god there was no one in there.\n\nAnd of course, I went to the actual men's bathroom and on the door labeled with an H was a picture of just one slice of pizza...",

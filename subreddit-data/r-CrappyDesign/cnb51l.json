Dealing with small businesses and entrepreneurs  is shit like this. All day. Everyday.\n  \nThe sad thing is, now that im bound to a major account, I have to realize when I'm getting tied to a sinking ship that's gonna drag down my reputation, soul, and company to the inner depths of the hell. I've had to tell clients **no** despite a $7k budget and a \"we need to get this done\" attitude. We're contracted, and to people within our account's company that actually have  standards. The last thing I need is someone we answer to  walking into these dipshits office and them going \"Oh AlamosX helped us!\"\n\nDespite that, Even our overlords throw up their hands. Get it done means get it done.\n\nMy own personal catharsis nowadays is saving every god awful project  to a personal cloud folder which is one day going to be part of my eulogy. It will be a well designed portfolio with all the examples and titled \"why Alamosx died so young\"\n\nIt is going to  be shared to /r/crappydesign as a requirement of my will.",

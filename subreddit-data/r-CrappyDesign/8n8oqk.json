It\u2019s in the wide open position. I *think* even at the odd angle you can see.. the bottom of the door is at least four inches above the toilet bowl.\n\nNot that it isn\u2019t already bad enough, but the bathroom is in a raised portable trailer, so to enter the washroom (with the front door latched open all day) you had to walk up a set of steps, giving you the perfect viewpoint of everyone\u2019s.. bottom.

The vertical mounted bulkhead lights were supposed to be directional variable beam units to highlight art work or a mural on the opposite vertical surface. \n\nClient got the quote for $26K and said fuck it I can do this myself for a $1000 but never adjusted the design for the new product and now he blames, \"that stupid Lighting Designer for my stupid lights.\"\n\n*The bulkhead lights are adjustable.

Once I saw it went in to try and fix it, and the first thing to happen.. slipped and fell on my ass on to the now nasty toilet water soaked carpet) its better to have something water proof covered by a heavy antifatigue non-slip rubber mats instead. \n\nAbout the only things one can do to help reduce/prevent those falls and slips are the following, \n\n1. Wall and potentially fixture mounted grab bars. Lots of them. \n\n2. No high edges to need to step over. Either open area showers with sliding doors, or a tub with a side that opens on its own when needed. \n\n3. Frictional pads, and stickers on flooring. Or otherwise shower slippers that have grip and provide friction, if bare feet fail to work for some odd reason. Plus those non-slip antifatigue rubber mats from before.  \n\n4. Shower, tub side seating... lots of it everywhere.  Sitting down while showering, grab bars nearby. Sitting down when drying off... \n\n5. Waist+ height storage/access to soaps etc. if you can have one of those wall mounted refillable soap/shampoo push dispensers instead of bottles can go a long way to help reduce slips and falls related to having to deal with clutter and dropping/picking up stuff. \n\nKey thing with all of the above is to minimize potential points and activities where slips can occur, but also to help ensure that there are 3 points of contact and support for a person to have when moving around.",

It had no shower, just a clawfoot bathtub with no curtains, and because it was in a corner, there was no easy way to put in a rod. So we lived there about 2 months and one day i came home and dude who actually signed the lease had a mat knofe out and was just tearing it all out of the bathroom and kitchen. We all helped and he got some cheap, roll on sticky linoleum and put it down. I can honestly say the improvement betwen \u201cregular house floor\u201d and the most glorious, exquisite polished meteor rock tile was far less impressive than the improvement between 60s shag carpeting and bottom bin sticker flooring. Was beautiful.",

Grass, like what you find in someone\u2019s yard, wasn\u2019t a dominant plant life and for a while you\u2019d be hard pressed to find that much of it growing anywhere in large concentrations. \n\nThen a few rich plantation owners wanted to flex and now I have to mow the lawn every fucking weekend.\n\nThough don\u2019t get me wrong. It is really nice to have. Soft, and you can enjoy the comfort of walking around in it. Much better than what the natural alternative is. Just think it\u2019s funny that everyone mows their lawn these days because a few people wanted to make it a status symbol\n\nEdit: now that I think of it the alternative might not be too bad. You\u2019d still have ground soil and not a lot of rocks. There\u2019d probably be a lot more clover and whatnot which is easier to maintain and almost equally as soft and pleasing to the eye.",

I finally listened to a friend and scheduled a visit for a chiropractor who was in my network (I had like platinum insurance so my deductible was nothing). Consultation was just, I don\u2019t know, off. Like he was doing CT scans of my neck and back, and when I\u2019d try to stand up straight he would tell me to hunch or put me in a weird position. So we get the results and of course my neck and back are completely fucked up. Three visits a week in perpetuity. Ok as long as my back gets fixed, I\u2019ll try anything. It\u2019s going to cost me like $60 a week. So I don\u2019t think anything of it and go to my first appointment and he cracks my neck, I immediately told him I never wanted that done again as it just didn\u2019t feel natural. He finished with my back and I just felt really off. So I go to pay, what I\u2019m thinking is $20 for my copay, the lady tells me they need a down payment of $3600. I said no I have great insurance and already spoke to my insurer and your in network and it would be a copay of $20 until I hit my super low deductible. Now the chiropractor comes over and he\u2019s like no we deal with this a lot, that money is for what insurance doesn\u2019t cover. He also states I need to book the same day and time every week. I tell him I\u2019ll pay for the one visit and I\u2019m off. He calls and e-mails everyday for like two weeks stating that I\u2019m missing appt\u2019s (I never booked) and that he\u2019s going to send me to collections (I never signed anything or agreed that I was going to see this chiropractor long term). Dude was super shady and had antivax propaganda all over the place.",

Couldn\u2019t look up, couldn\u2019t do lots of shit. Like we were very concerned to the point of like, maybe they may need to get put down. \n\nOur vet recommended this guys and we had like 10 sessions with him. Dogs improved and regained full range of motion. No issues for several years and they got to pass on of old age. \n\nFew years later, was doing push ups and exhaled wrong while descending and felt something tweak or pop in my right back rib area (between lower right part of shoulder blade and spine).  I try icing it, heat, tiger balm etc and it stops kind of hurting but I can tell that spot is still tweaked. I just kind of deal with it, and for a few years just do some daily stretching and twist rotations to kind of pop my back which helps. But I\u2019m just annoyed. So I go to this guy and he does the adjustments, etc and it helps. Eventually (after a half year of monthly visits)  stops hurting  and I feel normal.  Stoped going after a year because I figured I didn\u2019t need it and plus I moved so it\u2019s inconvenient for me. \n\nWell the pain/stuck feeling is back.\n\nAnyway all of this is to say that in general I agree the chiro is not a cure-all and should be approached cautiously and with care, but in the moment it does provide immediate relief.\n\nAnyway if you\u2019ve ever heard of injuries:tweaks like mine, would love to hear about or see videos on stretches/exercises that might help me get rid of the problem all together.",

I'll never understand why they're so violent about it when they should know better other than that it's for show so they make you think they're a miracle worker by violently forcing an adjustment instantly instead of over time through like a thirty or sixty minute session. Also especially dangerous with the neck because you can literally give someone a stroke by damaging blood vessels doing that.\n\n\n\nGuess they get paid more that way and can afford lawyers for when they hurt somebody while still taking home six figures.",

I worked with a guy who worked with cancer patients, you can't really do any real work other than therapeutic touch just because massage exacerbates the lymphatic system, and we aren't doctors so we don't know what that's going to do with the cancer, but it did wonders just for them to be relaxingly touched for a while. People would come in all the time with chronic pain and it would help immensely. Sometimes even just giving someone advice on how to heal was great. Really fulfilling work and scientifically proven unlike chiropractics.\n\n\nI burned out on low pay working for a chain place but it was often really rewarding work.",

There are risks when they pop your neck and back so they have to be good if you let them do that to you.

Some chiropractors also think they are doctors and have actually made covid statements that went against cdc protocols etc. \n\nBut just try googling what it is, start with Wikipedia and the history of chiropractic therapy. It\u2019s not based on anything that was ever proven by research. It\u2019s hit and miss with consistency of care.",

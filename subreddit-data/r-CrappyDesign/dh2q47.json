That being said, you\u2019d certainly bench more on a real bench press if you were reasonably well trained benching with a smith machine. It\u2019s mostly that you were untrained on a different movement pattern, but the joint angles and all that are still very similar so you\u2019d still get a lot of transference between the two. \n\n\nI think people trash the smith machine a little too much, for strictly bodybuilding there\u2019s no issue with it. Powerlifting yes, but even then if you just use it as an accessory movement to your main barbell lifts it\u2019s fine and can help your core lifts.\n\n\nEdit: also I\u2019d like to add as a caveat, new lifters should absolutely be encouraged to do any weight training at all, so scaring them or looking down on them for using the smith machine isn\u2019t cool. People start where they feel comfortable and should be encouraged until they feel comfortable enough to move on to more advanced lifting.",

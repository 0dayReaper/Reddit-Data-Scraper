They also labeled the matter as Confirmed though.\n\nI dare say you could probably test anything that might be exposed to humans and find traces of fecal matter. You know from when people fart in that general direction, a lot of the smell is aerosol feces there too. \n\nReally though people worry way too much about this shit. You don't *need* a sterilized environment to remain healthy, that might not even be terribly healthy for things to which exposure is how you breed immunity. Though really either way your chances of actually catching anything are pretty minimal.\n\nAs for the ingrained squeamishness towards bodily excretions well... hey look that shit is literally inside you right now. You spent at least a portion of your most vulnerable period in life basting in it. Maybe we can culturally relax just a bit and clean it up without it being the worst thing in the universe or whatever. ",

Walked over to the bathroom in the pitch-black, no glasses on -- no lights, because I don't want to struggle to fall back asleep. Reached to feel if the lid was up so I could sit down (again, peeing in the dark, need to sit). The son of a bitch left the seat up and I nearly broke my hip from falling into the void of the toilet.\n\n\nThe next morning I called him a barbarian and rather than apologize, he said \"Well that's you get for not turning on a light.\"\n\n\nPeople who leave the seat up deserve to be alone. (Edit: apparently this last sentence needs a /S because it wasn't obvious enough)",

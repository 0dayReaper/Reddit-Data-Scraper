If water is at 4\u00b0C then one milliliter weighs about one gram but at 100\u00b0c it's about 0.96 grams. On top of that, the energy required to heat up one gram of water from 10 to 11 degrees isn't the same as from 90 to 91 degrees.\n\nThis is probably why the calorie isn't used in the SI-system since a joule can be defined more easily without water. And yes, I'm fun at parties. I study energy technology",

Not letting the bigger states bully the smaller states. \n\n\nIf you have a direct democracy, the downside is that candidates who are best able to sway the mob mentality and sweet talk them are the ones who win, even if they aren't the better candidate. \n\nBigger states have more people and therefore should get a slightly bigger say in how the federal government is run, however too big of a say would cause an imbalance where the federal government might ignore smaller states too much and cater only to the larger states. \n\nElectoral college is a giant clusterfuck, but its what they came up with at the time to try and solve those two issues. Its been changed alot over the years for better or worse.",

I had the same mindset before the podcast, not so much after, there were some pretty sound reasons for it. The major one was the only thing he had time for before was to talk about Nixon, how to handle him, what to do about him etc. There was no time to actually run the country. He discussed it at lengths with the White House lawyers and they came to the conclusion that was the best course of action. Not because he didn\u2019t think Nixon deserved something else, but because he thought USA deserved something better - fully aware that the majority would not understand the basis of his decision. \n\nThat is something we rarely see in politicians in any day of age. The guts to make a decision for what they believe is the greater good, at the cost of themselves.\n\n*edit: as u/DonLeoRaphMike suggested. This is from Reveals podcast \u201dPardon me\u201d. One of the podcasts on my must listen-list. :)",

Feet and miles are used for measuring completely different things that it basically doesn't matter how simple or complicated it is to convert between them. In the rare occasions when you might want to, rounding a mile off to an even 5000 feet is typically more than sufficient. (We're cruising at 30,000 feet? That's like 6 miles!)\n\nIt's kind of like when you start measuring distances in space and you throw both of these systems out the window because now you're using AU or light years to measure things.\n\nAnyway I think moving to metric has its merits and I'd be happy to go along with it, but it's really not a big deal or we'd have done it already.",

If you look on a carton of milk, you'll see that rather than being labelled as a pint it's labelled as \"568 millilitres\", although sometimes there is also labelling in pints. And plenty of milk is now sold in litre units, rather than pints.\n\nDifferent kinds of milk from the same outlet can even be sold in different units (although still labeled in metric). For example:\n\n[Tesco Filtered Skimmed Milk: 2L](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/253743128)\n\n[Tesco Skimmed Milk: 2.272L](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/254656508)\n\nFunny old world.",

Pounds, feet, and inches are really only used when dealing with measuring people (informally) and in construction. Construction forces our hand due to dealing with the US, it's way easier just to build everything in the same way they do. Grams and kilograms are used for most products, as are milliliters and litres, the exception comes with cooking. Like construction, it's just easier to do what the US does, and even then instructions are written in both formats on most packaging. If the US officially switched to metric we could go fully over practically overnight, it's simply a matter of convenience that we keep a couple of the old systems around.",

Half the planet almost never experiences freezing temperatures, and no part ever experiences anything even remotely close to boiling. Freezing and boiling temperatures are also wildly variable depending on altitude and mineral content of the water. \n\nFahrenheit is based around a 0-100 scale of what a large percentage of Earth\u2019s population can be expected to experience over time. Below 0 and above 100 are the remarkable extremes. Oh, that's not logical? I'm sorry, I was under the impression that we use 0-100 scales all the time in all sorts of ways. Silly me. Wait, isn't Celsius a 0-100 scale? Oh yeah, but they only typically use -15 to 40 of it. Makes sense.  \n\nWater typically freezes at around 32, which isn\u2019t really that cold and not exactly hard to remember anything below that may have ice... but apparently they need the visual and auditory reminder in the form of a minus symbol every single time a temperature happens to be below freezing. In addition, F is almost twice as granular as C, leading to a more accurate temperature without having to resort to decimals. Their arguments almost always boil down to \"durr hurr Americans everything stupid.\"\n\nK for science, F for weather if we insist on having multiple scales.",

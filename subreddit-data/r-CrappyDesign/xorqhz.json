Something you don't understand does not make the design of that item crappy design. Not every ramp you see is meant for wheelchair access. Not every item that puzzles you is bad design. Items which are installed badly or broken are not crappy design.**\n\nSo please refrain from  posting ugly fabrics, devices you haven't been able to figure out, random things that puzzle you and the like. *This is not a complete list and all submissions are subject to mod review.*\n\n\n**This past weekend we saw a rule breaking post with not only identifying information but phone numbers  and a comment section full of comments harassing the people pictured. This is unacceptable. Posts like this are not only against our rules but against reddit's site wide rules as well. All personal identifying information must be redacted. Comments sexualizing subjects of posts here will result in a  permanent ban.**",

Side note: I always pictured this sub as targeting design companies and brands that SHOULD know better- kind of a way to punch up and hold those companies accountable for their lackluster designs. I never ever hoped or wanted it to be a way to target non-designers or local businesses. Those people really genuinely don't know how to design and shouldn't be held to a very high standard because they're just trying to get people in the door and they don't have a whole design department.",

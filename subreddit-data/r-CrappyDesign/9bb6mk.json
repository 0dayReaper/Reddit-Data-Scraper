You create a product that you market to professionals - knowing that a large portion of your professional customers rely heavily on keyboard shortcuts to get things done quickly. The whole point of a Keyboard shortcut is that it sort of functions within a touch typing framework. But now you're going to force everyone to look down because there's no tactile way to identify the shortcut that you're looking for on the keyboard. \nWtf thought that was a good idea!?",

The reason people used to buy a Mac was because they were either wanted a simple computer or were a graphic/video editor. That drove alot of decisions such as disabling the right mouse click. Instead of hiding menu options somewhere that doesn\u2019t make sense visually and intuitively (whereas my windows support calls consisted of questions concerning whether to left or right click all of the time). They just made sure to put those options in the menus. MacOS almost always shows the menu at top. ",

Maybe press a lever on the side that pops up a board to catapult the item off? Or do you touch and manipulate the object directly?\n\nRight clicking on the object one wishes to change is more direct and intuitive. Indirectly controlling selected objects with a menu on a mac to avoid right clicking is less intuitive, though it can be more simple: EX: A road designed by Apple would have no intersections, stoplights, medians, or other cars. It would be a one lane road that connected to every house and business and had one car, as that is the easiest model to understand, and it's the simplest... It just also happens to be the least efficient.\n\nBuilding on that with a real example: Toggling between Wifi and 4G on an old Android cellphone took a swipe down, two clicks, and a swipe up to get back to what you were doing. On and iPhone it took over a dozen actions, because that was simpler: Exit the app, swipe to settings, click settings, scroll through settings, click wifi, click toggle, click back, scroll, click cellular settings, click data settings, exit settings, scroll to previous app, click previous app.",

Nowadays context menus are more common, though. And the reason it can be disabled is because the the actual button is below the mouse, so it gets pressed when you press the mouse against the table. There's just one mechanical button below the mouse.To make a right click, the mouse surface is touch-enabled, so it detects your finger is on the right area and makes a right click when you press the mouse. Even the 'click' sound is just software, a sound effect played by a speaker inside the mouse.\nIt's not as bad as it sounds when you get used to it, especially on the current model (Magic Mouse).",

Charge it overnight then, you say? Well sure, but iMacs don't provide USB power when they're off, so you have to leave the dang thing on all night to charge the mouse. So use a USB plug, you say. Okay, sure, but then I'm crawling under my desk to plug the mouse into a 3 foot cord. \n\nI'm not saying it's the worst thing in the world, but considering literally *only they* have this problem, I consider it essentially the epitome of crappy design. It's a non-problem they've built. ",

Those things on the side where a real mouse would have a back button never seemed to do anything useful. I think it triggered expos\u00e9 or something, which was a completely useless, albeit pretty looking feature. But they never pushed in, it was like a pressure thing. \n\nDidn't feel good at all.

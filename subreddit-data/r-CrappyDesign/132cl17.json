Can't imagine reading a single sentence written like this.\n\nEdit: Ok, so it turns out it's SUPPOSED to say KSW Kingdo. But the lettering is totally wrong and messed up. Real company logo is somewhat better, while clearly not a shining star of graphic design.\n\nhttps://trademarks.justia.com/873/53/ksw-87353667.html",

If the recycling center fills up without having any buyers for recycled material, it goes to the dump.\n\nI don't disagree that the advertising for recycling is misleading, when there is a good chance your recyclable item might get thrown away. It's not the recycling facility that is the problem per se, it's capitalism.",

We definitely do not use those words.\n\nI suggest you do a bit of research about how languages work and evolve over time. If you spoke to someone from the 14th century you wouldn't understand them even though you both spoke \"English\".",

Soft plastics are almost universally not recycled in the UK, so they warrant the last symbol. The blue symbol is used to inform the person to check their local recycling guidelines. The green symbol is used for things that are almost universally recycled in the UK.\n\nHowever, despite this clarity, people still get confused because of resin symbols etc., or have just become apathetic towards the idea of recycling because of mixed messaging.",

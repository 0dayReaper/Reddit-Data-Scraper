Teach them not to approach strange dogs, nor run in the street. But if it is nature, we  Instead revel in it, watch a thunderstorm from indoors, pick up the bug and move it, oh look there's a garden snake going home!, whatever the fear item might be. For heaven's sake don't burden them with your issues. \n\nHowever fear of the dark is NOT something passed on , usually. Children lay in their rooms in the dark and their little imaginations conjure up bogeymen or monsters. Plus (forgive me Disney lovers)  all that Disney crap with witches and bad guys and such.....this is what triggers fear of the dark. It is fear of the unknown.    So a nightlight is a good thing. Checking under the bed is fine.   A spritz of lavender mist is Monster repellent. Fear of the dark is a common fear. Most of us outgrow it. ",

They pick up on it almost super-humanly because they're information sponges the first several years of life. There's even things you pass on without it being genetic or taught, hence why some doctors will ask if you have certain histories in the family like addictions. And of course everyone has their own weaknesses in and of themselves, it's just life unfortunately.",

He'd make twist tie spiders on fishing line to scare Mom while watching movies.\n\nNone of this fazed me.\n\nOne day, Mom was in the pantry, open to the kitchen where my sister stood, leading to the door I was opening from the living room. A spider scared Mom into a blood curdling scream, followed by a higher scream from my sister, and an even more glass shattering scream from me.

My dad often finishes these public freakouts early, then talks to the parents if they're concerned.\n\nAnd if you are ever personally afraid of your kid tripping or skinning their knees, think about the last time you fell down. Did you cry? Of course not. That kid didn't even fall half as far as you did. They're fine. Don't freak them out by being dramatic.\n\nNot a big point to this story, I just love my dad.",

The sign is manipulative even if it were true.  \n\nUnfortunately there aren't signs with pictures of people whose lives were ruined because they had a kid they weren't prepared for.",

Show me proof that all or most \"pro-life\" are actually doing meaningful actions to protect human life **after birth**. \n\nIn my experience, they don't care at all about the mother or the child after the birth, but still think they get a saying on other people's body. So, they're not pro-life, they're just pro-birth.",

It's wild that a buch of non-biblical garbage from one sect of one religion continues to dominate the conversation 150+ years later.",

There were some good points raised on both sides (I still think so now), but in the end the pro-life side lost. That got me thinking about why. How could anyone possibly support abortion? It was only when I really gave the matter some thought that I started to see alternative perspectives, and that changed my mind over time.\n\nAlso, I looked around and saw who the other people were on the pro-life side. Some were generally well-meaning, but most of them were arrogant right-wingers of the sort I\u2019d normally cross the street to avoid. Why was it, I asked myself, that all the people I agreed with on every other political issue were against me on this one point? Again, that got me thinking and I realised there was a lot more to the issue than \u201ckilling babies\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately I was unable to bring anyone with me when I crossed to the other side.",

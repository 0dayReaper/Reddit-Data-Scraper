Got paid by both the town and railway company.\n\nAnother tripped over a loose piece of flooring in the city plaza and broke a wrist. \n\nI think a class action started because of the genius flooring choice in that station, my friend was one of many to get fucked up.",

It\u2019s a nightmare when it rains. My dad snapped his fucking patellar tendon by slipping on a POLISHED GRANITE STAIRCASE that was INSIDE an apartment building, with no carpet or any sort of traction grip, on a rainy night in Italy bc his shoes were wet. This goddamn staircase cut his vacation to come see me, and his very first time in Europe at age 54, short after only 2 days. And then the paramedics could barely get him down the stairs because Accessible Building Codes don\u2019t seem to be a thing in most European countries.",

The majority of the time land ownership stops at the ROW (easement for the municipal/County/State roadway) and the city owns everything inside of that. On a rare occasion I have seen odd subdivision of land where property lines extend to the centerline of the roadway and there is half an access easement on each one. This is usually when there is a private owner and they don't want anything to do with the City so everything is on wells and propane and septic tanks.",

After the pavers are in place, the next and final step is sweeping polysand over the whole thing and running the plate compactor over it to vibrate the sand into all the cracks, then you sweep off the excess and wet the whole thing down, which locks the pavers in place.  \n\nSo if that's what we're looking at, then this is just watered down and after it's dry it will be solid and grippy. But lots of people seem convinced that we're looking at stamped concrete, so who knows. It's a low quality picture. I tried zooming in but it's just blurry.",

The city had extremely strict requirements if you happened to cut into the sidewalk for any reason and did a repair (plumbing cuts, new driveway cuts, etc.).  The version shown in the image would have been condemned and required to be replaced.",

I can't affect the process. But I fear this nonetheless. I have no control over something that'll affect me in a very real way, and it's terrifying.\nSo please, US americans. Use that precious democratic system you have. Make it count. Call your representatives, bombard the FCC with your opinion.\nThe internet is not a luxury. It is a nessecity. Humanity needs it free. Shortsighted profiteering at the cost of societal development on a global scale is abhorrent and should be fought with any means possible.\nI will do my best to spread the word, to make as many US americans realize the threat to their freedoms as I can. But that's all I can do.\nAgain, US americans. You can fight for the freedoms your soldiers protect. Do it.",

I also want to list examples of ISPs being slimey, like when they throttled Netflix's bandwidth. Remind them that if you or I had done that, we would be in jail.

This is an issue of protecting people who have no power from companies who have it all, for a service that these companies themselves have made necessary. This is also not an issue of fearmongering.

Interns and staffers make notes of the viewpoints of constituents who call in and pass that information along, and internal tallies of the positions taken in those calls do affect their decisions. The more calls and the more lopsided the tally, the more likely senators are to be influenced.\n\n&gt;But if you have more time, please consider writing a letter to the editor that mentions your senator by name, and try to get it published in one of the five or ten biggest newspapers in your state. Many offices circulate an internal document every morning that the senator and his/her top staffers receive. This document includes important state, national, and world news, as well as any letters to the editor in their home states' major papers that mention the senator by name.\n\n&gt;Source: I worked in a senator's office one summer and regularly helped compile and distribute the daily document. Copies went out to about 20 staffers, and one copy was put on the senator's desk every morning. It was the first thing he read when he got to the office. I also saw interns/staffers from other senators' office printing off similar documents for their bosses in the basement printing room, so I know our office wasn't the only one using this process.\n\n&gt;TL;DR:\n\n&gt;Calls are useful and efficient--but if you have the time, letters to the editor published in a local/regional newspaper are even more effective. Do both if at all possible.",

Your phone company can't charge you more or provide a worse service if you are calling a business that uses a competitor.\n\n&gt;The anti net neutrality rules will let your internet provider block access to sites or slow down access to sites unless you agree to pay more.  \n\n&gt;Do you like to watch Netflix in high-definition?  You will pay extra for that.  \n\n&gt;You want to watch the NFL playoffs?  Only Comcast will be showing them.  \n\n&gt;You want to download your iTunes library?

This sets a dangerous precedent.\n\nOne easy way to help us out is just simply sharing this all around. Make everyone informed. If the entire *WORLD* hates this, it will be an even stronger case. This also helps keep other counties from falling victim to the same issues.\n\nAmericans aren\u2019t informed enough to prevent it easily here, however, people around the world can attempt to educate others on the situation. The more that know, the better.\n\nAwareness protects other counties and gives the US chance. Donations give the US even more of a chance and spread even more awareness.\n\nI encourage anyone to just mention this, to atleast a few who don\u2019t know about it. It might just be the change we globally need to prevent it from happening anywhere else.",

The point of data visualization is increasing legibility and one of the things that help with that is a good and clear legend. This graph is clearly focused on an American, English speaking audience, so organizing from left to right, top to bottom would make the most sense. Whether you go for increasing or decreasing after that is largely arbitrary, although I would go for lowest top left, highest bottom right.\n\nOSCgal's \"fix\" would be the legend equivalent of \"Don't Dead, Open Inside\".",

They just didn\u2019t bother arranging the legend properly. \n\nWhat is crappy is that the incidence reported is completely useless: incidents of heart worm reported per clinic? So, a large clinic serving a large area with a 5% infection rate in their patients will have a higher reported incidence of heart worm than a small clinic with a 90% infection rate in their patient population. Their layout skills are the least of their problems.",

Prevention on the other hand is easy, and there are many competing products on the market that you can use, none of which are pushed over any others with this poster.\n\nI do agree with many others in this thread that this information is rather poorly presented.

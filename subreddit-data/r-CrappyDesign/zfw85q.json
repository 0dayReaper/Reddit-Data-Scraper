The Pacific is noticeably saltier than the Atlantic, for example (some even claim they can taste the difference), and the southern ocean also has a different composition ( and sometimes color) due to the circumpolar currents. The Atlantic basin is also a lot younger than the Pacific, which means that the oceanic crust floats higher on the mantle. The more you know.",

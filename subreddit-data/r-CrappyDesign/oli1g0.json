Everyone that isn't an old fart just uses a hand scanner to scan their groceries and pack them in bags *before* checkout, so while collecting them in the store. At the exit you simply put the scanner back and pay with debit card. Once in a blue moon you'll get a bag check though, and they'll take a few random items out to re-scan to see if you missed anything.",

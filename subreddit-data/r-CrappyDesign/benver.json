At literally this washroom in Pearson but with an unfortunate twist.\n\nFlew on a sleepless Red Eye after a long conference work-day. Five hours across 3/4 of the country, land at 4:30 in the morning. I decide to get same breakfast before my connecting flight in three hours. Then afterwards as I'm walking towards the end of the terminal to check-in I obviously have to, like fate ascended on me, use the washroom. This washroom with it's stupid sign. The backwards sign. \n\nWithout sleep in ~24 hours I just looked up and unconsciously I walked into the bathroom. I don't even remember looking at the sign up top. Just walking to the one on the left. I didn't even know what I had just done.\n\nFive minutes later I walk out of there having done my business in my slow not awake fashion, fresh faced from a little water to the face, combed my hair. Looking like a person pretending not to be a walking zombie. Nothing happened. No one walked in and I had no idea, just walked down to the end of the the terminal I needed to be on. \n\nThen as though written from a movie script,\n\n*terminal broadcast turning on*\n\n&gt;Attention travelers, there was a cell phone left in the women's washroom of Terminal 3. Please come to Gate 9 to claim.\n\n**my brain**: *ha, that would suck losing your phone in the airport. I better check my messages. Wait where is my phone?*\n\nOne pat of the left pocket. One on the right. Check horribly wrinkled suit pockets. **Oh no...no no no no no...**\n\nIf I could somehow go back in time to learn the vocabulary to properly describe how I felt when it clicked. Had she said women's washroom? \n\n**Oh no no no no**\n\nThere wasn't enough energy left in my body to get my brain functioning properly and form a set of coherent plans. I had to just suck it up and go to the other end of the terminal and get my phone and come back because my flight was in less than an hour. \n\nThat terminal is not super long but at that moment it looked like I was staring down the longest road. The worst walk of shame. I felt like I was about to turn myself in. \n\n\"Gate 7......Gate 8.....*aahh here we go*....\"\n\nI'm not sure if I had beer goggles on in the moment but I'm pretty sure what was the prettiest looking woman I had laid eyes on in the past year was staring right at me behind the desk of Gate 9.  *of course it's gotta be like this because the script writers hate my character*\n\n\"Hi you have my phone?\"\n\n\"Sir? It was in the wom...\"\n\n\"Yes....I didn't see the sign and used the wrong washroom and left my phone.\"\n\n\"Um...I should..\" \n\n*I'm not sure if she wanted to call security on me or was taken back by my barely assembled molecules trying to pretend to be human. Her face said the first thing.*\n\n\"Please it's a black case with a rubber grip and if you press the power button *klaysDoodle* will show up on the lock screen. I have to get to the other side of the terminal.\"\n\nShe reached down and played with the phone in front of her at the desk. She gave me the look my mom used to give me when she was just disappointed. You know that one? I died a little inside but emotions weren't registering well at that point.\n\nAs soon as that phone came toward me I grabbed it out of her hand and in one motion wheeled my ass to the other side of the terminal. I had to wait for an hour in the terminal and plane before the wheels left the tarmac. Sitting there, head down, waiting to be dragged out of there by the Toronto Police. \n\nFor me that sign represents one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. So far. Only me, my gf, and probably half the staff members at Pearson now know that story. And now all of you. But it's worth it to see that sign die, never to hurt another person again. Justice was done today.\n\n**TL;DR:** Today is a glorious day in my family. The enemy sign has been vanquished and justice has been served.",

This is one situation where we don\u2019t need laws to figure this out. If you\u2019re at a bar and there\u2019s a line for the women\u2019s restroom while the men\u2019s is empty, nobody cares if the woman sneaks into the men\u2019s room. On the other hand, if there\u2019s a dude sneaking into the women\u2019s bathroom and looking through the cracks like a perv, we already have a law that makes it illegal. If some asshole harasses a trans person in a Walmart bathroom, Walmart will ban the asshole from their stores. Problem solved. \n\nIn general, I really think most men and women just feel a lot more comfortable taking poops, standing at a urinal, fixing their makeup, etc. with their own gender. There is nothing inherently wrong with having gendered bathrooms. The problem isn\u2019t gendered bathrooms, the problem is bigots and assholes.",

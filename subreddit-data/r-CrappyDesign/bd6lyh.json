It's a generic term for a well-intentioned action that accidentally produces the opposite of the intended result.\n\nIt is named for a possibly apocryphal anecdote about the British government passing laws in India. According to the story, they were upset about the number of snakes in India, so they offered a reward for dead snakes. People supposedly started breeding more snakes just to claim their reward, so they rescinded the offer. This caused people to release the snakes they were keeping in cages to breed. Basically, every action they took to decrease the number of snakes in India caused an unintended increase.\n\nNot specific to advertising, but otherwise pretty similar to the meaning you described.",

A lot of [people at the time ](https://www.pcr-online.biz/2007/02/15/apples-jibing-mac-campaign-backfires/) interpreted the ad campaign as ineffective. This is because the ad was intended to make the Apple guy seem cool and the PC guy seem like a loser, but a lot of people (especially PC people) interpreted the PC guy as an affable nerd and the Mac guy as a smug douchebag. From what I understand, this was used as a textbook example of a marketting failure around 10 years ago (although I didn't study marketting in college, so this is definitely secondhand). Some people certainly criticized them of artificially trying to draw a line between Mac and PC products; Microsoft even launched a rebuttal campaign.\n\nHowever, Microsoft's rebuttal ended up having a Cobra Effect as well, with [many seeing it as being needlessly defensive](https://velocitypartners.com/blog/microsofts-baffling-im-a-pc-campaign/). Over time, the net effect was solidifying Apples niche in the market as an elitist commodity (see the \"you're too poor to afford Airpods\" meme as an example), and making PC seem like the *status quo* for the masses. Basically, it ended up dignifying Apple's delineation between Macs and PCs and redeemed their original ads in the process.",

Probably you will get a mild stomach ache and take a very oily, floaty, poop later one because you overloaded with more fat than your digestion could absorb, but it all depends on what you eat before/after and the speed of your digestion, some people defecate one a week and others twice a day.\n\nIt's actually not as bad as you might think though. It's only about 800 calories, 90 grams of fat. Like eating a big tub of ice cream without the sugar and other shit.",

            "comment": "Butter is only 100 mg per full tablespoon (which, in turn is 1/8th of a stick, much more than one usually puts on toast, for example - at least 2 generous \"pats\").\n\nUnless you're buttering absolutely everything at every meal (like some Boomers I know who get a full tablespoon packet at a restaurant and make faces when you tell them they shouldn't need a second one for a tiny dinner roll...), butter isn't usually a significant source of sodium in your diet or a dish.\n\nIf you're making a very butter-heavy thing, like my mom's PA Dutch potato filling, which has way more butter in it than normal mashed potatoes for example, then maybe.  But for normal dishes?  Just add a little bit less salt if you use salted butter.  You can be conscious of it; you don't necessarily need to use unsalted for everything.\n\nI mostly only use it for baking, in order to follow recipes more easily and correctly.  And besides, unsalted butter tastes like just about the same as no butter at all, so I'd just as soon do that.\n\nThen again, it depends on how low you're trying to get your sodium intake.  For a typical 2,000 - 2,400 mg per day restriction, there's room for salted butter in moderation.  Much lower than that, though, and I could see it.",

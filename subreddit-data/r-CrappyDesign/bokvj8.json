This post is the correct answer of this thread. \n\nThe reason that it's non-QWERTY is because there are very few situations where you're actually meant to be typing text in, so it's usually not needed, so it's kind of an afterthought of the design. This design is also decades old, so it may be from before a time it seemed obvious to lay it out in qwerty. The reason it hasn't been updated is because it would blow the fucking minds of the old lady ass cashiers that make up half of the cashier staffing.\n\nEdit: to be clear I still think it's very dumb and should be done away with, I'm just trying to give some insight / guesses on why such a bad design has persisted.",

Surely the old cashiers could handle that?",

Considering a computer having a virus is probably the only malfunction event they have some mild understanding of, it makes sense that any time there is an issue with the computer they just say virus instead of \"there's a problem.\" \n\nOld people use jargon they don't really understand to sound like they at least have an understanding of a topic that they are really just bullshitting about, just like anyone else bullshitting about something they don't honestly understand. They won't tell you that the hard-drive is so full of porn that there's no room for a pagefile anymore, that the browser is so full of toolbars they are trying to view web pages through a half inch window, or that they started messing around in system settings and changed something that they shouldn't have. They tell you it has a virus because it is the only non user related means of a computer malfunctioning that they know and to also absolve themselves of having fucked up the computer. \n\nIt's sad to see old people like that because it means they spent all that time on earth and never managed to learn that owning up to your mistakes and preparing to be better in the future  is the essence of integrity. In my opinion that's a terrible way for an individual to show that he or she wasted their life on vanity and saving face rather than becoming a better person.",

This is possible bc of electronic keyboards.",

It's during store meetings, which as per Walmart rule the on-duty manager has to have twice a day and once at the beginning of night shift (10pm). Most the time the on-duty manager is too busy to even remember to have it, so at most there is usually only 1 meeting a day, unless there is some major news or the store manager or corporate is putting too much pressure on them to \"return to normal procedure\". And depending on the manager they might hate the chant and actually skip it altogether. Also a minor note each store has a slightly different chant, usually just one added line.\n\nEdit: also the meetings barely ever have more than 5 associates show up since it interrupts the workflow. No cahiers or door hosts can get away from there area. And CAP usually has too much on their plate, usually an electronic associate and apparel associate will send one person to report back to them. So usually a good percentage of the store doesn't even know the chant.\n\nEdit 2: also for anyone thinking making employees chant at their job is humiliating and cruel; Sam Walton got the idea for it by watching how Chinese businesses function. So their may be some truth to that.",

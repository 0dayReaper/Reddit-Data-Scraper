Even if you have a glass pane within arms reach of the deadbolt, its still not a good idea and likely violates fire code.\n\nDouble barrel dead bolts have very specific industrial uses, and the only way we would sell them is if we installed them ourselves so we could assess the need for one.\n\nNow people can buy the damn things on Amazon and some hardware stores. It's kind of frustrating, to be honest.",

As per your own quote:\n\n&gt;This section does not prohibit the locking of a gate in a fence that secures a residential building from either or **both faces** of the gate ... so long as the locked gate does not prevent egress from the building to the exterior.\n\nNeither side of that gate is in the interior of a building, therefore the gate clearly \"does not prevent egress from the building to the exterior.\"\n\nAs per Chicago 13-060-170:\n&gt;the term \u201csmall building\u201d shall mean a residential building that is both less than four stories high and contains fewer than four residential units.\n\nSo depending on what kind of building this is securing (and we only see 3 mailboxes in the picture) this could be to code.\n\nIt's possible this is just securing the side/back yard of a three flat, for example, which would likely make this perfectly fine.",

That's simple theft and would probably be a misdemeanor or minor infraction -- unless the item stolen was valuable or US Mail or some other special circumstance. \n\nBut by putting a locked gate there, the criminal jumping/breaking/picking/whatever is now illegally entering a residence and is committing a burglary. Burglary is almost always a felony regardless of what was actually stolen.\n\nThere are guys doing life in prison (in California especially with the 3 strike felony rule) because of a door or gate that was between them and what they stole.",

Just because you don't like the design, does not mean it's a crappy design.  Also, I have no clue what Rainier Athletes are, I just used...my brain to interpret it, and it took less than a second.  Often times these are crappy designs, but the words really aren't that hard to figure out, pronunciation also plays no part.  It's still easy to read.",

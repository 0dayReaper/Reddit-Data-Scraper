I'm sure the school is up to code with other fire escape routes, but I felt that people should have the information if they do see a similar situation elsewhere. \n\n2) OSHA is for work place safety. There are other agencies with similar codes that would be more relevant to a school specifically. The reason I posted the OSHA codes is because that's what I'm trained in. I knew the code and how to quickly find exactly what I was looking for.",

Because those areas are where the fresh water/food/transportation/resources were.

Each pod was roughly hexagonal and each classroom a wedge.\n\nAnyway, it could get interesting. The hallways basically just flowed in a direction, and so you just went with whichever direction it was going and let the sea of people take you 'round to your next pod.\n\nThe upside was there were multiple exterior doors in each pod, so there was a likelihood that you'd be in a classroom with an exterior door.\n\nOnce I had a substitute teacher take myself and the two girls in the class out for Starbucks. Idk why we were the only four people there that day, but there was some kind of shit going on and almost nobody went to school on that particular occasion.\n\nIn the main section of the school there were something like 5 classrooms per pod per floor, 5 pods (A-E), and two floors, for a total of around 50 classrooms supporting about 30 each for a total capacity of about 1,500. More pods and rooms were tacked on and it eventually housed nearly 2,000 students before being torn down and replaced across the highway.",

There is likely fire exits on each wing and they may possibly act as entrances/exits during normal operations as well. So the issue would only be when everyone have to switch classrooms and all go through the center of the school. Of course I could be wrong and this is the only entrance and possibly even the only fire exit.",

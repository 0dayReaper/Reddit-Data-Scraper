This leads to:\nNot enough observations, not enough time to react, not enough space or time to act. A lot of stuff can be easily avoided if you are very aware of the things going on, and thus you don't need to end up in a situation where you're basically rolling the dice on whether you crash or not",

What I would have done in that situation (with the luxury of thinking about it on my chair obviously) would have been to put the car in neutral and brake. \nHer idea instead was to go off road right into a tree to stop. Totally insane idea, and she was lucky she suffered only minor injuries, but it's frightening how the brain can react under stress.",

We panic and we do stupid stuff, it's an unfortunate side effect of the human condition. We see this on motorcycles all the time - something happens outside their expectations and they immediately jump to a response, any response, regardless of whether it's the best choice. \n\nIt's really fucking easy to sit at a keyboard and preach about how everyone else sucks and it's oh so obvious what the best course of action is but in the moment when things are actually going wrong, it becomes very hard to remember any training we had because it's used so infrequently.\n\nI can't find it at the moment but there's a movie that depicts this pretty well. A guy is training on how to solve system malfunctions on a spaceship and the test environment is built with a ton of distractions and the dude just fails over and over again because it's hard to block out all the noise and hone our focus.\n\nEdit: sorry, the reason I made this comment is because something similar happened to me. My old truck's brakes failed due to a rotting brake line and I rear-ended someone. Luckily it wasn't a bad accident (I got down to maybe ~15-20mph before they failed) but when it happened I just kept trying to pump the brakes. I had maybe less than 5 seconds from failure to crash and while I could have, say, hit the e-brake or yanked the transmission into reverse/park, that was all hindsight. In the moment, I wanted the brakes and they weren't working and I didn't know why and my brain wasn't giving me any other solutions.\n\nI'm sure someone out there criticized me with nearly the exact same language you used and that's why it irks me. Because people don't know the context and make snap judgments.",

A lot of people only know what to do when conditions are perfect.\n\nI also lost brakes one time on a steep decline (brake fluid container thing issue). Immediately went from the e brake like it was routine. It was the first time it had happened.\n\nBut I also have specifically practiced sliding/cornering with the e brake, cornering, recovery and highspeed driving. So my brain has a different toolset so to speak, when presented with a driving-related emergency. Most people maybe only use the e brake when parking on a steep hill if they even remember then. So the brain doesn't associate that action as a solution to anything.\n\nWe would have far far far fewer accidents if people had to pass essentially tactical driving training where limits are pushed and you really learn the physics of the car. More importantly you train your brain how to react when everything goes to shit and how to prevent that.",

At the same time, it's hard to practice what to do in *every* situation and sometimes the experience we do have isn't enough. Having some basic rote experience would come in handy I just don't know how much would ever be \"enough\".\n\nIn my case, even though I could have pulled the e-brake, it would not have helped. By the time I realized that my brakes were actually gone, I was going to hit that car no matter what I did. Which, I guess, is more overall point here. The crash in the OP looks bad but we don't know the context behind it. So many people are assuming the driver was simply an idiot but they're doing so without knowing the full story.\n\n\"This kind of thing would never happen to me\" says every person before it happens to them.",

I tried everything i could think of to slow myself down, I basically stood on the brake, pulled the parking brake and turned the car out in a field to keep from smashing into the van in front of me. Finally with all my panicked movements it slid the floor mat around enough to dislodge. Pure terror.\n\nEdit: to all the people telling me to put the vehicle in neutral. \nThank you.\nBut holy fuck balls I couldnt be rational because I was scared out of my God damn gourd. \nShit fire.\n\nEdit 2: y'all are just fantastic little buggers. Thank you for letting me know my reaction was overkill. Parking brakes exist on more than just the floor. Vehicles dont stop on dimes. \n\nHave I covered my bases or are you going to tell me my shirt was the wrong color that day or that my underwear was on backwards and that's why it happened?",

The engine may rev high.  This is normal.\n# Twist ignition key until engine shuts off but not all the way to Off.  Turning the key all the way to Off may engage steering lock, which prevents any steering inputs. \n# See how the steering feels w/o power steering.  Heavy, but still usable.\n# See how the brakes feel w/o vacuum assist.  Very stiff, but still present.  \n# Press hard, very hard on the brakes to come to a complete halt.  Yup, very heavy.\n# Turn ignition completely off.  Congrats, you survived a runaway throttle, or a complete loss of power.\n# Repeat if you wish.\n\nThis will get you comfortable with putting the car in neutral if needed, and shutting engine if needed.

Hulk out on that lever all you want, there's a [fun physics trick](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=braking+weight+transfer#imgrc=aNIq1sYqqgMvLM:) that guarantees they won't do much even if you lock up the rear wheels.\n\n&gt; turned the car out in a field\n\nPerfect, any time I'm braking hard this is my reaction as well.\n\n---\n\nSo the two other things to do in this situation are:\n\n1. Shift to neutral or disengage the clutch.\n\n2. **Edit: If for some reason you can't,** shut off the engine, you know, with the keys, **preferably to the ACC position so your steering doesn't lock**.\n\nYou can't be blamed for not doing this in a panic, but you'd be surprised how many stories come up if you google \"police chase accelerator stuck\" - people will run out of gas without either of these crossing their mind.",

It totally bypasses the ABS systems and other electronics and applies only the rear brakes with a cable rather than the normal hydraulic system. If you\u2019re moving, this is a fantastic way to lose control of the car. It\u2019s intended to hold the brakes while the car is parked, not to stop the car while it\u2019s moving. If you have the ability to use the normal foot brake, it will be more effective 100% of the time. Using the parking brake along with the foot brake is really only locking up the back wheels for no reason. It doesn\u2019t help you stop quicker, it only makes it harder to stop and now you\u2019re fighting to keep the car under control.\n\nThe ONLY reason to ever use your parking brake besides for parking is if your hydraulic brakes completely fail which will probably never happen to anyone reading this. I\u2019ve blown brake lines multiple times and still had braking power.\n\nIn the off chance that this happens, CAREFULLY and slowly apply the parking brake. If it\u2019s a handbrake, hold the button as you pull it so that you can easily release the brakes if you need to. If it\u2019s a foot brake like in SUVs and pickups, reach down and hold the release lever for the same reason. You don\u2019t want to be fighting the ratcheting mechanism. If you apply the brake fully, there\u2019s a good chance the wheels will lock and that is almost always bad.",

I lacked most rational thought when this happened as most people would when they are petrified.  So in my brain stopping myself meant regular brake and parking brake and getting away from as many cars as I could. \n\nStopping before I hit 100 mph was my  goal.  Silly me .",

One involved software malfunctions, while the other blamed floor mats that slid around and pinned the pedals down.\n\n&gt;But according to Gladwell, the software explanation doesn\u2019t hold up considering the fact that multiple tests have shown that even when a driver is pushing the throttle to the floor, hitting the brakes will stop the car.\n&gt;The real culprit? Human error. More often than not, drivers who reported that their accelerators were stuck were inadvertently flooring it and thinking they were pressing the brakes. Data from many of the \u201cblack boxes\u201d from cars involved in incidents of unintended acceleration showed that in most cases, the brakes were never even touched. \n\n&gt;And an investigation by the Department of Transportation in 2011 found that floor mats only accounted for a small fraction the accidents.\n\n\nhttps://www.manufacturing.net/blog/2016/08/2009-toyota-accelerator-scandal-wasnt-what-it-seemed",

I was following my dad and driving behind him, we were just exiting a tunnel going from 80 mh to 120 kmh, so with my puny engine, I floored it to catch up to his better car. Well, my gas pedal got caught underneath the floor mat. I took my foot off the gas and immediately realized that I was about to crash into my dad's car, with my own car. The first thought that went through my head was \"how the fuck am I going to explain this to the insurance company\".\n\nI took my left foot off the clutch and onto the brake, braking gently enough to slow down only a little, and used my right foot to rapidly kick the gas. At this point, I of course had zero knowledge of the actual cause of this fault, I just knew my gas pedal was stuck, so kicking it felt like the best thing to do. After about 500 meters of panicked kicking, I had gotten it dislodged, and as I was finally calming down, I thought \"why exactly didn't I take it out of gear?\"\n\nAnyway I followed my dad carefully to wherever we were going, and making sure to only use my gas pedal sparingly, and once we stopped, I briefly investigated the issue, replicated it without the the engine running, and immediately ripped out the shitty carpets, tossing them on the floor in disgust. I explained it to my dad, and I had new, genuine floormats within a week.\n\nThat was hella frightening.",

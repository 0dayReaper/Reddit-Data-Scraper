I used to install AV systems and I had a client that was quite wealthy from Africa and he was all about putting in what I would consider frivolous \"improvements\" to his house. Every hallway had in-ceiling and in-wall speakers to the point that his rack in his basement had 4 different home theater receivers he'd buy from various electronics retailers, rigged up to power his home theater system and the other random speakers. Tried to show him how an actual multi-zone amplifier would better benefit him and keep things in sync and he \"liked to have different music in different parts of the house\". His house sounded like an arcade because his kids would have each of the receivers playing their music (all from in-wall iPod docks that I am sure are super useful in 2022). Always struck me as kind of nuts. Normally a salesperson would design a system for someone and I'd go install it. This guy bought his own stuff and would pay by the hour. I installed 12 of the crappiest Dynex 720p TV's throughout this guy's house back in the day because he was able to get a deal on a pallet of them. We're talking in every bathroom, kitchen, garage, laundry room, utility room, etc. He didn't want us to conceal any wires or move outlets near the TV's nor did he want us to run cable so he bought antennas for us to double stick tape to the back of the TV's that didn't get reception in his giant house. I thought for sure my boss' would never get paid for the job as it was generally terrible end product (of the customers design) but he paid without issue.",

You'd think in a low-cost-of-labor environment you'd see a lot more labor intensive detail work. Iron working, scrollwork, precise tile layouts, these are a few of the usual hallmarks of low-cost-of-labor architecture. Since we're not seeing much of that, instead just cobbled together ostentatiousness, quantity over quality, I think much like the McMansions in the US, this is the house of someone who's not actually doing *that* much better than the average person, just someone who wants to feel like they are. \n\nBut I could be wrong, clearly this isn't impressing me, but perhaps I'm not reading the status symbols right.\n\nEdit: you know what, I think I'm letting the gaucheness of the columns influence me a little too much, this actually isn't bad aside from those. The brick driveway and yard was clearly labor intensive, I bet that stonework was pretty hard, and a few other things seem more like taste differences from a Western perspective and not objectively wrong.

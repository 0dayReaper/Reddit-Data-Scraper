Unfortunately, visual merchandising isn\u2019t much of a priority anymore and associates are doing all that work which should be done by dedicated visual merchandisers. That\u2019s why great displays are now only seen at Saks, Bergdorf, etc and they still pale in comparison to displays of the 50s and 60s. All reasons retail is dying",

Filmed somewhere in Eastern Europe, it opens with a terrified young woman, naked and chained to a radiator in an empty room. At this point the footage starts to speed up, as if the camera were capturing minute, tantalizingly close up close-up close-ups of her anus. And then, shockingly, the camera angle bends up at the woman's butt and begins zooming in on her anus. At the same time, a woman who appears to be her sister is being strangled to death by what appears to be the same murderer. It's difficult to imagine the level of horror this film must have been intended to create.",

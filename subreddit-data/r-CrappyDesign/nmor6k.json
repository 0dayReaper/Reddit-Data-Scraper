To my recollection, you enter ZIP code and then street number plus name. So like \"12345\", \"1400\", \"E Pennsylvania Ave\" and as you type the street name, it displays a list of all possible completions including city/state\n\nSo, if you have a database, I guess my advice is - use ZIP code, street number, and street name, and rely on the USPS and some fuzzy search to turn a city and state name into a match?\n\niunno lol",

So, if we got a fire or medical call in there, the address would come up as Pleasant Town TP, 456 s Main St Unit #234, and our mapping program would flag that particular lot.\n\nBasically the street names are just a cute little deal for the residents and don't mean anything beyond that.",

Continue another two blocks and it's now Bagley Avenue.\n\n\nBut don't worry, Google Maps will helpfully tell you to CONTINUE STRAIGHT CONTINUE STRAIGHT CONTINUE STRAIGHT CONTINUE STRAIGHT CONTINUE STRAIGHT CONTINUE STRAIGHT CONTINUE STRAIGHT every fucking time the roads change names.\n\n\nI hate Minnesota",

Unfortunately my work truck is a Chevy so I have to use it there.\n\nMaps really needs a \"just tone\" option like Ford's when giving directions.

Everything is fine and dandy, then you get a developer wanting to make a suburb. Well, suburb road planning doesn't work because you have closed communities that aren't \"part of the rest of the city\" so now you got  circular and crescent roads meandering all over the place so you gotta name them as such. Often unique because the developer needs to distinguish their area from the rest.\n\nBut you still got this grid system, and wtf are these communities doing so best we do is try to accommodate them. Cities and towns build outwards and those grid systems are still in effect and this not-suburb isn't part now of our plan, so let's wrap the grid system around them. So this part is now 92nd 2-a st and on the left is 236 Belaire Crescent just off Belaire RD but actually in the residential area of Vista (which Vista BLVD doesn't feed)",

For example, there's only one 3248, 3249, 3250, 3251, 3252, 3253, 3254, and 3255 per street number (there's one of each on 89th roads, 90th, 91st, 92nd, and 93rd). So the mail just needs to be sorted by street number, then it gets sorted into the corresponding house number in the block of boxes for that street.",

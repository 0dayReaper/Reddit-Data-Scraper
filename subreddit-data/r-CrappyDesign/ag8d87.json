My locker was at one leg of the shoe, directly outside the classroom I was in, and the next class at the other leg. One day I was walking the obviously smarter and shorter route outside, out one end of the shoe and back in the other, and I was stopped and punished because we weren't allowed for any reason to exit the building during school hours.\n\nDuring lunch, which was broken into several periods, they blocked the long hallway passing the cafeteria to keep lunch period students confined to that area, which also kept students from going through there on their way to class.\n\nSo we weren't allowed to carry bags, and we had to travel the long way around this two-story horseshoe from one class, to our lockers, and to the next class in a few minutes\n\nWe had a rule that several late arrivals counted as an absence, and absences had to be made up on Saturdays. I spent many Saturdays in school.",

All bags must be clear/see through, shirts must be collared and solid, no designs or stripes, shirts must be tucked in, certain colors of clothing at banned due to \"gang affiliation\", and no unnatural hair colors, I'm sure there's more restrictions but I cant think of more right now. It's only been about 15 years, and all these rules are weird. Maybe it does work? I do not know. It just mildly irks me how much it has changed.",

The student body was getting a little big for the school building\u2019s britches and their reasoning was that it creates extra congestion in the hallways during class change. They weren\u2019t wrong, but the district needed a new school and they tried to put that off at our inconvenience. \n\nIt had too many unintended consequences though and they ended up abandoning it. For instance, half the kids never used their lockers and all the sudden had to start. This in turn made overall tardiness go through the roof as the previous 3.5 minutes between class no longer cut it. They upped it to 5 minutes and then the parents started complaining because it added a few minutes to the end of the day and started messing with people\u2019s schedules. \n\nI\u2019ve kept up all this years since and it always seems to be something when it comes to backpacks. My personal least favorite is the clear backpack thing. Ultra-stupid and extra-ugly. ",

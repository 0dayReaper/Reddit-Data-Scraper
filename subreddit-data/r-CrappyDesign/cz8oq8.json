I've had it happen so many times where guys on site make a hasty decisions (which I understand, we all have to make the deadline and I know that architects slow down the process) but then later on down the road it affects the finished look or even in certain cases it can affect something big like clearance for mechanical equipment. \n\nAlso, if the job is done poorly enough, we can just tell the guy who fucked up to take his work down and do it again. That's not ever fun, and causes a ton of issues with the client, but if it's bad enough that the issue is compounding then it's better just to get it sorted.",

I've been in trades for 24 years and run my own commercial framing business now. The only time I've ever seen an architect or engineer called onto site for an issue, it cost a minimum $500 for an hour and he resolved nothing. It all looks great and works on a two dimensional piece of paper, but doesn't work at all in practical application. NEVER have I seen anyone responsible for design take responsibility or offer a legitimately fast and cheap fix. It's always me fixing their issues and never getting compensated for it. My skills at problem solving do result in my getting hired repeatedly, but that's it. I really don't mean to be insulting, I have worked with some talented individuals, but they are incredibly few and far between.",

I'm assuming that the railing and stairs are square, meaning that pillar/column, whatever, is leaning at a pretty aggressive angle. I'm hoping that it's an architectural thing, because otherwise, shits got bigger problems than drywall.\n\nI'm actually not guessing that either the fabricator fucked up his math on the stairs, or it's installed off spec. And is probably supposed to be 12\" from that wall",

According to my Prof during our Structural Design class they said that the Colleges in the provinces received a bunch of funding to create a super cool building that can wow the press. \n\nThe designers went all out on this building to impress the community (And waste their budget in the process). To enter the wing you'd have to pass an L shaped hallway (That bends in a 30 degree angle) that elevates upwards by a 3% grade. This walkway is only 2~m (For a College of 3000~)  apart and has custom made Steel beams that encase the structure for its **3m high, single floor walkway**. \n\nExiting the tunnel leads you to a landing, 4m sticking out leading to similar, 2m wide staircase going down and a encircling hallway to maximize space in this square building. Rooms themselves are filled with your standard computers but the overall layout forces some wacky maneuvering within them for students and teachers alike.\n\nOn the opposite side the the L tunnel houses this Spiral staircase. Itself is made with custom wrought iron and coated with **$25,000 worth of lacquer, layered upon each other**. When it was dropped down the designers underestimated the amount of space between the stair and the main beams (Which is custom made as well).\n\nTo top it off all the structural elements in the building were all custom made, shaped in misformed rectangles and parallelograms. The end result was something to behold, but the skewed shape of the building caused for horrible interior work.",

I think that they had 2/4 or 1/2 of that pillar drywalled,  then stopped to custom make some plywood for the railing installation to retrofit them for the future drywall. Then when the drywall was layed the same thing happened again where they drilled custom holes so that the railing would fit into the pillar. Then before the mudding they put drywall tape around the bars to make it have a cleaner look when it was mudded. \n\nLooking at the underside of the handrail, I see some parts cracking. This means that they didn't install any drywall over the hole before they mudded and put paper on the gaps between the sheets, so the mud started cracking. Over time drywall mud gets brittle and can crack.\n\nThis is strange given how accurate the concrete pillar in the background is.",

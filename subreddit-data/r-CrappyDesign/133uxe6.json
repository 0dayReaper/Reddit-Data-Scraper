My understanding was that the 5 gallon jug was a 5 gallon jug and op used the qualifier of \u201cbig\u201d. The next person makes the joke that it was a big 5 gallon jug as apposed to those little 5 gallon jugs. The joke is no matter what qualifier you use it is still 5 gallons so it was funny to me. So I made the comment that the mini 5 gallons were all I could drink. Funny because it\u2019s still 5 gallons no matter what. \n\nThen you comment about volume or weight and I thought you were taking it all seriously. Im like, this guy actually thought we were saying that 5 gallon jugs are different sizes. And in the course of typing up all of this I realize how dumb all of this is. Have a good Sunday.",

So I grabbed a paper cup and pressed the one in the center.\n\nHot steamy water started to fill the paper cup, and my hand was burning. Scared, and full of anxiety that everyone in the room could see what I was doing, I quickly took the cup of scalding water and hurried to my seat. \n\nThe paper cup was starting to leak a bit, so I did what I had to do. I downed the scalding water. My teeth, tongue, and throat burned like Satans shit after Taco Bell. I could feel the flowing heat throughout my throat and stomach.\n\nI was in a lot of pain, my eyes began to get teary, and I began to panic. I was covered in sweat, and moments later they called my name. I took the drug test, and then hurried back to my car and cried because of how intense the pain was from water. \n\nI thought back to that specific water cooler, there were only paper cups. No coffee related stuff nearby. So why the fuck did they even have hot water as an option? \n\nI may never know, but at least now I know what scalding water taste like.",

They were in a church in a nightmare featuring sprinter zombies. \n\nI had zombie dreams for years after watching Dawn Of the Dead. Sometimes the world was just beginning to end as the shit was on its initial approach toward the proverbial fan and sometimes I would dream that the world had been over for a couple of years. Sometimes it was slow, shambling zombies, sometimes it was sprinters and sometimes everyone was just gone.\n\nIn the dream where I saw these steps, me and my husband had my daughter and one of her little friends from the neighborhood. We had had to grab them and run for it and we ran into this church. These stairs lead up to a second floor where there was a large kitchen with another staircase on the far end. The little steps on the right in this picture led to a small study for the preacher/pastor/minister. \n\nWe ran up there, saw that it wasn\u2019t going to be a safe spot to stay for long and were trying to figure out what the fuck we were going to do when I woke up.",

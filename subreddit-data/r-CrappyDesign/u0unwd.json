They are on TV making your girlfriend feel inadequate. They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you.\n\nYou, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity.\n\nFuck that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It\u2019s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head.\n\nYou owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don\u2019t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don\u2019t even start asking for theirs.\n\n-Banksy",

That's 12,500 + 100,000 for the crane. Not \"a few million\". And in reality the crane rental would be more like 10k, so actually 22,500",

For example, in the field of ecology, it\u2019s been found that light pollution can alter the behavior of certain animals. One observation is that historically diurnal animals (animals that conduct most their activities during the day) are now also fairly active at night and are now preying on nocturnal animals that haven\u2019t evolved to develop defensive mechanisms outside of darkness, since there was never a benefit to it in the past. \n\nEcosystems can be really fragile and damages are hard to reverse. There are people out there trying to find ways to fix the issues of light pollution, which can expand to benefit us in the long run with even small things like being able to see stars in the night sky again. At the end of the day though, it\u2019s up to our government and the people we elect to make effective changes.",

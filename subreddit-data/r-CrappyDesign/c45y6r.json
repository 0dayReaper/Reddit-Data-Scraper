Everyone has eaten mangos with the peel and all. But not all mangos have a tasty peel. Mangos \"Criollos\", Manila and Para\u00edso have a quite good tasting skin. But Ataulfo and Petacon have a skin that's tough and quite bitter. \n\nEating Mangos with the skin and all is probably the cleanest way of eating a mango and you get more vitamins, fiber and nucleic acids out of it. Plus you generate less trash. Some hot sauce and salt can get rid of that \"bitter\" taste",

I work at a large grocery store where most of our customers hate when things come in plastic packaging. Our store tends to attract a more conscious or caring type of person. Like shopping for organics, non-gmo, no artificial additives, and 100% recyclable packaging if it must be packaged. They usually won't even buy something if it's in plastic, they'd rather find it elsewhere where it can be purchased with less or no packaging. This is a trend that's favored throughout all of our stores and they go out for thier way to minimize packaging or make sure it is entirely recyclable.",

So the businesses that are skilled at catering to their customer's desires make more money by doing this.  Presentation, especially in Asian countries is very important.  This focus on presentation has been exported to the West; a good example is how high gadgets and other high end items are packaged along with the ritual of unboxing.\n\nThe bad news is that the problem is that it gets worse than what is shown here.  It is common practice in China for even bulk purchases to be individually bagged into thick plastic bags.  For example if you go to the bakery to buy 12 rolls, each roll will be put into thick, oversized bag which are then put into an even larger bag for keeping the smaller bags together.  And the plastic is much thicker than what the US or Europe uses.    So some Asian consumers are using many times more plastic than their Western counterpart, but not out of utility, out of luxury. \n\nThe good news is the consumers are not very aware of the ecological implications.  Once educated on the issues, consumers in the East are generally very willing to change their buying habits.  More willing to change their behavior than their Western counterparts.\n\n The majority of this plastic still is not recycled.",

Even a 100 years ago people would still try and choose the best quality vegetables and fruits to buy. But over the years the base quality has gotten higher and higher, yet of course people still want the most \"bang for their buck\" and thus still choose the best-looking and freshest produce. And because those sell the best, stores keep improving the base quality. So this process just keeps on going forever, basically.\n\nHonestly I'm not really sure what a solution would be to this problem besides a huge campaign to make the public lower their standards.",

If I'm looking at a stack of mangoes that are two dollars each, I'm going to get the best mangos I can get for those two dollars. But of you have some mangoes that are ok next to the nice mangoes and they are only one dollar, I'll make sacrifice for the savings. I don't think you'll ever convince a consumer to deliberately choose a lower quality product for something you can get in a higher quality for the exact same price and I would question that consumer's intelligence if you did.",

Poor nations are the victims you see and western rich powers the oppressors - under that worldview the victim can do nothing wrong, and their actual wrongdoing will be applied to the \"opressor\" class.\n\nIt's just modern collectivist thinking, and I can imagine an ideologue justifying poor countries destroying the ocean along the lanes of \"they only do it because of the history of colonization that their nations went through\"! - Or: They only do it because first world countries ship their trash there. Or: They only are doing it because first world countries are oppressing them by buying their goods, which produces waste.\n\nNow the first argument I haven't actually heard, but the second two are real. It's just how cognitive dissonance sounds like.\n\nFor more on this I recommend watching Jonathan Haidt: https://youtu.be/Gatn5ameRr8",

Just like you'd usually pick the biggest one if they're sold by unit rather than weight. (Ignoring the fact that big may mean watery.) And if there's only bruised or small fruit left, it makes sense that people would wait for a restock where they get fresher and better looking fruit for the same price, which unfortunately means that food will land in a dumpster. It's only natural though, really. Discounts for \"blemished\" produce and \"expired\" food would do quite a lot to reduce the amount of food waste.",

It's possible they do it by machine but I find it unlikely since that would subject their precious perfect apples to bruising.\n\nSecond, it meant somewhere else was pumping out these formed apple packages with all of the associated impacts.\n\nThird, it meant people were buying them and dealing with the waste.",

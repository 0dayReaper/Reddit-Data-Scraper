The CYL/AXIS is your astigmatism prescription. Astigmatism is essentially when your eye isn't round anymore (think rugby ball shaped) so you end up with two focal points and your eyes take time to focus when changing from long distance focus to short distance. The first part (-1.25) is a similar measurement to your shortsightedness, the second part is the axis that your eyeball is elongated on so your contacts can be made to suit. Your contacts will be \"toric\" which means they are shaped to your eye so they orientate the right way on your eye.\n\nA prescription of 4, even plus 1.25 astigmatism isn't ridiculously high but definitely high enough to affect you day to day! The scale goes to 12 I think; and at 10 (?) you'd be legally blind.\n\nThat's my interpretation from my own prescriptions, I'm by no means an optician!",

This is not a huge billboard by the highway, case in which you actually know what you're buying. This kind of advertisement have a high rotation and more often than not you buy a circuit, not individual places. So you have individual customers that have places where advertisements might be placed, then advertisement companies who reach an agreement with them to place the required infrastructure and commercialize it and either rent the spot for a fixed price or share revenue, then agencies who resell that to their customers (and, often, you have more than one middleman). \n\nSo, often, a company will ask its marketing guy to place a campaign like such and such, who in turn asks a marketing company to handle it, they have their designers create the content, then they offer the customer various circuits in which it can be placed, which in turn they contract from those holding the actual stock. \n\nSo you don't go and place one billboard in that specific place, you buy a circuit for a certain time. So you pay to have your ad placed in 100 places, and a bunch of people are involved. \n\nSo, yeah, more often than not you'll see ads in places where they might have some odd connotation. It's not such a big deal, and it's not as if someone went and intentionally put it there. ",

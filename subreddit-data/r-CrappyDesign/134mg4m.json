You have to be able to turn a wheelchair all the way around inside one of them, and often, that's also the location of the changing table and sometimes of a sink. And they function best with a corner made of wall material instead of thin partition material, so you can get one grab bar at the back and one along the side, capable of supporting a morbidly obese person.\n\nIf you had oodles of spare space, you could get all of that near the entrance to the bathroom and then put all of the smaller stalls behind it, with a lot of wasted circulation space. But then people would have to backtrack further into the bathroom to wash and dry their hands. More importantly, bathrooms are one of the most expensive spaces in the building, because you can't factor that space into the leased area. So the more square footage you give it, the less money you are making per square foot from your building. So nobody is paying for a big spacious bathroom with the largest stall right at the entrance.\n\nI'm not saying it's right, or the way that we currently do things is the only solution. But this is why things are done the way they are done right now. It all comes down to maximizing profits.",

They're very expensive and will get destroyed in the land development process anyway, so we require developers to include sidewalks in their site development plans.\n\nLots of the time, they don't build them, all for a temporary certificate of occupancy, sell the land, dissolve the LLC that didn't finish, and ghost us.\n\nThe new owners cry over being lied to, and it never gets built.\n\nThat's why our city has a policy that all accessibility features on a plot of land be completed before any business is able to open on the site. The developers think they should get a TCO for anything not life/health/safety related, and we have to remind them that handicapped people ARE people and safety includes accessibility.",

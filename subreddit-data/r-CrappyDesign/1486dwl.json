But the Porcelain Throne being other than fully enclosed with a proper door? Never seen in my whole life. Especially given that it's often the only way to get any resemblance of privacy... And housing standards were shit. Like a family of 3 living in a 90 sq ft room or 2 families of 4 (not related) sharing a 1-br apartment of 450 sq ft (with maybe about half of it being actual livable space).\n\nEven in China they'd close it off with a proper door, although some genius designs would put that hole-in-the-floor type of shitter in the sort of a podium in the kitchen (with the shower head above it - drainage is important!). Still there will be proper walls and a door.\n\nSource: Born and raised in the USSR. Lived 20+ years in China.",

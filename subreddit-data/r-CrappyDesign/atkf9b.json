The restraining nature of the outfit also follows with the sense of humour that gvasalia has brung to there modern collections, often taking jabs at the industry (things like visible tags, charging \u00a31000 for paper bags) so the restraining nature could be seen as commentary on the tight restrictions of the industry. Wouldn\u2019t be the first time a designer did this, as McQueen did something similar in the 90s with his la poupee show",

You go to your closet and you select out, oh I don\u2019t know, that lumpy blue sweater, for instance, because you\u2019re trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back. But what you don\u2019t know is that that sweater is not just blue, it\u2019s not turquoise, it\u2019s not lapis, it\u2019s actually cerulean. You\u2019re also blindly unaware of the fact that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns. And then I think it was Yves St Laurent, wasn\u2019t it, who showed cerulean military jackets? And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers. Then it filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic \u201ccasual corner\u201d where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin. However, that blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs and so it\u2019s sort of comical how you think that you\u2019ve made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you\u2019re wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room.

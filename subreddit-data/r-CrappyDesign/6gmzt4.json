Then I'll strut down to the cop shop wearing that shit like a badge of honour.\n\nIn all seriousness, from my perspective this thing is a minor inconvenience at worst, by the time a fire is noticed, every room with an alarm trigger and all paths out are likely not already completely engulfed in flames, and the unlikely scenario that this would somehow cause interference resulting in my death is pretty negligible. Seems like basic civic duty, and I'd hope that if roles were reversed, others would do the same to help me.\n\nPlus, I'm pretty fond of most of you folks :)\n\nEdit: Typo. also a few other commenters have pointed out that these alarms wouldn't even be inside the burning building, but on a nearby street corner.",

Typically installed on street corners, they were the main means of summoning firefighters before the general availability of telephones.\n\nWhen the box is activated by turning a knob or pulling a hook, a spring-loaded wheel turns, tapping out a pulsed electrical signal corresponding to the box's number. A receiver at fire headquarters annunciates the pulses through flashing lights or tones, or via a pen recorder, and the box number is matched to a list of box locations. In modern installations a computer receives and translates the pulses; in unmanned installations in small communities, the box number may be sounded out by a horn or bell audible community-wide.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.2",

It was a box of numbered bells, and each bell number corresponded to one of these boxes around the city. When the alarm went off, firefighters could see which bell was ringing to know what street to go to without actually talking to the person placing the call. ",

Eventually they actually stopped us from going out and told us to just get on with the day which obviously pissed off the people who wanted to disrupt lessons. So the next time they actually started a fire. ",

They were filled with some sort of blue market dye, so if you pulled it your hand would be stained blue. The stuff was evident on the poles of the few that had been pulled. Though Snopes and some other sites claim these don't exist, they certainly did on the west coast of the US in the 1970s. Seems a much better approach than a handcuff.",

There is no snopes page on the fire alarm ink.\n\nYou may be right-- I was citing second hand info on Snopes. [This is the only link](http://msgboard.snopes.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=89;t=000836;p=1) I can find there on the ink.\n\nEdit: there [is actually one more snopes link](http://www.snopes.com/science/poolpiss.asp) about this ink, buried in the pool piss story. They claim there *is* such ink, but that it's a new thing. \"new\" since the early 1970s perhaps.",

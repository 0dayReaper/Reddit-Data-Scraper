He wants his engineers to make a lemon grenade, or, for short, a \"lemon-nade\".",

First, the military only typically maintains 1 kind of sidearm in its inventory. The M18 is easier to shoot for a small person than the M9 was.  The M9 was where I encountered most women who had such issues. \n\nSecond,  giving a weak person a smaller firearm doesn't address the fundamental problem of the person being too weak. That lack of strength also means they can't hold proper form for very long,  if at all, among a giant list of other problems for someone that weak. \n\nDads, if you have any inkling your daughter might have interest in the military put her in sports, preferably something that requires strength, like wrestling. The number of failures and injuries I've seen from lack of strength is unacceptable.",

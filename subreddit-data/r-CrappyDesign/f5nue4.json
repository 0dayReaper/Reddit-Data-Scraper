It's also an environmental concern that you cannot turn off the engine at long stops.\n\nI'm usually not one for unnecessary business regulation, but some tech companies sure are just *begging* for regulation with their insane behavior.",

Improving the vehicle lifespan significantly is achieved by properly servicing the engine every few thousands kilometers by a professionals car mechanics. Short distances driving can reduce the vehicle lifespan, that's still true but it's not a major cause that you want to put a limit on. The same as resting your hand on the gear knob can cause excessive wear on the transmission, it's not the major cause of broken transmission, should we also apply small electric shocker to gear knob to prevent this?",

Unfortunately it will take someone dying in their rental car when it gets stuck in the mountains during winter because they reached their alotted restarts or couldn't find signal. \n\nIt's lucky they were in mild weather. What if these people were in the middle of a snow storm? What if it stopped in the desert with no water? What if they had kids with them? Being able to remotely strand* someone is incredibly dangerous.",

Not even any ticket or anything, just impounded by the tow company.  (BS, but I fucked up, not the issue here).\n\nTow company needs a release from the police.  Police need proof of ownership, or a copy of the rental agreement.  The rental agreement is in the hotel room, a 30 minute drive away.    The police station was like 6 blocks from work, and the tow lot a block away.  Cheap Uber to the police station then walk to the tow lot, stopping for the impound fee from an ATM in between.\n\nIt was like 1 AM, so I worked out my 8 hours and called the rental place when they opened to see if they could fax a copy to the office.  They basically said no, and they would have to send it up the chain to get the car back.  They said the police wouldn't accept a rental agreement for release (I literally talked to the nice cop lady in traffic over the phone who said they would).\n\nI ended up borrowing a company vehicle and drove all the way to the hotel, then all the way back to work, then had a coworker give me a lift to the police station.  Wasted like 2 hours back and forth and around because they couldn't be added to fax me a copy of the rental agreement.",

Which is dumb because I've driven my friend's car with the fob in *his* pocket and him not physically inside the vehicle. I could drive as long as I had fuel. Which, on a full tank is like ~400 miles.\n\nThe car should shut off if the fob is not detectable for a set interval (say, 2 minutes) imho. I'm sure there's reasons they're programmed the way they are and I'm also sure they're money based.\n\nEdit: Since people are misunderstanding. The check is a single check, two minutes after starting the vehicle. If the fob is absent it would wait until the vehicle is stopped, then turn the car off. I highly doubt your fob will die in the 2 minutes before the check, and *if it does* you're not that far from where you started. Turning off the vehicle while it's in motion is a damn class action lawsuit begging to be made.",

A rental I drove had a fob and my coworker left with it to go grab snacks. I waited in the car. It dinged and said the key had left but kept running. That's a good design to me.

Because then the trip is ended and it won't let you restart the vehicle.\n\nIt also says this on their site if you google it: \n\nhttps://gigcarshare.com/blog/pro-tip-use-bluetooth-to-lockunlock-your-gig-car-in-low-cell-service-areas/\n\n&gt; If you\u2019re heading to an area where you know the cell reception will be poor, be sure to turn on Bluetooth before you get there. You can do it in the middle of your reservation if needed, but it\u2019s always the safe bet to start out your trip with a Bluetooth connection if possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gig uses low-energy Bluetooth, so it uses less of your phone\u2019s battery power and don\u2019t worry \u2013 you can still use all your other Bluetooth accessories alongside the Gig app.\n\nI'm going to guess they'll pull a \"sorry but we told you\"",

To elaborate, the frame of the building itself is basically a copy pasta of one specific building design a team of architects and engineers made as a \"master copy\".  The foundation, load-bearing supports, HVAC, windows, doors and bathrooms are all preplaced, but the majority of the building is empty. To save costs, contractors usually have their client select a prefab template, and either them or someone we subcontract having them essentially \"draw\" what they want the floor plan to look like. What's happening here is one of these walls that were drawn in went over the window, effectively slicing a bit off. Things like this sometime slip through the cracks, and when the walls are being put up, the workers just follow the floor plan and build, not asking questions for stuff like this.  And fun fact, you can gets blinds in pretty much any size you want. The top part of the blinds are made in giant lengths, called stocks. You can cut the stock to any length you want and then put the 2 drawstrings on, and I made all of this up I have no idea what I'm talking about. ",

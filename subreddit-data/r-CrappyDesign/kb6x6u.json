There are small differences from on retaielr to another. in this specific case:\n\nthe first big black number on the left says youre buying 0.158KG of cheese (or 158grams)\n\nthe second big black number to the right says the total price which is $13161 pesos (colombian pesos, thats roughly $3.50 USD)\n\non smaller letters down below where it says \"F. Empaque\" it means the date in which it was packaged (im assuming this picture is a bit old or otherwise mold would actually be real lol)\n\nthen just below it says \"precio/kg\" which is price per KG, which is $83300 pesos (or something around $25 USD per kilogram of Tilsit Cheese",

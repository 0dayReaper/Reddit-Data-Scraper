If you can't wait around then request that they give the key to security so you can come back and retrieve it later.  \n\nIf you're in a commercial building as a visitor , likely they will swallow the cost (~150-250). If you are a commercial tenant or resident , you may eventually get billed for it.  \n\nSauce: used to be security supervisor for large building.   Residents dropping stuff down the elevator shaft happened at least once per month. ",

And I dont exactly recall the segment or why he decided to play this, but it was basically \"listen to what those crazy fuckers down in Germany have on their hit list\" or whatever and then he played it. And then it became like a running gag. And eventually it became a hit single here as well and a radio hit on several channels. The world is strange sometimes. If I remember correctly, when it was certified gold here, the record company actually gave the gold disc to Sagen.",

It took me, my (livid) brother and the bartender 30 min but we managed to use some paracord with a magnet on the end. The keys weren't magnetic but thank christ the swiss army knife was. There were like two people in the bar (it was like 1 pm) but they both we pissing themselves laughing. Luckily the bar was just a surface in the front of a brewery so the bartender ( brew guy as well i guess) had hardware everywhere and luckily there was a magnet and cord. Also for the record, we weren't drinking and driving, there was a pop-up fried chicken stand we went to for lunch in the back of the brewery.",

The whole reason for Arial's existence was that Linotype licensed Helvetica for Xerox and Apple but not for IBM, so IBM had to pay ridiculous fees to include Helvetica in their printers (back in the day, printers had to have the code for the font in order to print it correctly).\n\nIBM then paid Monotype (Linotype's main competitor back then) for a new font that had *exactly* the same dimensions as Helvetica, so it could replace it and still print correctly.\n\nToday Monotype and Linotype are the same company, but Helvetica is still a standard font on Mac and Arial on Windows.",

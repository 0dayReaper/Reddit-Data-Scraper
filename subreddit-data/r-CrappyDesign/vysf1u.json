They gathered intelligence on human workplace culture. They tailored human-looking clothes to fit a bear. They modified a car for a bear to drive to and from the office.\n\nA bear is trained to talk. Write. Use a computer and cellphone. Operate common office equipment. Drive. Socialize with humans.\n\nAfter years of climbing the corporate ladder, the bear is finally put in charge of a small project. It is successful, and the bear is trusted with other projects. Eventually, success! A trash can project for a national park!\n\nThis is not crappy design. We are seeing the results a pivotal moment in the history of bearkind.",

The snug fit, plus the weight of the can leaning against the inside of the frame gives it quite a lot of resistance. The lid has only its own weight. When I was young kids used to kick the frame from underneath to make the can fall down deliberately. So in that sense it's a bad design, since it's not delinquent safe :P But a reasonably gifted human can open this lid just fine.",

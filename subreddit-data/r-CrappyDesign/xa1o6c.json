Wait until it\u2019s orange and flashing fast, which indicates it\u2019s doing a factory reset.\n* If it\u2019s red and flashing according to the pattern   - - -   \u2014 \u2014 \u2014   - - -, it\u2019s sending an SOS signal and is about to self explode.",

My pet peeve and worst offender is... our baby cam. Of course it has a fairly bright blue LED. Guess when it goes on? That's right, anytime you turn on the camera from the app! Because why not blast that poor baby's tired eyes with a bright blinking blue light, in the middle of the night when they need all the help to stay asleep. \n\n\nThe cam itself works great so we can't bring ourselves to buy another one just because of the stupid light. We just taped it off as best as we could.  But seriously, nobody at Motorola questioned having a blue light on an item specifically designed to be used at night?",

They came in the standard 5mm size and were US$9.97 a pop. *For just one LED*. Now you could buy a pack of 100 blue LEDs for around the same price.\n\nNeedless to say I bought a few because I was a teenager with disposable income, and was also a nerd and thought the concept of blue LEDs was so cool considering that LEDs at the time mostly came in green, yellow, orange and red (oh, and infrared).",

All diodes are LEDs, but getting the wavelength short enough for blue was much more difficult than red and green.\n\nEDIT: Based on some replies I'd like to clear one thing up. All diodes emit light when there is a current flowing through them. The device we usually call an LED has a clear case and targets a particular wavelength/color, but we have infrared LEDs and ultraviolet LEDs just the same.",

For most devices like this with LED signals, they'll stick a tiny processor inside of it for things like turning LEDs on or off, or making them blink. My guess is that they just have a red LED attached directly to the charger. If it's charging then the LED will have a lot of current and show a bright red. When it's fully charged the current will drop and the LED will dim (which I think is what they mean by \"Slight Red\"). If the battery is low then the voltage will decrease, which will cause the color to shift to orange.\n\nThis way they can save costs, while still *technically* having different colors for different power states. I'm not an electrical engineer though so someone correct me if this explanation is inaccurate.",

Red green colorblindness is the most common by far, and yet somehow red green has become the standard for fucking any type of mode indicator. \n\nI really hate it. My colorblindness isn't exactly a disability. I don't ask for a lot in terms of accommodation. Being able to tell whether my batteries are charged is basically all I want.",

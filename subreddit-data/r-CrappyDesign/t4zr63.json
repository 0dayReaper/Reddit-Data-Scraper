(Weird to say with the movie actor in my head, but that's what the book says.) Still weird that he gets obsessed with a high schooler though.\n\nIf What We Do In The Shadows is anything to go by, maybe vampires also stop emotionally maturing?",

Well, her and the vampire have a baby. Werewolf guy, when meeting the kid, \"imprints\" (I'm pretty sure that's the term my old gf used) on her, basically like he falls deeply in love with this baby (someone correct me if I'm way off here) and it's just supposed to be ok that the main character's former love interest is now grooming her child.\n\nEdit: Holeeee sheeeet. Ok so I did some googling because I was doubting that I had the details right. This is so messed up. Check the first comment on this reddit thread. https://www.reddit.com/r/twilight/comments/9ipjjf/just_finished_watching_bd_part_2_and_have_a_huge/\n\nSo apparently I'm not the only one that views it as clearly grooming, and the OP of that link does a much better job explaining the characters and why it's grooming. That top comment though, \n\n\"You talk like Jacob had a choice in the matter. He literally walked into the room and his werewolf blood imprinted on Renesmee. He wasn't some sicko who was attracted to babies, it can't even be controlled...\"\n\nHow does this not get more shit?",

So they go to high school in order to stay in one place a few years longer than they would pretending to be in university/college.\n\nThe werewolf stuff is kind of gross and definitely meant to handwave how it's okay when it's really not. They imprint on someone who is essentially destined to be their soulmate. If one of them is really young, the relationship stays age appropriate until they are both old enough. So it goes like favourite uncle &gt; best friend &gt; romantic. Breaking Dawn even went so far as to say that Jacob was only \"in love\" with Bella because he was actually destined to be with her future daughter. I hate that book.\n\nVampires have a similar thing to imprinting just in that they are unchanging immortal beings so when they find love, they feel it as a deep permanent part of themselves that reshapes their world. Way less ick.",

It was the worst movie experience ive ever had every time we went, and got worse as the hype increased around the series.\n\nIt was just girls literally screaming everytime Jacob took his shirt off or anytime anything significant happened lmao - I couldn't even try get into the movie because you couldn't hear the dialouge due to the screaming, i actually tried to like them since i was forced to go anyway. I couldn't believe the behavior as someone who grew up with strict parents, how could you scream at the movies?\n\nThis post reminded me how much I hated those days. All of those movies are so bad and Bella was so annoying, just her face irks me now. The only redeeming part was the end fight in the last one with the surprise twist with the short haired girl vampire's eyes. And that peaked at \"oh that was kinda cool\" and then it was just more girls screaming and Bella being cringy and cardboard. I thought Edward was a good actor, but that has nothing to do with the story itself.\n\nMan I really hated those days, I'm so glad it's over. Those movies are the worst. Sorry for the rant this just brought me back and I needed to vent lol. Horrible experience that I knew was coming everytime a new movie dropped",

I get that Jacob's imprint isn't meant to be creepy when she's a baby, he just loves her as you would your own child etc. But when does it become appropriate? She ages super fast &amp; idk, what happens when she hits 15 &amp; maybe wants to have sex. Is Jacob gonna be creeping around in the background getting mad over her potential love interests, like he did with Bella? She'll be like 15 and he'll be perpetually 25 standing behind her glaring. I guess he'll just wait a week until she's 25 too? \ud83e\udd22\n\nThere's a chick who is with one of the other werewolves &amp; I remember there being a really weird line in there about how she didn't like that guy, Sam I think, at first, but that that amount of love was hard to turn down or something? I'll update with a quote later if I can find it but I got the sense he \"wore her down\" \ud83e\udd2e. I might be way off on what I remember though, it's been awhile",

She think that it has romantic and things like him breaking into her room to watch her sleeping has the ultimate form of romance.\n\nThe entire series has a giant toxic relationship with red flag after red flag being sung as the best type of romance. And that is not going into Jacob that has a good character in the second book, and the fact that people liked his romance with the mc more than the vampire one pissed off the author and she used the third book to destroy him, and then he end the series marking the recently born child to be his wife, another thing show as \"romantic\"\n\nTL;DR - the author needs therapy",

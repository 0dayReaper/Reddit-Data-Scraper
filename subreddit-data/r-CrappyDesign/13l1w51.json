My dad trained dogs for some law enforcement departments and worked with the local sheriff who was also a close friend. He always kept an eye on my mom even after they divorced so he would be told about anything going on around her.\n\nI\u2019m visiting from out of state, and my aunt comes over. We\u2019re sitting down having lunch when we heard gun shots. We go to the porch and see this guy running across the road clutching his bleeding abdomen. \n\nI run to get clean towels and made sure to get the old ones my mom used for her dogs. I also grabbed my mom\u2019s  .38. The victim is in the yard across the little street in my mom\u2019s neighborhood. He\u2019s trying to hide amongst the construction work. He comes towards me to get the towels and says I need to get inside because he thought the shooter would come looking.\n\nI\u2019m halfway across the street when a truck pulls up, and the victim says it\u2019s him. I turn so the shooter can see my pistol. He backed out onto the road and left. I told the victim that we\u2019d called the cops and ambulance already. He thanked me for the towels. \n\nI couldn\u2019t stand by and watch him bleed out or get shot again. Anyone who would do that in broad daylight would probably shoot witnesses. \n\nIf I\u2019d grabbed the good towels, I would be wishing the shooter shot me. My mom would not have been happy. I was willing to buy her new towels.",

And I'm no, I did not and then she was like then why is there semen on my towels. \n\nAnd I said oh it must have (person) because he went into the bathroom for a long time. It wasn't me.\n\nNeedless to say when I saw him again at his cousin's house. (We all lived in the neighborhood that had just been built)\n\nHe looked at me like oh fuck. \n\nHe never came over again. And I saw him a handful of times before him and his mother moved. Then when the Mayweather Pacquiao fight. His cousin my Best friend, asked if he could come over. I said yeah. Was very nice, great night. (Helper the complex my ex and I were renting from gave out free alcohol) \n\nBut fuck my mom was fucking fumning before believing me.",

The towel slides over the bar with the decorative side on top and the other half on the back. The towels will still look pristine when you use the back part. No upset hosts and no wet clothes from having to wipe your hands on your clothes. \n\nI\u2019m a 45 year old woman who has never had unusable towels in any of my bathrooms. You can buy really pretty normal towels that you can actually use.",

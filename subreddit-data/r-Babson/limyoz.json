From the outside point of view, there is no logical reason why you get the highest merit-based scholarship at a top 20 ranking college, but no scholarship at all from a college ranking over 100. \n\nWashington University in St. Louis even notifies the awarded applicants before everyone else gets there acceptance decisions.\n\nEvery college is different. IMO this forces students to apply to as many fitting colleges as possible; something that does not really help relieving pressure off the college application process.",

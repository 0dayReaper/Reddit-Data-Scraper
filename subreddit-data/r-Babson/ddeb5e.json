    "postText": "I really love Babson and would appreciate if students could answer a couple of my questions!\n\n- What is the social life like? \n\n- Do people party in Dorms, Frat houses, Boston or in Wellesley? \n\n- How often do people go into Boston?\n\n- Is Babson more Liberal or Conservative?\n\n- Are the Professors good? (I\u2019ve headed mixed things about them) \n\n- Does Babson give Merit Scholarships? \n\n- Is Babson good for other Business majors than entrepreneurship? \n\n\nIf multiple students could reply that would be great so I can get different perspectives!",

            "comment": "Your social life largely depends on which groups you are a part of, sports team, frat, etc. \n\nPeople party in the dorms/frat towers or Boston. \n\nI only visited Boston a few times a semester, others might be there every weekend. It\u2019s easy enough to get to if you want to spend time there. \n\nThe campus is probably less liberal than your average college, but still pretty liberal. \n\nI had more good professors than bad. I think the advantage here is you get lots of professors with actual real world experience rather than purely academic backgrounds. \n\nI don\u2019t remember the specifics on scholarships. I would check with admissions. \n\nMost people do not end up pursuing entrepreneurship. There is lots of accounting/finance. If you have a specific career path in mind, I can give you a better understanding of job outcomes.",

            "comment": "1. Social life actually depends on who you vibe with and who vibes with you. I would say there are three easy markers. International students, fraternities/sororities, sports teams. After that people hang out with whoever they like that likes them back. Also, people do speak to the three groups above, and can be friends with them. But I would say that in my experience, I've seen more friendships spring among people who talk to international students and students in Greek life. People do talk to students in sports teams, but it tends to be more on a surface level instead of a friendship level.\n2. They party at a mix of all those places. It depends on who you are, and who your friends are. What I would say is that if you're looking to get out into Boston/Wellesley or wherever you need a car. If you do not have a car, you will be stranded on campus each weekend, unless you have the money to Uber everywhere, all the time.\n3. Again, it depends on the friend group, and also if you have a car or are willing to pay a minimum $30 one way to Boston/Cambridge.\n4. I honestly haven't spoken to people about politics much so I don't know.\n5. It depends on your interests and what you like in a class. Professors know their stuff, it's how they communicate it that really depends on the person.\n6. Babson does five merit scholarships. Go on their website under scholarships and you'll see what they offer. If you have more questions about specific scholarships, call or e-mail financial services. They're really kind.\n7. Babson has a lot of people concentrating in Business Analytics, Accounting, and Finance. If you like these fields, it's a decent college to go to. Also, the majority of people here do not become entrepreneurs. Babson's dedication to entrepreneurship is entrepreneurial *thinking* not being a business owner. There are people who apply entrepreneurial thinking to becoming business owners, but Babson teaches you how to think like an entrepreneur in the role of a project manager, consultant, business analyst, etc. and if you want as a business owner. If you want to run your own business, and want a community to support you, the Blank Center for Entrepreneurship and the Weissman Foundry have amazing support. You could also get involved with E-tower, and network, as well as make friends with people who can support you in that capacity.",

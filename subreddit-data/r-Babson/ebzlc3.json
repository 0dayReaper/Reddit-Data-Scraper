I hope most of you get into Babson ED, including me lol and for those who don't read below.\nI know it's been up and down and things might have been difficult lately and I'm sorry about that. Well take it from me, if anyone's destined for greatness, it's you. You owe your gifts to the world. I'm sending a boost of positivity. Hope you know that whatever it is, you face with whatever adversity you're facing, there is nothing you can't conquer and get passed. I know it's been tough but you're stronger than you ever know :)\nSending loads of love and positivity and I also hope that wherever you are the sun may always shine on you, you stay positive in your mind and in your body. \nps: listen to \"now my feet won't touch the ground\" and \"champion of the world\" by Coldplay. You'll love them!\nDrop a comment or PM me if you wanna talk about anything?",

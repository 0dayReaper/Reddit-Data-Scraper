    "postText": "Hello! I applied as a transfer to Babson for the coming fall semester and was wondering if anyone had anything a little more specific regarding the notification date. I was accepted into the Binghamton SOM and was only able to get them to extend the enrollment date to May 7th for me and I want to know if I'll hear from Babson before I need to make my enrollment deposit for Bing. Anything helps! Just really stressing.",

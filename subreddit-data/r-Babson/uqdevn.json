    "postText": "Hiiiiii so I got in and previously I was super excited about coming but lately i've been having doubts after hearing about some unhappy Babson students. Could any current students speak about their experiences with the Babson community/social scene, dating scene, the general stress-levels, and how much the small size of the school affects you. Thank you guys so much!!!",

Otherwise it can be a little tough because there are a lot of similar personality types. I had a good dating experience, but others I know struggle, so I can\u2019t say much on that. It\u2019s not that stressful, the learning is great you just have to want it. It\u2019s business so no matter where you go it\u2019ll be competing but focus on yourself and know that other people\u2019s success doesn\u2019t hinder yours and you\u2019ll be fine.",

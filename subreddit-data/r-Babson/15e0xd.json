    "postText": "Hi all--\n\nAs I work full time, I'm looking into Part-Time MBA programs in the Boston area for 2014 when I finish my Master's program in biotechnology. I'm hoping to use the degree to leverage my biotech background into a leadership role at a Boston biotech startup. I've done research on a few area programs (Northeastern, WPI, UMass Amherst, BC, BU, Babson). I've narrowed my target list to two schools, but I'm having a hard time deciding between BU and Babson. Here's the information I've gathered so far:\n\nBabson:\n\n* Program: Fast-Track MBA\n* Theme: Entrepreneurship\n* Cost: ~75k\n* PT Time Commitment: 2 years\n* Rank of FT Program: Top 50\n\nBU:\n\n* Program: Professional Evening MBA\n* Theme: General Management with various concentrations\n* Cost: ~85k\n* PT Time Commitment: ~4 years, depending on aggressiveness of schedule\n* Rank of FT Program: Top 30/40\n\nI wanted to ask and see what the community thought of these two schools and programs and also insight as to how target companies will view each. Basically, I'm asking if the higher prestige/ranking of Boston U. is worth the extra time (and cost). Is Babson even thought of as an elite school outside of the northeast? I'm from the northeast and may have a skewed interpretation.\n\nAny insight would be much appreciated. Thanks!\n",

I work with the directors of the different programs (1 yr, 2 yr, Fast Track, and Evening) and assist them in day to day activities.  If you have any questions you can PM me and I can send you some more specific information.  I can tell you that there are some interesting things that make Babson different from other schools.\n ",

But, as it would appear, a good deal of people who are high up in finance in my area (a way's away) have definitely heard of, and respect, Babson.\n\n",

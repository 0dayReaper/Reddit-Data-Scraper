Personally, I don\u2019t think either are worth the money. MBA is seen as a \u201creset\u201d button by many since it allows professionals to break into prestigious fields like Product management, management consulting, high finance and many others. An MBA from a top institution gives you a brand name, prestige, increases money potential and allows you to switch between careers. MBA is only worth it when: 1. It is considered a top program (as I mentioned before GSB, Booth, Sloan, Kellog, Harvard and etc). 2. You already have at least 5-6 years of professional experience 3. You can afford the tuition and possibly taking a break from your job. So I don\u2019t think Clark and Babson are worth the money. I might be wrong, but Babson is far from being considered a prestigious MBA program let alone Clark Uni MBA. So I would not spend potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars on these programs. Sure they provide job opportunities but don\u2019t expect high regarded roles like MBB or PE.",

Looking forward to transition my role. I was in the understanding that Babson is #1 for the past 29 years in Entrepreneurship, so it would be highly recognized by startup companies in Business development roles and other consulting roles as they teach entrepreneurship at thier core of all the subjects.\nI'm not sure how Impactful that would be on my job, but I thought it's worth the try.\nClark does say it's 97th rank, on a couple of known websites, but again, I'm not relying much on campus interviews. I have a couple of good contacts that can help me out in the H1b process in the states, so considering all these factors, if I need to choose from either of these for now, which one would you recommend me to go for?",

Entrepreneurship cannot be taught, it\u2019s something that you have to learn through practice (doing a startup). So it\u2019s not something that would be well regarded by employers and in my opinion is an irrelevant ranking. If you look at the data of colleges that produce the most entrepreneurs it\u2019s schools like Stanford, MIT, Harvard, Berkeley and etc ([source 1](https://www.crimsoneducation.org/us/blog/campus-life-more/best-schools-for-startup-founders/), [source 2](https://www.businessinsider.com/top-colleges-for-startup-founders-pitchbook-2018-9?amp). These ratings actually have tangible data like capital raised, number of startups and etc. Just because Babson likes to present itself as an entrepreneurial school does not mean it is actually number 1. So again, if you want to get hired at a well paying job in the states after MBA, you will be better off trying your like with admissions at top universities in the next 2-3 years. Again, I do not know your financial situation and such. But both of these universities have questionable ROI. Since you will be on F1, it will be even harder to get hired, you will have more chances if you have a brand name university on your resume. Don\u2019t limit yourself to Babson and Clark.",

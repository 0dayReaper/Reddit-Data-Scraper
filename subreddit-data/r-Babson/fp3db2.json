    "postText": "I was blessed to be admitted to the McCombs school of UT Austin , Babson and Vandy. I would like to work in financial services at a Schawb or Vanguard and study finance but Vandy doesn\u2019t have Finance but they have a strong economics &amp; HOD program. As far as finances go i would pay nothing to attend UT, i would pay around 7.5K a year for Vandy and 9K a year for Babson. I am not in the best financial situation so i got a nice amount of aid from all my schools. I am starting to lean towards Vandy though, I\u2019m from Texas :) Please leave advice and opinions!",

Babson has fine placement, but it\u2019s still working on that name brand outside of the northeast. Unless you want a small school that only has business with a focus on entrepreneurship or a northeast education I would choose vandy.  Nashville is also a great city.",

Resumes from other schools have to be particularly captivating for those candidates to be considered. These would be target schools. \n\nHere is some more information as it pertains to one branch of finance: \n\nhttps://www.wallstreetoasis.com/faq/what-are-a-target-semi-target-and-non-target-schools\n\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with any of the schools on your list. Babson provides an excellent education and you are almost practically guaranteed a job after graduating if you are a decent student. UT Austin has good finance placement as well. Vanderbilt just has a slightly better brand than the others.",

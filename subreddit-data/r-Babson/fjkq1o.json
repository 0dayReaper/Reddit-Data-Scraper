            "comment": "Typically the interview is done in person and is a mixture of individual and group activities but with the virus happening, I assume the process will be different. The percentage of women who receive the scholarship out of those who are interviewed for the program varies by year. In general, around 20 women get the scholarship. Before this year, it\u2019s always been referred to as CWEL Scholar program so you can look up information on that as well. It\u2019s a great program so good luck with the interview!",

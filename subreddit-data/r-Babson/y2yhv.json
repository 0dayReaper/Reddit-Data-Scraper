Said already, but to reiterate, FME is the biggest shitshow - during my year we had some girl take up sexual harassment charges against another student, we almost got sued by Dodge, and someone tried to orchestrate a hostile takeover of our company and throw out the CEO. To survive this, be President of Community Service - if people don't do what you say, they fail the course simple as that. \n\nBabson gets much easier as the years go forward. Avoid Professor Kent Jones for Economics - he's really smart but super boring. Trim sucks, Reynolds is alright and get a car ASAP.",

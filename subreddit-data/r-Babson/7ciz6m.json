            "comment": "General interview advice:\n\n* Research the person interviewing you a little bit before the interview. Check their linkedin or something. \n* Come with a few questions to ask the person. \n* Its better to be overdressed than underdressed.  \n* Don't chew gum and silence your phone \n* Bring a copy of your resume/examples of work in a folder or portfolio\n* Be yourself. Understand that this is a chance for you to interview the company/school as much as it is for the interviewer to interview you. \n\nI see that you are doing the IB program from your post history. IB students are some of the top performers here, you are definitely qualified. Talk about your EE if its any good and maybe bring a copy. ",

About the dress code - I live in West Africa and formal clothing is different from that of American clothing. Would you reccomend I wear something more traditional (like a boubou) or stick to western style? If it helps, I've been in contact with my interviewer and he's of an international background. ",

Definitely do your research about the alumni interviewing you so you can ask questions about them. (LINKEDIN) Turn the interview around if you can by asking questions instead of being asked questions. This shows interest in your interviewer and Babson. This also lets them talk about their life in Babson and the path they took to where they are now today. Also know that the alumni interviewer may be more nervous about this interview than you are. (They are not admissions staff). Be yourself. Be friendly. You'll do well",

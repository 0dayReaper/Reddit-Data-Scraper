It teaches you the entrepreneurial mindset, which is all about innovation (and is also applicable for management). If you have any Babson specific questions, feel free to reach out. I\u2019m a recent ugrad alum.",

There are also peer reviews, so everyone is incentivized to work hard and do a good job, because the individual grade and group grade for group projects are tied together.",

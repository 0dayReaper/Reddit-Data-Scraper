The deadline is coming up in less than two weeks and I need to make my decision ASAP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow rigorous is the workload at Babson, is it as bad as they say it is? \n\nHow's the social life?",

            "comment": "The workload at Babson isn\u2019t terrible and pretty manageable with no classes on friday. Professors say to do 1.5-2 hours of work for every hour of class time per class. However you don\u2019t need to do that much necessarily. \n\nAs for the social life, don\u2019t come here if you want to party. You\u2019d be better off going to Boston U or NYU for that. YoThere are frat parties here but they\u2019re not nearly what you\u2019d find at larger schools. The party life is definitely better if you\u2019re an athlete, too. That being said, Boston is obviously a huge college city so there\u2019s other opportunities to go to parties at other schools.",

    "postText": "Good afternoon everybody,\nI wanted to take a moment and trouble some of you for advice. I have been looking into Babson for quite awhile now. They are my #1 choice however, I have some odd circumstances. For starters I was a terrible high school student. However, I was combating two learning disabilities and some unorthodox living conditions. I since have been living on my own since I was seventeen. I have always had an entrepreneurial spirit. I have been at a community college for a year and some change now. I have a 4.0 GPA while also being the Student Government President at our school. I have two businesses that I am in the process of starting up. I sit on the schools board of trustees at my school. I have letters of recommendation from our schools president. I also have letters of recommendation from my old high school principal who now works at my college. I figured he would be ideal to show my educational evolution. I would love any advice. Babson would most certainly give me the foundational support for my success. However, I know a single school won\u2019t define me but Babson sure would help! \n\nThanks for the advice in advance!",

                            "comment": "well it's a pretty strange student body (this is for undergrad)  \nabout a third of the students are international with the most notable segments as south american, chinese, and indian students. They tend to remain within their national groups/primary language groups, so it doesn't feel that culturally integrated, but I understand that. \n\nI read somewhere that a little over half of the students pay full tuition. I cannot find the source anymore. I do not know if that includes people who take out loans to attend. The thought of somebody going into debt to attend Babson is enough to drive me insane. \"In 2017, undergraduates borrowing for educational expenses at Babson graduated with an average debt of $35,013\" from Babson's website.   \n\n\nSo there are a lot of people who are chill about spending around a quarter million dollars for this experience. I selected Babson when I was 17 and I did not understand the context around how much money this is. No offense, but you probably don't totally understand how much this really is either. If I could do it over, I probably would have gone to a less expensive school.  \n\n\nBack to social scene:\n\nMany people bond over stock and crypto investments and poker if you get invited into a circle.\n\nThen there are athletes that usually hang out with their teams and have mixer parties with other Babson teams. There is no football or \"game day\" events or spirit.   \n\n\nThere is no LGBTQ or visible gay community at Babson. The artistic and musical people at Babson exist, but they are not well-organized together. There is some small jazz band, a student led dance recital, and improv (I do not know the state of it). Babson TV does not exist. Babson Radio (not on the radio) is not really active now, but there is a room with a couple USB mics, LED strip lights, desks, and a couch. The parties are not super fun. In fact, I'd say they are awkward. It is not a super political school.  \n\n\nA significant contributing factor to social issues is the proximity to off campus offerings. Unlike a college town, Babson has no walkable bars. The town strip of Wellesley is about a 25 minute walk away. Shops and restaurants close early. I don't think there is a real student oriented bar. On campus, there is Roger's Pub. I'm confused as to whether or not it reopened yet, but it was closed through most of the fall. When you think of the location from a distant perspective, you might think \"oh it's only a 30 minute drive from Boston\", but 30 minutes one way is a long time. If you have a car, you have to pay for parking downtown. If you don't, then the Ubers cost about $25-$50 and sometimes are far away. Babson's closest T Stop is a 10-15 minute drive, there's some Uber program where certain times Thurs-Sunday you get free rides between Babson and the Woodland T stop. I think you get $5 off a trip to Boston during the same times.  \n\n\nI would say, you can get by without a lot of spending cash, but it is likely that your friends will do things without you or encourage spending. I'd plan on spending about $50-100 a week (not including using your meal plan dollars) - that is if you go to Boston at least twice a month.  \n\n\nOn a final note, I have met some cool people here and there and I made it work by also meeting people at Wellesley and Olin. It just feels like I am trying to socially operate under pretty heavy constraints and that is not fun.   \n\n\nWe are all the same major, so you don't really get a new perspective of somebody who studies philosophy or chemistry or political science.   \n\n\nI would probably be speaking less negatively about the social scene if there was an earnest effort from administrators to integrate the student body, to help transport students to towns and to Boston, and to support the administrative work required to run a club/org.   \n\n\nI have had a lot of fun with people there before, but they graduated and I don't think their vibe was adequately replaced. The vibe is incredibly dull on campus right now. I'm happy I live off campus.",

However, 30 minutes one way isn\u2019t unbearable for me. I drove an hour one way to work for a solid year. So I\u2019m lucky with that aspect. Social life does seem quite indifferent. At least, I know some mandarin. Hopefully that will help me if I\u2019m accepted. Luckily I have a special listing in my FAFSA since I am an independent. I do have a real concept of how consuming a chunk of debt like that weighs on one individual. I am hoping I get some sort of aid however.",

I would also warn that, although the future of business in math, data analytics, and computer science, Babson does not have good stem classes.   \n\n\nRecognize that housing on campus costs over 11,000 for the year and the required meal plan is over 2,700 per semester. It's not just about having the debt, but it's about what else you can do with the money. That is a third of a deposit on a nice starter house. If you have a cheaper option like UMass, then go for it.  \n\n\nAlso, most students go into finance 25%, consulting 11% and bizdev/sales 10%, entrepreneurship is only about 6-7%",

I\u2019m a rising sophomore at Babson.\n\nSo I just learned that it\u2019s practically impossible to get sponsored for a H1B or even get approval through a LOTTERY system for internationals. So, I was wondering where do undergraduate international students usually work post-grad? \n\n\nAs an international student who pays full price tuition, it just disappoints me to think that my Babson diploma might not be worth it at all especially if I go back to my homecountry (where salary levels are not competitive).",

            "comment": "Most international students have to go to graduate school and earn a Masters degree if they want to stay in the US. The H1B visas are really only obtainable for professionals (usually engineers) with several years of work experience. \n\nIf you get a graduate degree you can then stay for 2 + years under the OPT program but many kids still have to return to their countries because it\u2019s hard to get a job with little work experience. You are competing with US graduates and there are no lack of them looking for work. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why kids are not informed that you can\u2019t stay here legally after you graduate or the school Doesn\u2019t tell all prospective students that apply. Canada is much more favorable to immigration and they have lots of start up companies in Toronto. Think about transferring \u2014 you just can\u2019t waste time and Babson is not internationally recognized. It\u2019s a decent school but international kids get hired by rankings of their colleges and it\u2019s size puts them in a different league than Northeastern, BU, Boston College or uMass Isenberg. \n\nSo sorry to hear about your predicament but Babson has a huge percentage of full pay kids @ $75,000 a year because they value you and your money. Push back with them and see how they can help but buyer beware for sure. \n\nHope your situation improves - best of luck (I live nearby so I am very familiar with Babson )",

Sucks that I only knew about it this year. I could\u2019ve gone for Canada or UK instead. \n\nI\u2019m trying to be optimistic with my degree though \u2014 I\u2019ll use it to my advantage as an aspiring entrepreneur in my homecountry. Hopefully that will help with the degree\u2019s ROI",

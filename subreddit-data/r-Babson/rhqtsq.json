Babson is my dream school, so by all means it was worth it for me.\n\nI'll be entering with about 100 others (September was about 500), so it's not a transfer-like experience socially...  I do FME with the Sophomores next year, can graduate in 7 semesters, and have the same opportunities as everyone else.  Plus, I've had 6 months to explore  interests outside of academics.\n\nI can't give you the best answer since I haven't started yet, but I love Babson so there was no second thought.",

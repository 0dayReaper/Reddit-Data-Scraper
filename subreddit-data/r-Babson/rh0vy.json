            "comment": "I doubt the \"bad graduate\" idea. I've been here for 3 years and to say there has been some dramatic shift at babson which has changed the underling strength of the degree would just not be well founded. Nor did previous graduates somehow mess it up by not getting good jobs or something like that. The way these rankings are calculated are through use of formulas and metrics that measure the schools and spit out a result. The likelyhood was that they changed one of the metrics in the measuring process or Babson somehow performed poorly in a metric that they normally do well in. I think that seems like a much more likely situation than bad graduates messing it up. Just my opinion though.",

            "comment": "&gt; We're under Bentley. BENTLEY.\n\nIt hurts.\n\nAt any rate, it appears that we lost major points in recruiter relations. Looks like CCD is going to get chewed out, and re-done. Schlesinger also mentioned a mistake in measuring the student:professor ratio, that was erroneously recorded as 1:32 instead of 1:22. Given U.S. News' operating trends, this mistake will bode well for us in the future.\n\nAnother good point will be the shift in the FME program next year. The change might be enough to keep Babson relevant and refreshing, which will improve counselor ratings immensely. Inversely, if it sucks, it could reduce student rankings. I'm thinking the latter over the former, as the program will divide classes into 45 students, as opposed to 60 per class. This is going to create a problem. Babson had a hard enough time accommodating 18 FME businesses this year. We're going to have even more next year. Unless they can build those new facilities this summer, it's going to be a joke.\n\n\n",

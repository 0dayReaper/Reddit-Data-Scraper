            "comment": "1. No idea what the exact percentage is. I heard from an admissions rep that the ED admissions rate is similar to the regular decision rate (\\~25%).\n2. No idea.\n3. From a post last year: \n\n\"Deferral is not the end of the journey to get accepted. When I applied to business school I was wait listed. I reached out the my admission counselor on a frequent, but not obnoxious basis. I sent in an additional recommendation and reminded the school they were my top choice. I got in off the wait list. This is a deferral which means you are up against the regular decision pool. I think if you remind them that this is your dream school and if admitted you are coming that will go a long way. Ask the admissions counselor is there is anything else you can do to demonstrate interest. Just my quick thoughts......\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre you international or domestic? Admissions for domestic students is need-blind. Good luck!",

Similar to a common application, schools fill it out, it is a standard form so apples can be compared to apples.  It\u2019s mostly used for marketing and ranking but I used it during college searches.",

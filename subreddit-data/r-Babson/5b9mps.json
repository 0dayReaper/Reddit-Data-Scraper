    "postText": "I am an Indian student and I recently applied to Babson recently in the 'Early Action'.\nThe application checklist shows that my 1st quarter grades have not been received. However, our school has a semester marking system instead of a quarterly marking system. What should I do to sort this problem?",

            "comment": "I had the same problem when I applied last year. I called admissions and they told me they accept a report of your mid-semester grades. I would talk to a guidance counselor or headmaster about how to go about sending them. Since your report will probably be an unofficial transcript make sure that whoever sent it signs it or can verify it's real in some other way. Admissions here was very accommodating with me, so don't worry about your application being thrown out or anything like that. ",

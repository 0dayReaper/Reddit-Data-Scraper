    "postText": "hi!! so i\u2019m debating at this point between whether to submit a video or an essay for the weissman scholarship.\n\nat first i planned to do a video because i thought it might show the creative &amp; innovative side of me but the 2 minute limit is really short and i feel like i have a lot more to say.\n\non the other hand, i feel like an essay might be pretty boring for admission officers even though i think i\u2019m a pretty decent writer\n\nwhat is the better option?? please help! :\u201d)",

            "comment": "I've never applied for the Weissman scholarship, but I'm personally a big fan of making videos over essays, simply because it sticks out to admissions. Making a video is harder than an essay, so only a few people make videos in a sea of essays. I imagine those few videos would stick out more than the essays.\n\nFull disclosure, I'm not in admissions and I could be wrong, but I don't think the video could hurt.",

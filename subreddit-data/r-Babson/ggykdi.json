    "postText": "I got off the waitlist at babson for the January admit program. I was gonna to Kelley school or business  before that. If I\u2019m more into starting my own business or working with my family business what\u2019s the best fit? ( fyi Kelley is 41k per year for me and babson is 75k)\n- is the quality of education/professors/coursework as good as they claim it to be?\n- what kind of mba schools do graduates from either school go to?\n- what companies offer job placement and internships etc at babson?",

Besides the great education you will be surrounding yourself with entrepreneurial minded professors and students.   Many students\u2019 parents at Babson run successful family businesses so the students know a lot just from growing up in that atmosphere.   Up to you ultimately but Babson is an excellent school.",

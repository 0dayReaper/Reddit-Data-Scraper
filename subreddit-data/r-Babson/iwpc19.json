This year you are eligible to apply as a transfer student if you are in the process of completing your first semester of college at the time of application.** \n\nAny Idea why they might have made this change?",

Smart, hard working kids for sure but not many US kids are willing to pay $75,000 a year when they can get a tippy top degree from a nationally ranked university.",

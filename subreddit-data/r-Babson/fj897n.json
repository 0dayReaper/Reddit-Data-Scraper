Since I only came in the spring semester, I had to stay for the summer and it kinda sucked because it was mandatory. However I know it\u2019s no longer mandatory and you can choose to take classes for the summer if you wish. Aside from staying for the summer I had no complaints. The January cohort was a good group of friends and great opportunities to bond and I\u2019m still friends with today.",

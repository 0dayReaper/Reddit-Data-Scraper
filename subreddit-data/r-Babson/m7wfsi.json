So far everybody got the same mail message.\n\nThe packages you see in Instagram are probably the standard information packages you get from every college that accepted you via application portal. \n\nIt's just irritating because some EDs posted something about a UPS letter being announced before they got their decision.\n\nBut maybe I am wrong.\n\nYou know what? It's only a little over 24 hours until we know for sure \ud83d\ude09. Wait and see...",

I am not expecting to be accepted. \n\nDamn, got excellent GPA and scores, bunch of good recommendations, essay was not bad, but didn\u2019t do an interview (did you?). Maybe that was the failure. \ud83e\udd14 But you never really know how the admission boards make there decisions and what they are looking for. \n\nBabson was one of my favorites, but not the only one. I already have received excellent offers from Bryant and Bentley, Rollins and few more are still in the loop.\n\nAll that got an UPS announcement \ud83d\ude09 congratulations! I hope everybody else have great alternatives if not accepted by Babson \ud83d\udc4d.",

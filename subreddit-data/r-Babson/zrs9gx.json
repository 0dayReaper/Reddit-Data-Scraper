The easiest way to get there is to take the shuttle between Babson, Olin, and Wellesley. Olin is the more popular school students cross register to since it's right next door and has more of the technical classes you can't find at Babson.",

I recommend going to the many bars in the area such as Lil' Richies, or giving Olin a try, I hear their women are objectively attractive! (If you're into armpit hair and mohawks, that is)",

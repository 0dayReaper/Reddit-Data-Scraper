There's certainly a larger portion of students who do that here compared to other schools. A lot of the entrepreneurship learned is applied to jobs people have within big businesses.\n\nThird, it's a business school. You should know that if you go to any business school you can get a major in any business sector, so it's really up to you to decide. \n\nWhere you work, and how much you get paid is just done to what you want to do, where you want to work and how good you're at it.",

Regardless of your concentration you'll have a bachelors degree in management and well versed knowledge of many elements of business (ops, marketing, accounting, finance, leadership, etc). It's a great school if you want to be in business. Even if you're an artist, you'll learn how to manage your art business. ",

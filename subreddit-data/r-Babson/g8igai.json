    "postText": "I got a 1420 on the psat in sophomore year without studying so I am assuming I will get above a 1500 on the sat (Ik this kind of sounds cocky). My unweighted gpa was a 3.88 freshman and should finish at a 3.8 this year. I take all honors + 2 aps sophomore year and I plan on taking 4 next year. I play baseball, and I participate in 5 clubs including interact. I\u2019m trying to focus on leadership next year. I plan on getting my bba from babson then getting a mba from a top tier business school after 3-4 years of working experience.\n\nQuestions:\n1. Do I have a good chance of getting in?\n2. How do I get into a good MBA school besides doing very well at babson?",

The problem is that I don\u2019t know what schools would be a target school for me. I have plenty of reach schools, BC UMich, UVA, BU, but I don\u2019t really have any good target business schools.",

Not sure how good you are at baseball but both these schools are D3 and that can help you get in too (there is limited help in d3 from coaches but they can nudge).  Good luck.",

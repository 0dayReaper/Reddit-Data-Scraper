    "postText": "I'm looking for an after school babysitter for my two boys, ages 8 and 11, anywhere from one to four days a week (MTWF).  If you have no afternoon classes any of those days and have experience and interest in babysitting, please let me know.  Hours would be 2:45ish - 6ish MTW and 12:30 - 6ish Fridays.  We live about 10 minutes away from Babson.  Good driving ability is a must as there will be some school pickups; we can provide a car if helpful.\n\nI've searched online to see if there's an online bulletin board or better way to reach Babson students but didn't find anything -- if you know of anything I'd appreciate your letting me know.",

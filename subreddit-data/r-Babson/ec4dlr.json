And I just want to know your guys opinion as to why I was not accepted, here are my stats:\n-3.49 unweighted GPA \n-1230 SAT\n-Took 6 AP classes throughout high school \n-I am Bolivian (went through recent crisis)\n-No financial aid needed \n-Created a charity for cancer children \n-worked in my parents company for several years \n-been involved in MANY more extra curriculars",

I reached out the my admission counselor on a frequent, but not obnoxious basis.   I sent in an additional recommendation and reminded the school they were my top choice.   I got in off the wait list.  This is a deferral which means you are up against the regular decision pool.  I think if you remind them that this is your dream school and if admitted you are coming that will go a long way.  Ask the admissions counselor is there is anything else you can do to demonstrate interest.    Just my quick thoughts......",

If babson is your dream school and you want higher chances i recommend applying for their GAP program. They dont count those students' stats as part of admissions so youll have higher chances if ur grade is what ur worried about.\n\nJust cus ur deferred or waitlisted doesn't mean ur not qualified. Babson just seems subpar at selecting for excellence sometimes. \n\n-waitlisted international GAP sophomore currently maintaining a 3.9",

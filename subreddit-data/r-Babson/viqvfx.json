That said - I don't think that will be the differentiating factor to get in - also depends on if you are international student or domestic.  That said - your grades are fine - I knew plenty of kids with average GPAs that got in.",

I think my biggest advice is to consider Babson more like a tech school in that it is strictly business focused. All the other liberal arts and sciences classes are just to check the boxes.  I enjoyed my time at Babson - since its a small school - social life is split into 3 categories - Sports Teams - Greek Life - Internationals.  If you don't fall into those 3 - you either have a social life outside of Babson or have a small clique of friends.",

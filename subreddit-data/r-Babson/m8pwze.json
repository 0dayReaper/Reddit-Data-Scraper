I guess the first accepted students will withdraw beginning April, when all schools answered. The biggest batch on offers to the waitlist will probably be mid-May, when they really know who is coming or not.\n\nI read that you can enroll in other colleges, and they would still tolerate a change if you decide for Babson  as long you were waitlisted there.\n\nBut maybe someone knows better how it was the last years. Did you check the 2024 threads?",

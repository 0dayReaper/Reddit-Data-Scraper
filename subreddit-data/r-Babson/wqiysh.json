            "comment": "Babson\u2019s pretty good with job placement if you put in a bit of effort. Just get decent grades, join clubs you like, and worry about getting an internship sophomore year. A business frat is also a pretty good place for professional connections, and an easy way to an internship/job imo.\n\nSocial scene is good for a small college in the middle of a wealthy suburb. All the freshman are itching for friends the first month so you\u2019ll probably find your group. If you\u2019re an introvert, make an effort to be around people and go to events. If you find your vice to be alcohol or weed than even easier, as the search for that will bring you together. Just take it slow and know your limits. Make sure you check out stoop and late night Rey\u2019s. Good luck and have fun!",

I have heard a lot about babsons social scene and I am hoping that babson students do have a lot of fun and it is nothing less than other colleges. I have also heard babson is top for business and has a very strong reputation is this true?",

    "postText": "So basically I requested for an interview during the time period right after Nov 1, and like a few days later they emailed me saying how they said they have received my request and the alum should be contacting me soon. And like they didn't so I emailed back to them after a week and they were like we will get back to you asap and they didn't. So I didn't get to interview... do you think It will ruin my chance?? I'm a girl who ED and is from Korea (international)",

I hope this is not the truth\n\nI decided to come to this school b/c they're no.1 in entrepreneurship but the people just say this is just fake marketing to make students come\n\nif it is true, then what's the reason to attend Babson\n\nLiterally useless even more than Community colleges\n\n(+ I heard that alumni connection is not very good here b/c many people said alumni never help or respond to undergraduate students who are asking for help, and also faculties don't care about those things)  ",

            "comment": "Middle-class (Babson poor) juniors perspective here. This \u201cmature\u201d alumni seems a bit conceited to me. FME ceo \ud83e\udd13, like stfu you were 18. And how can you be in a sorority AND fraternity. Did you switch genders or is it a business fraternity? \n\nSure, it\u2019s tough to form the close friendship type network with the rich students because you can\u2019t keep up with the outings, different upbringings, etc. But I\u2019d say there are lots of events for networking and job opportunities (though it\u2019s not a walk on the park). The rich kids have an upper hand because their parents did it for them. These events are for the entire student body, rich or poor. And yes the student body is ambitious, we naturally attract high achieving people who want to get down to business.\n\nI\u2019m confused as to what part your discouraged about. Yeah, if you\u2019re lazy you\u2019re not going to get the job you want. Is that not all colleges? If you want to network with rich people for entrepreneurship and you have a good idea, go to Babson first. They LOVE their entrepreneurs and they set you up with all types of events, networks, funding (if it\u2019s a great idea). The rich people/alumni will follow.\n\nFor other career paths, why would you need to network with rich kids. They can\u2019t do a damn thing for you unless they\u2019re giving you a job. And I imagine reaching out to alumni is similar at many schools. Few are gonna agree to a 15 min call with you, and what makes you so special that they\u2019d agree to refer you to a job? Because you\u2019re a kid at their old school? Wow that\u2019s crazy.\n\n**In summary, if you put in the work you\u2019ll be fine. If Babson is your dream school keep doing research and dont be discouraged.** I joined a business fraternity, learned some SQL and Tableau, and got my internship in tech sophomore year because of the connections. And I\u2019m Babson poor. \n\nMy friend in consulting grinded for his gpa, joined consulting club e board, mcfee, consulting interview prep, coffee chats with employees/employers and he\u2019s making more than me this summer. My friend in investment banking did something similar but instead took leadership roles in other clubs. \n\nMy friends in accounting grind for the gpa, get the credits for cpa certification as quick as they can, and make damn sure they don\u2019t mess up anything in relation to the Big 4.",

                    "comment": "Hi there! Thank you for your thoughtful comment. I am joining Babson this fall and I'm very focused on entrepreneurship/starting a new venture, which is the reason why I chose Babson. I'm doing a lot of research these days but I want to know if the Babson professors, programs, and activities are \"actually\" giving practical help and opportunities to students in the process of making a business model, getting an evaluation, and receiving funding for their new startups. Programs like Butler LaunchPad, Rocket Pitch, Summer Venture Program, Summer Catalyst, B.E.T.A challenge, e-Tower, CWEL activities, and any other clubs related to startups are surely a lot of opportunities compared to other colleges but I heard only a few people are able to participate in those programs b/c they are too competitive. And also I want to know recent alumni who are running successful businesses... and one last question, is quitting a school and starting their own thing when they find items common in Babson? Do professors make a lot of connections with students? I heard there are many professors who are actually running their own company so they're able to give a lot of practical real-world advice or recommendations opportunities such as funding, internships, etc. I looked into RatemyProfessor but I couldn't really find many reviews about Babson professors. I'm sorry if this post made you feel uncomfortable or offensive, I'm just so desperate in making a successful startup and participating in as many events/activities as I could to achieve that. I thought Babson was no.1 for that but the screenshots made me feel depressed even before I go to Babson.",

It sounds like an alumni got bored, felt like bragging about all their accomplishments to the Internet, and didn\u2019t want to pass any credit off to anyone else. Even the title seems braggadocios: \u201ctop preforming Babson student\u201d\u2026 Ok buddy. \n\nI have a friend at Babson right now and he absolutely loves it. Don\u2019t be put off by one or two cynical comments. Babson\u2019s graduation rate, ROI outcomes, etc. speak for themselves. It\u2019s an excellent business school and students routinely thrive in it.",

            "comment": "Look at the ROI, percentage graduated/percentage with jobs, average starting salary stats. You can also browse linkedin for recent grads to see what kind of jobs they are landing. Tier one companies like Google, Goldman, etc. are going to require above average academic effort and some degree of networking to stand out against Ivy league grads. If you just want to land a job after graduating and you have interest in business, Babson is a safe choice. If you expect the flexibility of a university with STEM focused classes unrelated to business, you are going to be disappointed. The curriculum makes an honest effort to incorporate entrepreneurship into a bunch of classes, but at the end of the day I would say its just a unique way of covering all the different aspects of how a company runs. If you are deadset on entrepreneurship, I recall there being dedicated resources to helping students and there are other classes focused on tools to help an entrepreneur like VC raises, etc. \n\nAlso, Babson is a fairly small and cliquey community. If you don't find a group, you might be left feeling like an outsider. There are definitely some wealthy students, but I would still say the student body consists of predominately middle class backgrounds. I couldn't imagine taking a $20k loan (who is lending that money?) to try and \"fit-in. \n\nThe alumni community is smaller than many other universities, but I've found it to generally be helpful. \n\nMost of the negative comments on this subreddit are from a small number of users with repeat posts and these screenshots sound a bit exaggerated.",

                    "comment": "but my question is... how come they do not have STEM-focused classes? STEM skills are literally used in every part of businesses and startups these days. The curriculum seems quite outdated. I heard Babson, Olin college of engineering, and Wellesley are linked with partnership so that we could take classes there and also do projects/research/programs/services together. Is that correct? In that way, it seems easier to do networking for entrepreneurship or getting a job",

            "comment": " \n\nBabson is known for its entrepreneurial opportunities, ranking #1 nationally. Babson offers entrepreneurship opportunities through its course-work, guest speakers, the Entrepreneurship Tower (Etower), pitch competitions, and other resources on campus like the Center for Women's Entrepreneurship and the Family Entrepreneurship Center. Students are encouraged to network and even intern with alumni who have started their own businesses. The passion and drive for entrepreneurship is definitely reflected through life on campus. \n\nAs for campus life, Babson is one of the smaller campuses, so you are always bumping into people you know. It is easy to make friends and get to know people here as people are friendly and approachable. There are a lot of events on campus through Student Government, Campus Activities Board, and from the many other organizations on campus. The diversity organizations put on shows every semester as well. The campus social scene is very organization-driven. Fraternities, sororities, athletics, and the other organizations on campus such as the ONE diversity tower are known for creating a social life on campus. Special interest communities at Babson such as CREATE and Women Giving Back offer weekly meetings and a good opportunity to make friends. Babson also has an uber discount program which many students use to go into Boston and have fun on the weekends. We are a suburban campus, so students either go out in the local towns for dinner, shopping etc, or explore Boston (30 min away) for more options. There is a lot to do both on and off campus.",

            "comment": "Graduated last year. You wanna start something innovative and have support from professors and other students (if you find the right crowd)? Go for it. Babson has great education and you feel and indeed become ready to accomplish anything in the business world. \n\nNightlife? Well it depends on what you\u2019re looking for. \n\nNightlife outside of campus: Babson is located in Wellesley, a rich town 30 minutes away from where things happen in Boston (by Uber - which will cost you $30 each way). If money isn\u2019t your concern and you can spend about $150 every time you go into the city to party, go for it. Btw the internationals are the ones who do this the most. \n\nParties on campus are mostly done by athletes, sororities and fraternities (mostly American students playing American music - you\u2019ll hear stuff like Mr. Brightside or music \u201cappropriate for grinding\u201d). It can be cool if you go with your friends, but not alone as people aren\u2019t that welcoming in parties - kids are competitive even when drinking Jesus Christ.",

            "comment": "Hey, I have exchanged to Babson few years ago. If you need anything just ask me so you can fulfill your experience.\n\nThe education is great, professors and staffs support you a lot. If you need anything, just ask them. Just choose the good courses.\n\nFinding a friend is quite hard if you're not familiar with the American culture and not good at speaking and listening English. The students in bachelor program are quite competitive and focus on their goals. Even the school has a lots of international students but they focus on business, not the cultural exchange so it might take a long time for you to have friends. But for Master students, they are open and it's easy to talk to them.\n\nParties: not so bad but sometimes the room dorm is quite small to have everyone in. If you're not familiar with American music, you might don't like it. Go with your friends so you can enjoy the parties better.\n\nBut don't limit yourself, you can go to Boston and explore the city. You can take the subway (about $2.75 to $5 for each way) or you can call Uber to go the the subway station ($5-$10) then go to the city by subway.\n\nIf you exchange for 1 year, you can consider to apply AIESEC in Boston, they are international students so you can easily find friends and adapt the cultures.",

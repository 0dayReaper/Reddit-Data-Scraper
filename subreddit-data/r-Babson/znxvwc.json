But now that I am deffered I want to keep my options open. Does any students at Babson or fellow seniors know of any schools similar in the 20%-60% range?\n\nAlso does anyone have the data set of the rate of deferral to acceptance?",

It\u2019s not a bad school, but if you have any financial issues\u2014if you are taking out loans to go to Babson when you could go to a decent state school loan-free, then Babson is not worth it.\n\nEdit: my b thought you got rejected/waitlisted",

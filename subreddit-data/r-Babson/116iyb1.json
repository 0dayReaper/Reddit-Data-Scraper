He says the curriculum has very good classes, and that he feels well prepared to transition to a finance career after graduation. I applied to the MSF after he highly recommended it. \nOn another note, does anyone know when R2 decisions are coming out? I got accepted into another program and have to respond by the 16th but would rather go to Babson.",

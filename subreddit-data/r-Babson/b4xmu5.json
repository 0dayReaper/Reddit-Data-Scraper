Central is  best location wise as the center of campus, but limited as quarters between rooms are too close. Enjoy your time, and roommates can change.",

My understanding of new freshman is that they can get placed in Forest, central, west, north, or Mattos. Aside from the \u201chealthy living\u201d style dorms (not sure if that is still a thing) I don\u2019t think that they have a say in which dorm they get. \n\nCentral has also been completely renovated and west is still pretty new, so lots of good options there.

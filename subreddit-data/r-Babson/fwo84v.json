    "postText": "Babson apparently takes around 65 students a year (50 fall, 15 spring). It sounds competitive to me and I hardly have heard of any transfer stories.\n\nI applied as a freshman this year but was rejected. I'm either attending Loyola Chicago or UIC for a semester (or until sophmore year). \n\nSome questions I have: Were you transferring out from a private, public, or community college? What was your transcript looking like? How far into college were you already? How was the aid offered?",

I was transferring out of a large public institution, but I was in the honors college. After I submitted my application, I had a 4.0 college GPA (didn't really take many easy intro classes at all).  I don't know if I'm going to transfer there, but I will have finished one full academic year. \n\nAid is dependent on your FAFSA/CSS Profile, no merit aid is given during the transfer process.",

I was sitting in the low 90s percentile (which is not bad, but comparatively to those with 1500+ SAT and/or 33+ ACT).  I had a lot of extracurriculars, both in high school and college, and I've pursued internships and research throughout my time.  Be sure to keep yourself involved and try to further your knowledge and education! \nFeel free to dm if you have more questions",

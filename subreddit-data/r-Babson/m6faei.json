Take over some leadership roles, do something interesting outside your curriculum, like starting a small business. All that really improves your chances for Babson.\n\nI would also consider European universities... they are far cheaper and also excellent.\n\nhttps://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2020/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats",

There are need-blinded colleges like Amherst or some Ivy League colleges. But that's also the reason they are very selective.\nI would maybe consider looking at colleges that are lower ranked, but not necessarily academically bad. They are probably more open offering full tuition. 100% also means your parents don't earn more than $50k a year. \n\nLook at the college search sites. My favorites were Niche, Bigfuture and Cappex for searching, CollegeFactual and USNews for ranking.\n\nBeing a junior means you have a lot of time to gather information \ud83d\udc4d",

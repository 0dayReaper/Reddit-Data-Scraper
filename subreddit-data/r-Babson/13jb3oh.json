    "postText": "Hi I\u2019m an upcoming masters students and am a bit confused on what location to look for housing in. From what I heard Brighton is the most popular choice, but it\u2019s a 20 min drive from babson and commute is further. Then there\u2019s Newton, Needham, Brookline, Allston. \n\nWhere do most master\u2019s students live and why\u2019d you choose that location. How do you commute and how long does it take daily? Do you have classes everyday if the week or how does the schedule look like. \nAny insights would be helpful to understand! Thank you",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, \nI'm a freshman in NYU right now and am seriously so interested in going to Babson. My main concern is the financial aid I'd be receiving. Is Babson known for giving out good financial aid to students due to the small amount of undergrads? Also, what do you think I need to get into Babson? I think I have a B/B+ in precalc, A- in intro to macroeconomics, A- in writing, A in an interdisciplinary class. I interned at a startup last year going into college and have no extracurriculars right now..",

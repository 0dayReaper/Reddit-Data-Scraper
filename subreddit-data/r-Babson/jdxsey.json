I might not paint an exact percentage chance, however, I am very very optimistic that you can get in. You've well demonstrated a self-starter attitude and I believe that is what Babson seeks. Just make sure that you are able to paint it down vividly in your application.\n\nALL THE VERY BEST! I hope you land the scholarship! :)",

The students were from all over the world including Afghanistan, Columbia, Rwanda; Belarus, and South Africa. I read about the program and students on their website. \n\nJust FYI - Babson is located in a quiet, family oriented suburb 17 miles west of Boston. Most kids have a car. There are probably shuttles to Cambridge and Boston though. It\u2019s a good school but you won\u2019t be in a big city. Wellesley College is nearby but totally different vibe. 30% are international students so there is a diverse culture. Good luck ,",

It\u2019s not a wealthy school so they can only offer a few fully paid scholarships. No idea what their selection process is but underrepresented minorities will be getting lots of offers this year because of racial inequities in the US. I wish you good luck,",

    "postText": "Hey guys! I am deciding between Business Analytics+ITM at Babson or Commerce+CS at University of Virginia. Babson will give me that entrepreneurial skillset and curriculum as well as smaller classes and an ambitious, diverse student body that I want. But the HIGH cost, less name recognition/clout with jobs, farther location, and perhaps boring experience still stop me from committing to Babson. \n\nWhat made you guys choose Babson? Also are there job or internship opportunities (paid) on campus or near campus that students can get? Can anyone here give me their experience concentrating in Info Technology Management? How is the career center? Financials/money as well as a fun, activity filled experience are what I am wary about.\n\nsorry for all of the questions, I just want to give Babson a thorough analysis in my decision!",

I\u2019m not really sure what you mean by Babson being a boring experience, so it would be helpful for you to elaborate so I can give you a better answer :)",

            "comment": "I\u2019ll answer the ones I know. And I\u2019d go as far to say that Babson has better name recognition in the Northeast/Globally than UVA.\n\nI was down to choosing between Babson and UVA too. My decision making process isn\u2019t for everyone but I\u2019ll explain. I didn\u2019t have that many requirements for a school so I found a college ranking website I liked (niche.com), and chose the higher ranked school for business. UVA was one rank above Babson in 2019 so I was set to choose that, but they didn\u2019t give me enough money so I chose Babson. Funny thing is now, Babson is above UVA on the site.\n\nLots of opportunities but wouldn\u2019t recommend trying to find a job in the Boston area (30 min drive) until you\u2019re adjusted to campus (unless you just got it like that). There are lots of job opportunities on campus but they go quickly so you should get ahead of other freshman and apply before the school year starts. I found two jobs first semester while some freshman were struggling to get one in the school year because they waited. Then stumbled onto a third job in the spring (All through Babson).\n\nThere\u2019s an IT job on campus (pays higher than the rest too) I\u2019m sure you can snag by sophomore year if you\u2019re proactive about it. \n\nCareer Center Helps With (Best to Worst IMO)\n1. Handshake - Personalized job/internship application site for Babson students. Live update of postings. Companies contacted Babson to be on the site so they want Babson students.\n2. Job Fairs every semester- Fairly pointless for freshman because most companies are looking for upperclassmen. But nice to know they\u2019re there for the future and seems like a good way to catch a job/internship.\n3. Appointments with CCD faculty - Up to you to schedule an appointment. Usually just schedule one to help with my resume. Also help with strategies for finding alumni to contact, strategies for job/internship searching, etc.\n\nCheck the social scene post on the subreddit for more on that. And for clubs and orgs, while there are less than at a big state school, you should find at least one you want to be a part of. Emphasize SHOULD. If you\u2019re an active person I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have anything to worry about with finding an activity filled experience.",

            "comment": "UVA hands down. National research university with outstanding professors and hundreds of courses to choose from including amazing electives.\n\nBabson is a very small, New England regional school that attracts wealthy kids who want to be entrepreneurs but most business majors want high paying corporate jobs. It\u2019s a very focused niche school. Ask yourself,  \u201cWhat are they really offering fir $73,000 a year?\u201d\n\nYears ago Babson built their reputation off their grad school when startups were the rage in the late 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s. Undergrad is a nice school but kids are not getting top offers at McKinsey or Bain Capital. That\u2019s quite possible at UVA. \n\nD3 sports and quiet suburban wealthy town with no stores open after 7 pm. 30% international kids roaring around in their Mercedes and Range Rovers. If you can drive through campus - it\u2019s open for a walk or bike ride.\n\nLastly, Babson has a new president and increasing enrollment is a big concern. The last president was a former politician and the new man is from an unknown school. Check out his background. By contrast, Bentley has a new President but she came from Univ of Michigan and  is really changing everything on campus - some good, some concerns but she understands what the best companies in the world expect if her kids are going to get recruited. College is a huge investment so really weigh what you will get for your efforts. \n\nTalk to as many alums or current students as you can but most kids around here would kill to go to UVA! Good luck! \n\nP.S.  I am not trying to bash Babson - it offers a solid regionally known business education - just trying to give you a different perspective as I see admissions people really pushing hard to recruit kids this year.",

I'm a prospective student and while it seems like everyone agrees Babson is one of the best colleges for entrepreneurship, I'm seeing a lot of mixed opinions regarding any other career prospects or paths besides that. Thoughts? How does Babson's reputation/career opportunities compare to schools like Northeastern or NYU beyond entrepreneurship?",

Reputation-wise, Babson has an excellent reputation within New England, and is fairly well known in NYC, then drops of a bit but still is somewhat known in FL, CA, and WA. NYU Stern is going to be more well known than Babson and can\u2019t speak to it\u2019s program, but it\u2019s going to be more of a large school experience, probably won\u2019t have the opportunity to get to know professors etc. NorthEastern, everyone will just ask if you meant NorthWestern.",

It doesn\u2019t have to be a party school but we are located in Wellesley and there are no college bars and the parties can feel really corny. I would recommend going to a school that is closer to a town with some form of nightlife",

If you have money to spend, then you can join people clubbing downtown but ubers are $30-50 one way and table service is like $800. Also there are some poker games. Course Requirements during your first 2.5 years remove a lot of choice in class selection. Imo if you want fun, explore elsewhere. Babson is a lot of marketing and not a very helpful administration. It\u2019s frustrating. Gn",

If you\u2019re fine with drinking with friends and partyhopping, then Babson is a fine environment to fuck around in. Ask any sophomore next year about Park Manor Central and they\u2019ll probably fill you in on the shit we\u2019ve done here.",

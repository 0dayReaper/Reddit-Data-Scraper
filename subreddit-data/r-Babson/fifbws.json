I do not have any inside information to support it: Those who declined after being placed on a waitlist must be because they were accepted to another institution equally or more prestigious. If this is true, on average, they should hold better credentials than the 660 that took the waitlist status. So 660 is your universe and you would have a 20% chance to get accepted in a pool of students from the lower 40% of the 1,676. \n\nGO FOR IT, Babson College is a great school.",

It worked.  Make sure they know you love the school, it\u2019s your top pick and if pulled off the list you will be there immediately to enroll.",

Parties are probably about what you'd expect from a small school... Lots of groups (friend groups, sports teams, frats, special interest orgs) will throw their own parties and sometimes they're open and other times they're not. Kinda just gotta feel it out. International students usually go off campus and go to clubs. It's very normal here to have a fake ID. A lot of parties are in pretty small rooms because there isn't really proper space to have a big party. This might've answered nothing, not sure lol",

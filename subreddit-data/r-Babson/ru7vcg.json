I got accepted ED last month but for me I didn\u2019t have to apply for interview as it was kinda mandatory for me.\nResponse will be a bit later, since first the ED-2 applicants will have their interviews. And advice, they will ask you general questions about your high school life, some activities you enjoyed, the classes you took, adjectives to describe yourself, a famous celebrity you look up to and why, some questions about Entrepreneurship and your family.",

            "comment": "Long time interviewer - most important tip is be yourself!! I love when prospective students tell me about their passions/hobbies/things they want to explore in college over telling me every single accolade that admissions already knows about. Tell me about how you feel about recent events. Tell me how you want to grow your perspective. The point of the interview is to provide more meaningful information to admissions to help make your application decision. \n\nAlso, have questions ready for the interviewer! I usually give 10 minutes of questions (ie: study abroad, greek life, clubs &amp; orgs, classes, etc.) and then 5 minutes for safe space/real-talk about Babson (things that I won't pass along to admissions that should help you see if Babson is going to be a good fit for you!)",

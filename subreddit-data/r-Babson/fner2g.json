As someone else mentioned, Babson focuses on teaching an entrepreneurial mindset, which is a flexible, creative, holistic way of approaching problems in any context.  It's not just for people who want to start their own business (only a minority of Babson students do that right after graduation). You can have an entrepreneurial mindset within a larger organization as well.",

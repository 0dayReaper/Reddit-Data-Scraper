    "postText": "Hi guys. I was recently waitlisted as a freshman for the class of 25. Since Babson only has 600 admits per class (according to their acceptance letter my girlfriend received). I wanted to know how many waitlisted applicants might be there, what are the chances of waitlisted students getting in, how many waitlisted students could they possibly accommodate and whether an official date for the announcement of results has been released ?",

    "postText": "Transfer sophomore here, just needed to bring something to attention in case anybody else noticed it too. But after transferring to Babson, which I thought was an amazing school, I've noticed that many of the classes are really useless. Took a QTM2000 course and it turned out to be just analyzing generated graphs for an entire semester. Many of my friends say that a lot of classes at Babson follow the same pattern, where professors put in little to no effort and students walk out not learning a thing.\n\nIsn't this weird? Like why are so many classes being allowed to operate like this, where professors get away with providing a really poor quality of education. I know some classes are great, but there's a lot of these really bad ones too\n\nAny opinions on this? And coming back to the title is there a student org where these issues can be raised?",

I would say the junior and senior classes, the ones that are concentration specific, are much more valuable. You also need to do some diligence on your professors before signing up for a class. Use the student surveys and rate my professor. \n\nAlso, Babson is a business focused college. Accounting, finance, business analytics, marketing, etc. are the subjects that will have better classes and professors. People that consider going here for things like computer science or math in general aren\u2019t going to have a great experience.",

                    "comment": "I agree that if you come here for computer science or pure mathematics that\u2019s a downright stupid move. \n\nHowever, I see three problems even as a business school. Firstly, you always need basic mathematics as a part of the curriculum unless you\u2019re maybe a pure arts student. Calc 1 should be either a requirement or at least an offered course. There\u2019s no reason for it to not be offered at a top school especially when math and logic are the two most important skill sets when you graduate. \n\nSecondly, even it\u2019s business courses are seriously lacking. If you get a data analytics degree at Babson, you\u2019re gonna be miles behind in technical skills. You\u2019re supposed to know how to code when you take data analytics, I\u2019ve taken 3 courses and not a single line of code has been taught. Marketing from what I hear was also a joke, all quizzes on quizlet so professors put below average effort and students still walk out with a good grade.\n\nThird, if it\u2019s a business focused school, why do we have to waste 2 years out of 4 taking absolutely irrelevant liberal art courses. I get writing 1&amp;2, and a few extra on top, but we\u2019re literally swamped with the most unnecessary requirements. Id much rather replace those requirements and take more of my concentration courses. There are very few of the business concentrations that are actually worth taking",

Other than that, don't think there's too much you can do other than to advise RateMyProfessor or ask around before selecting a professor's course. Wish this subreddit was more alive so that we can be wary of which classes to take/not take.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, can I ask which AQM2000 professor you're referring to? It's Troughton, isn't it?",

            "comment": "Qtm is particularly terrible, but I totally agree with your sentiment. I literally go through this sub to warn people not to come here, but they don\u2019t fucking listen. I used to be a huge stats nerd back in high school. So, when I was so disappointed by qtm in year one, I went to my advisor and then she suggested I meet with the math department head, so I did. The guy was clearly stressed outta his fucking mind when I brought it up and he said something along the lines of \u201cwe have a budget that we need to work with and I know I know I know it\u2019s not ideal\u201d Honestly, I felt bad for him so I just left.\n\nAvoid taking any SES courses w 2 professors too. Those are the worst and they just made them a requirement. The student feedback surveys were just a few leading questions like \u201cwhat did you like the most?\u201d \u201cWhat was most interesting?\u201d And didn\u2019t offer space to say negative stuff.\n\nYou can talk to SGA and admin and make effort, but really they won\u2019t fucking listen and you will end up more frustrated. It would be really hard to rally a big group of students together too because so many people are passive and hate anything hard or challenging tbh. I went to the accreditation panel meeting (happens once a decade) and talked about the problems with our math courses and other stuff and hopefully that gets included in the report and then hopefully some important people see that, but whatever. Administrators couldn\u2019t give less of a shit and you might drive yourself insane talking to them.\n\nDM if you wanna grab coffee and rant when we\u2019re back.",

I'm honestly tired of Babson pulling this shit with its classes, and nobody talks about it, its just swept under the carpet. \n\nAlso had a meeting with my dean for another course, I got referred to a department head, at which point communication just ceased. Honestly seems like Babson knows that this is a problem, but just turns a blind eye to it and focuses on advertising a #1 spot in entrepreneurship.",

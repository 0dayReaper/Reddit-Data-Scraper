(I personally think it was my PSs and my Why Babson essay that leveled up my application.) I think admissions is truly a mix of more than what your academics / ecs speak of you. I personally think Babson really does value an individual\u2019s creativity and desire in their vision of success. It\u2019s also just the class the admissions is trying to create that year, I wish you the best of luck! keep me updated :)",

I do get for entry level jobs they will primarily look to your business degree but a concentration shows its a field you care about and one in which you have deeper knowledge.   I also don\u2019t recall that you had to apply with a specific concentration but as noted you can change it.",

Concentrations are great for providing direction into what classes you should take if you are generally interested in a subject. I wouldn\u2019t let them pigeon hole you though. I wish I had taken an entrepreneurship class instead of financial markets &amp; instruments, which I needed to fulfill a finance concentration.",

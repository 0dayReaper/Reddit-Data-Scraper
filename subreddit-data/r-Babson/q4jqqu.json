    "postText": "Does Masters in Finance from Babson prepare you for a career in Private Equity?\n\nMy aim is to get into Private Equity but how much does this college have a track record of students getting into PE or investment banking; as most PE shops take in after 3-4 years of Investment Banking experience",

            "comment": "Most PE shops recruit first year bankers to start after they finish they second year or sooner. Babson is not a target school for bulge bracket investment banks but a decent number of alumni have still made it through from undergrad. Middle market and boutique banks you have a better shot, but that also limits the pool of PE shops you can then move to.\n\nI would say the curriculum is probably good enough to train you on the basics, but getting your foot in the door is the hard part. Your undergrad school and any work you did after graduating is going to also be important.",

I do not know for sure, but it is a pretty small community. I don\u2019t know if I would really call it a target name for PE especially. Investment banking is really common for undergrads. Again, I wouldn\u2019t say there is a lot of bb hiring. This is just the vibe I get, not hard data tho.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm looking to transfer to Babson next year. I'm starting at Rhode Island College this Monday and realized I've made a mistake choosing it. I'm looking to complete my first semester at Rhode Island College then apply to transfer for next year's fall semester. I want to tell you a bit about my self then ask for advice on my chances and what I can do to improve them.\n\n\\- High School GPA was 3.609 (I didn't realize how important grades were at the time)\n\n\\- SAT score of 1220\n\n\\- I'm starting a virtual tour business and actually have my first paying client this Monday \n\n\\- I've wrestled throughout high school and even won states once I also plan to wrestle my freshman year at Rhode Island College (Will this help at all?)\n\nIf anyone has any advice regarding ways to improve my chances of being accepted I would really appreciate it.",

With a similar  highschool/test profile (3.4/1250). \n\nI did however get over a 3.5 at Bryant, a comparable college, and having a strong first semester will be extremely important to your application. \n\nThey also asked for my spring mid-semester grades.",

Something that clearly demonstrates your interest in business, extra points if its entrepreneurship. \n\nTo emphasis though; the best thing you can do though to get accepted is to get As this semester. If you have tip top first semester grades, and good-enough scores you should be in good shape. Babson is a lot of work, so they like kids to demonstrate they can already thrive at a college level.",

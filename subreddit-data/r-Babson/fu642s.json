Can someone please explain to me how concentrations differ from majors and are babsoon concentrations different from concentrations in other universities? also why are there so many specific course listings under each subject? How does that work?",

            "comment": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello! I am currently a Babson senior and am happy to clarify this.\n\nAt Babson, there is one \u201cmajor\u201d, as in all undergraduate students graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA). Babson offers over 30 concentrations, both in business and in the liberal arts, for students looking to specialize in certain topics. For example, I will be graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) with a concentration in finance. Some popular concentrations include business analytics, marketing, entrepreneurship, finance, and strategic management. On the website, under each concentration, there are all the current course offerings listed for each concentration. To clarify your question, you are not expected to complete all of these classes. Generally, each concentration requires you to complete 4 of the courses listed. 1-2 may be required depending on the concentration, but generally the student can choose the ones they are most interested in. \n\nIn terms of other universities, many of the undergraduate B-schools like Babson offer the same one major, with the option to concentrate in zero, one, or two areas. Some schools, such as liberal arts colleges and large universities, offer separate majors in finance, business, marketing etc. \n\nYou are not required to choose a concentration, and many students choose not to concentrate. You also have a lot of time before choosing a concentration. Students can choose between 0-2 concentrations for their degrees. \n\nI hope this helps! Good luck with the rest of the college process!",

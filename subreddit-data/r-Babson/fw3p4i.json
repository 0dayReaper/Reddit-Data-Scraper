            "comment": "Hate to say the same thing everyone else says but it really depends on who you hang out with. There are students who go off campus with their friends Thursday afternoon, do ?, and return on Sunday. Upperclassmen and underclassmen alike who have soft get-togethers Thursday through Saturday. And the same for bigger parties (easier for upperclassmen because of accessibility to goods, connections, and housing location on campus). On occasion there\u2019s a party that a lot of people are talking about. So many in fact that when you get there the \u201cline\u201d (more like big blob) around the door is jammed; and you can barely move once you\u2019re inside. I find that the higher you go up in class level the less you\u2019ll care about these parties. Because parties will become way more accessible if you\u2019re into that sort of stuff, unless you have no/don\u2019t have the right type of friends; sorry.\n\nThere are school sponsored social events on occasion that are pretty much only fun if you \u201cpre-game\u201d them. Unless you like those types of things.\n\nAlso there\u2019s this place called the stoop (open space in front of frat dorms). The stoop is great. The stoop is terrible. Just picture a shitload of freshman 1/4 of them not sober. 3/4 of them trying to be like the others. And a whole bunch of upperclassmen almost always not sober. Yeah that\u2019s the stoop at the beginning of the year, dies down (for freshman) by November though. You\u2019ll learn more about it at the beginning and (apparently) the end of the school year.\n\nGood luck getting into the frat parties too, and if you get in enjoying your time there; (knowing upperclassmen there will help both). \n\nBest parties in my opinion are in upperclassmen common areas and/or suites. Usually just the right amount of people without the supervision of freshman common areas/dorm rooms.\n\nIn class, it\u2019s hit or miss socially. Could be a class where you hit it off with people you sit around but the class doesn\u2019t have a social environment. Or the exact opposite.\n\nDay to day campus you\u2019ll see someone you know and have to wave or say hi at least once a day. More if you know a lot of people. There are a few \u201cloners\u201d but most freshman will have their friend group or groups that they eat with or question about what the moves are for Thursday night. These groups are gonna evolve and devolve so much over the first few months. \n\nIf you\u2019re in sports then you\u2019re in luck, you\u2019d have to actively try to avoid the people on your team to not be best friends. Plus, your connection to upperclassmen on your team will give you a lot of advantages.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re probably going to see a lot of the same people around campus. If you know someone enough to recognize their face you\u2019ll start seeing them AT LEAST once a week in various places over campus.\n\nWrote a lot but in bored in quarantine right now so. Lmk if you have anymore questions.",

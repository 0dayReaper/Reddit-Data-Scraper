    "postText": "Hey everyone, \n\nI plan on applying to Babson as a transfer student. I will be transferring from a community college in California and I just wanted to know how I can get into Babson. \n\nI am extremely passionate about business and this is one of my top choices for transfer. Although I am just in my first quarter at my community college, I have been in contact with admissions at Babson. I was also told by admissions at Babson that I can apply after I am done with my first semester.\n\nHere is a little bit about me:\n- High School GPA was absolutely terrible and I was still trying to find myself. \n- College GPA right now is not yet established but I have 2 As and 1 B.\n- I have applied for a TEDx license and I plan on hosting the event in May.  \n- I have an idea to start my own business and have my business teacher mentoring me to execute it.\n- I am writing for a blog talking about women in the tech/business industry. \n- I am also working on becoming an intern at my campus student leadership committee.\n\nIf any of you have some tips for me, they will be deeply appreciated.

            "comment": "I think you have the correct motivations to be successful at Babson fron what you say. I think the biggest challenge you need to overcome is telling a story about yourself. Distance yourself from your high school gpa and come up with a genuine story of how you have changed, showing your new college gpa as evidence when you get it. Focus on expressing your entrepreneurial and business goals. ",

I'm just wrapping up my last year here.\n\nBabson is the best place to study business at the undergraduate level, for one reason only: the professors and administration give the you time and room to follow your passions. Homework load is relatively low (relative to other universities in the Boston area like Harvard/MIT/NEU/BU/BC), and nearly every class is focused on practical applications. \n\nAwesome re: TEDx and your own business, you'll fit right in here. You need to be 100% sure that you want to pursue business, but Babson's a dream come true for anyone with enough drive and follow-through to pursue their own venture or projects.\n\nHappy to answer specific questions as well ",

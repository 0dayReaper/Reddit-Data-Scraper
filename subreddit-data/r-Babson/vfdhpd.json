    "postText": "Hello ladies and gentlemen, so I\u2019m a high school sophomore going into Junior year fall 2022. I\u2019ve been looking for colleges and babson seems like a decent school I might consider going (new to the whole college process so kinda don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for). My question is should I do something or take a class to boost my application chances? I also saw the price tag and damn that\u2019s a lot so is there any financial help/things I can do you recommend I take to ease the burden?",

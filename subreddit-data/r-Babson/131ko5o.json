    "postText": "Hi I've been accepted into MSBA this fall semester and would like to get to know others who are coming as well. This sub is sort of dead but I can't seem find much resources for grad students.\n\nSince the college does not provide dorms for graduate students, we'll need to find off-campus housing. Do you know which area you're going to stay at? And I also understand commute from Boston is possible but could be a hassle since the commuter line stops quite far. I'm an international student who doesn't drive, so I'm a bit worried about this! Wondering if there's a facebook group for Babson students looking for roommates etc?",

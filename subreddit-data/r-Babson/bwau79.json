    "postText": "I am a Junior in High school and I go to school in Massachusetts. \n\n\n1. I\u2019ve seen some posts about FME being poorly run and hectic. Have others had similar experiences with FME? \n\n2. I would be very interested in the B.R.I.C program if I were to attend Babson. Is it a very competitive program to get into? \n\n\n3. I spend almost every one of my studies in school reading Babson reviews and exploring the Babson website. A trend I\u2019ve seen in reviews is that campus life isn\u2019t that fun or entertaining. I don\u2019t drink or do drugs, so I wouldn\u2019t be disappointed in Babson if it didn\u2019t have a lot of binge drinking parties, but I would like to know if you\u2019ve ever found yourself bored at Babson. \n\n\n4. Another trend I\u2019ve noticed is that many people have said that the coursework at Babson is very strenuous and some others have complained about the grading system. Did/ Do you find yourself overwhelmed by schoolwork at times? \n\n5. I participated in Model UN in highschool and I was able to interact with students from all across the world. Babson has a large international population and I was wondering how connected and included international and domestic student life was on campus. I would love to make friends with people from all across the world. \n\n6. Is the food at Babson really, \u201cMediocre at best\u201d? \n\n\n7. Do I have a disadvantage applying because I\u2019m an in state student?",

BRIC is great, not competitive if you have a decent GPA.\n3. You're living in the middle of the Boston suburbs, so it's going to get boring. Friends make it fun.\n4. I never spent more than an hour on homework every weekday and graduated with a 3.68. The classes are a joke if you pay attention during the lectures and pick the right professors.\n5. Very international (25%) and accessible if you're willing to branch out of comfort zone\n6. It's just fine, any food will get boring after 4 years, please don't pick which school you go to based on how their food is, there are so many more important things.\n7. Yes, likely, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't apply",

            "comment": "FME is hit or miss. It really depends on your group. Part of the experience is based upon managing different personalities and controlled chaos. I would not recommend the CEO role because it is much more work with little benefit. \n\nI\u2019m know familiar with BRIC admission, but I don\u2019t think it would be an issue to get in with good grades. \n\nBabson is in the middle of Wellesley which is a pretty quiet town. My best advice would be to find a friend group to entertain yourself or get out to Boston and explore. I think any college you go to, your friend group is what makes it fun. Parties are there if you want them but you don\u2019t have to participate. \n\nThe coursework depends on the classes you take and the professor. I didn\u2019t think the basic prerequisite classes were that challenging, but the more focused ones could be definitely be, especially if you pick a more difficult concentration. \n\nI was friends with lots of international students. They do tend to somewhat keep to themselves though. That\u2019s more of a class barrier I would say than a cultural one. \n\nThe food isn\u2019t great but it\u2019s passable. \n\nI don\u2019t think you have a disadvantage for being in state.",

Have a few interesting clubs and/or leadership roles with meaningful accomplishments. \n\nSet up an interview this fall  and ask interesting questions that are not easily found on their website. \n\nThey love full pay kids ( only about 45% apply for financial aid) so not checking the financial aid box will certainly help. They don\u2019t have a big endowment so ability to pay is important to admissions decisions.",

    "postText": "hi i got into babson early action this cycle\n\ni have a few questions Babson:\n\n1. how does the unbalanced male to female ratio affect dating at babson?\n2. how **objectively attractive** is the student body (compared to schools like ASU)? lol heard rumors abt this so just wondering\n3. is going into Boston 3x a week doable, especially if i don't have a car? can the subway take me to **copley place** within 45 minutes?\n4. How many colleges are near babson? do people typically date between colleges?\n5. what happens if i decide i don't want to pursue business while im at babson? do i have to transfer to another university, or are there other options?\n6. do you think the school is worth it considering the cost?\n\nI understand if some of these questions may come off as shallow or weird, sorry if they are offensive in any way lol. thanks",

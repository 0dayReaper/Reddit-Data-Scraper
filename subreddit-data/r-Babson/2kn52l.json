The venue is built for eSports with 2 soundproof booths and a commentator room for live streaming. We have held many semi-professional and amateur prize-money tournaments, but now are launching a College Division.\n\nThe College Division is strictly for college students and it is run just a like a sports league with weekly matches leading up to playoffs and a championship. Each school has one team and it is determined by tryouts to be sure the team has the best players. Dota and LoL are the two games featured. There is no cost to play in the league and the AVGL will do everything to help you run events at your school or start an officially recognized club! \n\nIf you are an interested player, fill out the form on the website [HERE](http://avglcollege.org)\n\nLet me know your thoughts and if you have any questions!",

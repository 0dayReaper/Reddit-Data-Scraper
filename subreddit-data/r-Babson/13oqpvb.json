    "postText": "I've heard so much positive babble about Babson College's outstanding entrepreneurship program, but amidst all this babble, I haven't found much about other areas of business. Can any Babson alumni or current students cut through the babble and provide some firsthand insight into how the school supports students who are interested in fields like finance, marketing, or international business? I'm trying to separate the meaningful insights from the general babble out there, so your detailed experiences would be greatly appreciated!",

The competition makes it intense, but if you can impress people, the student clubs in those areas bring in a lot of speakers or professional networking opportunities.\n\nI can't speak to the education itself, because I'm not in those fields, but I can speak to the energy of the students and their desire to network with other professionals. I think that's the big value of Babson if you're targeting the finance field or something similar.",

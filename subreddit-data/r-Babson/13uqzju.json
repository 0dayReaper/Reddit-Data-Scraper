    "postText": "Hello guys, I scored admission to both Babson (F.W. Olin Business School) and Northeastern (D'amore McKim School). Really confused about which one to choose, I see my future in a hedge fund as a financial analyst or getting into the IB-related streams. I was sure about Babson but their emphasis on the whole entrepreneurship is giving me some second thoughts as you see I wish to get some experience in the HF sector. Northeastern is in the main city plus it got the Co-op feature, but Babson says it has around 95% placement. This is very confusing please give any feedback if possible.",

If I\u2019m not wrong, the co-op feature does not necessarily mean you\u2019ll 100% get one and it\u2019s the same process as applying for internships. let me know what you decide on cus im also still really confused.",

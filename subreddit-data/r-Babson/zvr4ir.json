Most of the dorms as a freshman are fine though, Forest is near the dining hall, Trim. The manors are pretty central in lower campus so you can get to the library or Reynolds quickly. The only one that's inconvenient is probably Publisher's Hall. Its out of the way, and unless they updated it has small rooms and no AC.",

If/when you find a person you'll then both have to accept and request each other as roommates, this is to prevent a one sided request. Then they'll put you guys together. If you don't find a roommate I think they just assign a person to you.",

The courses are a great intro, but will not be enough to go into a SWE role out of college. If you are looking to be a Solutions Consultant, Product Manager or Business Analyst it will give you exactly the skills you need to do well in your job one day!\n\nIf you do enroll to Babson you can cross-register to Olin College of Engineering to take 1 engineering class per semester (or talk it out with your dean for a more custom plan), and Olin has a in depth CS program.",

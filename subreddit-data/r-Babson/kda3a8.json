    "postText": "Hi! I applied Early Action to Babson college and I have heavily expressed my interest in entrepreneurship and reached out to my admission counselor multiple times. I applied for no financial aid. I applied with no test scores. I have pretty good extracurriculars and I think my essay was pretty good. I am an out of state applicant. My freshman and sophomore year grades were not that good but my junior year and senior grades are good and all A's currently. I took one AP class my junior year and currently I am taking 3 AP classes my senior year of high school. My counselor told me my unweighted 4.0 GPA is 2.82, and my unweighted 5.0 GPA is 3.77. and finally my weighted 5.0 GPA is 4.18. Not 100% sure what it means and why there are 3 different scales but I would love to know if I even have a chance. I also did the optional interview which I thought went pretty well. I know I do not have the best stats but I am hoping they have seen my continued interest and will consider me. Results come out soon as well so I am a bit nervous but hoping for the best! Thank you!",

I'm an alum now and believe I made the right choice in choosing Babson to go to.\n\nI'm going to be honest here and say that what you shared so far does not seem competitive for Babson. \n\nWhile plenty of schools are now going test optional due to COVID, I think the general guidance/advice has been that it's still a good idea to submit scores particularly for schools that are more competitive since plenty of applicants will still be opting in to do so. \n\nWhile Babson doesn't release admitted students GPA stats generally folks that get accepted had mostly A's on their high school transcript and some B's usually in AP classes. If I had to take a guess I would assume that the Babson admitted student has an avg unweighted GPA of \\~3.5 to 3.7 on a 4.0 scale. Everyone I know personally so far below that range has not been accepted. Don't let this disuay you since admissions offices look at candidates holistically, so there may be aspects of your application that may work in your favor and make you as a stronger applicant. Keep us posted on the status of your application and best of luck!",

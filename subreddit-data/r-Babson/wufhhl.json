    "postText": "Hi! I recently toured Babson and have been talking with admissions and all and I\u2019m just in love with the school. I\u2019ve been told I meet their standards academically and athletically so I feel as if I can get in. I just have a few questions if anyone is interested:\n\n1) How is the commute to Boston proper? Is it difficult to hang out/find somewhere to eat off campus?\n2) How are the dorms?\n3) How is the food?\n4) How are the people there? \n\nI\u2019d love to chat with anyone who\u2019d be willing to (:",

            "comment": "im an alumni 20 or so years out of babson, so i dont know how relevant my experience will be to you, but here goes.\n\ncommute to boston is pretty easy via public transportation, but it takes a while.  commuter rail is closer to campus, but ends service earlier.  the green line runs later, but you'll need to get a ride or catch a cab to the station.  you can have a car on campus, that helps a LOT.  just as an example, i had a friend at brandeis (waltham) and it took me 2 hours to get there by public transport and like 20 minutes by car.\n\nits not very difficult to find places to hang out off-campus, or to find great food.  im sure there's even more options now than there were when i was a student.  \n\nthe dorms were fine.  babson is pretty good with updating the quality of housing on a regular basis.  that being said, your living situation improves with seniority, as you become eligible to live in single rooms, as opposed to with roommates.  my first and second years i had 2-3 roommates (which was fine because we ended up becoming great friends, even still), but thats not always the case with roommates.  you are pretty free to set up your living space however you like, we had no issues with lofting our beds to make more living space in the room.\n\nthe food was good when i was there.  main dining hall closes pretty early at around 8pm, so if you miss that window youre either relegated to reynolds or ordering out.  not sure what the options are at reynolds these days, but im sure there are more options than when i was a student. lol\n\nthe people...its a small school (slightly more students than my HS had), and tended to be fairly cliquey in my time.  there was some social life, but you had to join an organization to really feel \"involved\" with the fun scene.  whether thats a bad thing depends on how you feel about that.  some people were douchebags, others were really cool.  i never really felt ostracized or bullied, but i cant speak for everyone.  there's a fairly large international student body, but i cant say the general population was very diverse...maybe thats changed in the last 20 years.  the social class of the majority of students was definitely upper-middle and higher, if that makes sense.  its a business school, and it attracts people interested in making money, so there can be a sense of entitlement with many of the students.  but, again, thats not everyone, and the business world isn't the same as it was either.  so take my feedback with a grain of salt.\n\nthe curriculum was second to none.  thats the best part about babson.  you learn by doing from the very beginning.  the workload is difficult and can be stressful, but worth it in the end.",

            "comment": "You can drive or take the commuter rail or subway. I\u2019d check google maps for a more in depth look at commute times. People pay a lot of money to live in Wellesley for the commuting ability (among other things). In my opinion it was far enough away to not be a distraction but accessible enough if I wanted to go. \n\nThere are good places to eat off campus if you have a car. The Local is one of my favorites. Cafe fresh is good too. \n\nThe dorms have improved a lot over the last 5 years for freshmen. Upper class living is average I would say. \n\nFood varies greatly. Average to below average for the main dining hall meal plan. There is an ala carte cafeteria in Reynolds\u2019s which was pretty good. \n\nPeople are fun depending on what group you find. Maybe slightly above average competitiveness/type A personality, but you probably get that with any business school. Lots of international students. Like 30%+",

If you don\u2019t mind, just to follow up; \n\nYou mentioned good places to eat if you have a car, is it common or possible for freshmen to have cars? I also saw the T/Subway mentioned on the babson website, is that something convenient for students to use?\n\nI\u2019m glad the students personalities aren\u2019t too posh I was kinda worried lol. I\u2019d be worried about not making friends in a competitive environment but seeing as I\u2019d probably be on an athletic team that shouldn\u2019t be as much of a problem.\n\nThanks so much, man. Idk if you\u2019re a current student or alum or what but you\u2019re super helpful (:",

For a lot of them, it solidified their decision in applying to Babson. It\u2019s a great opportunity to meet students and learn more about the programs Babson has to offer. \n\nAs for starting a business, something like 10% of students start a business right out of college. This number is significantly higher than a lot of other business schools. Babson has a ton of resources to help you start your own company. Profs and alumni are super easy to get in contact with and they\u2019re always happy to help you with pretty much anything business related. I\u2019ve only been here two months and have been able to meet a bunch of student entrepreneurs, too. \n\nI really can\u2019t speak for the stuff about finance majors, though. \n\nIf you decide to come for MOE, message me and I\u2019d be happy to meet up with you and show you around.",

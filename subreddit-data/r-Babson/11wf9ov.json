    "postText": "Hi, i\u2019ll be joining Babson as a grad student in the MSEL program this fall.\n\nI heard living on/near campus is boring and the commute from Boston isn\u2019t bad - but what about regularly? I\u2019d rather live in Boston and commute 45 mins morning and evening. \n\nI see the commuter line from Wellesley Hills to South Station takes about 30 mins, however the issue seems to be the walk from Wellesley Hills to campus, read that it\u2019s uphill and over a mile, not doable in the winter.\n\nAre there buses or shuttles from Wellesley Hills station to Campus?",

You\u2019ll be commuting 30ish mins on the train to the Wellesley Hills stop, then an additional 15/20ish min walk to the Grad School. So door to door could be an hour plus and you\u2019ll have to plan your entire day around the train schedule. FYI the train is fine when it runs well, but the MBTA melts down a lot and it\u2019ll ruin your day.",

Wellesley Sq is slightly closer to Wellesley vs Wellesley Hills to Babson but after utilizing/waiting for the shuttle it\u2019ll likely take longer than just walking from Wellesley Hills especially if you need to wait/just missed it. The US is extremely car dependent even just outside major cities, and I suspect you\u2019ll likely get very tired of commuting 3+ hours a day. If you\u2019re very determined to live in Boston, the one other option I know of is taking the MWRTA from the Woodland Green Line stop, it\u2019s an on-demand bus that works like Uber, but I don\u2019t know how reliable it is. You can read up on it here: https://mwrta.com/catch. If you\u2019re lucky you may find someone in your program or an MBA that lives close to you that you could carpool with, and if not you can get a car.",

The walk to the train indeed sucks and it definitely not 15min. It's 30min. Wellesley College is further.\n\nI mean I used to walk 30min to work from campus but I imagine it would be draining waking up so early to commute. You'll probs end up ubering which adds up. But you know your limits better than I do!",

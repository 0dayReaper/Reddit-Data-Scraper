The whole spirit of the school is to know what you want and what you're capable of and using your resources to make those things happen. So a lot of the people here were super involved in high school. They may have had a business (or three!) or were super passionate about a cause and spent a lot of their time doing that. Babson really just wants to see proof of passion and determination and decent grades!",

There are one or two merit / essay based scholarships that can be awarded to international students covering up to full ride. Early round applicants (EA/ED) are considered for the scholarships as well as RD applicants. Which means early round applicants have an advantage over the number in the pool of applicants that might be eligible for a scholarship.",

I'd say over a third of the student body concentrates in finance. We have an amazing investment banking program that is a fantastic introduction into the industry. I myself am planning on concentrating in accounting and there are so many opportunities to work in that industry through Babson's career center even before I graduate. I have met multiple students who already work full time in the industry in their senior year. Almost the entire student body does multiple paid internships in their desired field before they graduate. Two thirds of the student body also study abroad for a period of time. Overall, if you're thinking of doing anything in the realm of business, Babson will get you there.",

Is it the funding opps, professors expertise, or something else?\n\n3) What is the campus like, genuinely? Will I enjoy walking from class to class and is there a good gym?",

They also have institutes that specialize in different areas of entrepreneurship like family entrepreneurship, women entrepreneurs, global entrepreneurship, etc. There's also the Weissman foundry that is available to all students to use for personal projects as well.\n\nCampus is small, but not too small, walking end to end would take 10-15 minutes depending on speed. We have a really nice gym in my opinion, especially for a division 3 school. It has pretty much anything you'd want in a gym. There are also basketball courts, a pool that has free swimming, and a skating rink.",

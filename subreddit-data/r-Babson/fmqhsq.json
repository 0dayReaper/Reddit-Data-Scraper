    "postText": "Babson was one of my top picks, but it's just so EXPENSIVE, so I wanted to make sure before I make my final decision.   \nI am planning on going into economics, with no set career path, and I'm not really interested in entrepreneurship, so would Babson still be a good fit? \n\nOnline many people talked about building relationships with the professors, is it easy to build the relationships? I'm generally a really quiet person. \n\nHow are the classes like at Babson? I head Babson was really competitive, but on what level?   \nI have more questions, but kind of forgot them. Ahaha.",

            "comment": "Babson is still a great choice, as long as you have an interest in business. Our school pushes thinking entrepreneurially so you don't have to be a startup guy to fit in. In fact, the majority of people at Babson don't end up founding companies (while a handful do). Most of my friends are into marketing/it, finance, consulting, strategy, etc. Classes are really small and Babson professors are hella chill and want you to participate in class. Babson professors are super accessible as well because almost everyone holds office hours frequently. Classes at Babson can be a lot of work, but I wouldn't say they are competitive. Peers usually help each other out and everyone has a shared sense of community. PM if you have more questions!",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019ve recently been accepted into babson college for entrepreneurship and NYU for their real estate program at SPS. I\u2019m really conflicted between the two schools because they both have their pros and cons but end up balancing out when you weigh both sides. This is what I\u2019ve come up with through my college website and reddit/quora research.\n\nthe main pro i have for babson is that i love their curriculum and how it genuinely provides hands-on experience for students (i.e. entire courses based on creating real businesses that generate real profit). When a babson alumni interviewed me during the admissions process, he told me that by the time he\u2019d graduated undergrad, he had already started like four or five businesses with lots of support and funding from babson. He also said that one of his friends were able to sell their business for millions right after college which basically made him a self-made millionaire by the age of 23 or smth like that. i mean, where else would you get an education like that! one that genuinely prepares you for the real world instead of listening to lectures every week! \n\none of it\u2019s cons is that i\u2019ve heard the social life there isn\u2019t great. i know most people say that it is what u make of it and u just need to find your people but babson is such a small school! there are only 500 people in each grade so it\u2019ll feel similar to high school and there\u2019s a much slimmer chance I\u2019ll be able to find people with the same interests and hobbies. I could join greek life (which i\u2019m seriously considering) since most people who are looking to go to parties and make friends join it but i\u2019m worried I\u2019ll be surrounded by people who only want to have fun and don\u2019t take their education seriously (this is probably just a stereotype but idk pls lmk)\n\nI\u2019m definitely someone who loves going out with friends and social/party scene is an important aspect of consideration/my life but i\u2019m also very driven and ambitious. I take my education and goals very seriously and i\u2019m not looking to waste 4 years of my life drunk at frat parties.\n\nNYU, however, sounds like the perfect school for me, culturally speaking. I love going out clubbing/bar hopping (i have a fake), i love the city life, i love fashion/art/film, i love how international/diverse the school is etc. At NYU, i won\u2019t have to search really hard for only 1-2 friends who have the same interests as me, the general culture will allow me to be surrounded by lots of similar people. \n\nAnother point is that i love the city life and babson is quite secluded. This isn\u2019t that important since i could just travel to boston on the weekends if i go to babson but i thought i\u2019d just put it out there. also nyu doesn\u2019t have a campus which id prefer wasn\u2019t the case but i honestly don\u2019t care enough for it to sway my decision.\n\nA con for NYU is that since I\u2019ve applied, i\u2019ve realised that real estate may not 100% be what i want to pursue in the future. I know i definitely want to go into business but im not sure which specific field yet. Going to NYU will get me a bachelors in real estate which wouldn\u2019t be as generally applicable as the bachelors in business I\u2019d get from babson. Also I heard the the NYU SPS college is kind of a joke compared to the other schools like stern n tisch. It\u2019s sort of seen like the liberal core course which people look down on (apparently). I know i shouldn\u2019t care about stereotypes but they\u2019re stereotypes for a reason, it\u2019s generally true. I could resolve this by trying to transfer after my first year at NYU or applying for a duel degree but there\u2019s no guarantee i\u2019d get it. Also, it\u2019s still not as hands-on as babson.\n\nPlease give me your opinions or personal experiences or literally just tell me what to do. I think I\u2019d end up being happy at either schools so everything will turn out fine but i still need to pick one!! please help me!!!\n\ntldr:\nI don\u2019t know if I should go to Babson College or NYU. I prefer babson\u2019s curriculum but NYU\u2019s social life. What should i do?",

The social scene here I think is fantastic, while it is true you won\u2019t be going to 1000 person frat parties there are really good people here and really fun parties!",

That being said my friends that went to boarding school do say it is very similar.",

Babson makes an honest attempt at incorporating entrepreneurship into many classes, but more than likely you will end up in some kind of business, finance, accounting, etc role. \n\nPersonal presence on suburban vs city. I liked having the option to go into the city, and have peace and quiet most of the time. Wellesley doesn\u2019t have a popping night life but it has good restaurants. Some students lived off campus in Boston and commuted in.",

            "comment": "Certain dorms have their own perks while others are just bad. West is the biggest for freshman, has a pool table and the market that closes late. Central and west have the most dorm parties for freshmen but they die down pretty quick into the semester. The park manor dorms are basically center of campus. South has a really good location and is silent. For the bad dorms there is park manor north because it has mostly quads and no air conditioning. Forrest is too far away but has a medium amount of people. Mattos is easily the worst because its too far from everything and is small. \n\nThere is trim which is the main and only dining hall and basically where youll be eating most meals. Although other buildings have food like reys has dunkin, a market, create, and burger 781. The library also has starbucks.\n\nIf you were expecting \"the college experience\" then get into greek life, join a sports team, or be prepared to go into boston for the night life every weekend. Other than that its going to be a lot more difficult to get into parties or throw them. At the beginning stoop will be fun but gets old quick into the semester. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFocus on grades. Babson deflates grades and although you may be easily above 50%ish of babson students by having barely above a 3.0, job recruiters dont know that babson deflates and if they did they dont care. Unless you have a good family business that you are 100% dead set on working in, dont let first semester freshmen year fuck up your gpa. Even putting yourself in the situation of needing to raise your gpa when youre an upperlcassman is really dumb because internships look at your gpa when youre in freshman, sophomore, and junior year.",

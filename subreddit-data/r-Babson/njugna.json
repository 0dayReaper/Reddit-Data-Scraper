Around when I was applying I believe Babson's full SAT range was from about 1250 to 1410. I'm not sure if the score ranges you've also found are around that range. If you're confident in your score and it's outside the 25% mark I would say send. If not, I feel that Babson understands, since it's a pandemic, and you can always make up for it in your essays and grades.",

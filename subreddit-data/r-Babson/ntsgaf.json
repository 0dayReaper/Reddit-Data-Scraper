    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI am a prospective Babson student in the class of 2025. I am aware that it is possible for Babson students to take courses from Olin, but I was wondering whether it is possible to do a double major, one at Babson and one at Olin\n\nI have found this page: [https://www.bow3colleges.org/degree-programs](https://www.bow3colleges.org/degree-programs)  which states it is possible for Wellesley students. I was wondering whether you are aware of any similar program for Babson students.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Olin offers an \"engineering certificate\" for Babson students and Babson offers a \"Technology, Entrepreneurship, and Design\" degree where you have to take Olin science coursework. The requirements for these two overlap and I plan to do both. In fact, I chose Babson over USC for these reasons. Despite both being great schools for both the engineering/business path, I liked this double whammy Babson/Olin offered. Also the Wiessman foundry gives ya free range to do whatever science-y project suits your fancy, just don't try to 3d print a gun cause someone tried to do that a few years back (allegedly).",

I love babson and some people I know have gotten in who don\u2019t even want to study business. It hurts man. I know another person who got in because they can pay full tuition. They have no EC\u2019s and the same grades as me. They don\u2019t even have a business passion :(.",

It\u2019s not that crucial for Ivy League as they have a different mission and enormous endowment. Babson is awesome but they are a business so they need to pay salaries, build campus parts, taxes and other expenses. Public colleges are not allowed to reject based on need as they are sponsored by government and fulfill student need locally.",

Unfortunately Babson does not have an endowment to give out to students as much. College is still a business they need full pay kids to cover their expenses. It\u2019s fine tho!!! You will find something better",

Of course I might be mistaken but from what I saw that some brilliant students were rejected when requested financial aid while some lower students got in due to the ability to pay full tuition?

I had an interview with an admissions officer over the phone, visited several times, and attended their fly in (they pay for your visit to the school &amp; you stay overnight) Usually the fly-ins are geared towards low income &amp; URMs so I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t discriminate THAT MUCH towards lower income students though. \n\nJust my thinking &amp; experience, but I\u2019m probably 100000% incorrect lol colleges only have limited endowment to offer towards scholarships. \nI haven\u2019t gotten my financial aid package yet tho rip",

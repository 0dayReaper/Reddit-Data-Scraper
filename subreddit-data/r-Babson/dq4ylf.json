            "comment": "My interview was super relaxed. Honestly, I don't think the interviewers influence admissions decisions unless the interview goes very bad. I would say to know your life story. Know the reason *why* you want to go to Babson and back it up. Talk about the instant that made you realize you wanted to go to Babson. Also, have 3 questions for your interviewer so that they can act as buffers if the conversation becomes a bit dead, and you want to pick it up again. Also, look up your interviewer. You may have something in common with them. Read an article about Babson's definition of entrepreneurship. For some reason, from the people I have spoken to that did interviews, they like to ask this question. They may be going into a field you want to go into, and they're an easy LinkedIn connection if the conversation goes well.\n\nIf it's on campus.\n\n1. Wear appropriate clothing. There are people who have come to campus for an interview in their Harvard/Penn/whatever sweatshirt. Stay away from college sweatshirts in general.\n2. Arrive 10 to 15 minutes early at least.\n\nAlso, just general things if your interview is online.\n\n1. Have your laptop/phone/tablet charged before your call.\n2. Make sure your laptop/phone/tablet is propped properly so your interviewer can see your face.\n3. Be in a place where there is natural light.\n4. Wear appropriate clothing for the online interview as well. One horror story is that once, a friend of mine had a college interview, and wore an appropriate top for it. They didn't have any pants on in the bottom. When their interview ended, they closed the call, and got up, but it turns out the face of the interviewer was paused and the screen was paused. The interviewer could see them in their underwear, and my friend heard the audio of the interviewer saying \"What the...\". Anyway, they didn't get into that school.",

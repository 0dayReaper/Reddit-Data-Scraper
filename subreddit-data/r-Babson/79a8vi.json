People are pretty driven to achieve here but also like to have there fun. School spirit is more of an afterthought at Babson, but its there if you want it. I think more people care about the prestige of the school and how it can help them get a job moreso than the football team (which we don't have). That being said, our basketball team won the d3 national championship. I'm not sure if that helps with your individualist/collectivist question. \n\nI would come here if you can't get into an ivy and are mostly sure that you want to go into business with a very good chance of getting a job when you graduate.\n\nDo you know what you want to do?\n\n",

My reasoning  for going to Babson is because I couldn't figure out what I wanted to do as a career, and Babson seems like the type of place where I could learn about business and other things, and combine them somehow. I've thought about finance and economics, but I like Babson because the stress is entrepreneurship and I would like to be a self-employed business owner one day. I just don't know where to start, but Babson seems like the type of place to figure that out.\n",

            "comment": "hey, im an international student and got accepted for EA yesterday. I\u2019m not sure how different ED is to EA regarding the decision and level of merit you need to get in but my advice would be to request an interview if you haven\u2019t already. I\u2019m not sure if they entertain interviews for RD but i know for me it did help as it shows your interest in the school. Another thing would be to have a really creative why babson essay. I looked up samples prior to writing mine and you\u2019ll find that it isn\u2019t a typical \u201cwhy this college\u201d essay and requires more creativity and personalization. Lastly, try and participate in extra curriculars and internships relevant to whatever concentration you want to pursue. Hope this helps :)",

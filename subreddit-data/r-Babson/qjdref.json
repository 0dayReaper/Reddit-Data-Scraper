These people were really special and I honestly do not see their personalities replicated in the younger classes. If you love spending money and playing poker, then you'll manage to have a fun time. Personally, I expected a richer creative scene in \"Babson TV\" (non-existent) and \"Babson Radio\" not really active. I love my business classes, but there are plenty of bs requirements. Very poor quality 100 and 200 level math courses. If you like STEM/STEAM topics - do not come here IMO &lt;3",

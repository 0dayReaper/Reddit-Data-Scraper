Update them on what you've been up to your senior year besides just what's on your common app. \n\nHere's a good video I watched after getting deferred: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ycruts18qqU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ycruts18qqU) \n\nFeel free to dm, I'm open to talking more about this",

I was wondering after reading some stats on google stating that Babson admitted only 1 person from waitlist out of around 1200 for class of 2026 , that makes me so demotivated and reduced my hopes of getting in .",

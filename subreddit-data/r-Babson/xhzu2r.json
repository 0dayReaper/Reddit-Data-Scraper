    "postText": "Hello, I'm a high-school junior already searching for colleges and I want to major in business and minor in CS, I know that Babson only offers one major, business management, and that you can take up 2 concentrations, so my question is shown deep does that concentration go into programming and how deep does it go into math? I'm planning on applying either way but this is to know whether I should ED or not.",

I took enough courses to qualify for 3 concentrations by the time I graduated. \nI would also recommend taking classes in the Information Technology Management track. It will cover some CS concepts and focuses on giving you the exposure to the skills recruiters are looking for on your resume in fields like Product Management, Technical Consulting, IT Project Management, Business Systems Analysis, etc.",

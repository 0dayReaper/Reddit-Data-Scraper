    "postText": "Please say it is not...\n\nLiterally, I am freaking worried rn about my future after I graduate from Babson...seriously...\n\nI understand Babson is a non-target school for IB, Finance/Accounting, and Big three firms. And job recruiting is not that active in this school so most of the students have to start from the bottom to get their summer internships, entirely on themselves, for only small to middle scaled companies. Internships at famous, well-known companies are never happenning. \n\nbut why are they making us pay $76,000 every year for the cost of attendance then?\n\nTuition is expensive as twice as compared to other colleges but getting way lower income?\n\nAlumni of US top-ranked 50 colleges usually get AT LEAST $60K as an entry salary if they worked hard during college\n\nOne American girl I know from Babson who was very hardworking &amp; talented only got $45k as their entry salary at one mediocre investment banking... she opened her new venture but it seems not going well.\n\nThat means if u put 100% of your effort here, it doesn't come back\n\nI would say going to Penn State, U of T, and Northeastern are much much better choices in every part...\n\nOkay, other than getting a job, what about entrepreneurship?\n\nI looked up Google and I found out there was a significantly low number of ppl who are running successful ventures. That means this school doesn't even produce successful startup CEOs. I was pretty shocked. I would say Babson's entrepreneurship is way lower ranked than top-tiered colleges whose students could easily get funding from VCs.\n\nThey keep advocating for themselves as the no.1 entrepreneurship but I cannot see the result. Never heard of any recent success stories. Can anyone please bring them up? I couldn't find the link for that.\n\nWhy are they keep advocating that they're no.1 in entrepreneurship for 30 consecutive years and ruining many students' lives? Just to get money?\n\nLiterally, I'm crying so much these days because of this fact. Is it my fault to be conceived by the fake marketing of this school?\n\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong... and please say they're all wrong. The horrible return of the tuition and 4 years of time compared to its reputation are certainly unreasonable\n\nAnd do Babson students usually network with Wellsely and Olin school of engenerring using the partnership program? Is it working well?  \n\nOr any cases of transfers to other colleges you've ever seen? Thank you",

            "comment": "For one, breathe. No school is worth crying over. \n\nThe 40-50k range may be for certain industries, I'm not sure, but Babson has always said the starting salary for their students is a bit above 62k on average. This will obviously vary with some industries being higher and others being lower. In all honesty though, who's to say you can trust the school's stats until you actually start doing internships and working to get a job yourself. A school name will only take you so far, at some point you'll have to put in the work and get a job yourself.\n\nI'm a rising junior currently and have an upcoming internship salarying at 64k annually (~$30/hr.) Other people I know have internships within the $26 - $32+/hr range. I'm sure there are people lower or higher than this as well.\n\nIn terms of the entrepreneurship aspect, I can't tell you much there. I personally didn't come here with any intentions of building a business and know some others who haven't as well. Most people concentrate in finance here anyway. I know the school does promote events for people who want to do so however. I'm pretty sure there's a Babson fund you can apply for to help with starting up businesses, they have many competitions for startups, can apply to go to conferences on it ,etc. etc. I don't say this to suck up to Babson and say it's fair to pay 76k a year because it is absolutely ridiculous without a doubt. I'm also sure that other top schools have many resources similar to this as well without a hefty price tag.\n\nUltimately up to you on how you perceive this. Just don't want you to cry over a school that may or may not be healthy for you. If you feel it isn't, take your own health in to account and reevaluate if its worth staying.\n\nSorry for any formatting issues, am on mobile.",

            "comment": "Hey friend, you seem very stressed out about this. I get it, college is a big time investment and a big financial investment. Now granted I\u2019m in my 30s, so Babson is a pretty different place now than when I went, but there are a few things that are universally true. \n\n1) College is what you make of it. You seem overly concerned with rankings, salaries, etc. Those are all averages and all what people report. There are people I graduated with making $60k and there are people making $600k. And that\u2019s true of every college in America. Make the most out of your time there and you\u2019ll get a lot in return. \n\n2) Entrepreneurship isn\u2019t just one thing. There are all sorts of different types of \u201centrepreneurs\u201d. Personally I\u2019ve never started my own company, but I\u2019ve been an early stage (first 10) employee at 3 different startups. Most people who do eventually start a company work at a few beforehand to figure out what they want. \n\n3) Finally, there are what, 2000 students at Babson? Even if every one of them started a company, the likelihood of you knowing any of their companies is low. Just because you don\u2019t find many household names that are started by Babson grads doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t any. \n\nDon\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions, but right now you should know: you\u2019re fine. You\u2019re not making a mistake. You will make more than that much money out of school.",

I agree with you that Babson is a bad investment (graduated in \u201818 and went into tech, nobody cares where I went to school). I found classes dull, antiquated, and mostly useless.",

Tons of kids pay $75k to go OOS to my college, and for some it works out well, but others it just seems reckless. \n\nAt the end of the day college is a purchase just like buying an expensive car. If you can afford it, great, but there's plenty of other cars out there much cheaper than can also get you from point A to point B.",

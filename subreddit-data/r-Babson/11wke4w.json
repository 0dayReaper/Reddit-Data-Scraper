    "postText": "Hi all, I recently got accepted into Babson in the Early Action program. When I originally submitted my early transcript, I had mostly A's and A-'s. I then submitted my mid year transcript, where I again had basically all A's apart from a B in AP Calculus AB. It is now nearing the end of the year and due to the teacher and me struggling in the class it looks like I will end with around a C / C+ in this class. All of my other grades are A except one other A-. Does anyone know the policy for a circumstance like this. I am worried as it is only this one class that I am struggling in. Thanks.",

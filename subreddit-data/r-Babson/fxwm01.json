I have a large interest in the arts, and I also want to take some courses in international affairs of some sort. With that in mind, how many courses should I take for one semester? I'm not sure if the preamble is any help; if it's not, how many courses would you say the average Babson student takes in one semester?",

Everyone in your class is taking the same thing in a slightly different order.\n\nThe recommended course load is 16 credit hours but you can take as low as 12 (I think), and up to 20 (if you have a good GPA) during your second semester.\n\nFirst semester you\u2019ll definitely take FME and first year seminar which add up to be 4 credits. The other 3 classes are \u201cyour choice\u201d of a variety of classes similar to gen-ed but specialized for business.",

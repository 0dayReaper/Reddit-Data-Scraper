I made a comment on a post before, talking a little about the realities of transferring from here and some of the STEM opportunities at Babson. TLDR: you will have to get past some grade deflation and work much harder to land positions in tech companies if you stay here, but tech at Babson is possible. \n\nDM me if you want more personal details on my transfer experience and advice.",

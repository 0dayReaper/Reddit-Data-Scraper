    "postText": "I received an admit from Babson college for MBA. Although it's the best univ for entrepreneurship but just wanted to confirm how is Babson for finance and if it has a good finance pipeline. \nI want to do a job in US post graduating, pay back the loan &amp; return to India to start my own business. So for this, would this univ be a good choice in terms of the program repuation, ROI ? \n\nAlso, I have a 3 year work ex in India from a small CA Firm, would that be a hindrance as I saw that most students have either good work ex or have already started their entrepreneurial journey ?\n\nIs it true that post MBA US companies don't hire individuals with lesser work experience, they require 4 years experience at least ?\n\nI have received $ 30K scholarship for first year &amp; conditional $ 30K scholarship for second year. I have applied to Rochester Simon &amp; Boston Questrom but waiting for their decisions.",

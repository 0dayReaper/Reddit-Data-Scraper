I am not sure how it works with soccer, but all the coaches emails are here: [http://www.babsonathletics.com/sports/w-soccer/coaches/index](http://www.babsonathletics.com/sports/w-soccer/coaches/index)\n\nI would just email the head coach and tell them your situation and that you are interested in playing for Babson. Most of the staff is on break for the holidays though, so I am not sure they will get back to you in a timely manner.",

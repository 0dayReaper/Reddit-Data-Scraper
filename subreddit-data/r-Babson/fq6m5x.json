    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nSo I was accepted into Babson with the Presidential Scholarship (so about $27k a year) which is amazing and I am very excited. Except that it would still cost my family $47k/year and that is just not possible to afford. My FAFSA EFC is crazy high because of withdrawals from 401k to keep our family afloat during a rough time, but would it be appropriate or even possible to ask for more aid to make it around $33-34k which is the price of my state school...?\n\nThanks y'all!",

            "comment": "You should ask for sure.  You don't lose anything by asking the question. The challenge though is how has coronavirus scrambled Babson's financial aid math.  Will there be fewer students who can pay the full amount putting more pressure on aid?  I am not sure how endowments work but the value of their endowment is likely much lower due to the stock market.  Will full-pay international students come or will virus keep away?  Will they increase acceptances by a few % point, keep their yield and have too many students (Unlikley).  So many moving parts.",

            "comment": "dude, there are soooo many factors for getting into college. Here's my tips:\n\n1) Write a kickass Common App and Babson Question Essay. Make it personal. Make it endearing. Focus on conveying an attitude that is determined to reach some goal, or find a goal. \n\n2) Have a decent GPA. Just having one class be a fluke isn't going to kill a gpa tbh if you're talking cumulative. \n\n3)Have some luck. \n\nThere are other things, but most of that is stuff you shoulda done over a year ago.",

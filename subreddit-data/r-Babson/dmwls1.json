Nevertheless, Babson is one of my top choices so I'd like to show my interest in them. Current/former students:\n\nWhat do you like about Babson?\n\nWhat makes it unique (besides being #1 in entrepreneurship)?\n\nWhat are some landmarks around campus or events/traditions only the students there know?\n\nWhat are some of your favorite places/things to do on campus?\n\nWhat is eTower really like?\n\nThanks! :)",

I\u2019ve met a ton of people from across the world who are interested in entrepreneurship. It creates a great environment that motivates you and encourages you to pursue your interests. Everybody\u2019s super supportive of each other and there\u2019s always great opportunities to learn. \n\nAs for Etower, my roommate applied to join next semester and we\u2019ve both met quite a few of its members. Etower is the most competitive specialty housing group at the school. However, even as a nonmember, you can still go to their weekly talks with different entrepreneurs in the area. It\u2019s a great opportunity to connect with more like minded people. As I sad everybody, including Etower residents, are going to be more than happy to help you out when they can.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m applying to Babson and the deadline is in 8 days exactly. I havnt started with the 500 word essay yet because I\u2019m highly in doubt whether I should do the essay or the 1 min Youtube video. My prime conflict is 500 words essay gives me a lot of space where as a 1 min video will allow me about 200 words to speak but at the same time a creative video can demonstrate my passion better than an essay because I\u2019m not a highly effective writer.\n\nAny suggestions are welcome, I have done several businesses over the years and tried many ventures. I plan to express how my love for entrepreneurship was born that way and what attracts me about Babson are some specific professors, clubs and classes they have to offer.\n\nSo finally, 1 min video or 500 word essay?",

    "postText": "Hi everyone!\nI\u2019m applying to babson this year (\u201826) and I just wanted some advice from those who applied and got in. I live in the US and I plan on applying early decision as well. Currently, my gpa is around a 3.9 and I have taken a few ap classes with one honors. Also, since my Sat score sucks, I\u2019m not going to submit it. \nIf someone got in this year for class of 25, would you be willing to share your stats and how you got in and when you applied?\n\nThank you so much and I really appreciate it !",

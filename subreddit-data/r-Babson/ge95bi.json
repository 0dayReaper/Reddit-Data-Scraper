Location wise, and quality of the building &amp; bathrooms.\n\nWest &amp; Central have the big \u201ccollege experience\u201d dorm type feel. \n\nSouth is quite literally like a hotel (best bathrooms in my opinion) and your floor is more likely to be a community.\n\nIf you get Forest, North, or Mattos they\u2019re not too terrible though. Forest has at least a 5 min walk to get to classes (up a hill usually) compared to 2 mins at other dorms, social scenes good though. North and Mattos? Well you rarely hear about anything going on there... All 3 aren\u2019t too pleasing on the eyes.",

But if you want a peaceful night and a weekend without noise, it's a great choice.\n\nYou share the kitchen and bathroom with the students on the same floor\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nForest:\n\nPros:\n\nBigger rooms than Mattos\n\nHave your own kitchen and bathroom\n\nCons: Bad location\n\nToo far from anything: classes, dining hall, gym center, library and in the evening/nigh fall and winter, if you go back to the dorm, it takes you 5 mins to walk in the cold and freezing weather and everything is dark with lots of trees (quite scary for those who don't like walking alone in darkness)",

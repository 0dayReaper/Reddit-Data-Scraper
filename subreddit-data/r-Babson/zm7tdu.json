    "postText": "So happy that my son was accepted ED today ! Just curious , I saw the loan information given but I did not see any merit awarded . I\u2019m curious if that is because it\u2019s contingent on the scholarships he will be applying for ( deadline is still a little bit out ). I wasn\u2019t sure if those scholarships that you apply for are the only merit they offer . His friends who have been accepted at other schools were told their \u201cmerit award \u201c.  Thoughts ?",

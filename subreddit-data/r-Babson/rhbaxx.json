    "postText": "Hi guys, so I am an International student and I applied for the MS Finance. Some hours ago I legit received a call from an American number saying they represented Babson and they wanted to let me know I got accepted. I am so confused though why I still do not see anything on the portal. This girl told me that everything will be visible within the next few hours/days but on this reddit I see people already knowing the amount of financial aid they got. So I am so confused. \ud83d\ude05\n\nWhat should I do/think? \n\n\nThank you!",

As you fill out the questionnaire you answer generic questions about your living habits. However, you can request a roommate. Some people chose their roommates via social media or platforms like roomsurf.",

It should just ask basic questions like \u201cdo you go to sleep before 11\u201d \u201cdo you wake up before 8\u201d \u201cdo you care if your roommate smokes\u201d etc. That\u2019s pretty much the most say you\u2019ll get in the application. \n\nYou can pre pick a roommate which a lot of incoming freshman do surprisingly. Basically no say in where you dorm but you can try to put a note in the application (or at least you could in the past) requesting something (single, double, specific dorm, etc.) and hope for the best.",

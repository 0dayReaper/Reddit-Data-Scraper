This semester non-athletes and varsity athletes have been using the same facilities, which can be a bit annoying with scheduling. They just got a bunch of new equipment though. \n\nFood is ok. If you are into health there is always a salad bar in the main dining hall and some way of getting protein. Nothing to write home about.\n\nThere are shuttles to boston and the commuter rail is a mile walk from campus which goes into Boston. ",

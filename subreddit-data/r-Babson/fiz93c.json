    "postText": "so basically... i\u2019m international. i just really like babson and also got accepted. but then people said it\u2019s such a small college, it doesn\u2019t have a good reputation and back in my own country no one actually knows it. (cuz i\u2019ll probably have to go back for work as an international student, right?) considering the amount of money i have to spend to go to babson and other options i have (uk top schs like lse warwick)im now very very confused. things i like about babson is how focused it is on business and their curriculum (like u get to learn so much abt different aspects of business cuz i\u2019m super into it). also the small community and other opportunities which sound great to me. so i want to know what\u2019s your opinion on babson (from their students and also others perspective) and will i be better off going to uk or somewhere else cuz babson is not that affordable to me.",

The alumnus who interviewed me explained how helpful the alumni network is so it\u2019s not just the education you\u2019re getting a benefit from.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to pursue anything other than entrepreneurship then maybe Babson isn\u2019t the right college for you. \n\nI\u2019ll leave the rest of it to the actual students at Babson",

Babson has excellent job placement and ROI, but it also really only caters to business focused students. Overall unless you want to come to the USA, LSE is a better school.",

The Manors are the most recently renovated so the dorms aren't bad at all. Forest is a little removed from the other dorms and is closer to the dining hall. It isn't recently renovated but the rooms also aren't terrible and the lounge is fun to be in. Some rooms are a little bit small and your freshman year its random which housing you'll get. However I don't think I've really heard anyone complain about dorms the freshman year.",

I definitely know of some \u201cglobal scholars\u201d, but I am not familiar with the scholarship eligibility requirements. Also, I really hope that this sub becomes more active/relevant for current students and less of a sounding board for prospective students.. like applying college is a chance, no student on this sub or at Babson can give you a percentage of how likely it is that you get in. You just can\u2019t know these things because a whole admissions board reviews qualitative and quantitative information about you compared to other applicants\u2026 just apply to several colleges and try to practice mindfulness while you\u2019re awaiting the decision.",

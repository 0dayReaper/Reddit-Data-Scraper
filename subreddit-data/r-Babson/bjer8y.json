    "postText": "Hey everyone, I've been admitted to Babson's class of 2023. I'm quite close to enrolling but the only thing stopping me is the fact that there won't be a possibility to do an engineering minor/ double degree. I understand that Babson has a partnership with Olin college through which I can get a certificate in engineering studies and take one course at Olin per semester. However, I was wondering whether there are other opportunities within Babson or otherwise to do something like a 4+1 program for two degrees (Olin and Wellesley seem to have one) or some sort of dual degree or minor in engineering/CS  \n\nThanks :D",

    "postText": "For those attending Babson right now, what do the politics on campus look like? Democratic, republican, independent, etc.  How would you describe the political beliefs of people on campus as a whole? Do many professors and students advocate for equal rights regardless of your color, sexual orientation, etc.? Do politics come up in many discussions as well as group projects?\n\nI come from a progressive environment, and I'm worried that if Babson isn't the slightest bit progressive I will feel uncomfortable in this new environment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you",

Basically people aren't going to care about your race or sexual orientation, but if you are advocating tax the rich more or are a huge fan of AOC it probably will be at odds with a lot of other students",

I grew up in a very right-sided family, and I'd say I was center-left by the time I graduated. You'll meet and make friends with people on both sides of the aisle, and your political views won't alienate you from all of campus. \n\nWhere you will likely see widened political sentiments are with the faculty, and it is simple to guess. Your 'business' professors (ie: accounting, law, finance, management) tend to skew to the right and your 'arts and humanities' professors (ie: rhetoric, sciences, art, theater, music) tend to skew to the left. I had one professor openly preach their views in response to a student's remark and derail a lecture. For the thousands of other lectures I had over the 4 years, professors openly encourage and are good moderator for students to share and explore each other's opinions!",

            "comment": "Babson's a school which prides itself in diversity, this includes diversity of thought and political ideology. You are going to get a broad range of folks with differing political views and I would say you can find a pretty good mix of both republicans and democrats. The school and administration aim to be/encourage folks to be inclusive which is great. \n\nMy advice to you as you research your options would be to encourage yourself to find a school that would push yourself out of your comfort zone and maybe even challenge your beliefs a bit. I also came from a progressive/very liberal environment growing up but being able to learn about other perspectives politically while in college was something I really valued while at Babson. If you keep an open mind, you'll grow and have a much richer college experience than someone who surrounds themselves with people who think and behave just like they do.",

Generally the finance/entrepreneur bros tend to lean more right which is exactly the babson crowd. However, at the time I wasn\u2019t aware of that bias to the same extent that I\u2019m currently aware of.",

    "postText": "As a transfer student and someone who spent three semesters already at Babson, I can't emphasis more that your professors can make you feel blessed or miserable. I think it's a little bit unfair how for a same course, different professors approach the materials so differently and makes you enjoy or hate your time. I experienced this for my Business Law, Macro, and Managerial Accounting. Also, it sucks to see all other sections are full, the waitlist is full, and the add/drop is over within the first week of classes.",

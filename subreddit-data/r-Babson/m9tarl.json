There is a nice downtown area with shops and a few restaurants, but other than that there is not much to do. It is a dry town (no alcohol sold in the town). This is why Babson has its own zip code (Babson Park, MA) so they can serve alcohol on campus.",

Wellesley is going to have some decent restaurants and the Natick mall may have some shopping you\u2019re looking for, but Boston will likely be your source of entertainment. Also, don\u2019t underestimate the amount of colleges in the Boston area, there\u2019s always a college party happening.",

                            "comment": "Just wanted to add on as I grew up in Wellesley and know the area around Babson like I attended the school (I ended up going to Cali). In terms of getting to Boston, it is super easy. The commuter rail has 3 stops in Wellesley with the nearest one being at most a 20 minute walk from campus but I have done it in under 15. The road you take, Abbott, is very nice and has a good sidewalk. You can also walk down Forest Street or Wellesley Ave to get into downtown Wellesley (where there is another station) but this will take you 30-45 minutes depending on which side of campus you are and how fast of a walker you are. There is also the green line in Newton which you would have to uber to, but it has its own advantages as it goes by BC and through Brookline vs. the commuter rail which goes along the mass pike into back bay. Speaking of uber, it can be really freaking expensive. I've paid over 40 dollars to go into the city, and it can go even higher if you go towards the Seaport or Logan. Around Wellesley, it is a lot cheaper. The MBTA has huge student discounts for the train (at least they did for me when I went to WHS) and I only paid a few dollars to go into the city. People may also have cars so in any case, you can definitely get downtown pretty easily. Make sure to check the train schedules though as they run a lot less frequently on the weekends. In my opinion, Wellesley is a very pretty but as others have said, boring town. The downtown is pretty charming with some shops, but the town itself is really spread out. Lower Falls is pretty far from Babson (hour-long walk or more depending on how fast you move) but I love the food down there. In the middle of Wellesley, you have some spaced out food shops and restaurants but most of the stuff is located in downtown or Linden Square (just across the train tracks from downtown). Unfortunately the locals joke about the number of banks, real estate offices, and nail salons taking over the town, and its not an exaggeration. Babson's campus is also super pretty. I saw someone mention that Wellesley is a dry town, this is not true. They changed the law around 4 years ago so now you can get alcohol at Roche Brothers, Whole Foods, all of the restaurants, etc. If you have any other questions feel free to ask me as I know the whole area really well. Babson is a great school and the locals do enjoy its presence.",

She is involved in a lot of business extra curriculars and had a great campus visit. \n\nWhat should she know in making the decision to attend Babson, considering the price tag? Why did you choose this school?  What other schools did you consider? ",

            "comment": "First Thanks for being a mentor. High school students could really use people like that in their lives. \n\nI am a Babson alum (2015). I will try to answer your Questions.\n\nWhat to know:\n-Business only school (Don't go here if you want anything else)\n\n-Known for entrepreneurship but is capable to strong in all fields of business\n\n- Over 60k a year for tuition and room and board\n\n-Average student makes about 60K a year after graduation\n\n- 95%+ of students will have job by graduation\n\n-Not really that close to Boston (about 30 minutes to get in)\n\n- Food is mediocre at best\n\n- Lots of resources for students on campus and professors normally care about you and your career ambitions.\n\nSchools I also considered\n-Northeastern\n\n-Lehigh\n\n-Connecticut College\n\n-Umass Amherst \n\nHonestly you should see if she has any specific questions about the school as those would be easier to answer than create a generic list. \n",

She has U.S. and Canadian citizenship and is also considering Canadian universities because of the affordability. She ultimately plans to work in the U.S., though. ",

I don't know if any college is worth full sticker though if she is required to take it all as loans. Here is a link to potential scholarships she can apply for http://www.babson.edu/admission/tuition-aid/undergraduate/merit-awards/Pages/home.aspx. \n\nIf you or her have any other questions feel free to shoot me a message",

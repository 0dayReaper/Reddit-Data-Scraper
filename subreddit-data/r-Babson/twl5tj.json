It is a REALLY good thing to have in ur application process for babson bc it shows a huge amount of demonstrated interest. I talked w a few people after I got in and they told me that if a person went to the summer study, they are looked at more favorably, and tbh it was prolly one of the reasons I got into babson (I don\u2019t have the hest grades). The course also counts as a credit so if u go here you can use it to help ur gpa",

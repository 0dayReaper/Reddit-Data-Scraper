Once you've both decided on rooming together, you'll wait until they open roommate selection and then request each other as roommates. Then you wait a few weeks and find out which dorm you've been assigned to with that roommate.",

It doesn't really matter what food they like, or what clubs they want to join (helpful info for friends - doesn't matter much for roommates). Ask how they feel about bedtimes, or playing music out loud, or cleanliness, or sharing items, or having a guest sleep over - things that'll matter. But also, keep in mind that people's personalities and habits can change a L O T during the first year of college. If you're used to always going to bed at 10pm, you could easily become someone who always sleeps at 1. Or any variety of other changes. So be open to that as well",

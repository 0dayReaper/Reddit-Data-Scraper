    "postText": "It's decision day today and I'm feeling the pressure to make a choice. I've weighed the pros and cons of each school and financial aid offered is a big factor in my decision-making process. Babson has offered me the most financial aid with $65,000, while SMU Cox has offered $54,000, leaving me with a remaining $34,000 that I'll have to cover partly with loans. OU has offered the aid only paying $17,000, but it's still a significant amount.\n\nSince this is such a difficult decision for me, I'm considering reaching out to people for advice. I'm hoping to hear from current students, alumni, and anyone who has experience with these schools. Hearing about their personal experiences could help me get a better sense of what each school is really like and which one would be the best fit for me.\n\nAs someone who wants to major in business and is also looking for a great atmosphere, I've narrowed down my choices to these three schools. Here's what I see as the pros and cons of each option:\n\n**PROS AND CONS DONT INDICATE MY BIAS BY THERE ONLY BEING 1**\n1. Babson College:\nPros:\n- Babson is known for being one of the top business schools in the country.\n- The school has a strong focus on entrepreneurship, which is something I'm interested in.\n- The campus is located near Boston, which could provide me with a lot of opportunities for internships and networking.\n- I've been offered a significant amount of financial aid from Babson, making it more affordable.\n\nCons:\n- Babson is a smaller school with limited options for majors and extracurricular activities.\n- The weather in Massachusetts can be tough to handle during the winter months.\n- The cost of living in the Boston area is higher than in some other parts of the country.\n\n2. SMU Cox School of Business:\nPros:\n- SMU Cox is also highly regarded in the field of business education.\n- The school is located in Dallas, which is close to my current home and could provide me with networking opportunities in the area.\n- SMU Cox offers a wide range of majors and minors, allowing me to explore other areas of interest.\n- I've been offered a significant amount of financial aid from SMU Cox, making it more affordable.\n\nCons:\n- I will need to take out loans to cover some of the cost of attending SMU Cox.\n\n3. University of Oklahoma:\nPros:\n- The University of Oklahoma is a large public university with a wide range of majors and extracurricular activities.\n- The cost of attending OU is significantly lower than the other two schools on my list, and I won't need to take out loans to cover the cost.\n- Norman, the town where OU is located, has a friendly and welcoming atmosphere.\n\nCons:\n- OU may not have the same level of prestige as Babson or SMU Cox, which could impact my job prospects after graduation.\n- Norman is a smaller town, which could limit my access to internships and networking opportunities..\n\nUltimately, I know that the decision is up to me and I need to choose the school that feels right for me. But any input or advice would be greatly appreciated!",

Not only that i feel like going to college for business is basically buying a certain level of prestige. so i would say prestige is a important factor! Best of luck!",

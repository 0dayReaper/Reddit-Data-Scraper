                    "comment": "Well at least for me, It took like a month or two after getting accepted to actually get the financial aid info, so I'm assuming that it takes time for them to process your info, I found out about my financial aid through the package they sent me through the mail along with my physical acceptance letter but the financial aid should be online through the Babson Portal.\n\nAnd honestly Babson is a Full need financial aid school which means that they'll usually pay most of your tuition minus your EFC= expected family contribution through grants, scholarship and work study though in the worst case they say you'll have to take out maybe 3-4k a year in loans.\n\nAs for my advice I'd say, don't be scared to tell them about any special circumstances you have or any problems you and your family have that impacts your families financial abilities like for me my parents passed away last year so I live with my grandparents and I told them that in my application, a lot of people are scared to talk about that personal stuff but colleges won't judge you and it could help when they consider your financial aid package.\n\nAnd there are some Babson scholarships you can apply to as well though it's important to mention that there are some that you don't have to apply to in order to have a chance at getting them, I received the Babson Diversity leadership award scholarship because of multiple factors that I spoke about in my essay so I definitely would say that it's best to speak about any hardships both financial and emotional that you and your family went through.",

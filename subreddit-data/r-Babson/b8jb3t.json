    "postText": "I know a lot of business-focused colleges tend to be disproportionately male, which can create a sort of \u201cbusiness bros\u201d atmosphere. Is this the case at babson? I noticed that babson has much better gender diversity than other such colleges, so I was curious if that\u2019s broken up as a result. \n\nAlso, totally separate question, but I\u2019ve noticed a disproportionate amount of Babson\u2019s advertising is focused on FME. Is this consistent with how babson allocates resources, and if so, do upperclassmen find their classes to be held as less important to the school?",

            "comment": "One distinction - Babson is a business college, not just business focused, so every student is equally deserving to be in any conversation about business, finance, entrepreneurship, etc. This eliminates a lot of the cliquiness you\u2019ve seen elsewhere. Also, at least 25% of the student body is international, so every class and group is bound to be mixed. \n\nAs for FME - it\u2019s heavily touted because 1) it\u2019s a unique program and 2) every student goes through it as a freshman. It can influence which classes you choose in your later years, so it\u2019s one of the most important aspects of the education. Once you start taking the higher level courses you\u2019ll see that the different divisions (finance, entrepreneurship, analytics, etc.) have impressive faculty and robust curriculums. ",

It may be different now, you could ask a current student/staff member to see how often it runs. \n\nThe most dependable way (besides driving, which isn\u2019t always the quickest) to get downtown during the week is taking the commuter rail from Wellesley Hills. It\u2019s about a 1 mile walk from campus (so a quick Uber) and the most reliable public transportation in terms of schedule, because the green line T from the Woodland stop can be very inconsistent.

The shuttles have come gone and come back. \n\nYou can always fall back in walking 1 mile to the commuter rail to take that in. And it\u2019s mostly down hill in a nice neighborhood. ",

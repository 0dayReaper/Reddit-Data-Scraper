I'm still 15 though so I wanted to ask if Babson has any possibility to defer admission since I couldn't find anything online.\n\n Also, I submitted my financial aid documents late and my household income is below $10k, will I be able to appeal financial aid while I'm potentially on gap or will I still get the appropriate amount this year?",

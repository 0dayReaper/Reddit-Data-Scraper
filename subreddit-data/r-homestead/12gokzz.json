There's a fair amount of variance depending on the documents.\n\nThe problem with HOAs isn't usually the election results as much as bylaws and the residents themselves. There's no leeway when it comes to the enforcement part. A report is made to the property management company and/or the proper committee chair within the HOA. Oftentimes the management company documents the case and evidence and sends it to HOA members who then review the bylaws and evidence and put forth the punishment. I'm sure there's probably some HOAs out there that have leniency built in for enforcement, but most cases it's just reported and enforced in the typical manners. HOAs as a whole are ill equipped to evolve with the times as amending the bylaws is usually a significant affair or impossible without dissolving the HOA, which itself can sometimes be nearly impossible without legal intervention.",

Are they often times too controlling and power tripping for things that aren't really an issue? For sure. Considering most people don't live on acreage and have to live literally next door to each other, 1 person can easy ruin a neighborhood. I've personally witnessed mechanic shops run out of homes, dilapidated RVs, ruined fences, toys and random items strewn across lawns, all kinds of animals running loose, side paneling falling off, rotting tree houses, smelly trash piled up, bon fires, infested above ground pools, etc. The list goes on.",

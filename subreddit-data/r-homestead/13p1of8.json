    "postText": "My husband and I closed on 5 acres of old corn/soy bean field today. We are super excited to get in and start reviving the soil. Someday we\u2019d like to build a home and farm it, but for now we\u2019re planning to go slow and just keep repairing the dirt.\nWe\u2019ve got enough summer cover crop to cover the acerage, but we\u2019re feeing a little intimidated about how to go about it.\n\nWe don\u2019t own any equipment yet. Ideally we\u2019d like a small tractor with a mow deck and front loader, but, you know, money. I guess my question really is: how should we prep the soil for cover crop? Also, there\u2019s no rain in our forecast for the next couple weeks\u2014is it better to wait for rain and let the weeds keep growing, or maybe figure out a way to irrigate it?\n\nAny advice welcome and appreciated!\n\nEdit: We do have about 200 lbs of summer cover crop mix (crimson clover, radish, sunflower, peas and buckwheat) sitting in our garage ready to go\u2014just wondering if we need to do anything to the ground first or worry about water!",

Take a couple or 3 days and hand scatter works fine. Of course it takes more seed to take than drilling.\n\nMaybe there's some no till deer plot seed packages... look in the package and see what grows best in your area and buy some seed at a seed store to save money over what the deer plot specific seed package sells for. Or maybe the seed store will mix or has a recommendation for a cover crop.\n\nI don't know where you are, but look up sun hemp, maybe this fall oats, cereal rye. I seed Clovers, annual (Korean) lespedeza, chicory, oats and cereal rye. (Not ryegrass) My sheep love it.",

I've heard of some that loan out equipment, especially for conservation practices like planting cover crops. They might also have programs that will pay for future cover crop costs and conversation-related infrastructure.",

            "comment": "The other suggestions on here are great, but I'd go native and cheap...if you think you have the time. Scope out local natives growing in your area, wait for them to go to seed, and then start saving seeds until next spring, mix them and then broadcast them.\n\nIf you go this route, it'd be a good idea to label your seeds before mixing (can use a plant ID app for this if unsure, I use plant net and inaturalist), especially since some of these will probably need to be cold stratified before they can sprout. \n\nNatives will send a lot more organic matter into your soil and be more beneficial to native pollinators. [This guy](https://youtube.com/@NativeHabitatProject) does a ton of this in north AL, but you'll want to get seeds that a localized to you.\n\nIf you really want to really want to get a cover crop started ASAP, I'd go with sorghum Sudan grass. It sends a TON of organic matter above and below the soil surface and it'll completely die off in winter, if you experience any sort of freezing temps",

            "comment": "Broadcasting seed on 5 acres can get wasteful pretty quick simply due to uneven application rate. 200 pounds of seed is 40 pounds to the acre. You can evenly stretch that seeding rate out with a seed drill, but not with broadcasting.\n\nYour best option is to hire a seeding contractor and have them plant with a grain drill (if traditional cover crops) or plant with a Truax seed drill (if you want to plant native prairie).",

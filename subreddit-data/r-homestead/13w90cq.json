    "postText": "Before I backfill the holes, I\u2019m wondering if I should also add the ph adjusted soil from the middle path between rows?\n\nI removed bank run gravel to get the holes 12-18\u201d deep.\n\nThe top surface is 6\u201d of rich top soil adjusted to 4.5 PH, 1.5 yards of peat moss rototilled into 2- 4\u2019X50\u2019 rows, 5 foot spacing. \n\nFor irrigation, I\u2019ve purchased enough to install one continuous loop of 1/2\u201d drip irrigation, looped around each plant. Close-loo design. Timer on water faucet irrigation system.",

            "comment": "I recommend adding the soil because of their shallow root system - really mound up the dirt. I would maybe add a little sand mixed with peat moss (I add sand in clay heavy soil). Once they\u2019re planted cover the mound with pine needles. \n\nWhat kind of blueberries are they?",

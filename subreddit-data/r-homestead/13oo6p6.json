They really don't grow too much until the ground gets warm enough. And, if you plant them early the frost kills off the top and they just have to regrow.\n\nI've tried to plant my garden early, I've started my plants in the cold frame, I've put the water filled plastic teepees around them. I've seen very little difference in growth between starting the seeds when the ground is warm enough and starting them early in the cold frame and transplanting. The plants just don't take off until the ground warms up--by the middle of July all the plants, whether started from seed in the garden or transplanted from the greenhouse are pretty much exactly the same size.",

I used to start things as early as possible and start planting before the average last frost (after checking weather forecast, etc), but then I did some experimenting last year. I started some seeds a about 3 weeks after my first set and didn't put them in the ground until two weeks after average last frost, when daytime temps were in the 70s and nights in the 50s. The tomatoes I planted later grew faster and produced more than the ones I had out early when it was still cold out.\n\nI think the cold temperatures stunts the growth and it takes them a while to recover, but plants put in the ground when it's warm just go nuts right away.",

I'm no expert myself, but I help my retire mother with all the digging and bed building etc, and basically the way she grows her potatoes is to plant them all, and once the plant reaches a certain size she basically spreads straw around the whole bed, keeping as much of the green growth above the straw as possible.\n \n As far as I understand it, the reason for \"hilling\" them is mostly to keep the sun off of them, so using the straw does basically the same thing. \n \n \nI think she also used a method of putting a layer of cardboard (with no plastic print on it) under the first layer of soil, directly onto the original grass, to stop weeds and grass coming up through it. It worked a charm and we got a similar yield you did from an 8ftX8ft bed (7 rows of 7 plants, so 49 plants total).\n \nI can share pictures if you want, but it might take a while to get them.\n \n \nEdit: I just read the comment basically suggesting the same thing. Being from Ireland I never even considered fire being a risk! It's crazy the different things you have to think of depending on where you live.",

I lost my watermelon vines, asparagus... everything.\n\nI had four tomato vines, some cucumber, sage, and thyme planted against the chicken pen... those were doing great! neighbor's pot belly pig rooted them all up, cages and all, yesterday.\n\nAt least I got my three tomatoes off there first.\n\nETA:\n\nSoon as the weather breaks, I'm adding 32 more feet on to my 16 x 8 x 6 hoop coop.  I'm going to put a gate at each 16ft section, kinda like the doors/chambers in a submarine.\n\nI'm going to let all my chickens (26) have the full run over autumn and winter, then herd them back into the 'chambers' and shut them out of one or two of them.  Then use the sections to plant a garden.  Run some soaker hoses in... and once the garden is done, I'll open the gates and let them back in for clean up.\n\nThat'll keep the deer, crows, blue jays, rabbits, the pig, and dogs, out of my garden and also help fertilize/enrich the soil (Which is piss poor).",

We have powdery fine sand.  Like, 2 feet of it, on our place.  I noticed in the pen/run, the soil is significantly nicer after just a few months - but.  I put old hay in there for them to scratch around in, and they've tilled it into the soil, and between that and the poop, the soil is turning to black gold AND they've eliminated all weeds.\n\nI could also use it as a way to sort the mommas and babies from the adults to cut down on squabbles.  Hell, I could tie on somehow and use part of it for some heritage breed turkeys in time.\n\nI THINK I could even plant some of the shorter/dwarf varieties of corn up the middle, with rows on either side for pollination, since it's 6ft at the peak. \n\nIDK.

I know this because hubs and I went on our first real vacation in a few years... and someone who shall go unnamed (daughter) opened up the LQ to my horse trailer and left it open... and it rained for four days, straight flooding downpours... Then it shut off like a tap and the heat hit.\n\nETA: WE HAVE LOCUSTS... or... something like it I guess.  There's so many grasshoppers from such a mild winter, and so little grass, they're wiping out hay meadows and once they're out of grass, they're literally swarming houses and eating nylon window screens, they're mobbing fences and chewing on electric fence wires.\n\nThat's why I let my chickens free range all weekend - to clean house on the hundreds of grasshoppers we have at our place now.  They've not swarmed our place yet, but they're out there.  I enlisted my brave hens, their off spring, and the one rooster I have... and four ducks... to do battle.",

I noticed yesterday for every 1 hummingbird at my feeders, there were 5 bumble bees.\n\nI'm going to go home today, dig out a chick waterer, and try to rig it up to hang from the double shepherd's crook I have, and fill it with sugar water for the bees.  I've never seen them at my feeders in this great a number, ever... but this year, we're at a new property and I don't have flowers of any kind set out yet because the house isn't finished.",

It was like they knew to leave that shit alone right until it was almost harvesting time lol. I did keep some peppers though and I made about 1 jar of salsa...",

The tynes on the cut end can be jabbed into the ground, like a regular cage, but it will be a much more stout structure than can be moved and reused for ages. You can usually get about 3 large cages out of 1 large panel, which will often be a bit cheaper than buying wimpy  \"tomato cages\". Any small scraps can be used as a trelis, or you can make your cage into more of a triangle shape, rather than a circle.\n\nIt's essentially the same idea as using Weld-Wire, just beefed up a bit.

This year I decided to try starting everything from seedlings, and it's been a big disappointment.  They germinated and grew to a couple inches, but then stopped.  I planted them, and they all promptly died.  Then I tried again, and left them in the seedling planters for longer, until they started growing their second set of leaves.  That took way longer than it should have, and I already had a late start, and most still died after replanting.  Out of a dozen or so plants (tomatoes, peppers, cilantro, parsley, etc.) the only thing I have left is 1 pumpkin and 1 cucumber plant.\n\nI'm sure there's something really basic that I'm doing wrong, but it's been kind of disheartening.",

Pop the mostly dry soil out of the container, remove the plant from the soil and replant it until the leaves are just slightly above the soil. The section of stem that you bury will form roots and create a deeper root system. And if you can place them outside when possible (or use an oscillating fan) the breeze will strengthen the stems.",

The banana and bell peppers are going gangbusters, and usually bells are my slowest growers. Squash is running behind, as I had to replant twice before I found out where a devilish squirrel was getting in, lol.\n\nSome herbs are also crazier than normal - basil and chives namely. Dill already pulled, dried and put in a container. I got behind on the lemon balm and let it wilt away after cutting. Oregano is in the dehydrator right now and thyme will go after that. One pot of thyme bolted early but the regrowth came back great. I tend to way overplant herbs and then whine that I can't keep up. (Basil, dill, lemon balm, rosemary, sage, oregano, thyme, chives and chamomile this year, multiple large pots of most.)\n\nOfficially to the point where I am picking straight from the garden to top off 2 meals a day. i love this time of year!",

My husband grows a ton of peppers and all of them look really healthy. I pulled back on tomatoes and only did 5 plants and they have been my main issue. We have fungus and it\u2019s gotten a of them but one. Luckily our efforts seem to be working and we\u2019ve had 4 additional volunteer plants pop up so I\u2019m letting them go since they have a good shot. Eggplant did horrible for some reason. Yellow and green squash are producing so I\u2019m really excited about that. Cucumbers are, but very slowly. Getting ready to make sauerkraut from the first 2 heads, still habe 4 to deal with. Getting ready to pull first round of beets so lots of kvass in our near future! Broccoli and cauliflower failed for us like always, but red Russian kale is looking stout. So far butternut and spaghetti squash are making it, and we should have a good sweet potato haul this year. Temps just dropped a bit and we are getting a lot of rain so we\u2019ll see how that goes. Overall I\u2019m happy, but the tomatoes are killing my soul a little. I\u2019m going to need to really treat and prep the solid a ton end of this year, beginning of next.",

Got about 50 zucchini from 2 plants before we ran out of freezer space, even more tomatoes. What's still growing in the beds: watermelon, ice cream melon, bush beans (not looking good), sunflowers. I planted citron melon and cucamelon directly in the ground in June and they're doing fine, also tepary beans which literally cannot be killed except by squirrels or fire. Fruit trees: my weird lemon tree that produces useless grapefruit-sized lemons which are mostly peel is doing great, the dwarf bananas I planted seem to have been overwatered which is absurd in this weather, the prickly pears have put on some good growth but not much fruit.",

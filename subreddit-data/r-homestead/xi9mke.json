Formed via volcanic eruption but was being reclaimed slowly by the grinding down of the tides.

Avocados are a good example. They may have evolved to be consumed by giant ground sloths. Nothing else seems to be able to reliably consume and defecate their giant seeds. Luckily for the avocado, humans began cultivating them before the ground sloths ([allegedly](https://allthatsinteresting.com/mapinguari)) went extinct, so they have survived to this day.",

When they ran out of sleeves, they started ripping off strips from the bottom of their shirts. Pretty gross if you ask me. As for what did *I* use? I always kept a roll of toilet paper and a book in the pouch for our field protective mask (gas mask.) Because the little pieces of TP they gave us in our MREs were so small, so few and were made of sandpaper. So, I had a roll of Charmin! (Everyone wanted my TP.) And the book was because you never knew when you may suddenly get a ten-minute break, so I had a book to enjoy during that 10-minute break.",

These ready to grow seeds are deposited with a pile of compost ready to grow. \n\nHorse people often feed pumpkins to the horses.  Then they collect those piles and dump them right where they want next year's pumpkins.    \n\nBTW, horse manure is safer for growing food, followed by small birds.   Dogs?  Not so much.

    "postText": "Hi homesteaders! I am, unfortunately, not one of you yet. I'd love to be, but I'm not sure how much I'd actually enjoy it vs. the idea of it. But damn do I want some chickens and to feed my family from my own garden.\n\nSo what does an average day in your life look like for you? What projects are you working on right now? What does a day look like in the fall vs. the spring/summer vs. the winter? How early are you getting up, how much of your day is spent actually doing physical labor and tedious tasks? How much is spent outside vs. inside?\n\nI know that's a lot of questions - don't feel like you have to answer all of them! Just tell me what you want to share. I'm excited to read all your answers.\n\nThank you guys so much!",

But I can tell you about this morning.\n\nawoke about 3 a.m., sat with hubby and had coffee.  Then I pitted the cherries I had picked from our North Star cherry tree this week, and made a pie.  At dawn (5:30 a.m.) we went out to feed the horses.  I stayed out to keep working on a livestock shade I\u2019m building, and also worked on the horse walker.  At 9 a.m. the neighbor girl came over to help with breaking yearlings.  These yearlings will be entered in a sale this fall, and that\u2019s one way we make money.  After an hour she left and I went inside to get ready for a zoom hearing.  Did that, then went back out to check on the orchard and see where the cows were in the pasture.  Later this week we are re-planting 2 fields with sudex, and discussed whether to set Up the laser level or if they were level enough.  Decided to level one small field and leave the other as is.  We will drive to buy the seed tomorrow.  This afternoon I\u2019m doing a little more work in my office.\n\neverybody\u2019s place is unique.  We raise cattle, horses, hay and I have my orchard.  We trade our fruit for vegetables with the neighbors.  We raise our cattle for our beef.  My husband frequently trades beef for haircuts because that guy likes a steak.  Next week will be a variation of all the above.  Basically I\u2019m outside from dawn until I wear out or have to do some office work, and I love it.",

            "comment": "Wake up at 4am because the sunrises are so beautiful I can't sleep well, knowing I'm missing one.  Take all 3 dogs for a walk down the 1/4 mile driveway while smoking a joint just to stretch the legs and wake up my body.  I'll also spend this time looking for a spot to set up a camera to record the sunrise because that's just a hobby of mine.  Then I'll work on what I call \"dark chores\".  Anything I can do without sunlight.  That might be gathering cow dung or mixing potting soil or building a fire or organizing our van.  Once there's enough sun to actually see what I'm doing, I'll usually make some kind of breakfast and then get started on the things I need the light to do like planting in the garden or organizing the shed.  Once hubby wakes up, we climb down into one of our 8ft deep foundation holes to finish the digging.  We have 9/12 completed.  Dig holes in the desert until I start getting hot.  Then its time to  build a fire under the cattle trough bath tub.  Get that started and get back to work on the holes.  Once the water is warm (we just heat it to \"not cold\" in summer.  Usually 3-6 logs) we'll hop in and cool off and/or wash up.  Then we'll either go into town to enjoy the AC in the van and shops.  Or we'll set up a patio umbrella and sit in the shade, waiting for the sun to pass a little bit and the heat to get a little less brutal.  By the time the sun is low enough to get back to work, it's just about time to make dinner so I'll usually get that started and we'll do a little more work while things are cooking.  Set up a camera to record sunset or astrophotography.  Then it's off to bed to do it all over again.",

            "comment": "We are suburban homesteaders, probably don\u2019t qualify as true homesteaders yet, just working on getting more self sufficient. We have 10 acres with 18 chickens and a trio of meat rabbits (with two litters about to hit weaning age). I work from home full time 4 days a week and my husband works part time 5 days a week.\n\nMy husband goes to work in the morning, then spends his afternoons mowing/trimming, doing trail maintenance, killing invasive species, or building what needs built. Previous projects were the chicken coop and run and the rabbit hutches. Current project is a permanent hunting platform in the back field.\n\n\nIn the morning, I feed and water all the animals, takes about 15 minutes including the pets. Then I go to work for 10 hours in my home office. Sometimes I work outside if it\u2019s nice, and often I take breaks to walk my property, stare at cute bunnies, or investigate squawking chickens. After work I feed the rabbits, collect eggs, and go harvest anything that\u2019s ready for harvest (right now it\u2019s picking strawberries) it might take as much as an hour if there\u2019s a lot of stuff to pick. After dinner, when it gets dark I will go out and close the chicken coop and double check that the rabbits are all set, 5 minutes. If it\u2019s been dry I\u2019ll water the garden areas near the house.\n\n\nOn the weekends, I do any projects I need to do- picking up and spreading brewers grains to dry for chicken feed, making chicken feed, cleaning or adding bedding to the coop, planting, weeding, watering the back field if it needs it, processing animals, canning, etc. Right now it\u2019s mostly planting and weeding and I\u2019d say I probably spend about 10 hours over the course of the weekend doing that kind of stuff. The weeds are bad because our entire property is full of invasive species. In the fall it will be more processing and canning, and tanning furs. I\u2019m also an avid hunter, so in the fall I tend to make a slow circuit around my property with my weapon every time I go out to do chores, and spend weekends sitting in the back field.\n\n\nThis level of \u201chomesteading lite\u201d I find very enjoyable. I actually find myself standing out with the chickens and rabbits in the morning wishing there were more chores I needed to do instead of going inside to sit at my desk and work. I\u2019ve recently taken up leather working as a hobby and I\u2019m hoping maybe I can get good enough at that to at least go down to a part time job, but even the way things are, for me I feel it\u2019s a huge step up from our previous more urban lifestyle. I love having land and animals and being able to produce even a small amount of my own food. I don\u2019t think I could go back. I\u2019ll be the crazy old lady living alone with 500 animals who dies and nobody finds her until weeks later when her hungry animals escape, and by then they\u2019ve already eaten me and moved on. \ud83d\ude02",

            "comment": "We have two full-time off-farm jobs to pay the bills. This means that daily maintenance has to be kept to a minimum and all major farm projects have to happen on weekends or on short afternoon work parties.\n\nIn Appalachia our arrangement isn't too uncommon, with lots of traditionally-employed people running cattle and other agricultural side businesses.\n\nWe have a large garden and an experimental perennial planting (several hundred fruit and nut trees). Unfortunately the maturing of our fruit and nut orchard has coincided with the peak of brown marmorated stinkbug infestation, which has ruined any potential harvests over the last 3-4 years. It's so bad now that we don't even bother trying to harvest most things. We're hoping natural biocontrols will migrate down here and put us in a position to actually sell some produce in the next few years.\n\nWe have about 100 trees to plant this year, broken between spring and fall planting. Our kids are active participants in the \"maintenance\" tasks -- homework and taking care of the farm animals and a few other basics is a prerequisite to any after-school \"screen time\".\n\nI think we could probably do a lot more with better time management, and we probably *would* if our harvests were good enough to make some extra income as a carrot. Someday, hopefully.",

            "comment": "We too are homestead-lite. My wife works from home 4 days and I work 3 days in a school. We have chickens for eggs and a couple of pigs that are going for slaughter next week some time. We have vegetable patches and my wife likes to grow flowers that she picks or presses.  I have a constant list of jobs to get done and constantly feel like I'm learning something new, which is both fulfilling and sometimes a bit overwhelming. I'm currently sat in our field taking a break from hand watering the 450 trees we planted in March because we haven't had rain in so long (Southern England) Sometimes weeks I do 2-3 hours of jobs a day and sometimes like now I just go as far as my energy levels will take me. If it makes you happy this lifestyle can be really satisfying, for me it's opened up an understanding of the world I had no conception of as a townie :)",

In the summer I spend a lot of time in the evening in the veg garden or doing maintaince. In the winter it is mostly just the weekends as it gets dark early. This puts a bit of pressure on them and jobs can start to stack up. Overall it is worth it for me. It is however a lot of work and will limit the things you can do.",

Boric Acid powder like that for ants and roaches also work and is relatively safe for land vertebrates. This should take care of any crawlers climbers or emerging adults.",

I would try setting up a trap like wet newspapers in a plastic container with some holes in it - bury it in a little soil by the edge of the line like the pole. Then I'd put vasculine or petroleum jelly onto the very edge of each line to deter them from trying to climb.",

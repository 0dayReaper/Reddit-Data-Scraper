They had a video of someone making a hot tub out of a wood barrel by drilling 2 holes and hooking up the coil with their connectors. \n\nI like the idea of a pool I can sit in the summer and cool off then start a fire and warm it up for night.  2 hours to heat up above freezing 3 if it's below and snowing.",

The 1000 liter cubes cud be used.. where I live they are 25.00 USD. Have a friend who works at a rum factory.

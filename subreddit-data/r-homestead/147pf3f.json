    "postText": "I made some posters awhile back about edible tree leaves. I responded to a meme on TikTok about making syrups, talking about how even though it wasn\u2019t the point of the posters, they could all be turned into syrup.\nA few of the species made people upset,  Sassafras, Pine, and Mulberry.\nWhile Sassafras was banned by the FDA because of Safrole due to studies in rats, safrole is generally more concentrated in the roots than the leaves and bark. Additionally, safrole is broken down by boiling, a part of the syrup making process.\nPine sap has traditionally been used a sweetner, and for various medical uses. It does contain terpenes, that make it in advisable to eat in large quantities.\nMulberry sap does contain some latex, which is a common allergy but it is relatively low to nonexistent in the common Morus Alba species and I did say that making syrup from mulberry sap wouldn\u2019t be worth the effort vs making it from the fruit.\nAnyways, I deleted that original post instead of argue in the comments and I\u2019m posting this poster with the species from those posters that can make the best syrups. (Plus black walnut that makes a good syrup but does not have edible leaves)",

The trunk of the tree will start to thaw while the roots are still frozen. This creates internal pressure of sap that is not able to get down to the roots. \n\nSo that all said, tapping season is usually late winter (February to March) the further north you are, the bigger the window generally is. I live in the NYC area so my window is pretty short and some years it just doesn\u2019t get cold enough. It all has to be done before the trees flower. That part I forget why, probably the flavor of the sap or something.\n\nJust be careful with how many times you tap a tree because you could kill it if not done correctly.",

Also, the rat study used to ban it involved concentrated safrole being fed to rats as 1% of their total diets for weeks. Humans would never consume close to that amount unless they were deliberately running an experiment on themselves.(or trying to use safrole to get high)",

    "postText": "Hi! I have been a long time lurker, and I\u2019ve gotten to the point where my partner and I are seriously considering diving into homesteading once we are able to buy a home. We are in the NYC area, and we have lived here all our lives. We don\u2019t hate city life, but we do like the quiet and being in nature, and being self reliant is a huge draw. \n\nBut we have realized that it may be hard or even impossible to have the amount of land we would want (at least 5 acres) while also having any benefit of city living that are important to us (businesses open past 2 or 5pm, diversity of people, more food options for eating out, access to the beach). \n\nWe have gone upstate and to Vermont and we just love the mountains. But we are also hesitant to give up aspects of the life style we grew up with. \n\nSo my question is, for people who used to live in the city and now are more rural how has that transition been like? And is a balance between the countryside and the city possible? Thank you in advance!",

            "comment": "I did not realize the soup of negativity I existed in for so many years. You acclimate to it so fully that you don't even realize there are other ways for a community to exist. That sounds hyperbolic, but leaving the city and coming out here to the wild changed my life. It changed my whole outlook not just on the importance of balance and being part of nature, but more fundamentally, what does it mean to be human? What does it mean to be mortal? What value do I want to contribute, rather than take, from the world? \n\nTo be sure you can think those thoughts in the city. But imagine this - when you go to the grocery store, everyone is genuinely kind. You get smiles, excuse mes, passing conversation - you're only in the store for say 10 minutes but those 10 minutes out here vs what those 10 min look like in the city are so vastly different. That scenario plays itself out across every aspect of rural living. It's transformative in how you see yourself relative to others, in addition to how you see yourself relative to nature. \n\nThere are things you leave behind. Saturday brunch at a cafe and walks in a highly manicured park. The ease and brevity of transportation. The sense that you are \"in the middle of things,\" which has its own draw. But you also leave behind the suffocating rigidity of a city. The rush from the next thing, to the next thing, to the next thing. In the city, you retreat to your home to detox before heading out again into the masses. What if it was the other way around? \n\nImagine if your home wasn't a place to retreat but instead a true home base. What happens, almost right away, is a desire to stay on the homestead. I leave my land, on average, every 3-4 days. Sometimes I will go a week before seeing another human. I sit with the deer and the squirrels. I delight in discovering life - ah, a little lizard, and there, a possum. And some creepy bug you've never seen, bird call you never really noticed before. This is the soup of life, not stress and friction. It's a more human way to live, and I'm a better person for the experience.\n\ntldr: like a frog in a pot of water that is slowly heating up, eventually the city will boil you alive. Jump out!",

            "comment": "I moved from a reasonably big city (in-town Atlanta) to a small town in the mountains with a population of maybe 8,000 people, but a 20 minute drive from a city with about 80,000 people.\n\nMost businesses close around 5pm, restaurants close at 8 or 9. There's only one bar/restaurant in town open until 2am. But we don't really go out to restaurants or bars much, except for lunch, so that doesn't really affect us. The weirdest thing is that because it's a bit of a tourist town, almost everything is closed on Mondays. Weekends are the busy time, so Monday is basically the weekend where shop owners and workers take their time off.\n\nThe best thing is that there's a huge community around gardening here. Everyone has a garden. Everyone knows a lot about gardening. There are 5-6 garden stores within a 20 minute drive that are far better than anything within an hour of where I lived in Atlanta. My biggest regret is spending so much time living in the city because we're so much happier here. I have more friends with similar interests than I ever had in the city. I like the slower pace of life. I like being able to do nothing because nothing is open.\n\nBut I'm not sure if my experience would be the same as yours - I grew up in a rural area and moved to a big city as an adult and I never really did like it that much. I enjoyed the walkability - I rarely ever drove my car because there were 3 grocery stores within walking distance - but I hated the noise and the crime. The last straw was when I started finding human shit on the sidewalk on my block. And now I live in an area where the only reason I lock my car is to keep bears out of it.\n\nWhen I lived in Atlanta I couldn't do any work in my front yard without having random homeless people asking me for money, asking me for food, asking me for water. And I actually did give anyone who asked food or water, for a while. Then one day I gave a dude an apple and a bottle of water and he chucked the apple down the street and said \"I don't want this shit\". After that, just water. But now when I'm working in the front yard, the only people who bother me are folks walking by who tell me how nice it looks.",

Anywhoo,  I understand what you are saying but that you throw homeless people under the bus in using them a part of your rationale for leaving ATL kinda struck a chord.  Maybe I am misunderstanding you... because a homeless man rejected your apple you up and moved?  Former ATL resident here. I was homeless there for 4 years. No drug or alcohol, just bad luck. Worked 40+ hours a week the whole time to.  Never shit on a sidewalk and would have given you a hug for an apple.  Still would.",

We go back and forth about 2x per month. We are very different from the people who live in our country town both age wise and politically so we have not made any friends and it gets a bit lonely. We also still need an airport for work travel and specialty doctors and services that we can only get in the city. It has been an adjustment now that COVID is over but I still prefer to live out here vs the city full time.",

We have 3/4 of an acre (again, a compromise), but we can still be in Manhattan in an hour to go to the opera or see our friends, two things that I care a lot about. We have a huge vegetable garden, and will have chickens and bees. We have made friends with people who have livestock, and can learn from them and trade! I love the fact that I can grow all my own vegetables, but also can drive 20 minutes and eat some of the best Chinese and Indian food in the United States, am only 8 minutes from multiple grocery stores, and multiple 24 hour diners. Obviously your personal balance and priorities may be different, but this is working out great for us, and I hope we can live here forever!",

Towns like Hillsborough are quite rural. Hunterdon County is more rural than Somerset and is where our friends who actually have livestock live. They are probably an hour and a half from NYC. For me, the issue wasn't so much being somewhere rural as leaving our actual community of friends/family who are all in the tri state area.",

That way when I want to see shows, eat unusual foods, or just experience the crazy train that is modern urban life I can be there in short time.  Id rather live in peace and go to chaos when desired than the other way around.  Sadly I dont have that option right now, but soon.   Also, what if god forbid the grid goes down? Another even worse pandemic?  Massive civil unrest?  You want to be in a city then? Or away from the starving masses with your own secure source of food and water?  Not a prepper, but things are getting dicey.  That and wild animals make great neighbors.",

But most places you'll be able to get to a Kroger or Walmart with in a 30 minute drive which isn't that bad. \n\n\"More food options\" ya not going to happen in town.  We've got several dinners in town(10 min and they do close by 6) But again you can drive farther out.  we can get to Mexican and Italian and fast food with in 20 minutes, Phu and Poke with in 40.\n\n\"Access to beach\" \nI'm pretty sure you can find rural areas with in an hours drive of there beach.  But maybe not I'm not as experienced in this one. \n\n\n\"diversity of people\" \ud83d\ude06\n\nLook the country is not going to be as \"diverse\" as the city because there are simply less people.   But each person out here is still a beautiful individual with their own unique thoughts and ideas.  All country folk are not the same.",

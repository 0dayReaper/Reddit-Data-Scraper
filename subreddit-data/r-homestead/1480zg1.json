    "postText": "Hello! We are trying to grow some basil in grow bags this year (i have HORRIBLE luck with herbs in the ground) and they are starting to yellow! We have a wide variety of plants growing in many  different grow bags this year, and everything is doing great except for these. It\u2019s nearly impossible to overwater them in these, so I don\u2019t think that is the problem, and they have been fertilized. What do you guys think is going on?? I cut off the tops a few weeks ago to encourage the plants to get bushy, but i\u2019ve seen limited growth since then :/ are they getting scorched? They are in a very sunny spot.",

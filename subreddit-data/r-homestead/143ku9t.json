    "postText": "I planted a fair bit of potatoes this year and my crop is looking like it's going to be enormous. We are a family of 3 so I'll need to preserve it. Last year I blanched some and made hash browns for the freezer. Anyone have any favourite way to keep potatoes longer like this?",

These are perfect potato storage conditions, so we store ours in old coolers with the lids propped open a bit to maintain good humidity and circulation, while keeping them in the dark.  The coolers do need to be moved inside if the temperature drops below freezing for long.  We stored ours this way in September and just finished the last of them last week.",

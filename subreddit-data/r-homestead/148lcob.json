    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI have a 2 acre forest set 120+ years ago wit a few larch, scots pine, maple, ash, whitethorn and blackthorn and id love to remove everything bar those trees. It used to have a small field in the middle and id love to bring that back. I mainly have to remove brambles, ferns and small shitty trees of no use. Whats my best approach? Ive asked a few digger drivers for quotes and none have gotten back to me so im guessing its a shitty job?. How many hours or days would it take to clear all 2 acres excl big trees with a mini digger??",

They will clear that up lovely in a few months and then you can butcher them all for the freezer. The goats eat the shrubs and small trees and the pigs tractor and till. They will rip through a blackberry bramble like it was ice cream.\n\nTakes awhile, but much cheaper (you get all that meat) and you get a better end product. Once the animals clear it up you can actually get in there and see what you have in order to selectively clear the bigger stuff.",

I have creeks that I\u2019m responsible for that have 6\u2019 banks and last year they flooded 4\u2019 beyond that.\n\nLooking around for evidence of flooding isn\u2019t how you analyze flood plains and trying to do it that way is a recipe for disaster.  A 1 in 20 year flood event will have absolutely 0 evidence where that level is by a cursory glance at the surface (this requires soil core and analyses).  Also swinging by during a heavy rain event means next to nothing.  A significant flooding event can have 10x the water levels of a routine \u201cheavy\u201d rain event and that\u2019s what you need to plan on if you\u2019re building a house.\n\nI really really hope you did proper due diligence before buying this property and hired someone to properly assess the flood conditions.  If not, please at least do that before building.",

Lucky for me my sister is a real estate agent and found this for me \"off market\" (whatever that means, there were no signs on it for sale, that I do know).\n\nThis property is fenced in the back with a pole barn and half a pond (the other half is on the neighbor).  Front of the property has 2 septic tanks, 2 wells, 3 power service poles, a pole barn garage (used to be a milk barn) a nearly 2000 sq foot house (it's in rough shape but will make a fine workshop).  I'll get a nice album of the rest posted soon.  Oh and 1G cable internet is also available.  Heaven on earth for me :)\n\nOh and the neighbor to the south and east is an orchard, and they dropped by today to let me know we can pick all their blackberries we want.  Can you say wine?  I can!  At least until I drink too much of it then I might not can say it.",

If you have to buy an old box trailer and strip that.  If you have equipment, maybe leave the shell on for storage or use as a covered bridge to make it last. If you go the covered bridge route, cover with cement/fiber siding to make it look good and hide the metal.\n\nUse an auger drill and sonotubes for foundation. Put in concrete landings on each side across the concrete pads.\n\nIf necessary, scrounge around for scrap steel I beams, then cover with the thickest 2xs you can get. The ones for shoring sides when digging are best. You can get them used, cheap or free from construction companies.\n\n  Trust me, it needs to be higher and further away from the waters edge than you think.",

Your local conservation/Soil &amp; Water District can be a great resource in your local community to help bolster habitat and riparian buffer areas on your property. Enjoy the peace and serenity that property brings you, it looks like a beautiful parcel!\n\nEDIT:\n\nAdding on here to this, looks there\u2019s a couple really beautiful and endangered darter species endemic to northern Alabama Streams - the Vermillion and Rush Darter. The Alabama Native Fish Coalition does some awesome work in the area to conserve these species and fisheries and could be a great resource as well. Enjoy and have a blast on that parcel!",

The creek behind my house is low and barely moving right now...if I hadn't seen it (a foot deep in my yard) for myself I wouldn't believe how fast it gets deep and flowing! We got an inch of rain and it didn't budge because the land is so dry is soaked it up, but an inch during rainy season raises it 6 inches. \n\nI wouldn't build or do anything if you can help it for at least a year of weather. Watch and see where it goes. You might be able to do some hydro power too.",

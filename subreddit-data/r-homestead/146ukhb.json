I\u2019ve desperately wanted to go back ever since. I grew up, kept the dream, married a man that has the same dream, and thought we\u2019d get our homestead shortly. \n\nWe just had our second year anniversary and no end in sight to apartment living. I try to do all the things that can help tide me over, like learning skills I\u2019ll need, gardening in my little container garden on our patio, visiting my sister\u2019s homestead to milk her goats, etc. but I\u2019m so miserable in the city. \n\nRealistically I know we are infinitely closer now than we were two years ago, just not close enough to actually have it yet. I\u2019m just so sick for it. In my mind we\u2019ve had a thousand different iterations of a possible homestead and I just want one of them to be real.",

Canning meat is a thing too, so don't be shy to can it.  It's really nice to have meat that doesn't rely on the refrigerator or freezer, from a 'prepared for anything' standpoint.\n\nLearn to bake. Not only will this reduce your need to visit town for bread and baked goods, but will help you utilize the food stuffs (be it plant, animal or dairy based) that you have growing on your homestead.  Carrot cakes, zucchini bread, banana bread if you're in the tropics, fruit pies and tarts, cheesecakes, plain old bread and biscuits and pancakes, etc., will help you use up your eggs too.\n\nIf your dream includes dairy goats or cows, you might consider learning to make butter, yogurt, sour cream, and cheese products.  Many are MUCH easier than you'd have ever imagined.\n\nCutting to the chase, you can start living \\~part of\\~ your dream right now, in your own kitchen.\n\nPraying that your dream becomes a reality soon.",

You can\u2019t get a traditional mortgage BUT there\u2019s other ways: 1) do a private loan- these are high interest rate with a balloon payment on the end. Generally you only pay interest until you are supposed to pay the whole chunk back, usually within 5-10 years. The way around having to pay back the big chunk is by building a permitted home and then getting a traditional 30 year mortgage and paying back the chunk out of that. 2) ag loan- there\u2019s several banks that specialize in ag loans, mostly for giant operations, but they don\u2019t mind loaning small. The issue for me was the requirements on the different loans- you may have to show a business plan that shows that the majority of your income will come from the farm. We have many nice ag buildings on our property and another loan had the requirement that the land be worth more than the sum of the buildings. \n3) construction loans: you can potentially get an ag bank to give you a construction loan. You pay only interest until house is built and it automatically rolls into a traditional mortgage which pays off the original construction loan. CATCH: you have to use their list of contractors \n4) USDA farm agency loans. In certain underdeveloped rural places you can get these. Don\u2019t know much bc I didn\u2019t qualify but worth checking out. \n\nWe ended up going with the private loan. We know a couple folks who built a small rectangle of a house with water and septic and rolled it into a traditional mortgage. We plan to have the permitted house in within 2 years. There\u2019s lots of ways to skin this cat! Get creative and start researching OP!",

That is good preparation! I would advise you to learn anything and everything about buying land and your local/state regulations. Everything about getting permits, and other majorly important details. Get acquainted with your local farmer and agricultural banks and credit unions. If you need to loan money to afford your land lot purchase they will be the ones that can either help you or direct you to other, perhaps private lenders.\n\nBuying your land will, perhaps, be the most important decision in your life. Read up on it, watch YouTube videos and make notes. Lots of notes.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but notice that you didn\u2019t mention your significant other in your post. I hope he/she is sharing your dream. The decision to homestead can be compared to the decision to get children: both people need to be committed.\n\nGood luck with everything!",

The first was a 500 acre cattle farm, we ran it 100% and owners lived on the other side of the country. The 2nd was a lot smaller, no animals but mine and my boyfriend just did upkeep there. You'd be surprised at how many of these situations exist. \n\nTalk with your local extension office.. they can probably provide some great leads. Same with farmers markets and co-ops/whole foods.. I'm in a pretty rural area, but there are a few farms nearby and more springing up all the time that are run like co-ops..meaning everyone lives there, participates in growing crops and raising critters and then everyone benefits at harvest/market/freezer camp.. \n\nA few words of advice if you chose this route...no matter how much you may think you don't need it~~~ MAKE SURE YOU GET A CONTRACT! Make sure every thing..from utilities to how many hours per month is expected of you.. If it's a set number of hours,  make sure it's included if you are expected to spread them out over the entire month or if you can do them all at once and have the rest of the month for an outside job/hobby/etc. If it's not a set number, make sure your salary is listed. And include how you'll be compensated for anything above your required. \n\nI loved my years spent doing this, learned a lot and did a lot of growing up as well. But was also screwed over royally by the first place. Had a set amount of hours a month (55) that we were supposed to do. I should have known when we were told we could have the first couple weeks to get settled and not work, and they were calling the 2nd day wanting us to run new fence.. I should have packed my shyt and ran when they insisted on the entire farms electric fence be attached to my house (meaning also included on my bill)..somehow I ended up there 5 long miserable years working all month long , probably 55 hours a week, didn't have time to have an outside job, they didn't want to pay us a dime. Sad thing was, these weren't broke individuals... both of them were USDA inspectors.. no reason to treat us that way. Second Farm I learned my lesson and had EVERY THING written in a contract. \n\nIt was definitely a learning experience and still.glad I did it. Probably wouldn't pyss on those 2 people if I seen them on fire, but there's way more good people out there than bad. I don't know where you are located but here in WV, there are A LOT of huge family farms who's owners are getting up in age and their kids/grand kids don't want anything to do with the farm.. a lot have extra homes on them and those that don't almost all would be willing to place a mobile home on them just to have some one younger around to help them keep up the place. \n\nSee if your state has an agriculture newsletter... ours is called The Market Bulletin and it's often got work for rent farms listed every month.  Hell,  you might get lucky and find one that is willing to sell you a piece of their farm or leaves it to you when they pass. I've seen this happen more than once. Stop and ask at farms if you live near any.. worst thing they could say is no. Good luck!",

If you can\u2019t wait two years then you can\u2019t wait three years before harvesting fruit and some crops, you can\u2019t wait two and a half years to see your first calf born, you can\u2019t wait for that kind of time to get the investment it takes to start then you won\u2019t make it work period!!! I know I\u2019m being down but even though you want it you have to learn the patience before you can have it!  So while you wait, learn what you can and know that you are learning other things you will need but don\u2019t even know about!",

Barely got one leg out of the car and told the seller i'll take it :-D didn't even look at the house first. 5 years later, finishing the house this year, then moving on to rebuild the barn and getting some farm animals too. Just shared it hoping maybe you'll find some inspiration from it. Good luck in your journey of finding your perfect homestead :-)",

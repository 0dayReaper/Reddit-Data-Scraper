Your best bet is probably to put posted signs around the edge of your property, that way the people know it's a property that sees some use (since the signs will suddenly appear) and will know what direction not to shoot in.",

It makes a huge difference. \n\nControlled gunfire, I'd wander over and introduce myself - probably while armed. I've done this in the past, but it has a small (though non-zero) chance of danger though, so you do you.  \nOut-of-control gunfire, I'd wait until it stopped and then wander over and try to find where they're shooting.   \nOtherwise, as others have said your best bet is to mark your property.\n\nUltimately, if the shooting is being done in a controlled manner with an appropriate backdrop, then it wouldn't bother me at all. Uncontrolled shooting at an unsuitable backstop? Nope, gotta try and shut that down. A .30-06 will go right through a tree.\n\nYou might find [this discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdQE0yfDZDU) about intentional vs unintentional gunfire while out in the woods interesting - or you might not.",

It's likely just someone hunting varmints or deciding to target practice. \n\n\nIf you're worried about said folks firing too close to your property, then you can use bright paint around the property borders (to make it more visible, some states have a purple law) and then keep something loud, but noticeably man-made around so you can audibly make your presence known. This could be a chainsaw, car alarm, airhorn, bicycle horn, megaphone, etc.",

            "comment": "So I shoot a lot and there's probably zero chance of them hearing you while they're firing because usually they're rocking ear protection. There's active ear protection with some amplifiers and microphones and things like that but it's not really common for the go out shooting in the woods type so your best chance is relaying the information that you are where you are visually. \n\nThat kind of requires either making your place extremely obvious or finding that typical place where they go shooting and putting up a little information thing with a satellite view from Google Earth and a vector to your property from theirs so they know not to shoot in your direction. Basically just like an information stand you would find on a trail but this one shows where they are in relation to your place. \n\nThat's about the best you can do for now",

            "comment": "It would be a good idea to know the boundaries of your land and put flags or signs to alert someone in the area who may not know. It's also really good to talk to neighbors and find out who hunts. It's nice to know when they usually do so you can stay clear. This can also help you begin to interpret other random firing; on private property or your own.\n\n\nThis is important for people to think about though and something I see a lot in rural transition;  if one has grown up where there is not a lot of gunfire or when there is, it's related to violence, moving to the country can be traumatic.\n\nUsually one just needs to know hunting dates and it's pretty adjustable but a good friend of mine just moved to nice parcel but did not do all their homework around going to county meetings or being up on other transitions in the area so now her nearest neighbor (and three side boundary mate) will be a firing range. Now we are thinking of ways to sell baked goods or lunch or something - Sunday is their busiest day as people come after church and fire AKs for hours. It's very unpleasant but gotta be a bright side somehow - though of course, they will have a hard time to selling to anyone besides the gun club.",

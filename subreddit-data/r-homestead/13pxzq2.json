    "postText": "Hey everyone! I need a little bit of help if at all possible. I am looking to find somewhere in Europe that I can build a homestead. My problem is I am having a really hard time finding anywhere that doesn\u2019t have super strict building laws. These are the requirements I\u2019m looking for:\n\n- Not super strict building laws (I want to build my own tiny home with my own 2 hands)\n- Decent cost of living (Cheap land, etc)\n- Easy(ish) to obtain permanent residency (I am from the US) \n- Doesn\u2019t get horribly cold\n\nI would love somewhere not terribly far from the coast but I know that\u2019s a long shot. \n\nAny I for I could get at all would be extremely helpful! Thanks!!",

I\u2019ll have to look more. Thanks!",

I\u2019m also not really familiar with countries in Eastern Europe (EU and non-EU) but you could look there? Montenegro or Albania perhaps? Ireland has a good number of cheap old farm plots as well but I think cost of living there is very high, and you will have challenges getting residency everywhere in the EU of course (including Portugal). Some are easier than others if they have residency by investment. Good luck to you - I hope it all works out!",

            "comment": "It's my understanding that the building codes in Europe are even stricter.  They actually care about the safety of people not what giant contracting firms tell them is best for the bottom line.\n\nBut it's pretty hard to find places that don't have some kind of building codes for dwellings.  They want to know it's not going to collapse on your buddies when you have them over for the superbowl.  They want to know if your pal sleeps over because he's drunk that he won't wake up with the roof or a wall where his head used to be.  They want to know that if you have the family over for xmas they won't all wake up fried by inferior electrical work, tripped by twinkle lights.  They want to know your human waste is being properly treated so it's not running off into your neighbors' veggie patch or kid's sandbox.  Or that there's proper egress options if there's a fire.\n\nGetting pretty hard to find places that don't have codes anymore.  But rural US or alaska are probably a better bet than Europe.  Especially because even if you find a country that has lax codes, the odds of it meeting all your other requirements as well are pretty slim.",

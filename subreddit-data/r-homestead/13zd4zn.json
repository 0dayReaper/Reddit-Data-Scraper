    "postText": "We moved homesteads- It\u2019s not my first time gardening, but it\u2019s only my second time setting up a new bed and I\u2019m having a lot of trouble. We started with a modified lasagna method- pulled up all the grass/weeds underneath, laid down cardboard, compost, heavy mulch, and some compost on top to plant directly in. I\u2019ve planted directly in compost before with good success, but it was always compost from our family. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve bought compost. \n\nThis bed is bizarre. I planted salad greens three months ago and they sprouted then stayed in a state of stasis. I translate happy, healthy seedlings in their seed blocks and they just stop growing. Most of them start to get yellowing in the leaves. Nothing really died. These butternuts pictured were planted two months ago and they\u2019re still alive, but they haven\u2019t grown and look very unhappy. Even my beans are yellowing and halting growth! The only thing looking okay as far as not yellowing are the peppers and they\u2019re also not growing. \n\nAnyone have any ideas? I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s either a nutrient deficiency or I bought a batch of compost with herbicide in it. One is fixable but I have no idea where to start!",

Also, your planting media (is the mulch you've chosen) is all organic matter. You should mix this with native soil, which should help with soil stucture, cation exchange capacity, water holding capacity and balance much of your nutrient deficiency. As others have stated, your probably dealing with nitrogen deficiency, there is a scale of carbon to nitrogen and as you add leaf litter, bark etc the available nitrogen goes to the bacteria who are decomposing that organic matter. A quick solution would be to add a top dressing of grass clippings over the top, broadcasting manure, bone meal, fish emulsion or incorporating a bean crop that can fix atmospheric nitrogen.",

However it looks like op may have mixed the woodchips into the soil and that\u2019s never a good idea. Defeats the purpose of mulching in fact. Wood mulch is a ripoff.

There could be some other kind of nutrient deficiency but i dont think its nitrogen. Reason being the beans. I believe beans pull nitrogen from the air and put it into the soil. They are one of a few plants that help replenish nitrogen, which is why people usually rotate them with a nitrogen hungry plant. So even if you were nitrogen deficient i wouldnt be expecting the beans to be yellowing along with everyone else. My guess is water. I set up some new beds this year and bought miracle grow raised bed soil. It comes full of nutrients but im having the same problem you are. However i noticed this soil is not nearly as dense as the soil i bough from them in the past. Water goes through it like a sieve. Im guessing my problem is my soil isnt holding any water evening though im watering regularly. If it was later in the season it wouldnt be a problem but since the roots are still shallow my plants are drying out. Im guessing you have the same problem as me and that its water and not lack of nitrogen",

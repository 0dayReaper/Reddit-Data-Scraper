He\u2019s asking if the act of ramming was inspired by the animal, or if the animal was named for the act. \nLike, in the case of horses, surely they were named horses before we started \u201chorsing around\u201d (it\u2019s hard to image that we named them horses specifically BECAUSE they horse around). \nWith rams, does it offer a clue that we called the siege weapons a \u201cbattering ram\u201d and that some depictions of battering rams show a rams head on the business end? \ud83e\udd14\nPersonal conclusion: I think the animals were called rams, and then humans named the action after the animal, but this is uninformed speculation.",

Of course the fruit gets the name from the tree it grew on, so the whole line of etymology seems backwards.\n\nAlso, ram the animal predates the verb by centuries. The verb is attributed back to *c.*1300, whereas the name for the animal goes back at least to Old English.",

It makes sense that ancient people would name something they could eat first... I'd suspect people named orange trees after their fruit instead of the other way around. \n\nEspecially since the fruit are just called \"oranges\" and the plants \"orange *trees*\" instead of the edible bits being \"orange *fruit*\" growing from \"oranges\".",

            "comment": "My draft horse had a cribbing habit so I parked a tractor with bush hog in his pasture and came out to watch him crib on the tire of the JD and the other side would not quite lift but you see it shift up. Then he turned his massive head and neck to me and point his ears and lick his lips. Homestead life. He didn\u2019t mark the tread to much so I called it his pacifier and left him with it. No he never colicked , and his teeth didn\u2019t show any damage, \n only thing that suffered was the 2 inch boards on top of his stall. There were two stalls but Bud turned them into one big one when one day I came out and he had pulled the whole partition on one side of the post beam down in one piece and it was laying gently on the floor. Nothing was wrecked and we manhandled it out of one of the big stalls doors and hence Bud has a 16 by 20 suite with an exit and entrance. He liked it that way so we kept it . He stopped cribbing on everything but the tire as long as he could get to it. Kept his neck in good muscle too. Part of a successful stock keeper is keeping the animals happy and healthy. It is usually winds up cheaper too, less stress less vet bills. If that ram couldnt ram he gets as frustrated as a lion in the cage endlessly pacing. My trainer from Gap,, his farm is called Harmony Hollow his motto :  helping horses live in the human world. Long post but people need to know if you\u2019re gonna live the homestead life.",

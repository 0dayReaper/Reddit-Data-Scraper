I've done a bit of research, but there are plenty of options with questionable reviews. Does anyone have any recommendations for a unit that can do both or even one or the other?",

It'll also be handy when you get around to making jams, jellies, butters, and other preserves. I am aware of a [meat grinder attachment](https://www.amazon.com/Grinder-Attachment-Strainer-Accessories-Suitable/dp/B0B2BT6G8D) for the strainer, but I've never used it nor seen it used.",

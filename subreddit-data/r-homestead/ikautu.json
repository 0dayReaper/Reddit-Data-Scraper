A note: I didn't have any success with tomatoes of larger varieties, and settled on the smaller ones.\n2. When the potatoes are more or less the same length as the potatoes (and they grow like crazy, will catch up to tomatoes in no time), remove the tomato together with its roots and plant it close to the potato (for maximum survivability - you can also work with cuttings, but the survivability is low)\n3. Remove all leaves in lower portion of the both plants, leaving only a few of them in the top portion.\n4. Using a very thin and sharp knife (has to be sterile!) make a longitudinal cut on the stem of both plants. Do not remove any plant part, just make the cut in a way so that you can interlock both stems of the plant.\n5. Wrap them in wrapping foil and keep them out of direct sun for a week.\n6. After a week, check if the place where you made a cut has healed, and if so, remove the potato part above the graft, and cut off the tomato part from its roots\n7. Keep those out of direct sun for a week again. If the tomato part does not die, you're in the clear.\n8. Enjoy ketchup and fries after the growing season ;)  \n\n\nSo far I got a LOT of fruit from just 20 kgs of garden soil. And I'm also hopeful for some potatoes from the same plant soon.  \n\n\nYou can see the progress here, I will make another update after harvesting potatoes and tomatoes:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Horticulture/comments/i90ur0/my\\_pomtato\\_a\\_tomatopotato\\_hybrid\\_25\\_months\\_journey/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Horticulture/comments/i90ur0/my_pomtato_a_tomatopotato_hybrid_25_months_journey/)",

They proceeded to die back and have produced two tomatoes since the size of my eyeball. The squash were thriving and blooming but never fruited; hand pollinating didn\u2019t work and apparently the bees didn\u2019t like the look of it. Beans and carrots? \n\nThose were doing great in their trays until I moved them out to start hardening them. The first day they were kind of out in the open, it hailed unseasonably like a mofo and took out all the seedlings and the three squash plants that had decided to not be bitches. \n\nWhat is up, 2020? Why are you like this?",

It's 8ft at the deepest point. As for cleanliness, the idea is that the plants act as a filter to create a balanced natural environment. We have a gravel/plant shelf on each end of the pond, and a pump that circulates water from two drains on the bottom, up through the gravel beds. We also added healthy pond bacteria to break down organic matter, and we use pond dye to decrease the uv rays to reduce the chance of algae growth. Yes, it's basically a hole with liner and pumps! We also have a skimmer and aerator, along with the circulating water to keep things healthy and balanced.",

It's just a non-toxic blue dye that's safe for fish and wildlife (essentially food colouring) that helps to filter sunlight in the pond. The shade it creates blocks photosynthesis in any algae so that it doesn't grow or spread in the pond. We also like the way it looks :)",

So, you put the liner in the truck bed, install the pump with a section of hose going into the stock pot near the bottom. Put stockpot on burner. Second hose goes from near the top of the stockpot to the opposite end of the pool. add water. Turn on pump and burner. Heat water to your liking. make sure ice chest full of beer is easy to reach from inside the pool. Can use a thermometer to help regulate temps.",

Years ago a fishing buddy of mine got his BIL to dig him out a small 20'x20' x 4' deep pond with a 6' deep area near the dam he'd built. He wanted to raise tilapia to eat and bait fish both to sell and to use. He had a small leak but that's all it took to drain it almost all the way down. After a couple years of trying to use that powdered stuff, ~~(not dolomite but... Ah, I forget the name of it but it's what they use to stop leaks like that)~~ ***Bentonite***, he gave up and had his BIL come fill it back in. They sell the liner material at Home Depot and if I remember correctly it isn't nearly as expensive as the ~~Bridgestone (is it Bridgestone?)~~ ***Firestone*** stuff. Been about fourteen or fifteen years since I dealt with all this when I was into aquaponics but that's what I did for my little tilapia pond and that liner worked great.",

Have the 30mil liner sitting in the shop, just waiting for the under lay before we dig the hole. How thick did you go on your liner?\n\nOur excavator is going to drop the liner in the hole, but I'm wondering how many people you had to stretch out the liner. Our is pretty much the same size. Did you use the skid steer, or was it just human power? Any tips for the stretch?",

I looked through our receipts and it doesn't have the thickness listed, but my husband thinks it was 45mil- just off memory though. To get the liner laid we rigged up a metal pole through the centre of the roll, lifted it with the skidsteer, attached another pole to the loose end of the liner, and winched/drove it out with a side-by-side. It was still a ton of work and muscle to move a liner that size. Our liner was a fair bit bigger than the hole so we didn't have to worry about having it perfectly centered. Final tip- there will be folds and imperfections in the way the liner lies, and we just decided to live with it, because getting it perfect would be nearly impossible. Seriously good luck, I'd love to see pictures when it's done!",

We don't currently do any testing, and just treat it risk-wise like any natural body of water. No mammals like deer or beavers have access to it, and no runoff goes into it, which decreases the risks significantly.",

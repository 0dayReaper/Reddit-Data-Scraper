And way to go!!!\n\nMy grandma churned butter in the kitchen when I was little with one of those wooden churns and then later and electric one. Grandpa and I drank fresh buttermilk and it was AMAZING. Grandpa was born in 1906 and with an exception of medications needed now and then, they were pretty darned self sufficient!  I learned so much from them. Crazy. They never bought anything they weren\u2019t going to use till it died. (Like the toaster that caught fire because it was so damned old) No waste! \n\nWe would like to have a homestead of sorts in a few years. We don\u2019t partake in much dairy anymore due to the industry just being downright gross and cruel. Just wondered if you have to separate the calf from mum after the colostrum wanes??? Or do you keep them together for a while?  One thing that kills me about cows is that the mums call for the calfs after they\u2019re taken when regular milk comes in. They just disappear. It\u2019s the worst sound the mums make. And for weeks. It is most certainly distress. I do think there are ways of being as humane as possible as not everything is black and white. What are your thoughts???\n\n(We will probably forgo dairy and just do chickens unless there\u2019s a cow that needs rescued from somewhere. Then he\u2019d just be a big pet. Lol. Farm sanctuaries fascinate me. )\n\nCongrats again!",

They've got some hard core cleaning gear and practices in place to ensure they don't produce anything with harmful bacteria.\n\nCold jacketed tanks, very caustic acid wash downs, gloves anytime employees handle animals or products, stainless fittings on everything... they're proud of their product and have been working very hard to fight all the bad press raw milk gets from undisciplined producers.",

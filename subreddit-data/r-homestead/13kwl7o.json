    "postText": " \n\n### Egg Terminology\n\nLet\u2019s start with the basics. You can find caged, cage-free and free-range on store shelves and here\u2019s a rundown of those terms.\n\n***Caged Eggs:*** About 90% of eggs in the U.S. come from caged hens. The birds are confined to cages for their egg-laying lives and are given 67 square inches each. They eat a corn or soy diet.\n\n***Cage-Free Eggs:*** These birds have more room than caged hens, as they are each provided with less than 1 square foot. They are confined to the barns and eat a diet of corn or soy.\n\n***Free-Range Eggs*****:** These hens are allotted less than 2 square feet per hen which is more than caged and cage-free hens, but don\u2019t go outdoors too often. They are usually fed a corn or soy based diet.\n\n### So What Is Pasture-Raised?\n\nThese hens are allotted at least 108 square feet per hen. They eat a combination of carefully balanced supplemental feed and whatever they can find in the dirt when they go outdoors including grass, worms and bugs. They are able to leave the barns early in the morning and are called back before nightfall.\n\n [The Difference Between Eggs: Pasture-Raised, Caged, Cage-Free and Free-Range | Food Network Healthy Eats: Recipes, Ideas, and Food News | Food Network](https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/healthy-tips/2019/08/pasture-raised-eggs) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFree range means 2 square feet per hen?  1' X 2'?  Interesting terminology.  I have had hens that were 1' X 1'.  This gives them room to turn around?\n\nPasture raised is 108 square feet per hen? About 10' X 10'. I guess that is breathing room, but certainly not what I consider a pasture.",

The only birds I pasture raise are the meat birds i raise. It add so much to the nutritional value of the meat (they are New Hampshire reds)\n\nand by pasture raised, they rally do have a much bigger area. \n\nThe only birds I keep in runs full time are my silkies. They require a different diet and controlled breeding for different types of silkie colors. This allows me to keep them very healthy. The do get to go out for walks and I set up runs around our farm where they can be out but safe from predators. \n\nI offer most of my chickens very few restrictions and they enjoy life :)",

It doesn't mean that my free range chickens are living in small quarters.  This would be useful info for someone who was purchasing eggs from MalWart and wanted an idea of what conditions the chickens lived in, but isn't applicable to smaller egg producers.\n\nMy free range birds are exactly that- they are free.  They go into the barn when they want and come out when they want, and if they take a notion to walk into the woods and get eaten by a fox, they can go ahead and do that.  If I need to catch one, I do it at night when they are roosting.  The birds who roost up high in the rafters have much longer lives than the low roosters on the stall walls, because I can't catch them and neither does any other hungry beast.",

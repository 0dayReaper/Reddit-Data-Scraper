    "postText": "So my dad after 80 years of being indifferent gardening has decided he wants a green house, I'm soaked and I showed him how I made mine with an old car port frame and clear plastic with raised beds. He only wants a glass/Plexiglas or hard walled one so now I've got to figure out the most efficient, easiest and most cost effective way to build him one that he can walk into and not have to do too much kneeling to work in. Luckily my brother who lives and takes care of my parents will build it for him but he works an insane amount, while he can really build anything with the right instructions he wants it to be an easy project for him to build and maintain for our dad. I live on the other side of the country so I can't help physically but I can at least lead them to a decent idea/plan\n\nSo I figured I'd ask y'all if you have any good ideas on how to get this done for my pops.",

It\u2019s a messy job taking the down too.\n\nIf you want a cheap and easy ti maintain greenhouse I suggest looking on Facebook groups if any are being given away and just getting one.\n\nThe glass panels aren\u2019t expensive and can be bought at any glass shop. The frame is all you really need.",

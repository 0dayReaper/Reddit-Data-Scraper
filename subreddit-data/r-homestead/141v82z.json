Don't trim them.much until they have fruited, which doesn't happen the first year.\n\nAre they old plants? You may need to thin to promote the new cycle.\n\nI would soil test, improper pH and other conditions can cause lack of flowering.",

The ones on the right of the photo are just sending runners. Just finding it odd that plants from the same group of starts would behave differently.",

Or vice versa, plants age out of fruiting and just grow.\n\nHopefully you purchased locally and go perhaps talk to the growers but soil testing will let you know if that's an issue as the lack of flowering usually related to some other stress if it's not age.\n\nThe plants look healthy and that is good!\nSending out runners means they are thriving and those should produce well in the future given good soil conditions, last of last frost and enough (but not too much!)

Here goes:\n\n1. Japanese inspired: mayo, soy sauce, sesame oil, wasabi paste, ginger, bit of onion powder, garnish with crumbled seaweed flake pieces\n\n2. Mexican inspired: mayo, small can of diced chilies, cayenne powder, cumin powder, garlic powder, onion powder, salt mixture to taste, garnish with sliced green olives that are pimento-stuffed, top that all off with some of your favorite hot sauce\n\n3. (I have no cultural reference on this): mayo, garlic and onion powder, blue cheese crumbles, top with crispy bacon pieces (from that hog out back!!)\n\n4. Italian inspired: mayo, balsamic vinegar, basil finely chopped, dash of olive oil, oregano (fresh or dried), salt to taste, topped with a sliver of sun-dried tomato and a drizzle of olive oil (if the tomatoes come packed in oil, skip the last oil drizzle.\n\nThere, now you have a few ideas, in addition to the good ol' \"grandma's deviled egg recipe\" we all use. All of these can be added to or expanded. This is just basic framework for inspiration. Measure how you see fit based on the volume you plan to make and your own taste. \ud83d\udc14\ud83d\udc93\n\nEDIT: spelling",

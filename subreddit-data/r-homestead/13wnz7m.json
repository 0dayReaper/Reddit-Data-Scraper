I want to plant 4 cherry trees and I need advice because choosing the varieties.  \n\nI'm looking at bing, and rainier but the bloom early and being in the mountains I'm worried about frost ruining the harvest.  \n\nI've also considered Stella and montmorency as the bloom later.  But a friend said that bing tastes way better.  I'm curious what your all's advice is?",

            "comment": "Montmorency is a tart cherry so it won't have the taste of the other 3 that you mention.  It is a very good choice for pies and for jelly but won't be as tasty if you are eating it fresh.  I would probably include that one for sure.  Rainier is not crack resistant enough for humid areas.  My suggestion is to first contact the local extension agent and see what knowledge they have. The second suggestion is to look at some of the newer varieties out of Cornell.  (I think some of the varieties have Stella as a parent) Bing is not self fruitful and some of the newer varieties are.  That would be useful if the other cherry trees die for some reason.",

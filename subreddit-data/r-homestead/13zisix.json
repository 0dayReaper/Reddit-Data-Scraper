And raised beds because of our huge gopher population, not to mention making me feel a bit better about snakes \n\nEverything but the fencing and the 6 8\u2019 fence posts were scavenged or recycled. Built it with only a bit of help from my 3 yo, who was a trooper through the 95+ week I was getting the boxes done",

Though I\u2019m sure YouTube has videos on them \n\nBut I took 2x4s and cut them to the hight of my tin. Then a 2x4 for the top and bottom the length of the tin. Screwed them together and that was my frame work. With the 2x4 length being the inside board \n\nFrom there I split it in to 2-4 part and did more full length 2x4s for those. So you end up with 2x4s the full hight of your tin on the outside of your planter box. (On my 14\u2019 box\u2019s my outside boards were 4x4)\n\nThen I cut shorter 2x4s to go on the inside of the full hight uprights. This brought the the outside frame against the tin. Ten I screw the tin on. And boom you\u2019ve got a side. \n\nOn the ends I didn\u2019t do the double layered 2x4s as it\u2019s not getting as much pressure. I toenailed the 2x4s together and then screw the short ends of the planter boxes into the long sides. \n\nTopped them off with a pice of 1x4 that I 45d and it adds a lot of strength. Also on my longer boxes I took some 3\u2019 metal steaks and drive them in aft them middle of the box (on the inside) screwed them to the planter boxes and wrapped tie wire in a loop. Until I had about 5 wraps, then spun it like a cable to keep my boxes from bowing out. \n\nAs for soil, I took big rotting wood and filled the boots. Then some rough compost. Then 8-10 inches of soil that I bought. Sorry I can\u2019t give more help on detailed soil improvements as I just bought soil ready to go \n\n\nI tried to explain as best I could. But I know words don\u2019t do much justice. Please feel free to ask any questions you\u2019ve got or for clarification. I\u2019ll also put in a few more pictures, maybe they\u2019ll help \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/kYhO4v8",

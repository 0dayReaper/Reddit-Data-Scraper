    "postText": "I have been hesitant to get a dog because of how they often are with birds.  A few months back we were hit by predators and chose to get a LGD after failures with other things to attempt to protect with (lights, noise makers, geese, etc). None of that worked. \n\nWe lost more birds than I wish to admit to a fox (or more) and a raccoon.  \n\nOur LGD, Luna, a great Pyrenees has grown up a bit now.  Today I\u2019m not sure why I ever held off on getting one.  She has already kept the fox out multiple times, just today she ran a bear away from our fence line.  She is worth every penny spent on her!\n\nIf you are on the fence on getting one - do it.  Get one from a farm similar to yours in livestock.  This way the dog is familiar with the animals you keep.  We got ours from a chicken farmer who also kept goats.   We keep turkeys and goats but she understands the turkeys well and protects them as well as the ruminants.  \n\nShe even barks when there is movement or activity at the chicken coop not in the field (it is near it)\n\nI sleep better at night with her around.  There is more going on outside than I realized here before her.",

The dogs are smart and will protect anything you bring home, if they think it belongs there.  \n\nEven though we had chickens, ducks, turkeys, and guineas, when a couple juvenile peacocks ventured outside the coop, they were killed.  Until we introduced them to the dog.  Now they are protected.  That was our mistake, not hers.",

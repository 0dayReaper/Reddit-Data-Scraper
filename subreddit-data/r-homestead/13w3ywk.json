    "postText": "A few months ago, I made a post about edible tree leaves and had a lot of people ask for more so I drew 8 more, and then I tried combining them all into a little coloring ebook and since Ive gotten a lot of positive response to those and needed to make the pages fit and flow right and had a large gap on each one, so I ended writing recipes for each one while I was at it. Which, a cookbook wasn\u2019t what I was planning on doing when I got up this morning but here it is now.\n\nThe coloring/ebook is available on my Etsy, but most of the info minus the recipes is for free right here in this post.\n\nA tree once synonymous with the American countryside, American Elm (Ulmus americana) has multiple edible parts. The samaras (winged seed pods similar to maple spinners) and young leaves are both edible. The leaves have a slight mucilaginous texture (think okra). The inner bark has also been used as a traditional food source, but due to this and other species of elms native to the American Elms have been heavily effected by Dutch Elm disease, so the inner bark should be avoided and harvesting anything else should be only from healthy populations. You should also help propagate any populations you take from.\n\nChinese Toon (Toona sinensis), or xi\u0101ng ch\u016bn \u9999\u693f in its native China is a mainstay in several Asian cuisines.  Xi\u0101ng means aromatic and gives away the selling point of this tree as an edible. The young leaves are often consumed for their unique flavor that is a combination of onion, garlic and shallot. The flowers are also edible, and are usually consumed when they\u2019re young and have a more mild flavor.  \n\nIn addition to edible leaves, the Eastern Cottonwood (Populus deftoides) has buds that can be harvested in early spring before they fully open and have a pleasant balsamic like scent. The inner bark has also traditionally been used as a survival food. The barks and buds blabber traditionally been used by tribes such as the Haudensaunee, the Mohegan, the Kakota, Arapaho, etc.  for it\u2019s pain relieving and anti inflammatory effects.\n\nLike other Ash trees, the introduction of Emerald Ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) has done considerable damage to its population. I choose Green Ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) for this list because unlike many other American Ash species, it is at least not currently listed as endangered but any harvesting should be done cautiously and respectfully from healthy populations. The seeds can be eaten raw or collected and ground into flour and young leaves can also be eaten raw. \n\nA very common fruit tree that\u2019s rarely appreciated, the Hackberry\u2019s (Celtis occidentalis) name comes from the Old English haecce meaning bird, which is predominately what eats its fruit and spreads this tree. The berries (technically dropes or stone fruit), unlike most fruit, are calorie dense and high in fat, carbohydrates and protein that are easily digestible raw.   On top of that, the young leaves are completely edible.\n\nOne of the more well known examples of cauliflory (flowers growing directly from branches and trunks), Redbuds put on an early display of bright edible flowers before it\u2019s leaves even appear. Less known is that the seeds, twigs and leaves are also edible and can be tapped for syrup. It\u2019s sometimes called the love tree due to its bright red flowers and heart shaped leaves.\n\u202aRedbuds are also nitrogen fixing trees, enriching the soil around them.\u202c\n\nAlso called Juneberries or Saskatoons, with well known tart edible berries. The young shoots and leaves are also fully edible, as well as the seeds that can be ground as a flour or used as a thickener. The name serviceberry is thought to have derived from the arrival of the berries in spring serving as a reliable marker for when the ground was thawed enough for burial services to be held in early North American settlements.\n\nUncommon for trees,  Spice Bush (Lindera benzoin) has berries with spicy, aromatic flavor similar to a combination of cloves, cinamon and allspice. The twigs barks and leaves are also edible, with a slightly more citrusy taste than the fruit that leads to them often being used as a spice from which it gets it\u2019s name. It is the primary host plant of the spicebush swallowtail butterfly.\n\nAll of these can be tapped for syrup, although Green Ash and Serviceberry are the only two with a notable history of ever being used as such.",

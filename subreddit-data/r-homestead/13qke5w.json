Will it grow,  maybe, but there is a bunch of research out there around plant vigor and seed piece health and size relating to yield potential and plant health.  you really want a seed piece big enough establish a healthy plant before it runs out of carbohydrate, 2oz is about right.  I work in the potato bizz, so that has been my experience.",

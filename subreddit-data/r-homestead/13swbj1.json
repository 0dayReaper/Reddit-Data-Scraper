    "postText": "I have been working on a bulk feeding storage solution for my horse feed. I used a clean ibc tote, and a small auger for drilling in fertilizer around trees. 3 inch to 2 inch fernco adapter, a 2inch pvc wye, and a 2 inch clean out. It works really well. Will make it easier on the wife to feed the mares in the afternoon.  I cut down a drill bit extension to give me a bit of clearance.  The clean out cap is turned inside out, and i drilled a hole in the cap , with the extension it keeps the auger from going to far into the tote.\n\nI weighed out the amount of feed and marked a fill line in a 5 gallon bucket.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjj9jz2cia2b1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=859c1cd815a95959a5cef54f75d1e237fefb1842\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ixtzpz2cia2b1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8d17be237137b5f5479cf8fd6cb62a67c218e6cf\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sloztx2cia2b1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=49aa54db9ff166792f23cceb47333c0a0ec5f14b",

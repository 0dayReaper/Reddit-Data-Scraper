If you planted enough you could harvest enough to make a side dish almost daily while they're flushing.  Cherry and Grape variety tomatoes would likely ripen with plenty of time in your zone.  Potatoes will grow just about anywhere.\n\nBut if you don't have a camera pointed at the porch, there are 2 things to consider.  1) it's very likely some asshole will come along just as everything ripens and leave you with all the work and none of the reward.  2)  In the wrong neighborhoods, a pretty/edible front garden is just a target for drunk assholes to take a leak.  So if you do still have fruit by the time they ripen, WASH IT WELL.  Again both of these can be mitigated with the help of a very obvious camera or sign.  But it's something to consider before planting edibles in a front yard.",

            "comment": "Dwarf cherries, urban apple trees, plums, or black/rasp/boysenberries.  Any one of these should fit the spot and provide.  The apples are advertised as a thin sparsely branched tree that has a 2-4 foot wide space and gets 10 ft tall, comes in; red, blush, green, and gold.  Sour cherry is the typical choice as they're usually shrubs, there are a few sweet cherry dwarfs.  Plums are shrubs and are beautiful with their flowers smell amazing and they tend to bear heavy so long as you have at least 2 cultivars.  The berries are cane growing plants, black is usually the only one with thorns, that can spread out their football over that space, second year fruiting on canes.",

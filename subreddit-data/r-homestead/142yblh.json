I think it came from something we intentionally planted several years ago that I don't remember but the seeds from one of the fruits must have washed down the hill (only a few feet away) and taken root. For the past 3 years it has spontaneously \"come back to life\" in the summer and just keeps growing and then we cut it all down in the fall. Before this I never realized there were annual tomato plants or that there were determinate or indeterminate tomato plants. I have no idea what variety the plant is exactly aside from producing cherry-like tomatoes, but it is always kind of exciting when it shows back up the next year. In fact mine just showed up again a few days ago, but it is nice to get a few cherry tomatoes right off the vine each summer without ever putting in any effort. I am sure that what you have is a tomato plant because in the right conditions, even without effort, they can pop up and grow very quickly. \n\nAlso, [you can tell it's a tomato plant because the way it is.

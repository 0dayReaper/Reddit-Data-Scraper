How do you even hill each plant? I plant 600-700 hills a year by hand and what you\u2019re showing is triple my spacing. I\u2019m 12\u201d spacing minimum. Sometimes 18\u201d",

How many lbs or how many potatoes are you getting per plant?? I feel like someone just slipped me a secret note about potatoe growing. I\u2019ve been growing potatoes for almost 30 years and thought myself somewhat of an expert. I never would have thought to plant that close.",

We average approximately 3-4  bushels , on the higher end with varieties like katahdin. Hard to decipher per plant yield as it\u2019s a solid row of spuds with no spaces. Bear in mind we have no seeds costs as we replant last years spouts. Colorado potato bugs are our nemesis , they\u2019re bad here but diligent hand picking works. I\u2019ve tried 8-12\u201d spacing but yield was lower. Hilling a crowed row works well. Crowded plants make harvesting easier too, a continuous row of beautiful spuds.",

I plant LaRattes every year, wide bed style, 3-2-3-2-3 pattern, 8\" on center.  \n\nAs long as I hill early while the tops are still short there's no problem getting the new dirt around the stems in the middle of the row, and the close spacing means the plants both support each other and also shade out more weeds. \n\nLaRattes really do look like a mouse family when you dig them, the potatoes are all snuggled into each other in a nest-like cluster. Because they're smaller and lighter, if your soil's nicely friable you can often gently uproot the whole plant. By planting close, you're concentrating the tubers all in one zone, making harvesting *really* quick.  \n\n\nI might be decreasing size a *little* by doing this, but I want potatoes I can cook whole anyway - it's the \"pop\" of the skins when you bite down that's half of the attraction.\n\nPlanting this way with big blocky types will definitely give you smaller potatoes, but again, I like it that way. Bintjes and Carolas are both better small imo.",

That\u2019s the cost of the chick, the 6 months to grow them out, feed for 3 years, cost of eggs cartons and some of my time. Also I get a couple pounds of chicken meat at the the end that can be factored in. Each hen generates $86 profit just off the egg sales over the 2.5 years, at 4 eggs a week. At $5 a dozen sale price. Meat birds cost me $11ish a bird to raise and butcher. Sales are $15-20 so $4-9 profit per bird. Firewood can be moved as well. Here it\u2019s $120 a log cord delivered and $210 bulk sales split. Having land logged is about the fastest infusion of cash. The biggest things to watch out for are start up cost and how you value you\u2019re time. Buying a $25000 tractor and a $30000 processor before you sell a stick of wood is a recipe for disaster. Same with chickens. Build the market slow and figure out what sells.",

I think people overlook how vast of a difference there is in the amount of labor input needed to make money from any given amount of farm products depending on knowledge, skill, innovation, and finding out what niches you can create demand for in the market. Grow specialty crops, increase diversity, bring interesting produce to restaurants and see if any would have you grow some for them next year. Sell cut flowers, get an incubator and hatch chicks, start a native plant nursery, consider applying for grants if you find and test a good idea that could use an upgrade in infrastructure etc. if you get really skillful and experience in any of these niches, you\u2019ll grow a name and people will refer to you for it. Your question is a good one and it shows where the term homesteading can fall short. To make it economically viable and supportive of community in today\u2019s world, you gotta build on a skill that the world values and needs",

I wasn\u2019t going to spend $350 plus per panel so managed to get used panels for about $80 per unit back in 2016. They are still performing perfectly to this day. I have seen in excess of 8kw generated from them on a cold sunny day which is more than they are actually rated for. I looked at Victron kit initially but the price was crazy compared to what else was out there. I settled on the MPP range of inverters and they have both been bullet proof since I installed in 2019. I made sure to buy the genuine Taiwanese model not a cheap knock off. I went for 25kwh of lead acid as lithium was too pricey when I installed. All in all it worked out to be about $17k \nI have a few videos up on my solar install if you want to take a look?\n[@farmvillacampagna](https://youtu.be/CGIbZCnIJRc)",

Once you're using your homestead to generate outside revenue, you're a commercial farm.  And the only way to be cost neutral is with outside revenue.  So: farming.  Which isn't a dirty word, and there are all sorts of ways to do it.  It's not like there's a binary choice between living in The Shire and living in an Iowan monoculture.  But revenue is revenue, and it makes you a commercial farm.",

If you are watering them all the same sid this one hole have clay or some other non well draining soil? Did you get a little generous with the root ball slicing. Was your root ball hole big enough? Sometimes they just can't take the transplant shock, honestly one out of five is not bad.",

I use it by the pallet on the sports field I take care of but have also used it a lot on my raised bed gardens. It makes a big difference. Complete side note: Justin Timberlake is a partial owner in it as well.",

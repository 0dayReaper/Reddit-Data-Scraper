            "comment": "Cats like cougars or bobcats tend to eat the stomach area, especially organs like the liver first. They also like to pull out the hair where theyre eating around. You would find tufts of hair on the ground all over the place. \n\nThe torn up flesh on the rump indicates a canid species. They tend to tear into the large muscles first. Most likely wild dogs, but could be a very small pack of wolves, though not as likely. Survey the area and see about tracks. If you find huge dog tracks, think wolves.",

This definitely isn\u2019t it. \n   \nDogs (including coyotes and wolves) start at the soft tissues, esp. lips and anus.

Lmao, no.\n\nYou will see a pack of domestic dogs chase deer here, and they only reason they catch them is because the deer gets hit by a semi on I80, or caught up in a fence somewhere. And if they are caught up in a fence? They go for the deers entrails while the deer sits there alive and kicking. Then they don't eat much of anything either and just leave the deer sitting there gutted after it quits moving.\n\nThey don't hunt for food. They hunt because they are someones well fed, bored, pets that got loose...\n\nAnd that's why it's legal to shoot a dog harassing wildlife that is not wearing a high vis vest here.",

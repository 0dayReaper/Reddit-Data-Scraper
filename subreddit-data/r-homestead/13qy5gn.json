    "postText": "We bought two baby turkeys the other day. They are in a brooder with two baby ducks, with pine needles covering the bottom. They\u2019ve been eating game bird crumbles I think. When we went to look at the a few minutes ago I noticed like they\u2019re anus was bleeding and protruding or swollen. Both turkeys. I can\u2019t confirm through a google search what is wrong with them. I have a picture of it but I\u2019m not sure if I can post it. Has anyone else dealt with this? Thanks I\u2019m advance",

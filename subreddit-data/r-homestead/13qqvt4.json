    "postText": "After some advise with our neighbours sheep. When we moved to our property 2 years ago it looks like the previous owners didn't mind the neighbours sheep grazing on their land. Or just kept quiet about it for an easy life. When we first moved in before repairing the boundary fences there could be as many as 14 of their sheep on our property. \nWe asked them to remove them which they attempted once but only managed to get about 6. The others soon came back and the neighbours did not make any effort to remove them or keep them from our property.\nAfter all the fences where mended we didn't have any of their sheep for maybe 6 months after this period. \nFor context the neighbours have 3 acres and somewhere between 35-40 sheep. They are overshocked and even in the summer when the grass is growing fast they do not have enough grass for their sheep. They also do not shear their sheep with most the them having between 2-3 years worth of wool some maybe more. They have poor husbandry and do not seem to care about the welfare of their animals. After about a year some of the neighbours sheep had fly strike.They where not going to be treated for this. My partner made an anonymous complaint to the farming regulator in New Zealand. They were later treated and some of them were shorn.\nOver the last 18months we have periodically had 2 or 3 of their sheep pushing through the fence to graze on our grass has they have none of their own. We live in  New Zealand and the standard fencing is 7 wires with wooden battens.\nWe have tried to be pleasant and neighborly. When asking them to keep the stock on their property. However they make no effort to do this. When moving one of their sheep from our property my partner was hit in the face and her noses was broken by one one of their sheep. \nWe have spoken to them about there lack of grass and being overstocked. They have not taken any notice and made excuses for having so many sheep.\nMore recent after lambing their lambs who can fit through the fence have been grazing at our property. We moved them back to the neighbours. My partner let them know we had put them in the paddock closest to their house. This however end with my partner getting verbally abuse and the father and son threatening me. \nEssential their sheep are starving and going to great efforts to get to our grass. While I feel sorry for their sheep we are adequately stocked with 4 beef cattle and a small flock of sheep. In the summer we have more than enough grass to feed extra mouths but in the winter we can not have extra stock on our property other wise our animal will go short.\nI'm sick and tired of their response, attitude, not taking any responsibility and having their stock on our property. One option could be replacing the fence or using an electric fence. This is however exspensive. What other options are there? It feels like it's a waist of time talking to them or putting their stock back as the weaned lambs are small and skinny and just return. \nAny advice will be greatly appreciated. Apologies for a long post.",

Release them out into a nearby field and make anonymous complaints about loose animals. $500 for a first offence up to $20,000 for repeat. Just keep kicking their animals off your property and calling in complaints. Eventually they will have them taken away. Or get rid of them themselves.",

This is a big hassle but, I would--and I am getting very creative here (maybe not financially justified)--get a few lambs from an auction and bring them home to accommodate them on your property so that it is obvious you have sheep in addition to what you have. You will have a bill showing ownership--not registered animals, nothing fancy. \n\nNow when the neighbours' stock make the next incursion, 2 lambs are left behind somehow in with yours. Out-of sight is good; but whatever. Make sure everyone is sheared to the same degree; keep up hoof trimming.  Fatten up for a month or two and then send the best 2 of the now 4 to the freezer. Immediately \"adopt\" two more from the neighbour from the next incursion--rinse, repeat.\n\nYou guys  (N.Z.) are polluted with sheep so I don't know if you could keep funneling them off to auction for a decent profit or what works best. Make a few bucks maybe? They may not even notice the shortfall.\n\nOtherwise, do the legal route and continued bad relations guaranteed with zero upside for you. This way there is a smidgen of compensation. Oh well...cheers.",

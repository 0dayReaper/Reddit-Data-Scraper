    "postText": "We already filed for a tax extension because we wanted to do more research on what exactly is deductible if anything.  I work full time and my salary pays for our homestead in Kentucky.  We do have the agricultural exemption which helps with our property taxes.  We made some large purchases last year, like building a new barn.  It seems like a lot of tax preparers are unfamiliar with small farm deductions.  The farm doesn't turn a profit, but we do sell eggs and herbs/veggies to help offset costs.  Any suggestions or knowledge on this is appreciated.",

            "comment": "In order to take tax deductions (as a farm business) you need to actually run a farm business and show that you are trying to reasonably turn a profit every year. \n\nWhat you are describing is a homestead, or hobby farm. The IRS does not allow deductions for hobby farms. Google hobby farms and IRS for more info.",

So if you made $1000 you can only deduct $1000. \n\nOn the opposite side I file a schedule F and can roll losses from year to year. Like you said you have to be in it for profit though. I would imagine you can only show a loss for so many years before the IRS comes knocking.\n\nA good tax/cpa person is well worth the cost.",

All my coworkers have a misconception of how easy it is. We had to create an llc for a farm for some deductions on taxes. This admittedly is only going to work for awhile as we need to make a profit at some point. But we are working on that. \n\nWe did qualify for the farm tax exemption. But we had to submit a form with a business plan to make a profit. I've been told this is going to be harder to qualify for because so many people have been taking advantage of it. Have yet to use it though.\n\nBut as others have stated if your just doing it for yourself I doubt much will qualify. You can probably get some deductions if you create an llc.",

They work better than any of the other solutions I\u2019ve tried. \n\nA couple of hints\u2026get them in as soon as you see a tunnel. Older tunnels don\u2019t seem get used very often and I\u2019ve found that if you don\u2019t catch one in the first few days, go ahead and move it to another location if needed. The second tip is that after setting the trap, make sure the trap is sitting very loosely in the soil. Rock it back and forth to loosen it to where it is just sitting on top of the soil and not lodged tightly into the soil.\n\n[Scissor mole traps](https://www.amazon.com/Garsum-Plunger-Reusable-Quick-Scissor/dp/B08HRZQSYB/ref=sr_1_17?crid=YAWRKV3Q2KIG&amp;keywords=Mole%2Btraps&amp;qid=1684503114&amp;sprefix=mole%2Btraps%2Caps%2C106&amp;sr=8-17&amp;th=1)",

It will thin out babies in the holes, then use traps to get the bigger ones if they don\u2019t fertilize the soil where they were.",

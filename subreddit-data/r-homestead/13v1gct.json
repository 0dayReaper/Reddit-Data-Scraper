There are are areas where you can measure animals per acre and others where it\u2019s acres per animal.  Most areas 1 acre won\u2019t support 1 cow. Might be able to support a couple sheep or goats. Most likely any large grazing animal would be on hay most of the year in a pastor that small.",

Luckily, we have a well to provide constant water for our sheep to keep them alive. If need be, we can set up a sprinkler system to water the area we just planted seed at. Texas is crazy weather wise though. The ground here is really rocky, but we recently cleared about 40 acres of cedar trees so we can plant some grass seed to try and keep from buying hay. The hay round hay bales here are between $145 and $160 each. Our grass was really thick just above the knee high in the original pen, but like I said they ate it all quickly. The 4 acres we originally fenced in was completely full of grass. Now its all dirt. They actually began eating parts of the cedar trees. We have been getting a lot of rain recently, which is out of the ordinary and is helping to bring back some grass.  It's actually pouring down right now.",

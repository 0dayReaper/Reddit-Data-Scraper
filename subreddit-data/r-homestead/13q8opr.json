    "postText": "Figured this might be a good place to ask. I've got some beef fat rendering into tallow, had it in the oven at about 230\u00b0F for 3-4 hours. Looks about 75% melted but there's a good bit of chunks left (i ran the fat through my meat grinder first - figured it would even it all out and help it render a little quicker) \n\nI was going to shut it off for the night and let it sit in the oven until tomorrow, then pick it up again - started too late in the day today. \n\nI ladled out what had already melted/rendered from the pot into a jar and got about a pint then i saw it start separating at the bottom - about a quarter cup worth of water(?) at the bottom separated out. I didn't add any water or anything at all to the fat so I'm not sure if it's just an \"it needs to cook longer\" thing or what. Any insight?",

It should be soft enough at room temperature to spoon into jars.\n\nFYI - The \"best\" fat for tallow is from around the organ meats. Just a better quality end product than body fat",

            "comment": "Unrelated to whether or not you need to boil the tallow for longer, All fleshy part of the body have water in it. That seems to be a major part of what confused you. What you are seeing is in fact water, with impurities that have settled out of the fat. If you want to optimize impurity settling, After rendering and allowing to mostly cool, way before it gets solid, put the tallow in an insulated container so the top cools faster than the sides. It's the same concept as with making clear ice. By forcing directional cooling from top to bottom, you are giving impurities towards the bottom of the 'cake' maximum time to settle. This should result in a layer of exclusively water and impurities that can be used to make broth for soups/ cooking rice and almost all impurities in the fat in a location where you can scrape them out.",

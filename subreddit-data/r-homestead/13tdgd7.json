I\u2019ve even seen it thrashing into the sides of the cages I have my breeders in and my girlfriend doesn\u2019t care.\n\nFigured I\u2019d update the post. I broke things off after she said she couldn\u2019t give the dog to her mom (who has asked to keep her multiple times) and doesn\u2019t want to keep her dog leashed, or even in a collar because it \u201cmakes her uncomfortable.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a shame since the dog issue was the only problem but it\u2019s not worth playing 2nd fiddle to a dog.",

How she deals with this is going to make or break a relationship.  \n\nShe needs to understand the dog is being a big problem, he\u2019s tearing the house apart and trying to tear apart your animals.  The dog isn\u2019t the problem, it\u2019s how she handles the dog that is the problem.   You need to have a sit down talk and tell her this is only going to end in tears.  Doggo needs a responsible owner that sees its behavior as a problem.  Dogs don\u2019t rip apart doors by accident, it\u2019s a behavioral issue showing up, and now she needs to show up for her dog.  It needs training so doggo can be left in the house, and the yard, without destroying furniture or animals.",

Then I met a guy with a homestead with chickens. My dog attacks chickens, so she became an inside dog &amp; if she went outside she had to be on leash with one of us. My guy and I agreed on this. Years later, we're married with kids.

I had a purebred APBT,  papers and lineage as far back as anyone could want. And she absolutely ADORED my chickens. Chicks and juveniles more than anything. She genuinely saw them as \"hers\", and not in a bad way. I free range..and she would lay outside in the sun, almost always positioning herself between the flock and the nearest woodline.  And I pitied even the smallest perceived threat to her babies.. chipmunks, squirrels, coons, opossum, skunks, foxes, and coyotes ... NOTHING came near my birds when she was alive. It gets cold here in winter, got to the point where I had to buy her a dog coat and made her a heated room right outside the coop bc she didn't even want to come inside at night. She was hands down one of the best Farm dogs I've ever owned. I realize she was most likely the exception to the rule, and I also raised her from 4 weeks old. I also had a Pyr years before her that killed my entire flock of 63 birds in about 35 minutes when I went inside to make a phone call(he was 4, Farm raised, working line, by all rights should have been a helluva farm dog and instead was a helluva headache)  \n\nSo all that just to say, yes breed/breeding has A LOT to do with temperament and personality... but training and daily interactions with ANY dog, of ANY breed, are going to influence that dog more. \n\nOP: you have a city dog and a city girlfriend and need to upgrade to the better, more equipped Farm versions  \ud83d\ude09",

I call it their switch because normally they are affable, sweet &amp; loving, then the switch flips and they lock onto a kill &amp; they are off.\n\nBoth were large dogs (80+lbs). One was a lab/chow mix (looked like a big lab at first glance) and the other one is a lab/pit mix. Both were willing to kill anything smaller than them. \n\nMy lab/chow was able to determine house animals were to be left alone (cat, chickens, ducks) but he would kill anything else that got in the yard (opossums, raccoons, rabbits, cats that aren\u2019t ours). And he hated little kids. HATED them. I raised him with older kids (teen/preteen) from puppyhood, so he wasn\u2019t tortured by little kids.\n\nSo what did we do? Kept him behind a fence or on a leash. We only let him loose in the back of the property. Friends with little kids were not invited over. If we were out &amp; about, he wore a soft muzzle.\n\nMy current dog, Loki, loves all humans, but any animal smaller than him is worth killing. Same deal. Fences, leash, muzzle. Is loose away from homes only. Kills anything in the yard &amp; can\u2019t differentiate pets from non-pets. Our fowl/hens are in a fully enclosed pen. Chainlink dog runs with wire floors under the dirt &amp; wire ceilings. It keeps raccoons &amp; Loki out. He has killed 5 chicks, but I\u2019ve gotten to him before he killed hens on 2 occasions went the gate was left open.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried letting him watch us raise the baby chickens but if I looked away it was in his mouth. Tried getting him to relax around our cat, nope. \n\nSo, I think some of them are just born with it.",

Or kills the neighbor's livestock? As the homeowner, could you be sued? How much are hospital bills and \"pain &amp; suffering\"?  Might you have to sell the land to pay for the settlement? God forbid this dog kills a child, could you go to prison? How much of a potential liability are you willing to risk?",

I have a bandog and Malinois. Both have extreme prey drive. They would kill every animal on the farm if they could. They were e collar trained before we moved to the farm. But we reinforced what was and was not acceptable.",

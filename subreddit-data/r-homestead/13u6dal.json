What kind of things have you added (or want to add) to your property for fun?\n\nWe\u2019ve done a few projects so far - built a dirt racetrack, a misting sunbathing platform, an axe throwing target, a shooting range and an outdoor screen/projector for movies. We\u2019re currently working on creating a zombie hunt - targets in the woods to shoot at with paintball guns while riding atvs. At some point I\u2019d love a nice outdoor kitchen.",

Views nice too.\n\nMake random tree houses throughout your forest: Very useful for blinds when hunting but if you have hiking trips or want to go camping, just make a few spread around and you'll then have a nice place to set up for the night.\n\nBurying loot boxes or caches: More along the lines of prepper activities but they do come in handy when you're out pretty far from the stead and you need some food or water or even medical. Just make sure you don't bury them too deep or put them in a hollow tree.\n\nStructures or buildings: Make them out of wood or perhaps metal and just have some random little shacks around. They come in handy for storage or perhaps even an extra housing for animals.\n\nThat's all I have for right now, take care.",

My husband does the maintenance so I can\u2019t say what exactly is done, but I know it\u2019s minimal. There\u2019s vegetation, but I\u2019ve no idea about additional filtration. Look at your county extension office website, they\u2019ll have a section for building/maintaining ponds in your area, along with which kinds of fish to stock. Our pond brings us a lot pleasure. Feeding the fish/turtles is highly entertaining, we fish it for fun on occasion, and I got a paddle boat for Christmas last year which has been great for spending quality time together. I got ducks when we first moved in, but something in the woods kept murdering them.",

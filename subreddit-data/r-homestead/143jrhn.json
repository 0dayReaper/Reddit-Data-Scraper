    "postText": "I don't have livestock, but I have neighbor cows on 3 sides of my property. Has anyone made any homemade bait stations for fly bait? I need to provide an overhead to keep it dry, as we get loads of afternoon downpours through the summer. I also will need to make a lot of them because of how much fence line there is. Any advice on how to make a relatively easy bait station is appreciated. ",

It's not my full time job, also the in-laws \"help\" so it's generally nothing is really clear about the history and current state of each tree.\n\nis there known software to help me organise this? I want to keep notes about trees' health, production and current treatments \u2014 what's been applied and what's pending.",

After that just keep an journal with a dedicated section for each tree.  My apple orchard only has 10 trees but I plan on adding a second pecan orchard this fall so I will be getting there at some point.",

That seems high to me\u2026 I really don\u2019t have *that* much to sell when cukes are 2/$1. \n\nThere\u2019s also a waiting list at one of the markets. Always a plethora of soap, candle, and jewelry makers there tho.",

My wife and I manage a booth on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and we extend our presence to two booths on both Saturday and Sunday. Collectively, we participate in seven markets per week. I do the weekday markets and we each run a booth on sat and sun.  \n\n\nWith an entrance fee of $50-$60 per market, it can be quite cost-effective, provided that these markets generate enough footfall and you have an ample stock of products to sell. My Friday market is in Orange County, NY, which only charges $35. This market is organized by the local chamber of commerce and is typically more affordable than those run by private organizations.\r  \n\r  \nDespite lower attendance, this market has proven fruitful for my business, allowing for a slower pace and the opportunity to build trusting relationships with our customers. Indeed, markets can serve as excellent platforms to expand your business, network with other producers, and cultivate trust with your clientele.\r  \n\r  \nFarmers' markets, in particular, are fascinating places. They're like a melting pot of unique characters, which could easily inspire a sitcom. Many vendors have claimed the same spots for years, becoming extremely territorial. The pandemic led to the departure of some longstanding vendors, opening up opportunities for newcomers like me to secure some prime locations.\r  \n\r  \nOver the past three years, I have been documenting my experiences and observations while selling at these markets. From engaging stories to valuable data points, I have assembled a rich collection. I hope to one day consolidate all this information into a comprehensive guidebook, beneficial to both vendors and customers. I can't help but wonder if there's an audience out there interested in a book of this nature.",

Given that it pertains to farmers markets, I worry it might not be well-received. However, if there's interest in learning about market strategies and tactics, I'd be more than willing to share the insights I've gained over time ,if anyone had any specific questions. I will continue to compile data, when the book comes together I will post about it.  \n\n\nAnecdotally, an amusing observation I've made is that while people are quite vocal about favoring minimal packaging, they often struggle when it comes to actually purchasing unpackaged goods! We've found a solution in opting for FSC-certified paper that's printed with vegetable-based ink, all of which is compostable!  \n\n\nIt's important to note, though, that these strategies have worked in my specific locale and circumstances may vary elsewhere.",

Thanks for your reply I think those observations are quite worthwhile, especially because a lot of people look at it with rosetinted glasses. I myselfd are interested in homesteading with a specific crop (due to familyknowledge) but I am astounded by all the people that I meet that its just putting in some seed in the ground or that have started growing that crop and are said that they don't succeed or can't sell it. what are you strategies?",

I know another one where you pay for the booth space and they also took an additional percentage of your profit if you sold items that weren't food. A small one I did charged $20 every time you showed up (it was less if you committed to the entire summer, but it was a long commute for me so I couldn't make it every week). The big main one doesn't advertise what it charges to attend, other than that they charge a $20 no show fee if you don't come when you're supposed to. I do know from talking to other vendors that they are the most expensive ones, I would guess it's probably more than the $50-60 your farmers market is charging. The catch is that every vendor I've talked to said that market draws the biggest crowd, but very few people actually buy things there. They go to window shop and get dinner from a food truck. The small market I did was in the same town and even though it was insanely boring most of the time because it didn't draw that big of a crowd, everyone who showed up was there to buy and I always made decent money when I went. If you can talk to vendors who are in those markets already, and see if you can get an idea of which ones are worth it. You have to judge markets based on the kinds of customers they draw, and that's often hard to do without already being a vendor. I will say that without any other data to go off of, the one with the waiting list is probably the most worth it. The shows we've done that have waitlists have pretty much all been our most lucrative.",

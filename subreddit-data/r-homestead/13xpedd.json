Come spring we had a lot of other projects, cleaning the goat pen, under rabbits and the chicken coop just put to name a few. We will be using straw as a weed beadier this year. I can just till that in or use the tractor to rake it out for composting. It\u2019ll properly end up being cheaper too.",

It's a great opportunity to try and ID what is out there to help determine soil health but I'd encourage you to reach out to the local university extension service for soil testing and tips on your area. Companion planting and using green manure like  Vetch have helped regenerate three acres for my purposes.\n\nPigs are a wonderful asset to garden development because they also do all the digging and turning of soil as well as fertilizing! We just have one now to keep up on some maintenance and help with all the scraps but used about seven pigs seasonally for two years to open up six planting beds. They took care of invasives like Buckthorn in one go where as the goats take several cycles to catch up.",

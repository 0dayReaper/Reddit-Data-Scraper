    "postText": "We have three \"kiddie pools\" the ducks go to. My wife has been dumping them for some time. That's strenuous and messy. \nI purchased a HF transfer pump, battery operated type. \nI'm using it to pump the pool water every two or three days, one pool per day, to my new pecan tree. If you have a similar scenario I'd get one of these. I opted for the harbor freight one which is a miluakee clone ($150 less). The rubber impeller handles the brown sludge okay and I noticed a few small duck feathers even made it thru. Pond pumps and most submersible pumps will clog. \nhttps://www.harborfreight.com/20v120v-lithium-ion-dual-power-cordless-transfer-pump-tool-only-56733.html\n\nOf course you'll need a charger and a battery too which can be $80 or so.it also runs on an included 120 VAC adapter if you have power nearby. \n\nPretty sure this duck water trickling down to the little pecan tree roots will be good stuff.",

Probably means I should be expecting another (hopefully twins again) birthing soon. \n\nQuestion though. She is showing obvious favoritism to the buckling, is that a problem?",

That's personal preference but friendly does make for easy milking and easy selling.\n\nWatch the kids and make sure they both eat and pull before a problem arises.",

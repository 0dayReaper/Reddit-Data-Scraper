            "comment": "It would work to some extent... you'd be able to measure power being generated, but it likely would be the wrong voltage and a very small amperage because those motors were wound for 110VAC.\n\nIf you want to run some LEDs with electricity generated by a water wheel, try locating a surplus DC permanent magnet motor or even an automotive 12V alternator to your wheel.  \n\nJust remember that the amount of power you get will depend on how fast the alternator or motor spins... if you don't have a lot of flow, you won't generate much power.   You ideally want the alternator to spin at about 1000 rpm, so set up belts or gearing or water flow to achieve that.\n\nIf you don't have the water flow, maybe a solar panel and battery or windmill would work?",

    "postText": "Has anyone installed their own pump, and pitless adapter onto their well? My 50 gpm well is going into service for our little farm, after 2 years! So this is an exciting time. I'd love to hear about any tips you might have on this. My frost like is 52\", and I am going to plumb a line 6' deep into a greenhouse first, which will fill an Intex swimming pool, from which various other tanks and pumps will feed my drip irrigation system. I have 2000 trees and a few hundred crops like hazelnuts and hops.",

            "comment": "How deep are you placing the pump? What kind of pipe are you planning to use?\n\nI've placed my own pump in two different wells, one at 175 feet and one at 100 feet. Both used one piece of poly pipe, one section of electrical line in the well. The second one I ran a continuous run of wire from the pump controller to the pump. On both  I used water resistant line rated at 250lb working load to support the pump ... it's important there be no tension on the pipe or the wire. Take your time when you make all of your plumbing and electrical connections. I used liquid tape over the splices to be confident they won't leak.\n\nThe hardest part is placing the equipment in the well. When you get the pump, wire and pipe in it's HEAVY. The second one I used an overhead frame with  sheaves to manage the weight and I had a couple of helpers. I tied the safety line off to an eye bolt mounted through the well casing at the top.\n\nThe pitless adaptor was surprisingly easy to install once I got a 2inch hole drilled through the well casing. I used a 1/2 inch corded drill and burned up a couple of Diablo hole saws. \n\nExpect that you will forget some part and have to fo get it. It will take twice as long as you expect.",

                    "comment": "I'm not sure how deep I want to go right now, since I bought a 2 wire 1/2 HP pump. I think it is just 110 v. My static water line is 20' but I will go down to at least 100'. My pump is a MA0343X-4 Deep Well Submersible Pump, 1/2 hp, 110V, 60 Hz, 25 GPM, 150' Head, Stainless Steel, 4\". It will run continuously to fill up a 14' diameter swimming pool inside a greenhouse. In that pool I may or may not raise trout. I want to have the fish poo act as fertilizer in my drip lines. \n\nI am doing a 1\" poly line, up to my fittings and pitless adapter, then exiting 6' down, and to a greenhouse, where all lines will then run above ground for ease of maintenance. I will have 3 tanks after the swimming pool, 1 for deciduous trees, 1 for evergreens, and 1 for my greenhouse. I may add another tank for my own landscaping, if I ever get to my own stuff...\n\nMy set up from pump upwards is like this: pump &gt; reducing bushing &gt; male threaded with extra long barbed adapter &gt; 4' of 1\" poly &gt; backflow preventer &gt; 100'+ of poly &gt; barbed adapter fitting &gt; pitless adapter &gt; out of well to yard hydrant &gt; float switch in the pool.\n\nI'm trying to make some lists now, so that I don't forget anything! It is pretty long, but almost complete I think. I am watching Youtube tutorials, and just taking the best of's from those, and gathering tips and tricks from those.\n\nAs for the lowering of the pump, plus everything else: I have a mini-ex, which I will hang a pulley from, and will lower the whole deal down on a steel cable, tied to the top of the pump casing.\n\nWhat power cable should I use for a 110v, 1/2 hp, 2-wire pump?",

According to  https://www.aquascience.net/wire-sizing/ you can have a maximum run of 178 feet of 12 gage 2 wire to a 115v 1/2hp pump, remember thats from the breaker to the pump. Use cable rated for this use. I used 12 gage for my 3/4hp 220v pump.",

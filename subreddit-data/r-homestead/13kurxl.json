            "comment": "Greatest simplest way to go, I buy flour in 50 lb bags divvy it up into manageable vacuum packed bags of 8lbs or so.. and it is clean, rodent free, and easy to work with.. $18.49/50 lbs of flour.. vs 5lbs at supermarket for 4.79/bag... Grape harvest comes in I use the vacuum bags to save / freeze juice for the winter. Flattened bags of juice thaw quickly and are easily consumed direct from freezer.. Same with Banana cr\u00e8me pie, use Martha Stewards recipe \\*4 freeze custard for future pie making.. I like them because when the food is flattened out in the bag it freezes faster than a container (center taking a longer time..)",

My parents have always hunted and butchered their own moose, and every year we'd wrap the hamburger and steaks in three layers of plastic wrap. It kept it from getting freezer burnt just as well and I've never felt the need to purchase a vacuum sealer myself.",

Mason jars don't stack well in the freezer. I don't know if you could vacuum seal something like green beans or blueberries in a Mason jar or if the quality would be the same.",

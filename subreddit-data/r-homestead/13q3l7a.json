So if south was the bottom of the page, this layout would be perfect.  Literally--it would be perfect.  The tall crops (sunflowers and corn) are at the far north (again, if south was bottom), so they don't block the light from the shorter crops.\n    \nYou've already planted for this year, so you can't fix this.  Next year, rotate this puppy 90 degrees, and I'll basically guarantee you that your yields will get a lot better.",

However I am sure you will learn a lot about how you want things next year.  \n\nPersonally, I've always had more success with patches than rows. \n\nI find rows leave some of your crop exposed to the elements and may only protect the stuff in the middle. \n\nEvery year my garden gets better and better and I know yours will too. Good luck! \n\nPs... definitely cut your corn and sunflower rows in half and double them tho. They will grow fine 4 rows on the left and 4 on the right",

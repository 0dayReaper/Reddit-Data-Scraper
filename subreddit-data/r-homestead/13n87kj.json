The oldest coppiced trunk is as  big as my leg, almost ready to harvest again!\n\nBlack Locust is easy to split, grows in straight poles, burns great, just the most ideal firewood ever.",

                    "comment": " I cut two 75+-year old Black Locusts about 12-13 years ago. They were 60+ feet tall and close to 36\" diameter. The stumps did not sprout at all, but instead the whole yard sprouted the next year from the roots, to a very wide radius, into a thicket that was too dense to walk through. It was amazing. I think a lot of people have had these same experiences, but I don't find much in the way of literature about it so I felt like I should document the process into micro-detail. Mark Krawczyk's book Coppice Agroforestry (wonderful book) and these forums are the best sources of any kind of explanation about what to expect, and considering we all talk about Black Locust as being the miracle tree that it is, I'd like to be able to point to something concrete and visual as to what these trees can do. I know the science says most people prefer a story to a spreadsheet, but for me, data is king.",

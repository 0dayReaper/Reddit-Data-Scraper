    "postText": "I have to brag on this company. I recently bought this pull behind spreader and the cable in the control box bent as soon as I started using it. I had to manually open and close the feeder door. I called them today because they say they have a 3 year warranty. This was literally the best customer service interaction I\u2019ve had in years. The rep was helpful and got me a replacement part ordered and shipped the same day. They definitely exceeded my expectations. I didn\u2019t have the receipt but they didn\u2019t ask for it either. Just wanted to let everyone know they stand behind their products if you\u2019re looking at purchasing something.",

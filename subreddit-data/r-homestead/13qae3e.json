    "postText": "This is the story of \u201cChicken\u201d our chicken. She was the runt of our first flock and has always been at the bottom of the pecking order. She is the friendliest chicken you could ever hope to meet and is always the first to come running. \n\nTwo and a half years ago, as winter set in and the wild animals began to get hungry, Chicken was attacked by an opossum. Beauty, the head hen, fought off the possum long enough for me to get there and take care of it. But sadly, Chicken was mortally wounded. She had a 9 inch tear from her ear to her opposite wing and everything was hanging out. It didn\u2019t look good for poor Chicken. \n\nBut we believed in her and she believed in us. We cleaned her wound out with vetericyn and she sat very calmly for several hours while I stitched her back together with the only thing I had available, dental floss. After a few rounds of antibiotics, lots of warm scrambled eggs, and a couple weeks, I took out the stitches and reintroduced her to the flock where she has been thriving ever since. \n\nThis spring we decided to add more chickens to our flock, so we started looking for fertilized eggs or day old chicks for sale and waited for one of our hens to go broody. And it just so happened to be Chicken. Last week, for the first time in her life, she got all angry and puffy and started sitting on a nest. We gave her some time to get ready and found some day old chicks. So tonight, after a quick switcharoo, she became a mama and took her babies under her wings like a pro. \n\nI\u2019m so proud of our little mama \u201cChicken\u201d",

Highly recommend all poultry lovers pick up a copy of \"Backyard Poultry Medicine and Surgery: A Guide for Veterinary Practitioners\", most vets aren't trained so it's ideal to learn ourselves. Love the dental floss, my go to has always been super glue primarily the gorilla glue brand. Cut all feathers, fur etc around the wound, disinfect with a topical and then slowly glue it shut. As the skin sheds and the wound heals the glue just sloughs off.",

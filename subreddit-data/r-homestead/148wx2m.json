Does anyone have any advice in regards to finding like minded people who would go in on it together? Or maybe a homestead whiling to take in someone whiling to work and learn.",

Most people don\u2019t see the hard work that goes into running a hobby farm and are shocked when they finally experience just how hard it is. Get this experience first.",

Id recommend finding teachers that you can learn from eg Richard Perkins, the Krameterhof farm in Austria, Curtis Stone, and many others. \n\nWhat are your goals? Self sufficiency? Farm tourism? Flower production, tree nursery, etc? \n\nBe a bit more specific and get back to me and i might have better advice for you.",

    "postText": "Hi! So I recently adopted a 11week old Australian Shepherd in hopes that she can help protect my 18 chickens on my 1/2 acre of land. I didn\u2019t realize when getting her that she\u2019s not an official LGD, but a herding dog..is there anyway I can still train her to protect my hens? \nShe was raised on a farm and is so gentle with all my hens. But so far not very alert. Since she is still a puppy does anyone have any advice on how I can slowly start training her to be more alert for predators and more specifically foxes?\n\nAny advice or resources would be so helpful to me! Thank you so much in advance \ud83d\ude0a",

Defending isn\u2019t their go to, not a single one by herself. \n\nGuinea fowl would do a better job to be honest. They\u2019re a small turkey and live in groups, and will live with hens fine (no roosters, they have to be separated). They kill and eat mice and rats and will kill snakes. Also they eat ticks, spiders, lizards, worms, and a whole host of other crawlers and insects. \n\nDownside, when they are alerted of something that isn\u2019t supposed to be there, they are loud. I mean loud. So a residential area could start to have some annoyed neighbors.",

That said, she\u2019s learned to alert me whenever my cats get into a fight or really when anything else out of the ordinary happens. She won\u2019t charge into action though as she expects me to do that and congratulate her for her alerts. I would probably expect the same from yours. She may learn to keep an eye on the hens and let you know if anything happens but I doubt she\u2019ll defend them herself. Also keep in mind these dogs are like shadows. Expect her to follow you everywhere unless you can somehow train her to hang without you. Anyway, congrats on your beautiful pup!",

And Aussies are 100% people pleasers \u2014 they want to do whatever makes their person happy. They\u2019ll mirror your behavior, too, so if you\u2019re alert, they\u2019ll be alert. \n\nThey\u2019re not a guard breed but they can be *intensely* protective of anyone/anything they consider part of their pack. My Aussie is the sweetest, most tender dog on god\u2019s green earth, but if someone he doesn\u2019t know comes to the door he makes sure they\u2019re aware of him.\n\n\u201cGuard\u201d behavior, like any behavior, takes time. As she matures she\u2019ll learn what her territory is, who\u2019s in, and who\u2019s out.",

One thing in particular I\u2019d like in a book related to this is how much I can expect to harvest from planting a certain amount. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s common in these kinds of books or not, because I haven\u2019t looked into this in as much detail before. Any book/other resource recommendations would be appreciated.",

Info about the seed itself(number of seeds per ounce, germination rate, amount of seed required per 100 sq/ft, and expected germination time), planting info (flats vs. direct sow and spacing for either method), if you plant in flats first; info on number of plants in 1st flat, how many flats to plant per 100 sq/ft, same info for second flat, when to plant out, weeks to harvest, yield per 100 sq/ft, pounds consumed per year per person in the US, per pound content of calories/protein/calcium.  This info and additional notes are proved in 50 pages of charts for veggies, grains, oil crops, compost/cover crops, fodder crops, energy/fiber/paper crops, tree and cane crops, and a basic section on flowers.",

It\u2019s a book on food forestry and permaculture that provides seasonal yield while remaining self-supporting. It also helps you catch and conserve water in your landscape, build healthy soil, and focuses on biodiversity so you can have pollinators in your area helping you along. We picked this book up about a year ago and it\u2019s been a wealth of knowledge.",

            "comment": "The Intelligent Gardener and Gardening When It Counts by Steve Solomon for techniques to improve soil and plant health, and get crops in when times are tough and inputs are unavailable.\n\nThe Market Gardener by J.M. Fortier for rotations, timings and yield planning.\n\nEdit: Not really about corn or grains, but I don't consider those to be optimal for home grown sustenance. The time/effort ratio for harvesting, processing and storing is terrible without significant equipment investments. By the time you are done hand threshing, winnowing and grinding enough flour for a loaf of bread you could have dug, cooked and eaten as many calories of potatoes/sweet potatoes and been back to work improving your land/garden/life for hours. It does make sense for some people though, and I don't know your situation well enough to tell you what to do, just something to consider.\n\nOh, and Trees of Power by Akiva Silver. Because anyone thinking about self sufficient farming should be considering the roles tree crops can play in their plans. Nuts in particular can be a major source of easy to grow food that gardeners too often overlook.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m currently looking for property and one option is a 28 acre raceway (dirt bike/atv type track).  Looks like it\u2019s been shutdown for a few years so it\u2019s a little overgrown.  I think it would be possible to turn it into pasture (for cows or sheep) by bulldozing the jumps, then doing a single tillage to remove compaction and then seeding.  It wouldn\u2019t be great, but over time with some animals I think it would return the land to a more natural state.  I assume a lot of gravel fill was brought in as the base for the track.\n\nThe big question is would it be dangerous from a contamination standpoint?  I assume with the vehicles that there has been at least some oil/gas/fluids leaking, rubber from tires, etc.  obviously soil testing would be an option, but before getting that far along, do you think there is good potential in this kind of land?",

            "comment": "I don't know what your particular track looks like, but I would be tempted to work with what you have and turn the varied terrain into a benefit. All that variation makes different microclimates that can be really cool, interesting, and productive if you plan it out right. Pockets of trees, ponds with dry creeks depending on the flow of water with fruit trees planted next to it (like trees on swales), pastured sections, berry thickets, etc. A flat pasture is not necessarily more natural than a varied terrain.",

I\u2019m not sure if the new owners did any soil testing or if they even cared (new owners are Mennonite), but if you\u2019re concerned, it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.",

I would get it decently level then run pigs on it. I would also ask if they added any other soil/sand types to the mix over the years.",

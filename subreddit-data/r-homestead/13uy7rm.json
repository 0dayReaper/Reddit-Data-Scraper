    "postText": "Good day mates \n\nLooking for some wisdom in regards to cattle feed, I'm looking to get two weaned steer calves to raise for harvest for family not selling.\n\nLooking to harvest between 16 to 20 months don't want to feed through two winters\n\nHe will also have access to pasture and hay.\n\nAll that being said when looking at tractor supply or other stores like that the prices between cattle feed I see very from $12 a bag to $28 a bag for 50 pounds. \n\nBig price jumps. I don't fully understand all the percentages when it says 12% or 20%. Or what exactly is important for what I am looking to do. \n\nAnyone have input or some knowledge of different cattle feed. \n\nThanks",

            "comment": "A farm store like Tractor Supply is the most expensive place to buy cattle feed. Finds feed store and buy in larger quantities to save lots of money.  The 12-20% is the protein content of the feed. Higher protein helps put on muscle faster.  \nIf you have sufficient pasture available, you don\u2019t have to add any supplemental feed. Just give them a mineral block to make sure they have all the right micronutrients.  If they only eat pasture and hay, it will take longer to put in the weight and will be a little leaner meat. There are people that swear by corn fed beef and others prefer the straight grass fed. The older the steer, the stronger the beef flavor will be.",

            "comment": "The commenter who said feed store is right. To that, I\u2019ll add:\n  \nInstead of buying bagged, pre-mixed feed, you might just want to research the feed blend you want to feed, and then make it yourself. Hay (straight or ground), kernel corn, and silage corn (chopped) are common feed ingredients for fattening steers.  So if you can figure out what blend you want to feed, you can buy the individual ingredients, in bulk, from the feed store, and then mix them yourself. You\u2019ll save even more that way. \n   \nThe one thing I\u2019ll say is, if you want to slaughter at 18 months or earlier, you need to put big weight on these steers. 18 months is the industry benchmark for feedlot-fattened and corn-finished steers. So if you want to hit that timeline, you\u2019ll need to either put some rocket fuel in those steers, or be ready for low-weight carcasses.",

Chasing squirrels, hunting squirrels, killing squirrels, throwing squirrels around like a ragdoll. 1-2 JRTs on patrol during the day will signal to the squirrel army that a new special operator strike force has arrived. The squirrels will discuss retreat options, and they will stick much closer to the trees. And as a bonus, you will have two very happy dogs.\n\nSource: my JRT loved two things. Me and chasing squirrels.",

I don't know it's kind of a flippable coin with dogs, you can get them and they can have good instincts and other times you have to have them trained to protect your property. \n\nsometimes too friendly and loud but not guarding enough. I would suggest more research on owning dogs and if you need to train them or not.",

It is a solar powered box on a stake that you can put near your garden. It has kept the deer, rabbits, squirrels, moles, and other pests from eating our blackberry bushes, peach and apple trees, and other vegetable vegitation.. Can't remember the name of the product but that is what it is.. a box that sends out a high frequency and it is very annoying (my parents can't hear it, though. I CAN) it does have a on/off switch so you can turn it off when working in the garden.\n\n4. Pellet gun. \n\n5. Sacrifice one of the childrens to the squirrel gods. \n\n6. Dog. Any kind of terrier is the perfect rodent killing machine. \n\n7. Someone mentioned cutting down the tree. That is a beautiful, old mother tree. Yeah don't do that.",

The only downside is it is break open to reload so not super quick. We had squirrels really bad and I took 30-40 the first month I started using it. Their population seems more in check now. I get one or two evey so often instead of 3-5 per day. Just have to set aside some time to sit out and pop them. Just be aware of what's behind them when shooting as it's 1300 fps. It can definitely hurt someone. \n\n\n\nhttps://www.academy.com/p/gamo-wildcat-whisper-177-caliber-air-gun",

We wouldn\u2019t have tree recovery in burned areas without squirrels.\n\nThat said - yeah they can fuck up a garden. \n\nOptions: planting sacrifices along the border.\nFeeding them with peanuts and other goods near but away from your garden (they ignore your plants for easy stuff). \n\nI find if you give them peanuts and make friends they leave your shit alone. They don\u2019t want to fuck with food providers. \n\nThey live to replant the forests and I get my garden to myself. \n\nI honestly find that working with nature instead of trying to bend it to my will works best. Give them a food sacrifice. Plant something they love somewhere else (near a tree).\n\nEdit: to add, peanuts and sunflower seeds are the fastest attractors. I sprinkle a border of that around the garden to distract all sorts of things that would go for my food. Animals usually go for the easy stuff. Make a squirrel or nature area and leave peanuts and seeds there every day for them. \n\nSquirrels hate the smell of human poop and love orange blossoms. They also hate garlic, black pepper, mint, and the urine of predators (which you can buy). Speak their language (scent). \n\nhttps://thebiggreenk.com/blog/homeowner-tips-how-to-keep-squirrels-away/#:~:text=Scents%20like%20white%20pepper%2C%20black,peppermint%20oil%20to%20deter%20squirrels.",

Basically my homie lives to put squirrels and coons in their place. He\u2019s also half lab so he likes to keep the birds in line too. I saw him jump up at a squirrel that was running on our privacy fence and he snagged its foot and took the whole leg clean off. Not gonna lie I felt bad for the squirrel a little bit however I really have yet to see any squirrels come anywhere near the area he patrols since. He\u2019s my best friend and I love to watch him work. Sometimes he digs up moles and groundhogs too. But that\u2019s a little more rare. I like to plant fruit trees in the holes he digs. It seems as soon as he started peeing and digging at the mole tunnels they disappeared so I really just can\u2019t complain about my boy. Dogs truly are man\u2019s best friend.",

Wrap the bottom 4 feet of each tree/hydro pole with a smooth surface like sheet metal or polycarbonate.\n2. Live catch traps -check local laws first to see how.far you can move them.\n3. Check laws first, then make squirrel poles using conibear 110's this should catch as many squirrels as you have traps each day.  In a month you will be caught up, but remember super important to check laws first.  You may have to take a trapping course which is not too expensive and will ensure the animals don't suffer\n4. The A18 is supposed to be just as good.as the conibear 110s but is expensive.\n5. An air rifle/ gun.  Shoots under 500 fps and does not require a license. Although this is an option I do not recommend this.\n6. Going back to option 3, you will note that the book the joy of cooking has a recipe for squirrel pie.  This is one way of getting your food back.\n7.  Attach a hawk platform to one of the hydro poles back their.\n8. Two terriers.\n9. Be nice to any foxes you see, they hunt squirrel and rabbits.\n10. Get your neighbors to put smooth surfaces on their trees/hydro poles as well.  This makes hunting for foxes and dogs easier.\n11.  Talk to your neighbors about their veggie gardens and see what they are doing about it.  Make sure they're not feeding them with peanuts etc. Also if your neighbors have live traps ask to borrow them. If they are feeding the squirrels ask them to stop, but don't ask them to do any of the other stuff because that is just a waste of both your time and their time.\n12 . Tell anyone that recommends cayenne pepper, thank you, and have a nice day.\n13. A combination of 1, 2, 3, 8, 11 would clean up the issue very quickly. So much so that you may not even be able to try option 6.\n\nHappy checking your local laws (getting a trapping license if needed) and hunting :)\nLicense should be relatively cheap and might take about 40 hours of learning (4 or 5 Saturdays), but then will help you deal with other pests humanely if necessary.",

Providing a place for them to dig that isn't your garden will be challenging here too.\n\nTrapping and removing is an option but that tree will be very popular so making it undesirable with a fake owl or hawk may help. I installed one near an area squirrels travelled and seems to have helped.\n\nI have had luck with sprays on plants if they are eating crops. Coyote urine from the local hardware store and some times cayenne pepper. I do put down a mesh ground cover in beds I don't want them to disturb in spring and fall",

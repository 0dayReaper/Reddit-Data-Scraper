With good airflow and not too humid. \n\nNow, you can just put them in the fridge and that will stop them from getting moldy really well, but in the fridge they will go through a process called 'cold sweetening' and dry out. So they will get soft and wrinkly and taste extra sweet, almost not like a potato. \n\nThing about store potatoes is they are likely already months old from the growers storage. Try getting some new potatoes from a farmers market around Fall and I bet you could keep them nice for months.",

We would put them in the main walk in to cool them down more quickly then put them in a smaller cooler we only used for this purpose and cure them for a few weeks at about 55f with a fan on them. Checking for rotten ones a few times but ones that rotted usually had been damaged. For the sweet potatoes the damage didn\u2019t matter as much but we kept those at 85f for a few weeks to cure them.

If you want to try to get them that long without using hormones you have to 1. Harvest before the vines die naturally (but have yellowed), 1. Take care not to damage them in any way (assuming they are already disease free), 2. Cure them properly after harvest for about 2 weeks, then move the temperature down over a period of days to about 47 F (ensuring 95% or higher humidity starting at the curing phase and through storage duration), 3. Total darkness and maintain those conditions with plenty of fresh air.  If you are not worried about how dark they fry when cooked, as it effects the flavor by the Maillard reaction, you can push the temps down closer to 40 F.  All that being said even with the right long dormancy variety, without any sprout inhibitor being used you will be lucky to get 9 months even doing everything perfectly.\n\nSounds like you need an indoor grow setup.  Or you could freeze mashed potatoes.",

I think the potatoes were then taken out of the bags and put in a pile. Different vegetables had their own place down there.\n\nThe root cellar itself was deep down underground below another building and the inside was paved with bricks.",

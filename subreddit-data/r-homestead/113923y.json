I spent 3 weeks near the Arctic circle line during March. I would go out every. Single. Day. At 1-2 times throughout the evening to check. Even if the forecast was bad. \n\nMeanwhile, a friend visiting who has never seen them, checked the forecast and it was low so she didn\u2019t even bother. What do ya know, our 3rd day in, low forecast, but I get a glimpse of theming for 30 seconds. I tell everyone with us to come outside. They do.

Cavendish is the basis for Avonlea, and Green Gables house has been preserved really well. Several years ago there was a fire. There are paths that are marked, although it's been quite a few years since I was there last. The staff on site are well versed in everything Anne. Also, there's another house that you can visit that has connections to LM Montgomery, possibly her grandparents' house...? I remember there was a trunk there that was mentioned in The Story Girl. \n\nHave you ever watched the movies? I loved the ones done in the 80s, I think every girl had a crush on Jonathan Crombie (Gilbert)! The newer ones were well done but very different from the 80s ones.",

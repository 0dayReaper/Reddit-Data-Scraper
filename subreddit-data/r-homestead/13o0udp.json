    "postText": "Looking to start growing some blueberries. I picked up a highbush and a brightwell variety from a local nursery. Through my research I was able to conclude that the hughbush is a self pollinator but the brightwell requires another blueberry bush to produce. \nWill the highbush be sufficient enough to pollinate or should I look for a different variety of blueberry in addition? \nThanks for any help!",

            "comment": "The Brightwell is a rabbiteye blueberry which is a different species than highbush blueberry.  I don't know what they might do in nature but if they read the same literature I do, they will not cross pollinate.  In the vast majority of the south, the highbush is going to die and leave you with the Brightwell.  If you are above 3000 feet, the highbush will live and the Brightwell will likely die.  Tifblue is considered an old rabbiteye variety but it will set a crop without cross pollination.",

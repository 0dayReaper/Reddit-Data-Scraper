I have no political affiliation - all scum and liars. Distrust modern medicine and big pharma. Proponent for bitcoin and taking power out of the banks. Love nature and wildlife. \n\nAfter a road trip through Oregon to visit about 10 different properties my wife and i realized we didn't see any obvious middle ground between bustling cities and trailer parks. Small towns with a few thousand people but nothing more than a grocery, couple poor quality cafes and fast food. We can have a great time with people from either side but i can't imagine being long term friends with them.  \n\nAre we alone here? I'm curious how homesteaders like yourselves have found a private and affordable land near (less than 1hr)  or within a community that is comfortable and enjoyable to be apart of.  \n\nDid you make the changes you wanted to see or did you compromise or did you just fit in perfectly?\n\nThank!\n\nTLDR: did you fit in with the local community after moving to your homestead? What did you compromise if anything and what other actions did you take to find people with whom you were compatible?",

Admittedly we are kind of picky for geographical features which certainly limits our possibilities. The size of town isn't necessarily an issue. More like what is important there. For example in Brookings we found an incredible property but it was adjacent to an active rock quarry which still has 30 years to go and the whole town is filled with fast-food and unhealthy people. We wrongly assumed we'd see more organic and local food in places like this with so much cheap and fertile land. Also thought we'd see arts and crafts and other handmade goods.",

Probably it comes down to the county regulations more than anything.

            "comment": "I think the city you are in (or outside of) makes a BIG difference, and its possible you may have to relocate. If you hate big pharma and see what they are doing, and you're on the west coast, you may need to move. We're outside of Asheville, NC, and have a huge community of people that came together during covid, when all of the internet vaccine wars were going on. Yes, not being pro-pharma did cut our community down to a fraction of what it was before covid, but we still have a thriving and active community of like minded folks that are very aware of the same things we are aware of. And honestly, we are all closer than weve ever been. I have been noticing more people being red pilled and waking up from the other side, so forgiveness and face to face authenticity and relating (outside of internet facades and gatekeeping) is the practice of our time, it seems.\n\nFor me, I may have an advantage over you, because I grew up in the country (west virginia), so I inherently appreciate and understand country people. That helps me a lot being in the country, not only because I know their hearts, but also because I have country running thru my core, and can easily slip into their dialect even, slightly not overtly, without thinking. That being said, I have spent my life way differently. As a child growing up in the country, I used to judge that country people would spend their entire life on one street, and never go see the world, living on the street named after their grandad. Now I see the beauty in them having their family nearby, and owning their generational land, tho I still am grateful I've seen the world. And yes I know all of America is stolen from another people's ancestors. Not trying to have that convo rn,  just pointing out that familial generational living is more beautiful to me than it used to be. I can speak and laugh with the country folks, and understand their way of living. I also must say, that my anti pharma ways have brought me into greater understanding of the most country of folks, as a whole. I am not overtly political either, but have defintely voted left my whole life, and for the first time am understanding the right more than I ever have. While i still disagree on some things, i am waking up to the fact that i am a quite conservative person, which is something i never wouldve guessed, as ive always reveled in my open mindedness. \n\nThe community that I mostly have around me are a blend of homesteaders and artists. Not the country variety of homesteaders, but the type of folks who used to live and make art in the river district, and moved to the country when the arts district was gentrified. Hippies and burning man folks, potters and wood workers, artisans and creators, old fish heads, muscians, retired and active midwives, herbalists and natural doctors, people who were activists in their past, the people who cultivate and dispense plant medicine in ceremony as their purpose. I'm between millenial and gen xer, age-wise, and most of my friends are in this type of category. Fringe artists. Hippies turned homesteaders. When I moved back to the country when my kids were small, I too was worried about finding like minded community. How I built my community around me was simple: find one person who lives in the area that is like me, and connect. I started a fb group for the area, and everyone who knew someone like minded, added/invited their friend. We began having monthly potlucks, which we would have at one person's house one month, another person's the next month. Word of mouth, and people inviting others they knew, grew this fun monthly event, and it became a place to meet others, network, and form more close and lasting friendships. We did this for years. \n\nDuring covid, one thing that became very clear to me, is who my actual living community was. Without fossil fuels and travel, our natural community is those who live directly around us. This can not be understated. Where you live and who is nearby is very important. At the same time, if you are living in the country, you may at some point realize that you have more in common with other people who live in the country than you may have initially realized. Cuz really, homesteading is a choice, a very intentional one. Country living is a choice. The people who choose to live in the country are often doing so for more similar reasons than they might initially realize, even if it's not obvious upon first meeting. This may be what one commenter meant on judgement. If I judged people a certain way in the past, I can honestly say, years of living and watching people react to the \"trending\" political wars over the years has truly helped me clarify who I am and what I am looking for in a community. The more authentic you can be about who you are, the more quickly you will know who your true community is. I speak clearly and often about where I stand on the pharmaceutical transhumanism front, and while I don't wear it on my sleeve or throw it at people (ever), when I am spending a while speaking one on one to someone, one of us almost always brings it up in some way. In these tense times, the polarization is getting intense, and it helps more than anything to spend time really speaking one on one to people- in person. If most of our conversations and connections happen over the internet, we may mistakenly think we all have less in common than we actually do. Most platforms highlight opposition as a mechanism for keeping people engaged. We often intersect and align way more with any given person than we might think if our only connection was thru the internet.\n\nI hope you have the ability to speak your mind to others. That in my opinion is the most important thing we can do right now. Discussions are important for many reasons. Both because sane, logical, perspective accepting, non-judgemental discussion will save the world and keep us from fighting (realizing we are actually not on the opposing sides we thot we were), and because speaking up about what you believe will make you a lighthouse for others who believe the same, whether they have the guts to speak up or not. They will still hear you and seek you out. Speaking up with love and grace is a big part of growing your community, and deepening with those who live around you that are like minded. And also the way you realize you are more like minded with those who you might not initially have assumed you are in alignment with at first glance.\n\nEdit: fixed two words that sounded weird.",

Looking for an artsy, free spirited town, and then searching the country side nearby is crucial, I think. I wouldn't want to be outside of a town that made me vomit in my mouth a little. Having a fun place to drive to is crucial, as well as a good example of the kind of people you'll find around  that town, on the outskirts. There are some states and areas I know I would've suffered isolation in a lot more during covid than we do here. But yes, generally, awesome alternatively minded people can be found anywhere. But in some areas they gather more densely, for sure. Good luck! And YES, look in NC, more specifically, the mtns of western NC. there are lots of places 30-90 minutes out that are still affordable, but the prices are going up quick. We are one of the few areas that are still on the map in the \"rising ocean\" simulated maps, and people have known that since the 70s. We are in one of the most biologically diverse, and oldest mountain ranges in the US (Appalachian mtns), and the country people around this mtn range, in my opinion, are my favorite brand. From WV to NC, I've spent most of my life in this range, so I'm defintely biased. But also, not alone in this bias. It's kind of like heaven. We get regular rain (no serious fires and gardening is easy), we have 4 solid seasons, none being too extreme, and we have apples cherries and peaches. Not to mention i get to take the blue ridge parkway across town if i want. And if you're into alternative medicine, it's literally growing all over my property. Our medicine cabinet is located on our 7 acres, and is there for the picking.",

Join the local fire department, and then you'll also be first on scene if you ever need to fight fire at your home as well. \n\nAmateur radio folks are often likeminded, as are search&amp;rescue volunteers. \n\nI especially like volunteering in emergency response because I get to learn from other peoples' mistakes, and meet the neighbors in the rare moments when they actually want people they don't already know to visit their homes. \n\nThere's a lot of nice homestead space within an hour of university towns in the northwest, and those tend to attract potential friends of the non-redneck variety. \n\nIf you were road tripping, you probably weren't driving on gravel, nor seeing all the good spots only accessible via really shitty roads. Northwest roads have a fractal nature: Interstates, then state highways, then windy little paved things, then maybe some interstitial janky fomerly-gravel chipseal, then scribbles of horribly potholed gravel off of those. Sometimes tiny capillaries of bare dirt off the gravel, but those are impassable to most vehicles for most of most years. The good places to get away from it all are up those gravel roads -- being close to a road-trip-worthy artery makes a site noisy and annoying for homesteading compared to the other options, not to mention more expensive. \n\nFWIW, trailer parks are still pretty much urban. Truly rural folks aren't all that fond of being able to see and hear their neighbors.",

            "comment": "We're an hour outside of Albuquerque (east).  The topography of the area makes a very clear delineation between town and \"not\".  Everything between us and town is rural.  About a 1 hour drive.  As soon as you come out the other side of the mountains, you're in the city.  Very abrupt.  Pretty much everything on our side of the mountain sits on an acre, at least.  Most houses have goats or cows or horses or chickens running around.  We're an hour away because that's where the land was cheap.  But the closer you get to town, similar land... you're just paying to be closer to town.  So in my mind, everyone between us and town is basically doing the same thing we are.  I mean some are autobody shops and some sell sheds or whatever.  But most are just a simple home with some small livestock on the property.\n\nBut what I find funny is your whole assumption that where someone lives somehow dictates their preferred lifestyle or their mentality toward the lifestyle.  Something about Santa Fe makes people chatty.  And we visit there a lot.  I cannot count how many times a casual chat with a shop clerk or someone who wanted to pet our dogs or whatever turns into a whole lengthy conversation about our lives once they find out we're self building a homestead.  We've lost hours to endless questions.  People are fascinated.  Some are saving up.  Others only dreaming.  But so many people are interested and curious.\n\nGranted, we're in a town of 200.  There's one business.  we have to pick up our own mail and dump our own trash.  But everyone in the town is doing pretty much the same thing.  But I will admit if you're looking for a place that's NOT the city but still has \"more than a grocery, couple poor quality cafes and fast food.\"  You're probably going to want to start researching \"suburban homesteading\" as I don't know a lot of places with a bunch of homesteads AND multiple grocery stores, fine dining, etc.  The more land people have, the sparser the population.  Businesses don't want to set up shop where there aren't enough customers.",

Also i realize this lack of small business could be a great potential market for bringing in a little income fot the homestead. \n\nOur experience on the road trip was similar, people we meet were often very nice and friendly. We really enjoyed a few hours chatting with them but realized quickly that the conversation was always going towards a few key topics - drugs, alcohol, hunting, fishing, fireworks. Unlike your experience, although friendly and nice, they wouldnt often follow up on anything we talked about while we could learn about the history of their whole family. \n\nI am genuinely a very open person and get along with most everyone even though we wouldn't be best friends.

They're about 6 hours away but they're another homesteading household we can rely on if we have questions or need help with something.  Most of the other things get sorted out on reddit or youtube or whatever.  But we're also still building.  So we're not there 100% of the time to make friends.  And in a town of 200, if you're not there for the few events that come up, there's really no good \"in\" with people.  So we're kind of waiting for a community event when we're actually in town.\n\nMost other loose acquaintances we've made have been in passing with other customers at the Dispensary.  lol.  Everyone's chatty and having a good time there.  haha",

I also imagined we would be so busy the first few years getting started that we wouldn't be running to town for anything other than necessities so in that case, getting in with a community could wait.",

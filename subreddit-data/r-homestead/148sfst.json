If you just burn the weeds then the carbon and decay will fertilize that little crack and make it even easier for plants to grow back.\n\nAs a side note to anyone who might say that pouring salt in the crack is bad... Do you not use salt on your concrete and asphalt during the winter to deal with ice and snow? Granted that's more akin to saltpeter than it is to table salt but the chemical compositions aren't too far from each other.",

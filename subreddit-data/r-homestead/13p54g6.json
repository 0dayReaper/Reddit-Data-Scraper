            "comment": "Nobody was born knowing this stuff and we are all on a learning curve.  In general do the following and see if it helps.  You want to grow as healthy a plant as possible.  This is because the plant can produce internal protective chemicals if it has enough energy.  Try to improve the organic matter in the soil, get the pH right, make sure there is plenty of nutrients.  All these help give you a healthy foliage that can produce more energy in the plant.  Rotate you crops as much as possible.   Plant at the correct time for optimum growth.  Some insects can be completely controlled by proper timing.  In my area, you don't want to plant southern peas before June 21 to avoid the pea weevil.  Corn shouldn't be planted after June 21 because that allows the third generation earworm to attack the plant in large numbers.  You can tolerate some damage.  If you will post questions about specific insects, there will be specific techniques to avoid them.",

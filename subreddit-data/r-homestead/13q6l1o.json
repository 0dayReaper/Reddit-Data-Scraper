The flies and the smell are awful.  We used to have a small cabin in the mtns and they treated some of the fields close to it in this manner.  Several times we got up there and turned around and came back home.",

They were brought into North America to help with the aphids and now the species has done so well. Living in farming area in Ontario Canada and its a nightmare. The population booms in August. As we were raking up from our apple trees we were swarmed. They land on you and bite. Doesn't leave a mark but it hurts. If you squish them they have a stink juice. Then they spend the fall getting into our house and sleeping away in the attic. \nSpring time is nasty as they flock to the warm windows. I hand vaccuum them up all day. My peak day last month totalled 300 vaccuumed on my office window from 9am to 5pm. Let me count the ways in which I hate them.",

            "comment": "I surveyed a large orchard for work once that I could tell right away was heavily sprayed with pesticides throughout each growing season. The old farmer and his wife lived in a house surrounded by the sprayed trees. At the initial meeting with the farmer and state official (I was surveying it for an agricultural preservation grant) I spoke up to make it clear that I wouldn\u2019t work on the farm unless the spraying had ceased for atleast a week. That I had to be on the safe side due to the fact that having a grandparent with Parkinson\u2019s in combination with major pesticide exposure dramatically increases the risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s. The old farmer had been mute but seemingly kind and full of thought upon meeting him and for the entire meeting. I recognized his silence from my grandfather. He looked dismayed and spoke up to say he had Parkinson\u2019s. Most people don\u2019t know how strong of an association there is between pesticides and neurological disorders. It was heartbreaking to unknowingly help him make the likely connection.",

Depending on the type of herbicide and the level of concentration in your soil, persistent herbicides can last anywhere from a month to three or more years before completely breaking down into inert compounds. - from [https://www.maine.gov](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/pesticides/documents2/messages/Important%20Warning%20Regarding%20Persistent%20Herbicides.pdf) \n\n- You can increase microbial breakdown of herbicides in your soil by tilling (adding oxygen), and adding water water and non-contaminated organic matter to the soil. This combination will allow microorganisms to proliferate in the soil and increase the rate of herbicide breakdown. - from [www.pesticides.Montana.edu](https://www.pesticides.montana.edu/reference/contamination.html#:~:text=You%20can%20increase%20microbial%20breakdown,the%20rate%20of%20herbicide%20breakdown)\n\nI\u2019m not defending the worst offenders, I wouldn\u2019t touch a glyphosate compound. And on a larger scale, black plastic sheets come with their own negative environmental impacts. \n\nFor Johnson grass specifically:\n\n- Grazing and burning are not effective for the control of johnsongrass. Prevent johnsongrass from becoming established in new areas. This can be accomplished by preventing the production of seed, the spread of rhizomes from infested to uninfested areas, and by controlling seedlings originating from shattered seed. - from [www.wric.ucdavis.edu](https://wric.ucdavis.edu/information/natural%20areas/wr_S/Sorghum.pdf)\n\nFinally, I\u2019m looking towards the greater good, our seed production is a compounding, and expanding net positive. I\u2019m not uneducated about the methods for noxious weed control, mechanical and chemical. \n\nEdit: fixed links",

We\u2019re partnered with the Audubon Society &amp; our local watershed alliance in their project to support minority/ women/ veteran farmers. And I\u2019ve got five beehives around the place. Our wildflowers are two acres of the local eco type collected from small remaining sections of original and undisturbed prairie remnants. The program is amazing, we don\u2019t touch pesticides, the Johnson grass is something else. Our Audubon rep/ farm director is very knowledgeable and we\u2019ve been to many farm conventions. I\u2019m happy to report the farm conventions focus on educating that the old ways are outdated, and we know better now. The native grass will be on 5-8 acres, mechanical methods of removal did a good first &amp; second hit to the Johnson grass, we\u2019re battling the persistent stands now. \n\nSo, Poast is the variety of herbicide, it\u2019s active ingredient is Sethoxydim, I looked up that: \n\nMode of Action: Sethoxydim is absorbed rapidly through leaf surfaces, transported in the xylem and phloem, and accumulated in meristematic tissues. Sethoxydim inhibits acetyl CoA carboxylase (much like the herbicide fluazifop-p-butyl), the enzyme responsible for catalyzing an early step in fatty acid synthesis.\n\nAny knowledge on Sethoxydim? I\u2019ll be continuing my research, I also trust there\u2019s a greater good we\u2019re working towards. \n\nOur seeds go for large restoration projects after infrastructure projects are completed by the state, and are available for civilians to purchase through our distributor. And from me at farmers markets\u2026 some of these comments prior to yours actually rose my ire tbh, I\u2019ve been told farming is thankless, but having it be blindly misunderstood was frustrating.\n\nEdit: I was being sensitive, I re-read the comments, they\u2019re well intentioned, I just didn\u2019t see a way to engage with them.

Is the pesticide situation in the US that bad?\n\nAnyway, my biggest concern would be that you can tell in the photo that there is a town somewhere in the background and that the field next to the road is being slowly eaten up by those regular houses.

You should only have a big dust issue when the fields are being tilled/planted/ or harvested, which will likely only be a few days out if the year. People are commenting like the bare fields you see in the photo will remain that way all year long. The Sunshine will be unrelenting in the summer. \nYou\u2019ll see more lightning bugs than ever over the fields at night. Beautiful sunrise and sunsets. In winter you will likely get very large drifts against the home and your property as the winds will just rip across the fields. If you plant some trees as windbreaks in the right spots this could be a neat and viable property imo.

The opportunity to connect with a farming arae and enhance Regenerative Agriculture is a great one if you can find it. I love in Wisconsin and it's hard to keep land from development or corporate ownership but a wonderful organization has been working for a long time and now offers and enhanced farmers network. \n\nI'd encourage you to look into the area. Go to county board meeting or at least read their agendas and can also check with the DNR about status of programs to help plant trees and swales to buffer the farmland.\n\nMarbleseed.org and the Uni. Wisconsin Regenerative Agriculture extension projects give me a lot of hope but there have to people holding land to work things around.\n\nIf you like the house, and are willing to be involved in the community and advocate for Best Practices, I would encourage you to look deeper into this. \n\nYes the practices of the farmer would impede your place however the benefits of planting lots of trees and being able to hold space for the return to rural quality of life and local healthy food systems should weigh in too.\n\nAll depends on your timeframe, resources and willingness",

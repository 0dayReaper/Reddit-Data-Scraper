    "postText": "EDIT: found out there\u2019s a type of nematode that will target them. Ordered a package and will try them out. Seems idea for a compost pile because they need to be kept moist and so does the compost. Fingers crossed. \n\nBeen working on how to compost in the desert for about a year. Finally hit my stride and am actually seeing some dirt appear. However, I just went to turn it today and it\u2019s CRAWLING (literally dozens of them from small to huge in a not very big pile) with cockroaches. I finally got rid of the cockroaches in my home so this is freaking me out. Luckily I set up the compost bin pretty far away but those big ones can TRAVEL. Is there any way to get rid of the cockroaches without fumigating the whole pile thereby killing all my good composting bugs? I understand why they\u2019re there and that in terms of composting, they\u2019re helpful but I have to worry about the property at large and my neighbors buildings too. Compost pile isn\u2019t worth a cockroach factory to me. Also smashed a black widow today and am having a fun time with spiders but they\u2019re typically hanging out on the lid so I just sprayed that with spider killer. The handful in the pile I\u2019ll just have to deal with. Where there\u2019s prey, there will be predators. But yea, cockroaches are NO BUENO.",

Maybe somebody knows of a targeted pesticide that could at least reduce the population, but beyond that, I\u2019d probably just let the compost finish and give it a good long while before starting up again.",

The first time I saw the wood ones where I am, I was planting flowers in a half rotted stump and I screamed bloody murder \ud83d\ude06 I was so paranoid they\u2019d get into my house until I found out what they were. \nHopefully you can just move your compost way away from the house. \nOr maybe you could spread it out in the sun and let birds pick them all out?\nI would imagine as long as you don\u2019t bring compost in your house you should be ok?",

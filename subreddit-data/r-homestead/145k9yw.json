            "comment": "I'd try to find local groups to join and volunteer with. If there aren't exactly \"homestead\" groups, there still might be organic food oriented groups, veg gardening groups, etc. The thing is - you have to be open to making friends of all ages with this approach, and then the homesteading or homesteading/adjacent folks start introducing you as you get to know them to that niece/nephew, that person they know from the mill who has a little homestead, etc etc. \n\nAfter they get to like you, the conversation always goes pretty quickly to, \"why isn't a nice person like you attached?\" or for friends, \"you remind me of Ryan at the coffee place, do you know him? He has 10 acres out around Route 41 and he's got all these things going on like cheese making and he has a huge garden, I think he sells at the farmer's market on Main . . .\"   \nand there's your moment :). I wonder what percentage of couples in the world met via an introduction from mutual acquaintances. \n\nAnd anyway, even if that doesn't help, you've made friends with people who have a bunch of knowledge and experience to help you along the way! You might not meet a spouse from getting involved with the local \"Organic Vegetable Gardens Supply Co-Op and Resource Club\" but some nice old lady there might be the one to tip you off on a perfect first homestead. That old guy who needed a ride home that time from the \"Permaculture and Conservation Meet-Up\" because his car broke down might turn out to be a lifeline of tractor information when you buy the cheap little thing for your first homestead off Craigslist. We all need community and that's a piece of advice I give to my kids, to dive in and get involved deeply with something they're passionate about and make good friends of all ages.",

    "postText": "Back in 2021 my wife and I moved to our dream property and went from a tiny townhouse with no backyard to a good chunk of land!\n\nThis section of the property of almost 4 acres was not used for anything and I've always loved apples, brings back good memories of my grandma, so planting an orchard was something I've always wanted!\n\nThis winter I found Stefan Sobkowiak on YouTube and his permaculture approach. Look him up on YouTube he is fascinating! He uses a trio approach, a nitrogen fixer and 2 fruit trees. Each tree has shrubs and perennials.\n\nWe've planted now 4 trios, 2 apples, 2 pears, 2 cherries and 2 plums. Each tree has 2 shrubs so far of either blueberries, raspberries, blackberries  or haskaps. Perennials to come! Our nitrogen fixers are growing nicely in pots started from seeds, they'll go in the orchard in the fall.\n\nIf you guys want to follow our journey we have a YouTube channel, here is the orchard playlist https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlnBLUneTNClM8SjCo8iJyaFZErIkPqIA\n\nWe are looking at putting almost 200 trees total within the next 2-3 years! Hoping to get a small U-pick orchard open to the public eventually!\n\nWe have some mature apple trees in the backyard and hard and normal cider are on the agenda for this fall :)",

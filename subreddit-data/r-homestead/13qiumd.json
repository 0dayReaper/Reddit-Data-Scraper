    "postText": "So I'm looking at a farm and it's right in the edge of a river that has been contaminated by the sewage from one of the major cities and 2 smaller towns up stream. It's 10km away from where the pollution is really bad but it still smells. \nI am thinking about getting land that boarders the river about 3ha (7.4 acres)\nIn size I just really wanted to find out pros and cons of this property.\nAny advice\nI've been looking into purifying the water with charcoal and airatiton bubblers  that I can use for fruit trees. Also considering a borehole for ground water but could this also be contaminated and not worth it?\n\nWhat health concerns should I be worried about?\n\nThe farm also is only accessible through a small bridge that looks like it floods in the rainy season so that is also something I'm keeping in mind with the property",

There are big signs closer to the town stating what crops shouldn't be grown with that water. But nothing further down the river. \nThey do plan to fix it but it could take years \nThe thing is the area I am is very dry and water is scarce but still thinking if it's worth it.\nIt's a really good deal for the area.",

I'd definitely love to work with them to clean the river even if I don't get this farm it's something I'd still try to work towards.",

What if 10 years from now they approve some factory between you and town or one of the towns loosens laws?\n\nI guess what I'm asking is, \"if that water becomes so polluted you can't use it at all, do you still think the land is a good value?\"  If the answer to that is yes, then the next question would be \"If the water becomes so polluted that you come to know without a doubt that it's contaminating your soil, do you still consider it a good value?\"  Which next becomes, \"Do you think either of those eventualities is possible considering the current direction politics and environmental behavior is going in your country/neighboring towns?\"  And finally, \"If you think there's any chance that's possible, do you still consider it a good investment?  Do you have plans for the land that can survive bad water and bad soil?\"  If you're building an auto repair shop you might care a lot less about those things than if you want to put in an orchard.\n\nI can't answer those for you.  But if it were my money and my future, that's where my thoughts would be going.",

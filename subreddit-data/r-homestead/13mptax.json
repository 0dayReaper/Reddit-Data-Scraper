    "postText": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m looking for some feedback on my plan. I own 38 acres in a remote part of Colorado. The land is raw and has a well head already in place from many years ago. \n\nMy potential plan is to put a shipping container on the land, install tilting solar panels on top so that I have the option to stand them up during winter and prevent too much snow build up. I would use half of the shipping container for storage and the batteries for the solar panels.\n\nAdditionally, I want to install a reverse osmosis system for the well water to have a constant source of really clean potable water. My biggest question is can I install the shipping container right on top of the well head to put the pump and filtration system inside the shipping container? \n\nAny advice on this whole plan is appreciated and welcomed!",

Doing that offers no advantages, and presents possible future issues.\n\nLook up your well permit [here](https://dwr.state.co.us/Tools/WellPermits) and see how deep it is. That will determine what pump you need and ultimately how much solar to run it. They make DC deep well pumps that can run directly off of the solar, without an inverter. For your described set up that would probably be worth looking into.",

What happens if your well need work in the future and they can't get the truck/equipment to it?\n\nAlso, you've probably heard this a lot but since it's Colorado, obligatory- Did you read over the well permit to make sure you can do what you need to with your well?",

And all domestic wells do not allow the same thing. Domestic wells often have limitations, too. For instance my domestic well has a limitation on how large my garden can be and how many acre feet of water I can use per year and I can only  have 1 additional  residence to my primary. \n\nOp, Just make sure you've seen the actual permit is all I am saying.  If the permit doesn't list it, it isn't allowed.",

            "comment": "Test the water before putting in any other reverse osmosis system.  My water is potable without anything other than a filter to remove the iron ore that comes up.  You will also need to consider how deep the well is.  It takes a lot of power to move water and basic solar may not be enough depending on the water needs.  Water is heavy to move.  I know my well, in the mountains of Virginia, is quite deep.  My parents had a shallow well that could handle solar well but dried up every few years during droughts, even though this wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d consider a dry climate b",

            "comment": "Reverse osmosis is overkill. If your well was properly installed (in a good water bearing unit, good surface seal to prevent runoff from entering) there is no reason to spend the money (and electricity if you planned on solar only) on RO. Water quality tests are relatively cheap if you want peace of mind. If it is a taste/hardness preference, you can get cheaper filter systems for that purpose.\n\nAnd standing up your panels in winter will greatly increase the wind load on your panels. So check to see if they are rated for a certain wind speed when vertical and that they are secured well.",

            "comment": "Thank you, everyone! The well was initially permitted for commercial use, but the permit is expired. I will need to submit another application. My thoughts for why to do this were that it gets down to about -10 F in winters and I thought having some light heating in the shipping container would help avoid any frozen pipes.\n\nThat being said, it definitely makes sense to leave room for potential work needed to be done on the well. Any guidance how much room I should leave?",

Our well sees -20\u00b0 every year and we've never had an issue with freezing and all it has is a little plastic cap on it.  \n\nOur well is in the middle of our property about 500 ft from any structures or what have you. I don't know about a minimum though. Not sure how deep the well is, but if it's old and was primarily used for commercial irrigation it is possible it's not terribly deep, which means you could need to drill it out further some day if the aquifer dries up or drops significantly in quality. So, I'd leave enough room for the drill rig to get in comfortably.\n\nWhen you apply for a new well permit push to get everything you are allowed, even if you don't think you'll need it, because you'll be unlikely to get more added to your permit later. So, say you can have a 1 acre garden but you don't plan to garden, get permission for the garden anyway, because if you sell or change your mind getting them to add uses to an established well permit is really hard if not impossible as I understand it.",

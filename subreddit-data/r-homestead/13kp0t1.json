I personally like the beet juice because it's a couple pounds heavier per gallon of fluid, and has a really low freeze point, and as the name implies it won't corrode your rims. \n\nA local tire shop was able to fill mine for me so I didn't even have to go all the way back to my dealership.\n\n\nI also ended up adding a wheel weight kit though, and am still considering something like HeavyHitch product for front end loader work, or at the least a ballast box filled with cement. \n\nYou can also obviously run that mower off the back for lots of country ballast, it's only* likely an issue if you are trying to do bucket work in and around structures.",

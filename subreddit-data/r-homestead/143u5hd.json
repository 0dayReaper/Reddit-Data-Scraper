If so, check you\u2019ve followed the instructions about earth rods correctly.\n\nIf the earth is good, check the wires. If your fence tester has amps as well as volts you can find faults by working along the fence testing as you go - the amps reading will be high before the fault then drop to zero past it. If you don\u2019t have that, walk along the fence looking for places where the hot wire is touching anything it shouldn\u2019t, like long grass or uninsulated wires.",

A good copper ground rod should be driven deep.\n\n3) is there a lot of weed growth along the fence?  Anything else that could be ahorting it out?\n\n4)  is the charger large enough for the amount of fence you have hooked up?",

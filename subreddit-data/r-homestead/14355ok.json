I have a small North Star) cherry tree that is finally producing.  I got the bird netting on it before the cherries stated to ripen so I\u2019m getting them all!  Might leave a few in the tree and let the birds have the last ones.\n\nWish I could grow citrus here because I would love Meyer lemons.",

Just need to bring it inside around October and back out in spring (in both directions I harden it off a little at a time so it isn't shocked by the temp change). I'm in zone 6a. The fragrance of the blossoms is unbelievable; I really recommend giving it a try.",

Had a good nectarine harvest, despite curl leaf that was out of control (I'd never sprayed, but have started now). Our passionfruit was amazing, hundreds of them, but only ever 5 or 6 a day, it was perfect! Veg patch was also pretty poor. Over the last 2 years I've significantly attacked the walnut tree, and harvest was still really good (I'd never plant one, but it was here and I'm glad we have it, it's over the clothes line, so our clothes don't bake in the sun lol). And I attacked the cherry tree pretty hard, as it was just way too tall, and got 3/4 of last years harvest, so still pretty good. Our lemon tree is just coming in now. Got a good crop of mandarin's coming too. And after 2 full years, I've finally got 4 wonderful pomegranates, the ben hurr's haven't set, but from what I read, they are not as productive as the wonderful.\n\nBut we got some raised garden beds, and OMG my veges look the best they ever have, so now working hard on building compost up to keep them productive.",

                            "comment": "Your beautiful grains deserve an awesome recipe! You should try for a rye sourdough if you can. But it really shouldn't be 100% rye. A few things about your loaf -- it's super dense, there's really no active fermentation/gas expansion that occurred inside. You also cooked it at too low of a temperature, which means it didn't develop a nice dark crust on the outside, while simultaneously expanding on the inside. As for flavor, a mixture of flours will help. To make a 600 gram loaf, try this:\n\nIngredients Required:\n\n*  250 grams of rye\n\n* 350 grams of high protein content, white bread flour\n\n* 120 grams of very active sourdough starter (look into some YouTube videos about how to get one going if you can't borrow from a friend or local bakery, basically you mix water and flour on your counter for a couple days until it starts to rise/double over the course of 8 hours or so. When it's doubled, that's when you'd start making your dough)\n\n* 15 grams of salt\n\n* 450 grams of ROOM TEMP water (which is 75% hydration dough, 450/600)\n\nTools Needed:\n\n*  Mixing bowl\n* Kitchen cloth\n* Bread banneton or a small colander lined with a kitchen cloth\n* A cast iron 5.5 quart dutch oven with a lid\n* Parchment paper\n\nInstructions:\n\nIn a large mixing bowl, start by mixing your 120 grams of very active sourdough starter with the 450 grams of water. Incorporate well, and it should look like cloudy/murkey water now. Add in your 250 grams of rye, 350 grams of white bread flour, and the 15 grams of salt. Use a clean hand to basically \"hand mix\" all of the contents in the bowl. So imagine what a bread-hook on a machine does, do that same motion with your hand. You can achieve this by holding the mixing bowl under your arm on one side, and then basically sticking your other hand in the mixture, and spinning your hand clockwise to make sure everything is incorporated.\n\nWe don't want to overmix here, just until everything is nice and homogenized. The end result should be a very wet, shaggy looking dough. Make sure to scrape down the sides, and that all the dough is centered at the bottom, and then cover the mixing bowl with a kitchen cloth, and leave it alone on your counter for 45 minutes. During this time, gluten will begin to form which helps strengthen the dough, and will help it have shape and a great crust later on.\n\nAt this point, a youtube video on the subject would be your best friend, but I will do my best to describe the rest of the process. Your are now going to be doing a series of folding exercises, every 30 minutes, for the next 2 hours -- in other words, 4 series of dough folding. Each time you fold the dough, you're helping it develop strength, and you will notice is gradually turn from a wet, shaggy mess, to something that feels firm, has form, and is easier to manipulate.\n\nAfter that initial 45 minute wait, you are ready for the first folding exercise. Remove your kitchen cloth cover from the bowl, and with a slightly damp hand (you can run it under the faucet and then shake it off), reach into the bowl and grab about HALF of the dough on the side opposite you. Pull it up and out of the bowl until it feels like the tension will break, and FOLD it towards you over the other half of the dough mass still in the mixing bowl. Now rotate your bowl 45 degrees, and repeat this fold. Rotate 45 degrees again, and fold. And do that once more. You should have folded the dough now, 4 times. Cover your mixing bowl with the kitchen cloth, and wait 30 minutes before repeating the above folding exercise.\n\nAgain, you will be doing that series of 4 folds, FOUR times, once every 30 minutes for two hours. As you work the dough during each folding cycle, you'll notice it feels stiffer/firmer, is easier to work with, and is no longer a shaggy mess.\n\nAs an advanced note, if you feel like your dough is not firming up after 4 bowl rotations, you can give it a little more love and do 2 or 3 more extra rotations with a fold toward you. The goal here, again, is to ensure we are developing enough gluten and structure in the dough.\n\nThis final part is the most complicated portion of the bread making process. After the series of 4 folding exercises, you are ready to SHAPE your dough. Again, I recommend YouTube for this portion, but I will do my best.\n\nDust a large cutting board, or other clean surface with some white flour. Perform one more folding exercise in the mixing bowl (essentially a 5th folding exercise), and then empty your taught/firm dough on to the flour-dusted cutting board. Place your bowl upside down over the dough, and let sit for 20 minutes. This is called a \"bench rest\" and is the last time we are letting the dough relax, before a final shaping occurs -- and it ultimately helps us achieve the final shape of the dough. During that 20 minute wait, vigorously flour your bread banneton or line a small colander with a clean kitchen cloth and dust flour all over it. We will be placing our dough into this vessel, and it's important there is a thin coating of flour all over the cloth to ensure the dough does not stick when we remove it later.\n\nOnce the 20 minutes is over. Remove the mixing bowl covering the dough. You will notice it has relaxed somewhat, and flattened out a bit. With your hands, stretch out the dough over your surface, into the shape of a rectangle about 6 to 8 inches wide, and 10-12 inches long. Make sure the shorter sides are oriented towards you, with the longer sides to the left and right. Now using two hands, grab 1/3 of the dough on one of the LONG sides, and fold it over onto itself (like you're folding a piece of paper in thirds). Now do this for the other long side as well.\n\nNow for this next part, you're essentially going to roll the dough in front of you like a joint/hand-rolled cigarette. Grab either the far side or the near side, initially start by pulling the length of dough up and away from the remaining mass, and then proceed to roll it as tightly as possible. Take your time hear, and ensure you can feel the taughtness of the dough as you roll.\n\nWhen finished, take your shaped mass of dough, and place it SEAM SIDE UP into your banneton or cloth-covered colander. Dust the now nested dough with some additional flour, and then use the cloth it's sitting in or an additional one to cover it once more. Then place the banneton/colander with the dough in your refrigerator for 10-12 hours.\n\nWhen ready to bake. Start by pre-heating your oven WITH the cast iron dutch oven inside already, to 450F for at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, grab a plate that is larger than the top of your colander/banneton and place a large piece of parchment paper on top of it. Remove your colander/banneton from the fridge, remove the cloth covering it. Then place the plate with the parchment paper on it, upside down over the colander, so the parchment is closest to the dough. While grabbing the whole art-piece hear, quickly flip it all upside down, to nicely drop the dough onto the parchment paper on the plate.\n\nTake a razor or sharp knife, and make a long score into the dough, from one end to the other, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep. If possible, make this cut at a 45-degree angle in relation to the surface of the dough! (This will help get you a gorgeous ear when it bakes).\n\nWith oven mitts, carefully but quickly remove the pre-heated cast iron dutch oven from your oven and remove the top. Grab each of the four corners of the parchment paper, joining them together over your dough as a swaddle of sorts, and gently place both the parchment paper and the dough into the cast iron dutch oven.\n\nQuickly place the cover back on the dutch oven, and place the dutch oven back in your... oven. Bake the dough for 20 minutes, and then remove the lid from the dutch oven, and bake your bread for another 25 minutes.\n\nRemove and cool on a wire rack for 2-3 hours before cutting into your bread :)\n\nEnjoy!",

Most people mix rye with wheat flour so it'll be lighter. \n\nMost of the rising was done by the yeast, and the recipe said to let it rise in the pan before baking and it'll rise about 20 percent more in the oven, but it didn't really seem to rise anymore for me while baking.\n\nThe recipe also said to let it fully cool before cutting so all the \"vegetable gums can solidify\".\n\nI also probably could have ground it up a little more so the flour itself was lighter.",

The grain binder cuts the wheat/oats/barley/rye etc and ties it into a bundle with twine. Several bundles are leaned up against each other in the field to form a \"shock\" where it sits to dry. When dry, they are picked up and put on a hayrack and taken back to the farm where a steam traction engine powers a threshing machine with a long flat belt. The bundles are fed into the thresher where it separates the grain from the chaff and straw. Grain is augered out into a wagon while the straw is blown into a pile to be hand fed into a square baler the next day. This probably takes about a dozen people in the family to harvest the little bit that gets planted.",

The tiller was so strong it drug me around the yard, for reference I'm 250#. can't recommend them enough\r  \nKilling off remaining weed seeds by pulling the tarps back and letting them sprout then tarping it again. grading the yard for drainage, got 20 yards topsoil spread, about 40-ish more to go.\r  \nI'm finishing the yard with multiple raised beds and planters with brick paths between. zero grass = zero mowing and exponentially more plants. can't beat THAT!!",

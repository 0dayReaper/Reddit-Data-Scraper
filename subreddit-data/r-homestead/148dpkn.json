Even in the dry season the sun is almost too much for a lot of the herbs we've planted. Citrus, chilli's and peppers do quite well though.\n\nCurrently it's a race against time to get what we can growing and established so we can harvest before summer begins in a few months. Then after that all you can grow is chilli's apparently \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

    "postText": "Does anyone have experience with vermicompost toilets, particularly for dealing with blackwater from a camper? I'm going to be living on my farm in a camper for a few years while I save up money to build. No septic system, and I don't have an easy way to move the camper to empty the tank, so I'm considering other options. Vermicompost seems cheaper than the composting toilets I've seen, while being less of a pain than a sawdust toilet. I'm curious what others have done.",

            "comment": "After experimenting for many years with various toilets without a septic system, I have found the best setups come from the Swedish company Separett, which separate urin and feces, and compost the feces away from the toilet. They have indoor systems and parts you can install in an outhouse.",

I\u2019d suggest the 4-8\u2019 ones that self drain so they don\u2019t freeze and deep enough not to worry about it freezing or being driven on if either are a real concern. \n\nBasiclay could be 400 to thousands. \n\nIf you have a shovel you could do some of the work to save money and pay a plumber if you\u2019re not comfortable to connect to your house. You also could do it all by researching it\u2019s not a hard job.",

Trench has to be at least 18\" deep, maybe more depending on where you are. Then install what is called a frost free hydrant and you're done. You're looking at a few hundred in materials, then whatever labor there is to trench and install everything.",

If you are the least bit handy buy some pvc cutter and pipe and fittings and get to work. You\u2019ll be way happier that you did it yourself and learned along the way.",

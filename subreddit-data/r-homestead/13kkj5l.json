The only limit to population growth is food supply, nesting space, and predation. \n\nSo either A) remove all possible nesting space and rat travel routes (shade from the open sky) within 500 feet of the house.  Which is practically impossible for homesteaders, with all the sheds, shrubbery, fences, etc. \n\nOr B) remove their food source.  Chicken food, garden veggies, etc.  Make it unaccessable to even the sneakiest rat, which can chew through nearly anything but steel, and fit through any hole bigger than a dime.  \n\nOr C) encourage natural predation.  Birds of prey, snakes, foxes, weasels, some cats and dogs. Night-time hunters will have more success as rats are nocturnal.\n\nI use a combination of all 3 methods. I don't currently have chickens so no chicken food. My garden is surrounded by wide open space exposed to the sky. I cleared away shrubs and everything within 20 feet of my house.  And I live somewhere with a strong hawk population and neighborhood cats.  Never seen one rat.  \n\nMy last house we had chickens, an unprotected garden, rat routes all over, and a suburban house, thus too many cars for predators to thrive.  Always had rats. Until we found their rat nest inside our fence, but then they just moved a couple houses down.\n\nYou can poison and trap a thousand rats.  Outside rats will not stop having babies and they can always immigrate. You must take away their food and shelter, and add predation.  Make your property a hostile enviornment.  Poison will not help.",

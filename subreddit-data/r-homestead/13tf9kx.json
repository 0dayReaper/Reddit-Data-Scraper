Flow hives are just a fancy gimmick that is fleecing the unknowledgeable.\n\n\\+ You'll want more than one hive anyway.",

I didn't have to build it, just assemble from flat pack and it was easy for me, but many reviews had complaints.\n\nI appreciate how there are side panels with plexiglass to inspect without disturbing or stressing the bees, and similarly for the concept of extracting the honey without taking the whole hive apart.\n\nI'm allergic to bees, but understand how necessary they are for pollinating and gardening. I do not have grandiose ideas of lots of free honey because they need it to survive the winter. Also, I understand having a hive is much like having barnyard chickens to save the birds. I do splash in some anise extract every spring, but location hasn't been attractive enough as of yet to capture a wild native hive. \n\nMaybe I will change my tune about it, but for now I am happy to look at the cute thing in the yard.",

If you can give them a 2x4 or something that\u2019s a little bit taller than the chick warmer they will enjoy that.\n\nEdit: also, we start feeding them greens after the first week or so.  You can chop up some grass or lettuce to get them started.  They catch on quickly!",

It can cause mold which just increases disease risk. This gets easier as your waterer gets bigger. With that many birds may take like a 12 gallon waterer. That will also decrease how frequently you have to refill it.",

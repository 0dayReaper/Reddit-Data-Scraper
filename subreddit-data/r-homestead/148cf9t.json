    "postText": "So we have 3 guinea hens that were very protective and mothering the turkeys we got.  They free ranged together for a couple weeks but then turned on the turkeys and nearly killed one. \nJust the 3 Guineas have made a noticeable difference in our tick population around the house so we want to raise more. I figure we missed some key points to ensure they could roam together with turkeys. Any tips for the next time around? Iv been given the task of processing the 3 we have and starting fresh, so any tips on that end would be appreciated too. I am a fan of dark meat But my mother and her husband are picky. The turks are BBW so they will be for Thanksgiving anyway. Then we want some that can breed without Hemp.",

            "comment": "We have turkeys, guineas, chickens and Muscovy ducks.  \n\nTurkeys and guineas - work together great in theory.  They are both a-holes with their territory.  It\u2019s ok they DO work together great. \n\nThe issue is age and breeds.  The BB turkeys grow fast but still, it takes a while.  Heritage breeds take a really long time.  Any size difference will cause pecking orders to try to establish.  Don\u2019t mix them young but let them be near each other.  When BOTH are grown they work better than when growing up.  \n\nRelated - again we keep turkeys.  Blending the flock together with other young ones is difficult.  As I add more babies (large enough for the field) the older ones will try to push their place in the pecking order.  This is bird specific.  We had to find the right birds that want to grow the flock - some want to kill the young ones.  Our Tom\u2019s all welcome youngsters but one hen doesn\u2019t so much like them.  We removed a few that would kill them already.  \n\nTLDR - we can all give advice but this is very bird specific.  Ideas we have won\u2019t always give you your direct answer as what worked for us may not work for you as again every bird is different.",

If a bird is overly aggressive with the family , it goes to the smoker. We try to weed out the bad apples and only keep the best behaved and friendly . We will give it another try, giving more attention to them and growing them together.",

    "postText": "I have a skunk that seems to live under our chicken coop now. I'm worried about trying to shoot it and then it crawls into its hole and dies smelling the neighborhood from the chicken coop for a long time. Is trapping it then killing it the best way to go? What's the best way to dispose of it once killed? Paying someone is way too expensive and I'm trying to keep from my family and animals from getting sprayed and harassed. I've run into it around the coop at dusk too many times trying to shut the girls in for the night.",

I recommend keeping a large Rubbermaid tote handy with a lid to put the trap in while transporting - if it sprays you'll contain it in the tote, and the tote is easier to pull out of a truck without worry of getting sprayed.\n\nWe haven't had any skunk problems since.",

If you shoot a skunk, it will spray immediately\n\nYou can google lots of other dispatch methods, but you might not like them. If you don\u2019t care about your trap getting stinky, you can cover the trap with a towel or something, then once it\u2019s caught, you can move it to somewhere you don\u2019t mind it spraying and shoot it there.",

            "comment": "1) Purchase large cage traps - rated raccoon size, usually about 10\" x 12\" x 30\" or so.\n\n2) Set traps in areas of high skunk activity. Bait with marshmallows, or, if stray cats are not a problem in the area, cat food works as well. Make sure traps are scent-free and flush to the ground, and set in the shade.\n\n3) Relocate any trapped skunk at least 10 miles from capture site.\n\n4) If you have skunk living under a deck, shed, or other structure, install an exclusion barrier - steel mesh around the perimeter, and down at least 12 into the ground, with bottom of mesh sloping outward.\n\n\n\nYou could also just be patient and make sure you get a good shot when it\u2019s in a decent area where spray won\u2019t matter as much. \n\n\nIt\u2019s probably going to spray when you trap it anyways. And you need to relocate it pretty far away, like 10 miles. Don\u2019t want it coming back.",

            "comment": "I had trouble with skunks getting under my house earlier this year. I caught him outside one morning and tapped him twice with a .22, on in the head, one in the chest. The way he flopped over I thought for sure he didn\u2019t survive, so I put my gun down. He somehow survived long enough to crawl back under the house, crawl into a deep dark crevice to die. (In case you\u2019re wondering, he took a while to find). With all that being said, please do not relocate a skunk just so he can be someone else\u2019s problem. \n\nLearn your lesson from me. Trap the skunk with a cage trap, cover it with a tarp or old blanket, and kill it. If you want a smell free kill, drown it (barrel, pond, etc.) it\u2019s just a skunk. \n\nIf you decide to catch him outside and shoot it, make sure you bring a bigger round than a .22 to keep him from going back under you coop and dying, that\u2019s a pain to deal with, trust me.",

    "postText": "Thank goodness for family. Me, my dad, and brother planted 24 fruit trees, 7 blueberry bushes, and 7 raspberry bushes all in one day in some seriously hard clay dry soil. \n\nThis was recommended to me by every homesteader to get this started as soon as possible. So almost $1000 later, we got everything in the ground and watered with three days of rain expected! \n\nHere\u2019s to a self sustained future !",

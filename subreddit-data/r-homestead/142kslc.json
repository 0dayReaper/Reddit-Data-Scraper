I've done pork head before but never cow. \nI skinned it, washed it and left it overnight on a salt water brine to remove any blood excess. \n\nBut I'm unsure if I should remove the jaw for example to better clean the inside of the mouth or if there are any glands or something that might affect the taste.\n\nThe plan is to smoke it whole and then finish it in the oven",

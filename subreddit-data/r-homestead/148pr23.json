    "postText": "Does anyone have and experience or know of any good resources on seasoning logs in the extreme SE US? We\u2019re re-doing my families old corn crib that was built in the 1860\u2019s (or so). It\u2019s made up of mostly old fat liter logs and red cedar. A number of the logs have termite damage and rot and need replaced. I have plenty of timber yo choose from and thought that now would be the best time to start cutting since the sap content of the timber is extremely high this time. I\u2019ve heard that many old timers just laid the logs in burning coals or wood chops to get the moisture out. Any help would be appreciated.",

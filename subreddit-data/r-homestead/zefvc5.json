I fully embraced my inner cat lady before I was homesteading; but, it's something people should think about because you might not be able to find someone.

One of my big dreams is to move out of the south and up into the northeast and get a little homestead. As kids this dream was one he supported. Now, ten years later, we\u2019re in a house in the suburbs and getting him to move or acknowledge this idea I\u2019ve been chasing since 19 is almost impossible. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s out of reach, but I\u2019m spending more time convincing him that the lifestyle I want is one he\u2019ll enjoy too. I could be living that way now but instead I\u2019m trapped in the suburbs in the wrong state because I didn\u2019t choose a partner who also wanted to live out. \n\nI\u2019m not ready to give up on the marriage or the dream so I just feel like I\u2019m in limbo all the time.

When crisis got worse back in 2017 and it was time to head for the hills...she said \"**I\u00b4m not going to live in THOSE CONDITIONS like a peasant!!**\". Mind you, she grew up in a countryside house with chickens, goats and all the related stuff. I mean, if she would have been raised in Manhattan, OK. I would understand. So I was practically forced to flee the country and live the worst time of my life. After all the craziness the pandemics brought along (we were living in Peru) and what I was witnessing, I decided to came back. We were no longer a couple since 2018. Our only child wanted to come back with me, as we were living in poor conditions whenever we own our home in one of the best neighborhoods of a former oil production city very prosperous, my parents live in their own home, and we have a cabin in the mountains. Nowadays we\u00b4re living the way my child and I want, and we\u00b4re happier than ever. Maybe penniless, but that\u00b4s temporary.",

But many people don't. The two of you may be in a completely different place, but if you each have that branch that says \"homesteader\", you can work towards your goal. \n\n(Totally not knocking your metaphor. I just really like metaphors and talking about them especially in regards to life, just because I don't think life is small enough to talk about without invoking some metaphors.)",

But getting woken up on a Sunday because the septic is clogged, digging it out yourself then finding just the right container to fit under the bathroom leak in the closest so your husband can take a shower, then thinking about how long it can be until your hot water renews so YOU can take a shower. Then (not homestead related just, in the middle of construction related), replacing the tubs in the bathtub so you can wash the dishes since the kitchen sink is still down\u2026. This is sometimes a lot. The crazy thing is that I don\u2019t even consider ourselves a homestead, just rural living on a budget with a love for gardening &amp; the ability to trade with neighbors. I remember telling my grandfather that if he was ever bored he should stop by, he laughed &amp; said \u201coh I\u2019m never bored\u201d I live in his house now &amp; I get it. Ohhhh I get it. Keeps life interesting though. So I\u2019m not complaining (as long as you ignore my previous complaints \ud83d\ude02) Having a horny partner to live it with me makes it all worth it though!!",

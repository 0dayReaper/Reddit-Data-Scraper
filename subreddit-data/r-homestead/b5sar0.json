What that means is that you could probably get away with some back alley private party sales, but technically if you sell them on craigslist You are supposed to be licensed and your name will appear in the animal welfare act database. Presumably this is to prevent puppy mills that operate in in an unethical manner and I have not really heard of any cases where a private individual just has a lot of dogs.\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/legislative-alerts/usda-aphis-finalizes-rule-impacting-pet-breeders/",

Poor girl was thin and covered in matts and ticks but we had her for 14 years before she got sick and we had to put her down. I don\u2019t think my pawpaw ever intentionally got a dog. They all just showed up on his farm and he took care of them. Notable dogs include Dog, Pooch, Girl, Boy, Trouble, Little Bit, and T2 (trouble two). He was not the most creative of men. Lol. ",

I grew up with a Labradoodle and too this day he was the best trained dog I have ever met! I highly, highly recommend checking out r/puppy101. They really help prepare you to deal with puppy blues and helping raise a pup. I would tell them your story if you haven\u2019t yet, I\u2019m sure they would also be a great help in training through any trauma she might have, and answering any questions you may have. My partner and I used that subreddit a lot and it really helped supplement training and gave us a lot of really helpful ideas! Good luck with Teddy!! Please jeep us updated!",

More than likely it was backyard breeding. \n\nIf you don\u2019t bother to track or show at LEAST 3 generations back and any health issues, cover all three initial puppy vaccinations, and have a health guarantee in place where you will take back the dog if it develops health issues related to the breed, you\u2019re a backyard breeder. Other red flags include more than one litter from the same bitch in the same year. People who care about their dogs and the puppies they produce won\u2019t overbreed them. \n\nTo simplify, if you\u2019re paying $100-$500 for a dog and there isn\u2019t any agreement that you have to supply a record of a vet visit in a certain time frame, congratulation, you\u2019re likely supporting backyard breeding. \ud83d\ude21\n\nA well bred pure-breed dog should be costing you $600-$2,000 and there is likely a waiting list.

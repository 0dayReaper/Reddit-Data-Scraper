    "postText": "So I actually have land all lined up thats already paid for, but won't be able to move onto it until I get a well, a septic system, and electricity set up on the land, as well as setting up a home(haven't decided what kind yet just that we need at least 3 bedrooms) on the property. It's about 30acres in Oklahoma.\n\nAfter we get those basics set up we can start a garden and once that's flourishing, we can start raising animals for food and materials.\n\nI want to figure out costs to save up and get it all done around the same time, the problem is that I don't know where to go to figure out how much these things cost. Any advice or links to trustworthy sources of information, ect is welcome and I thankyou for your time!",

There's stuff you'd hire someone for, and stuff you'd rent/buy equipment for and DIY. \n\nRurally, your options for who to hire in outsourcing a job can be quite limited. The further away a contractor has to travel from, the more their services will cost, so outside a certain radius it's prohibitive to try to bring someone non-local in. \n\nStart with the well. How much does a well cost? That depends on the depth and the contractor. You won't know the depth for sure till it's drilled, but you can guesstimate. You can look up county well records and see how deep neighboring wells are. You can research pump and well companies in the area, phone them, and ask them for a guesstimate of what they often see similar projects costing, plus what common surprises increase the cost. \n\nElectricity set up -- again there are probably only 1-2 power companies in the area. Call those companies for an estimate of what it'd cost to get a new utility service to the land. \n\nPhone line, same thing. \n\nSeptic, same thing. Figure out who you'd hire to come install it, call around and ask them their rates and availability. \n\nHouses, evaluate your options. Lots of people live in a trailer or RV while setting things up on a new house site. Your primary options are stick-built or manufactured. If you're borrowing money, identify prospective lenders (some professions have access to better loan options than the general public, like military), and make sure they'll actually lend on the house type you want.\n\nThen figure out who you'd be buying the house from, if you wanna just buy one, and price out what the various options would cost. \n\nWhen building a house, get the best you can afford on stuff that's permanent (windows, wall insulation, roofing, etc) and the cheapest you can get on stuff you'd be comfortable upgrading later (faucets, lighting, draperies).",

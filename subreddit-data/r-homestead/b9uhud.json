I wish I could make one like this, but \"chicken wire\" and quarter inch hardware cloth isn't actually for keeping chickens safe in my neck of the woods, and the wind would blow it over, and the birds would die from exposure (again, wind). I'm glad you don't have to guard against the snakes and skunks and possums and foxes who'd go right thru here. So cute!!",

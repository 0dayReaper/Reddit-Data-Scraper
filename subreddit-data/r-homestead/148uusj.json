I started the last Saturday\n\nI added 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup water.  next day remove 1/2 and add 1/2 cup flour and water.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vzhn4pqdxv5b1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b640128539eccc67a9d902a08bd50dec5108375d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8n0y4qqdxv5b1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=383affe1628517bc71fdafdf3e5e15ee8f6abde4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhsqkrqdxv5b1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fd32d38dafbde236e8427b8b83863f1beac2cf6e",

That splitting is due to a high water content, which won't really affect the health of it, but some people suggest a more watery starter imparts more subtle yogurt bites while a stiffer starter imparts more sour notes. Use your eyes and nose to determine it's health. If there's no off scents or colors, you're golden.\n\nI don't even measure my feedings anymore. Pour out until about 1/8 of jar left, add flour until vessel is about 1/3 full, add water until it's mixes evenly, sometimes more viscous and sometimes less. A lot of people like to overcomplicate starters and there's a lot of patently false juju surrounding them (like SF starters being special in some way). Once you're off the ground after a few days, just feed it everyday and let the bugs do their thing. Also, once things are off the ground and if you start feeling lazy, you can feed and pop it into the fridge and get away with 1 feeding/weekish (I've gone a little longer to no I'll effects but wouldn't push it too far)",

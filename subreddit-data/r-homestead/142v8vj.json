So we're doing a lot of clean up first, Then we plan on having a small orchard of stone fruit trees (cherries, nectarines, apples, etc) some raised garden beds enough to supplement our normal food, and do some canning, we plan on having some chickens/goats. We have our own well, and are on septic, and plan on doing some rain water reclamation. we're focused on some form of self sufficiency.",

Don\u2019t have any major attractors out for them (lush plants etc), it\u2019s just a convenient stroll given the improved road surface passing by. But there\u2019s plenty of other, better places for them to lolligag further out so I want to convey the message without getting into a major fencing project\u2026thoughts?",

I don\u2019t mind their presence generally at a little distance from home base, but they can cause problems and leave a mess interfering with the \u2018people zone\u2019 up close. Thought they might want to avoid human structures, but nope! My \u2018virtual fencing\u2019 scheme so far is a BB gun, which does seem to do the trick when I\u2019m on the lookout, not sure if it leaves a permanent (virtual!) mark in their thick brains though, to avoid the area when I\u2019m not here\u2026",

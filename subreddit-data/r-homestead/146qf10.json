Some of them were still giving lots of fruit (apples) but very obviously sick \u2014 mostly rot while still on the tree.\n\nI've cut the trees already so don't have pictures to properly identify all the deceases.\n\nI'm in the process of mulching the branches and cutting the trunks for fire wood. What should I do with the mulch \u2014 is it dangerous to use it for our flower garden and around other vegetation? it's very useful resource and I'd hate to have to let it rot.",

            "comment": "Probably zero issue if using it around non-woody plants. If using it around woody plants, the main risk is if the infection affected the roots. Infections of leaves, branches, and the trunk are unlikely to spread via mulch. That's because the pathogens sink downward into the soil from the mulch.",

            "comment": "If you don't know what the issue was it's hard to know if it's transmissible. I do know people prize apple wood for smokehouses as long as it's not been used with chemicals so often abandoned orchards are a resource for that. And that can also be an issue with wood chips, know the contamination might be from farming drift as well if you are in a big agriculture area.\n\nToo bad you cut them because many varieties of apple tree are amazingly regenerative and even some pretty sick looking trees can be grafted to and brought back. \n\nI just worked in an orchard of about forty trees this spring that was abandoned for close to sixty years and about the half trees were close to or over a hundred years.. so mostly broken and very unruly. We added more modern varieties of fruit via graft to twenty five and with a few more seasons of steady pruning, the whole place should be popping again with some heritage apples. \n\nCompanion planting and Integrated pest management go a long way to maintenance of any orchard. I'd look into your local university or county extension for tips in your area and relative timing but The Holistic Orchard by Michael Phillips is a wonderful resource.",

If I were, I\u2019d sell the wood for smokers as it\u2019s guaranteed to be clean.\n\nNone of the local \u201cheritage\u201d apples are worth saving wrt their taste and qualities. I never thought about grafting, that could\u2019ve been great idea. I have enough heritage trees already in another place and they are good only for making apple juice.\n\nAnyway, for me it\u2019s preferable if I start over with young trees",

            "comment": "So, it would be much easier to give a clear answer if we identified the \"disease\" - which could very well just be deficiency. Then, it would only be an issue if you were mulching around species that can either carry or express that disease (which is unknown until it is identified). \n\nApples are in a huge massive gigantic plant family. Roses are a prominent carrier of diseases like apple blight. But everything from strawberries to chamomile is related closely enough to catch &amp; carry apple diseases. \n\nProbably the best course of action would be to pile the mulch and just let it age 2 or 3 years in isolation before bringing it around plants that could potentially catch and carry a disease. Or, you could post some photos and we could help identity the illness or issue?\n\nIf they're suffering from really any issue, be it disease or deficiency, the fruit will not be a good representation of what the tree can produce. Furthermore, some of the most uncommon, rare, valuable varietals are cider breeds and are far too sour to seem amazing as fruit. Many many have been lost since prohibition, and you might could be sitting on something that people would pay $600 for a single scion of. I'm not saying that's likely, I'm just saying, \"apple taste yucky\" is not a good reason to cut down a mature tree.\n\nAlso consider, if you were to plant another fruit tree of any kind, chances are you'll be dead by the time its as big as these. So just, understand the permanence of what you're doing, understand that they're probably saveable, and understand that people like me value a small orchard over a house when shopping for property, and if you ever want to sell you're shooting yourself in the foot by removing them.... My 2 cents...",

Wasn\u2019t aware roses could carry this disease, thanks for the insight! This means I\u2019m better off of I don\u2019t use this mulch for our roses.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am going to be installing a 2\" sand well point and have some questions I am hoping you all can help answer. Before I go into the questions this well point is going to be used for watering our garden with wobbler sprinklers, along with a potential future lawn irrigation system for 3/4-1 acre My questions are as follows.\n\n1. I am going to be renting a electric jackhammer to drive the 2\" pipe into the ground. That being said I know you're supposed to use drive couplings, however I saw someone made a comment somewhere on the forums saying to remove the drive couplings once installed and that confused me....Can't I just use drive couplings for each section of pipe and leave it in there?\n2. I was planning on using teflon tape for each connection. Should I also be using pipe dope for each section of pipe as added protection?\n3. I am looking to irrigate the garden and potentially a future lawn sprinkler system for 1 acre. I know the size of the pump is going to be contingent upon the flow of water, and I don't want the pump to outrun the flow of water but I am thinking of going with a 1HP pump from Harbor Freight and a 14 gallon pressure tank. I am going to have to reduce the pipe from 2\" to the 1 1/4\" inlet but I am hoping this is correctly sized.\n4. If I go with this [1HP Harbor Freight Pump](https://www.harborfreight.com/1-hp-cast-iron-shallow-well-pump-with-pressure-control-switch-63752.html) will I have to upgrade to a 20 amp circuit or larger? I will have an electrician wire this for me, however just looking to understand if there's any caveats I might encounter before trenching a line for the electrical.\n5. Will I regret going with either a Harbor Freight or Pump from Menards, or is there not much a difference quality wise vs other brands found online?",

            "comment": "I\u2019m not super sure about the irrigation side of things but I know you should use a sacrificial nipple with drive cap attached to your well pipe. That way when the drive cap destroys the threads on your pipe your it\u2019s not the one that will stay in the ground and you can simply add pipe as you go, then add the coupler then the short sacrificial nipple",

The connection between the well point filter/screen and the 1st solid section of pipe, does that have to be a drive cap fitting as well?  I assume so since it will be eventually transferring the force from above to the lower sections of pipe, but to me that is unclear.",

As far as I could tell as long as the couplers were tight there was no visible damage to my point or pipe. (I have since jacked my sand point out)",

We had to clean up old farm middens (dumps) when bought cause farmers usually have a corner they dumped junk they couldn\u2019t burn or recycle. One spot was a glass pile that has taken years to clean up as the frost cycle exposes old glass from  the decades ago.Not worth the occasional interesting bottle to have a place where glass can cut through your shoe. It washes into the stream and periodically I stream walk to pick up what I can . Also find asbestos siding washes down from somewhere . My old mans farm we found they used a natural spring as a dump and poisoned the damn stream with the fluids left in old fluids containers like oil and brake cleaner. We had to back hoe out tons of soil and apply bioremediation and create a berm to keep the runoff out of the creek. Now we have a swampy wood lot. I have seen a lot of problems with pollution on old farms that way. I try to say they didn\u2019t know back then but I still get pissed at the waste.",

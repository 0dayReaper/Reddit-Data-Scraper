            "comment": "Hello, Due to the encouragement I received from the other groups. I wanted to share my story with you all wonderful people and I hope this will inspire you. I am a South Indian, born and raised in the city of UAE (Al Ain). It\u2019s a city with very few plants and flowers. My dad comes from a family of farmers and working in the UAE as an engineer so with little knowledge he started planting basic plants such as Mint, Moringa, Curry plant, Aloe Vera, Tomato, Tapioca. Due to the heat and not so fertile soil, the harvest has been very low but we enjoyed working side by side. Those are the fondest memories I have with my father.\u00a0\n\nIn Kerala (India) the plot in which our house is built used to have a couple of coconut trees and jackfruit tree. We didn\u2019t plant anything until now as we didn't have anyone to take care of our land. But due to COVID we got stuck here since January and hasn\u2019t been able to go back to Dubai since. Due to fear of food shortages, we started using our three plots for farming. I could actively take part in all activities and I love to experiment (Dad doesn't). I have grown Beetroot greens, Potatoes and Sweet potato from scraps and they aren\u2019t common crops in Kerala. We have planted plant of plenty of Tapioca, Indian yam, Colocasia, Elephant yam, Long beans, Small Chilli, Ladyfinger, Chilli, Ginger, Papaya, Neem, Moringa, Rhambutan and Tumeric. We have added passion fruit, more papayas, lemon, Giant lemon, Custard apple (sitaphal) and Sapotica (chicku) to our tree collection.\n\nI have also started a YouTube channel and blog to document these journeys and talk about different culture through gardening. My dad was a camera man, recently we came to know that we both are COVID positive and he has been transferred to a hospital. My relatives and friends aren\u2019t very supportive because they think gardening is a waste of time. But I love doing this and eating fresh from the garden is x10 times tastier than buying from the market. I have started educating people about importance of organic varieties and how to grow organically. I also started a food sharing and seed sharing program in our society. We ensure to share the produce with the less fortunate as they wouldn\u2019t accept money. \n\nI make videos talking about the benefits, growing, harvesting and cooking vegetables such as banana flower, ladyfinger/ okra, bottle gourd/ doodhi (Lauki). This way the viewer can understand everything about a crop and learn how to use it as well. I am no expert; I still post my doubts on Facebook but I AM DETERMINED TO TURN EVERY INCH OF MY LAND INTO FOOD FOREST! This is how I plan to give back to my society.\n\nYou can check out my channel here and if you enjoyed them, then please subscribe to support me (no pressure). If you\u2019re a blogger or Journalist, feel free to collaborate with me. Thank you and have a good day!\n\nYoutube-\u00a0[https://youtu.be/lR\\_FlqfTQH4](https://youtu.be/lR_FlqfTQH4)  \nPaypal - [https://paypal.me/sijoz](https://paypal.me/sijoz)",

Perhaps you already know this program, it's world-wide.  Some of their workers come to learn what it's truly like to have your own farm, they're usually amazing workers.

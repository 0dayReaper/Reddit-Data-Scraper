They're the only birds I've kept except parakeets when I was a kid, so maybe other birds are easy too. But we check on them morning and evening and fill food and water as needed. I collect eggs every evening. Total time spent each week is like an hour. Super easy.\n\nAlmost all the birds we've lost have been from bad coop design. First coop was cheap to see if we enjoyed raising them. I built a better one last summer and we haven't lost any birds since we put them in it.",

They honestly would make great pets, even if you wanted them inside. \n\nThey need a male present to lay eggs, and the males crow. But I don't think they're as loud as chickens by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nEdit: It would seem I was quite wrong about needing a male present. Idk where I got that from, but nice to learn something new today.",

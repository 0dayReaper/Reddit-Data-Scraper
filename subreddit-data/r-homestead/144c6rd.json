    "postText": "It's been a frustrating 24 hours!  Started with a lamb getting bloat (he's much better now!), the goat kids partially destroying a field shelter (very fixable), then a fox getting into our chicken tractor (6 dead), and finally finding a big pile of red mites in the chicken coop.  None of it is major stuff and we'll deal with it and move on.  It was just a very unexpectedly bumpy 24 hours.\n\nAll I wish for is healthy animals \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb - please, at least for a couple of days so I can tend to the garden!  I have squash to plant.\n\nPosting a few pics of our menagerie just to remind myself that it's all worth the trouble and that I love these little jerks (even the goats).\n\nPS. The cows have caused me no trouble at all. And now that I've said it out loud I'm worried I just jinxed it. \ud83d\udc04",

It was so sad and disappointing coming out to that this morning \ud83d\ude14 \n\nAs for all the other animals, they should be alright.  The goats are little hellions, though.  Incredibly cute and love a snuggle, but when they aren't cuddling they are invariably causing mischief.",

There was a not-my-rabbit visiting my yard frequently that wasn't doing any noticeable damage for months. I even started watering the ornamental sweet potatoes on purpose because it would munch on those and I didn't care, and refreshed a platter of water for it every day.\n\nSadly, I live near a busy road and I'm pretty sure I saw its body sprawled in the grass median on the way to work on Wednesday. It was a white rabbit, so easy to spot. Poor little thing. It was even starting to not mind me being less than 10 feet away during its breakfast, which is the closest thing it could do to responding when I'd say \"Good morning, bun-bun\".",

I hope you get more visitors, but ones who only eat the plants you designate for them.\n\nI didn't even mention the rabbits in my rant because it'd just be too much, but we have a rabbit that has basically moved into one of my polytunnels.  He was in another one previously and kept digging up my plants, so we blocked up every hole and gap and he disappeared for a day (whoo!) only to make residence in the polytunnel next door (\ud83d\ude11).  We had so much going on this week I just shouted \"fine, you win!\" and I haven't even tried to move him.  So now we have a giant rabbit den in the middle of my plants and I'm literally like whatever, this is the least of my worries, I'll get to him later haha.",

                    "comment": "Yes sure.  \n\nLong answer: we have a fully wired chicken tractor that we move the birds around in daily.  There can be small gaps between the bottom of the tractor and the ground (like an inch or so at most, our land is pretty flat).  We don't have any wire mesh going outwards to prevent digging under because I've found it very difficult to move the tractor with those panels (they get caught on stuff, it's just a hassle), so instead what we do is keep an electrified wire fence, 112cm high, around the tractor at all times.  Unfortunately this was not enough.   The fox must have jumped the fence (we couldn't find any holes but who knows), dug under the tractor and got 6 birds :(\n\nShort answer: fox outsmarted our electric fence + enclosed chicken tractor :(\n\nThis is the first time we have ever had this problem.   Up til now we hadn't had any foxes - that we knew of - on our land or our neighbours.  But now that they're here we will be upping our security big time \ud83d\udea8",

    "postText": "Recently bought 2.6 acres of basically meadow, only 5 trees on the property. and so need a good mower to keep the weeds in check. I don't plan on doing serious farming any time soon, but the property does need some grading done, especially the driveway (about 1/8th mile) and while the weather is pretty mild/dry, it can snow, so it would be nice to keep that driveway clear, and around the garage/carport area. \n\nI don't think I have enough work to justify a compact tractor, so I was looking at garden tractors (which seems to be a step between lawn tractor and full blown tractor) Specifically the Husqvarna TS 354XD. \n\nI don't mind if the work take a bit longer with a garden tractor, since I work from home and I have kids that can do the work as well, I just don't want to buy something that will break the next day or be totally unable to do the work.",

It wasn\u2019t fast.  I eventually upgraded and sold it.  It\u2019s still in use\n\nOnce I had the belt tension right it was reliable. Occasional shear bolt replacement. I learned to keep a couple on hand\n\nI appreciated the snow cab, wheel weights and chains",

Growing up, we had 5 acres and a compact tractor and filled the tires with water, but we used that for a lot more actual work.   \nSnow cab is a maybe. it doesn't get THAT cold here, (Central AZ), so I would be dealing with low 20's at worst, not sub 0 temps.",

If I had the 4 grand back to do over again, I'd look for a real garden tractor like a used Wheel Horse or Case Cub, or something similar. The TS series are just big mowers with a slightly beefier transaxle than the regular lawn mowers.\n\nThe frame is *not* sturdy. You can feel it flex while driving over uneven ground, and that's just while mowing. I wouldn't dream of buying the chintzy bucket lift without reinforcing the side rails first.\n\nI also bought a couple of sleeve hitch implements that might as well be children's toys for all the more work they can do",

I ended up moving most of the large pile by hand with a shovel and wheelbarrow, and then going back with the tractor to level it.\n\nAs for the garden implements, you need 3 cinder blocks on them to get them to bite, and the turf tires just spin with that much weight back there. I need a second set of wheels with ag tires and weights, which will easily run another $800 all told. So it can be done, but you're gonna spend probably $5500-6500 for a capable setup.",

Ask especially about how the parts lead times for various brands compare. \n\nI've been starting the tractor shopping journey myself lately and I notice that used tractors are vastly cheaper than any of the new ones. This comes with pros and cons of course in the maintenance and warranty department...",

The biggest difference is in the running gear/transaxle. \n\nFor example the Husqvarna 354 vs the 248 - Same engine family (nearly identical), but the transaxle on the 354 is a K66 vs the K46 on the 248. The K66 is a much beefier axle that can handle much more torque, static loads and work. \n\n99% of the use lawn tractors I see on CL/FBM/OU/etc. are just that \"lawn tractors\" and not garden tractors. So that eliminates the vast majority of what's out there. I know that they are not up to what I want to do with them.",

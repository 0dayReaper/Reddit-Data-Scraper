Make sure no branches or weeds touch me. But for some reason, for the past several times, I\u2019ve found a deer tick or 2 on me. My arm and or legs. I\u2019m so confused how they are getting to me. I\u2019m so carful not walking through any tall grass or any bushes. No plant matter is touching me. What am I missing? Can they just be on the ground and walk up my foot?",

Ticks often end up in trees (via tagging onto climbing critters) and will fall off of branches. \n\n\nAlso, ticks (especially deer ticks) will still crawl around in grass even if it is cut. A tick will still do it's ticky thing on everything save for scorched earth. \n\n\nThough you can help prevent ticks by tucking pant legs into socks, putting deet on your shoes, insecticide treatments on the trail itself, and double sided tape wrapped around legs (so ticks get stuck to it)",

Pets left untreated will consistently bring them indoors. They\u2019ll climb up on your clothes if you hang dry outside. They are just awful. Also, \u201cScientists have determined that type A blood is the most appealing to ticks, followed by type O and type AB, and type B blood is the least attractive to ticks.

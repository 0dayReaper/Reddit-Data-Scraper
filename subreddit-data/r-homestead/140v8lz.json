There's a reason why you basically only see rammed earth in deserts. Standing water is no bueno for those things. Earth ships really only work in the desert, as well, but that's more due to sun availability.",

They have machines you can set up on site that basically shit out compressed earth blocks that you can then use for construction. \n\nCan even blend in cement to make them water proof. \n\nNot sure if it is the fastest but looks legit.

    "postText": "For the past couple weeks a few fox have been thinning out my flock of chickens. I\u2019ve got two of the three that I\u2019ve seen so far. The first one I took the pelt to tan, and left the carcass in the woods (well away from my house) for some other hungry animal.  The second one I just shot, and it was recommended to me to keep his body nearby to ward off any other fox. Anyone know if that tactic works? I would imagine it would just attract more predators. \n\nGeneric fox pic for attention.",

My Shepard puppies did all my chickens in when they were too young to understand what bad is.  Now that they're grown, they're more disciplined.  Plus I try to give them something good every now and then. raw beef liver, a frew strips of barely g cooked fajita meat, cooked hamburger meat, a half a dozen raw eggs in their food, etc.  They're carnivores.  And even the premium expensive dog food doesn't have enough meat based fats and protiens that the dogs diet needs.  They need raw meat products to stay healthy.\n  So I don't currently have chickens.  But certainly don't have foxes.  I have 4 large dogs that I let plY fight growing up so theyre able to defend themselves and fight off predators. Of course I taught them \"Enough!\" First, and have to remind them of \"no ears, no legs, no throat\" every now and again.  But the packs of Coyotes that were around here have moved out and arent around here anymore.  And I found what was left of 2 or 3 adult foxes up In the woods not too far from a den.  Apparently, the dogs took care of them.   But the yuppie blue s r ate transplants that live around me don't like when my dogs get loose and go romping through the woods; however their precious little yapping dog probably woukdbhave been eaten by foxes or coyotes already had it not been for my little pack of fuckin war bears.lol  2 are 80lb lab mixes. 2 are smaller in size but about equal weight Shepherd mixes.\n\nBut I agree.  Almost everything has a place in the natural order of things.  Even foxes.  Lock the chickens up tight, get a couple livestock protection dogs (do better than I did about keeping them from eating the livestock.lol), grow some tall grass or hedges where wild rabbits can breed and reproduce so that theyres wild food for the foxes.  And maybe take them some eggs as an offering to nature every now and again.  They gotta eat too.  When you destroy the habitste of the foxes natural food source, a d deprive them of any other available means of what would be a natural diet for them, your livestock moves up to the number one spot on their menu.",

There\u2019s only so much \u201creinforcing\u201d that is reasonable in terms of financial costs &amp; labour costs when you could simply shoot the predator killing your livestock. \n\nKilling living things sucks, &amp; foxes are worse for a lot of ppl bc they\u2019re closer to domesticated pets but at the end of the day it\u2019s killing OP\u2019s livestock.",

Either the foxes might cannibalize it... which is bad, because this is how rabies and other prions diseases manifest and spread.  Or it'll attract a predator that might see the foxes as food.   A bobcat or something like that is a little easier to keep out than foxes. \n\nAlso... you're kinda right.  But why not mark eggs, candle and collect them when they're 3-4 days old, and leave any fertile ones to hatch out.  You could make enough to feed yourself and throw the foxes a bone every now and again.\n\nThis is another problem that we create.  When you destroy the habitat and reduce the foxes natural food wsource, leaving them with the only real option being your garden or livestock, what do you expect?",

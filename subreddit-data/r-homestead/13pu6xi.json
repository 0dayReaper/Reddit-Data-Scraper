    "postText": "I have a large pasture (1.5 acres) that I am wanting to open up to my goats a few months a year. Mostly over the winter. My fruit trees are small yet and am going to fence them off for now. Will I always have to keep them fenced off or in like 10 years can I take the fence down. Also will they destroy the already established trees? They should have plenty of other browse to chew on.",

Our goats have never had much problem chewing bark, but LOVE fresh leaves. I protect small trees with a ring of welded panel wire.  It comes 4' x 20' and that makes a good ring for a sapling.  Easy to expand to two panels when the tree gets bigger.  For Nigerians four feet will probably be high enough.  Just be sure to anchor it where the little guys can't push the wire ring around.",

They left them alone for years and then one discoved the bark is tasty.\n\nThey girdled 2 trees within a week and we had to protect the rest before they all died.",

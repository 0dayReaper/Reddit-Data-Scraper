    "postText": "What is the consensus on the cheapest way to get a large property fenced? 12 acres of woods with surrounding communities I don\u2019t want trespassing. The fence doesn\u2019t have to be crazy just a clearly delineated area with fencing and no trespassing signs. \n\nI\u2019m currently leaning toward welded wire with T posts as this seems like a relatively simple but tedious DIY. \n\nWhat about best place to buy? Right now I\u2019m leaning toward tractor supply. I am in NC.",

            "comment": "We used the trees for the high tensile fencing on our last 11 acre property. We used banded (should have been band and) insulators as it was an electric fence for animals. It did not damage the trees and lasted decades We had some wire damage here and there and had to restring a 300 foot section when a branch came down on it. But with the right tools, it was simple enough - me and my 92 yo grandfather did it in half a day.\n\nHere's an example of using trees with wire fencing: [https://fencefrenzy.com/heres-how-to-use-a-live-tree-as-a-fence-post/#:\\~:text=Using%20a%20live%20tree%20as,will%20become%20rigid%20and%20frail](https://fencefrenzy.com/heres-how-to-use-a-live-tree-as-a-fence-post/#:~:text=Using%20a%20live%20tree%20as,will%20become%20rigid%20and%20frail).\n\nOn another smaller property, I used landscape timbers instead of regular posts as they were cheaper than regular posts and T posts, coming in around $1.50 each - I'm sure they are more expensive now.\n\nETA: Fiberglass posts are another option and I've fenced animals with them. Easy to put into the ground and great for electric if needed. They have a bending strength you won't find with regular or T posts and pop back into place easily. Used to be fairly cheap but I'm sure costs have gone up.",

Close to what a landscape timber costs.\n\nAt my last place I ended up with fiberglass because T Posts were expensive then but their prices don't seem horrible now compared to the timber.\n\nThe fiberglass kept my behemoth draft cross contained and withstood a pony's attempt at freedom on a daily. They seriously bend nicely and can take a beating before breaking.\n\nFiberglass posts appear to be similar in costs as they were 10ish years ago. These are only 4 foot, but not too bad: [https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/sunguard-3-8-in-fiberglass-rod-post](https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/sunguard-3-8-in-fiberglass-rod-post)\n\nI used 6 foot fiberglass and a tool that slid over the top to pound into the ground a foot. Step-ins were not reliable for animals but could work for a boundary.",

Attach it to trees when convenient.  The mesh approach you're using is fine IF you were keeping something IN.  If all you want to do is keep Freddy OUT, 2 strands of barbed wire will do it, and will be cheap and easy to install and maintain.",

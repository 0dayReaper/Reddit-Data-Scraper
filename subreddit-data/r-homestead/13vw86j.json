If you get the Ball book, start at the beginning- it has the most beginner friendly and basic versions of salsa, tomato sauce and jellies right in the front for practice.\n\nAlways follow a tested recipe (not tested by your grandma), and follow it exactly.  Canning is not an art, it's a science, and there are reasons for all of the rules. Botulism is no fun for anyone.",

I went with an All American canner - it's an investment but has paid for itself many many times over and it's a pressure canner that doesn't need to be serviced every year which the presto pressure canners do need. Knowing myself I just got the All American that feels very safe to use and will last for literally ever",

            "comment": "We can tomatoes, grapes (for juice), and plums most years. Tomatoes are a staple food around here year-round. But the best ever was peaches. A buddy would head south to NJ each summer to sell stuff and bring back cases. We'd get two and can them. In Maine in the middle of winter, home canned peaches rule! All we needed for this was a water bath canner. We have a pressure canner but these foods are acidic enough for the water bath (after adding citric acid). You can get the USDA canning bible online now. [https://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/publications\\_usda.html#gsc.tab=0](https://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/publications_usda.html#gsc.tab=0)",

But you'd want warm/hot water to break up any deep stains, oils, etc.\n\nIt's just more energy efficient.  Means the Washer isn't going to waste the power to heat the water to whatever temps the other settings use.  It'll just fill from your water line and run a cycle at whatever temp that works out to.",

Monday rolls around and my body is destroyed. I've been taking about 1 ibuprofeen in the morning and one in the afternoon to keep going. \n\nIs this the homesteading dream I've been hearing about? My muscles are always hurting now, I am in great shape though...",

Some plates are about to fall, and may need a big push to complete, and we know we'll need recovery afterwards. Some are spinning away nicely, and don't need doing right now, but do need doing. And all the other priorities in between.\n\nApart from the urgent ones, the others are dealt with not so much \"in order\" but more \"I feel like digging today\", or \"My back hurts, so I'll do some pruning today\". \n\nAlso, I say to myself, \"If it's all perfect, what are you going to do next year?\" (yeah, I know there will be stuff, but I mean the big clear out stuff).\n\nThe local tradies know us as \"Go hard, after lunch\". We work about 4 hours a day. Give us a break, we're retirees!\n\nWe decide each day what is most urgent, or sometimes, when the body is hurting, we just do a few of the smaller jobs - as long as we do something.\n\nWe've also learned the seasons - winter is brush clearing and chainsawing, summer is mowing, weeding and just keeping the growth back to where we cleared last year. \n\nHaven't even had time for planting yet, or animals. I'll blame the house projects - needed an indoor toilet first, and a shed/outbuilding.",

It\u2019s a very fine line so I\u2019m always afraid I\u2019m going to overdo it and hurt myself.

It's ultimately about feeling what your body needs, stretching and the inevitable balance/strength training that goes along with some of the positions.\n\nIf you would like somewhere to start, check out Yoga with Adriene on youtube. Her style ultimately helped me make it a habit, now i have my own routine that i can do in as quick as 2 minutes those nights that i don't really feel like stretching. Still makes a world of difference in the morning.",

Remember to be kind and patient with yourself at first; you'll be using a variety of muscles in new ways, and that means surprising soreness sometimes. If you can think of it more with intrigue and curiosity than resentment, it can help get you through it quicker. \n\nEither way, consistency is most important, even if it means you watch the same video for weeks on end! It'll be different every day because your body will need something different every day. I hope your journey is wonderful!",

I have found just doing what my body feels like it needs, coupled with the core exercises makes it easier to get in a habit than going somewhere (not an option for many on a homestead) or following a video. The trick is just doing it every day. Noticing that your stride feels easier and the routine physical tasks actually feel GOOD at times will keep you in the habit. Or it has for me anyway.",

Sometimes I do the \"stretch\" ones, and humble myself. Or search like \"shoulders\" if I'm needing to focus on a particular area. She also has foundations videos that explain in detail how to do each variation of pose, those were super helpful to me in the beginning. The 30 days of series are excellent too, but I found some of them realllll challenging at the beginning, before I worked up my flexibility and balance and strength. So if you pick one that's especially difficult lol with advanced poses just stick with it!",

It\u2019s nice to know her rhythm so you can follow along with confidence. (Sometimes I\u2019ll sit and watch the more twisty movements and then rewind and follow along)",

If you are still wanting more, you can add this additional modification. Now, whatever version you are in, let's hold for five breaths.\"",

I played noseguard (1-AA, my final playing size was 6\u20192\u201d and about 290 lbs) and spent the first 20+ years of my life always eating as much as I could to try to gain more weight.  We had an EPIC strength and conditioning coach though (he held the world record in the squat for his weight class for awhile) so I was just massive overall.  \n\nIt took me almost 10 years after I stopped playing to figure out how to eat a \u201cnormal\u201d amount of food.  I was 275 for a couple years out of college, then about 235-240 for years as well.  Finally got down to about 210 pounds and have been pretty steady the last few years.  Even though a lot of it was muscle, it is mind-blowing how much EASIER AND LESS PAINFUL EVERY SINGLE THING I DO now without having to carry all that extra weight around\u2026 like I said though I have a lot of orthopedic issues that pop up and I can\u2019t really do much high intensity work for any extended period of time, but the little things like carrying large buckets / planters full of soil &amp; plants/trees around the property add up.  My wife and I also adopted a 3 year old 80 pound dog from a shelter a few months ago, and I HAVE to take him on a solid 2-3 hour hike at least 5 days a week or he annoys the hell out of his old chihuahua housemates trying to get them to play with him (they are old and can\u2019t really move well).  That extended low intensity walking/hiking almost every day is making a HUGE positive impact on MY life as well.  Only problems I\u2019ve had really are TEARING through shoes now, and I split/tore the ass out of 2 pairs of shorts and 1 pair of pants because I started getting a good amount of mass back in my legs/butt (which my wife is thrilled about). But the extra burned calories balance the added muscle so I\u2019m still about the same weight.",

Need to put a new roof on the house soon and I have no figured out how to get through that but we always manage.  Life is good!  Be well and best wishes to your family!",

If you\u2019re standing in front of a basketball rim and I told you do grab the rim by vertical jump  (whether you can or cannot actually touch the rim is irrelevant), you will naturally adjust your feet to a certain position seconds before you jump. That is your power position where you generate the most power. Your feet should be that far apart when swinging.\n\n**Hands**: If you\u2019re a right-hand swinger, hold the axe towards the bottom of the handle. While holding the axe stretch your arm out in front of you. The head of the axe should be resting on  whatever it is you intend to hit, with very little effort. If you have to stretch out to reach your target you are too far away, or short-arm yourself you are too close.\n\n\\*Edit: Forgot to mention another possibility is your axe is too short. \n\n**Swinging**: The weight of the axe is what should bring it  through a full circle. It\u2019s natural to muscle the axe as you swing it, but the axe should be light in your hands until the last moment before you strike the target. I always choose the heaviest sledge or axe for this reason, 12lbs or up.\n\n**Hands-2**:  If you\u2019re a right-hand swinger. Your left hand is always on the end of the axe. Your right hand is about half way up the handle towards the head. It is just for balance at this point. As you swing through the circle, your right hand is  barely  gripping the handle. At the last moment befor you strike the target your right hand slides down the handle like a hammer. If done properly both hands are at the end of the axe right as you hit the target.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's more but I don't really feel like turning this in to a performance enhancement lesson.",

My grandfather uses machines like they\u2019re all fluent body parts. There\u2019s a hydraulic lift on his log splitter, the kubota tractor or a fourwheeler and cart do much of the moving. He tries to stop himself from putting in more than 4 hours of productivity a day. Yet this small arthritic 82 y.o. man seems like a goddamn woods wizard to everyone else. He culled 120 huge old diseased beech trees last winter, alone. He dropped, cleaned up, chained and dragged the logs to the field and made small hills of beech blocks ready for splitting over the warm season. Some of these blocks are over 2\u2019 wide.\n\nI\u2019m going into the homesteading life as a crippled heavy laborer in my 30\u2019s and have to come up with all sorts of creative ways to keep things physically efficient and simple. I used to dig out oak stumps with a shovel and axe for fun.  But to answer your question yes, I think most folks who have done many years of hard manual labor deal with varying amounts of chronic pain.\n\nHope you set things up matters quite a bit.",

I'm overactive and always been a \"good worker\" so taking breaks is tough for me.  Even when I say I need one, I'll usually sit down for 60 seconds and then see something that needs doing and hop up \"just to handle that one thing before I take a proper break\" and that just keeps happening all day.  So sometimes I'll make myself sit down for 3 songs on a playlist.  Or until I finish a whole drink/whole joint/whole youtube video.  Or I'll put a pet in my lap so I have to think about displacing them before I get up again.  It's tough but it really does help me to take breaks.

    "postText": "We have about 45 chickens and they net a profit of about 2k a year while also providing us with choice protein. That being said I don\u2019t like being dependent on these crazy high corn prices dictating my feed cost. So long story short I started maggot farming a month ago. It definitely is easier and less disgusting than I thought it would be. I did two types of systems that had some slight variations and am going to build a third that uses the best parts of the first two \u201cpractice runs\u201d. So far each 5 gallon bucket system has been creating enough food source for 4-5 chickens a day and I think I can increase that to 8-10 with a few minor changes. And then hang all 4-5 systems required to sustain the flock in the back of the barn, downwind from the house. The end goal is that I can shave 50% of our feed cost annually. \n\nDoes anyone who has done maggot farming have any tips or tricks? TIA",

We've had good results after just a couple of weeks. We didn't purchase any larvae though, the soldier flies just kind of showed up after a couple of days and did their thing. It's a lot less gross than I thought it would be since the larvae fall into the bucket on their own and you can just dump it out for the chickens without having to ever touch them",

If you are talking meal worm then you would be using flour of some sort which really doesn't help with the cost. Worms on the other hand just need organic plant matter which can be collected on the property, stuff that you can't eat, is free, does not require flour if I recall.\n\nBut if you are using waste chicken parts then maggots make sense.",

The Northeast tribes did have a healthier social and political structure than the Europeans of the time did (our own government has acknowledged that it has drawn inspiration from the Iroquois Confederacy), and they lived sustainably with the land, but ultimately they're just people who lived their lives like anywhere else.",

The big thing about clay is that it's non-permeable: water can't drain through it effectively. So instead of other soil types where rainwater will filter down into the groundwater system, water will hit the clay level and then just slide around until it finds something that isn't clay (which in NC pretty much just means it'll keep going until it finds a river).\n\nBeaver Dam on an all-clay property could cause excessive flooding problems easier than other kinds of dirt, if the water has nowhere else to go.\n\nDepending on the area, it could also mean the clay property is considered a wetland under the federal EPA rules, which doesn't mean much for regular folks but if you want to start digging through the clay you need approval from the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nEdit: the other important thing about clay is that it is an absolute bitch to dig through, which is probably what the OP was referring to.\n\nAnd to answer your question about soil health, clay itself is generally low in nutrients and difficult for roots to penetrate, but that's only really going to affect foreign plants that rely on deep root systems, like Great Plains grasses. Plants local to your area will do fine on top of clay, they'll likely be shallow-root plants that can either deal with the clay or won't have roots deep enough to reach it anyway. Especially nutrient-hungry plants may need extra fertilizer.",

In some places they have to drive out hours and hours for an acceptable place to release them, and some people just don't have places they can release them at all. Catching them live humanely is a lot more work than killing them, but there might be someone in your area who does both. It would all depend on the regulations for this in your area.",

They deepen ponds by excavating the bottoms to give themselves easy access to different parts of the pond. They even sometimes connect nearby streams by building canals that help them get access to resources without leaving the water. They expand and preserve wetlands, which attracts other wildlife. They reduce many invasive species and slow erosion. They create more habitat for fish, which increases the quality of the water and the ecosystem.   \n\n\nYou'll have to protect any trees you want to keep for food or whatever, and they'll probably outsmart you a couple times with that, but if you're okay with the pond getting a bit larger you should see some really amazing improvements to your land. If you want a book recommendation, I just finished reading Once They Were Hats by Frances Backhouse. Incredibly interesting stuff.",

We are the ones who destroyed things, they're just returning them to the way they should be for the health of the ecosystem. Obviously not everything can be moved out of their way, but we should definitely be trying to accommodate the beaver's return rather than eliminating them where they're inconvenient as a matter of policy. You're just the tool the policymakers are using to implement their policy and you're not doing anything illegal, but the policy itself is frequently wrongheaded and usually uninformed. We shouldn't be building or farming on what should be wetlands, but government is set up to protect business interests and human property and therefore will usually not do what is ultimately best for humanity or the planet.  \nThat being said, I'm all for sustainable trapping and fur use. We just need to figure out what sustainable means in each ecosystem and align policy with it. It's all really complicated, and I definitely don't have many good answers for it.",

Hope this guy has an excavator just lying around somewhere lol. These greasy little bastards are fixing to fuck his shit up. He has no idea.",

They watched it for a while and the beaver finally turned around and spotted them. It stood up on it's hind legs and started chattering it's teeth extremely fast and loud. That scared them enough to slowly back away. All he could think of is how that thing could easily gnaw his leg off if it wanted.",

The land managers realized that the most cost-effective way to restore wetlands, eradicate non-native prairie grasses, and regrow riparian willow was reintroduction of beavers. They can engineer the landscape in ways that, were we to conduct the construction, would require heavy machinery and permitting. Beavers do it for free. So we\u2019re building BDAs (beaver dam analogues) aka PALS (post-assissted log structures) aka SBSs (synthetic beaver structures) to encourage beaver populations.\n\nThe elk that were reintroduced to the valley after extirpation don\u2019t have the historic migration patterns of the 1920s elk, so fenced enclosures to promote willow regrowth are also under construction, because even with controlled canine events to scatter the elk, the moose quickly move in to browse on the willows.\n\nThe benefits of this project include fire resilience and water quality improvements in the highest-elevation watershed in the Colorado River watershed.",

Every single one of them now has a deep seeded hatred of beavers. One even lost their home because what was their front yard got declared a wetland due to beaver flooding and they were literally disallowed to do any work on their property including mitigating water damage to their home. \n\nCurrently the hot topic in my town of 1200 is how to deal with the beavers that are wreaking havoc on our local pond and the surrounding streams. Some folks have had the water level rise over 10 horizontal feet up their property - to the point where we all know that their house will be under water come spring snow melt. The debate is whether it is the towns responsibility or the homeowners responsibility to deal with the beavers. Next week our states beaver mitigation expert is coming out to consult on the issue. \n\nGood luck lol.",

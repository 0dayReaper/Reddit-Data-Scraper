I work in animal/wildlife control and about two years ago, a coworker of mine was tasked with removing a kestrel that was trapped in a barn loft. He (coworker) picked it up exactly like how you did in the photo to show the homeowner. The bird panicked, clenched it's feet causing one of its talons to pierce the palm of his hand, and tried to fly away. It's talon had hooked into a tendon in my coworkers hand and it was being pulled out like a rubber band. He now has permanent mobility issues with the ring finger of his left hand.\n\nRaptors are amazing birds, but they can be feisty and unpredictable. They can also pose much more danger than their size may tell.\n\nedited: added warning for those with vivid imaginations",

Those talons are shockingly sharp and their feet much stronger than you expect.  \n\nWhen holding raptors, force their feet together (into a steep X) and you hold their legs above their feet. Then use your arm and other hand to support their body weight and restrain motion.\n\nIf panicked, they are much more likely to defend themselves with feet than with their beak.",

They rarely harm humans intentionally but they are very dangerous. Accidents happen, like the mistaken identity here, but if you see a raptor in need, try to call in to a local group for advice. \n\nAnd as extra caution? There are other (very rare!) fatal tragic accidents*. The barred owl is implicated in at least one human death due to clawing at a woman\u2019s scalp. The talons can hit some major arteries and veins, if they hit just right. It\u2019s a bit like handling knives: Don\u2019t unless you\u2019re doing it safely. \n*Especially true for the largest like a few eagles that prey on monkeys.

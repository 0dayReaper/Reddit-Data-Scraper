Central Oregon and completely off grid, no well, so I am growing a lot of drought tolerant varities of high-calorie staple crops.\n\nIn the foreground I have a couple of varieties of potatoes going, the Yukon Golds from my local seed co-op and another early variety, Modoc.\nBehind I have a couple rows of onions and some sunchoke beds and behind me are my corn rows and bean gardens. I have a couple strains of tepary beans at the moment, both high altitude/low water varities that have recently been spouting.\n\nHappy farming all!! Be Easy!",

A lot of parasites can get inside of you through your feet, they are tiny and can get in tiny cuts, which you\u2019re more likely to have from walking without protection. Nowhere did I say that you were dirty honey. I had worms twice as a kid, once from being barefoot and once from improperly stored/cooked food (my mom is a hoarder and we lived in poverty/no electricity). Look up hookworms if you get a chance. \n\nI promise, cleanliness isn\u2019t usually the issue. It can happen to anyone with exposed skin touching the ground, especially if it\u2019s in an area where feces are. Areas like a garden where animals come to feed, and then they poop, and then the rain washes down that poop so you can\u2019t tell it was there (but the parasites still are). A lot of people get lucky and never experience it, even if they are doing higher risk behaviors. I hope that you\u2019re one of them! I just thought I would share the info, because it really is horrific to have to go around feeling worms come out of your butt lol.",

It was a big problem in the South until the 1910s when there was a big education effort to convince poor southerners and kids not to go barefoot in soil all the time.\n\nYou don't need to get defensive. It isn't about hygiene; worms burrow through clean flesh touching soil as easily as dirty flesh. Yes, there is a reason health educators don't encourage extended barefoot time in soil. You don't have to dirty socks, get a nice plastic/rubber pair of close-toed sandals to work in if you want. But you're very much raising your chances of hookworms working barefoot or even naked outside.\n\nA big part of homesteading is developing skills and making simple smart decisions that lead to self-sufficiency. Wearing protective clothing is one of those simple decisions. Getting sick and having to go to the doctor for antiparasitic drugs is not self-sufficent.",

We are essentially putting poison into our bodies, and our animals bodies\u2026. So it\u2019s good to do it sparingly, only when necessary. The thought of having parasites used to really freak me out, until I learned that we all are covered in mites all the time. There just needs to be a balance.",

We tried a bunch of varieties and I really wanted them to work well... but this year we decided to give them a pass based on the space efficiency.\n\nI've had really good luck with Borlotti pole beans and several kinds of white pole beans (I think they're mostly Alaric (Tarbais) Dry Pole Bean - but we have like 5 kinds mixed in genetically at this point.. so could be any of them) especially when planted later in the year.  The baker creek \"https://www.rareseeds.com/bean-cherokee-trail-of-tears\" did really well partnered with taller flour corn (I'm on like yeah 5 or so of developing a landrace that does well here).  The lofthouse derived Landrace cowpea did super well as did his Speedy Dry Bean Grex also sold as \"lofthouse fastest\".   I've been working on seed saving a mix of soy bean for edemame that \"makes it\" although we've had better yields from the chickpeas (which when picked still green but full make a fantastic edemame replacement).  If you haven't tried Bell Beans as an early planter in your high desert area you're missing out on a fantastic crop (I bought them as a cover crop but found they were also super tasty hah.  I can plant them a bit before last frost and they yield a month earlier than most of our other beans as a green bean, and are pretty decent dry as well).",

We also had great luck with \"Flour Corn, Mandan Parching Lavender\" from adaptive seeds, it's a super short season and really rugged corn, it's to short and spindly for co-planting beans with (we tried it one year and the beans just CRUSHED the corn, although it still somehow produced reasonably well under the mat.. pretty amazing).  I think if i had to pick one high desert corn I'd play around with a couple of the Mandan which are mostly (I think..) from North Dakota so works super well with short seasons and fairly cool nights.  I sort of figure that we just keep planting the plants that produced and mix in a few things that seemed to work before every so often to keep genetic diversity high enough.. and it mostly works lol.\n\nI've wanted to try lentils, I think they're another fairly low yield plant but look super fun if I had enough space to put enough out to be interesting.\n\nWe've had pretty good luck with several kinds of cowpeas (not all, the italian was a bust and a few others were really low yield but more northern types do ok it seems) but the toughest ones for a green bean like bean are the Thai Soldier Beans (rareseeds), they aren't huge maybe 10\"+- so closer to a \"regular\" green bean than a long bean, not great for drying or boiling but work swimmingly in stir fries and the like.  They produce faster, longer and later than almost any of our other similar things (except the bell beans are way earlier..), but they do really well hot, dry, moderately cool, damp.. just keep chugging.\n\nRye *should* do ok where you are, maybe it got a bit to hot &amp; dry in the days?  I last grew it quite a bit further north and it liked cooler weather but yeah... I dunno.  Maybe try really early spring or early fall planting?  The grain I've been having the best luck with has been \"Barley, Purple Valley\" (from adaptiveseeds) which grew pretty well (liked a bit of nitrogen added) and was SUPER easy to hand thresh and winnow (I just rolled it with some boards and bucket-&gt;bucket winnowed it), made some tasty beef &amp; barley &amp; veggie stews as well!   We're trying a short season hulless wheat from experimental farm network this year as well which is looking \"ok\" (it's maybe not in the best location), the triticale I tried on the other hand.. IDK.. I think I planted it to early and it rotted out or something almost none came up!\n\nSoy beans have been super hit and miss for us, mostly miss.  The chickpeas generally did better.  I could see the jays 100% doing that, one year their cousin magpies stole ALL of my corn seed (in retrospect they were sitting in the trees watching... should've known).  I've had to cover some stuff with wire mesh until it comes up.",

I kind of suspect they might like flood and dry as that would be closer to monsoon rain type growing in AZ.  I'd certainly be interested to know what works if someone has had good success :)",

The others I flood irrigated every couple weeks just enough to keep alive did *slightly* better.  Maybe I didn't get them wet enough to start, or our soil is just to heavy for them to get sufficient root structure (the soil there was *really* bad).  I had kind of imagined they might do ok with heavier soil what with the caliche, but if they grow more in sandy draws naturally, maybe not so much. \n\nI'll have to try them again in a less crappy place with your watering schedule and see what they do.  Thanks for the advice!",

I started using it to identify plants I already know just to get my numbers up.\n\nI'm lucky to live in one of the most ecologically diverse places in the US, in southern Appalachia. I've identified 100 different plants on my half acre property alone. But it's almost all woods with no real lawn to speak of. The small \"lawn\" area alone has around 30 different species. I hit it with the string trimmer every once in a while but I can't imagine replacing it with sod or something. I love my \"weeds\".",

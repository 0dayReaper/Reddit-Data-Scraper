I don\u2019t have a lot of desires other than to live simply spend time in nature and follow my religion, so to me it seems like the homestead life is perfect. However I have no clue what to do for income in that lifestyle. Surly farmer (while it\u2019s a job I\u2019d gladly take) isn\u2019t the only job available for the homestead.",

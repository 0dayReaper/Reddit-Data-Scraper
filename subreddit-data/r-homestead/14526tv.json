Basically you plug batteries into one side and panels into the other and you're good to go.\n\nBut it's such new tech that I would really watch each review of each brand before you buy.  He really takes them apart and points out strengths and weaknesses.",

Solar and wind are good but both are intermittent.  Solar with batteries can be a good option, they're just expensive. Consider life span of batteries and especial installation demands for best performance (humidity and winter weathers), if your plan to buy... make good decisions.",

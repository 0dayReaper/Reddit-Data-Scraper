We lost her sister at a young age so we've become her herd.  I think if you want grass mowing capabilities, must have at least 2 goats.  If you just want comical troubles, 1 will do it.  Ours has apparently learned how to open the outside fridge.  She ate the cupcake box and left cupcakes all over the deck and then ate the labels off the beer bottles.  Good times.  And oh yes, she does love to stand on the cars for no particular reason other than to scan the horizon looking for her next ramming victim..",

It specifies no more than 5'x5'x5' which is silly.  I can see limiting it to 125 ft^3 but the 5x5x5 means you can't build a coop you can stand in or you can build a low wide one with more square footage per bird.",

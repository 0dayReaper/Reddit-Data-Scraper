The gravel allows good drainage so it doesn't get muddy and the straw can be easily forked out and composted before it breaks down too much.\n\nSince you have CC and likely won't have them out there for more than 8-10 weeks at a time, you could probably do anything and then just due a couples deep cleans. Be forewarned, though, their shit really stinks. I have no problem with animal waste usually but there's something about the CC that gets me.",

But you\u2019re right, you\u2019ll have to clean it regularly to keep it healthy. \n\nI\u2019m hoping someone on here has a better suggestion than sand or mulch.",

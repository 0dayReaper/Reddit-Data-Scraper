            "comment": "Thanks for checking out the post! Hope you enjoy some of the pictures and a little about our journey.\r  \n\r  \nSome background: \r  \n\r  \nThis property was a family farm from 1860ish to 1960ish. The children of the second farmer all went away to college and had successful lives in various other disciplines. The aunt of the family lived and took care of the property (as best she could) until 2000. It has been almost entirely vacant for 20 years. Surprisingly the buildings were not in terrible shape and the out of state inheritors were very motivated to keep the main structures from failing. \r  \n\r  \nThey were all damaged in some way and needed attention to prevent more rapid decay. We came about this property in serendipitous fashion and just happen to have the right combination of skills, vision and plan for the owners to take a chance on transitioning the property.\r  \n\r  \nI was almost done with a formalized apprenticeship pre-pandemic and happened to meet the owner at a conference. He was specifically looking for a (relatively) young farmer who was up to the task of restoring the property and preserving the legacy of the family farm because so many have been lost to development or other conversions. They really cared about stewardship since the farm has a major tributary of the Susquehanna river running right through it and wanted someone that could farm it \u201corganically\u201d. \r  \n\r  \nHe told me that he approached over 5000 people in five years and was just about to give up and put it on auction when we crossed paths. Apparently I was the only person who said yes to such an enormous project and had the background he was looking for.. To be fair the pool of young people with formalized ag training is really small and most people only want a few acres to manage. This property is 130 acres with tons of challenges. \r  \n\r  \nWe spent a year coming up with all types of plans to transition the property in an equitable way because they knew the challenges that came with it and the economic realities of farming in this era. I had a fairly robust business plan and vision for the land and farm so that gave the owners confidence in the transition.  \r  \n\r  \nThen the pandemic happened and accelerated our transition plan because of all the uncertainty. To our surprise the majority owner asked us to purchase the property outright and that the price would only reflect his siblings shares of the farm since he just wanted it to be preserved and the legacy of the farm continued. \r  \n\r  \nThis was a major shock and of course we said yes. We had already been living at the property doing some preliminary work but it was not something we expected. There is a stipulation in our contract that we cannot sell the property except back to the previous owners within the first five years.\r  \n\r  \nFirst year:\r  \n\r  \nGot the greenhouse up, fields defined and our cover crop in before fall and worked a bit on the house because a surprise baby was on the way. Cleaned out structures because all of them had tons of junk (and a little treasure) in them. Sold our first vegetables at both market and through our CSA. \r  \n\r  \nWe also cleaned up the old apple orchard which was completely overgrown and could barely walk through. Unfortunately no apple trees were producing or worth saving.\r  \n\r  \nSecond year\r  \n\r  \nThe barnyard was completely transformed and revitalized through lots of hard work. I cut the old hog pen off the pole shed and pulled it over with the tractor. I used the old horse drawn wagon to pick it up piece by piece and take it to the burn pile.. We saved a ton of wood and re-sided some of the other barns with the good stuff. \r  \n\r  \nRan our second season of CSA and started a market on the property in the barnyard. We hosted events and even ran a \u201cmajor\u201d camping retreat in the fall with over 20 people staying for six days. \r  \n\r  \nWe also started a forestry inventory and initial plan for some light timber harvesting to open the back half of the property up again and restore the roads etc that are inaccessible at the moment.\r  \n\r  \nThird year:\r  \n\r  \nWe are expanding our CSA, documenting more of our progress, shrinking our market to a more manageable schedule and continuing to bring people onto the land to share the beauty and food we produce. \r  \n\r  \nOur whole vision revolves around bringing people back into the space so we focused on cleaning it all up, and making it safe for people to come onto the property. It has been quite the journey so far but we are excited about the progress and curious how it will unfold!\r  \n\r  \nLet me know if you have any questions about the farm or renovating a property like this.",

I could barely afford to live while doing it to be honest because I was by myself.. that was also the reason I did it!\n\nSome, or most of my peers either lived at home with parents or had a spouse working full time that could support the learner.\n\nI hope things change but the ag industry and especially the small farm have really thin margins. Labor is the biggest cost on these farms and why I designed mine so everything could be done with 1.5 people. Me and sometimes my wife - when we are both out there we cruise and crush it but if you get to big and need 5+ employees it eats into everything since people can't rely on migrant labor anymore and have to pay them $14 an hour or so.\n\nYou should definitely explore it.. maybe go to the PASA conference.. it is coming up really soon and see if there are farms in your area hiring.\n\nI don't want to be discouraging but the whole food system is really screwed up right now. \n\nAnother option, we are going to be documenting this whole season (on YouTube) because I saw how unrealistic getting this knowledge was.. so we are going to do our best to communicate what I learned and how to be successful with direct-market farming on the homestead scale.\n\nIf you have any more questions let me know.",

This is nearly exactly how we want to restore our farm but we have zero ag training outside of my experience working on a horse ranch for years and helping with other live stock as needed. \n\nWe are currently restoring the house we can live in it while we restore the barns, and property. Luckily the fields are okay and only need work at the edges since they were leased, but nothing else has been touched in 30 years!\n\nVery inspiring post to see! Thanks for sharing!",

Very similar to what we have.. what state or country are you in? \n\n\nWe actually have an ebook that might be helpful when considering direct market farming. It focuses on vegetables but the principles can be useful for any farming system.\n\nIt has a lot of examples from farms I visited and worked on and very useful things like crop plans, field plans and organizational systems and operational strategies to improve efficiency.\n\n\nHere is a link with some examples pages and the table of contents:\n\nhttps://www.thefarmatcatawissacreek.com/shop/p/direct-market-farming-for-the-homestead\n\nIf you have any questions let me know!",

We are going to set our focus on ag tourism with some farm stay cabins but also want to small scale sell produce and eggs, as well as beef and possibly lamb if we feel like getting more complicated. We both work full time, but would like to drop to part time to run the business from home. \n\nI'm sure once we get into the projects I'll be posting lots of questions on here. Restoring the barns will be interesting for sure! \n\nI'm a planner so pre-planning the farm layout has been top of mind and so difficult!\n\nWe are near Ottawa, Ontario (canada)\n\nOur farm is 92 acres, the farm steps downward so it's actually split into 3 \"levels\" with steep banks between each level, and a couple ravines with creeks taking water down to the ottawa River!",

Have you heard of keyline design? There are some very helpful videos out there that help manage water on slopes like that and to keep it on your property and accessible for animals or vegetables.",

I know we won't be tile draining, it's too expensive for what our goals are with the property. For now we've continued to lease to the farmer who's been using it for thr past 10 years. \n\nThe upper fields are crop, corn, wheat or soy. The farmer reports that they are good, there's a couple spots they go around either due to rock or wetness but not a significant amount. We haven't been through a spring yet so we shall see! \n\nThe bottom fields are hay fields, and the middle is old fields that have grown over into small meadows. I think that's where we will see the most water issues. \n\nMost.of it drains right into the back of the driveshed attached to the house! Not ideal! We have predug some ditches to get it flowing away from the house outnto the road. The foundation on the driveshed has been completely washed out over the years. \n\nThanks so much for the info!

Most farm buildings have a thatched straw roof, mud or concrete flooring, and mostly loose housing systems. My both parents grew up as farmers, I was introduced to farming when I was very young. Now the dramatic urbanization has made it really hard for the people here to expand their farms and maintain this profession. With imposed taxes in the government occupied lands and forests, expansion of farms has been difficult for the farmers. This is one of the major factor behind the decline of traditional farming. \n\nIt's good to see someone working hard trying to rebuild a unused farmstead, especially for someone like me; who's coming from a small village and wants to do something similar. Your post is truly inspiring.",

We have a few friends from India who still own farm land but cannot really imagine farming or what to do with it because of the problems you explained.\n\nI saw a very interesting project called the kheyti greenhouse in a box.. it is a start up in India that is providing low cost greenhouse kits for farmers in India.. have you heard of this? Do you think it will be useful? \n\nVery glad to connect so far away.. looking forward to staying in contact",

Might be interesting to watch some of that. We should be uploading more this week. \n\nGood luck with everything and hope to see your vision manifest!",

Can I just let them hatch these eggs in their own? \n\nDo I need to worry about them getting enough food and water? \n\nThose are guinea eggs by the way.  I take the duck eggs and they are not fertilized.",

            "comment": "So if I understand this correctly, your ducks are sitting on fertile Guinea hen eggs?  If so, you could let them try to hatch the eggs, but I wouldn\u2019t allow the ducks to raise the chicks after they hatch. You don\u2019t want Guinea fowl chicks drowning trying to follow their duck \u201cmom\u201d into the water. If a good hatch rate is important to you I\u2019d take the eggs away and put them in an incubator. If it\u2019s not important and more just for fun/extra/experimentation, go for it, just be prepared to put the chicks in a brooder as soon as they hatch.",

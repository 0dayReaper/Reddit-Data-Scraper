I'm not an expert, but from my understanding the semi-dwarfing and dwarfing rootstocks bloom quickly but larger and full size trees tend to take longer. All of our trees are semi-dwarfing and this is our second year for a full bloom, first year for a big crop. Hopefully yours aren't too far behind!",

And so sorry to hear about your cherry tree. \ud83d\ude15 I know they are susceptible to brown rot, we lost a few that way too.\n\nIt took a long time for us to get here (5 years of failing), and we really only started having success once we started following our state's agricultural program recommendations (4-5 years to get to this harvest). So almost a decade! I think just about every state here in the US has an agricultural program, and if you're outside the US, perhaps you can check the local universities in your country? In the US it should be free, btw...we do ours through Virginia Tech. We're on an email list and they send out maintenance schedules for treatments, pest predictions, frost warnings, etc...They also have webinars and occasional live in-person events - all free! Really, it's made all the difference.\n\nI wish you lots of success if you decide to try again! \ud83c\udf52",

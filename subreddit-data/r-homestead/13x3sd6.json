Because a packet of carrot seeds is usually so small I expected the yield to be small, as though it were difficult to get much carrot seed. \n\nWhen I harvested some carrot seed I was surprised to get it by the handful, and happy to have enough to toss liberally around rather than carefully cultivating rows with the precious seed and having to attend to their every finicky need to get successful germination.",

If you have more of the tap root it seems to grow better, but it isn't a requirement.\n\nI've gotten many flowers from store bought carrot tops that had only a nub left of the stalk - in this instance I've found it helps to leave the carrot top on a dampened paper towel and within a week or so you'll see leaves start to regrow, then you can plant it into the ground. It makes sense in the context of wild carrot, which is mostly flowers and leaves and very little taproot.\n\nCarrots are biennial, in their first year they grow the tap root, and in their second year they flower and make seeds. \n\nFlowering takes up a bit of space, the flowers grow about a metre tall on thin stalks topped by big white umbrella shaped flowers. Eventually they flop all over the place. Good ludy bugs and wasps love to crawl all over them. Somewhere I've got a photo of this and I wish I had it to show you now. It's worth growing carrots for this reason alone, I think. \n\nCarrots are almost all self-pollinating, so you should get plenty of seeds even if you only get one carrot to flower. You can easily harvest seed by tying a paper bag loosely over a drying flower, or leave it where it grew and get self-seeded carrots. \n\nCarrot belongs to the plant family Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) which includes many toxic plants and they can hybridise, so there is a risk your seeds might not be 100% edible carrot and the next generation of carrots might be affected. I don't know the likelihood. The usual advice I've read is that carrot leaves and seeds are edible - there are commercial carrot seed oil farms. When I had lots of growing space in the past I let carrots flower and self-seed.\n\nI do not like eating carrot flowers in their 'naked' form - for me they're not a salad flower as their texture is wrong - however I think they might hold up well to a tempura like treatment much as you might do for zucchini flowers? I'm personally a bit wary of carrot flowers and leaves as they seem to irritate my sensitive skin a bit and that plant family has many phytotoxic plants known to cause contact dermatitis. Your mileage may vary so be sure to check out the info on your particular plants and varieties.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk on carrot flowers. If only I was as successful at growing the actual carrot root vegetable part of the plant!\n\nETA: I think you could also just dig into the soil from the side to harvest a carrot and cut it off from the top and leave the top relatively undistributed to continue growing, or leave a few carrots unharvested to let them go to flower and seed.",

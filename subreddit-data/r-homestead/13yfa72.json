I can\u2019t take a Politician seriously who pretends to care for the environment while knowing how much of the environment they are destroying in the process, while using child slaves. In my country, people are kidnapped for their organs and people in the west who need transplants think that some kind hearted fellow happily donate them. Our world is very dark and I think what people should be doing is not buy everything new, repair broken appliances, produce their own food, soap, etc. I despise communism but I also despise over consumption. It\u2019s destroying humanity",

Panels already in use cannot be un-made; you can't put back the cobalt and give a kid their childhood back. Once a panel has been purchased by someone else, the only question for it is whether it continues to offset fossil fuels or goes off to be toxic garbage in a landfill.\n\nFor solar cooking and water heating, all you need is a reflector and a bunch of dark-colored pipe, respectively. Those can be DIY'd from slavery-free materials.",

                            "comment": "Uhm. Because what the hell is 98% sustainable???? Just be happy have a garden and that it gives you food. This bragging on how sustainable they are is kind of off putting to a lot of people. \n\nIt contains garden veggies. And they state they have some fruit. That garden is NOT big enough to provide 98% of the food for one person for 1 full year. It also is the type of garden that requires a lot of outside inputs. Both make it not truly sustainable to a lot of people that are into that.  \n\nIt is a great garden, but the claim to that level of sustainable is unfounded and what turns people off. There are people who are growing that level of food and they work their asses off. It is not JUST a garden that gets you to 98% sustainable. \n\nMaking the claim with a picture of only a small garden that they are 98% sustainable will piss off the people because for many of them it belittles what they do. Like simple stuff. \n\nTomato sauce. Ball basic recipe is 45 pounds of tomatoes for 7 quarts. A year of tomato sauce might be one quart a week or 52 quarts. So lets say 8 batches (56) for a year's spaghetti and chili and whatever else. That is 360 pounds of tomatoes. Plus salsa, plus any stewing tomatoes, plus the ones you eat fresh.  So do they the 400+ pounds of tomatoes out of this they would need for a year. \n\nWhat about the garden itself. Looks like nicely framed raised beds and fences made from store bought lumber. Is that not pressure treated boards? If so they will need new ones every couple of years. Where are the trees they have set aside for that work? Or are they pressure treated? Then that also is not very sustainable is it? Where the gravel come from? Do they have their own gravel pit? How or where do they get the stuff to make repairs to their beds and fencing? Where are seeds from? Are they saving seed or buying? Do they fertilize? Do they use any form of pesticides? Where are the staple crops? Potatoes or grains???\n\nIt triggers people becasue they actually know that A. A single picture is NOT proof of sustainability and B. There are 50 million definitions of what that means, but making a claim that high is absurd to most of the people trying to actually do it. \n\nIt is like the dude that shows up to a motorcycle custom show who bought a Harley, ordered an aftermarket tank and had it painted and put some mail order chrome mirrors and foot pegs on it and tells everyone it is \"98% custom\". No one believes him and most people will give him shit about it. But the same bike just sitting there, with no claims made, would be admired and he would get compliments. A lot of the people on here are hard core about this stuff. They are the Arlen Nesses of sustainable homesteading so really don't like it. \n\nJust show off your nice garden and don't make BS claims you can't back up. And if you are going to make claims like that, have more to the post than just a picture of small garden to back up your claims. I have a guy at work that likes to claim \"he grows almost all his own food\" What he means is that during the summer most of the vegetables they eat come out of his garden and they eat a lot of salads. He does not can, dry, or otherwise preserve his vegetables. He does not raise livestock or keep chickens, he does not grow grains or any form of staple and eats dinner at restaurants at least 3 or 4 nights a week. He gets lambasted by people that don't even have gardens for claiming he \"grows almost of of his own food\". It is pretentious and unfounded. \n\nAlso super wholesome? This is the internet. You are asking for an echo chamber. You go on the internet, it's not your mom, you grandma, or any of your friends. No one here has any reason to cajole or coddle you. No one has any reason to let things slide that they disagree with. The VERY CONCEPT is wrong that somehow people owe you support and agreement. That is not an open forum. AN open forum means you get the bad and the good. Make capricious claims, get called out. Be a racist, get called out. The world is not there to affirm your life and tell you how great you are. Don't expect a trophy for every thing you post. And nothing gets better when everyone says it is great. Things get better when people tell other people what could be done better or correct their conceptual errors. \n\nLong story, you don't want the sustainability freaks to blast your sustainability claims? Make them accurate and with evidence or don't make them.  Just like anything, there are people that take that shit personally and it *IS THEIR LIFE*.",

We have other large gardens not to mention meat (we could live on wild deer and turkey out here) and wild things growing on property. We have a large network of farms in the area and a large percentage are Amish. I will admit I would not be near as close to our goal without them. I also have several months of food already stored from what we have already gotten and some prepped items from the store. The 98% goal is the amount of money we are putting out vs putting away from our monthly paychecks. Right now we stand at 87%. We HOPE to be at 98% by the end of the year. I also have done huge amounts of research and not working for over two years to accomplish this. Also please note that I never wrote SELF sustainable. We are building a sustainable community around us and that was ALWAYS the goal. Its taken a lot of work and networking, my husband laughs and calls me an \"extreme people person\".",

I always wanted a homestead so when the opportunity presented itself in may of last year, I jumped on it. We moved here in October so from May to October all I did was research properties and growing methods especially region specific ones. Livestock sustainability etc. Its all I did for months because I wasnt working and we are military so they handle the move. Then in October its past the growing season so I studied some more. And then I hooked up with a local \"plant guy\" ya know the kind whose backyard looks like its from a storybook? Yeah him. And we geeked out some more and actually started drawing up plans. Designating planting spots, then figuring out what soil works best with which plants. Figuring out natural pest control methods, and using the animals and tools around us. Then we got a warm spell and covid happened at the same time and we decided what was supposed to be a 6 month project, was now going to be a main focus as he was furloughed from his day job. So we broke ground. We dug it out by hand both the 60 x 60 space you see here and 20x20 thats to the left. These beds are dug 5-6 ft deep, the bottom is lined with weedblock and the gravel you see in between. Then they each have a soil for their needs. Some is mushroom composted. Some is high nitrogen. Some is regular old bed soil because thats what they thrive in. We started inside, my front porch is glass lined but isnt sealed so it gets like a greenhouse in there and they all just shot up. We transferred outside and we transplanted and we lost a bit but it turns out I planted too many anyway so it was ok. Hes still laid off work so hes been babying them. I make sure he leaves weeding for me though cuz I enjoy it.",

I'm not trying to be a dick, and its still and excellent garden with tons of potential, I would just hate for the season to get too late before you could make other plans in case you are depending on these crops for reals.  Deep south homestead has a few videos on youtube about the math behind actually growing a years worth of food, (though there methods are a bit old school), but man, its a lot of food you need to make a year. It is definitely 1000% a huge leap in the right direction towards sustainability.",

I think you are severely underusing your land to make that sort of claim. Ive read of people supporting a family of 6 on 3500 sq ft. An acre for a family of 4 seems overkill.",

Trying to convince the hubby to do a smaller version of this in the future (currently live with my parents, don't have full fledged careers going, need grad school) but he wants to live in the city. And where we are considering putting roots down in the future has a HUGE growing season.  Bit planning on the livestock for meat, but definitely for eggs, milk and cheese. Solar is the plans as well. The one minor upside to COVID is it helps me make my case to have land and grow our own food, and have space!\n\nWas just wondering where you did you research for everything and how you made your plans? We're years away, but if it ever happens, I like to know stuff and plan in advance. Thanks for any help and tips you can give.  We even considered finding friends to share this all with.",

No garden area. Pasture fence and clothes lines removed. \n\nTo top it all off, the house was beautifully designed to stay cool in summer.

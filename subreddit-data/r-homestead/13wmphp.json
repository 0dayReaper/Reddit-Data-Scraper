Only a small fraction of people are brave enough to go against the grain and actually speak up and say the truth and what 90% of people are already thinking, and it leads to the intransigent 10% getting their way.  If more people stood up and spoke truth when they see others telling lies, our society would be in a much healthier place right now.

Try to keep it hydrated, dip its beak in a little electrolyte water a few times several times a day.  God luck.",

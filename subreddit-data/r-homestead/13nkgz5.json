Good organization, to make a group effort like this effective.\n\nThat's how religion works. It's kind of what it's for. Why we socialized primates have this urge to listen to and adulate a strong (male)^1 leader-figure. Because back on the savannah, *\"grouping up\"* conferred competitive advantages in the form of cooperation.\n\nI don't hate religion *as such.* There are ways that these impulses can be good and healthy in a modern context. I've seen some pretty cool congregations do some wonderful prosocial and altruistic things.\n\nBut the danger of that slipping into weird cult-y insular de-individualizing shit is ever-present, and in a modern democracy it's dangerous. And a small, heavily interdependent, rural farming community creates the perfect petri dish conditions to make that happen.\n\nCue Creed quote. \"I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You make more money as a leader ... But you have more fun as a follower.\"\n\nOne more thing. Despite my reservations, I actually am relatively on board with the words in OP's image, right up to \"medicinal plants.\" Sure, grow your aloe. I have my aloe still that my mom gave me years ago. It's nice for kitchen cuts and scrapes.\n\nBut for broken bones? Or ectopic pregnancies? Or crazy autoimmune problems that no-one saw coming? For the survival of each individual person, nothing is going to beat actual access to real science-based, regulated medical services. \n\nThe best fight, to improve the odds to thrive for every person, is to improve access to medical services for everyone, including rural commensalist farmers -- \n\n-- not just to give up on them, and consign them to reliance on folk remedies -- effective though some of them may *or may not* be.\n\nFrankly, this implication -- of giving up on access to actual healthcare for a small community -- can also be a red flag for cult type psychology. Sorry. I've seen people refuse blood transfusions for their kids, or mental health services for depressed, anxious people, or even *vaccines* if you can believe that shit. For religious reasons. And ... *no.*\n\nDownvote away, but this comment is made in good faith.\n\n_____\n\n^1  \"Male\" is in parentheses because -- while male leadership is not some natural default, there is a bias toward male leadership in cults because it flatters the default preconceived notions of potential followers.

There\u2019s no such thing as agree to disagree and respecting difference of opinion. Family is included in this. This has gotten worse in younger people who are \u201csuper educated\u201d on mental health yet are remarkably not mentally well.\n\nYou can look at many other Reddit boards that promote going no contact, divorce, etc. over what amounts to minor inconvenience and arguments that won\u2019t matter in a few months. It\u2019ll never work here because the idea of the village is too foreign and people want what they want when they want it. You can\u2019t hold many Americans (especially young Americans) accountable for their actions and there\u2019s very little accountability in relationships. \n\nAlso, no one wants to take care of another person anymore, especially if they don\u2019t see personal benefit. Multi generational and communal living can be a good thing and it can also breed unhealthy codependency without proper boundaries. Americans love their boundaries but can be unreasonable with those boundaries. As an American we\u2019ve taken the whole pursuit of independence and individuality too far in many aspects. We\u2019d need a big overhaul on what we believe society is supposed to be in order for this to become the norm.",

There\u2019s a whole binder everyone gets that has the values and vision statement, by-laws of the co-op, and all the community policies.

There\u2019s a sign up sheet posted in the community farmhouse and everyone takes a shift. \n\nFor the stuff that really needs to be done (mowing, invasive species control, bookkeeping, maintenance) those are all paid positions at $25/hour and people volunteer to be responsible for those tasks. We charge ourselves the equivalent of a monthly HOA fee to be sure we have enough money to pay all our \u201cemployees\u201d/bills. \n\nIf there\u2019s a special project that needs to be done in an ad hoc manner, we organize community work days and/or committees of people who care about the thing. Participation is encouraged but not required. \n\nAnd if someone is a big enough asshole, there is a legal way to for the co-op to evict. It\u2019s never happened before (if people don\u2019t jive well they have always left on their own). \n\nThere\u2019s always going to be some people who participate more than others, and for our group, that\u2019s ok.",

Absolutely heart wrenching condition- starvation, terrible scars, immobilized by hooves left untrimmed for who knows how long. Lack of veterinary care. Fear. Just awful. Many that couldn\u2019t be saved were Amish work horses who were no longer \u201cefficient\u201d at their jobs and got thrown away- usually auctioned for their price per pound. Poor creatures dammed to drawn out suffering and an inhumane end for a few extra dollars. \n\nIn contrast, their stunning carriage horses (most fashionable now being the KWPN Dutch Harness Horses- imported stallions selling for hundreds of thousands) are obviously treated very differently. They are a commodity, a business and symbolic of status. I was surprised by the embrace of this outward show of \u201cvanity\u201d and wealth by *some* members of *some* communities. I suppose people are people, no matter what beliefs they espouse. \n\n(This Dutch stallion, Hiro T, sold for over 300k \nhttps://amishcountryhorses.com/dutchvideos.htm )\n\nObviously there are countless Amish families that love and care deeply for their animals. I don\u2019t know if it is a coincidence that the worst of what I remember came from these groups or if it is ingrained in the culture that animals are simply tools. Hard to imagine feeling that way about these creatures after living with, depending on and working side by side for generations\u2026. I really hope what I witnessed was coincidence and not a norm, but I\u2019ve seen too much to be naive.\n\nI guess one danger of a closed community is that people never get held publicly accountable for allowing harmful cultural practices to become the norm. Sure, there is safety in being insulated from the world, but homogenization is a dangerous thing.",

You are obligated to show up and help or you risk being shunned. And, depending on the sect, the building, land, and animals are all owned by the church itself. So if you piss them off by refusing to give 100%, you are banished and you have nothing.\n\nThe idea of the community working together for the greater good sounds great until you realize that the community is everything and they can kick you out and leave you with nothing. I'd rather reap the rewards of my efforts and share them how I want instead of being forced to help someone I don't particularly like at the risk of losing everything.\n\nYou could argue that our modern semi-capitalist society is no different, where you're required to work a job that you might not like to pay rent to live somewhere you don't want to be, but still, you have choices. You made a choice of education, career path, etc, and nobody is forcing you to work a specific job and then taking 100% of the paycheck for your community to distribute as the elders see fit.",

Kind of like that joke that \"every friend group has that one person no one likes, and if you say yours doesn't then I have bad news.\"\n\nI'm not necessarily saying you're wrong, everyone can live their own life how they see fit. Just a different perspective to consider. There are things about the Amish community that I admire, but also reasons that it would never be for me.

Obviously protection was an issue outside of that and trade for fine and luxury goods were important, but small villages typically thrived until probably even around id say 1700s? In the new world too, smaller towns around the rockies would be self sufficient growing their own food and producing their own metal with little trading and people coming through. Life wasnt easier back then, but it was simpler and if i didnt have to sacrifice modern medicine, i would 100 percent choose to live 1400s-1800s",

Yet, they are often dehumanized to be put into homes/care facilities? What about the elderly/young and disabled who deserve to live because they exist? They are not a profitable aspect, yet we want home and community systems in place to make it work. \n\nTo me, rather than being closed minded/fearful/stuck in a capitalistic mindset (which seems inverted for a homesteader), not explore *how* things do work out? Like why aren\u2019t we learning from the successes (many who remain hidden due to the judgmental stigma\u2019s still shown in the comments) and build on it to actually shift from the tent cities we have? \n\nThere are communities investing in public housing in cities, why can\u2019t those models be scaled to outdoors? \n\nIc.org needs more people investing in it-all I can do is work on suggestions of options to those in my communities who see no way out because they are afraid of being shamed for how they live with their friends and family (with or without contracts and obligations agreed to). \n\nIt\u2019s one way to get your land, just let people become hopeless and others saying \u201cI got mine, f you\u201d\u2026.or we acknowledge that once we declared \u201ccorporations are people\u201d in the west, we deserve to also make \u201cpeople into corporations\u201d. Like co-ops/intentional communities/non-profits and more. \n\nSeek what already works and build on it. What doesn\u2019t work surrounds us daily. \n\nI have been speaking on this for years, and knowing it\u2019s not to be solved overnight. I continue to invite others to put themselves in their situations of \u201cno one can help me\u201d and see what solutions they offer in return.",

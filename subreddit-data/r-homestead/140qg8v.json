Anywhere there's an end point, if you pinch the budding leaf off the very tip during growing season, the plant thinks it's being eaten.  And will grow a branch out of one or both of the remaining leaves.  The more branches you have and the more end points when it goes to flower, the more berries you get.\n\nSo you are actually correct.\n\nBut they were referring to poison ivy.  I've learned so much about poison ivy, I don't even worry about it anymore.  I just don't touch it if it looks real glossy.  Or if I do touch it trapping through the woods, I take a different path back, even if it requires trapping through poison ivy.  The outbreak is caused by urushiol oil.  The plant doesn't normally secrete it.  Either you have to damage the leaves and stems to get at the sap/oil/juices of the plant.  Or if an animal ate on it (deer and goats use it as dewormer.  And birds eat the droups) it may secrete the plant oil through the leaves as a defense.  The leave will look more glosse when compared to other surrounding poison ivy.  Just avoid those.\n\nAnd if you do contact poison ivy, and don't want to have an outbreak, wash thoroughly with an oil or alcohol solvent (mineral oil, alcohol, olive oil, coconut oil, etc)  this dilutes the urushiol (which is technically an alcohol molecule withing the plant oil) and then wash thoroughly with permatex goop (not the gritty stuff) or dawn dish soap.  Should dilute and remove it enough to prevent outbreak.    Then zgain.. you could be completely immune.  Some people are.",

You'll need them about 6ft high.  Or you can make arches with cattle fence and T stakes to trellis them through.  If you pine the tip of each branch, it grows more branches.  Canes only produce the second year, and every year after that.  Canes will typically die back completely and be dry the following year, in 5 to 7 years.  However, removing a cane that hasn't died back, can cause the plant to grow a new one there in the next spring, if cut back in winter.it's also more productive if there's roughly 1 cane per foot.  So you can prune back one cane per 5ft of run every year and keep rotating out.",

I like it forward like that because then the canopy becomes more like a sun visor. It's a little more effective like that. When it's straight up the canopy is too high up in the air to really do much.",

They are well known in other markets outside the US. So this 4215H used to be a Branson model and just got rebranded to TYM. All the Branson attachments like front loaders and backhoes are compatible with it. It's built like a tank. All the body panels and the hood are metal, not plastic. It has some pretty powerful LED low beams and high beams. It even has DRLs like a car. It has all the same features as a big brand tractor without the price tag. This 42 horse 4WD tractor with front loader, pallet forks, and landscaping rake was $26k out the door. You can barely get a 25 horse unit for that money from the big brand dealers. Just could not beat the value of this tractor anywhere else. The Branson tractors have been praised for their durability and reliability for a long while now. It has a 6 year 2000 hour warranty as well. The dealer was also awesome to work with and put no pressure on us to buy a more expensive tractor or other attachments. I've only got 8 hours on this one but so far it has been great. I replaced a 2005 New Holland TC35DA with this and it's just better in every way.",

We plan to build up the land to get a little communal farm and housing going since we're feeling stuck in the modern life and want to work as hard as we possibly can to build something good for our futures. \nI'm feeling pretty overwhelmed with where to start, as none of us have experience with buying land, dealing with zoning, etc. I'm hoping to hear from anyone who's started their homestead, especially in canada and NS specifically as I'd love to get as much advice as I can to ensure this whole thing runs smoothly!",

I've see more than one jointly-owned property or communal turn ugly because of people fighting amongst themselves. In the past, even my husband once wanted to jointly own the family farm with his sister and her husband, but stuff happened and now they speak but aren't super friendly with each other.",

            "comment": "First thing is to talk to planning and zoning (whatever the canadian version is) in the counties (not sure what you call a district smaller than a province) you're considering.  In our county (US), you can only have one main house and one guest house per 40 acres on agriculturally zoned parcels.  You would have to subdivide into smaller lots if everyone wanted a separate house.  But then each parcel would need its own water and septic so that gets expensive, fast.  Not all places have these limitations.  Some states have laws about how many unrelated/unmarried adults can cohabitate (mostly to deter polyamory in areas inhabited by mormons but it still applies to everyone).  So one big house for everyone may also not be an option.  So talk to the county officials.  See if your plans will work and in which counties.  Then you'll at least know where to start looking.  But you'll want to talk to them about all of it.  Can you fish the trout from the stream legally?  Are the limits?  Canada has a short growing season.  What restrictions are there on greenhouses/outbuildings?  Just make sure everything you want to do is on the up and up so you can pick from the places that are cool with it and you don't have to spend all your time jumping hoops or hearing NO because you bought land where you can't do the things you want.  And also, of course, ask things like \"how long does a permit take? how much do they cost?  Any unusual restrictions or steps that people tend to stumble on?\"\n\nMost importantly, hire a lawyer.  A good one.  And draw up paperwork for what happens if someone wants to leave.  Does the community have to cover their share?  Do they have to find someone to keep covering it?  Does the community get a say in who the replacement is or are you just stuck with whoever buys in?  What happens to equity?  If we all pay in $10k to start but by the time I wanna leave, the property has tripled in value, do I get any of that equity back?  What will be the policies and procedures for large purchases?  If half the community wants to buy a tractor and the other half wants to build a barn, how do we decide which one the money goes to?  If I don't want us to have a tractor, do I still have to pay for it?  What if I never use the tractor?  Stuff like that that's likely to come up is better written out and agreed to beforehand, than after.  And the list goes on and on.  That's just off the top of my head.",

I am homesteading in East Hants, NS, where planning restrictions are mild, whereas right next door in West Hants they are super strict. These regulations are different in different municipalities. In Nova Scotia we also have the situation that there is not much fertile soil in the province, and wide areas are completely unsuitable for gardening or agriculture.",

I havent seen much in terms of how many people can live on the property  so thats a great question to ask. \nIf people are gonna be building permanent dwellings we're essentially thinking of splitting an acre or so just to make them the title holder since as far as I can tell that's a requirement but again more research will need to be done. \nIn terms of equity it's gonna be split into equal shares. If people wanna leave, We've discussed that those who wanna stay have first dibs on buying back at a discounted price to keep the land in the groups possession while still making sure there's profit for the seller. We don't really care about money in terms of splitting honestly, we come from poorer backgrounds and have been running ourselves into the dirt trying to get a good future going. So we approach it with more of a fairness outlook making sure that as long as you're in you're in and have an equal share of profits and decisions will be unanimous as much as possible, but I agree 100% with making everything contractual and legal just to make sure things can run smooth as possible",

                            "comment": "I would check on hat 215sqft law.  In *most* jurisdictions, there's also another caveat somewhere that exempts inhabited structures.  So anything that's a dwelling of any size still has to be built to code, inspected, and given a certificate of occupancy (of course any/all of this may be different in CA).\n\nI would also check on that 1 acre plan.  In our state, any parcel under an acre that isn't on municipal sewage has to get a specialized sewage system that costs $10k more than a standard system.  It's one of those things where making each parcel 1.1 acre would exempt you and save you $10k per house but you wouldn't know that if you hadn't accidentally stumbled across some random PDF that mentions it while looking for something else like I did.  lol.\n\nThere are other smaller things like how would the rural addressing work if you have multiple homes on just one parcel or will they make you subdivide them all?\n\nI would also ask that you CAN parcel off 1 acre segments.  Where we are, there are limitations to how small a parcel can be and remain considered agricultural.  Once you get down to a certain size, it's forcibly rezoned into another classification like \"ResAg\" or \"Residential\" and then you're subject to a whole different set of codes and restrictions.  And certain areas you can't have parcels below a certain size because the zoning won't allow for it.  There was a time we considered parceling off a chunk of our land and it turned into a 1 hour discussion with planning and zoning about the best ways to break up the land to keep the most beneficial zoning but still achieve various results.  I think your biggest hurdle is going to be figuring out legally acceptable sewage treatment for each dwelling.  Once you get that sorted, everything else will be pretty easy.  It'll just depend on local laws what treatment options are legally accepted and then which among those your parcel actually qualifies to use and then which of those you're actually willing to build/pay for.\n\nSounds like you've got some good ideas on how to draw things up.  Just be sure everyone agrees and signs.  And be ready for shit to get stupid.  People don't always show their real selves until it's too late for you to gtfo.  So having your own personal backup plan in case the community is a complete failure is not a terrible idea.  If 20 years from now things are still great and you wanna drain the rainy day fund to buy something you'll have it.  But if 3 years from now you realize this was a huge mistake and you don't have anything set aside for starting up individually if it goes sideways, you could end up homeless.\n\nOther things to consider in the legal documents:  What if someone just stops paying their share?  Without knowing how you plan to finance this:  What if someone just can't afford their share but no one else can cover it?  If you plan to just build slowly as the cash comes in, what happens if someone doesn't have their share on due day?  What are the penalties?  How long before they're evicted (how long can the community cover their portion)?",

You can work a remote job from any internet connection, and Starlink probably covers your latitude... but on the financial side, you'll want more money than you think. \n\nTechnology is expensive, and you'll pay in time and pain if you try to do everything the pre-industrial way. Do you like having electricity? Reddit? Indoor plumbing? Toilets? Showers? Packaged foods if something goes wrong with the garden? Insulated walls? Good metal roofs to catch rain from, and good tanks to save the rain in for when you need it? All these, and more, are expenses that our ancestors who homesteaded handled by not having the nice things.\n\nOh, and if you're going in to co-owning land, imagine the worst possible situation that it could end up with, and make sure the legal arrangements handle that situation in a satisfactory way. What if one person develops a medical condition that alters their moods and temperament and makes them irrational and impossible to deal with? What if someone burns down the buildings? What if someone gets into huge personal debt through drugs and gambling? What if someone starts bringing around strangers to the place that steal your stuff? A good plan will address the general case of bad things happening, and protect everyone involved.",

My one consideration is how well do you truly know your friends (i.e. living habits, quirks that drive you insane, etc)? The thing about a communal homestead is that it is only as good as the willingness of everyone participating and working together. Conflicts happen but need to be resolved asap, or the whole thing unravels and people walk away. \n\nIf you have not, maybe try going on a camping trip with everyone buying into this. Get to experience their habits and see if this is the right fit. I get a feeling you will be stuck in a type of a near camping situation for the early stages of development.",

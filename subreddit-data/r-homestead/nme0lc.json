                    "comment": "I used to work for a manufactured home lender, and I unfortunately have to disagree with your statement with a caveat. Most mobile homes will be setup on footers but not affixed permanently to the land they sit on, therefore they are not structurally supported by the land and can be ripped apart in a storm, especially if they are single wide and made with thin paneling rather than sheetrock. Despite the former name \"mobile home\", they are not at all mobile once they are set in place. They settle into the land where initially established, and if you try to move it again, not only is it incredibly expensive (we're talking 5 figures professionally), but there is a high likely hood the stress of moving will stress the home and can cause some unseen damage that can be exacerbated as years pass.\n\nThey also do not hold their value. A manufactured home will be considered personal property, not just for tax reasons but also for appraisal reasons, and thus they will depreciate much like a car, boat, or plane. In 30 years they will not be worth 10% of what you paid.\n\nNext let's talk financing. Most lenders will not give you a loan for a manufactured home. They do not hold enough equity for the lender to recoup their loan should the owner default or foreclose. There are some lenders that will, however they will charge high interest rates, anywhere from 5-15%, depending on credit, and charge even higher origination fees. And thus this creates a high likely hood for the borrower to be underwater: where they owe more on the loan amount than what their home is worth.\n\nAlso let's talk true affordability: A $100,000 manufactured home purchased with a $90,000 loan, 10% down payment at a 8% interest rate and 30 year amortizing term will be a $660.39 monthly payment. Sound hella cheap, right? For 30 years you will have paid $147739 in interest alone which is 164% of your principal. You're paying 1.64 times the principal to buy this asset on credit. The same P/I with a 3.00 interest rate, you could borrow $156,637 and only pay $81,103 of interest. The same $10,000 downpayment means you could afford a home that's worth $166,637 and you're effectively paying less money overall for more house.\n\nHowever, I mentioned a caveat. A manufactured home is only \"affordable\" if you do it the right way: put 20% down, put it on your own lien-free land, actually affix it to the land which converts it from personal to real property and try to find a lender who'd be willing to offer you a competitive rate, like 3%. But any other options and you're throwing money away.\n\nOf course this is strictly an apples to apples comparison. Property Taxes, HOA Fees and insurance will drastically vary in each location and with the value of the home itself, which can make the Dollar per Dollar comparison of a manufactured home vs site-built home harder to compare. Also, the supply of houses in my area that are between 150-200k is damn near non-existent so you would have to look deeper at a long term dollar comparison.",

You'll never at all hear this kind of stuff from a loan originator or a salesman at a Retail Center. You wouldn't believe how many people sign for these loans and not understand at all what they're getting into. I'm not saying you should avoid these like the plague, but home buying is a very important decision and one should absolutely weigh the pros, cons, logistics, and the opportunity cost of each and every scenario they research. \n\nA not so fun fact: in the late 90's and early 2000's, well before Dodd-Frank, RESPA and TRID laws were a thing, it wasn't uncommon to buy a manufactured home on simple interest amortization, where interest accrues daily, exactly like a car loan. At my last company I always shook my head when we'd see simple interest loans that originated in 1995-1999 that we would still be servicing. What's worse is that the borrowers were consistently behind payments or would pay every 3 months. These same borrowers, after 20+ years, would have paid down literally 5,000 -10,000 of their Principal and instead all the money they paid would go to interest. We're talking amounts of 100k-150k plus over 20 ish years. \n\nThe manufactured housing Industry has gotten better within the last 10 years but it used to be a very shady business.",

Sound hella cheap, right? For 30 years you will have paid $147739 in interest alone which is 164% of your principal.\n\nOk so I didn't do any of that. I bought a used trailer from 1985, I paid $5000 cash. It was already on a lot in a park where the lot fees run me a crushing $200/month with trash pickup and water included. I'm not talking about buying a brand new trailer from a manufacturer, and I'm DEFINITELY not talking about buying land in a neighborhood with a HOA lmao. I'm talking about buying a cheap used trailer in a trailer park. Very informative comment otherwise, it just doesn't really apply to what I'm talking about. Trailer parks are infamous for ex-cons and addicts, you think those kinds of people are getting $100,000 mortgages? Haha, no. Not to mention this is going to vary a lot depending on where you live; in my area in rural Tennessee, $100,000 is going to get you a lovely 3 bedroom, two story house on an acre of land. Only a complete moron in my area would pay $100,000 for a trailer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course my trailer is depreciating, but I don't care about that because I'm going to just junk it when I'm done with it. I've been here 3 years and it's already paid for itself several times over in money saved that I would have been spending renting a 1 bedroom apartment for $800/month. I just kept my $800/month rent budget the same, only I put the other $600 into savings. I have saved roughly $20k since moving here, that's in cash in the bank. Again, I made an initial investment of 5k, and now I have 20k. I dunno man, I feel pretty good about my move here.",

After the all clear I assessed that life is short and I wanted the best for my 3 kids currently was going to be sat paying my mortgage on a town house that was already too small for another 25yrs, so I borrowed as much money as I could from family friends and banks and bought 21 acres of land. Nothing on it, no electric, water etc. Bought some calves and put up a small shed, bought some more calves and put up a bigger shed, did all this whilst working full time selling Agri supplies. Got planning for temporary dwelling, ie mobile home, put up another shed, more calves etc, planning passed for permanent dwelling. It\u2019s not quite 6 years since i completed on the fields, when I\u2019m less tired I think I\u2019ll feel more chuffed with myself. Anything is possible with enough desire.,",

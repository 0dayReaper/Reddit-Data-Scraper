    "postText": "A bamboo trellis can last up to 10 years before it needs to be replaced.  Bamboo is strong, so it can hold up the weight of plants with long vines and heavy fruit.Bamboo is also lightweight, which makes it easy to move your trellis if you change your mind about the location.\n\nHere is how I built one and gave my yard that Tropical Look that I was looking for\n\n[https://youtu.be/g2drXw9kT8I](https://youtu.be/g2drXw9kT8I)\n\nMaterials You would need to built a  6 and half feet tall, six feet wide and 3 ft thick bamboo trellis -&gt;\n\nDrill, Drill Bit , Nails and Screws, Ladder and a Hammer\n\nTamp Bar, Post Hole Digger\n\nBamboo Posts : 4 , Bamboo beams : 4 , Bamboo slats (perlins) : 16\n\nI bought bamboo posts and slats online from [foreverbamboo.com](https://foreverbamboo.com) \n\nStep 1 :  Stain and seal the posts. Make sure to keep the posts indoors before sealing.\n\nUse pure Tung Oil and dry them outside for 24 hrs.Double coat the surface of the sections that go underground.\n\nStep 2: Dig a foot and few inches deep holes using a digger. Those few inches are where we will be pouring a gravel. This will help prevent rot and help increase the lifespan of the poles.Bamboos are naturally termites and fungi resistant, don't use any chemical as it will leech into the garden soil\n\nStep 3: Fill in the post with gravel , tamp and try to keep the posts straight and aligned together. Pour some more gravel, small amount at a time, give a firm tap using the Tamp bar.\n\nCement is not required if you fill in some and tamp and fill more and tamp and continue the process.I am using Bully 48-in Steel Spike Aerator.\n\nStep 4: Fix the beams and use exterior screws long enough to go half way through the post and beams. Make sure to pre-drill holes, if not it is guaranteed to split the poles and damage it. This is where the water will get in and rot the poles.\n\nStep 5: Fix the rails or Purlins. You can also use the Rafters if you wish. I am using bamboo slats as Purlins. They come pre-treated and hence I am not sealing them. I used 1 and half inches nails to fix them with the post and the beams. Pre-drill holes before nailing.\n\nStep 6: Water the Footings and enjoy your bamboo trellis !",

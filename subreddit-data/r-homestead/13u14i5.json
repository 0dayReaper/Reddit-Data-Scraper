Hay, newspaper, cardboard, unused fabric, burlap, specialized garden cloth or even corrugated siding in combination with other things are better choices.\n\nedit: [What I did after seeing your post](https://imgur.com/a/pXzXptC) and commenting.",

Fencing around the garden is just 4x4 posts with 1x6 deck boarding. Keeps the deer out. (Just in case someone questions this, because of how high deer can jump, an old Dutchman vunce told me if you fence your garden like this a deer will not enter because when they see the fence on the other side, they believe they will be stuck inside the enclosure once they get in. Never once had a deer jump inside to get into the garden.)",

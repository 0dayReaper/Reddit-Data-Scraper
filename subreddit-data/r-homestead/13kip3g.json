Burned down so thoroughly that the wire was laying on top of the foundation like someone walked around and laid it there. Watch videos of how fast it burns. Totally involved fire took 10 secs. I will never use it again. People should be warned. Watch a YouTube video about spray foam fires. We used fireproof drywall and paint. I\u2019d use Rockwool.",

I did find a video from This Old House and it seemed simple to install the Rockwood in the attic. \n\nJust wondering if you did install in the attic how difficult was it and did you have to do anything extra outside of installing the Rockwool?\n\n\nSorry. You probably will get two notifications for this. Went to correct a word autocorrect changed and accidentally deleted my comment.",

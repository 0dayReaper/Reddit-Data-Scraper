            "comment": "This week in the shop we finished up this Jotul F-500 Oslo, originally in Indigo Blue.\n\nWhen the owner had dropped it off to the shop, I could tell that the stove has had a long life, and was used hard. But it was in a beautiful Indigo Blue, which is a very rare color for Jotuls, and was only available for a short time. So of course, I was very excited to bring it back to life.\n\nBut, during breakdown, I found the dreaded top crack on the lid, under the top cover, where most Oslos crack from being overfired at some point in time. This was devastating because Jotul no longer makes replacement parts in Indigo, and trying to get a new part enameled to match is very cost prohibitive, and there is no guarantee the finished part will actually match. \n\nThis means the only option that was left was to take and get all the original enamel sandblasted off. Which is no easy feat and requires essentially an industrial strength sandblaster to remove.  But thankfully my good friend at Memorial Sandblast here in Barre Vermont was able to handle in a little over 3 hours of blasting. \n\nOnce this was done and we were back down to bare cast iron, it was time to paint and rebuild with all required new parts, pieces, hardware, gaskets, and cement.\n\nAs bittersweet as it was to remove such beautiful enamel from this stove, I am very pleased with how it came out. And I am very happy that in the end we were still able to save the stove and bring it back to life. The most important person, the client, was also very pleased with the results and happy to have the stove back in such perfect shape, ready to heat for another 2 decades at least!\n\nIf you love stoves as much as I do, I suggest you check out r/woodstoving as well!

The finish on the blue enamel is glossy polished glass like finish, and the top would just be satin black paint, which is still a matte black essentially. And even if you gloss over the paint, it wont last and even at its best the finish still wont match the blue enamel.\n\nBut hey, if a client said they want it mismatched like that, I would warn them the same way, and if they still wanted it, I would do it for them.",

Its specialty high temp silicone stove paint, and you only get the 15 colors or so they supply and thats it. \n\nSo you can try to mix colors and try to get it close, but its a risky venture at about $70 per quart per color, and if you dont mix enough then you gotta try it again. And not all the color mix perfect, in fact, the only mixing that is really suggested is that if you are out of satin black, you can mix clear coat into flat black and get satin black. \n\nIf you look back at my posts, I have done colored stoves for Vintage Elm stoves, but all of those stoves were originally offered in those colors of paint. \n\nAnd I will make sure to reiterate again, this is not a stove that I sold, this was a clients private restoration that was brought to me to do and we discussed it and decided the best and easiest thing to do in regards to long term maintance and for it to look like a traditional  and real Jotul, is to just go with the satin black.\n\nIf the client wanted to do a colored paint, it would have almost doubled the paint cost because color is more expensive than black, but I 100 percent would have done it and it would be beautiful still.",

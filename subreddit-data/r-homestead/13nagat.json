    "postText": "What genius decided that inflatable tires were a good idea for farm equipment?  tried to inflate this tubeless mower tire and the whole valve stem came out. It hasn't really held air for a while anyway. Wouldn't hold any air. No replacements available without special order, so I grabbed a can of spray foam and just filled it up. Held my  gloved finger over the stem until it hardened, about five minutes. This worked so well I'm going to do it to the other tire and maybe my wheelbarrow too. Thorns? Nails? We don't care about none o' that!",

You are correct that some chemicals in this class need water to react, but not spray foam: \n\nhttps://www.buildingenergyvt.com/energy-efficiency/the-simple-science-behind-spray-foam-insulation/#:~:text=Spray%20foam%20insulation%20is%20developed,react%20to%20expand%20and%20harden.",

But the stuff in cans from the hardware store is a single-part urethane and it is always catalyzed with water AFAIK. That's why you can block the little tube up and still use the can again the next day, you're keeping water vapor off it well enough to keep it from curing overnight.\n\nAny vessel where air is compressed/decompressed will make water precipitate out of the air, like an air compressor tank for instance. A tire is likely to have some amount of water in it so the single part foam might cure fine and I shot my mouth off for nothing. : )",

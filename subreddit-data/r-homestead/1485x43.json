Both various farm animals and veggies flourish in this area.  Somewhere decently affordable (3kish an acre to 5k perhaps). \n\nVery good for materials such as trees for wood/lumber, grasses for sod construction for barns, etc.   Higher drinkable water tables to not need deep wells.  Springs count.\n\nI'd love thoughts on this.   I think many seek this type of lifestyle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The other commenter suggested parts Texas which is also not a bad idea but I think you'll get more rain in Arkansas but maybe at the cost of some sun. That being said there are a lot of solar companies wanting to lease land in the part of the country. Furthermore depending on how off the grid you want to get, land can be found for 2k or under an acre.",

Our pasture had dirt brought in and it set us back several years on establishing the forage for our animals since it was mostly red clay brought in. But everywhere else is dark black rich soil. The trees are mostly hardwoods we use to build structures and other things. Summers are more mild in the foothills of the mountains, its june and was 58 this morning. So the plants get a cool down break at night. I couldnt see us living anywhere else.",

Pleasant climate most of the time (temps above 90s or below 20s uncommon). State of Georgia has the strongest private property rights in the US according to CATO.\nBought my place on a river with a pond, creeks, mature hardwoods, planted pines, and former ag field for about 2600/acre in 2020.",

I mean you want:  Good light for year round solar, fertile soil, decent rainfall, usable lumber, and easy water access for $3-5k per acre.\n\nI would say the best options are either pick TWO or learn how to build a time machine.  \n\nI hope you or someone else proves me wrong but I don't know where you'll find property that comes close to all those things.  There's land out there for $3-5k... it's just not good land with water and lumber and fertile soil.  Hell, parcels near us in the desert with NO water and NO power NO lumber can sometimes go for up to $1000/acre.  And it's just about the worst land you can get short of buying a former cesspit or something.  So usable land for that price seems like a pipe dream.  Not trying to shit on your dreams just being realistic.\n\nBut that's not to say you can't get lucky.  We paid $300/acre in an area where the going rate was more like $500-1000 just by watching the listings like a hawk and being ready to pounce when the right deal showed up.  But that took like a year of stalking the listings every chance I got.  But you're really looking for a perfect parcel.  Livable, ready to develop and an affordable price... the rare times those even come up in listings everyone pounces on it and you're too late or the bidding war drives up the price to market value anyhow.",

However, land in the river basin that had the water rights sold off of it is inexpensive.  The water table is high and it\u2019s very easy to dig a shallow irrigation well for your home use, to water a garden.",

It seems to have gone down a few inches in the last few days.  \n\nWe're getting irrigation water every time we ask for it, although we may wait a few days so they can fit us in on the ditch.  The MRGCD is still running a LOT of water to Texas, to pay back the big water debt we acquired over the last several years.  Have you seen the river at Las Cruces lately?  It's unbelievable!  I can honestly say in 23 years down here, I've never seen it this high, this long, with all this runoff.\n\nAlso, with the Bosque flooded, you won't believe the wildlife we've seen:  We saw a bull elk and 2 cow elk cross 346 in the early morning, walking along the ditch bank.  My husband saw a mountain lion crossing 346 right on top of the ditch bank.  No, not a bobcat, a MOUNTAIN LION.  I'd heard they were around but never saw one.  When the river is in flood, you finally see all the wildlife that lives down in the bosque and travels up and down the river.  Hope you are doing ok on the east side.  It's dry and windy with no rain in sight but we are supposed to have an El Nino pattern this year, so get ready!",

And being in a 4 sided basin, we get TONS of condensation (have even discussed Fog Harvesting).  I saw a mountain lion once, too!  Luckily I was in a car and nowhere near it.\n\nI knew it'd be up this year.  I was just curious what it  was like at the worst.  Haven't been through Las Cruces at all this year.  My brother passed away and we were back home a lot first helping while he was sick and then for the funeral and whatnot.\n\nI hear you on the dry and windy.  It's annoying because we were supposed to be in that lull between La Nina and El Nino and then bam! El Nino.  I'm not looking forward to it but I'm hoping we'll hate the wind a lot less once we have an actual house to be inside instead of just a tent lol!  So I try to tell myself it's not as bad as it seems because we get so little reprieve right now.",

So we spent more time back home than planned, helping my brother.  She was the one who did all the cooking and shopping and stuff.  He was lost.  But his son was there to help, too so we didn't spend a ton of time.  Then in summer 2022 his son passed and we spent even more time because he was really just so so lost on his own.  Then this summer he decided to join them, I guess.  And since it's just too cold to live in a tent there in the winter, we just keep getting farther behind, spending the warm months back home for all these funerals.  I've told my family no one else is allowed to die until I finish the house but I'm the youngest and nobody ever listens to me.",

    "postText": "Hi, hoping the community can help me identify what\u2019s leaving large piles on my new (unfinished) driveway. My uneducated assumption is crayfish (just from posts on Reddit) but I\u2019m new to this area! I\u2019m also not sure if I need to be concerned or am not thinking of something important. \n\nLocation: south Puget Sound\nOn property: driveway cuts through a seasonal water flow - I hesitate to call it a creek because there\u2019s no \u2018stream\u2019, water just flows through the area in a fairly shallow manner.\nFrequency: one showed up the day after the driveway was cut in, two more the following day.\nPhotos (hoping they show up): I did find one pile with what seemed like a small hole a few inches away. \n\nI do plan to install a culvert to help maintain the road structure! \n\nThank you in advance and psyched to finally be \u2018on property\u2019 and able to participate more in the future!",

When their mounds dry, they can be rough mounds of dried out clay.  Interesting side info- there are many potters who love the clay the crawdads bring to the surface, fairly pure clay that takes minimal cleaning. https://lh5.ggpht.com/WW9iyQ-Cy3XAqWbBYI8r1zzmkS9d7QhPF0ZAuwE5QC3OHxH5u4\\_HuzpOepUEq11jzE04vfE9HThfV2t4SKp9=s580",

Maybe not as efficient, one mound at a time, but I was not a fan of laying cyanide a foot underground, and didn't like finding calves with broken legs, either",

    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019ve been following this subreddit for a while as homesteading has always been a dream of mine. My great grandmother and grandfather homesteaded original land in Montana almost 100 years ago and it\u2019s something that\u2019s always interested me. However, I know there\u2019s tons of places to get cheap land and building your own house wouldn\u2019t be terribly expensive, but I\u2019m curious how everyone is able to afford everything that\u2019s needed to maintain their land. Livestock, trucks, tractors, gardens farms etc and that not everyone here is a successful farmer from their own land..\nSo what do y\u2019all do for income or employment? I currently work in the trades and I couldn\u2019t imagine being able to do that if I had land as the driving to job sites would be horrible. Also considering all the work that would be needed to maintain my land. On top of that I can imagine owning a few acres of land requires pretty extensive maintenance  that takes a lot of time and energy. Are a lot of people who have land retired, come from money, have high income jobs, or do alot of you work 9-5\u2019s and still able to maintain your property?",

From having a few chickens and a garden to living off grid and trying to completely support urself on ur land. The amount of resources needed to support it is different.",

He's a dude who got cancer from eating fast food 14+ meals a week and once he had it removed turned his attention to maximizing his space and knowledge. I can't personally vouch for everything he says but it's motivational and the message is (he literally says this a bunch of times) \"DO WHAT YOU CAN WITH WHAT YA GOT. No one can fault you for that.\"\n\nETA: he'd prob say you're already homesteading too, doesn't take a hundred acres.",

You hear a lot in the news about the VA not treating people well, and this country has an odd veteran-worship fetish, but as a federal govt employee I have met a TON of vets, and the majority of them are milking the taxpayer for all they possibly can, often based on complete lies, and no, most have never been in combat.

I know one vet guy who decided he'd convince a psychiatrist he had PTSD to get disability payments... From his three years on a navy boat in the mid 90's. Funny thing is he is law enforcement, and somehow word got around and they took his gun away and put him on desk duty because he convinced someone he was mentally unstable. Of course he sued and won so is back in action, presumably with his fat disability check too.\n\nWe really need to get strict about defining service based disability. The commenter above sounds like he really earned it, but I've yet to meet a vet collecting disability that everyone didn't roll their eyes at. I'd wager 90% of vet disability payments are based on complete fiction.",

If it happens cool, but don't expect it. Farmers are barely profitable without assistance. The way to accomplish this for I'd say the majority of people is to get yourself financially secure enough to be able to do it, and being self-sufficient is a plus, not something you have to do to be secure and independent. \n\nThat's probably why you see so many people talk about retiring to a farm sort of situation. Of course there's 10k variations of homesteading and how to accomplish it. You can do this at poverty levels if you want, but your factors and lifestyle will adjust accordingly.",

You can technically profit, even eventually surpass infrastructure costs, but making a real living is difficult. It's all supplementary for most people. Most of my hobbies make money and in some shape or form stem from homesteading, or are because we have the space for it. For example I harvest wood and either build projects with the lumber or save on heating costs. \n\nSimilar to a lot of big farmers where a big chunk of their net worth is in machinery and capital investments, the majority of that side money goes into investing into the farm. I'm not buying tractors with it, but lots of other little things to make work easier, etc.",

I own a real estate business and am a property manager, but I've started to get out of that in recent years because of the stress. I only have one rental property right now, so the work is minimal. I also am a spec-fic author who worked 100-hour weeks writing and publishing books from 2012 to late-2019. I gained enough traction throughout that time to last, so I still make royalties on a monthly basis with 0 average weekly hours (I'm not quitting the business--just super busy). Lastly, I own a second business specializing in yoga therapy and teach yoga and myofascial release therapy (a type of physical therapy) \"full-time\". Full-time hours for yoga instructors are 8 or more classes per week, and I currently teach 10 per week, about to turn 13 in June. With traveling hours and private clients, I spend 20-30 hours per week working in this field depending on demand.\n\nAll that said, I make full-time money working part-time hours considering this combo, so I'm able to dedicate a lot of my time to my food forest. Because my husband works from home, he's able to dedicate extra time on lunches/breaks to processing harvests, food preservation, and little DIY projects I hand to him that I don't have time for. It works and it's lovely.",

I'd say the mortgage is long paid off, but there never was one.  My GGG Grandma bought this 260 acres for cash in 1872.\n\nI market garden, and sell at 2 markets a week, that alone is a lot of work June through October.  I do some work, 10 to 20 hours a week all year, doing what I did in corporate America but from my kitchen table on a laptop. I have some other side hustles I do, all online, when I feel like it. \n\nI'm not fancy, don't have many expenses.  My truck is a 1997, I live in a 5th wheel camper that is parked in my pole building at the back of the home place and rent out the main farm house to a nice younger family.  Seemed silly for just me and an old dog to be hogging up a whole 3 bedroom house.  \n\nYou talk about time to maintain, May through October that's a good chunk on time.  I mow once a week, just mowing takes 6.5 hours, then there is an hour or 2 string trimming, weeding flower beds, etc just to maintain the home farm. Buildings need painted every few years, trees seem to constantly need limbing, I don't even have any livestock right now so I can't help there.\n\nAnyway, my 3 siblings pay the taxes on the home farm and crop land and I take care of literally everything else.",

She altered some floor plans she got from the University of Illinois booth at the State Fair and it was built in 1959.  One story, brick ranch with a full concrete block basement and a sweet mid century modern kitchen.

Learning to build homes and repair them properly has been one of the most expensive things I've ever done, whether you count the cost in in terms of time, money, aggravation, or all combined. Legend has it, and you may have heard this already, that the first building you ever build is always a throwaway. Mine was a 900 square foot split-level straw bale for $20K, surely \"not terribly expensive\". But what a disaster! We survived living there for three years and then it became a kind of homeless shelter for friends temporarily down on their luck for another eighteen before eventual demolition. The porcupines liked it. My skills have improved, but it took a lot of sweat and tears. The labor paid off in the end. We now own two decent homes, one for us to homestead and one for income as an AirBnB. Both were rehabbed by us, completely, no hired help, both saved from tipping into their cellar holes by blood, sweat, and tears, and so both were purchased and eventually repaired for, counting the materials but not labor, about 40% of their current value. We owe only about $30K on this fine demesne and will easily pay it off in about four more years. But it wasn't easy. One trade is just a starter. I was an aircraft technician in the military. That was my first. Then vehicle repair. Then electrical. Framing, plumbing, HVAC, farming, gardening, etc, &amp;c. And to pay for all this I had to work a full time job too. Luckily my job involved teaching shop class, among other things, so there was some overlap. After forty years, I now sincerely believe I can fix just about anything and make most simple things, and I probably can. But it surely wasn't easy, and forty years of learning is an expensive investment anyway you cut it.",

Not including travel time you can be in and out with a nice check.\n\nI also teach soil science at a technical college I'm the winter as organic inspections happen during the growing season.\n\nWorth noting that you are reviewing a ton of paperwork and require an in depth understanding of the US national organic program.

We don't own a tractor or a mower. We invest in livestock and cheap chicken tractors we build.  We were profitable after our first run and we never looked back.

Work from 6am-6pm lately then come home and work outside till dark then into the shop to do maintenance on my tractor or building things I need for storage and productivity. \n\nWith all that I love growing all my plants if I could replace my income I would gladly go full time at it.

What you do when you\u2019re required to be productive is subjective for this lifestyle I think. Some people do make it work off grid selling overstock veggies and meat.

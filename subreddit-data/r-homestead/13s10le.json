    "postText": "I just need to vent to some people who might understand this.\n\nI probably sound like a jerk, but seriously - PSA to those who do this - I don't care how good your dog is on your property, that doesn't mean they act like that everywhere else. Furthermore, if I keep my dogs out of your yard and property, keep yours out of mine!\n\nMy land is used as a farm. I raise soy free, corn free, pasture raised chickens and ducks for eggs and meat. It's expensive to raise these animals and they keep getting killed despite having barbed wire fencing up. We've recently reinforced fencing on 3 of the acres we have after an incident where a whole pack of dogs came and attacked and ripped apart a quail cage. Literally they shredded the damn plywood and ripped a quail through the hardware cloth.\n\nRecently a dog dug under my duck cage and took a duck. I have a photo of the dog on my trail camera 100 ft from the duck cage. I sent it to the neighbor who refuses to speak to me now - I didn't even ask for reimbursement or anything, just gently reminded them I didn't want the damage to be done to our relationship if we had to dispatch their dogs.\n\nSo many people I've seen around here in similar situations say \"my dog doesn't hurt the birds here!\" Or \"my dog doesn't dig in the garden here!\". I just want more people to realize that just like your kids, when your dog knows you're not watching - they're tearing shit up they know they shouldn't be.\n\nI'm just upset to lose friendships over this kind of stuff. I know good fences make good neighbors, but I'm getting really tired of having to pretty much build a wall around my property because other people think letting their dogs roam everywhere is ok.",

He had them for years, spoke highly of them, and if you ask anyone who knew, they admit they *were* really good dogs. Of course they roamed the property. It wasn\u2019t until my sister was born/learned to walk that the dogs started acting predatory. One winter when my sister was barely 3, everyone was outside helping participate in wood gathering, and one of the hounds took my sister down from behind. Being a baby in the 80s she was packed right into her little snow suit. All the dog got was mouthfuls of whatever that material is. Mom ripped her from the ground, and away from the dog, and as soon as they were clear, *boom*! Dead dog. Grandpa didn\u2019t hesitate. \n\nMy sister\u2019s snow suit, around the neck, was absolutely shredded. She had enough of that, scarves, and sweaters, they never actually got to her throat. She had rocks in her gums, and was a little cut up in the face (when you get thrown down face first, happens); and other than being shook up, my sister was fine. Grandpa soon dispatched the second one too. \u201cLet\u2019s not f*ck around and find out.\u201d kind of thing.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: I was reminded the second one had practically become feral when the first one was killed. It emerged from where the the first pounced from, and had begun circling my grandpa, growling. My mom had straight up run with her baby because mom instincts/panic.",

I think it's hard for people to wrap their minds around the idea that their pet, who is lovely, sweet and well behaved with them, might not be the same animal around other people and animals. I'm also not surprised to hear that the dogs were hybrids. It's so difficult for them to fight against their predator instinct and it makes them very unpredictable. They're beautiful animals, and people can develop strong bonds with them but they're not great pets because they are still essentially wolves. Your grandpa made the right decision even though it must have sucked.",

But if the owner is just negligent, or repeatedly loses control of their animal, there's no point talking to them about it further. \n\nBringing it up with other people whose livestock were impacted: Probably a good thing, if you know and trust them. Where I'm at, folks who keep livestock tend to share a lot of information with each other about what predators we're seeing in the area. Knowing that a given predator got stopped is a useful data point to have. \n\nBringing it up with people who aren't involved: Nothing good comes of bringing it up in detail. Bringing up the gist can be good for cultural norms -- \"folks out here have occasionally had to shoot stray dogs for killing their livestock\" level of detail to make people aware that it's a thing which happens -- but  info on *who* got *whose* stray is never necessary.",

We never saw them again. But the onwer came cuz they were show dogs and the police determined we were within our rights. Now I have a  lab that comes often to my property but he\u2019s just got shitty owners and I let him in The house and feed him for a few days and he wanders back home. You have to remember that city folk dump their poor scared and hungry pets in the country  just to get rid of them so I take many of these dogs in and give them to my sisters and aunts and uncles where they have become part of the family.

Can also be a bit of a challenge with guests dogs but when handled properly it's fine. \n\nAlso recommend electric fencing AND hard fencing for protection from most predators.

Some of them had like 12 labs for duck hunting. During coyote hunts, dogs would literally come through your property in groups of 50 to 100. \n\nWe never had any problems, and then I realized why once I was older. \n\nThere are good dogs that stay on their property, and they do know what their property is after a while, and then there were wanderers... they were never seen again. My grandparents were veterinarians for 8 counties around us. The number of dogs that would show up dead was astounding. \n\nThe wanderers inevitably get a pack together and they start roaming wreaking havoc on people's chickens, livestock, some would chase deer into fences so their heads would get stuck and they would eat their hind ends, alive, and leave them. So, naturally, people would see the dogs run through their property, they'd grab their 30-06 and follow behind them, and then... well... no more dog problems.",

They do not kill or eat chickens, hogs, sheep, or any other type of animals, most they do is chase off deer barking up a storm and run off after coyotes that stray too close, which they very rarely do now that I have them. They roam so they can protect my livestock and property and by extension protect the livestock and property of my (very very) distant neighbors. We\u2019ve had issues with them tearing out trash but both neighbors have told me (after I profusely apologized) that they\u2019d rather have some torn out trash than dead chickens or cows. Now I have one dog who can\u2019t help but go after birds it\u2019s just his nature, and he\u2019s not allowed to free roam and is bound to an electric perimeter. Not every dog is free roam material, MOST are too untrained or frankly not the right breed to just roam about. Two beagles have been killed by my GPs because they were let to roam by a very distant neighbor far over a few hills. The beagles came onto my property and too near my chicken coop and my two guard dogs got ahold of them and in the morning I found them. Specific dogs can roam without issue, but a massive amount, in my opinion, should not be left to roam freely",

That time my husband and I went over together and we weren't nice this time. We told them we have children and at this point we don't trust they won't go after our kids and we see their dogs as an aggressive threat and we will shoot them the next time we see them on our property. \n\nThe next morning they were out at our neighbors going after their calves.

Plus we have livestock guardian dogs to protect if anything were to happen. There\u2019s also many local laws saying that you have a right to shoot any animals ( besides bears for some odd reason) that are killing livestock. The farmer has the right to do that because your animals are you business and it\u2019s what feeds you and your family. Not many people want to go with that route because it may seem heartless or inhumane. At the end of the day I\u2019m going to protect my property and animals 100 percent of the time. With that being said not all dogs that cross our property our problem animals. I think the problem begins with poor dog training/ ownership. I know one fella who has over 30 dogs because he just refuses to get them fixed. They have slaughtered countless cats, goats, sheep around the community. I\u2019ve done made a decision if they ever cross the path of my animals I\u2019m gonna have to do what I have to do. I\u2019m not loosing countless of dollars and animals over piss poor dog owners. I know this comment might get a lot of hate but it\u2019s the truth. To deny it is pure ignorance and if the problem isn\u2019t going to stop it could very well eat you out of a farm/home. You could try to go to local police but if they are anything like around here they will just turn a blind eye which leaves you with 2 options. Have everything killed and destroyed on your farm, or take matters into your own hands.",

A few took the snare wire home. \nBefore that I set out poison bait and a few others stopped showing up.\nI try to always keep a rifle on my back when out on the farm.\n\nI also raised fowl in the same manner.\n\nThe three S's are the country folk way.",

We had a dog, but she was smaller than the mutts here, so that same morning we went and picked up a LGD that would be bigger than any of the untrained dogs around. She's loud, he's huge, it's a good combo. No new dog attacks since he hit maturity.\n\nOur land had been vacant since the 60s so people had just let their dogs roam wild on it for years. There's a lot of forest and natural water, with many deer, rabbits, and grouse that the dogs were hunting. We basically had to train every dog within two miles to stay away, as only one neighbor put any effort into keeping their dog home. \n\nIn this area I think it's a matter of no one ever neuters/spays, so there's so many extra dogs and not enough money to feed them that no one actually seems to care when a dog goes missing. Puppies are dirt cheap or free because there's too many around.",

As soon as I see him walk towards the side of the house I go out and tell him to get back here. Because I worry that somebody else isn't going to know that my dog's okay around their cows and horses. I also don't want him and other people's yards because it annoys the hell out of me when other people's dogs come in my yard. I also hate dogs that chase freaking cars. This seems to happen a lot in farm country.\n\nOne other thing I hate about farming country is people tend to think they can drop off their animals that are unwanted out here. I think they figure oh these people are farmers they will want extra dogs.",

We started walking the road and found out the fun way my one more distant neighbor was letting her German Shepherd and some other type of very large fluffy dog (almost looks like an all-black 80lb Shitzu, whatever that breed is) out without a leash, no fence and apparently no electric fence like we and my direct neighbors have. Black one came running out off of their property and onto the road every time we passed taking a walk, and the one time the German Shepherd followed it too. It listens to me when I get stern with it to stay back and go to its mom but her dumbass keeps on saying \u201cHe don\u2019t bite\u201d as if that makes it ok.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen them since October when we stopped walking because the bridge was finished, but last Sunday I was walking home from my grandparents and it did that same shit. Came running out onto the road, and I even switched to the far side of the road too thinking it\u2019d be less intimidated, and it still came within 5 feet of me. Same thing, got told \u201cHe don\u2019t bite\u201d as I was on my third time telling the dog to go to its mom. And honestly I got so pissed at her I told her outright \u201cI don\u2019t care, I will defend myself.\u201d and of course *that\u2019s* when her meek ass finally got the dog under control and back into her yard.\n\nGranted it doesn\u2019t bite, and that 5 feet was the closest it\u2019s ever gotten to me, but I know 4 people who\u2019ve been attacked by dogs and I\u2019m half convinced to just shoot a warning shot with my .22 in front of it the next time to scare the shit out of it.

I can get 6 lbs of butter and 6 lbs of cheese weekly plus having milk to drink. 16 lbs of cheese weekly would be very easy, but I don\u2019t have the time to dedicate to so much cheese. We have 100 lbs aging already.\n\nWe\u2019ve kicked around the idea of getting dairy sheep too.",

Famously calling it greenland to lure in colonists despite it basically being one big glacier with a few small areas that are habitable but with extremely rough winters.\n\nWe've found a few of those settlements and we've found they had a pretty extensive cattle pens and barns.  I always thought it was a bit strange and probably not worth the time since the cow would only have a few months to graze.\n\nBut I get it now.  16lbs/week of cheese per cow is insane.  That would give lots and lots of calories that can be stored for the winter.",

I know 108 of you on r/homestead already do.\ud83d\ude05\n\nso I\u2019d like to take this time to give you some back story on who my Great Grandma was. As mentioned to another Reddit user, her name was Darlene. Born in upstate New York in 1910. The last year of \u201cThe Lost Generation.\u201d Thinking back, as a 31 year old Millennial. She was a living museum. The last of the Lost Generation and a millennial in the same room sipping on some apple juice, me intently listening to her stories. That\u2019s how I grew up.\n\nShe recalled her earliest memory one time. Their neighbor gave them a newspaper and she remembered seeing a big ship on the front page. Her father and the neighbor began a pretty serious and sad conversation. \u201cNewspapers back then were bought by one and shares with many, this one was when news broke about the titanic sinking.\u201d Darlene was 2.5-3 at the time. A very early memory, the only part that really stuck with her was the picture of the big ship on the paper.\n\nDarlene outlived her husband. To ensure the family homestead was kept by my family, she never remarried and she and her children kept the homestead alive. She had 12 children. 8 boys 4 girls. Anytime her father was mentioned (my great great grandfather was mentioned which was often as I loved hearing all the homestead stories). She would get emotional due to all the back breaking labor that he suffered through. [Jordan Peterson said it best.](https://youtu.be/bMOEWhPgR6Q). Darlene died 6 months after I graduated from high school (2011)  at 101. Two months short of her 102nd birthday. My father is the current owner of my family homestead, as his 6 other siblings sold their share of the inheritance to him.\n\nI\u2019ve been on this subreddit for a while, At least 1 year. It\u2019s been a pleasure thus far.I\u2019ve had several fantastic interactions. Even if some of my comments have been nuked into the ground.\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 As always though, I extend an invite to everyone to PM me with questions and problems. While I don\u2019t know everything I do my absolute best to answer using the wisdom i received growing up.\n\nThe cheese recipe, while May just be instructions on Reddit has been feeding my extended family for 100 plus years. I know it will serve everyone well who follows the recipe.\n\nYou\u2019ll see the recipe 6/6/23 in the afternoon CST!\n\n\n\u201c ***UPDATE III*** \u201c will be the recipe",

                            "comment": "***UPDATE III***\n\nDarlene B\u2019s Goat Cheese Recipe!\n\nNeeded:\n* 2 gallons unpasteurized goat milk\n* Cheese culture \n* Thermometer \n*  Normal strength rennet \n* Cheese cloth\n* Calcium chloride ( great grandma never used this in her brine, but grandma started, and now I do too.)\n\nNote: I wax my wheels out of habit. However, ive been told that it\u2019s unnecessary.\n\n\nRefrigerate two gallons of freshly milked goats milk overnight prior to use.\n\nPour your refrigerated milk into a large pot and heat milk until it\u2019s 95 degrees F. Immediately remove from heat and add 2 \u201cfingertip pinches\u201d of cheese culture to the milk. Make sure to spread the culture all around the surface to reduce the risk of the culture from clumping. Wait 30 seconds to allow the culture to rehydrate, then stir the milk for 1 minute. Cover pot and let the milk rest for 1 hour. At the 1 hour mark, your pot of milk should be around 88 degrees F.\n\nPut your pot back onto heat, while maintaining 90 degrees add 7 drops of rennet. Stir milk for 1 minute, then cover. Pot should remain on heat for 1 hour and 90 degrees maintained. After 20 minutes you should notice the milk start to thicken.\n\nTest firmness once the hour is up. If it\u2019s not firm, wait an additional 15 minutes and retest. If you notice your whey is clear and curd is too firm cut back on the rennet by 1-2 drops next time. This varies depending on the season and what the goat is eating.\n\nClean your sink out and prepare a warm water bath for your pot prior to cutting curd.\n\nWhile On heat Cut your curd vertically and horizontally. \n\nHorizontal cuts take practice. Smaller curd produces dryer cheese.\n\nRemove from heat and place pot into water bath. Wait 5 minutes to allow the curd to sink to the bottom of the pot. Do not allow temperature to fall below 85 degrees. \n\nAfter 5 minutes begin lightly bottom to top stirring while the pot is in the water bath. \n\nOnce the curd is  free floating, put back onto heat and quickly bring back to 90 degrees. Continuous stir for about 30 minutes. Curd needs to firm up just a little bit. \u201cNot Mushy, firm but still soft.\u201d You may need to stir for an additional 10 minutes.\n\nPick a curd out of the pot and squeeze it. Curd should have a little strength to resist a light squish. \n\nRemove from heat and drain most of the whey from the pot. Store the whey for future baking.\n\nPut your cheese cloth in your pot and transfer curd into your cloth. Cloth the cloth, pick it up and squeeze until a minor stream of whey is dripping. Put your cloth and curd into a form and then into your cheese press.\n\nPush your press down using about 1/4 of your body weight and lock your press. Your press should be over your sink to catch the whey. \n\nLeave the form pressed overnight at room temperature.\n\nBrine should be 1 gallon of water, 1 tsp of white vinegar, 2.5lbs of kosher salt. (Optional) Add a squirt of calcium chloride.  This brine should be used multiple times. Store in a cool area, stir before use.\n\nRemove wheel from the press and the form. Let wheel float for 2-3 hours depending on weight. Yield varies depending on the season. Heavier, float longer.\n\nAfter 2-3 hours take out the wheel and let the wheel sit at room temperature for 4 days before dipping it in wax.\n\nLet the wheel sit for 2 months before eating, longer is better however.",

One of the biggest things i've learned is that there is a point of diminishing returns in chasing a style that is not native to your place, so i mainly make the styles that are easiest to reproduce in my cellar, with my milks, and with the starters i have available. So my recipes aren't likely to be optimized for you, but i can type some out if you really want them.\n\nIt helps to remember that salting heavily, cooking the curd hot, and cutting it small make harder and dryer cheese with longer aging times, and vice versa. For rinds and affinage, if you do nothing you get brie/camembert rinds. If stored cooler, slightly dryer, or slightly saltier (like in a fridge) you get blue. If you want something different you have to wash or soak at least until the microecology you want develops. For reds, brevi develops with a saline wash, i also like a good oil rind like manchego.",

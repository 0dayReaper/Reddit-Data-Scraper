So I would like to build a more reliable list of YouTube channels (and other resources) that I can refer to when I need help.\n\nI live in Gippsland Australia, and am just beginning my homestead journey. If there are any specific channels/resources to the area that would be great, but I'm keen to find any quality homesteading resources that you trust.\n\nRegards.",

            "comment": "A few of my favorites include:\n\nHomesteady - they seem really grounded and give good advice, while addressing the realities of homesteading\n\nNature's Always Right - Not a pure homesteading channel, but great for what it is. The guy who runs it started out as a permaculture channel and has transitioned more towards homesteading content. I think the thing I like the most about his channel is that he always seems to have a fresh perspective on a lot of things\n\nHomegrown Handgathered - Again, not pure homesteading, and more directed towards foraging and suburban life, they also have some ingenious ways of doing things. \n\nEdible Acres - and agaaaain not pure homesteading, just really great at fresh perspectives and getting me to think of working with the land rather than against it\n\nGreg Judy - the GOAT when it comes to regenerative AG and animal husbandry\n\nAndrew Millison - more permaculture, really focused on water conservation methods. \n\nDr Elaine Ingham - the GOAT when it comes to soil science. A buddy of mine took a course of hers like a decade ago and had me watch [this series](https://youtu.be/ErMHR6Mc4Bk) when I was first getting into gardening. It completely changed how I view soil and land management",

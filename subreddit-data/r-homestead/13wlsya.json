This course sounds like more of a summer camp for like minded adults to learn cob while making some friends. Before I was a homesteader, the idea of this would be fun - but honestly now, I can't afford to pay over $700 for something i could learn for $5 from a book, and can't spare the time of being away from the homestead, since there's so much that needs doing",

I live in Tn and have wanted to for years and while videos and books are nice I\u2019d like to have the workshop hands on experience in case any hiccups come along. This is awesome! I\u2019ve wanted to build with cob for over a decade now!",

I am the host and will just be paying for all the supplies. If I had the experience to teach it I would just ask for volunteers. I think this company is able to spread the idea of cob building all over the world because they charge students which otherwise wouldn't be feasible. I think they have alternatives to the tuition as well. Feel free to investigate more.",

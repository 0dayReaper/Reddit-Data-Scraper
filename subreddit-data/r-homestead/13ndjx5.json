            "comment": "This is Calder, Tasmania, Australia.  \n  \nI think it\u2019s one of the best places in the world to homestead.  \n  \nI\u2019m 10 km inland from the coast, 41 degrees South, lots of nice beaches and a big maritime climate influence.  Winter temperatures rarely drop below freezing, and summers rarely hit 30C (Zone 3 Australia).  Rainfall is 1500mm per year and the soil is fertile red volcanic.  \n  \nWe have a North facing slopes for maximum passive solar  (Southern hemisphere remember!) and sea views at the same time.\n  \nThe bird life and wildlife here are epic.\n  \nA town, supermarket and an airport are 15 minutes\u2019 drive away, and it\u2019s 75 minutes flight time to Melbourne.\n  \nWe can collect and use our own rainwater in Tasmania, solar generates all our power needs except in winter, wood from the trees which fall on the block provide our heat.  We don\u2019t have property taxes here at the moment (you pay a sales tax when you buy a property), but the local council charges rates of  $850 per year (in Au$, between $500 and 600 US).  \n  \nTasmania only has a population of 540,000 and it\u2019s pretty spread out so some services are not available or a long way away, but that\u2019s part of the charm.  It also takes ages to get here from almost everywhere!  \n\nEdit:  Forgot to say grid electricity is almost 100% Hydro/Wind.",

Excess should be given back to the tax payers in the same proportion as it was taxed. Until additional items are approved. Nobody should be giving government a blank check to spend how they want; this is what leads to corruption.\n\nAnd you may like a government that tells you how to live, how to educate, what you can eat, takes money from some people to give to others on a path to full socialism but I don't want that. If you want to live in that society, that's fine but you don't get to decide that for everyone in the world.\n\nThink of it this way, lets say the government comes over and takes your house, says \"hey, we need to reallocate this to some homeless people, it'll be better for everyone. You can afford to rent a place so you'll be fine\". It's the same mentality just exaggerated.\n\nWhy should someone who does not live a healthy life be given free healthcare when they utilize 10x more resources than someone who is not obese/smoker/drug addict... Where does that sort of mentality stop?",

But, I'm sure you'll cherry pick some response related to just firearms and ignore the rest because it's the most controversial with the most talking points that you can parrot.\n\nPretty sure AU is one of the places that bans raw milk, homemade food sales, no Psilocybin which helps stop addiction to thing like prescription opioids(can't have that now can we) and proven to help people with depression, etc.\n\nI look at it this way, as long as I'm not hurting someone else or doing damage to their land, property or person why does it matter what I do on my own land and what decisions I make?

I think the entire idea behind homesteading is the self sufficiency and providing your basic needs from the land so you're in touch with it all; so I imagine everyone with their homestead feels the same way and 'one of the best places' is a matter of opinion. My location may not provide a variable spread of crop and game in comparison, but I'm just as happy when I can produce what I do, is that not the beauty of it?",

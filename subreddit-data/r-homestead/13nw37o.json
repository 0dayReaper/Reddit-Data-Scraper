    "postText": "We had 4 chickens as of this morning. We\u2019ve had hawk attacks before but have put netting up over their run to protect from that. Came back from a morning hike and only 1 chicken is left unscathed. Found the carcass of one that only had the spine / rib remains and feet left. That has since been removed but the other two birds are no where to be seen. 3 of our birds had white feathers but one had golden brown and I don\u2019t see any of her feathers in the pen. My other white bird may be missing / escaped because it doesn\u2019t look like enough feathers for 2 birds. What animal would attack like this? Hawks in my experience won\u2019t eat a whole carcass and just eat the head. Raccoons seam to just kill chickens for sport, and I feel like a dog wouldn\u2019t have eaten so much of the carcass and let the other birds run away. Any ideas?",

If you don\u2019t shoot a predator they\u2019ll keep coming and clean out your flock. I\u2019m sorry about your loss. Either the other birds are hiding and might return or have been taken and given to pups in a den close by.",

Feathers come out when a bird is fighting to escape a predator -- you won't get a trail of feathers when something is carrying a non-struggling bird. \n\nThe exact location where you found the carcass will tell you a lot about what kind of critter was eating it there. \n\nWhat sizes of critter could have gotten into their enclosure?",

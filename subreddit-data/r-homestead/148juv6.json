They are partitioned off so that they don't spread. We get an over abundance of raspberries and they are very easy to care for.\n\nWe also planted golden raspberries which are the sweetest...but they didn't grow as well.",

This summer is an unseasonably cool summer in the 80's....\n\nThey're easy to manage. We planted them in a small section of yard. We don't really fertilize them. We just cut them back in the fall and then when spring comes they grow to be like bushes and fill with berries by summer. These are suppose to fruit in late summer...but as you can see we've already gotten so much fruit...for a few weeks now. I think they fruit earlier depending on the climate. Apparently raspberries can grow in zones 3-10....so find out what grows best in your area and go for it!",

And in a cluster some are more ripe than others....the over ripened ones fall off and are almost purplish. You can tell the ripe ones because they are a deep reddish color and they come off easily. The ones that aren't that ripe have a lighter color and don't easily pull...so I leave them on.\n\nDifferent varieties are colored differently...but you get familiar with your plant quickly. We planted golden ones on the ends of our row...they didn't do so well. It is a little confusing when we get a few of those berries because they might appear to be in un-ripened Caroline variety...but after close inspection, they are smaller and more delicate. They almost come off the branch crumbly when they are ripe. The gold ones are the best because they are so sweet it's like eating candy.\n\nFor some reason, we don't get that many pests altogether...we have been lucky...but I think that they are prone to aphids. We have different varieties of basil growing. We have mint, tomatoes, oregano, etc...and we keep those separated from the raspberries. I think that there are certain plants that you aren't suppose to grow near raspberry plants because of the pest issue.\n\nI don't even see that many birds eating them...maybe they do...but there are plenty of berries for them and my fam!",

I'll never know for sure though, because I'm at least the third person to get a small amount and propagate everything from that one free bucket of suckers.\n\nDo your berries also start crushing under their own weight almost instantly?  (Basically the opposite of grocery store berries bred to maintain their shape for shipping).",

They are not as delicate as the golden ones we tried to grow. I basically don't pick them unless I'm going to eat them within a day because they spoil quickly. This variety produces a lot of fruit so I just pick more when I get hungry. They are suppose to produce in late summer but I've had lots of berries for several weeks.",

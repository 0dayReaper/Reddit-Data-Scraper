The world\u2019s resources are limited and so is my income. Lots of people want to own land along the coast or in the mountains or in the forest or where the weather is nice or where there are other natural resources. Nobody is making more land, though, but we are making more people. So, we all need to temper our expectations and square them with reality. I\u2019ll never be able to afford my ideal spot, but homesteads work just fine with cheaper land where I live. It\u2019s literally the main reason I live here.\n\nI\u2019m not telling people to not be in poverty. That\u2019s an intentional misstatement of my position. I\u2019m only pointing out that alternatives exist which are much more affordable. Grandma didn\u2019t survive with a 10 acre spread in Jackson Hole.

One is necessary for survival the other is the most luxury vehicle on the market there is no comparison bc no one will die without a Ferrari but people die every day because they have no shelter. I never mentioned owning land in nice areas. I specifically mentioned outside of nice areas, in fact I mentioned completely undeveloped lots in the middle of the wilderness so cool strawman;). But even if I had mentioned nice areas the point does not change. Shelter is a necessity for people to live it doesn\u2019t matter where you were born you should not have to move 3 towns away to find affordable shelter. \n\n&amp; you can make as many disingenuous arguments about grandma not living in nice areas as you want plenty of peoples grandma\u2019s lived in the cities &amp; none of those properties are at all comparably priced anymore either. \n\nAlso real estate is not a \u201cscarce resource\u201d there\u2019s more empty houses than homeless people both in America &amp; Canada.

Assuming a 1lb loaf takes a pound of wheat to make (depending on how much sifting you do when making the flour); that means it takes 20sqft (0.0005 acres)to make 1 loaf of bread.\n\n We go through 2.5 (call it 3 to pad it) loaves a week, normally (2adults, 1 3yo). That means we need 60sqft of wheat, per week to have bread. 52 weeks, that means we need 3,120sqft (0.072 acres) of wheat to have bread for the year. Call it 0.1 acres (4,356sqft), so we have extra for malting, flour for other things (besides basic bread), and for next years seed.\n\nI harvest mine with a sickle (haven't gotten around to making a grain cradle for one of the scythes yet). Threshed with a homemade flail, and winnowed in a cardboard windowing tower with a cheap squirrel-cage fan. \n\nWe also grow small (less than .1ac) plantings of flint corn, oats, rye, 6row barley, lentils, Chickpeas, black beans, and dry peas for our own use.",

I honestly broadcast by hand most of the time. I have a large nylon satchel, which can fit about 20lbs of covercrop mix (it'd be more full of wheat, but I've never needed to fill it for that). I prepare the seedbed, and then split my seed in half. I then broadcast one way through the entire plot, then grab the other half, and broadcast the entire plot 90 degrees to my first pass. I have found it helps distribute the seeds more evenly. It takes some practice broadcasting by hand, and you have to keep your form as consistent as possible to keep the spread even. I then go over it with a steel-tine leaf rake to incorporate it. \n\nAs for weeding, the few broadleaves that will compete with the wheat are pretty easy to spot in the plot, and I go through and pull them every week or so. You can walk on it sparingly up till it starts to form the heads, so it's not that bad to go through it (a hour or so every other week is usually plenty adequate for me to do what I plant). I usually side dress with a little liquid fish+molasses at least once (twice if time allows) during the season. The biggest time expenditure for me is harvesting and threshing, which I can generally get all done in a day. Milling is to be done within a day or two of use, otherwise the germ will start to go rancid.",

Washington State University has a bread lab in Skagit county working on that project and baking breads and goods with the different grain varieties. Some of this has the side benefit of helping those with gluten intolerant enjoy grains again with the different varieties. Interesting project, and this may be an avenue you want to run down in the future.",

Then, as an alumni of WSU, I read about the project in the Liberal Arts publication they put out (since recycled that magazine.) And then there was Wazzu Nation out of Ocean Shores public radio which did an interview (caught a bit of it from another fellow alumni, and was \"Yup, read and heard about it.\") So maybe Wazzu Nation is archived somewhere and downloadable and from there a link in the interview or name gets you in the right direction?

If you look at most great depression recipes, they're heavy on grains/starches and short on meat (because meat is expensive, and if you're raising meat then you can also _sell it._)\n\nAnd, people were doing this even in cities. People in cities kept gardens. Many cities converted public areas into space for neighborhood crop gardens and spaces to raise chickens. Reverting back to a more local, simple supply chain wasn't _only_ possible in rural areas.\n\nEDIT: I see people are responding with family anecdotes of terrible hardship. Yes, some people had virtually no income. However, many families had SOME income ... although their pay had basically been slashed in half (which would be a financial catastrophe for most people today).",

Talking about home canned food - last year my husband had to keep her from eating peaches that were put up in 1976.  Looked like turds in a jar, but that crazy woman was going to eat them.  She can\u2019t throw a damn thing away, and even saves trash like egg cartons and cereal boxes.  She turns 88 today, and is the proud owner of 2 houses and 3 buildings full of literal garbage.  It will be up to the kids to clean it all up, but they aren\u2019t capable. \n\nLike anything, being able to sustain yourself is ok in moderation.   But when you make your kids wear rags to school and eat shitty food so you can stash cash under your mattress, you\u2019re a sick person.  Also your kids don\u2019t want to clean up your fucking mess when you die.",

People lost multiple harvests to the dust bowl, farmers gave up their land to travel thousands of miles for jobs they might not even get. People waited in bread lines, lived in slums, and ate canned food surplus from the last world war, previously thought undesirable, now the main option for food with the amount of failing farms there were. \n\nIt got so bad, the government stepped in with robust subsidies for farmers if they grew bulk cereals like corn, wheat, and soybeans. Subsidies that still exist today, and are the whole reason big agriculture still produces such massive surpluses of these crops in America.\n\nSo no, grandma didn't farm her way out of the depression. No farmer did. Even farmers who kept their farms in this era we're receiving significant government subsidies to do so. The idea that the economy no longer affects you so long as you grow your own food is completely false. Unless you never use money, and never trade by any other means, you are a part of an economy, no matter how \"off grid\" you think you are.",

That weather system broke more communities than the Wall Street crash ever could have. \n\nI produce a lot of stuff myself. Dad (75m) texted me last month a price on ibuprofen. I have seeds started for several plants that based on experiments last year cana step in for Pepto Bismol and headache meds (I have 1 drug that is completely necessary and as long as society functions I\u2019m not using a plant with unknown strengths in place of my antidepressants. And used the more powerful OTC drug option when I got say the intestinal infection that put Mom in the hospital for nearly a week). I garden, I sew, and preserve, so a lot of the things I use I \u201cmet\u201d when they were seeds or fabric yardage or whatever. Usually the lines above work. \n\nBut the Depression had as a major factor a *lot* of farm failures that were for reasons fully out of the control of the farmers. Grandma had like 10 younger siblings at home and went through many dust storms. You can\u2019t breathe during those, really (dust fine enough to render cloth masks ineffective). And after the kitchen garden is once again toast. Great Grandma needed to can 600 quarts of produce for the winter and she couldn\u2019t grow enough food. (One reason my mom\u2019s first sentence was, in a store, \u201ctoo \u2018pensive?\u201d because that was what one said in a store at some point) \n\nIt\u2019s not safe to depend on the global or national supply line, but regional crises can and do take out entire towns.",

The Dervaes family grows over 400 species of plants, 4,300 pounds of vegetable food, 900 chicken and 1,000 duck eggs, 25 lbs of honey, plus seasonal fruits throughout the year.  \n\nFrom 1/10th of an acre, four people manage to get over 90% of their daily food and the family reports earnings of $20,000 per year (AFTER they eat from what is produced).   This is done without the use of the expensive &amp; destructive synthetic chemicals associated with industrial mono-cropping, while simultaneously improving the fertility and overall condition of the land being used to grow this food on.  Scaled up to an acre, that would equal $200,000 per year!  \n\nTo follow the Dervaes and their Urban Homesteading activites, you can find them at http://urbanhomestead.org \n\nUrban and near-urban farming can be highly productive, causing whatever size of land you have to work with to produce with more abundance.

Where do they come from?\n\nYou can't pull 3 tons of produce out of the ground year after year without replenishing nutrients.\n\nThere's no way they're self-sufficient without intensive fertilization. You can recapture a decent amount with obsessive composting and mulching, but unless you're also growing with humanure, you've got a big leak.\n\nMy (cynical) guess is that the reason they offer workshops, consultancy, and rent their space as a venue in addition to selling their harvest is that their input requirements are *high* and organic fertilizers aren't cheap enough at scale.\n\nTheir produce margins must be razor-thin. They also built all of this over eight years?! What was their startup cost? Was this guy independently wealthy going in?\n\nColor me bitter and skeptical, but this whole operation rubs me more as \"rich old hippy passion project\" than \"model for modern sustainability\".",

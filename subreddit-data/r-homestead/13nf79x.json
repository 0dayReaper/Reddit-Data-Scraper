The Salt Brush, Russian thistle and other bushes are the only things holding the sand down. Until you correct the \"soil\" these bushes are you or your SO's bestie.  Anything you clear out will take decades to regrow without your help.\n\nAlso, a note about soil correction, the closer you are to Sand Dunes National Monument the more basic the soil.. ([There is a Ghost Town at the base of the monument that existed in the 1890's that used to mine baking soda from the top soil](https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=160687)).",

I have more in common with the city government of Mosca or the Mennonites in down in Waverly then the county commissioners up in the county seat.\n\nIt's knee jerk reaction on my part.  Recently we had an eminent domain issue in my little community.  I have enough pocket change to get myself a lawyer.  But most of my neighbors ended up **paying the Alamosa government** $500.00 for 1-2 acres of land to be taken from them to become a county road.\n\nYes; that is NOT how eminent domain is supposed to work.\n\nHave you talked to the building inspector yet?  LOL whole other can of worms.",

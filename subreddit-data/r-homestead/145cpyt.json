    "postText": "Does anyone have sheep? I guess there are two types (hair sheep &amp; wool sheep?) and if you don't sheer wool sheep they can get all sorts of nasty things [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/c0vARJPE2D8](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/c0vARJPE2D8). Curious what those of you who have hair sheep do with them? Are they just for meat &amp; milk or can you use their hair in some way?",

Good hair sheep completely shed, while worse genetics may not shed everything (usually on the back) and may need that sheared off once a year. They are meat sheep, but exceptional animals may be used for milk on a rare individual basis.",

Outside of Australia and Asia, the wool is actually a burden because the wool industries in Europe, USA, and Canada pay so poorly. They just cannot compete with Australia, China, and India when it comes to wool. So temperate/hot sheep growers are increasingly going to hair sheep and not bothering with wool at all. \n\nYou will still find wool sheep in cold/damp places like Canada, UK, and Scandinavia. Hair sheep are generally in hotter places.",

Cost me around $60. My mother in law makes things out of the wool (she made me a cap that I only wear in the winter because it gets to damn hot in the summer). \n\nMy brother on the other hand shears only on rare occasions. Every spring the dorpers shed like a dog and look scraggly for a month or two. \n\nHis are solely for meat, while I use our for meat and wool.\n\nEdit: one thing I forgot, he claims that the hair sheep have far less lanolin and thus have less of that mutton flavor. To me the taste has more to do with the age they were harvested than the breed.",

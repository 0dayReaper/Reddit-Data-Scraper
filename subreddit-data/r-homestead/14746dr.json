    "postText": "Question for everyone. My wife and I came across 7.5 acres that we really want to purchase because it borders our land. It is a bit pricey and with the purchase and cost of operation to break even we'd need to gross about $20k-$25k /year. What is the best way to do that on 7.5 acres?\n\nWe've thought of your general things like niche cattle for selling sides of beef, eggs/chickens. Blue berries grow here as well as black berries. This is in eastern Oklahoma. Any input is appreciated.",

Once you take into account hay for winter and building fences you might only make 10% return on investment.\n\nNot sure of your capacity per acre but a lot of places can do 1 cow per acre. So 5 females and selling their off spring each year would probably be your max. But unless your gonna AI them a bull and 4 females is max but then got alo of hay cost into that bull. Other areas might only hold one cow per 10+ acres due to poor pasture/grazing area.\n\nMight be able to get into a niche market with some mini cow or show cows for looks but unless there is a known market you might raise a herd of highlanders and find out that is no longer popular or lacks a premium price by time they are done. \n\nSome kind of organic micro gardens might work out but would require a lot of time. Maybe could do a U pick it kind of thing but blue berries and other such things take time. Then the liability of folks roaming around your place and at a certain point you made a place for others vs yourself.\n\nSorry to sound a bit negative as buying land that next to you is always a good move but it is gonna be tough to pull that much per that kind of acreage. Might talk to some high end farm to table restraunts maybe you could grow them certain things and get an idea of the market before buying.",

A small ranch might be able to do better on some things. But would probably be a hobby farm vs ranch. Say if they had 30 acres and 5-10 cows and let a larger farming neighbor cut hay on most of the land and they would split the hay. Then they might be able to get by without a tractor.\n\nNo tractor payment gets them a bit better return on investment but also they don't have any tools to expand. But enough to kill a cow a year and split between family and sell a few calves for feed or fence repair money",

That's going to be extremely difficult for farming unless (or even if) it's your full-time job.\n\nFor example, my net profit on a dozen eggs is about $1.25 if I ignore labor, delivery, and packaging (which is reasonable in my case because I meet my customers at places I'd be going anyway, they return their egg containers for re-use, and I call the labor a wash given that the chickens help with waste disposal and tick removal). If I wanted to net $20k just from eggs, I'd need around 900 hens and 300 customers buying 1 dozen/week. At that scale, I could probably get feed cheaper in bulk, but I'd also need to start factoring in packaging, delivery, and labor. I'd also start needing some food handling permits (well over cottage food law limits where I live), which means I'd need commercial refrigeration and cleaning facilities, which in turn means higher costs, and I'd need a plan for flock turnover beyond 'incubate a couple dozen in my living room in the spring, replace the rooster every couple years'.\n\nSelling cuts of meat requires USDA facilities that are licensed for that (there's a reason most small setups do 'cow shares', the butchering requirements are less stringent).\n\nBerries and other perennials are an option if you want a u-pick setup, as the ongoing labor will be minimal, but again you're going to really struggle to net $3k/acre, especially once you factor in parking space.",

            "comment": "We operate a plant nursery on about an acre of our land and net about $20-25K each spring. Our main expenses are nursery pots and well-draining potting soil. My first year, I only made about $5K and spent most of that on stock plants, but quickly shot up during the next two years. We propagate most of our own plants by seed, cuttings, and divisions. If you decide to do this, do your research about licensing, plant patents, and noxious weeds.\n\nThat's enough to pay our property taxes, utilities, and general living expenses. It's not enough to pay for healthcare. I still keep my day job (fortunately, it's a work from home situation).\n\nWe also have a large garden, lots of fruit and nut trees and bushes, and chickens, which helps with food expenses. We also live fairly frugally, so we keep costs pretty low.\n\nWe could make more by selling plants online, selling produce and eggs, selling non-timber forest products, growing and selling cut flowers, or starting a u-pick. Personally, I think we could make bank starting an outdoor Crossfit-type thing where people pay us to \"work out\" in our garden and orchard.",

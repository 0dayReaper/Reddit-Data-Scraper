    "postText": "Title is a little weird. I could use some help in how to explain to our roommates that they're not going to \"make money\" homesteading, at least not any time soon.\n\nFor context, we rent out half our home at an extremely reduced rate to a young family that's struggling to get by. They have two kids, wife doesn't work, husband does.\n\nWe live on 20 acres, and we have a cider orchard, and don't mind if they use the land for various things, and we're helping out with a lot of it. So together we've made a garden and gotten chickens (you can take a guess who financed most of this).\n\nI don't mind doing these things. I'll enjoy having quality eggs, and nice produce, but I am under ZERO assumption that I'm going to \"make money\" doing this. I can afford to put money into these projects, and I don't expect a full return on that. \n\nAs it turns out, roommates are extra struggling because the husband has taken time off work to work on the garden and chicken yard. He thinks it will \"pay off\" eventually when the chickens start laying, he's going to \"sell tons of eggs\". We had to explain to him that no one is \"making money\" until the infrastructure is paid off, and that's going to be a pretty big hurdle. Not to mention chicken feed. It will be awhile before this project is even cost-nuetral.\n\nThere will be some savings in regard to food costs. Problem is, they qualify for WIC and EBT, so I don't even know if they will be \"saving\" any money this way.\n\nIs there any way to talk some sense into them? At least just explain that it doesn't make sense for them to be struggling to pay bills and taking time off work for this? I'm not just being pessimistic here, right?",

Just have it all written out, explaining the cost of the infrastructure, and general monthly cost to keep the chickens fed, etc. I think they are vastly over-estimating how many eggs they'll sell and for how much, but maybe this will at least put things in perspective.",

AKA freeloading until there's more sunlight.\n\nOther things people tend to not consider like the cost of cartons.  What are the state requirements to sell the eggs?  Some places need them washed and packed and refrigerated in an approved facility to be sold.  Other states you can stick them at the end of the driveway in a used carton from the grocery.  But even used cartons from the grocery only last so long before you need to start buying them.\n\nAnd that's all assuming no major losses to predators or illness or extreme weather or a heat lamp burning down the whole coop.",

Do they need to be insured?\n\nI'm not expecting answers, since the answers will be different for each business. I'm just trying to illustrate just how many things need to be considered. I mean, this is just a quick brainstorm of possible obstacles, it isn't even a complete list:\n\n* Who will buy the eggs? How will you reach them -- is word of mouth enough, or will they need to advertise? Would the market support prices high enough to cover *all* of the costs?\n\n* How will they handle complaints? Would they lose their customers if the eggs aren't perfectly smooth, or if the yolks aren't the desired color?\n\n* Are they allowed to sell things from home? (Vancouver BC's zoning restrictions can turn this into a nightmare.) What is the dollar limit before they owe taxes?\n\n* Will they need a business license? If so, will they need more than one license in order to cover all of the locations where they wish to sell?",

If they have eggs and produce that's taking out two of the most expensive food categories right there. Many people on EBT can't afford to buy a lot of vegetables and consequently often their diet is lacking in nutrition. \n\nYou definitely do have to make them realize this isn't a side hustle in the sense that it will make money for them but a side hustle in the sense it will save them money or at least improve their quality of life at the same amount of money spent.",

The main people I see making it are youtubers, which is a completely different profession, just their topic is homesteading. Or they're somehow selling at double + the grocery store price. Both of those take a certain personality type and the ability to sell yourself, not just the products.",

We have a rental agreement, but we will consult a lawyer and see what they say.\n\nI'm 33 years old. I'm not retiring until I'm 67? It might be a later age by the time I'm there. I started saving for retirement at 26, so I'm hopeful about using that. My husband has a pension. The house isn't part of our retirement plan. We never wanted to bank on that. But, I also can't see the future. We have life insurance policies and all that fun stuff if something goes wrong. \n\nThe renters are like 2 years younger than me. I have hopes they're not going to want to just live here until we're all ready to retire. The husband is going to be making full-scale pay at his job come November. It's part of the union contract, my husband works the same job, so his income will double in November. Will they be able to save and move out like they plan to? I guess we'll see.\n\nI do appreciate your concern, and I really do understand it. I don't see how it would hurt anything at all to have a lawyer look things over for sure, and sounds like the right thing to do right now.",

It's possible a lawyer will say something similar, in regard to how tobset this up so no one gets taken advantage of.\n\nIf you're going to go the bank account route, then what you might want to do is set up a company with you and renters as equal partners. Make it an LLC so that no one is personally liable for anything (that means should something happen where a lawsuit is involved, no one's personal assets are at risk of being taken/sold for settlement). Make it so you need your signature AND theirs (one or both, your choice) to use any of the funds in that account, for any purpose. This does mean that no one gets a debit card, but everything paid by cheques/wire transfers instead.\n\nThe land where the chicken coop/garden/anything else is that is being used: write a contract stating you personally will keep ownership of said property/land, and are leasing it to the LLC that you create with the renters. This protects you from losing that land thru any sort of squatters rights, or use of land rights, or whatever might be applicable in your area.\n\nWhen constructing the LLC, the assets you've put into it (the money you've spent on financing everything) should be listed as assets brought in by you, and, should the LLC dissolve at some point, those be returned to you, or the sale of such goes directly to you. This way you don't have to be repaid by your renters for it, but you still get your investment returned at the end of the endeavour. You can add a stipulation that it needs to be in the same condition it is now, or better, to prevent any potential for damage should things go very bad (worst case scenario).\n\nI'm sure I could think of more, but that should at least get you started in the right direction.\n\n(Source: am accountant)",

That's honestly the #1 reason everyone should have some sort of home-based business, and why a homestead that can make *any* income (read: income is not profit in the accounting world, and losses can be carried forward and back, with limitations I won't get into here) should be registered as some form of business for tax purposes, if nothing else.",

I've done this with my daughter who liked to think she would \"make money\" by selling $20 of stuff that I put $30 into. Is there a market? What's the going rate for a dozen eggs? Are there any regulatory requirements you need to address (license, zoning, business insurance) that incur expense? How many eggs do you get a day (better, a year since the rate of laying varies)? How much does food cost for that unit time? Do all the math and tell me the projected profit? (if it's below zero, that's a big problem!). And, if you want to get a *realistic* cost, how much did the shelter cost &amp; what's a reasonable amount of time over which to depreciate the expense? Even if they're looking to \"save\" money with homegrown stuff -- how much does it cost to build a garden area? How much are you spending on seeds, tools, etc? If he's taking time off from work, that's an expense too -- say even an hour a week at $15 an hour from May through September adds up! How much do you actually spend on veggies in a quarter? How much of that will actually be produced here? Do the math, and how much was *really* saved? Again, if that number is below zero? You're not saving money!\n\nOur daughter was really surprised to learn that a lemonade stand only made money because she was supplied lemons and cups. She was even more surprised when I showed her how I calculate some actual cost for the \"free\" honey from our apiary (it's never too early to learn generally accepted accounting practices!) so she could add that in as an expense line item.",

First off infrastructure is expensive to set up. Fencing, coops animal shelters and feed and equipment storage space (barns/sheds). That brings up another expense, equipment. First are the small things like hand tools, a lawn mower, chainsaw, shovels rakes and cordless power tools. Then there are the big toys like a tractor and the attachments to go with it. Things like a brush hog, tiller, post hole digger, and plows. Some of these you can get by without and there may be ones I didn\u2019t mention that you will find you can\u2019t get by without. A side by side or golf cart is worth its weight in gold. And there is maintenance and repair on all of this equipment. \n\nWe sell eggs, baby chicks, full grown chickens, full grown rabbits, goat kids and some goat dairy products. We also sell pickled quail eggs and some canned food products from the garden. Things like cowboy candy and jalape\u00f1o jelly.  You need to know the local laws and market before you start selling any of these things. \n\nWe are to the point where about 60 of the food we consume comes off our property. What we sell does a little more than cover the cost of the feed for the animals. We save money by not buying as much meat and fewer vegetables from the store. I will tell you it\u2019s a lot of work. It take us three days to butcher and fully process 8 rabbits for the freezer. But we don\u2019t just throw rabbit parts in the freezer. We make ground rabbit, rabbit sausage and rabbit burger patties. \n\nEven if your operation pays for itself you still have other expenses like insurance, electricity, fuel and food items you can\u2019t produce yourself. My pension covers these expenses. I have a lot of neighbors who run respectable size cattle operations. Several hundred acres and over a hundred head of cattle each, and every one of them has a job in the city. Most of the time I see their kids out running equipment after school. And I see dad running equipment after dark sometimes. Small farm operations are not a way to get rich. They are a lifestyle.",

Maybe in a few years but certainly out of the gate. \n\nWe do turkeys.   We have a stupidly high number of them.  They grow up and sell for a hefty price range per head.  We have sold several birds so far.  Usually what happens is the cash I got turns into cash to purchase more - feeding a cycle of growth.  This doesn\u2019t happen overnight. \n\nI have sold enough turkeys to almost pay for the first turkeys we bought.  It doesn\u2019t cover the infrastructure to house them, not the cost of feed.  Maybe in the next year or 2 that balance will come (it\u2019s headed that way).  This is only 1 project of several on our homestead.  Most other projects are not this successful.  \n\nEgg sales are finicky (chicken egg).  We sometimes have buyers and sometimes we don\u2019t.  I would NEVER use egg sales as a stable income stream.  It\u2019s more like icing on the cake (hence the old term \u201cegg money\u201d).   I don\u2019t really see much to be made even hatching and selling pullets (we do this too).  \n\nWhat homesteading DOES do is fill your freezer if you want.  We have filled ours for about the same price as premium meat purchases at the grocery store.   Since that\u2019s the premium meat prices you are not saving money there but you do get to know where your food comes from.  That why we homestead.",

            "comment": "You can make a living farming, but it takes a lot of hustle and multiple enterprises. \n\nMe and my wife raise pastured pork and Joel Salatin style pastured meat chickens to sell at farmers markets every Saturday of the year that is above 38 degrees Fahrenheit. \n\nWe profit $15 a bird and about $550 per pig.\n\nWe have also picked up two local grocery store contracts and hope to get more of those in the future. \n\nWe also sell our excess eggs and vegetables at the farmers market when we have them. \n\nI still work full time as a corporate schmuck for our primary income, but we have built the farm up over the last 3 years to a profitable side hustle, netting about $20k a year of profit.\n\nHowever; you *cannot* make a living *solely* selling eggs at a homestead volume. \n\nEven if you are able to profit $2 a dozen (not likely) you have to sell 10,000 *dozen* to profit $20k a year. That's *120,000 eggs a year*. Chickens don't lay every day either. \n\nThat's $20k a year to pay mortgage/rent, insurance, utilities, groceries, etc. It's not enough.\n\nAlso - how many chickens will you need to produce that many eggs? A good laying hen will do 200-250 a year. So you are going to need at least 480 chickens. Also, the highest volume layers (Golden Comets come to mind) live shorter lives. So you will have to replace them every 3-4 years.\n\nFinally, having a large supply of eggs is one thing. Selling them is another. Simply having the eggs to sell doesn't equal sales. \n\nWhat are you going to price your eggs at? What are other farmers pricing theirs for? What is Walmart pricing theirs for? And why is a customer going to buy *your* eggs instead of someone else who has them cheaper, or who has been in the game longer? \n\nIf you are going to sell 10,000 dozen eggs a year, that's about 193 weekly customers that buy 1 dozen eggs a week, without fail. Where are those customers coming from? How are you going to get in front of them? \n\nOh, also - if your profit per dozen is only $1, you're going to need to double all those other numbers. To get to $20k of profit. Which is not enough to live on. \n\nAll that to say - I am pro homesteading. I do believe it can be done for profit. My family is proof that it can be profitable. I am a massive Joel Salatin fan, and I believe in local food systems. \n\n*But* (and it's a Kim Kardashian sized one) you have to run it like a business, just like any other business. If you can't answer these business plan types of questions, you are going to fail. You have to have a realistic plan for how your business is going to be profitable.",

If the revenue alone doesn\u2019t scare them, figure out how much they spend each year on operating costs (mainly chicken feed, but anything else that they have to spend money on as well) and subtract their costs from their revenue.\n\nYou may not be able to get through to these people however.

There\u2019s a person we know that has Bi-Polar Disorder &amp; he\u2019s always getting into these \u201cget rich quick\u201d schemes when he\u2019s off his medication. \n\nA church we used to go to had a Good Samaritan Program. If you qualified, the church would pay your electric bill for 3 months. The only stipulation for this was that you take a financial literacy class that they put on for free. They start by having you sit down &amp; list out all of your bills &amp; what each of those cost. Then they would write down their income &amp; a counselor would explain net vs gross income. From there they would explain how you don\u2019t need the super premium cable package (or insert whatever unnecessary thing you like). They had a packet of free things to do in the area if you were interested in entertainment. 9 times out of 10, the adults would have a lightbulb go off in head &amp; they would cancel or stop unnecessary spending that they hadn\u2019t realized were hurting them so much. That last person though\u2026whoo! Those folks were a different breed. They don\u2019t want real help, they want everything their way for free. \n\nHave your tenets done anything like this? Could you sit them down &amp; help them navigate smart spending vs silly spending? This conversation would be more broad strokes than the specific homesteading conversation that also needs to happen. \n\nLastly, I think you also need to give them a heads up about your long term plans &amp; be frank about how things will go. \n\nI wish you the best!!",

Get 20 clones and huge fabric pots and have the dude spend all summer and fall watering and pruning and then cure, trim and bag it up in the fall and you will see some money. \n\nChickens and produce? Lol. Everyone in the country is flush with eggs and produce in the summer.",

People are going to do what they want at some point you have to absolve yourself of the responsibility. You sound like a nice person but I would seriously question whether this is something that impacts you enough to keep trying to talk sense into them.",

On the north side of a year round stream, with a gentle slope uphill to the north and riparian rights to said stream. About 5 to 10 miles inland from the ocean, close enough to not need air conditioning yet far enough to not experience too much fog. A good clearing surrounded by a mix of old growth oak and madrone. Some redwoods down by the creek would be nice. \n\nIf money were no object, I\u2019d probably move back to that area for a mix of weather, recreation, culture, family, friends, and familiarity. Since I can currently only afford to camp along the coast, I live in the desert, which I also love, but it certainly has it\u2019s challenges.",

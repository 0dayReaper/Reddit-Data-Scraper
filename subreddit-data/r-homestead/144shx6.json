    "postText": "We have this pear tree in our yard that I've been excited about, but there seems to be something wrong with it. The leaves in certain sections just go brown, and almost seem like they're being eaten? \n\nThere has been a bit of a drought the past couple weeks but I saw some of this before as well.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what this might be, or a good place to start looking? (Since we didn't plant it I'm not sure exactly what breed of pear it is.)\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Looks like fireblight. Pears, at least the old cultivars, are usually good at walling it off so it doesn\u2019t kill the tree. Best thing would be to either:\n\n1) What I would do is leave it, and then in late winter when it is still very dormant, prune out all of those blighted shoots well below where the tissue has blighted. \n\n2) prune it out now, well below the point of blight (like 18in below). You have to be extra careful not to spread the ooze if there is an active infection because the bacteria can infect any damaged tissue it comes in contact with. Wind can even cause outbreaks. \n\nHot and/or wet conditions the most conducive to spread. You can spray a copper or antibiotic periodically during bloom or bad conditions to help. All kinds of good extension information out there. Good luck.\n\nhttps://treefruit.wsu.edu/crop-protection/disease-management/fire-blight/",

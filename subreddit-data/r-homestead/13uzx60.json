Once there is blood, they will all start pecking at her wound. If you can get to a tractor supply or similar type store they usually have great antibiotic sprays for hens and anti-pecking goos you can use.",

Went through something similar recently and my girl did bounce back after a week or so, but, sadly, I've also had to make the other decision in the past as well. Culling is heartbreaking, but sometimes the most humane and loving thing we can do for them.\n\nWish I could offer more help. Hopefully you can get in touch with a vet tomorrow.",

If it\u2019s not diluted enough, it\u2019ll give her diarrhea but as long as you can get her to eat and drink she should heal up if she wants. Adding water to the food so it\u2019s like a mash should encourage eating and if she\u2019s not eating on her own you can use a spoon and offer it to her that way. I usually keep some [healing music](https://youtu.be/xpzh8FRuh8k) on for mine to relax them as well. The wound may need some antibiotic spray from the feed store if you can get your hands on it",

Get some red Gatorade; chickens are drawn to peck at red, and it has sugar and electrolytes to help stabilize a little. If she doesn't drink it, take a spoon, put some on it, and dip the tip of her beak. She should be forced to take at least a little",

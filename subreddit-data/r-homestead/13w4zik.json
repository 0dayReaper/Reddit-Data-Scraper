    "postText": "I have a few acres of forest I\u2019d like to make more enjoyable for camping and hiking. The forest floor is very uneven, with old stumps and fallen trees in various stages of decay, and the floor is covered in several branches, leaves, etc. There are also large rocks lying around. \n\nMy goal is to thin out a few of the trees, particularly the evergreens, so more light can come through, and even out the ground so it\u2019s more walkable with a camping area. \n\nI believe a drum mulcher can help thin the trees, and lay the mulch on the ground to help with the soil. I\u2019m not sure how deep, if at all, it\u2019s safe to put the drum mulcher into the ground to deal with stumps and fallen trees, or if rocks could badly damage the drum mulcher. \n\nI believe a root rake can help pick up the large branches in a pile to burn or also mulch. \n\nI\u2019m not sure of the safest way to even out the ground, which as far as I can tell is years of fallen trees and decaying stumps that have been covered by debris. \n\nAny thoughts or advice? Would like to do it myself with a rental or possible purchase of a skid steer or tractor, as paying someone on this size parcel (plus necessary upkeep) seems to be cost prohibitive. \n\nThank you",

It\u2019ll be beautiful.\u201d And I always have to tell him that it\u2019s already beautiful the way it is.

It's meant to have texture, decaying timber and rocks. That decaying timber is supporting an entire ecosystem of critters, plants and fungi. Remove it all and you'll have an arid wasteland in short order.\n\nTrying to tame the wilderness is where we've been going wrong for so long!",

    "postText": "I have an electric mesh/netting fence that came with plastic posts (for Agra den to keep out rabbits and raccoons). I added wood posts at the corners to help give it support. 0.5 joules. Around 160 ft perimeter. \n\nI read on another form that you need to use plastic insulators even with wood posts. Is this true?? I thought wood touching the posts would be ok- not a good conductor.",

            "comment": "We used insulators.  But we were also doing 2 courses of single strand, not the mesh.  So for us, the concern was that between tension, wind, and general movement it might either dig into the post or loosen and perhaps make contact with the ground.  Plus we weren't sure how rain or ice on the post with a bare wire might behave and for what the insulators cost, it was just easier to go on and use those.",

            "comment": "If using the electric netting, maybe try to position and attach a 4-5' PVC pipe against the wooden post to separate the netting from the post. \n\nLikely, when dry the netting would be hot, but when wet, may short out without some kind of insulation between netting and post.",

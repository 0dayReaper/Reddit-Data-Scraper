    "postText": "Hey guys!\n\nWeird question, I suppose lol.\n\n I was wondering, if I were buying calves to train myself, what is the best option:\n\n. A pair of bull calves - I assume they would the the strongest combination but they eat a lot and when there is no work they can't do much else, unless I offer them for breeding services (oxen teamsters around here tend not to castrate bulls) or offer them to work for someone else (some folks do that where I'm from).\n\n. A pair of female calves - Wouldn't be as strong, I assume, but I can have them bred. They couldn't work when heavily pregnant. My greatgrandfather had a pair of cows.\n\n. A single bull calf - Can one ox carry out all the work? Plus I've heard that a single ox is hard to retrain to work in a team.\n\n. A single female calf - Has its benefits because of production but I'd be worried about the workload. \n\nThoughts? Experiences? Any places that might have more information on this, or places I could ask?",

            "comment": "Oxen, like almost all ruminants, are social animals.  Don't get just one.  I can't help you with oxen specifically as work animals but I can give some general large livestock advice.  Where are you and what are your winters like?  Are you doing several acres of silage and/or hay? Do you have experience caring for and feeding large livestock?   These are huge animals and you need a good sized pasture even for a couple or they will repeatedly break out of even good fencing.   You probably need up to two times that pasture in row crop or hay production for winter depending on where you are, otherwise these will eat you out of your wallet. \n\n Be very careful thinking about large work animals as a cost effective alternative to mechanized farm equipment.  It's awesome to want to do this the old way as long as you understand it will be harder and more expensive, but I just want to make sure to point that out cause I have seen people get large livestock and completely overwhelm themselves.",

Now we have some smaller animals but also a pair of horses that my siblings own and train, recently for work too. I make and repair tack for them. My parents owned and worked horses for years and my grandparents worked with oxen when they were young. Its just that there were some situations a few years ago and I'm trying, with everyone else, to bring the property back up. We make our own hay, we build wooden sheds and stables with our own lumber, have tons of pasture land.",

I get nervous cause sometimes people on here move from the city onto 5 acres and think they are getting into work animals cause they can't afford mechanized and that is a recipe for disaster.  Good luck with your ox experiment my wife eventually wants to try the same but I am pretty partial to my John Deere lol.",

But yeah, the work includes hay transport from far away fields, some on bad terrain. Logging, transporting firewood. I have animal-drawn plows and fields they'd be perfect for so there's that too. Also some general transport around the place. As for breeds, in my country the Simmental is by far the most popular, followed by Hereford, Holstein, Charolais...We have our heritage breeds, one of which is specificaly developed for work and very poor both as meat and milk animal.",

They have a buddy with them all the time that help with the needing to get back to the heard. I think if you were to do a single animal you will regret it in the end wish you had done a pair.",

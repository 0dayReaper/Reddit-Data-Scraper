    "postText": "1. Skinning the carcass with anything other than the sharpest knife is much more difficult than I thought it\u2019d be. This is the first animal I\u2019ve processed and I\u2019m going to get a knife dedicated to doing this.\n\n2. Finding the scent glands was kind of impossible - I didn\u2019t see a single one, so I prepped it for the dogs. I\u2019m not trying to eat musky meat, but they sure will!\n\n3. Hang the animal by it\u2019s hind legs to skin it. Using a table to skin, especially without anchoring, is really creating more work than necessary. The dang hair just stuck to the meat like glue - no matter what I tried I\u2019d find new bits of hair on the meat. Skin in one area, once the hide is off then move to a table to butcher. Save time and better quality. The shoulders and hips were chunked up and cut up because I struggled skinning.\n\n4. I shot the groundhog and I will say, it was a very humbling experience. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to even try the meat - i felt off. I wouldn\u2019t consider myself a picky palate and I\u2019ll try a lot. I\u2019ve eaten groundhog, squirrel, geese (tasted like sweet revenge). Nothing makes me queasy in regards to any physical body (I work in healthcare), but killing the animal and butchering it just made me, well, not able to eat it. I don\u2019t enjoy killing things, I don\u2019t like harming other creatures. This little critter bought the farm because he wouldn\u2019t stop eating the garden, and I didn\u2019t want to make him someone else\u2019s problem. I\u2019ve been conscious of where our food comes from and how awful it can be for the animals (and us), however, this process seriously made me consider vegetarianism for a minute. Knowing the horrors of mass production, I didn\u2019t blink twice at a package of ground beef. But one little groundhog and I\u2019m eating lentils and curry. I am looking forward to owning hogs, and I will try my best to butcher them myself, but maybe at first I\u2019ll ease in and pay someone to do it for me.",

Maybe sick? I've had a few hunters tell me something the animal ate can make it smell wrong, so maybe that was the problem. Down side of hunting is you don't know the animals health and diet. But the farm cats were very happy to have fresh meat in their bowls!",

I don't enjoy killing (I mean if I did there'd be something wrong with me) but it's orders of magnitude less suffering for the animals than supermarket meat, and between those two things that's what's reduced our household's meat consumption considerably.\n\nI've found that skinning a groundhog carcass with high quality poultry shears by making little snips right between the skin tissue and the muscle was much more effective than more conventional skinning techniques. This way you get off the glands and 90% of the fat as well, which can hang on to any musky smells if you nick a gland -- but if you don't there's really nothing bad about the meat. After that we let it rest for 3-5 days in the fridge before freezing for a week.\n\nGotta admit, though: Groundhog is *delicious* if prepared like pulled pork in a slow or pressure cooker, or twice ground for sausage. It's like a darker rabbit. But I suppose in the end rodent is rodent.",

I never shook the feeling that I was doing something a little wrong, and it always felt bad to end the life of an animal. \nAnd it's a good feeling, because it helps me always avoid unnecessary suffering and never to take an animal's life unjustly. When I killed an animal to sustain my own life, it was done with thought and care. \n\nBeats picking up some poor factory farmed pig that spent its entire life suffering. Same goes with killing rabbits (or groundhogs) that eat your veggies. Don't let the meat go to waste, and you're sustaining yourself through the necessary death. Even if the meat goes to a working dog, or in a pie or sausage, or even to fertilise the garden.",

They're extremely alert, though, so I have yet to be able to get a clear shot. We'll be eating it whenever I can get it, though. It looks a lot like a big squirrel so I'd butcher it the same way.\n\nAs to your #4 point, I've harvested better than 80 squirrels, several rabbits and 2 pekin ducks for meat and I have 6 chickens on deck that I will butcher in about 3 weeks. I know exactly where you're coming from with the consideration of vegetarianism as I have considered the same many times. As far as I am concerned, that is how it should be. I should be constantly revaluating whether I am willing to do what needs to be done in order to have meat. If I am ever not willing to do it myself then I know that I will need to go vegetarian at that point.\n\nRegarding your desire to do meat pigs, I will say that killing an animal for meat while hunting (or pest control in the case of groundhogs and squirrels) is a completely different experience than harvesting an animal that you raised. Like not even in the same realm. I had a very hard time with the ducks, personally, and they were far from the first animal I killed for food. I raised them from tiny 4 day old ducklings and, despite my best efforts, had become somewhat attached. To then restrain them and cut their throats and feel the blood pour out over my hand (I had to hold their heads down while they bled out because I didn't have a great slaughter set up) was so much more difficult than shooting any number of squirrels from a distance.",

Just like a rabbit, quick circle with the knife around the ankles top and bottom, and neck and yank, pulling it off inside like a tshirt. It's harder than a rabbit, and you'll need to slide a knife around as you go, but the same method works, and limits that pesky fur on meat. \n\nMy favorite skinning knife is this little curved pakistani fixed blade knife I picked up from a rummage store,  very sharp and I use it for all my skinning.\n\nI hit one with my truck last winter, and waste not want not you know? It's pretty nice fried tbh. \n\nI do rabbits weekly, but it also works on raccoons, groundhogs, prairie dogs, and squirrels, almost exactly the same way.",

About $1.50 per month or 5 cents per day.  For a well that's not super deep (200' or so) assuming you pump 1,000 gallons/day with a 1kw pump @ 10 cents/kwh. Not sure how much a house uses but 1,000 gallons per day should cover several normal houses",

Plus there's a spike on start up at about 12 amps.  Add to that a pressure pump and I believe the power usage is not trivial.\n\nEdit:   I've been putting off exact amperage measurements and this thread will motivate me to go and check for certain.",

Less than half the power of your microwave and running only a minute or two at a time depending on the size of your pressure tank. \n\nPeople claiming that running a well pump for a house costs real money in electricity better show their math, because it isn't possible unless you're using oceans of water or paying crazy high electric rates.\n\nYes the pump draws significant power but it's only on for a few minutes per day, not hours. It fills the pressure tank and shuts off until the tank gets low.",

Kicking in $10 each isn\u2019t so bad. He said it goes up in the summer as his wife does a lot of watering. Kind of annoying part of sharing a well since I don\u2019t water my lawn but I imagine it\u2019ll still be affordable.",

Honestly have no idea because he just tells me it was $20 and to give him $10 and that I can see the bill if I want. I think I glanced at the first one but have not really been sweating $10 a month so haven\u2019t looked since. Will definitely check at the next one and try to remember to come back here.",

The electric came off of my parents' house,  and it was quite a bit more than $1.50.  So dad had another well drilled for just their house and cut the electric to the shared well.  Yes, he could be petty and I inherited that trait.",

We do have a contract that requires us to split maintenance cost, just not sure what to do with usage cost. We do have the option to install a second pump and run our own power, but we would be looking at close to 10k to set it up. \n\nI wonder if there is some sort of meter that can be installed on the pump to track usage?",

    "postText": "Looking for advice for out sow in labor, this is her first litter. She had some discharge around 9 last night, we checked back in around 11 and nothing. Fast forward to 4 am this morning and there was a piglet but was stillborn unfortunately. She seems too be not in distress but uneasy? Not sure how too describe it. I feel we should get the vet here but have found conflicting things online. One said 8-12 hours of labor and others say 30-45 mins any advice would be helpful. Thanks in advance.",

Remember, there are 2 placentas and once the first one passes, there are times where momma will take a break for a bit... and ive seen up to a couple hours, which is long.\n\nIf you see that she's had an excessively long labor period and is still trying, but nothing is happening... its time to glove up and get in there, especially if shes a Gilt.",

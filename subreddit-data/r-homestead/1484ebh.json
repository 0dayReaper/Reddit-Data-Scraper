I\u2019ve seen some lift over 30 feet! \n\nIt\u2019s not a heavy flow, but reasonable to get a gallon or 3+ per hour; or 24 to 74+ gallons per day! \n\nTakes some work to set up, but it\u2019s a project to tinker with.

Why spend money to half ass it?\n\nbut for the first bit, I mean personally I'm only in my fifties and I've got a herniated disc which acts up kind of randomly. I would be okay with picking up and putting down 50lb water jugs no problem 90% of the time but there would be days when I really don't want to do that, and days when I can't. Sometimes several days in a row\n\nRight now I'm in the city but I'd like to spend more time on a bit of bushland I have up North. I think I can still do it but I have to plan ahead. I'll need help to get set up I think running water in some form is a must. Have a plan in mind in case you hurt yourself or put your back out I guess, that would be my suggestion.

I made the buffer from those trees instead of from my buildings. Supposedly not as fire safe, though.",

They are almost always a total loss. Bad wiring (many off-grid places aren't up to code) or failures in electrical devices is often the cause, but embers from wood stoves and fireplaces are frequent culprits as well.  \n\n\nFire is probably the biggest threat to a place like this. Numerous fire extinguishers should be on hand and every potential source of flame should be accounted for and mitigated.",

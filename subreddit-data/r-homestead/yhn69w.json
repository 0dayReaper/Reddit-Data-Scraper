First we fermented garlic scapes and hot peppers, then when the fermentation was ready  added in some vinegar while blending to taste, and then canned it. I\u2019m pretty sure canning kills all the good and bad bacteria, so it kinda sucks to kill those beneficial dudes, but we had so much of it we had to do something to preserve it. There\u2019s a few jars in the fridge that weren\u2019t canned and we\u2019ll eat those first.",

For venison, we freeze the good cuts like blackstrap and roasts, but the trim we use either for a mixed pork/venison sausage and/or canning. You just put the trim pieces in the jars, pack, seal, and pressure can. The canner cooks the meat and it ends up in a bath of its own juices. The silver skin just melts away under the pressure, so it\u2019s nice that you don\u2019t have to spend any time on that. The meat turns out super tender, great for Mexican dishes, pasta, or anything that uses shredded meat in the recipe. I like having some canned meat around for when I don\u2019t have the forethought to set something out from the freezer to thaw.",

I just started my journey to being sufficient as a family unit this year and put up as much as I could but mostly of sauces and soups.

Since the rings keep the lid on, the seal can release but re-stick, and you don\u2019t know if your food is still safe to eat. \n\nThis is also why you shouldn\u2019t stack cans on top of each other.

I did add/move the shelves so the jars all perfectly fit. I added shelves by finding scrap wood pieces, cutting them to size for each shelf, and to hold the weight I added 1x2s or 2x4s or whatever I had drilled into the bookcase frame. You can see the supports under the higher shelves along the left-hand side.",

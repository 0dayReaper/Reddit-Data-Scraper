    "postText": "Disclaimer: I'm a suburban homeowner who knows nothing about gardening/homesteading but I'm eager to learn.\n\nI recently dug up \\~300sqft of lawn to put in more drought-friendly landscaping. Right now all of that dirt and dead grass is sitting in a huge pile in my backyard. I'm considering putting it on Craigslist for free to anyone who wants it, but I'm also trying to \"close the loop\" in terms of my inputs and outputs. So if I can put all of this organic material (is dirt even organic?) to use in things like garden beds, my worm bin, a compost pile, or anything else, I'd rather do that. I would assume the dirt is very nutritionally poor but I don't even know how to tell that.\n\nSo, my question: is there anything I can do with hundreds of pounds of dirt, or is it simply trash I need to dispose of? Thanks!",

    "postText": "2 years ago I bought a river lot that was overgrown, full of trash, and came with a meth lab.  \n\nI\u2019ve hauled dozens of truckloads of junk out, cleared acres of brush with an old 8N tractor and chainsaw, bought the neighboring property with an abandoned cabin that we\u2019ve brought back to life, added a couple food plots, and had a WHOLE lot of fun in the process.\n\nI recently bought a new subcompact tractor that has made life a lot easier and this summer we plan to relax.  It\u2019s been better for my mental health than anything I\u2019ve ever done.",

Since we\u2019re both fat if the water is too choppy it\u2019ll come over the side of the boat and we just go lower and lower\u2026. \n..\nWe don\u2019t set trot lines no mo \ud83d\ude06",

You can get them cheap from Amazon under the name space balls - no, I'm not making that up.  They hit about hard enough to dent cardboard. \n\nNon-lethal, but between  the sting and the noise, they are effective for hazing.  I mostly have raccoons and I can tell you they do not like it.",

I've never been hit with a paintball so I can't say what that feels like either.  Does marking a critter with paint keep it from coming back?  Don't know.  Also, there is less sound from a paintball gun.  When these go off they make a pretty good boom and when they hit, things get moving.",

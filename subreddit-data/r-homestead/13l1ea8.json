A better option is to use a waterproof breathable material, like building house wrap aka tyvek. this will stop rain but still allow moisture inside to get out. When you buy high quality timber or siding it will be shipped wrapped in this material for that reason and you can overwinter in it. you can buy rolls of this stuff actually much cheaper than tarp also.",

You can lay a tarp underneath but I probably wouldn't because it'd pool on that tarp longer than itll take the ground below to absorb it or move it along and you only have wet logs on the bottom layer. Then looking at your setup, I'd string one end of the tarp to the fence and stake the other into the ground and it makes a lazy lean-to type roof",

Biggest thing is getting it off the ground, I'll use some scrap lumber or even a few large limbs to keep it raised slightly off the dirt.\n\nTarps are good for keeping the rain off, but if your firewood is still slightly green, tarps limit the airflow around the wood and can slow the drying process. I'd just get it off the ground and leave it uncovered if it's been recently cut. Right now I'm splitting some logs that a neighbor has had in his field uncovered for the past two years and it's all in good shape.",

A bonfire (that mostly throws heat up and away from the ground) is not going to be an efficient way of reducing the moisture content of firewood.\n\nFirewood that is left near the ground and moist is already being 'burned' by fungus that eats all the useful calories and leaves you with punky, rotten wood.\n\nWe don't know how fast OP is going to cycle through the wood they have, so we have to assume we need the safe storage option they asked for.",

Not a huge deal, but it was super annoying cleaning it up.\n\nA neighbor of ours got fancy and bought a giant Costco kennel - the kind where you can easily put three or four giant dogs in it comfortably - threw a tarp over the top and the sides and secured it down with some kind of cheap metal roofing.

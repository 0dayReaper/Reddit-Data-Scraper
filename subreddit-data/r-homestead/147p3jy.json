    "postText": "I live in a rural area and get a normal amount of mice getting up into the house (after going under this exterior crawl space door flap, then into the basement and finally up into the under-kitchen sink area).\n\nThere are plenty of 1/2\u201d gaps in this current setup that allow mice to get in. Any ideas for a better, crawl space \u201cdoor\u201d system that will make it more difficult for these critter to get into the home in the first place? \n\nThanks everyone",

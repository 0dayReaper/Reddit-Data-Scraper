Has anyone experienced something like this on their property?\n\nWe always know they are around, and we are cautious, but are there bad years for ticks and better years?\n\nWe've been considering using chicken's or guinea hens to help eat them up and if course trimming trees and long grass.\nAny thoughts?",

Spay/neuter them so you don't end up with a massive collection of the damned things, and they'll help keep your mouse/mole/vole population down hugely. Which will help with your tick/flea/etc population as well. \n\nIf you have dogs/cats keep up with their flea/tick prevention... stuff.

I have a LOT of experience removing ticks from myself and my buddies. Burning always seemed ineffective and, for the love of god, do not use your fingers to squeeze them off. If a tick is carrying Lyme and you squeeze them, you just pushed their innards into your bloodstream. The best way I've found is to take the finest angled needle tweezers that you can find, place the edge directly up against the skin, clamp down on to their suckers, and pull away perpendicular to the skin. Most of the time, this will pull away clean. Sometimes it'll break one or more of their suckers in your skin, but your body will push that out within a few days, just like a splinter.",

You tick check every evening and after going out in long grass or in the woods you just shower and wash clothes ASAP, also taking a shower after gardening/working outside makes sure you dont get chiggers (we use soap with essential oils), I found that LESS clothing was best with ticks as you can see them on your body pretty quickly, also if you have to go in the woods in seed tick season you bring duct tape, so you can  get em off quick. What is rough is when your small children get covered in seed ticks, YES this has happened to me, cue me spending hours with a headlamp and tweezers. Also another good tip is to keep bentonite clay on hand, if you get bit and its on for a bit then just make a thick paste and apply it to the bite, it sucks out the diseases from the skin.",

They are however seasonal.\n\nMowing your lawn will help a lot instead of leaving tall grass \n\nCheck your body thoroughly before going to bed. They live to crawl into arm pits and ass cracks. As long as you get them before it's engorged which takes about a full day after biting, then it won't have transferred any disease \n\nIve pulled  dozens of ticks off but never one that was embedded because they first walk around on your skin and i always notice. More likely that you won't notice them bite while you're sleeping. \n\nDo NOT let your dogs get in your bed, they will drop ticks and bite you while you're sleeping whe you least expect it. you're almost guaranteed to get bitten by a tick eventually if you do this",

I'm from pretty far north and did not see my first tick until I was 19. I had no idea what the hell it was. Fast forward 20 years and they are on everything.",

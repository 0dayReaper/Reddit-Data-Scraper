This is probably in combination with excessive pressure from animals on the more desirable vegetation.\n\nThough it's annoying, you should be working with it. It's trying to improve soil and site conditions. This doesn't mean you can't kill it and get rid of it, just that you try to work with nature and move your property to healthier conditions. Finding ways to reduce compaction, get animals off the property for a time, establishing native species, not mowing.",

    "postText": "I own land in South Texas and am planning on moving out there within the next year. The property runs along the border of two counties. As I was looking at the parcel lots online, one of the maps shows a pipeline that runs directly through my land. \n\nI will need to get a well out there and was planning on building my home. Based on the map, the pipeline runs directly parallel with the land. \n\nAre there any extra precautions I should be taking or anything I need to consider when planning? What I\u2019ve found essentially says the pipeline would need to remain accessible so I wouldn\u2019t be able to build over it. My main concern is the possible effect on the well water and overall condition of the soil. I am planning on getting more information but am currently limited due to being out of state. \n\nI own the mineral rights and the land was inherited so an easement likely went through my family but I had no prior knowledge. \n\nThanks for any help!",

You can have well water tested to quality if you're concerned. They have access rights for the easement. If the contract isn't on file with the county clerk you could try contacting the pipeline company and ask for a copy and see if they'll send to you. \n\nWhat does the pipeline carry?",

I\u2019ll be contacting the pipeline for further info, but as far as I know our land doesn\u2019t currently have any markers, fencing, or been accessed within the past few years by the pipeline. There was a partition among family members and it seems like no one knew about it.",

We just use it to cut some hay right now. If I wanted to fully fence it, they would come and mark the spots for fence posts on their ROW or fence it for me and add a gate. They accessed the line once 10 years ago and retopped my gravel road and asked if I needed any money for loss of hay. Like I said, good stewards",

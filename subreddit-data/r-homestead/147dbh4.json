Sure, less cows and chickens and pigs would die. But what of the ground nesting mammals? What of the crickets and birds? What of the acres of land that is unsuitable for farming, but useful for grazing that would then be wasted?\n\n\"Monoculture agriculture is the problem!\" In some cases, I agree with you! In many, it is the only alternative to mass starvation. How many *individual human lives* are you willing to quietly sacrifice, while you sit here and nitpick people who are trying to pull themselves out of the system?",

Ie you'd litterally die if you don't eat that chicken. Since we can all easily survive without eating these animals I consider stuff like this killing for fun.\n\nIf the world would move over to vegan farming we'd be able to reduce agricultural land by 75%. So there would be way more options to integrate remaining land into nature and move away from monoculture farming. \n\nAnimal farming is just way more inefficient than normal farming, if you'd really want to live independently this would be more like how we lived before the industrial revolution which involves eating a lot less meat and only killing them at end of its usefull life.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019m considering a property for the future and came across something that\u2019s about 600 acres and virgin land. I was wondering if any homesteaders could point out some chores/maintenance/hurdles or anything to think about on a large property. It\u2019s in mountain farm community. \n\nAlternatively for the same price I can get 60 acres with some infrastructure on it. Ready to live and make a side income from air Bnb. What would be the challenges here. \n\nIn both cases it\u2019s a pack up and move to the country side situation. All in. Just looking for things to consider so any ideas will be great. Thanks in advance.",

If you can afford that kind of land, I\u2019d say get to work learning EVERYTHING about understanding and managing that kind of land. For example, do you know anything about invasive species mitigation? If you aren\u2019t willing to do that, buy the 60 acre farm. Soil survey maps and environmental history are your friends. The good farm land is most often already being farmed cuz ye know, we\u2019ve been here a while. Don\u2019t be that person who buys a vast forest and hardly knows the organisms living in it, hires an evil logging company that comes in and wreaks havoc of a centuries time scale, scarring the land with erosion and poisoning the waterways all in a vain attemp to tame lands that someone else chose (often with good reason) to leave wild.\n\n600 acres would be glorious if you are someone who would rather be alone in the woods all day than amongst the human world. If you aren\u2019t that kinda person you\u2019ll probably be happier buying a small farm",

On 60 acres you could live in the existing house while you built your dream house.  We live out of a tent or our van.  It's not great.\n\nPlus you have to consider getting utilities to the raw land.  If it's remote enough, you'll have to do solar, wind, or water.  And that'll depend on what the area is like.  Is there enough wind for a turbine?  Enough solar even for winter power?  Enough water or is it a seasonal river/creek?\n\nAnd, finally, you say it's a mountain community.  It can be hell putting in a well on a mountainside.  If there's a lot of rocks/bedrock to get through, it could be very expensive to get a well vs already having a water source at the existing structure.  Same with building.  It could be very expensive to build a structure on a mountain parcel, depending on the \"soil\" composition.  It can cost a lot more to drill/anchor into bedrock than loamy soil, ya know?\n\nSo I would just consider things like that.  When we were shopping, we did the math on \"would it cost more to buy an existing house or bare land?\"  In our unique market, raw land is so cheap, it almost always wins.  But in most other markets, that point is basically a break even or cheaper to get something with a structure.  You can just find land for $500-700/acre near us so it's very hard to justify spending on an established property when you do the math.  But having a finished house is certainly a time saver.  lol",

The rest is for personal enjoyment and creates a nice buffer between us and our neighbors. We pretty much let nature do it\u2019s thing on the remaining 55 acres. When we bought it it had a double wide, electric, a well and septic, plus a tractor shed and work shop. It only cost about 20% more than a 60 acre place that had nothing but a very old small house, more of a cabin and the same utilities next door. We looked into getting a land line (phone). That alone would have cost $8,000 to have installed. \n\nThere is no such thing as too much land as long as you can afford the taxes. But having utilities installed can be very expensive and new home construction ain\u2019t cheap. I just spent $3,000 having my leach field upgraded. Not the septic tank just the leach field. It really comes down to what you want to do with the land and what your financial resources are. One thing to keep in mind. If you buy 60 acres that\u2019s all you will probably be able to get. There are several tracks of land adjoining mine I would love to buy 5 to 20 acre parcels. All of it is wooded and on a fare grade. None of its good for livestock or farming. But the owners are absolutely NOT interested in selling one square inch. We have a solar company trying to buy some land here and nobody is selling. And they are offering 3 to 5 times market value.",

    "postText": "Who here has built there own houses on their homestead? What was your experience with it? I've been thinking about going this route, but I could see a TON of stuff going wrong, so I'm curious to hear about other peoples experiences. My rough plan is something like this:\n\n\\-Buy blueprints for a house that fits my criteria (nothing fancy, a bungalo with a basement, that kind of thing). From what I've seen, blueprints can cost a few thousand dollars if you want the CAD files, I'm curious if there's a cheaper option available.\n\n\\-Work with a contractor to do the foundation, framing, electrical, and roof (I'm pretty handy, but I really wouldn't want to screw up these particular items). \n\n\\-Do the interior work myself, hopefully save a bit money. \n\nPart of me just wants to buy a pre-fab home and put it on a concrete pad, but it would be pretty satisfying to have something that I know will be suitable to my wants and needs. Any info/insight would be appreciated.",

Could have done it cheaper but they are pimp inside. \nThought about framing a foundation out but quite frankly it was just me and I\u2019m kinda like u. I\u2019m handy but framing a building takes preferably three people with my skills. \nI\u2019d suggest buying a shell or buying a \u201ckit home\u201d if it\u2019s just you. The kit homes gets real nice nowadays. Kit home or framing ur own would require you to have everything measured out as far as plumbing to lay a foundation.",

            "comment": "My husband and I are building our own house. We currently live in a camper. It's a slow process. We started out clearing brush and trees, then we used a tractor bucket to level it out to the dirt, then we used a backhoe to dig the footer's, and we built the forms for the footer's with wood and used a laser level to make them level, we also used plastic moisture barrier inside the forms. Then hired a concrete company to pour the concrete in the footer's we put rebar and rock in the bottom of the footer's before the pour to strengthen it. Once concrete was poured we put rebar sticking up out of the concrete where our pillars were going to be. Once the concrete dried we took the form boards off. Then laid blocks for our pillars, made sure they were level and square. Once we had the foundation finished everything was square and level we started building the floor using j bolts to tie the floor down to the concrete pillars. Once we finished the floor we started framing walls connected the walls to the floor frame and to each other. Braced the walls up using 2x6 nailed to the floor. Once we got all the walls framed and squared up and plum we started sheathing the outside to make it stronger and tie it all together. Then we started build a ridge cradle for the beam of the roof and started hanging trusses. We have a cathedral ceiling so it's different than a traditional roof. We sheathed the roof, laid out barrier and installed metal. Finished the vapor barrier on the outside walls also. Installed doors and windows and she's now in the dry. It's a small 24x24 house with a 2 bedroom loft and master bed downstairs. All rooms are 12x12, living room and kitchen is all open so it's 24x12. Bathroom is 12x12 as well and will double as a laundry room. We didn't buy a blueprint we came up with a layout and drew it out then started staking lines to mark it off. We decided on a 24x24 to cut down on waist and cutting. The center is exactly 12 foot so we knew exactly where each footer needed to be and where to put the pillars. It's taken us a few years to get it in the dry. We used income tax and stimulus to build and pay our land off.",

            "comment": "We're in progress.  9/12 foundation holes completed.  The last 3 are started but [need hand finishing](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrY7BuathQL/).  It's a lot, doing it ourselves.  But we have friends who used to build houses or work in the trades.  Progress is slow but ever forward.  We're legally required to contract out the Electrical, Plumbing, and Propane but we can do the rest ourselves.  Those are the 3 things I wouldn't have wanted to do myself anyhow so no biggie for us.\n\nIt took us about 5 years to find a house that met our needs.  Affordable, self buildable (we're on a tight budget), able to pass inspection, durable.  Most of your average manufactured housing is total crap.  Our planning and zoning office warned us that bringing a shed conversion to code was just as expensive as a real house.  All the pre-fabs we liked were too expensive.  \"Cheap Tiny Homes\" were great article titles but they always started at like $150k for 150 sq ft.  How is that considered affordable?!  $1000 per square foot?!\n\nThen there were the companies that sounded promising but didn't pan out.  They'd find out they didn't meet US codes or the international shipping would be too much or there would be customs fees almost as much as the house costs.  Or the company would vanish, fail to get funded, the price would go up tenfold, twentyfold.  FIVE YEARS I searched.\n\nIt wasn't just the houses themselves.  It was making sure it'd be affordable, buildable, pass inspection in our jurisdiction, etc.  There were quite a few houses we fell in love with over the years that fell through for one reason or another.\n\nIn the end, we got an Arched Cabin.  They're cheap, easy to assemble, customizable, affordable delivery.  We especially liked that they're pretty quick to dry in once you've got the frame up.  In a place with extreme temp swings and no shade, getting the house up as quickly as we can will be a huge help in giving us somewhere to climate control while we proceed. \n\nBut, of course, I can't tell you the best and worst of doing this until we're done.  We're just going into this knowing we'll make some mistakes and it'll take as long as it takes because we've never done this before.\n\nI'll also recommend Building Off the Grid for casual viewing while you're doing something else.  They like to catch the mistakes for drama so you get to see a lot of the oopses and regrets and fumbles along the way.  But also companies, terms, inventions that help off grid and self built homes become reality.  If nothing else, I feel like it better prepared me for what to expect.  And now that I'm typing this, I find myself wondering if that's why I have such a better attitude about our slow progress compared to my hubby.  He always seems to think any project will take one day, 3 days, or 1 week.  And when they take longer than one of those pre-assessed times, he gets really frustrated.  Meanwhile, I'm always either over-estimating how long it'll take or just shrugging and recognizing that nobody seems to get done on the schedule they set.",

            "comment": "My house was put in by family members, not by me, but I agree with their decision making: At a given price point, you can usually get much more quality and durability from high-quality manufactured housing than from stick-built. \n\nGetting it legally permanently affixed takes a bit more doing, and finding lenders to loan on the purchase of manufactured is harder, but still ultimately a pretty good tradeoff. \n\nIf you're installing manufactured on a slab, look into encapsulating the crawlspace beneath at install time. The big drawback to manufactured is how it has a waterproof belly wrap under the floor joist insulation, which holds water from any leak above it and makes a horrible mess. Better to insulate around masonry skirting or foundation walls than to have outdoor conditions under the house, IMO. \n\nI'd rather have a manufactured that was built in a dry factory than a stick-built that was framed over a wet winter, but that's probably because i'm old-fashioned in some ways.",

You can buy the shell and build the inside yourself. Honestly, it's the best option for anyone wanting a home. You'll get it faster, you can order one that's already primed for power, water, etc. Just prepare the site and get your septic taken care of.\n\nPrefab will save you so many headaches and so much stress. Go with a nicely built one with quality materials.",

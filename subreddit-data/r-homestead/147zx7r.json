    "postText": "Question for folks in California (I think, though specific counties may be more applicable). Someday, I'd like to build my homestead on raw land--something zoned as rural farmland, or the like. \n\nI'm trying to figure out what the annual needs are for just holding the land. So for example, if I bought x acres of land outright, besides the tax and insurance payments, are there other upkeep costs I need to account for? For example, is there a requirement to keep any growth trimmed down to some extent to prevent fire hazard, etc?\n\nThis is probably a really basic question. But any guidance would be appreciated.",

The state can legally mandate you to control certain weeds at your own cost.\n\nWhen we first bought our property there were no noxious weeds and we had no weed control cost.  About 3 years in, yellow hawkweed was discovered and we had to start spraying annually since hawkweed cannot be controlled by mowing.\n\nDepending on your land size and the weeds, the cost could be nothing or it could be hundreds of dollars per year.",

Fans are better at creating negative pressure than positive pressure, so don\u2019t blow air into the barn, draw the air out (and Bernoulli is your friend, use him). Make your own evaporative cooling system by placing landscape fabric to screen over where the majority of air is drawn in, direct misters onto fabric.",

You can mount it low on a wall and use it in conjunction w/ a roof vent/fan.  \n\nA misting system will cool the air inside.  When it's hot, the water will evaporate before it hits the ground.",

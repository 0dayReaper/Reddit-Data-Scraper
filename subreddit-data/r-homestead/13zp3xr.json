It\u2019s important that they aren\u2019t too crowded so people either plait them into strings, put them on a rack like OP has done, or just spread them out so that the bulbs have good airflow.\n\nOnce the skin goes dry and papers and the stems are dried, they are ready for storing.",

I\u2019ll leave them on these racks with a fan running on them 24/7 for 4-6 weeks so the flavor develops. You want the moisture in them to evaporate (kinda the same concept as reducing a sauce to make the flavor more potent).",

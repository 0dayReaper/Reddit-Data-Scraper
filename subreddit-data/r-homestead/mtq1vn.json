He would always make us kids grab a rock from the stream and bring it to the house (up a small hill) when we went swimming and he made stuff like an outdoor pizza oven, a BBQ grill etc with those stones and mortar.\n\nIt wasn't until I was a grown adult that it hit me that he \"dug\" that swimming hole by bringing stones up for years and years.\n\nIf you do that just fyi get a pole with a hook on it near there incase of dead animals that get swept down stream end up in it :)\n\nOther than that it was awsome!",

Recommended removing invasive plants, grasses, etc and gave a detailed planting plan for hardwoods, native grasses, shrubs, berries, etc. They also provided access to state resources to get free or deeply discounted trees, seeds, and consulting. \n\nAll of this was at no cost. I may not get to fully appreciate the end result of all of these efforts but by kids and future grandkids will have an amazing property. Well worth looking into.",

You just have to tap into it. Spend a few nights on YouTube university. Find out how much power on average your home uses each day, and then you\u2019ll know how much power you need to generate. From there you can figure out how much it will cost to build and how long it will take to break even on the investment.\n\nI live on the western side of the Canadian Rocky Mountains and I get my water from a creek about 4 KM away, 600-900 feet or so above my house, on the mountain I live on. I have a 1\u201d pipe running all the way to my house that carries all my domestic water, but I\u2019m planning on tapping into my overflow water line with a generator, and then feeding a series of holding tanks sequenced with turbines, running down the hill on my property. I have a near 45\u00b0 slope at least over several acres (mountains, like I said) so I have good gravity to use. It\u2019s nowhere near as ideal as what you have but it\u2019s still very cool.\n\nIf you can\u2019t tell, I\u2019m excited about doing it when the funds permit.",

In other words, it\u2019s owned by our provincial government and more than likely will never ever be developed or sold. Similar to national forest or something else controlled by the BLM in the US. It was logged a little over 50 years ago but having a registered water licence there protects it, and there isn\u2019t much there worth cutting right now anyway even though I\u2019m in an old historical logging town.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty more ways than micro hydro to make your own electricity. Hydro just happens to be a very good bang for your buck in addition to being reliable and plentiful.\n\nThere are some great websites with listings of land for sale all over the US. You guys have an amazing plethora of places to choose from, and plenty of sellers who will offer very friendly private financing. You\u2019ll find no such thing out here in this part of Canada. Even in a massive massive province it\u2019s becoming very competitive for the little developed and available land that there *is.* It\u2019s expensive, and unless there\u2019s a completed home on the lot with all the utilities hooked up and everything, it\u2019s a 40% down payment for a land loan. Be glad you have so much choice and opportunity available!\n\nGet out there and get it!",

My husband and I grew up here so staying near family has always made sense but parts of NC can be really ideal for homesteaders.  We have a pretty mild climate and usually good water access (July and August can feel like Hell's front porch but still better than in the Deep South states). In rural areas many people still keep small gardens and animals so neighbors can be there for advice or to help out if needed. However, CAFO chicken and pig farms, tobacco, corn, and soybean monocultures can be nuisances at best and environment destroying at the worst so picking a suitable property can take time. Rural properties can be found at good prices if you aren't too picky that it is \"perfect\". Most large tracts that are flat and cleared will be substantially more expensive than a sloping/hilly property that is wooded but I assume this happens everywhere. One big negative is that well paying employment can be difficult to find in the more rural areas so commuting has become much more common than in the past. Before COVID my husband had a 2 hour commute each day but he is luckily working from home for the foreseeable future which gives him a lot more time each day to get farm work done. \n\nPlease message me if there is any more info I can give you!",

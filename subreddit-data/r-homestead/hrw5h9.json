Our first goals have included starting some arctic kiwis.  It's not very acidic or has very much clay, but is quite rocky!   The neighbour does a lot of farming and has been giving us the scoop on what nurtients he uses.  A lot of shell fish meal from the local fish plants.  Most of the water we have is from a well but there are quite a few rivers nearby and we get a ton of rainfall.  Rising sea levels bother me a bit, but we are about 50 feet above sea level which helps for now.",

Thought about how to best utilize the property in the future (issue being I don't live in province, and would like something low maintenance for the family that is there) so I was thinking some fruit trees, heard good things about sea buckthorn, as well as trying to cultvate wild mushroom zones (was going to drop a lot of logs, and let them run wild in a mossy area along a creek). Already has blueberries, raspberries, cherries and crabapples, river access (lots of birds when in season as well. I've never heard of arctic kiwis but they look like cucamelon - sea buckthorn was something I thought was good to plant and possibly economically viable.  \n\n\nMy goal next time I'm down was to set up a small, self seeding/.recurring natural plot, as well as start a few proper compost piles to slowly amend the soil. If you're dealing with a rocky area I would start with something like that, a system to increase organic matter and biodiversity while also increasing the plantable depth ('cause yeah, sometimes you dig a foot and it's rock or packed clay). Field is clover but I figure winter wheat/rye would be the ideal cover crop for the colder season. \n\nShellfish is great :) use up those lobsters, clams and oysters, ha. I was looking in to how to best grind down oyster shells as they'd be easy to get, but my lungs would regret that - the chitinase produced via shellfish/crustaceans is incredibly beneficial for your plants/insect/disease resistance. \n\nThe house is now restored but I remember my first time down walking in to a ruddy damp house everyone was so fond of, there was a hole in to the basement ( a grass pit really), and the sink leaked immediately - which was promptly wrapped in duct tape. good times, ha.",

In only 8 years I already 'feel' like a country farmer and can't imagine ever having to live in the city again.\n\nIn my own opinion a barn is a must to have if having livestock -AND YOU SHOULD.   Our goats, sheep, turkey's, chickens and pigs fill our days and lives with unconditional love we never knew we had capacity to accept.\n\nOur only regret? That we didn't walk away from our good paying stressful treadmill lives SOONER. (Neither of us even own cell phones now.)  I was 46 when we started.  and now this 54 yr old man finds all the physical work gets more and more difficult each year.\n\nEnjoy your Acadian NB life.

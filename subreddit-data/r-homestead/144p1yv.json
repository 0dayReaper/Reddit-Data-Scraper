    "postText": "It's been a while since I've posted garden rejuvenation. Anyway here's some updates.\nWe got our electric poultry net to expand the temporary Coop run from the previous owners before I can rebuild it proper. We planted some mustard greens, peas, Brussel sprouts, peppers, and tomatoes. The current fence is way to short and deer have been destroying the peas... anywho most of the garden was cover cropped with buckwheat, I chopped it and covered it for a bit before I transplant my summer plants. I started to install my 5 foot perimeter fence, and by start I've only got 2 T-posts in and one corner section done(mostly) we got a great Pyrenees puppy... who isn't house broken... so that's been rough. 23 of my 25 bresse chick's died while I was away... but all 25 egg layer chick's have melted and moved to the tractor for grow out. 10 of our 11 ducklings have made it to adulthood, no eggs or babies yet, we have 1 drake and 9 hens.\nOur four turkeys are adults now and we have 3 toms and 1 hen -_-.  Anywho here's some pictures.",

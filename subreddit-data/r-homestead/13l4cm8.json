    "postText": "I own 11 acres and next to me is a parcel that is 5 acres that I\u2019d like to purchase from the owner.  The owner is listed as a trust out of state and no one around has ever met them.  The land is raw, no buildings. \n\nThe land has one very small buildable spot, but you couldn\u2019t get to it any other way other than through my land, which they don\u2019t have any right of ways etc. \n\nI was looking to purchase it because I\u2019d like to build a workshop on that spot and the land has a year round stream.  I currently don\u2019t have any surface water, so that would be a huge gain.  \n\nSince it\u2019s an out of state trust, I didn\u2019t want to come right out and say I owned the adjoining parcel because they might take advantage of that fact, I was thinking about having a lawyer approach them and offer a fair price.  That would let me keep my name out of it until the closing.  \n\nAnyone ever dealt with something similar?",

After about 18 months of us bugging the guy, he caved and we got the adjacent lot at a fair price.  Patience was our game.  Learn as much as you can about the seller, find a weakness...we bought a property off a guy who was in tax trouble in a couple of neighboring communities...we offered a fast closing at a steep discount to the asking price...he jumped at our offer because we were willing to close in three days.\n\nAbout trusts, sometimes they are simply an estate planning or tax planning tool.  All of our land is held in a trust, my wife &amp; I are trustees, the decision making for our trusts are no different than for things that we own directly.  Trusts can also be more complicated.

Plenty of buildings encroach across property lines... and when the property is surveyed or sold, the encroaching building must removed at the expense of the person who built it/currently owns it.  If you do it with intentions of possessing the land via squatters rights, you may also face a lawsuit over the hassle you've created.",

All they have to do is make ANY move to identify that they don't accept the OP taking over their land and it's invalidated- even a cease-and-desist form letter from their attorney kills adverse possession.  The OP cannot sell the property with that building included, so their expense can't be recouped.  Some states have extremely long adverse possession laws for this specific purpose.",

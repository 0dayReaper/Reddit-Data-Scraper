My flock will be quite large by the fall. \n\nI hatched so many chickens too - way too many\u2026. On a plus note our freezer still has some room for now, and we will have more eggs than we know what to do with.  \n\nOur plan is to eat the roosters, sell excess hens in the fall, reduce the flock back to about 24-36 chickens and 9-12 turkeys.  Rinse wash and repeat each year. We sell the turkeys for income to balance the farm costs and eat them.",

I forget about them because they hatch their own eggs. I\u2019ve been incubating and handling the chickens and turkeys.  \n\nWe have 4 incubators here, 3 NR360 and 1 like the one you have those in.  Turkeys have the nurture rights and chickens have had the other one\u2026 too many chickens here\u2026 triple digits right now from 22 hens from last user.",

We've been grabbing the eggs they've been roosting and then abandoning and putting them in the incubator(not this one, one with a turner and fan). We've been kinda unsure what to expect. We've been looking at the eggs with a flash light and guessed these would hatch soon, so we moved them to this one, and we were right! We have probably 20 more abandoned eggs in there and are hoping for good luck.",

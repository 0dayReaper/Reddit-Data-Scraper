But an animal just brushing against the plant is usually enough to release some of the oil.  Because it's an oil, it's not water soluble so just being rained on doesn't wash it away.  If you kill the plant and wait for it to dry out, chances are there will be less of the oil around, but it's still going to have some of the oil, so you still have to handle it carefully.  The oil can stick around for a long time.  If you have a certain blade you use to cut it, and put that blade in the shed, then go and grab it a couple years later, you can still get the rash.\n\nIf it's just the ground growing stuff, I'll kill it and let it sit and dry out, then rake it up into a pile somewhere to decay slowly in peace.  If it's a vine on a tree, a try to catch it before it gets big, but if it gets big, I just cut it at the base and leave the vine on the tree, there is no good way to get it off safely.",

I walk my property for new plants showing up and spray with [BioAdvance Brush Killer Plus](https://bioadvanced.com/brush-killer-plus-concentrate.html).  It wouldn\u2019t work on huge vines that have climbed trees, but I\u2019d cut like you said and spray the crap out of the root side of the plant and that should do it.

Apparently it can\u2019t get through latex gloves, but it can get through rubber in some cases. Roots and stems carry 10-100x the amount of urushiol. I have never tried to remove it but I do work around it every summer. Just be diligent that anything you wear/touch gets well washed. Clothes maybe 2 cycles w hot water.",

Poison ivy leaves oils which is why you want to use dish soap.",

Aside from the low maple leaves they could reach the poison Ivy was the first thing they ate. They acted like it was candy. Just to give you an idea, this area has trees on the edge, honey suckle, wild rose and a wide variety of other weeds in the center. After the first day all the poison Ivy was gone.",

If it's up in a tree or other living things Dad taught me to trim 5 inches out of the vine, pull the vine away a good foot from the tree up and down both, plant both exposed cuts with straight 2 4 D with a small craft paint brush for about 5 minutes.  Works like a charm.  Straight dawn dish soap helps also to remove the oil from your skin. I treat our place every year.",

I used a spray solution and went over it thoroughly spraying every single plant i could find. This took me a couple weeks of going out every evening for an hour or so. Next season, the roots put out some new leaves and i killed those leaves as well. After 2 seasons, all the poison ivy was permanently gone.\nIt's important to be thorough and kill all of it because it grows quickly.",

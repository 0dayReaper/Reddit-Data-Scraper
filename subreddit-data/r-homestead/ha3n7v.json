I can\u2019t imagine them living in a warehouse with 10k birds.\n\nWe've had chickens for 4-5 years and are doing our first meat birds this year, before I'd just processed a mean rooster or two and a couple that had gotten injured beyond likely recovery in mishaps. \n\nI don't know how I feel about Cornish Cross chickens.  It's nothing more than selective breeding but they're almost unnatural. \n\n On one hand, the breeding makes them very gentle and sweet natured (a side effect of tolerating mass environments).  But at the same time, they're so lazy, and eat so much, and grow so fast, they die of heart attacks by the time they're six months old. They normally reach market weight in an industrial setting in 6-8 weeks.\n\nI feel worse for how they're treated at the end of their lives then I do for how they're raised.  Typically they're pretty roughly scooped up and tossed into big crates, thrown on a semi and driven in open air/heat etc. 60-120 minutes to the factory.   \n\nI still eat meat, but I practically could be  almost vegetarian from May-August here.  I have more fresh produce from our garden then I know what to do with, lots of eggs, and we get milk from a local farm and make cheese as well.",

Ours free range and live in the same coop as all our other birds.  They have regular chicken lives but only get to live 8ish weeks.",

That in and of itself would reduce meat consumption.\n\nnot really, maybe in some places. But a lot of the country has a lot of local farmers that sell their meat to local grocers, and they tend to be cheaper (at least the chicken is) and if you to the northeast there's lobster everywhere. I think thered be a lot more local farmers filling in for the non beef meat market in such a situation",

And good luck getting anything butchered if you didn\u2019t already have an appointment. The big plants that had to close due to Covid 19 are sending hogs they didn\u2019t terminate to the small local plants. We were trying to find a place for a friend to get a 4-h hog butchered this summer after their fair, and the earliest appt was Christmas Eve. By the time we\u2019d called them back that day, the date was gone, and the next available was end of January. We probably called ten different small plants, and I\u2019d bet they\u2019re all booked into April by now. \n\nPeople are absolutely willing to buy and sell that way, but the process is way backed up right now and is going to have market consequences for some time. There\u2019s a demand and a supply, but they can only process the livestock so fast. At the very least, there\u2019s probably going to be a dip in product from big CAFO brands (because of plant closures and mass terminations), which is probably going to freak people out again, causing more people to buy up what is there. I imagine it will be several cycles like that, especially if the Second Wave hits harder than the first did. At least stores have been setting more limits on what people can buy at a time, so that\u2019s something.",

Large-scale has more to do with corporate farming, but CSAs can still be widespread. They'll just be individual and local, which is kind of the point.\n\nThey could use more support, but there are organizations that can give them that support, and still keep the CSA in question individually owned and locally based. Here the [Arkansas Valley Growers](http://www.arkvalleygrowers.com/arkansas-valley-organic-growers.html) association combines the resources of a bunch of local farms, and helps them with marketing, distribution and I think some banking and loan options (I may be thinking of another co-op for that though).\n\nI think people value local and healthy food, we've just grown up going to supermarkets and cooking pre-packaged foods. It will be a learning curve, but a lot of people are willing to start. They just need to figure out how.",

If you wanted to eat, you farmed it or killed it.\n\nCertainly true in rural areas, but far less true in cities.  \n\nI live in rural arkansas, and my wife is from the town we live in.  Her grandfather is 90 and even in the 1930's and 1940's when her grandfather was growing up in the Ozark mountains, they raised chickens and hogs and gardened and canned and hunted and fished. (and they were prosperous).    You went to the store and mostly bought sugar and coffee and flour and staples like that.   The funny thing is her grandfather prizes modern convenience. he thinks we're a little crazy for wanting to process our own chickens, although he is quite skeptical of pesticides and chemicals and things. \n\nWhat WAS true in the 1800's (150 years ago was only 1870 at this point - starting to get into industrial foodpacking) is that if you lived in a city and you wanted meat,  you would go down to the butcher.  The butcher would have a shop where live animals went in the back and they sold meat in the front.  Those animals had probably been shipped in, but came in \"on the hoof.\"  Because it can't go bad until it's killed. They'd do everything from the killing to the curing and smoking.  They'd have fresh whole chickens and sides pig and etc. hanging in the shop for sale.  \n\n[this is a butcher shop in london Circa 1900](http://www.theworkhome.com/media/images/galleries/butchers-shop-watney-st-800-web.jpg)    [This is another one from apparently about the 1880's.](https://clarecarson1art.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/london-shop.jpg) \n\n\nI see geese, ducks, chickens, whole hams, what look like rib primals, what is probably a whole lamb.",

As soon as cities became a thing, 8000 years ago or so, growing both grain crops and animals tended to move toward the edges since they needed a lot more space, and the crops and animals were brought in to sell.\n\nThere was still a lot more integration than we see today, though. Chickens and small game animals can be raised in populous areas, and kitchen gardens probably always existed to grow herbs and greens and whatever else didn't travel or store well. The bigger the city, the bigger the surrounding area needed to support it.\n\nAnd eventually erosion happened in those surrounding areas and the city either shrunk, moved or started conquering its neighbors for *their* farmland.",

This year we will be attempting to do two of them on our own. The plan is to shoot them in the head, (there are diagrams for this online and I'm butchering books) so they are given the quickest and least painful death possible. By doing this we are eliminating the stress of moving them and dropping them off in a foreign place. \n\nI do love all of my animals so there's always a little sadness in saying goodbye, but it's something that I go into ready for before I even bring the animal home. It feels incredible to be able to feed my family with good quality meat. I know if my animals were ever given antibiotics or other medications and I don't have to just hope that a supermarket label isn't fooling me. \n\nWhen all of the world started panicking about food a few months ago, I can't explain how good it felt to know that I had freezers full of meat and animals outside that could be used if this lasted a long time. The security and comfort in knowing that I can keep my family fed in times of crisis is worth any and everything.",

The other birds (ideally) stay in the coop so they don't see the process. It does affect them when they can see it. They are quieter, more subdued, flightier, and don't lay as much for about a week.\n\nI hang the birds upside down from a line and use a *very sharp* knife to cut their throats. I seriously doubt they feel anything at all. If you've had a fast, sharp cut, you don't feel anything for a few minutes. Within one minute, they've bled out and are already gone.\n\nI'll let them drain for about 10 minutes or so, then process them in my shop. Once the animal has been skinned, it doesn't bother me as much. Though seeing a bird I cuddled and raised from a chick hanging dead hurts my heart a little.\n\nBut again, I know this bird had a good life and wanted for nothing. There are a variety reasons we'd cull  a bird. They may be too aggressive with the other birds. They might be egg-eaters. They might old, sick, or hurt. Though we are currently fostering a 10 yr old bird who hasn't laid in years. We'll care for her until the end of her natural life. I will only cull her if it's obvious she's suffering. \n\nSide note: I wouldn't say our birds taste \"better\" than store-bought chicken, but they do taste more like chicken. Just more flavor.",

I bought a pound of bacon from a farmer who showed me a picture of the pig it came from and told me stories about it. \n\nThe next morning, I was cooking half of it when I heard a noise at the screen door: a friendly dog was waiting there, patiently, for a slice of bacon. I complied, gave bacon and scritches, and doggie trotted off.\n\nThe next day, I'm cooking the second half of the bacon when I hear a noise at the door. \"Doggie must be back!\" I think, and cool off a slice to share. But when I get to the screen door, there is an entirely different dog! \n\nIt may just be that news (or the scent of good bacon) travels fast, but that magical, dog-attracting bacon totally made my week.

I don't believe that cutting out meats completely is healthier for you than eating them in moderation. \n\nI also wholeheartedly disagree with the idea that farming crops is any better for the environment than raising livestock. Crops deplete soils of their nutrients leaving soils that are unable to grow anymore crops without the addition of fertilizer and minerals. Tilling the land repeatedly for planting contributed greatly to the Dust Bowl. Crops have to be grown, for the most part, in wide open fields. This means we need to clear enough land to be able to grow enough crops to replace the meat we're no longer eating. Livestock can be raised on rugged terrain and wooded areas. The negative environmental impact from livestock comes from factory farms keeping lagoons of blood and feces that contaminate water sources nearby. In order to grow enough crops to keep my family fed without meat I would need machinery. The use of the machinery would have more of a negative environmental impact than my livestock that doesn't require machinery would. \n\nI hope I answered all of your questions, I tend to ramble on about these subjects.",

Here are some studies to read on both: \n\n[Nutrition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3662288/): shows the positive impacts of a diet that discourages meat and dairy consumption\n\n[\"Blue Zone\" nutrition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125071/): a study on the diets (and, unrelated, lifestyle) of the populations with the highest life expectancies and best health.ay include some animal products, but severely limited. \n\n[Environmental impact 1](https://files.wri.org/s3fs-public/Shifting_Diets_for_a_Sustainable_Food_Future_1.pdf) \n\n[Environmental impact 2](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2018.00008/full) \n\nAnd to directly address your point of the Dust Bowl, it was caused by poor soil maintenance and droughts. It isn't specifically vegetables that do this - it's monoculture farming. In the case of the Dust Bowl, it was wheat and corn. Which, though this may not have been true back then, nearly half of the grains produced today are fed directly to livestock. \n\nSo, even if we ignore the fact that vegetable farming is easily made sustainable if you practice things like no-till and vary your crops to prevent soil depletion, if you want to grow fewer plants to protect the soil, you shouldn't eat meat. \n\nAnd, I thought you said that you sent these animals away to be killed? Doesn't that mean that you're contributing to the factory pollution, as well?\n\nSo, though I am from a moral aspect against eating meat anyway, science consistently backs the plant-based diet for sustainability and health. If it comes down to not being able to give up taste, that's fine - nothing to argue on that. But that's really the only reason that isn't refutable.",

The pigs convert leftover scraps into a valuable source of protein in a way that legumes just can't. They taste better than any pork you'll find at a big box grocery, and there is nothing you can do to respect an Animal's life more than to use every part of it. The bones for meal, the meat for food, the offal for sausage and feed (for chickens or the dogs), the skin as leather, trotters and spare bones for stock. They ate and used it all. \n\nIt makes the Pig's life have purpose beyond being a pet.",

            "comment": "Reminds me of a section of an article I once read on humane farming: \n\n&gt;**It's ultimate betrayal**. Imagine for a moment how we would judge someone who devised a plan to win the trust of a child only to betray that child by violently taking his life. And imagine that the perpetrator\u2019s intent was to make a profit off of that victim\u2019s body. Would we look for reasons to come to the perpetrator\u2019s defense, saying perhaps that at least the child lived a good life? Or, would we say that at least the child didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to him? Of course not. A perpetrator who premeditates a murder so as to benefit from that person\u2019s death is considered far more culpable in the eyes of the law, and thus his punishment is more severe. The same is true when animals are visibly victimized. When we hear about, for instance, someone who tortured and killed a cat for kicks and then posted a video on YouTube, or a boyfriend who retaliated against his ex-girlfriend by killing her dog, or the busting up of a cockfighting ring, we are outraged and demand justice in such cases. This reaction is based on our belief that harming others without just cause is categorically wrong. And harming animals, particularly in the name of pleasure, offends our sensibilities. Now consider the case of the \u201chumane\u201d farmer who claims to foster a caring and trusting relationship with his animals, treating them with kindness and respect, sometimes even naming them. His animals may respond in kind, bonding with and perhaps even becoming affectionate with their caretaker. But all along, the farmer has ulterior motives to kill them so he can butcher and sell their dismembered parts as soon as they develop to a certain size and weight. All along, his intention is to artificially breed them into this world only to slaughter them in their infancy or adolescence to profit from products procured from their flesh or bodily secretions that are unnecessary for human health. In no way does this constitute a humane intention, let alone a humane act. The more humanely an animal is treated, the greater is the bond of trust, and the greater the bond of trust, the more severe the crime of betrayal. It is a betrayal not just to the animal, but also to our most deeply held values of justice, reciprocity and respect for others.",

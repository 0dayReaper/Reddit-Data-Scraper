There are blackberry bushes everywhere, especially in the orchard/vineyard where these photos are from. It is taking *forever* to cut them back with branch shears, any suggestions on how to do it faster?",

When you've cut them all, you can then remove and throw the top parts into a firepit. Then go back right after the rain and pull all these leftover stalks out, so you can remove the roots while the earth is soft. Do it when it's dry and the root will just release right at the base of the stalk. Grab it firmly with both gloved hands, and pull straight up for best results. Get above it.",

I was fumbling with the pieces trying to figure out what order they went in and he abruptly said \u201cNo\u201d and started grabbing the pieces in the order they needed to go and handing them to me!!!!\n\n\nHis grandparents were pretty impressed when I ask to make sure it was right before we started bringing cows in, as no one had ever shown him he had just watched his grandpa do it almosst every day of his life.",

She drank 2 five gallon buckets, then popped up to her feet and nursed the little one.  And head butted us out of the way in no uncertain terms.   Tired, but healthy.",

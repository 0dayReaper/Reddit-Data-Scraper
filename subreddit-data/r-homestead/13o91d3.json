I think you could probably find a sealer and then repaint for a permanent solution.  Shermin Williams might have something for this.  A tile membrane like redguard would work but needs to be covered by a veneer with mortar.",

Looks like the moisture from the ground is being drawn up the join lines and reacting with the bricks?\nIf it is mould, the cause is improper moisture barrier between the ground and concrete. Perhaps dig out around the slab edge and add better drainage material?",

    "postText": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI planted 35 paisano Determinate paste tomatoes for canning. \n\nI started them inside in April (zone 5b) and just transplanted them a 10 days ago. \n\nThey're tiny, which is fine. But. Some are already fruiting. Should I pinch off the flowers/buds? Or are they just fruiting insanely early?\n\nI've never grown determinate types before. Would love some advice! Thank you!",

            "comment": "First year determinate grower here in 8a - I have no wisdom from experience, however did have a similar concern with mine. A few of the blossoms came far earlier than the indeterminates, and I worried they would be the only fruits that would set (to pinch or not to pinch. That was my question). I left them alone, and that seems to have been an 'ok' answer. More blooms and fruit (and actual plant growth) are coming in over the weeks since the first blossoms appeared.\n\nI am starting to suspect I like growing determinate over indeterminate, but ask again in a month or two...\n\nGood luck on the crop, regardless!",

Last year I couldnt keep up with the indeterminates. I work 60 hours a week, and try to grow as much as I can to self sustain as much as I can. They got overwhelming.",

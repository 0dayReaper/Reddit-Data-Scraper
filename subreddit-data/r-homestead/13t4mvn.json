Some steep hills. \n\n\nI live in the middle of a large property with lots of trails through the fields and wooded areas. The guy who used to mow the trails can\u2019t do it anymore. \n\nI\u2019m looking for suggestions for a trail mower that\u2019s easy to start, operate and hook up to the back of my Kawasaki Mule - a machine a 60-something woman can manage. I figure someone in this group can steer me in right direction. Thanks in advance!",

    "postText": "Hi folks We have 100 layers here, hoping to go up to 300 next season. Feeding a mix of straights (oats, wheat and peas) plus supplementals (oyster shell &amp; seaweed meal on free [feed](https://permies.com/t/997/chickens/best-perennial-chicken-feed)). We keep them using pastured system - an egg mobile moved everyday. Hoping to start sprouting at least 50% of their daily ration.   \nWe are feeding 10kg (22lbs) of feed ration at the moment daily, and will be moving up to 30kg (66lbs) daily by the time we have 300 hens. anyone else sprouting at this level (or near it) show me your set ups!   \n\n\nAlso wondering what the optimal sprouting time is, or how to judge it?   \n\n\nThanks!",

Malting/sprouting your grain seems like it would be a ton of work and likely wouldnt save you much.\n\nI mean you would be feeding 10 tons of feed per year. Maybe it would be more economical to get a small bulk bin or grain hopper, and order/pickup bilk feed by the ton?",

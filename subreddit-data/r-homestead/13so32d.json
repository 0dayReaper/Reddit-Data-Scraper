            "comment": "Currently, I have five hotwires with no ground wires between them. I have three ground rods connected to the ground port of the charger. This is not effective due to how rocky my soil is. Some areas are testing at 12,000 V, others are testing at 3000. Fox is climbing right through the wires with no fear. This fence was built to keep out bears so it\u2019s clearly not going to work. If I switch to do some thing like in the picture above, would that work? I would add ground wires between the hot wires and more rods around the perimeter to assist with grounding? I have zero experience with electric fences, so I wanted to run it past someone who knows what they are doing before adding more rods/wires. My soil is extremely rocky, so I think the ground rods are the problem. I cannot get them straight in, so they are all at a very shallow angle. Basically buried sideways a foot under the ground.",

                    "comment": "The problem with shallow grounding rods is that the soil dries out quicker.  Even with ground rods at 4 feet deep, local farmers have had problems during drought conditions.  Their solution was to water around the ground rods but their problem was a lot less long term than what you are describing.  \n\nI don't know enough to answer your question, but I wonder if you could just switch some of the hot wires to ground wires to avoid having to string more wires.  That would take the ground moisture out of the equation since the charge is going through the animal, then back to the charger along the return wire.  \n\nI also don't see the advantage of all the ground rods, it the charge is running back to the charger above ground.",

                                    "comment": "Soil conductivity increases with moisture. According to me.  A random stranger on the internet.  But think about it.  Would you rather grab an electric wire standing on dry ground or standing in two inches of water?  When I started having problems during a drought about 9 years ago, I dumped a nearby water barrel around the ground rod.  I didn't do the testing afterward to prove it worked, but it seemed to.  I did that because I was talking with other farmers who said lack of ground moisture was the problem and watering around the ground rod was the solution. Now that I think about it, I was only working on one part of the problem (the area around the grounding rod) while the drought was affecting the entire pasture.  But you certainly need good conductivity around the ground rod.",

            "comment": "The manufacturers recommend adding more grounding rods for dry and rocky ground. But the ones you have definitely need to go straight down (not sideways) the whole 2 metres of their length, so that's probably the place to start. Maybe use an auger and crowbar to try and get them in?",

He brought a tool meant for driving ground rods and even that equipment couldn\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t remember what the tool was called but it looked like giant impact drill that attaches to the ground rod. That\u2019s why I\u2019m considering trying a ground wire.",

    "postText": "So my neighbor today came over with a little sad surprise. He explained while burning vines he accidentally killed the mother of these poor babies. I\u2019m not sure how he did that but he asked me to try to save the babies that he found today since I have many different kinds of farm animals and basic knowledge of animal care. (Vets in my city will only take care of cats and dogs) \nSo the first thing I did was restrained the cat (she\u2019s relaxed about it and not stressed) and tried to put the babies on her nipples just to get them immediate milk because I don\u2019t know how longs it\u2019s been since they last ate.\n\nThey seem to be about a week old and I\u2019m thinking to feed them goat milk with a syringe.\n\nDoes anybody with experience have any recommendations on how to help these little guys make it?",

They\u2019re very cute and funny and bond well with people who spend time with them. We feed them cat food, insects, and other proteins. They are about 400g full grown, 200g at 6-8 weeks. They run on a wheel and need to be kept warm in their cage to prevent hibernation.\n\nThe African ones cost anywhere from $75 on Craigslist to $700 for a rare color from a breeder. Most are $200-400 though. Mine are $300 and I\u2019m near Chicago. The Egyptian ones started at $2000 a few years ago but have leveled off at $500.\n\n[This is a photo of an African and an Egyptian next to each other.](https://imgur.com/gallery/N3TliuP)\n\nWocket is the African, Petey is the Egyptian. I produced both of them and they belong to my friend Lelah. :)",

There is a woman in the Netherlands who has one who does, but she feeds a very different diet which may be the key there. From what I know, in the wild they only hibernate / torpor for a day or so until weather conditions change. They don\u2019t go for months like the European ones. In captivity if they hibernate for a day they usually survive, but longer than a few days and they don\u2019t. One of my customer\u2019s hedgies was hibernating for 3 days and survived another month, at which point it died from a bacterial overgrowth due to the hibernation a month prior. They should have seen a change him her poop but they didn\u2019t, so it\u2019s on them for sure.",

Hibernation takes HOURS to come on if they\u2019re below 68F, and getting them out is fairly simple, you just warm them on your body with a blanket over you and them. For their cage they get a heat lamp like a lizard or turtle.\n\nThey can survive falls from many heights, can eat a lot of poisons and survive, are one of the only natural predators of cockroaches, and were living in garbage heaps when they were collected and brought over to be pets in the 90\u2019s.

When very young they have no quills and stand a high likelihood of being eaten by there parents.  Based on the size I would introduce canned cat food. I would avoid wild insects because of parasites.  Note they are solitary and crabby creatures don't expect any affection",

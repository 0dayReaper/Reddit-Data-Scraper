    "postText": "Hello all,\nI recently purchased a vintage American grass blade and want to bend a hackberry sapling into a snath, and Google has not been as helpful as I'd like.\n\nCould anyone with a curved American scythe post X Y Z photos so I can get an idea of how the bends should be made?\nI mostly need to know if all the bends are in a single plane or if it's a complex bend.\n\nFrom watching videos, it looks like the two bends making the large curve are in one plane and smaller bend(s) near the blade are in another plane around 45\u00b0 from the big one.\n\nThanks.",

A quote from page 8 of that book suggests that there might not be particularly standard traditional dimensions (any typos are my own): \n\n\"The poles are steamed, bent to the desired shape, and dried. The problem with this method is that the amount of wood necessary to keep a permanent bend increases the weight of the snath. Old-timers tell of going to the farm supply store to buy a snath and taking half a day to try out each one of the snaths in stock, all of them slightly different. To reduce this variability in shape, snaths are now made even heavier, so each one turned out holds an identical pattern\"...\n\nI assume you're looking at the same bends as an aluminum snath, and for those, https://www.baryonyxknife.com/seminoalsn.html shows a pic where it looks like the handle bend is flat on the ground while the blade end of it lifts up some.",

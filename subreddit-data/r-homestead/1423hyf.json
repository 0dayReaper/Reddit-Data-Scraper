    "postText": "Just wondering how many have decided to homestead in retirement?  I retired at 63 and sold home in Oklahoma City area and moved to homestead in NW Oklahoma.  My brothers, sister and I actually went together and bought 160 acres in the late 1980's.  My brothers use it for deer hunting, my wife and I moved onto the land when I retired.  I am now 70 yrs old,  we have a manufactured home, well, septic, electricity....even satellite TV( totally did not expect to have this even available).  We have a large garden, including watermelons for farmer's market, chickens, cats and 6 head of mature cattle and 3 calves.  It has been a lot of work, but I think that being outside and working has actually improved my health.  I lost about 35lbs after moving here.  I never have time to get bored!",

In a few months we will be relocating to Florida!  Thank god!   I want to dial it back some.   I prefer to be on the ocean.   Fishing and diving and snorkeling.    We will always have chickens and a garden and a few goats but I'm burned out to be truthful.  I enjoy metal fabrication and wood turning more than pulling weeds and running fence.  Once life becomes less hectic maybe I'll have time for both.",

We keep expanding everything, but also make sure that we aren't adding huge amounts of required labor to our lives.\n\nFuture goals include traveling for 2 months at a time every 3-5 years, so having an labor efficient system is critical.  That way we can travel without worrying and enjoy our homestead when we're home.\n\nIn a perfect world, I'll still be puttering around the farm at 90...",

    "postText": "So recently I was a part of a conversation about how to put down chickens for butchering. One friend wants to find a way to put them down without them being stressed out or in pain, and another suggested injecting it with a bunch of insulin. She doesn't want to get attached to the chickens so she plans on spending very little time with them. There's got to be a better way to do it than overdosing it on insulin, so advice would be appreciated. Also, is that even safe or would it taint the meat?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit to add:  I don't think she should use insulin, I did not support the idea. She wants to spend NO time with the chickens (as to not get attached) and be able to put them down without them knowing she's doing it. The person who suggested insulin was her nurse friend, whose opinion she will probably take over mine. I just need help convincing her to try a different way, as surely there's a better way. Also, I can't imagine eating a chicken pumped full of insulin is safe for her, her husband, or her kids.",

Is this some kind of veterinary insulin?\n\nThere are people who slaughter and butcher for a fee, I myself have done it for trade (45 birds, I got 8, and a chicken plucker was rented or the job). I am sure there\u2019s someone in your area; ask around at the farmers market or food co-op. If you don\u2019t have those, ask at the local outdoor sporting goods store, or even local butchers,if there is one. A place that processes game is what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nThe insulin thing is a really bad idea. If she insists on doing it without blood, carbon dioxide would be a much much better choice; fast, utterly painless and no needles or scarce medical resources involved",

Our society has allowed us to grow up to middle age without having to have had to kill, or even often view death at all. If she's going to butcher and eat chickens, she's gonna have to face the music of butchery at some point. Only one way thru that, and thats lived experience. Pets and love, then kill cone, is the way. If she needs to pretend she's not killing them, gassing them is the only way, but carbon dioxide is a pricey way to go these days. The price shot up quite a bit during covid. And gassing an animal is still not without stress. They still have the moment where they face their death and struggle, even before going to sleep. It isn't just slipping peacefully into the great beyond.",

She could also contact local slaughterhouses and ask if they have any chicken farmers who sell meat.  Then figure out a way to buy or barter for meat, instead of trying to raise chickens and slaughter them without ever actually interacting with them.  There is absolutely no reason to try to butcher your own meat if you are not capable of dealing with the emotional attachment.  Much more practical and safer, much less trauma (for people and chickens).  Much less moronic advice from questionable health care providing friends.",

I'm not sure she can legally, but the medical workers in my area are pretty questionable. A doctor told my  sister-in-law that her socks were the reason she had scabies in her armpits. One nurse came to a restaurant I worked at with her friend with a ziploc full of pills she got from work and just started giving some out to her. Another one was trying to get her nursing/pregnant (don't remember which, was years ago) to take meds that had been expired for a year or more. When giving birth I had a nurse that when going to see how far I was dilated she kept trying to shove her fingers into the pee hole instead of the other one.  If nothing else, one of her 2 (possibly more) nursing friends can probably get a hold of some for her.",

Air in fridges is very dry.\n\nGenerally speaking, moist things that you want to stay moist go in the drawers. It also kinda stabilizes the temperature better since the air doesn't rush out when you open the door, but it's mostly about the humidity.\n\nI don't have experience with adjustable ones, but here's additional info -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisper_drawer\n\n\nBonus specifics (TIL) -- https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/how-to-use-your-crisper-drawer/\n\nedit:\nHere's a specific list of how you should separate them! --  https://www.subzero-wolf.com/assistance/answers/sub-zero/common/ethylene-producing-foods",

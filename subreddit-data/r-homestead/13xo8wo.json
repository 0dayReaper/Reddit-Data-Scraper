Find the faulty part with the troubleshooting vid and search its part number. If you have a leak in your condenser there are ways to repair it ..unlike a broken part it's a little more complicated than an afternoon with a electrical multimeter but if you can weld or use a weld-sub kit you can still probably fix it. I had never fixed an appliance in my life and got hired on as maintenance two years ago. Within 5 months of random breaks I had figured out how to fix almost anything broken in a fridge. I used YouTube solely to teach myself. The parts are like 5-25 dollars if it's not a propane fridge",

But with the drill I could do it with 30lb of seed. \nAnd with it shorted I can now do food plots for deer with it. If you get a non hydraulic one and shorten it , you can use a four wheeler in place of a tractor !",

I say this cause once you see it. Then you can see how to split it. All ya need to do is drop one side. And drill a few holes to relocate the wheel assembly . Bolt it on. And done. There are YouTube vids on it . Look up seed drill food plots or seed drill mods",

    "postText": "Well unfortunately  having to move to town for a bit. Be closer for work.the long drives are killing me.  I got the confirmation on a apartment yesterday. Its not in a big town and technically  its perfect, area wise right near the 2 major highways ill need but itll be the first time since i 14 i believe living in a town. Especially  a apartment still giving me chills. I was trying to find a small cheap house but none are any closer. Im hoping that soon i can find that house and be back to where i belong. \nTrying to be excited but having neighbors so close and lots of people around fills me with a bit of anxiety. Worse part is i have no place to setup my little woodworking shop which is usually how i relax and forget the world or taking walks through the woods. Definitely  gonna take some readjusting",

            "comment": "Sorry to hear, but such is life. Out of curiosity, did you have to sell your homestead, or do you still have it? Or were you renting it?\n\nI've been in both, and yes, I prefer the privacy and quietness of the country, but there are positives to living in an urban area.\n\n\\+Shorter commute (obviously), less maintenance (especially if renting), more social events/nightlife, better internet, public transportation, more job/career opportunities.\n\nLastly, I am pretty introverted/antisocial, so it came as a shock to me that during my living stint in the downtown area, I still met a few people that became good, genuine friends. That entire fact made the experience worth it.\n\nAlso, apartments nowadays are built to make it seem like you aren't surrounded by people. They are usually calm and quiet on the inside.\n\nChoose to focus on the good things, and good luck!",

Whaf makes the homestead as it were so nice. From what i heard thankfully seems petty quiet area lot of older folks or solid families so dont think itll be too loud.\n\nIronically this place while being fully renovated and in good shape the apartment itself is pobaly almost 100 years old if not older  its partof the original building which he landlord said he got a picture of it back in the day as a gas station with model Ts out front and its been almost everything under the sun till it was converted to these apartments i think he said in the 80s.\n\nThank you im gonna try to make the best of it all for now and try to stay positive",

You're making the right call, in my opinion.\n\nBelieve me when I say that even an apartment gives you solitude. Any space can become your personal space.\n\nLook at it as an experiment. If things go well, great! If not, you learned something about yourself. Find a way to get back to your homestead.",

And te sad part the project im on now is one of our closer ones  weve had recently. \n\nYeah the nice thing is the old building and new that was added later had a like patio/ covered walkway between what would be mine and our closest neighbors  so as far as i know no shared walls directly like that. The other apartment thats like 3 rooms  small is vacant thatd be connecting. \n\nDefinitely  gonna try itsgonna be wierd not seeing the trees when i walk outside, jump on a quad and run around a bit,  be out late if i feel workingon projects cause dont think i annoy the animals with the saws haha",

Take dry ice and wrap it in newspaper and lay it on the bottom of the cooler. Then layer wet ice over the top of that. The dry ice will keep the wet ice from freezing and the wet ice will keep your items chilled. The wet ice also helps to fill in voids between your newspaper layer and product which will help with even distribution of the chilling effect. You should be able to get dry ice at a local grocery or pharma supplier. You can just google your area and find a distributer.",

All of the other eggs I bought in Hillsboro just came out of an ice chest, nothing fancy. 2 years ago each egg vendor was regularly selling out, too. So I imagine it would be the same this year.

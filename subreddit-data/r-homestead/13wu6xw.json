    "postText": "Do any of you guys have experience or resources to share on building retaining walls or even maybe a small shed out of rock? I have a lot on my property but they\u2019re just random rocks (pretty good sized) so I\u2019m not sure if there are techniques that can be done without having to chisel them each into rectangles. Open to using either mortar or dry stacking for a retaining wall but I\u2019m in the desert so it needs to withstand flash floods. Any way of gauging how much rock I\u2019d need for a 10x12 cabin/shed? I have a lot but I feel like I may not have THAT much. But I imagine neighbors would be happy to donate more rocks to the cause if needed. Sorry for the million questions but everything I\u2019m finding on YouTube feels too professional with nice quarry rocks and whatnot. I\u2019m going for a \u201cpioneer making due with what they had\u201d sort of a vibe haha.",

Did it look great? Absolutely! Did it take forever and was it backbreaking work? Absolutely! Would I do it again? Maybe.",

Put in a layer of 2b stone. Pack tightly. Put in a 4\" perf black pipe run it to daylight. Cover tube with 2b. When your about a foot from the top put in tar paper and rebar on chairs. Fill with cement . Build stone walls on top. It's grinding work, lot of Tetris skill needed. But you have a building that lasts. Any questions please ask. I use type s for my mortar.",

I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of the typical challenges like freezing or constant moisture here in the desert and so stone structures are more forgiving to rookie mistakes. Was reading a historical book for my area and a lot of our pioneer built with stone to clear the land of them and because there\u2019s no wood out here to have any alternative. I imagine most of the pioneered had never built with stone before moving out here.",

            "comment": "I've worked with a mason on and off for a few years and I've learned some things. Most stone is not suitable for building. Throughout history building stone has been moved and recycled more than being used on site. Massive structures are usually built near a source of building stone. You can build with \" rubble\" and don't need rectangular blocks (ashlar), but they still need to be decent stones to begin with. Knock off awkward bits and shape your faces and corners with a block hammer. For mortar, use 7:2:1 sand:lime:portland. When you lay rock, use stone chips as shims to keep everything solid-- think of the mortar as a finish and not a glue.\n\nDon't lay a row longer than an armspan without tying in layers vertically and horizontally. Don't zigzag like you're laying brick becausd it'll fall apart.\n\nIf you aren't sure whether you have enough for a project, then i guarantee you don't. It takes way, way more stone than you would think. You will have about a third of it leftover after you've picked and chosen.\n\nStart with a very small project because it is labor intensive and you want to complete a project in a reasonable timeframe. For a retaining wall be sure to allow a route for water to pass through drains in or under the wall or hydristatic pressure will collapse it.\n\nFeel free to get in touch with any specific questions you may have.",

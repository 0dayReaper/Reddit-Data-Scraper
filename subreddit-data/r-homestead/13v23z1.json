Trying to figure out a way to mow less and sheep seem like a reasonable way to do it.\n\nMy main questions are:\n1. I\u2019m not entirely sure what grass is growing, can they survive on fescue/Kentucky blue or does it need to be something specific.\n\n2. I\u2019m not wanting to keep them over the winter bc I don\u2019t want to have to get hay. Is there a good meat variety that I could get in early spring and then process in November/December?",

They eat most anything.. since I have neither of those grasses.. IDK, I suspect it would be fine. The area is fenced they graze as they please. My fence is nothing fancy. I used bamboo to make a \"Split rail\" type fence.\n\nIn Barbados they are grown for their meat..as to eating.. ummm I don't really eat. \ud83d\ude04 I more of a breeder sell my youngins. Have eaten and it's good.\n\nIMHO the ewes would be great around kids. The girls are gentle. If u hand raise..( meaning lots of human contact when young) they can be a great learning tool for the kids.\n\nI have two acres it's not clear cut. But my 5 girls keep it clean. It's also due to that we have been in a long drought, so nothing is growing. Before the sheep the same area was extremely difficult to walk thru.\n\nWith hay, to me it's no big deal. I just buy one of those giant wheels. As long as I keep it dry no mold grows. I use a 4 pallets to build a shelter around. Cover with a tarp. \n\nNothing hard. \n\nGood luck.",

I plan on buying land out of town when I graduate college next year. But with my small yard I  love my reel mower. I just pick up the sticks first(I burn them and spread the ashes in garden) then I mow with it, takes maybe 30 mins at most. When I had a push mower that was gas it took me 30 minutes to start the thing sometimes. Had to replace pull cords often, change blades, etc. with my reel mower it\u2019s easier in my opinion. Haven\u2019t done any maintenance in two years and it\u2019s still going strong. I do use an electric weed eater around my bushes and when I get behind and it gets grown up though(or I release my 6 hens upon the grass, that works too).",

If you mow it wet, you're more likely to clog the mower with giant chunks of wet grass that will proceed to ferment or dry into concrete (I hate petty yard work so much). \n\nWalking the yard before mowing is a drag, but it's much more time consuming and costly to replace a window the mower shot a rock through.",

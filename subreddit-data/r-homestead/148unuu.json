My guess is because if they were to have baby chicks, it makes way more sense to have baby chicks during the summer than in the winter. During the winter, they just stop. Plus, they need to take a break. \n\nFake eggs/gold balls/empty egg (use a nail, poke a hole, time + water, then microwave the shell) though, are also how you can get hens to lay in other nesting boxes besides just the 1 that they all chicken yell about because someone is already in there.",

Ever seen what rats will do to your feed bin?  Snakes help with that.\n\nAt the end of the day their pluses FAR and I mean FAR outweigh their negatives.  Rat &amp; corn snakes &amp; milk &amp; king snakes and pretty much all other non venomous snakes are welcome in my chicken pen and around my place.  Unfortunately, I can't leave the venomous ones be, too many kids and too many animals that can be bitten and die or suffer.",

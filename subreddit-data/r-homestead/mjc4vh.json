Talking to others who own sheep, especially others that have small herds like yourself, should give you some shearer\u2019s names - Facebook can be helpful too. \n\nAs for processing the fibre, it sounds as though u/Then_Independent932 is talking about hand spinning - which definitely has its merits and makes a different character of yarn to commercially-spun yarns, but is probably only viable for a fleece or two at a time. If you want larger volumes done you\u2019re probably best looking for a spinning mill, although there are huge variations in what each mill will process and how, and you might be limited by the variation of wools within your herd. A quick search on google gives a few mills in your state - but be aware that most mills will accept fibre shipped to them so you could also probably go to an out-of-state mill too. Again, talking to others for recommendations might help. \n\nAs for what you\u2019re looking for with a mill, your best bet first is to talk to the mills themselves. Whenever potential clients phone my mill we\u2019re always happy to chat about fibre and give guidance about their wool. It\u2019ll give you an idea of minimum batch sizes (some mills can do very small batches of a couple of fleeces, others will have a minimum of c. 20kg or so, some will need &gt; 100kg which will likely be far too much for you), products they can do (just knitting yarn? Weaving yarn that you could then send to a weaving mill for finished items to be made? Other craft items?), and the type of spinning they can do: woollen or worsted. Woolen spinning is fluffy, typically not particularly strong (although that can vary with fibre type), and quite \u2018open\u2019/not dense as far as fibre arrangement goes. Worsted spinning produces a very sleek, uniform yarn that tends to be stronger and more dense - worsted spinning can also produce finer yarns than woollen. I would personally recommend worsted for your wool, assuming they\u2019re all of the Icelandic/Gotland-y type of fibre (versus, say, Shetland which is very springy). \n\nI hope that helps! Happy to talk some more about it if you\u2019d like.",

Not looking to get rich but wouldn\u2019t want to lose money on it. Can you give me a ballpark what it costs to process a fleece to roving or yarn? I was trying to read on one mills site and my lack of understanding terminology is making it hard to know what all needs to happen but it was looking like $20-30 per pound to end up with a finished product. Is that true?\n\nOne of the reasons I picked up wool sheep is also because I\u2019m interested in tanning fleeces in the future",

It isn\u2019t cheap, I recognise that, but coming from someone in the industry: it takes a lot of work and expertise to take raw wool and make it into yarn. \nMarketing is your best friend when it comes to making your money back: people love to know the provenance of their wool. They want to know which farm it came from, and if possible they want to know which individual sheep it came from. A bit of farm history, info on the flock or sheep, and a nice photo will mean you can tack an extra $10 on the price of a ball of wool. Artisan, locally-made yarn with provenance should already fetch a decent price. Look at your run-of-the-mill ball of acrylic yarn and quadruple the price, at minimum. \n\nIf that all seems too daunting or just simply something you don\u2019t want to get into - you can always sell raw fleece to crafty people. You won\u2019t make a ton of money, but it\u2019ll cover the cost of the shearer. Again, provenance and marketing will be your friend with getting a decent price.",

My other ewe that is the same mix has very different wool. Longer and fuller. I only just got these sheep this year so I haven\u2019t had time to make any plans for the wool yet. Just focusing on lambing and getting their pasture rotation figured out. The lady I bought them from was a hand spinner though and was breeding for wool quality https://i.imgur.com/a7qEByL.jpg https://i.imgur.com/ImuXjOc.jpg",

With a carefully controlled diet you will get the nice yellow coloration, with a diet of whatever they catch or scratch up the yolk gets the gross orangy color.  \n\nMany homesteaders claim the yucky orange color is better, it is almost gospel on this sub, but one must be careful what your chickens eat.  Older farms and homesteads often have long forgotten disposal areas which can contain chemicals that you don't want in your food.  Slugs, ticks, dead mice, old cat litter etc. are just nasty, not something I want in my eggs.  An orange yolk is a warning sign, best stay away.",

Automation, skill, experience, it all all made doing one thing very very well cheaper, which meant more profit per hour of effort, fewer mistakes, fewer injuries, more leisure time, etc. a group of people produces more in general if you have a specialized farmer, teacher, woodcutter, builder, etc, than that same group will produce if everyone has to split their time among those tasks.\n\nCommunities with specialization survived harder times when the jack-of-all trade communities did not.\n\nThus social evolution favored specialization and more and more communities did better and better by adopting it.",

We've got our cherry, apple, peach, and pear tree semi dwarfs in now for two years so hopefully we will bear fruit in the next few years. Lots of berry bushes and other things that will continue to produce every year with minimal work. The chickens are just a small part of the deal. My girlfriend is a chicken freak and has all these special birds that lay various colored eggs and this one breeds with that one to make one of these... Speaking a foreign language to me but I do enjoy all the chicken poop and compost. If I had a little more space I would probably have a dairy cow but we only have about 3 acres and it would be a little tight with all the other structures and activities we have going on. Overall I enjoy it a hell of a lot more than my 12 x 12 garden plot in the city :)",

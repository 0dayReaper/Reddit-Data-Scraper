My husband was leaving the Navy and still had to finish up in Virginia and we just sort of collapsed in our new house in Indiana.  Long story short, Indiana has been good to us.  In my health care field you can earn a good wage here, and taxes and housing are relatively affordable.  So thank you Indiana, you helped us get back on our feet.\n\nWhen I created my Reddit account we were hoping to homestead in Michigan someday but now I'm thinking southern Indiana or Kentucky.  \n\nEnjoy that cabin this Thanksgiving!",

This [one](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2645-E-Macel-Rd-Bloomfield-IN-47424/227904947_zpid/?utm_campaign=iosappmessage&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=txtshare) is on over 5 acres. Not as pretty as the log cabin but super reasonable.",

Plan on staining every 3-5 years depending on sun and weather exposure. The darker the stain the longer the logs will take uv rays. Caulk any larger cracks or any that point down hill towards the inside. I'm only speaking from experience I live in one myself and they are beautiful but need more upkeep than a \"traditional\" home.",

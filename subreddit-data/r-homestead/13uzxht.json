            "comment": "So our family property has a pretty extensive berry population. Not sure exactly what they are but there are 3 different kinds, all reminiscent of blackberries/black raspberries.\n\nI visited for the first time since fall and, being the resident forager/woodsman, realized that a large percentage of them have some sort of rust fungus/double blossom infecting them. The only kind that doesn\u2019t is whatever is pictured last. \n\nWe love getting together and picking berries, eating them, baking, etc. and I hate to see the woods so unhealthy like this. There are berries ALL over the property and I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to spread everywhere, beyond what large chunk is already infected.\n\nIt looks like a lot of spores and blossoms have already opened so I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything I can do at this point in the year but what are the best steps going forward? Pruning? Cutting it all out? Fungicide? Or is this a lost cause?",

That being said, established berries are hardy, even when wild.  You should still get some fruit from them.\n\n I am happy to wait for a more authoritative answer but there are some details missing.  What zone are you in?  Has it been rainy and humid?",

It\u2019s a fungal infection and the only blossoms I\u2019m seeing are on the unaffected areas. \n\nI think it\u2019s less of an airflow problem since the issue is spread through spores and more of an issue of how to go about getting rid of the already infected areas. What time of year would be best, how thorough I need to be, etc.",

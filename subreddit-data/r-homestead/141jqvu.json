It might work to stack wood then add soil if your soil flows really freely while dry, but otherwise you really have to add soil between thin layers of wood to get anything like the claimed hugelkultur effects.",

The new one raised bed I\u2019m assembling now I\u2019m putting the cardboard at the bottom, and chopping the wood more. Will also be throwing the sawdust I\u2019m the wood layer instead of soils layer, as I\u2019ve been taught it locks up nutrients from the soil",

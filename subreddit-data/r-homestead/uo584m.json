            "comment": "Original post from two weeks ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/ucy0zm/what_killed_my_lamb_question_predators/\n\nFinally, we have some closure. The autopsy results from the veterinary pathologist are in and very unfortunately, you guys were right. A human killed my lamb. \n\nThe pathologist did a great job though and was able the give a lot of insight. Head, tail and heart were meticulously removed. The head was not cut off in one swift move but rather removed by layers (skin, muscle, bone). The culprit removed two ribs in order to gain access to the heart. It was most likely done by a self-taught amateur, not a trained professional. It must have taken at least 30 minutes - most likely more - to kill and remove the body parts. \n\nThe pathologist even came all the way to my property to do a reconstruction of events. He brought along a professor of forensic science and two assistants. Apparently they have a cooperation for \"interesting\" cases. So I felt a bit like in CSI. Going over the property, trying to match imprints on the lamb with ground structures, finding clues, profiling, etc. In the end, we were able to draw a few conclusions: \nThe place of death was not the place where I found the lamb. The lamb got caught in the stable (which is available for the sheep at all times even though they are a very hardy breed). It was done by somebody that has never clearly seen my property in daylight. It was most likely one person. It was nothing personal. And a few more. \n\nAs a result, we installed a ton of cameras. I ordered 35 oak posts, fence and barbed wire to strengthen/replace our old fence. We lock all doors at night. The stable is closed for now and the sheep stay on the meadow 24/7 since they have a better chance there to evade any human perpetrators.  \n\nSo long! Stay safe everyone and thanks for your input.\n\nEdit: Police and public prosecution are investigating.",

This has serial killer vibes written all over it. They may be just doing this to animals right now, but many serial killers start there. The ritualistic nature implies this is something they\u2019ve developed and may continue developing. Killing someone else\u2019s animal is already pretty concerning, but if it was a random gun shot or a much simpler killing than that could be attributed to a moment of rage or doing it for sport. This is much more detailed, definitely pre-meditated, and definitely isn\u2019t going to stop with one lamb.",

This comes from a combat veteran and big lover of guns. Look up what in your state legally justifies use of deadly force. Remember a gun is deadly force under prosecution, regardless of personal or property defense it is ruled as such. \n\nSome states do not justify killing someone over property. As bullshit as it can be, some states like CA, MA, NY, CT etc state that if your life or your families lives are not in direct threat, you shooting the thief (can) put you in jail. (You\u2019re not safe from prosecution) For example if a thief comes onto your property unarmed and steals your car, or guts your goat shooting him REGARDLESS OF OUTCOME is not justified, meaning you can very well end up in prison for defending your land. Fucked up I know. \n\nIt\u2019s a very grey area which is why I urge research to anyone reading this. Some states it\u2019s a good to go as animals on a farm are considered a means of income and therefore a threat on your livelihood/means of living. Some states you might as well offer him tea while he butchers your chickens. Any shot fired can be considered attempt to kill, also a very grey area. There are no warning shots even on your own property. Prosecution can use this as a way of you raising the threat to deadly force in your own accord. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason I live where I do now lol.",

I\u2019d even argue theistic Satanists and other niche religious cults wouldn\u2019t do this in practice. Animal sacrifice, while extremely controversial, is a revered, closed practice amongst some faiths- even in Abrahamic ones too. But the animal is carefully selected, always owned, usually specifically bred for such a purpose, and the corpse always honored and salvaged for purpose greater than the whole. I personally don\u2019t subscribe to those traditions and find them generally abhorrent but it would be unfair to not acknowledge that they do exist.\n\nAs a witchy woman myself, I would not only condemn anything like this, but literally every pagan and pentacle loving person that I know would weep at such an act. And as an Internet stranger, I know you just kinda have to take my word for it but witches and pagans alike would be among the most appalled and distressed by this.\n\nGlad the OP is getting security cameras. If this is some sick POS future serial killer I hope they get caught sooner than later. I worry that it\u2019s misguided youth or someone close to OP.",

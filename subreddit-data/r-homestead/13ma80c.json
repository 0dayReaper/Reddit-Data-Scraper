Not a long term solution for sure.\n\nJust keep them outside where they'll be happier anyway and the manure will be welcome fertilizer where it falls.",

They chew stuff like rabbits- wiring, paper, books, furniture.  Super cute, but a pain in the butt.  A full grown sheep, especially when they are ready to be sheared, is a giant and heavy beast that mostly wants food (but a former bottle baby or pet will also demand attention).  They'll knock you or your stuff over and walk on it while they try to decide if it is edible.  A bottle baby or pet will follow you, head butt you, lean on you until you fall down, then walk on you to see if you have anything edible.  They're dumb as stumps and very persistent, and as big as a laz-e-boy.  Don't let them inside unless all of your belongings and furniture are up on a platform and the ground level is just one big empty play space.",

            "comment": "Keep your sheep in a staple, just get them a roof and some walls to protect them from the weather. And we throw some hay and hay dust on the floor every couple of months when we clean their staple so they aren't sleeping on bare wet concrete (you can also use straw or wood chippings). They have a wool coat, so they are ok in the winter and they should be trimmed in spring or summer. You can use the wool in your garden or greenhouse (supposedly it keep some pests like moles away anf it can be used to cover some plants to keep the moisture in the ground)\n[You can read more about that here](https://businesswales.gov.wales/farmingconnect/news-and-events/technical-articles/use-wool-compost-and-other-alternative-applications#:~:text=Sheep%27s%20wool%20offers%20many%20benefits,environmentally%20friendly%20alternative%20to%20peat.) and [here](https://www.gardeningnoob.com/how-to-use-sheep-wool-in-the-vegetable-garden/)\n\nThe only time I'd maybe keep a sheep inside would probably be a newborn lamb with her mother during winter or summer time (if the temperates are extreme), but being away from the heard would probably be stressful for them.",

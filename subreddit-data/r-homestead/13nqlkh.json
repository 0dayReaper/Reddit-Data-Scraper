Easter Eggers bred by a neighbor handle my climate well, and I've been loving the temperament of some rhode island reds I added from the feed store a couple years back. Smart, inquisitive, and a bit less shy of people than the mongrels. \n\nMy birds run around outdoors all day in a very wet climate, so my one hard rule is no feathery feet. Feet-feathers collect balls of mud and snow if the bird goes outside in the winter, which just makes them miserable, and I don't want to sign up for trimming off those feathers whenever they regrow.",

In my experience (I\u2019m no animal scientist) cows do it more for fly control, but they\u2019ll throw their tails straight up if they\u2019re scared kind of like a deer. Pigs will keep their tails curled and waggy when they\u2019re happy or eating but will go slack if they\u2019re concentrating or don\u2019t feel good. It all depends on the animal, but all of my bottle goat babies wag their tails any time I interact with them or when they interact with their goat friends but that\u2019s about it",

It\u2019s nice to have goats that actually look for contact. We live on 5-acres and my dad breeds goats, we usually have anywhere from 20-45+ (most aren\u2019t people friendly) once the kids start popping out haha. He keeps the same male for a while and then changes him out once his first liter is ready to breed. Goats are such vocal animals it\u2019s pretty hilarious when you have a bunch of hungry little ones screaming their heads off to be fed. It\u2019s sad because only 2 of our 10 are females, the males have to be sold to avoid issues as they start getting older.",

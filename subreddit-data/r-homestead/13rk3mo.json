Oregon and have a array of predators in my area so I went with a raised hutch.. 1x2\" welded wire and 1/2\" all around and additional 2x2\" welded wire behind the insulation in the coop/night box. All the wire is nailed with scrap moulding strips.\nThe insulation is foam myler from some food delivery packaging that was on it's way to a landfill \ud83d\ude44..\n\nI scournged and used timber from my property to make it work. I went with a huge, oversize roof to discourage hawks and owls. I set up 2 motion lights around the hutch. I am worried about snakes and may flatten some cans and nail them to the legs maybe to prevent them from climbing up?? \n\nAny tips or tricks from discouraging predators??\nI am licened fur trapper in my State and am pretty aware of sign and the habits of many predators but new to keeping quail.",

Two teen aged girls who babysat me raised quail in their garage in a similar coop. I remember they had an incubator made of red plastic.\n\nAs for the snakes, I wonder if you could use the stuff called \"scat mat\" that is plastic mesh with spikes. It's good at keeping cats from pooping in a garden.\n\nThe best thing we ever had as a defense against snakes was a small beagle mix dog that had short little legs and sharp eyes. He would get between kids and snakes, and bark his head off until an adult came and removed the snake.",

    "postText": "Hello, team! \n\nI've got a sizeable brush pile I created over the winter from clearing some forest area for my orchard, but now I have to process it and utilize it. However, after a couple of stings, I realized some wasps or hornets of some kind have made a nest inside and I'm not sure how to deal with this.\n\n I was considering either buttoning up in full denim armor and sealing my clothing to prevent stings, but that seems a bit impractical considering I'd have to craft some protection for my neck and head. Or, I was thinking I might be able to smoke them out similar to bees by making a simple fragranced smoke bomb, but idk the practicality of that either. Lastly, I'd consider poisoning them with something like Diatomaceous Earth, but I don't believe it works on these fellas as well as ants (might be mixing the compound with borax).\n\nI'd compost the pile or leave it as is for later, but it's in the way of my current work space and I need to deal with it ASAP.  \n\nI appreciate any advice, ideas, thoughts, or conversation on how to deal with this. Thanks!",

But I'm not an expert so please use the recommended advice and solution so you're not at risk.\n\nI had a wasp infestation and wanted to humanely have them moved but was pretty firmly told it's too much risk for someone to aggravate the nests.",

My cousin told me that messing with wasp nests is a way to get seriously hurt or killed if you're unlucky because of the potential size and number, especially since they'll chase you. I'll definitely do some planning of some kind to take them out during the evening or night time, and I may borrow a bee suit from a friend to deal with them. His recommendation was to straight burn it, but I'm not so sure about that. \n\nEither way, I don't want to die or have my week ruined, so I'll be either planning a night time raid at some point with some assistance and thorough planning, or wait until the colony dies over the cooler months. \n\nI'll look into their nest and observe it for a little while to see if I can identify the species and approximate nest location and size, though I know that's a tall order. \n\nThanks for your reply!",

I think I'll try a mixed solution of this and cover their nest in it during the evenings for a week or so. Hopefully, I can get rid of them. I'm trying to stray from synthetic pesticides due to my goals for as natural and organic food production as possible on the property. \n\nIf I remember, I'll return to this post after the wasps are resolved, and I'll share what I did.",

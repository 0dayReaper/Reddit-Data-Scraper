    "postText": "I have to get a new septic system.  Ours is not repairable.  The septic designer said I could peach trees in the drip field with the type of drain field she is specking.  It\u2019s the type for wooded lots because of our oaks.  \n\nBut Google says drain fields end up really salty.  Our septic system was 50 years old and the grass was fine there, but fruit trees are pickier than native grass.  \n\nWe have a water softener.  I would switch to whatever laundry detergent or dishwasher soap I need to. But it\u2019s hard to find resources on what that would actually mean.  \n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt of the article presenting my problem:  Fruit trees are generally salt sensitive and should not be irrigated with water from powdered detergents or other  products containing salts. If your greywater source contains lots of salt (dishwasher detergent, for example, is high in salt), add salt-tolerant plants to your landscape, or irrigate frequently with rainwater to flush salts from the soil. Plants that thrive on recycled or reclaimed water (highly treated wastewater) are good choices for high-salt greywater. It\u2019s best to use plant-friendly products, those low in salts and free of boron, to ensure a good quality irrigation water.\n\nWhat products would allow us to have fruit trees out there?  I don\u2019t know the ingredients of the dishwasher cubes we use.  Which would probably unsettle me too, now that I think about it.\n\nAny advice?  Anyone doing peach trees in the drain field?  Don\u2019t worry - this is not the basic system - they treat it a bit first.  I don\u2019t know a ton about it, but I know it\u2019s a fortune and going to have to be a stupid home improvement loan.  I\u2019d at least like some peaches to show for going back into debt.",

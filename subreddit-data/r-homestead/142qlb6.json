It's beneficial for assisting with chronic allergies, chronic skin issues, jaundice, cirrhosis of the liver, hepatitis, alcoholism, acetaminophen poisoning, and mushroom poisoning. It reduces insulin resistance with type 2 diabetes in cases where cirrhosis of the liver has occurred. It also assists with reducing high cholesterol, reducing the growth of cancer cells in breast, cervical, and prostate cancers, and reducing the liver-damaging effects of chemotherapy and other pharmaceutical drugs. To mow or murder it is like... sacrilege in the world of an herbalist who knows how to work with it to help others. I know my recommendation was funny to put an ad up for herbalists to come and take all, lol, but I can assure you if I was closeby and saw your ad, me and my herbal colleagues would be out there taking it off your hands...

Be careful with 2,4-D around trees though as it can happen or kill them. I usually use a sharpened edge shovel to cut them at the base around trees. Cut them before they flower. You have to make rounds every year and it takes a few years to get them under control. Once under control I just use the shovel method and a few hours every year to keep several pastures clear.\n\n2,4-D concentrates you mix yourself work best but are regulated for purchase. A private applicator license for agriculture is pretty easy to get depending on which state you are in. A training course, state approved test and continuing education credits are required where I live in Texas.",

The issue is the hair will try to repel liquids, so if you get an herbicide make sure you give it a good spray that covers the leaves enough to penetrate past the hair and get to the leaves.  Adding a surfactant to the mix will make that easy, but a heavy application can work without it too.",

It will not harm your grasses, but will kill clover and alfalfa.\n\nBest bet is to go to your local co-op and get it.  I don't know your location, but if there it is a large wheat/barley growing area, they should have it or be able to order it.\n\nYou can do a spray now to start the kill.  Best time to spray thistle is after the first frost in the fall.  \n\n\\*I lived in Minnesota where we had large amounts of Canadian thistle and they were considered noxious weeds.  The county would fine you if you had them in your fields, pastures or even lawns.\\*",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve had chickens about 5 years and started as free range, got destroyed by hawks. Then I put up a fence and clipped a wing. They still got over. Hawks and raccoons got them when they wouldn\u2019t come in at night. Then I built some fence panels and wrapped them in chicken wire. Covered the top in chicken wire as well. Raccoons pushed through and destroyed my chickens in about a week. After probably 50 chickens, I decided to beef up the run and I couldn\u2019t be happier. It\u2019s about 16x24 with a 6x6 coop.",

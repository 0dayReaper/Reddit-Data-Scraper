    "postText": "An old, neglected hay field connects my backyard to the woods. I have managed to rough-cut it and am now mowing it regularly. The grass there is stiff with wide blades but as I mow it is beginning to give way to softer native stuff. \n\nI would like to convert this field to native clover as it's easy to maintain and comfortable to traverse. We haven't decided how to use it yet but I want it walkable. Is my best course of action to spread native clover seed immediately after mowing? Advice appreciated",

You need freezing nights and above freezing days for the ground to heave.  I found college agriculture studies that say you only get ~30% germination with this method.  If the current grass is fescue, you will not out compete it with anthing unless you terminate it and then sow your clover.  No-till people hate plowing and most everyone hates roundup, but in my opinion you'll have to do one or the other to end up with a field of nothing but clover.",

Old timers say any month with an \"R\" in it will be good.  My local FSA office rents a no till seed drill to local land owners for hayfields and hunting food plots.  I would rent that and sow the recommended rate of clover for mixed grass.  I believe it's around 4-6 pounds per acre.  You might also use a disc to rough it up a little, sow the seed, then lightly disc again.  Not sure what equipment you have access to.",

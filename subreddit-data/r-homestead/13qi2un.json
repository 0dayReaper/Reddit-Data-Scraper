Sat in its side, with a wooden entrance, this in turn is sat on the concrete block \"plinth\" the rats can't scale the sides, coz its round &amp; slippery, its too high to leap up to the wooden front, the only way they were previously getting was via my chicken ladder! Even when I modified the ladder to just rest on a single upright post the rats still managed it! Crafty bugger's! This so far has kept them at bay...\ud83e\udd1e",

Wooden form to attach front &amp; doorway. Perch's inside are all removable. Also has a light inside for mite eradication regime. 15 mins on 45 mins off during darkness time. The science behind it indicates that the mites rely on the darkness to attack the chickens.but when the light comes on, they scurry back away to hide again, my chickens do not have any red mite at all! And are happier &amp; healthier for it. I've been checked over by an inspector &amp; he was amazed we did not have any mites in the coop or on the chickens even! I steam clean it once twice a year &amp; most other times it just gets a scrape out &amp; new sawdust or wood shavings to soak up the droppings.",

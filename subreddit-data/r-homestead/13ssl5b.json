    "postText": "Bought our first coop about 6 weeks ago, and it\u2019s been a blast, I\u2019m pretty sure I ended up with a single Roo, I don\u2019t want to cull the guy, not his fault he was born a boy. But I also don\u2019t want him with our laying hens when the time comes. The coop we have can easily accommodate the 5 hens, minus 1 rooster. \n\nSo that brings me to a few days ago, I grabbed some scrap lumber from my father in law and fashioned what could be an extension run for the laying hens, but now I\u2019m thinking I could use that run for meat chickens, say 3-4 Cornish Hens, this one Gold Wyandotte Roo, let the hens raise their chicks and use them as meat Chickens. The question I have is obviously Cornish hens have a quick turn around rate, how much would the Wyandotte cross slow that down, and can I leave said Rooster permanently living with the hens and chicks?",

            "comment": "A Cornish cross usually doesn't survive to adulthoood - if you want to breed meat chickens, you need two different breeds (that's the 'cross' part of the cornish cross) to get the genetic abnormality that makes meat chickens grow so quickly (and then die of heart failure if you don't butcher them). This is why some people prefer raising heritage breeds for meat. \n\nIf you have a problem eating this rooster, though, why are you looking to get into meat chickens? I can tell you from experience that wyandotte roos make perfectly nice roasts, even if they aren't quite as meaty as a Cornish cross (mine are usually around 3 lbs, and I get 6 meals worth of meat off them).\n\nIf you don't want to eat him, just leave the roo in with the girls. Fertilized eggs don't start developing until a hen or an incubator starts the 'setting' process (they're closer to how plant seeds work than to mammal babies), so they're the same to eat as unfertilized ones. He'll keep any bully hens from causing too much trouble to the others, sort out flock integration so you don't have to replace all the hens at once over time, and keep an eye out for danger.",

            "comment": "Just leaving a rooster among the hens isn't likely to result in chicks.  Broodiness is more of an occasional individual personality trait in most hens, and not super common in many breeds.  If you collect your eggs regularly you'll never have accidental chicks anyways.",

The lack of legal, available logging has caused extreme fires making air quality in the western states horrible. This drives up lumber prices while thousands of acres of potential lumber burn. People in these states have been flocking to other, normally conservative western states in terms of climate and economic approach. Florida has also seen a spike of California refugees. With Silicon Valley migrants working from home and having the opportunity to move to more desirable locales while maintaining their inflated salaries, cost of living across the board for established families in traditionally less sought after locations has skyrocketed while income for those families has remained stagnant.",

Fire management has been messed up for over 100 years and that's been publicly recognized as an issue.   Climate change has created drier and hotter conditions exacerbating everything (like beetle kill?). Logging regulations are such a small piece of the puzzle.  Lumber prices are high because the mills all cut production at the start of covid not thinking that we would have a boom of building activity. \n\nPeople are leaving western states and that's a good thing, places like the Bay Area are overgrown and they are assholes about building new housing and won't build proper density. But people are also still moving to the west in droves. It's not some left/right politics battle like you make it out, it's far more complicated.",

The real culprit is climate change increasing drought and East to west wind events that turn sparks into conflagrations.  And as we know, clear-cut logging not only contributes to climate change causing emissions, but it greatly damages the carbon storage cycle.",

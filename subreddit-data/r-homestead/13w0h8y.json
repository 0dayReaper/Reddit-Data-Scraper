How much would I need to save up to start a hobby farm? I was thinking about \u00a350 000 at the very least (based in the UK) for a downpayment on some land, but I don't even know where I would look for that? What career is best to suit someone who wants to have a hobby farm? An online job, I would presume - but which one? Hoping to set up some sort of post-graduation plan - how did everyone begin their homesteading journey?",

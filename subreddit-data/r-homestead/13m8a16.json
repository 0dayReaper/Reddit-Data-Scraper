            "comment": "Ducks need pools of water &amp; are very messy, geese need pools of water too, both need grass to graze on. Chickens are less messy, when its dry, in winter will they can wreck a pasture / meadow, depending on rainfall. They dont need pools of water, but need water to drink obviously. I have kept a couple of small ornamental ducks, in our vegetables garden, very good at slug / snail control, still needed a pool or pond of water. Less messy than regular ducks. Geese do make excellent guard dogs, very alert &amp; territorial. But can be quite friendly if reared from young. Hope this helps...",

            "comment": "What is your end goal and what do you have to offer poultry?  If you want meat and eggs and bug reduction, chickens are easiest.  If you have nice  pond and want it to be filled with crap, ducks are a good choice (they are good meat but hard to pluck, their eggs are good but they do not lay as steadily as chickens).  If you have a nice pond to mess up and neighbors, children or small pets to terrorize, geese are the way to go.  Not only will they poop all in and around your water feature providing the same slick-greasy-shit-scape as ducks, but they're smarter and bigger (and lay fewer eggs) and they are often aggressive.  You can raise them as loving pets, but they'll be aggressively loving, which is not always what a person is looking for when they are looking for love.",

            "comment": "I have ducks. They are Khaki Campbells and are not noisy. Lay almost an egg a day.  They free range but go back in a barn at night.  I have a pond but they don\u2019t go there anymore.  They didn\u2019t pollute the pond as it has good flow through but it was hard to get them off of it and in the barn.  They abandoned it when one duck was killed. They are  happy with a puddle in the yard like runner ducks as they are partly bred from runners.  The barn basement is full of duck poo.  It doesn\u2019t smell great but not horrible.  I clean it out every few months wearing a respirator so I smell nothing.  The yard is not messy although they do probe the wet spots pretty well. \n\nI used to have eight but now have one drake and four hens which is perfect for egg production. I don\u2019t eat the ducks as I shoot well over 100 wild ducks annually.",

            "comment": "I have a few pekins, duclairs, and white layer ducks. They like their space and walking together making it easy to rear them. I would say the white layers aren't as hardy as the other breeds but generally are easier to keep than chickens. Restricting their water accessibility will keep their area clean and mud free. Giving a safe spot to lay eggs will reward you with clean poop free eggs as well.",

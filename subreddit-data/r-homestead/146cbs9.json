    "postText": "I have some store bought organic russet potatoes and I want to sprout them so I can plant them in a grow bag for later harvest. I have brown paper bags as well as red onions (not organic) and apples (not organic). How can speed up the sprouting process to begin planting ASAP. Also, how do I avoid Solanine poisoning if applicable?",

            "comment": "The easiest way to sprout a tayto would be letting it sprout in the sun, but that does make solanine because the potato itself is starting to photosynthesize so it would end up only being a seed for the potatoes. I find after planting the harvest doesn't really care the seed was green. Otherwise you could put it near other fruits. The gases the fruit release to ripen themselves can speed the potatoes as well. Honestly if you keep the soil a little moist then the potatoes should do their thing. Hope this helps!",

            "comment": "I've had luck with planting them in the dark. Sprouting or not, planted in just lightly damp soil, in the dark (with just a sliver of sunlight if possible), seems to work great to start potatoes. Just letting them sit and forget about them. In no time, you'll get sprouts popping up. Done this the last couple of years with great success.",

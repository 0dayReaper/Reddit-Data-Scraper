After doing some research I found that I can have a horse stabled in a nearby stables for just a few hundred \u00a3 a month (don\u2019t worry, I realise I don\u2019t know anything. I have a lot of learning to do and I will not even consider getting a horse without at least 2 years of lessons.) \n\nI would love to have my own fresh milk and make my own dairy products so I was wondering if anyone keeps their own cows stabled? \n\n\nWhat I means is that the horse stable advertises that they turn the horse out and take it in and keep its area habitable for the minimum fees and do some more care for extra fees. Is there anywhere that will do that with your own cow? Is that a stupid idea?",

            "comment": "I feel like you'd be better to find someone dairy farming (perhaps organically) near you, and ask if you can buy a share of their herd. Could work out much the same as buying a cow of your own assuming you're not taking a full cow worth of milk everyday and that they can keep/sell the excess. \n\nThis gets you around the legalities of buying \"farm fresh\" unpasteurized/non-homogenized milk seeing as you actually already own 'some' of the cow(s). \n\nThese legalities exist due to non-trivial health concerns stemming from the bacteria present or potentially present in cow-fresh milk, which can cause major upset for the unaccustomed gut. You can become accustomed easily enough should you choose.\n\nIf those legalities don't present a problem for you, you could likely just buy milk direct from the farm instead, which would be a lot simpler. \n\nOwning a cow is only the start of things if you want milk. You'll need a milking setup including storage, cleaning and refrigeration, and someone to milk her every day. Usually twice a day. Medical treatments if she gets mastitis, or goes lame for some reason. And grazing, or appropriate feed depending on location and season.\n\nCows are social animals, and parking one in a stall in a stable by herself just isn't going to work.",

Smaller animals mean less space needed, less food, less poop, a manageable amount of milk production, easier to transport, and safer in general to be around. Fresh goat milk is amazing and you can do nearly anything with goat milk that you can with cow milk, plus it's better for you. Goats are also fun as heck. Obviously do your research before getting them, but they are just a delight. \n\nI absolutely do not want to discourage you from getting animals!

Aside from that consideration, sure, there is probably a small farmer or homesteader who would be happy to 'stable' your cow with their own, so she's have company, shelter, pasture and people even though she was not at your home. \n\n What benefit do you get from owning a cow that you do not get milk or manure from, and who is not eating your grass or asking you for treats?  I don't know if there's any practical purpose to boarding a cow elsewhere unless you already have a beloved cow and just can't keep her where you live.  You can usually just buy fresh milk or a milk share from a small farmer or homesteader who keeps cows.  You'd drop in and buy milk a couple of times a week, maybe including a visit to their cows, and have none of the vet or feed bills to worry about.",

While they can help you with the actual handling of a horse/cow, that tends to leave many other bases uncovered.\n\nI'd find a non-profit where you can volunteer.  Maybe a rescue or a therapeutic riding stable.  They always need volunteers, and usually, you can work your way up the ladder of responsibilities.  \n\nIt gives you experience with a variety of horses (which is honestly really important if you actually want to learn horsemanship), helps a program that benefits society, and you know you're getting info that must be somewhat decent if they are keeping a herd alive. Plus, you're in an environment where people love to talk animals and will answer your questions.\n\nAnother good option is finding a community college with classes in animal husbandry.  The classes tend to have low to non-existent entry requirements and to be relatively cheap (definitely cheaper than weekly lessons over 2 years).\n\nHope this info is at least relevant!",

Your biggest hurdle would be keeping it contained on your property as they are the Houdini of the animal kingdom, but for the price of stud fee once a year, you get a freshened doe &amp; at least one kid.  Goat meat is DELICIOUS, especially young goat.  You also get all of the bushes, poison ivy and small trees branches cleared out as high as the doe can reach on her hind legs.",

            "comment": "don't know the specifics on cows as far as milking goes, but from an ethical standpoint considering cows, like horses, are herd animals meant to roam and graze- it would be incredibly cruel to keep them in a stall, let alone with no company of the same species. no matter what anyone says, no cow or horse on this earth is content with being kept inside stalls, even if its \"only\" half the day. i usually relate it to keeping a dog in a crate for the same periods of time to put it into perspective.\nno hate or hard feelings to you at all op, its just something i find requires extreme stress of importance, because an alarming number of people who keep these animals would try and argue otherwise lol\nthe three Fs to keep in mind: Freedom, Forage and Friends- all the bare minimum requirements to keeping a horse or cow happy and safe. freedom to roam, consistent access to forage to graze on, and friends to live and bond with",

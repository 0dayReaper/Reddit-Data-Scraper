Have a garden tractor but looking for something for bigger jobs. No animals yet but kids want to move their horses from parents farm to our new place. Will have chickens and sheep within a year. Don\u2019t have 40k to spend. Was hoping to keep it under 20. Preferably 10-15.",

Sat on Kijiji for a year waiting for a good deal, eventually got a Belarus 611 with cab, loader, and snow blower for 5k (Can). It's old, it's basic but it's already paid for itself just in clearing the drive in winter. And in many cases you can fix things with scavenged parts and a decent hammer. \n\nMy opinion on tractors go new and expensive, or go really old basic and cheap. It's the middle ground where things go wrong but you can't fix them yourself.\n\nNote: many will say this is terrible advice and and it did have risks, but it worked for me.",

The same price range tractor I can find is a bagged out jd with a fel from the 50\u2019s. Also worth mentioning. I apprenticed as a heavy duty mechanic for a lot of years and then went back to school to become a mechanical engineer. So I can fix or build anything g that\u2019s pre 80\u2019s",

You might be able to get a great deal if you\u2019re comfortable purchasing from an Auction and you might actually find an auction close to you.  I highly recommend a skid steer on tracks or a backhoe loader with less than 3-4k hours. Also, attachments are very common in auctions and can be purchased for a steal. If you\u2019re looking for another tractor check out TYM especially if you have dealer support close by.",

            "comment": "We moved into a 40 acre property of aspen/pine/spruce forest in Alberta and the only piece of equipment we had for the first year and a half was a side by side. We both drive 4x4s and it didn't snow enough the first winter to force the issue on snow moving, but worst case scenario we could have slapped a plough on it or asked a neighbor for help if the snow situation got real bad. \n\nWe skidded logs, moved dirt (dump bed) and obviously ran around on the property on that thing. I didn't want to buy a plough because I knew I was going to buy something else asap. \n\nWe ultimately decided on a skid steer because I wanted something strong but also compact enough to get into the forest, and a cab for snow clearing at -30. Tractors that were in that 40-50hp range were too big to get into the forest the way I wanted. We also have a fair bit of construction type landscaping to do. \n\nThat being said, we know people that do everything but hay their mixed pasture/forest 160 acres with a 25hp Kubota BX. Their property had a 1km driveway and they clean it with a front mounted snowblower. I also know people that bought the 45hp tractor and are mad because it's not big enough to lift a round bale. \n\nObviously, the type of work you want to do will really decide on what tools you need. You may find yourself in a situation where a couple smaller investments may be better than a do everything single machine. Or batch up some jobs that use the same tool and rent it for a weekend.\n\nPrices have been pretty gross for the past 3ish years....everything went up 30% or more due to exchange as well as supply issues and demand. They've come down a bit but not as fast as they went up. Used prices seem to have gone up as much, or even more than, new prices. The best option, if you can manage it, is to put yourself in a situation where you can make due until you can find the right tool at the right price.",

We looked around until we found a Case 375 with a 6 way blade for $7500.  I put new hoses on it and it's awesome.   My brother-in-law liked it so much that he shopped around and found one with a winch and rake for $8500.   Skid steers and big tractors are too popular to be cheap.  Good luck.",

It was fine and easy to maneuver in woods.  \n\nI bought my neighbor\u2019s home and land almost 4 years ago.  Now I have 115 acres about 20 acres to mow and is takes FOREVER and is a huge chore.  \n\nIf doing over I would get 55-60 hp to run a larger mower and more bucket payload. \n\nI\u2019m keeping my little tractor and likely buying a 120hp to to run a batwing.  I\u2019ve been in the fence a bit as I need to get a new building up before I buy any more stuff. I\u2019m anticipating adding 110 neighboring acres at some point.",

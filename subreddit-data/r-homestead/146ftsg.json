Ten acres of the scrubby side of a mountain will not have the same carrying capacity as ten acres of rich bottomland pasture. So your question really has no answer that could actually help you. You can only answer it once you have a piece of land.\n\nIn west Texas with 15-20in rain annually it would be 20 acres per horse/cow. In east Texas with 40in rain it could be 5. In my area I would want 20 acres minimum for that many animals and even that would be tight.",

If you don't have a drought you can expect a pretty good carrying capacity. Though of course just because 40 is the average doesn't mean that always happens. My county's average is 37 but I expect 25 or 30. Plan for 30, not 40, in your estimates.\n\nI would do 8 acres per horse/cow and 1 acre per sheep, assuming decent rotational management. If you have a great year and have too much grass you can always hay it. It is always better to have too much than too little if you can afford it.",

With five acres you could do a small herd of sheep, 5 ewes and a ram, but I wouldn't recommend a horse or cows. You would be feeding too much supplemental hay and their much larger feet tear up land more. Do you have your heart set on these specific animals? If so, why?\n\nBlackland prairie is good land and it is expensive. We bought our property for $8k/acre 10 years ago and I will tell you that was overpaying for what we got. The ridiculous tax people just tried to assess it at $44k/acre this year. If you want Blackland you will pay for it. \n\nThough do your research because counties vary a lot in prices, property taxes, and minimum land size for ag exemption. Most Texas counties require 12+ acres in order to apply for ag exemption, so I would try my hardest to get 12+ acres! It could take a tax bill from $2500 to $25. No joke. Every county is different when it comes to what they demand to get an ag exemption so definitely do your research. Find out what the locals say about their appraisal office. But the ag exemption is totally worth it if you can do it.\n\nI also want you to be aware that military veterans have a percentage off their property taxes in accordance with their percent disability, if any. So a 60% disabled vet gets 60% off their property taxes in Texas. Don't know if you are a vet, just thought you should know if you don't.",

Horses are crazy expensive to feed, especially show quality ones, and even more expensive to show. Not that you can't of course, but some animals are more of a financial burden than others, and no other livestock is so much that as a horse. Just be aware. If she wants to go ahead with showing horses, I personally feel like she should take some financial responsibility with it. But that's just my opinion. :)\n\nYou could keep one Jersey milk cow with a handful of sheep (for companionship) on 12 acres. Or, if you are not adverse to goats, just do milk goats and show them. No sheep no cows, just goats. You get a lot of good milk and animals your kids can 4H easily. Goats are a bit trickier to keep compared to sheep or cows, but once you know those tricks they can be quite a joy. The stocking rate for goats would be the same as sheep. Bonus if you have a lot of shrubbery, goats love that.",

Check with your local ag office. Where we are, 40 acres is the minimum for a cow/calf pair without supplemental feeding but also requires additional water.",

Some states will only allow like 1 cow per 2 acres or 20 chickens per acre, etc.  So even if sources say 5 acres is the minimum you could do, the state may tally up to 8 acres depending on AU guidelines.\n\nedit:  found it!  [https://landassociation.org/how-many-cows-per-acre-in-texas-get-the-stocking-rate-for-your-area/](https://landassociation.org/how-many-cows-per-acre-in-texas-get-the-stocking-rate-for-your-area/) but you'll want to calculate that for each animal and factor in whether or not the state allows for overlap of those units.  Like if it says 2 acres per cow and 1 acre per horse, can the horse share with the cows on the same 2 acres or does it need to be 3?  Most places the answer is 3, I believe but could be wrong.",

You can get way more bang for you buck if you go out off the I-30 corridor.\n\nFeel free to hit me up with questions... I'm an ecologist in the area and just bought land there last year after years of searching.",

And my husband has a job currently in the DFW area. I will message you if I can think of anything specific. I am feeling a bit overwhelmed with this in general because I guess I never just realized how many more things I needed to consider when actually moving forward with it. But also not jumping into it and just buying land and hoping it works and making sure I fully prepare myself. Rather than being in a position where we can\u2019t do anything and have to wait and sell and buy again",

Does anyone have anything super unique or nifty composting hacks?\n\nI personally have a worm farm (see pic) but there are so many options \ud83e\udeb1\n\nTBH I think composting is an absolute must-have for any homestead so would love to hear people's takes on it!\n\nIf you don't compost yet or want to learn more about it, I've also made a bunch of resources on my website [here](https://montycompost.co/blogs/all-posts) or just DM me \ud83d\ude0a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c738zx6ryb4b1.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9d0b9c6a6e8a2b2397731451d251017ec3d2782a",

When we lived in the city we utilized a diy tumbler setup and harvested many accidental meal worms from that for fishing, and that was pretty cool. Now we are homesteading on acres and have two large bays setup for rotation to help with the big garden.",

We're in the NM desert and there aren't a ton of methods that seem like they would handle our massive daily temp swings well.  Plus the general dryness of our climate could be an issue.  So in bed composting seems to be the answer.  Possible even in bed worm farms once things are farther along.\n\nI also basically get free, unlimited cow dung because we're in a fence them out state with busted fences.  So I'll probably have just a pile of that somewhere, aging.",

I have a compost bin that's basically a big black box that doesn't rotate. It so much easier with the drill attachment to stir the compost instead of trying to fight with a shovel in a small space.\n\nI also made a 3 bay compost bin out of some wood pallets (it looks like 2 E's from above) the other day. I'll be using that to rotate compost piles so that I'm not throwing new stuff into finished compost. It's in the chicken pasture too so hopefully chickens help with aerating and mixing it.",

This meant There was maybe 10 cu ft. of compost available every two weeks. \n\nI would take away pile #6 and pick out anything big (usually blackberry cane) to put at the bottom of pile #1, the turn everything into its new spot and start a new pile. This meant the local microbes etc. would go from the big chunks of the old compost into the new.\n\nI got many lbs of coffee grounds from local coffee places, and a lot of veg. material, sawdust etc from other places. Plus cleaning the chicken coop, but that didn\u2019t happen too often.",

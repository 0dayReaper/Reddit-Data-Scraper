That happened in 84 after selling the schoolhouse property. I built my stead from mostly native and recycled materials for $3500. That ten became 50 acres and we\u2019re still here. Good luck to all you young pups carrying on the tradition. I envy your youth. I love our stead. \n\nWe have a FB page for our place. Facebook.com/lilacmoonshire.",

There are of course times where I long for a \u201creal\u201d home but we make it work really well. zoning in VT where the yurt is now, allowed for the yurt. There was a septic system where we\u2019re leasing the land so we have a quarter slice of the yurt dedicated to a bathroom and shower and sink. We have a Woodstove in the middle but also a back up propane heater for when/ if we leave during cold months. Living in one room has its challenges and we\u2019ve definitely learned how to be \u201calone\u201d while together in the same room. Ours is 25\u2019 across! I\u2019ll try and post some pics of it at some point soon!!",

With thin walls and roof we can hear everything outside;every owl hoot, coyote yip, wind blow or rain drop. It\u2019s one of the best parts of the yurt. We\u2019re totally warm in the winter and in fact struggle more with heat in the summer, having no air conditioning. Moisture is bit tricky and when we rebuild I plan on putting our bathroom in a separate small bathhouse to minimize moisture in the yurt. Hope this helps!!",

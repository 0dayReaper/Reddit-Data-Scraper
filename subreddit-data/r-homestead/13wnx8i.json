Is this something you all would be interested in? Our team has built an **off grid simulator**, we call it the **Land Lab Simulator** (Beta is complete) which allows you to drag and drop off grid systems, input your location, and it will let you know how each off grid system will perform. It also has DIY tutorials for each system, or a link to purchase them, along with AI weather implementation, warnings, zoning alerts, budgeting plans, and many more features. After great feedback from the beta we have launched a **kickstarter for the official Version one of the app**. Feel free to check it out and watch the video on the kickstarter!

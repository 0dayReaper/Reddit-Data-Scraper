I'm going to go do some research, I genuinely thought there was something substantially different all these years. I grew up showing dairy cows (not on my own property - I \"borrowed\" with a 4H program) and some of the farmers I knew owned beef cattle too; from them I always got the impression that beef cows were useless for milk. Because these were large-scale operations, they probably just weren't concerned about waste-not-want-not, though, so for them it was likely not a wise investment of time to milk 400 beef cows.",

Typically if you keep the bull with the cows he stays pretty calm.  By themselves, if scared, they are destructive as all get out.\n\nYou'll also find that your herd has a pecking order.  You have a lead cow, and others follow her, including the bull.  It's a hoot once you figure it out.  She will be the first to stop grazing and lay down in the afternoon, the first to get up to graze in the evening.  The first to go to drink, etc.\n\nThat head butting and shoving they do occasionally is them establishing their pecking order.  They will tend to do things in that order.\n\nAlso, if you give them sack feed, pellets, cubes etc.  They will learn to love you.  The best way to get them in the pen is to buy some feed, go out in the pasture and dump it out in a line long enough for everybody to eat.  Then call them.  Any old way you want.  Do that for a couple of days and they will come to you once they see you have food.  If you have a pick-up or utv, just put the sack on the tailgate and they will follow you right into the pen.\n\nThe #1 rule when handling cattle is to keep them calm.  Slow and steady so they don't feel threatened.  This goes for getting them in a pen for preg checks, wormer, of if you have one that needs attention.  Easiest is to get them all in the pen by luring them with that sweet, sweet sack feed and then let everybody else but the one you want out.\n\nThey really are quite gentle creatures.  Big and mean looking, but once they get used to you, some will even want to check you out or lick you and such.  Treated well they are giant pets.\n\nExcept the bull.  A worked up bull is bad news.  They will jump gates, unsuccessfully, and then just crush the gate and walk on.  However, some bulls are quite docile.  We had angus and always had a registered angus bull.  Our last one was a 2000 monster, but he was as friendly and gentle as can be.  Almost too friendly as he would sneak up behind you in the pen and head butt you in the rear end.  Of course he could knock you down just by shaking his head.  Old Fred used to come to the fence whenever he would see us to say hello and get his head scratched.\n\nI've herd horror stories about other bulls, so it depends on their temperament. My old man always picked \"pushers\" instead of \"jumpers.\"  When he walked into the pen with a yearling bull, if it rared it's head up when startled he didn't want it.  His \"pushers\" were the ones that put their head down and pawed at the ground.  Kind of like you see them doing in the pasture when they are head butting each other.\n\nThere's also the swirl thing.  Cattle have a swirl of hair on their face. Sometimes it's above the eyes, sometimes between the eyes, sometimes below.   You want between the eyes or below.  They will be more gentle.  Not kidding, it's been tested by universities.  Something about that developing along with their nervous system, it it's above the eyes they are more jittery and nervous.\n\nSo there's the extent of my knowledge of cattle.  If you never see them for weeks, they become quite wild.  If they see you every day, they become used to people and won't care if you walk right up to them.  Keep in mind little kids trains show cows, calves, etc. and they are as gentle with their handlers as can be.  They just have to get to know you and know you are not a threat.\n\nNo whips or hot shots.  That'll make them not like you so much.  Much better to ply them with treats when you want them to go somewhere.  If they get all fired up, you need to let them calm down before moving them, otherwise you'll have cattle scattered all over the neighborhood.",

Typically the calf nurses the cow for about 6 to 8 months, then you wean them and vaccinate them, and them send them off to the sale barn for somebody else to finish.\n\nMy great grandfather, grandfather and father were all cattle men.  My dad preferred cow/calf.  I think those cows were big old pets to him.   Our calves always sold for top dollar.  Many times cattle finishers would buy them right off the farm before we took them to the sale barn.",

I was raised on a farm with a 100 head cow/calf operation.  50 spring calvers and 50 fall calvers.  We sold feeder steers and heifers.\n\n My grandfather and great grandfather were cattle men as well.  Worked on the farm until age 22, when I went off to college. Left my corporate engineering job and came back 20 years later when the old man got cancer to help him out and owned cows with him.  \n\nOn our farm we only had one set of pens to work cattle.  The spring herd was about a half mile down the road, so pretty much twice a year we had to move them on the road.  The method we used all those years was as I described.  We'd bait them and call them up to the gate for a couple of days, then they would follow the pickup down the road with a feed sack on the tailgate.  Me and my son, who started helping when he was 6 would follow along behind on foot to keep the ones that wanted to stop and graze on the road bank moving.  I think those old cows knew it was time to wean the calves  every fall.\n\nI spent plenty of time in the pens with them.  Never a problem.  We would sort them by nudging them around with somebody working a gate to another pen.  Letting the cows out and keeping the calves back.  At that point you have to be gentle with them or the calves get hurt.\n\nYou have to check your cows daily, and make sure they know you.  I see guys around here who dump them in a pasture and don't check on them for weeks at a time.  Those cows get wild as hell.  They also like the whips, 4-wheelers, and hot shots and typically have cows out, or in the case of my neighbor right now, high death loss.\n\nSo if you have cows that are dangerous, or you are afraid to get in a pen with them, you ain't doing it right.  In my family, it was all about keeping them calm and they'd figure out what you wanted them to do.\n\nAnd that's about all I got to say about that.",

Some of them tolerate me, some of them love me, but the only time I've been nervous with them is when the year-old steers want to play with me like I'm one of them. One friendly little kick or mounting and I'd be down for the count. \n\nOf course shit happens, but if the cattle know and trust the person, and the person knows how to conduct themselves shit is unlikely to happen.

It turns out, that my philosophy towards food is a bit of both of the men in this scene. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K_aHCJbxN0\n\nOn the one hand, I very much enjoy a particular type of thing, on the other hand, it's almost never the one that I'm told is the best. As Huo says in the clip, everybody will be different. They have different preferences and skills and experiences. \n\nThe way you like your milk will be different from the way I like my milk. And most cheeses use skim milk. I don't think it matters as long as it suits your tastes. I can use my professions as an example. I have a farm that specializes in fruit and nuts. The standard way of planting the trees is to take a cutting, dip it in hormone powder, and stick it into some non-soil mix to make it form roots, then it is brought from the nursery to the farm and planted in the ground. I have 2 trees that were done that way. I had one other, but it died. Of the several hundred trees I have, the rest have been grown from seed. I've been told that it is impossible to grow good fruit and nuts this way... But they taste fine to me. I sell them in variety packs. I sort them into fruits for cooking and fruits for fresh eating. They are all unnamed varieties that nobody else has. I bought some cutting type trees recently and that was only because every single last one of the fruit tree farms refused to give me seedlings even if I paid double. So for breeding stock I got a lot of new cuttings and will cross them myself. My orchards and nut groves are going to about double in size in 6 years all from seedlings. I don't think there is a bad kind of apple, only one I haven't tried to eat yet.",

Direct shading should be avoided, and secondary shading known as ambient occlusion will also reduce growth in the direction of nearby trees.  Trees grown in grids are easier to harvest mechanically, but on a homestead one might assume that natural aesthetics played a part in choosing to live in the country.  In nature, you will almost never encounter trees growing in rows.  Grids, squares, and lines will appear man-made.  It is a matter of personal taste as to whether you want your plantings to blend in to the landscape or to stick out.  If you hunt for an ideal spot for each tree individually, the resulting distribution of trees will closely resemble the natural processes that determine where wild trees thrive.",

Each pair (mom and calf) needs approx one acre. Then there's winter silage. If all you have is pasture and nowhere to grow fescue/alfalfa/orchard grass then you'll have to purchase your winter feed.\n\nNot trying to poo-poo your dream... Just giving you a heads up. We grow fescue on 6 of our 22 acres as cattle silage and some years we trade it for a beef since our pastured areas aren't big enough to grow our own cows.\n\nWhile I agrees with another poster about Justin Rhodes' methods, that dude has income from his videos and can afford to buy winter feed. You gotta sell a lot of steers to make that up.",

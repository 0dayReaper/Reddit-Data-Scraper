    "postText": "My dad sadly and suddenly passed away this week and we have live chicken to process. We have a funnel he used to make it easier for him and for the chicken. I remember he used a knife, not an axe. He would leave the neck partially and only removed the head. I watched him do it my whole life but I usually helped my mom take care of the insides. Videos on youtube are not clear if there's a certain angle to cut the head and where exactly to cut. I need concrete advice and soon cuz chicks are ready for processing and it would be best for us to do it over this weekend. Thank you in advance.\n\nEdit: thanks guys, we ended up using an axe cuz I guess you need to be strong enough to get knife trough the neck like butter after all. I messed up the first one and felt rly bad but i guess i know better now for the future. Chicks were also too fat to put them trough the funnel and the whole \"holding them downside and covering their head to calm them\" rly worked. Again, thank all of you, I'll probably ask for more advice in the future (maybe not considering chickens).",

            "comment": "This is the part of processing everyone hates. I hate it but it has to be done. Kill cone is ok. Grab the bird by the feet with one hand. Hold it upside down for a few seconds, it should relax. Slide it down in the cone, keep its feet firmly held while you do, may have to use the other hand to gently guide its head through the bottom of the cone.   Let the bird relax. Use a VERY sharp knife or a new razor knife.  Grab the head between two fingers, firmly and stretch the neck so you get good contact with the knife blade, ( you are committed at this point, do not hesitate or back off, this is the point where you  have control over whether or not the bird suffers) - slice the neck, down towards the base of the head, deep and fast, at least 3/4 the way through, back away a foot or two, try not to let the dying process get to you, the bird can no longer feel at this point. This will stop in a few seconds.   It\u2019s scalder, plucker and dressing out from here.",

                            "comment": "This is an excellent answer. The things I'd add are: \n\n* Covering the bird's face with my hand seems to help it stay calm through the process -- I think because having the face in darkness triggers a \"chill out, it's night time\" reflex\n\n* New razor blade in a box cutter with replaceable blades is my go-to. You want the ones that take single trapezoidal blades, not the ones whose blades you break off as you use them. \n\n* You can feel the pulse in the bird's throat if you palpate right before cutting. That pulse is what you're aiming to sever. \n\n* If your first cut doesn't yield a gush of blood, cut again deep and fast. The bird is dying already and your job is to make it as quick and painless as you can. \n\n* If you hold the head in your hand while slitting the throat, blood may drip down your arm depending on where your arm is. I just roll up my sleeves, but if you're squeamish, you may want to adjust the angle of your arm appropriately. \n\n* It's helpful to have someone hold the bird's feet in the cone. That or secure them with something soft (I put my coat over the top of the cone when I have to process birds solo). During death, the body will spasm, because that's what bodies do. It doesn't mean the bird's alive. \n\n* After the blood is out and the body has done its kicks, I like to immediately remove the head with poultry shears. Then swish the body in a large pot of scalding-hot water that you prepared before starting to butcher, pull the feathers off (body feathers come off in handfulls, whereas wing and tail feathers are best yanked one by one along the direction of the feather shaft), and take the guts out. \n\n* I leave the feet on to hold the carcass with while plucking it, the remove them before or while taking the guts out. Feet are easily removed by cutting the skin and tendons at the knee joint.\n\n* When removing the guts, if you compress the lungs and you cut the neck above the larynx, you may push air through the larynx and the body may make a noise. This does not mean that the bird is alive. This just means that you shoved air though a body part that makes noises when air gets shoved through it. \n\n* In rooster entrails you will find an almost rock-hard, golf-ball-sized lump. This is not an ovary, it's the gizzard. First time I gutted a rooster I found it and had a moment of terror that I'd messed up and killed a hen... You can dissect the gizzard and see that it's almost-solid muscle.\n\n* Depending on your spirituality, you might talk to the animal as you're processing it, perhaps even telling it about people who've passed on that it might meet if it turns out that dead things go somewhere afterwards. It can feel good to thank the animal for doing so well at fulfilling its purpose, and it can feel good to ask it to carry a message to someone if it happens to encounter them.",

After the bird has died some sort of reaction happens with their nerves and it will flop around a good bit: by continuing to hold on to its head for a bit after it passes prevents them from flopping themselves right out of the cone.\n\nAlso, make sure your knife blade is super sharp. I test this by slicing a piece of paper. If it easily cuts the paper, it\u2019s sharp.",

(20 or so birds at a time) The process is about 3 seconds from catching the bird to done and it took practice and there is a method to it. I feel this instant kill is much more humane than drawing it out into a long process. \n\nGenerally you will know if the chicken is healthy. I only eat healthy looking birds that I kill and prep.

I plan to do it again on my bachelor flock of roosters. \n\nWith the broomstick you take a bar (we use rebar) and lay it across the back of the head (just behind the skull).  And in one motion stead on the bar and pull its feet up.   It pops the head off the spine.  The kill is instant.  It will death flap (the spasms) but that means it\u2019s done.  The broomstick got them there quickest.  Quail process similarly but you can just use your hands.  \n\nImmediately after the death flap/spasms are over I remove the head and hang upside down to drain.  This way I feel is fast and clean.\n\nEdit to add - when you do the broomstick method put the bird in a feed bag so they can\u2019t flap.  Cut a corner off the bottom and put the chicken in head first so you can pull it out the corner you cut out.  Tighten the bag so it wraps around hugging the bird to hold its wings down.",

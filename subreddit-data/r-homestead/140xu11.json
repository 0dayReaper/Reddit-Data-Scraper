    "postText": "Asking for input so I can make some tough decisions. I have a ram, who I LOVE. But he seems to be blind at night. He gets around just fine during the day and had no problem settling all of our ewes last fall, but he'll occasionally run into things while we are putting him up for the night (more often if the sun has gone down and there is only residual light left). I'm wondering if this is a big deal. Is this sort of thing highly heritable? Or maybe more likely from an illness he experienced while younger? He is 5 years old, and we got him when he was 4",

Birds are easy to process, I\u2019ve used pocket knives for birds but most I would get for them is a good boning knife and maybe a poultry boning knife if you wanted something smaller for removing breast &amp; tenders if you go that far. \nJust make sure you have a good sharpener to pair with your knife set you\u2019re building &amp; remember butchery is an art so methods vary, what matters is are you happy with what you get.",

Ofc the goats I kill are usually a year and not as mature. If you enjoy deer you\u2019ll enjoy goat, very similar taste. \nI really only cut the pelvis in half &amp; cut the ribs from the loin chops. Everything else I could go through joints with the knife, even removed the pelvis sections through the ball/socket joint from the hind quarters after I had it in two pieces",

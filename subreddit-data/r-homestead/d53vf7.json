The people that grow the 1000 lbs and up have special lifting rings with straps designed specifically for pumpkins and custom made. \n\nBest bet for under 500 lbs is a king size sheet or a large heavy duty tarp. And 6 or so of your best friends who work out a lot. \n\nAnother trick is to place the pumpkin on top of a pallet and a rubber sheet. When it is slightly larger than a basketball/beach ball sized and let it grow on top of the pallet. Then you can run straps through the pallet and pick the whole assembly up and get it out of the garden.",

Just wanted to circle back around 3 weeks later and let you know I actually used your hammock idea to move my pumpkins for judging! Jolene made it onto the scales at a pumpkin festival and weigh-off. I got a hammock on Amazon rated for up to 500 lbs for $17. Hooked the hammock ends to the tractor hay spear and away we went! Thanks for the great idea!",

    "postText": "https://imgur.com/a/N2cQj2z\n\nHi everyone,\n\nMy wife and I got a pair of goats a year ago. They're probably about 60 to 80 pounds.\n\nThe issue is one of them is litteraly water... He escapes through the tiniest of gaps in the fence. He makes it through the holes of out existing 6x12 woven wire fence. The other is a bulldozer, he will brute force his way out of most things by sheer determination and violence.\n\nWere looking into buying an energizer to put up an electric fencing system. Do you know how many joules are required to keep them contained while keeping budget in mind.\n\n\nThanks!!",

I'm commenting so I can come back and read the answers, maybe get a little more secure in my containment too.\n\nMy property is a 45 degree mountain incline and it's a real bear to mow, so the goats do that job for me. But I also take them to the farm which is only a few miles down the road. So we throw em in the Mercedes-Benz station wagon and hustle em on down the road. Stopped for gas once and I heard the lady on the other side of the pump urgently fetching her husband to come look at the \"dogs with horns\".",

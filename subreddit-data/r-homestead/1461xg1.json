You\u2019re putting time, money and effort into something that doesn\u2019t need any of it. \n\nI\u2019m not against using chemicals. I\u2019ll be involved in using chemicals on about 12000 trees this summer. But it\u2019s because it\u2019s either the trees die or they get treated. \n\nFrom your comments, you don\u2019t even understand how to use the chemicals correctly for what you\u2019re up against.\n\nThe reason you have to \u201csoak\u201d the nests? You\u2019re using water based chemicals on a water proof nest. \nYour pest control guy loves you. Gullible, looking for the easy way, and too stubborn to listen to advice contrary to what you\u2019ve established as a best practice. He knows you\u2019re paying him while creating more business for him. \n\nNot sure what you\u2019re doing in this forum if you\u2019re not willing to learn.",

If you want to have any kind of an orchard then you must deal with this very aggressively. Try pyrethroids or cut and burn or a combination or kiss your orchard good bye.",

A more eco approach is allowing wasps to live in places you don\u2019t use (like the upper eaves of your house). The webs serve as wasp defense for the worms, so you can help the wasps out by poking holes in the webs with a stick",

I told them I'd relocate them to my property next time the see em but they don't think it's far enough away to keep their 4-5 week old chicks safe? Am I being naive about how vulnerable chicks of that age and size are? Are they being too cautious about a snake intentionally slithering a quarter mile back to their coop specifically just for a meal? \n\nCuriou about y'alls thought \ud83d\ude02",

If the question is will a non-venomous snake or that size eat baby chicks, the answer is yes. (if it gets the opportunity)",

Main thing is, they aren't particularly aggressive and probably won't risk it with easier food around.  I wouldn't worry about it, we have rat snakes around by the scores and we've never lost a bird to one.  Foxes and shit?  Sure thing.  But not snakes.  \n\nGonna chime in as well that those snakes are extremely beneficial to your local ecosystem, keeping the rats and mice that are attracted to your feed down and deterring the venomous species from hanging around as they do well to drive off copperheads and such and have been known to eat those competitors.  All told, there's no to kill the snakes and very many reasons to leave them be.  I'd go so far as to say that, even if I lost a chick or two to one, and, again, I've never even seen one close to my chicken coops, they'd be worth it for keeping the fucking copperheads away and cleaning out the rats.",

It was the runt of the litter. It didn\u2019t eat it, but it killed her and tried (head was all wet from trying to swallow it). I caught and relocated the snake to my dad\u2019s property. Here\u2019s the size. Seems slightly smaller than that one.",

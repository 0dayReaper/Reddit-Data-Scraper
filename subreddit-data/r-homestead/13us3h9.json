    "postText": "Trying my hand at growing tobacco this year for the first time.  I'd like to utilize some of it for deworming our goats.  It's difficult to find much info on the topic online- It's an old school remedy and tobacco has been bastardized in our society, so naturally most forums just say how DaNgeRouS tobacco is and to stay away from it.  But I'm talking here homegrown, organic tobaccy, not the chemical laden crap you find in your grandma's Virginia Slim 120s.  I'd love to hear if others have experience with this, how you 'dosed' it, if fresh leaves can be given, etc.",

Not tobacco, not pumpkin, not any of that other shit that these backyard YouTubers/Tiktokers claim works.\n\nGoats are incredibly susceptible to worms. Additionally, as prey animals, they are used to hiding their illnesses until they are very, VERY sick. \n\nGet fecals on your goats regularly, and get them on a proper deworming program, with real, modern dewormers. Otherwise there's going to be a good chance that one morning you're going to come out and find your goats down or dead in the barn.",

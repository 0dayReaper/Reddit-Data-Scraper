    "postText": "I'd like to make my own fence rails from the local Eastern red cedar I have available. It's abundant in my part of NJ, and because it spreads rust to apple trees, I have to remove them anyway. In the past, the wood was used for fence rails because the heartwood is rot resistant. But each ten foot section of mortised fence requires one ten foot log split six ways, which takes a lot of time.\n\nIs there a mechanical way to do this? What equipment should I be looking for? What I\"m envisioning is something that looks like a mechanical log splitter with an apple divider shaped blade as the wedge.",

            "comment": "Is the \"split\" look important? Or do you just need them cut down?\n\nIf you just need them sawn into smaller boards you can find a local sawmill or use a bandsaw.\n\nIf you need the \"split\" look you would likely have to do it by hand with wedges and an axe. Most mechanical splitters are only meant for short logs. Like 4 feet at most.",

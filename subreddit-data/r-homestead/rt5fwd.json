After camping in the area since my early 20s, reading the local paper's ads for cabins and acreages and dreaming, I finally found a parcel for sale by owner with a down payment I could make.  In the 4 years, I was able to pay the principal down with extra payments on track to pay off in under 10 years as opposed to 15.   Seeing housing prices at a peak with potential for a long term dip, I sold my house in town for a good amount and paid the loan off.   Now here I stand as FULL OWNER going into 2022!\n\nYou can do it too!   Finding an owner willing to carry with a low down payment IS a viable way to launch your dreams of owning a homestead some day.",

We live in SW FL and I am also from Upstate NY. Moved to Miami day after we were married. Finished college. I was in real estate business my entire career. Struggled a great deal financially as wife wanted to stay home with first child. In any event I was fortunate and did well enough to send kids to college debt free. Here is thing. The only thing we found challenging was our different concept of parenting. I am firm believer that we needed to raise kids to be independent. However, a recent phenomenon has been written about a great deal. Very simply the current question facing many in marriage after the kids move out is this; is the spouse, and is usually Mom at risk of being gender biased going to choose staying with her husband or continue to serve at pleasure of children. Ours are spoiled. Her not working was bad idea after third son entered middle school. I earned good living but traveled internationally extensively. \nSo  fast forward all three still dependent on Mom for Mom and two at 30 and 23 on Dad for money. Son totally blew two years at university and moved home over my strenuous objections. I put a tent and sleeping bag in the driveway. Harsh? Not really. That was over two years go and mom still does his wash, cleans room etc\u2026\nShe does not see long-term damage. \n\nSorry, plan was to buy a house in MN near daughter (Phd) professor, son-in-law atty and two very young grandchildren. So wife is not home much. I was willing to buy small little summer place in country but she want\nS near city. Nope was never plan. So divorce, I have zero desire to see other women and never would. However, economically for her and kids may be better. \nGreat article in Psychology Today dissecting why this is more and more of an issue.  In fact many articles on matter. Mostly it is money and wife never could say no. I take responsibility for not being more budget minded. Very sad for us. Not sure what your particulars are but clearly bond from wife is stronger with eldest daughter than with me. Hurts. But life goes on! Bless you and your family in the new year!",

HEY BABY... Are you deaf?...  Come on, don't be so stuck up!\"  who would you scold for acting rude and antisocially in those cases?\n\nHim stating he's autistic does not change any of this.   This is not his fault, **but it is still his responsibility.**  I grew up aspie myself, and had a rough time in my teens and early 20s, till I WILLED myself to manually learn how neurotypical people \"naturally\" interact smoothly with one another.   All the wishing and whining an scolding that the world was unfair for not understanding my pure intentions was not just wasted but counterproductive.  ONLY by changing my \"natural\" behavior to flow in typical expected ways changed my OUTCOMES with other people positive for all parties.\n\nNow.\n\nI don't want a new map of my property right now, thanks.  Would that be OK with you?  &lt;--- (This is a rhetorical question or thought experiment, NOT a request for anyone's permission.)",

He wasn't trying to sell you anything or get anything from you, just trying to help. Even if you found it less than useful, getting upset isn't a generous response IMO.\n\nFWIW I wondered if you might also be on the spectrum, so that makes a lot of sense, and I'm happy you seem to have figured out how to navigate life. My son is autistic so that is something I think about a lot.\n\nAnyways, I hope you enjoy your new property and I'm happy for you! Whether you have the ridges on a map or not \ud83d\ude02",

At first I was a bit, \"What the heck did I buy?\"  I visited several times over the first months, getting a feel for the land.  Learning the light and win patterns, the sounds, the way water flows when it rains.  Picking my way along faint 4-legged game trails and shoom-shooming through brush getting foxtails in my socks and ticks in my pants.  Through this process, I decided where I wanted the initial roads and parking pads, and where some trails should run.\n\nFast forward several years to now.  I've built a couple of roads and parking areas, and dug a network of trails criss-crossing the hillsides all the way to the 600' bottom.  I've set up camping areas and gotten some income renting to campers through Hipcamp.  This year I hope to improve these sites even further, and start in earnest toward my dream of semi-retiring on the mountain soon.  I may start in a small house in town and have a secure coyote and bobcat proof cattery built up at the ranch so I can spend days at a time living up at the property without leaving my cats alone at the house.  It will be a 2 or so year process once I get the ball rolling on building an actual house on the property, but that is the ultimate plan.  \n\nI've been looking at log cabin kits and have even considered a dome home, which I think would blend in with the rounded hills well.",

The advantage to the seller is, it gets people paying on unusual properties that won't qualify as-is for a bank loan or necessarily attract conventional speculators/developers.  The advantage to the buyer is, it's a way to BUY LAND with little money down and little to NO QUALIFYING.\n\nYou make a down payment to and sign an agreement with the seller.  Many offer different down payment and years of loan in a matrix of lower interest the bigger your down payment and shorter the duration of loan.  \n\nYou want to have a no penalty early payoff clause.  I'm not sure if it's enforceable to charge interest for a period longer than a loan was carried, but wouldn't want to put it to the test in court.",

The next week, I returned to some of the succulents dead and black from freeze damage, and the others eaten to a nubbin by local wildlife.\n\nSo next I figured, \"Junipers thrive here\" and put one in which became dead and stiff before I returned the next weekend and still stands erect as a monument to my local horticultural incompetence.  Then I figured, \"I'll plant some of them in late fall so the root system is established for the arid heat of summer.\"   I put in a couple, which didn't die RIGHT away, but the next weekend after planting, I pulled up to find a pair of scruffy rabbits standing on their hind legs, eating the last remaining greenery atop a fresh bare trunk.  This one hung on for months as I hauled 5 gallon bottles of water to it, but succumbed for good by August that year.\n\nIt's rained a LOT already this season, so hopefully all my trees will bounce back after looking worse and worse during the drought.  I'll have to start now, preparing bulk plant purchases into bigger pots, to be ready for next fall's planting window.\n\nThe trees on the property are mostly oak with a few elderberry, juniper, and a single unexpected pine way down the canyon.   I like this property because the complex topography makes for many microclimates and diversity of flora.  \n\nMost of the trees are the same ones visible on old aerial photos dating back to the early 50s.  Though some new trees have started since then and grown to maturity today, time has shown a steady net loss of trees over time.  A fire in 2003 damaged a lot of the crowns of the old oaks, but many are regenerating from trunk or root level as they do.   It's a challenge for *nature* to establish new trees here, and so far I haven't been able to outperform her, though I will still try.   The guy who recently bought the lot next to mine has some degree in land conservation (only met once so far) and plans to apply this to his property, so I'll follow what he does in establishing trees with keen interest.",

Its elevation is almost the same as a municipal water wellhead 2 miles South near the main river drainage, with the well depth over 300 feet.   The water district wants an active building permit from the County in hand and a $50,000 deposit to even tell me exactly how much it will cost to bring a water meter the last half mile to my property line.  Therefore, I've pondered a well, but determined it wasn't in the cards for my property, even if it could be drilled at the lowest point about 600' lower than the level where the roads and eventual water uses are.  The pine did seem to find a local reliable wet stratum in this mountain, but it's one of the few pines to be seen that's not way up the flanks of the much higher mountains well beyond the ridge I'm on.",

Later they put a 2nd tank in. The thing about that is, if water doesn\u2019t last the summer you can get the tank filled by bulk water supplier (assuming it\u2019s road accessible). That costs, but not as much as you might think. You\u2019d design your buildings to feed into the tank. And collect water off your walpini roof too. I was surprised at how well it works.\n\nThe thing about trees is nature scatters thousands of seeds to get a few to take hold. In your kind of environment planting a few well-grown trees is a high-stakes bet. Collecting seeds and scattering them, or growing a bunch of small trees yourself and planting them with some protection may be a better bet.",

You can't so much as station an RV or shipping container on your own land here without a conditional use permit, and they WILL flex on you sooner or later if you just do it anyway, especially when you try to legally permit as little as a doghouse at some point.\n\nYour county's assessor GIS map has layers you can select for display, to show usage codes and zoning (not quite the same thing, learn about both) visually for the whole area, instead of looking these up lot by lot.  Then look up these usage codes and the relevant zoning code on the county's website.  My property is situated in an \"estate\" zone, which is intended for quiet uses the same as an R-1 residential zone but on properties exceeding 5 or so acres.  The usage code is \"mountain and desert property unlikely to get developed.\"  Because of the E zone, you can legally build your unlikely development here, I already confirmed.",

I may explore options with the friendly connected neighbor.\n\nCost to supply utilities, including off-grid options, is part of the calculus of whether a given property is a good fit for your needs.  Making sure you have deeded access to the property if it doesn't touch a county road is also a potential pitfall.  Beware of land locked properties!",

If I could have taken that 5 figure payoff sum and invested it in a flip property that returns say 50%, then paying the 9% is an acceptable cost in the big picture.\n\nRight now it's most important and attractive to ME to get out from underneath monthly payments.  With this move selling the house and paying off the ranch property, I've gone from having payment obligations of $3000+/mo to under $1000/YEAR for the property tax!",

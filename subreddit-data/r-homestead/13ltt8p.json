    "postText": " **How does** ***Salmonella*** **infect eggs?**  \nBacteria can be on the outside of a shell egg. That's because the egg exits the hen's body through the same passageway as feces is excreted. That's why eggs are required to be washed at the processing plant. All USDA-graded eggs and most large-volume processors follow the washing step with a sanitizing rinse at the processing plant. It is also possible for eggs to become infected by *Salmonella* Enteritidis fecal contamination through the pores of the shells after they're laid. SE also can be inside an uncracked, whole egg. Contamination of eggs may be due to bacteria within the hen's reproductive tract before the shell forms around the yolk and white. SE doesn't make the hen sick. \n\n [Shell Eggs from Farm to Table | Food Safety and Inspection Service (usda.gov)](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/eggs/shell-eggs-farm-table#3) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Eggs are washed to remove any dirt or bacteria that may be present on the eggshell. In the commercial egg industry, eggs are washed and also pasteurized. Pasteurization is the process of rapidly heating eggs to a certain temperature and time to kill bacteria, and is required by the USDA for all commercial egg products sold in the US. [It kills pathogens present at the time of pasteurization, but provides no long-term protection](https://homesteadandchill.com/store-fresh-eggs/) \n\n [eggs washed and pasturized - Search (bing.com)](https://www.bing.com/search?q=eggs+washed+and+pasturized&amp;cvid=45905eaa1cd049f295a9e52dc40c8a73&amp;aqs=edge..69i57j0l8.8415j0j4&amp;FORM=ANAB01&amp;PC=U531&amp;ntref=1)",

            "comment": "Eggs are not allowed to sit anywhere near the chicken after being laid. They roll onto a conveyor belt to the packaging room. Where I put them in trays for transport. My flock gets tested every couple of weeks. Birds have to get it first then after deliver it to the eggs. But before that happens you would notice a surge in mortality. Which makes you test and have the vet check and even dissect a bird for answers. The test takes 3 days to get results. In that amount of time the eggs are still not shipped out to the public. By the way the wash water is only 85 degrees and washing is done in seconds. Eggs never get room temperature. Also wash water is bleach solution 1/4 cup to the gallon.  Not toxic at all. Why eggs have shorter shelf life after washing is because it removes the seal from the egg thus letting the air in. The reason fresh eggs taste better and have better looking yolks is because the store eggs are more than 3 weeks old by the time they get to the store.\n\nBy the way I raise organic free range eggs",

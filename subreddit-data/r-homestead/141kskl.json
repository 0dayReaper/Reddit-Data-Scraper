    "postText": "EDIT: My post seems to have been unclear. I am asking about two separate but parallel fences. The point of a double fence is that the deer is unsure of their landing; a 4 foot fence by itself is a joke but if there are two fences and they're close enough together the deer won't risk a jump since they don't want to crack their jaw or break a foot on the other side. They can jump insanely high from a standstill but they still need a clear landing zone. Make their landing zone unsafe with another obstacle &amp; they'll go eat the neighbor's garden first rather than risk jumping.  \n\n\nI am working some things out on paper regarding my garden since the deer seem bound and determined to always destroy my grapes and strawberries despite having 3+ acres of excellent browse and fruit to choose from including an entire scuppernong arbor. I really need to suck it up &amp; take my hunter safety course &amp; learn to use a bow.\n\nANYWAY. I'm considering moving some of the productive gardening close to the house &amp; fencing it off with two 4' fences about 5' apart.\n\n1. Will I need to build two gates (one in each fenceline) in order to maintain the barrier? Surely the answer is \"yes\" but I'm crossing my Ts and dotting my Is here.\n2. Does it matter what the two fences are made of? Would it be reasonable to have a welded wire fence and then a 4 or 5 strand high tensile wire fence for the other? Or should they \"match\"?\n3. does anyone have advice for installing a double fence against deer in hilly or mountainous terrain? The area I'm looking to use drops off steeply at the back towards our pond &amp; it most closely resembles Appalachian foothills or mountains in terms of steepness, tree root density, &amp; rocks.",

            "comment": "So, the reason double fencing (and single-fencing sufficiently small areas) works is that the deer can't see a good spot to land on the other side of the fence. \n\nDepending on the situation you're in, you might find it more effective to use a single opaque fence. Test this out by hanging tarps or similar on an existing fence that the deer previously had a habit of hopping over, to make sure it works on your deer. But generally, they only like jumping over barriers if they can see where they're planning to land on the other side. \n\nOpaque fencing may not work depending on whether it'd block sunlight to your garden, but it's worth considering because depending on implementation it could be a lot cheaper than 2 regular fences. \n\nIMO a 4'x5' barrier on its own is unlikely to stop deer. If you go for double fencing, you'll probably need to use taller posts and strands of wire between them above the fence. Putting 4' of welded fence with 4-5 strands of tensile wire above it to make an 8-9 foot high barrier seems much more promising than using the same materials for 2 lower fences.",

I have a fully remote job and my company is willing to sign a letter stating that I am approved to work from whichever location I choose. I want to make sure that I plan appropriately so I can navigate any potential pitfalls when obtaining a mortgage. Thank you in advance for your help.",

They just verified the income I was claiming and how long I've been employed there and that was that.\n\nStarlink works really well for us. One trick though, if it shows waitlisted for your area, do a \"Mobile\" plan and then switch to the regular plan when it becomes officially available there.",

It sounds like your employment is secure. The lenders like to see two years full time in your career and it\u2019s good to play the build your credit game in the meantime.",

Happy with where I ended up buying, land was cheap relative to most of the country, taxes are low (tax appraisals are low), laws are homestead and small farm friendly, and I love winter and being an hour inland from the coast. Better air quality than the south too. My dog and I don\u2019t like hot weather. Yet still the south you get much better growing seasons and the mountains are full of huge hardwood forests which are a joy to be in. Good luck with your search!",

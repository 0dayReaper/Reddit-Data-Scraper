    "postText": "Any advice is appreciated \n\nI was going through the manual, and it says to make sure the greenhouse is on flat ground which makes sense. I plan on building a sturdy wood frame using 4x6s for the greenhouse to be anchored to. \n\nSince the wood frame itself will be flat, do I need to go through the trouble of making sure the dirt that I will be putting the wood frame on top of us perfectly flat and level as well? Or will just making sure that the wood foundation is flat and not warped be good enough? \n\nAlso, the wife thinks I need to drill through my 4x6s and drive stakes into the ground, which seems overkill.we are not in a high wind area, and four (nearly) full length pressure treated 4x6s will be enough weight that it ain't going anywhere. Or am I wrong?",

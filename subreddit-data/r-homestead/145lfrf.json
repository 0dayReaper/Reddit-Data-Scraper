(thats with plum curculio; but coddling and oriental fruit moth are a little different). Mostly, the scars from the actual adult feeding is just cosmetic damage (provided its not so excessive ants get into it). \n\nfoliar sprays of molasses, fish, Iron acetate, calcium acetate, Epsom salt, veggie oil, and yogurt are often enough to keep the pest problem to merely a cosmetic issue. best applied before roughly 8am or after 8pm (when the tree's able to absorb the nutrients before it dries in the sun). If you have a cheese mfg near you, you can often get whey to make up the bulk of your spray water, while also adding some protein, carbs, and calcium. (because it contains organic matter, mfgs can't just dump whey in most situations, so it costs them money to dispose of it)",

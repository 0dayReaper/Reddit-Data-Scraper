Especially, if people growing their own food preserves heirloom varieties, is more environmentally friendly, promotes self-reliance and resilience, and helps maintain knowledge around how to grow food.\n\nThat being said, I have spent so much time and money trying to successfully grow my own crops in an inhospitable environment, that buying some bland corporate farmed tomatoes feels like a luxury.",

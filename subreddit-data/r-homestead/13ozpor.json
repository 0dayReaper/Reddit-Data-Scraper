    "postText": "I recently bought this old uncompleted summer home for about $4000 that has been abandoned since the early 1990s. There is another room which is an added on wooden structure that needs renovation and once I complete that section I\u2019ll move the donkey there. I\u2019m also going to be getting mangalitsa pigs very soon once I finish building their shelter. The small plot of land is filled with Apple, cherry, pear trees, grapes, blackberries, and much more so they will have plenty of snacks while roaming around this summer.",

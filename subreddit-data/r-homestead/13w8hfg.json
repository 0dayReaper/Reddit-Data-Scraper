    "postText": "Alright guys, I\u2019m looking for suggestions here. We have five acres of land, run on a private well (not totally sure on depth of the well so can\u2019t answer that question) and have a running stream/creek that runs along the back border of our property. Fire season is gonna come and we want to make sure we adequately water our land. We aren\u2019t sure about ways to pump from the creek yet and it apparently gets low during the summer after the snow pack is done melting away. Any and all suggestions are welcome! Any particular types of hoses, sprinklers or best practices for watering land is much appreciated thank you!",

I've never actually built one of these ram pumps, but I know someone who has and they apparently work pretty good.\n\nEffectively, low amounts of steady pressure over time can pump your water uphill without power. Pretty handy.",

            "comment": "I know this is a serious question and real fear for many.\n\nHowever, I question if you're going about this the right way and properly.\n\nFirstly, what are your water rights, if any? This varies greatly from location to location.\n\nIs watering or water storage the proper way to combat Wildlands fire? If you have a fire hydrant, perhaps... But my experiences are with fire lines and vegetation management. What steps have you done there?\n\nEven if a private well, do you share with others? Again, water rights come into play, along with recharging the water table systems or aquafer.\n\nJust keeping it green will not stop a Wildlands fire. It may smoke more and smolder longer, but once things get moving and going, there are many factors (wind, vegetation type, terrain, direction, path) that ultimately determine fate.\n\nBest of luck in your land and water management.",

I was told to talk to our nearest fire department and a guy would come out for free to help us best discuss fire season etc. where we live it\u2019s common for people to just keep the surrounding area of the house well watered and green and leave the rest up to date, though keeping it cut short is also best. Currently looking into water rights as well!",

            "comment": "Why do you think that watering the land is the best way to reduce fire risk? \n\nOngoing watering causes more plants to grow. Plants are flammable. \n\nYour #1 best way to protect your house from wildfire is defensible space around the house. To maintain defensible space, you want to minimize the amount of flammable stuff immediately around the home, and minimize the amount of tall/large flammable stuff further out around the home. \n\nLook up ember storm tests on youtube for ideas about improving the fire resistance of any vents in your home and your gutters, too. \n\nTo pump from the creek, you're gonna need a hole with enough water to cover the drafting foot of the pump you're using. You'll need a rigid drafting line to go from the creek to the pump you're using, and whatever kind of hose to go from the pump to wherever you're pumping the water. You want to set the pump as close to the water level of the creek as you can, because the higher it's trying to lift the water, the slower it'll push water through. Look up the gas and diesel powered pumps used in wildland firefighting to get an idea of what you might want to use if you're actively fighting fire from the creek. \n\nBetter than counting on the creek would be storing rain off your roof, though. You can put lots of couple-thousand-gallon plastic tanks on your site, ideally uphill from your house so you can gravity feed water to them if the power is out. Protect the plastic tanks from fire, as they can melt. The benefit of a lot of smaller tanks is that if one fails or gets accidentally emptied, the others are probably fine. \n\nLook up NFPA rated steel tanks for the ultimate in firefighting water storage, though. Steel tanks are much more fire-resistant than plastic -- I personally trust Australian resources on tank selection in general because they get so many bush fires that you can find post-fire retrospectives on how various tank types performed. The actual NFPA stuff on a steel tank helps pro firefighters get the water out faster, and adds thousands of dollars in cost, but can often be retrofitted later. The drawback to a single huge tank is that if you leave the valve open or get a leak, you can lose all your water.",

So any input is appreciated! Also thank you for the tips!",

    "postText": " \n\nIn 2019, about 60% of sewage sludge produced by treatment facilities will be spread on farmland and gardens, as well as schoolyards and lawns. Sludge holds nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients that help crops grow, so the waste management industry lightly treats it and sells it cheaply to farmers who view it as a cost-saving product.\n\nBut in fact the excrement from which sludge derives has mixed with any number of 80,000 manmade chemicals that are discharged from industry\u2019s pipes or otherwise pumped into the sewer system.\n\n [Biosolids: mix human waste with toxic chemicals, then spread on crops | Pollution | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/05/biosolids-toxic-chemicals-pollution)",

Land treated with this often can not be used for farming because the pollutants are picked up by crops and livestock making them toxic for consumption.  This has put many farms, large and small, out of business.  \n\nParts of small farms are often sold off to homesteaders who do not know that the land they are buying was treated with sewage sludge in the past.  The unsuspecting homesteader is then investing time and money into a property where he intends to raise food for himself and his family, but that food will be toxic.\n\nSo if you are purchasing a piece of land for a homestead you should find out about its history as far as being treated with sewage sludge.\n\nTen or so years ago I was in Pennsylvania seeing a guy who lived on 10 acres where he and his wife had horses, a milch cow, and an acre garden.  He was surrounded by huge Amish farms with dairies which were beautiful, but the stench!  He said the odor was bad, but nowhere near as bad as the few weeks after they spread sewage sludge.  Back then I don't think they realized there were any problems with using sewage sludge as fertilizer, and I think the EPA still allows it.  But I sure wouldn't want to eat from his garden or drink his cow's milk since the land was probably treated with sewage sludge before he built his homestead.",

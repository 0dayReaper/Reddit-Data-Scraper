Not long after she created her egg case last fall, she disappeared (I assume died) they only live for a year here. \n\nI have a large organic garden in the woods [(pic)](https://imgur.com/a/BczMIku) so I try to work with (vs. fight) the surrounding nature as much as possible, I let the bugs be bugs and just keep an eye on everything. I also have honey bees, if the mantis population were to get too large and start to negatively affect my bees and overall plant pollination I'd step in, but they have not been a problem yet in the last 5 years since I created the garden, I typically only see a couple each year.",

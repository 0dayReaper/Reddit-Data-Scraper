Unfortunately, to burst your bubble, anything Miracle-Gro is the absolute worst you can get, in terms of quality, long-term soil (above and below) health, and chemicals. I am not well versed on the details but I know enough to know it should never be touched and will cause issues down the road. And if you wanted to be organic, MG kills that entirely. Sorry. Get a brand like Fox Farm, farm more natural, has higher quality products, and naturally feeds your food more efficiently for longer. And it's better for your ground soil health.",

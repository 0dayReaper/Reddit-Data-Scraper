    "postText": "I am considering parking a small Scamp trailer in a butler building type pole barn. Out of all the alternative living scenarios I\u2019ve brainstormed this one seems like the most doable, and least likely to kill me. \n\nMy main concern is Co2 type gases produced from the camper and trapped in the barn. \nAlso heating, it gets down to -40 F at times, so would a smaller wood stove outside the camper be helpful to warm the insulated barn\u2026 or wasteful. \n\nAdvice, pictures, or any ideas welcomed!",

            "comment": "Many years ago I lived in a camper inside a pole barn.  We had a wood stove in the entryway space (outside the camper but inside the wooden walls, with all appropriate cladding and height to the stovepipe), and we just left all the windows and doors open to let the heat in.  We vented the gas stovetop directly out through the barn wall.  Kept the snow load from sitting on the roof, eliminated leaks, allowed us to safely heat with wood and made a space to store some wood under cover.  We did have mice issues, but other than that it worked pretty well.  The barn was still useable after we removed the camper, too- we used it for a sheep shelter for a few years.",

                            "comment": "It was really just a roof and walls, with around/less than 10 feet of clearance along the door side of the camper (where we stacked wood, hung wet/snowy outerwear and had the wood stove) and only a few inches of clearance on the other sides.  It did make the camper very dark, because we didn't add any windows to the barn structure.  We lined the wall behind the stove with sheet metal, but any appropriate cladding would be good- you want the stove heat to be reflected back toward the camper space.  Honestly it got way warmer than I like a lot of the time, because the heated space is pretty small.  \n\nOur mice issue was mostly because of the small headspace above the roof of the camper- we stuffed it with some spare insulation and it was mouse heaven.  But we didn't have any indoor dogs or cats, which might have been enough deterrent.  We just kept mouse traps on frequent rotation.\n\nI see a lot of campers with stovepipes run out a side window, but that's a major fire hazard, and an asphyxiation risk.  Adding a very basic exterior wall/roof allows you to have the heat with a traditional stovepipe and extra venting (via the door to the exterior and any windows you include). Just be certain to also add vents all the way to outside for the cooktop!",

            "comment": "Some of my neighbors have done that, roofing over RVs and single wide mobile homes. \n\nA full barn around the trailer will reduce wind chill, which is helpful. \n\nAny combustion will need a chimney or vent to the outdoors. It'd probably make more sense to install a wood stove in the barn than in the camper, for long-term use and simplicity of installation. You could rig a setup to heat water on the stove and run it through pipes in or around the camper for active heating if necessary -- just make sure any vessel of water in such a system can gracefully handle boiling over. \n\nConsider what you'll do about mice. There will be mice. Cats and drown traps are both options. \n\nConsider daylight into the RV. Try to line up its windows with a window in the barn if you can.",

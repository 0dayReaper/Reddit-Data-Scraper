That puts us at around 6,072,000 dead with proper healthcare but no prevention/mitigation plan in place. Without adequate healthcare that number spikes to nearly 9% or 23,760,000 dead in the US.\n\nAt the current numbers we're doubling infection every 2.6 days right now. Most of these cases are from people that were infected days or weeks ago. For example the healthy 30 year old in Minnesota who was refused testing originally when he had symptoms back on the 25th and is now in critical condition.\n\nAnyone saying this virus is not dangerous is full of it,\n\nThree simple things could go a very long way to helping to prevent this from erupting into total chaos.\n\n1: why is the CDC not prepared and sending out masks to every man, woman and child? It worked extremely well in china. I'm not talking N95 masks either, just masks to \"help\" prevent sick people from spreading it. In china its mandatory to wear a mask in public right now. This would go a long way, and enacting a temp measure that does this for everyone is not hurting any freedoms.\n\n2: mandatory quarantine of anyone going on a cruise ship or coming back from a country not managing it properly.\n\n3: Close the schools, do online schooling or postpone school until this is under control. What is the difference if the kids get a break now and go for two-three extra weeks later?\n\nIf we take no action the double infection every 2.6 days will also escalate as the hospitals fill and are unable to quarantine people.\n\ncurrent \"tested\" number in the US is \\~1,000 with that number being about 1-2 weeks behind actual infected due to non testing and those with undeveloped symptoms the actual number today is likely \\~35,000 infected.\n\nIn two more weeks actual infected would be 1.2 million. Do the math.",

A significant portion of nurses and doctors have children in school, but we need them at hospitals. Many other working parents can't afford to take time off work. Plus, children do not appear to be getting sick from this virus, so isolating them may be more trouble than it's worth (even if they are carriers).",

People blow this off by saying that it isn a big deal for x population. They saw thins while blowing off the fact that more people infected from X population will make it more likely that people in Y population will be exposed. People in the Y population are old and/or immunocompromised. That makes the virus a huge deal for them. We need to concentrate on having the lowest possible number of people infected so that they can transmit the virus to the lowest number of people. We need to stop only considering the immediate consequences and start looking down the road a little bit.",

People who contract the virus are looking at two weeks in quarantine. The burden on our medical systems is extreme. The costs of medical care are high. There are massive economic impacts from people not flying, any events that have a lot of people congregating being cancelled, people not being able to travel for work, parts and materials from affected areas being delayed, parents having to stay home with kids because schools are cancelled, etc. \n\nThis is a huge deal. Panic doesn\u2019t do us any good, but this is going to have a major impact on most of our lives.

They can't test people appropriately or carry our joined up pubic health control due to this. People are not getting tested due to the extra costs- At the moment there are likely hundreds of thousands of people in the US in denial walking around infecting others. In about three weeks    you are looking at total carnage. 120 million infected people, 18-19 million people needing hospital, up to 4.8 million needing ventilation, 1.2 million deaths.

This, pretty specifically, is what I envision ours to be when we eventually buy. \n\nWhat's in the green house? \n\nWhat do you grow? \n\nHow did you learn what to grow and when? \n\nHow would that support you for a year, out of curiosity?",

Eventually everything became straight and all areas in the garden require being managed so you aren\u2019t spreading weed seeds.  My greenhouse is 35\u2019x96\u2019. It gets cheaper per square foot as it gets bigger so I got as big as I could afford.  Put it in full sun so algae doesn\u2019t grow in it in the winter.  At least 3/4 of the space goes towards growing food for the off season... potatoes, dry beans, flour corn, winter squash, onions and garlic.  Then in the summer/fall we plant a ton of brassicas and root verges that can be harvested from the ground all winter.  \n\nThe greenhouse has tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, cucumbers, melons and basil in the summer and is full of lettuce and brassicas during the winter.  \n\nOnce my garden became more established I was able to attract some people to come help that knew a lot about gardening.  It\u2019s invaluable to spend some time with people in your area who are growing food even if it means working someone else\u2019s farm.  I highly recommend volunteering.  YouTube has a lot of great info as well but there are always so many small things that only local farmers know.\n\nProper storage is essential and also working out meal plans.  A root cellar or dark cold room is good.. every crop has slightly different ideal conditions which takes a lot of trial and error.",

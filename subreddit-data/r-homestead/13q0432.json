    "postText": "Hey guys, well I'm looking to refine my hide tanning skills. Many years ago I tanned various hides but wasn't super concerned with the quality of my work. Basically I fleshed them salted stretched and worked them.resulting in a product that was finished but a little stiff and rugged. I would really like to refine this skill.ive been reading up on egg tanning.i currently have 1 sheep skin fleshed, well salted and, folded up. The internet has a lot of conflicting advice.what has worked best for you guys? What would you recommend I do from this point on to create a softer more refined piece? \nThank you kindly for your responses",

We have such high heat that the soil dries pretty darn fast, but we water diligently. \n\nIs it possible that our heat is causing too rapid of changes in the soil moisture? \n\nOur heirloom tomato plant does not have this problem and they are directly next to each other.",

On the overwatering end - does your soil drain well? Are you in ground or raised beds? Do you amend your soil with compost and organic matter to keep it healthy?",

It is on a large ceramic pot. \n\nIt is potted so not a bed or in ground. \n\nWe will look into amending our soil with compost. The soil we use had compost in it, and we tried to add bone meal and occasionally but the dogs would end up eating it and the soil so we stopped doing that. \n\nWe do feed it banana water occasionally if that counts.",

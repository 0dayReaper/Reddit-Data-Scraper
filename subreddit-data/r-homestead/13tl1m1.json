But the bags break down in the sun and then you have small particles of plastic all over your garden.  \nThe only thing we use them for now is as trash bags. I wish the feed we use came in paper bags.",

            "comment": "Some people make and sell reusable shopping bags from them. Pretty straightforward if you have a sewing machine. If yours fray like tarps, cut them with a hot knife or soldering iron instead of scissors. You can make pretty cute bags if you use the happy animal pictures printed on the feed sacks to your advantage. \n\nI also cut them open and use them as mini tarps for projects that would otherwise mess up my porch, like spray painting stuff. \n\nI personally fold my used bags flat and keep them in case I ever need/want sandbags. They don't take up too much room, and when you need sandbags you really need temporary sandbags. \n\nLately when building sheds, I've happened to have scraps of the appropriate house wrap type textiles around when I needed them. But if I didn't have those and wanted an extra moisture barrier under siding or something on a building that I didn't care too much about, I'd consider stapling up opened feed sacks in a shingled pattern. \n\nSeconding what /u/newsalt2005 said about them breaking down with excess UV, though. I wouldn't use them for any permanent application exposed to the elements.",

This is because one of the major effects of scurvy is that the body can no longer produce collagen, the glue of the body's cells. The cartilage, especially around the thorax, begins to disappear. **That's why people who had scurvy creaked and rattled\u201d**\n\nFucking terrifying \ud83d\ude33",

We found a previously unknown human *organ* in the span of the last decade..  No joke; it's called [interstitium](https://www.science.org/content/article/scientists-say-they-ve-found-new-human-organ) and it may be vital to our understanding of how some cancers metastasize).It's fucking crazy how much we don't know and simply astounding how often we find the scope of what we know we don't know growing..  I think it would boggle the mind to actually fathom the sheer scope even, of how much we don't even know we don't know..\n\nAll this to say, we've just recently gotten over the first hurdle of acquiring and developing the foundation of knowledge and tooling needed to start to design experiments that promise to be revelatory, and above all, *doable*.  Now we start to *really* learn new things...  The gen-z is in for a whole new type of roller coaster that I can only hope to witness myself...\n\nYou know, if we don't vote, choke, poke, bomb, and generally engage in short-sighted self-destruction until we've knocked ourselves out of the running before we get to have some *real* fun...\n[Tbc, no issue with voting, but many of our elected governments around the world atm appear to be locked in wasteful and destructive infighting along party lines and sorry sighted corruption where I think we're better served electing officials that actually have an understanding of science, tech, economy, and human nature and take advice from experts rather than money from players.  WHO we elect is important and unfortunately we aren't voting in people that I feel are contributing to our self-immolation rather than to our growth as a species]",

Endorheic lakes are lakes without outlets and tend to become saline in hot and warm climates due to evaporation and the salts in the water unable to leave the lake. But Lake Texcoco had enough water sources entering the part of the lake near the islet the city was founded on that the Aztecs built a dam across the lake to create an area that would become fresh water and let the rest remain brackish. This solved the issue of providing enough freshwater for drinking as well and of course allowing them to farm using the chinampa system. People often wrongly think the chinampas float, but they were made with posts driven into the lake bed in a rectangular shape (about 100 by 10 feet) with lakebed sediment and dead vegetation layered to create soil high enough that it sat several feet above the water. Water loving willows were planted along the borders to keep them from eroding since the original wood posts would rot out over time.   \n\n\nThe city itself was built in a similar way to the chinampas, it's all reclaimed land built up by piling lake sediments into walled off areas and then building on top of that. Because a city built close to lake level would be in danger of flooding, the Aztecs also had a series of control dams that would manage water, allowing them to release excess water into the brackish part of Lake Texcoco. One ruler attempted to build an aqueduct to bring water in from the mainland, but that failed and apparently caused a flood.",

Fish can be harvested from it. No fish food is required to feed the fish because they can eat insects, wild plants, and other fish (depending on the type of fish). Wild animals can use it for habitat, as can domesticated water fowl like geese and ducks. And, once in place, it requires very little interference from humans.\n\nWow, is that sounding familiar? Kind of like a Chiampa, yeah?\n\n\\&gt;I also don't think you know what pedantic means but you can look that one up yourself.\n\nYeah let's have some fun and do that:\n\n\\&gt;Pedantic is an insulting word used to describe someone who annoys others by correcting small errors, caring too much about minor details, or emphasizing their own expertise especially in some narrow or boring subject matter.\n\nSo, you're being pedantic because you're trying to be hyper-specific about defining something, even to the point where you're NOT EVEN CONSIDERING THAT YOUR OWN DEFINITION WAS INCLUDED IN MINE.\n\nIt's literally not even worth mentioning--to me at least--that Chiampas would have been used to raise fish AS WELL: [https://www.permaculturenews.org/2020/02/08/chinampas-how-to-put-them-in-small-scale-designs/](https://www.permaculturenews.org/2020/02/08/chinampas-how-to-put-them-in-small-scale-designs/)\n\n\\&gt;The canals separating the strips of land are stocked with fish and shellfish supplying much more animal protein per square meter than land-based animal systems. Productive vines can be grown on trellises over the canals to further the potential.\n\nThey were on a god damned lake. It's not really worth mentioning that \"pure aquaculture\" would have obviously been part of the system. But no, here you are with your pedantic, violent agreement as is typical of Reddit.\n\nSo yeah you were actually correct in your first statement--Chiampas were not the 'typical' idea of aquaculture. Your mistake was assuming I was using the 'typical' definition of aquaculture at all which I've always found too narrow.",

Now that water is mostly bought rather than freely used the concept becomes too expensive as there are of course vastly superior amount of water running than what you would use by watering, and now we come full circle to the concepts of aquaculture with a loop of water rather than a natural stream.",

Hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of people, died thanks to small pox and measles being spread via trade routes. The native population had 0 immunity to these diseases since they had very few livestock animals that carried such diseases (these diseases were mutated variants that infected cows and pigs, which the New Wold did not have). \n\nThe natives of North America were, more or less, living in a post-apocalypse when the Europeans showed up. If the natives did have immunity, instead of a handful of scattered tribes that numbered a couple thousand per tribe at most, the Europeans would have walked into societies of hundreds of thousands. The colonization would have looked vastly different.",

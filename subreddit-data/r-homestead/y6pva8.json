They ask for some anti-snake venom and he says oh I wouldn't bother, none of these would work. And besides, there's no hospitals on Komodo, you'd never make it out on time. \n\n\"So... what do we do if we get bitten!?\" They ask.\n\n\"Oh... Well, you die, of course.\"",

                    "comment": "It\u2019s so baffling too. I\u2019m from a family of herbalists, from indigenous descent and people who married in/lived among them. What did folks do? They went into modern medicine. A lot of it is similar, as most drugs are from plants/fungi. It\u2019s just better since it\u2019s regulated and chemically pure. \n\nMeanwhile growing amaranth was outlawed and barely persevering until the 1970s, but now everyone and their mom claims to be into \u201cnatural medicine\u201d when they disliked or still dislike the people whose ancestral knowledge they\u2019re warping. It\u2019s so weird. Now folks are poaching white sage. It\u2019s a facepalm. \n\nObviously folks are welcome to learn about herbalism or buy from ethical salespeople, but oh nooo. Modern Medicine is A+. What remains of North American herbalism is mostly \u201ceat your greens\u201d, spiritual practice, and spiritual practice with active ingredients (cannabis, peyote, etc). Sure, sure, you can buy willow bark tea, but why not aspirin? It\u2019s so much simpler. If you want to make your own, homesteading, I guess it can be done, but that would require a knowledge of organic chemistry. Unless you\u2019re in the apocalypse, people look at you funny if you have a full mad scientist lab in your garage (sadly). \n\nSide note: Homeopathy is a scam worse than snake oil. At least snake oil is useful.",

I was always taught not to bother going to the ER because they'll just send you home after minimal treatment, and that is exactly what happened to a few people I knew. Because copperhead bites aren't deadly unless you're a baby, very old, or immunocompromised. lol A high school friend was bitten, went to the ER, they cleaned the wound, and sent him home with the suggestion that he manage the pain with OTC NSAIDs. If you aren't having symptoms related to envenomation, they won't do much other than clean your wound and *maybe* observe you.\n\nIt also isn't that unusual in rural areas around here for people's dogs to be bitten by copperheads. Even in dogs -- much smaller than humans, obviously -- serious symptoms are very rare, and it usually doesn't merit a vet visit. Just close observation and comfort.\n\nPeople act like copperheads are as bad as king cobras or boomslangs or whatever, and that just isn't true. Misinformation about snakes leads to fear, and fear gets wildlife killed needlessly.",

(Not the singing, though.) Lying still in a dark place is not the worst idea in the world.\n\nSnake venom accesses the body via the lymphatic system. So if you get bitten, the last thing you want to do is move around and pump it through your body. Indigenous Australian treatment of snakebite is to lie still in the shade for three days and drink only water, don't eat. Remain calm. Sleep as much as you can. \n\nThis allows your body to treat the toxin and keep it contained to as small an amount of tissue as possible.\n\nOf course, some snakes are venemous enough that you cannot survive without a prompt treatment of antivenin, but as I said, if you are remote enough that you cannot access medical assistance, rest, quiet, and fasting give you your best bet of survival.",

If bitten by a venomous snake, immobilise the limb and bandage with a compression bandage (not tourniquet) starting above the bite and working upwards. This is the most important thing for improving your chances. Other than that, per above. This increases your time for treatment from as little as 30 minutes out to (up to)  a day. Even when you get treatment, do not remove the bandage, even if the medica profs l try. Unless they are experienced in snake bites, even medical professionals often make this mistake.\n\nEdit: bike=&gt;bite. Damned swype",

First is it can only be maintained for a short time before the limb will be permanently damaged due to lack of blood flow. Second is when it is released it will result in delivery of contaminated blood at high pressure into the circulation system resulting in catastrophic failure. A reduced flow of toxins (as in compression bandage) can actually be managed by the circulatory system. Generally it isn't the toxin itself that is the problem, it is its concentration. Slowing it down allows the body to deal with smaller amounts before it destroys critical organs. Sometimes if the delivery is small and a compression bandage slows it down, an anti venom will not even be required as these too have risks such as anaphylactic shock. A small concentration can sometimes be managed by the body, which is why the indigenous Australians approach would have been successful for some bites.",

For the neurotoxic kind of venom y\u2019all have in Australia, which I am honestly not too familiar with, that may work. \n\nBut for American pit vipers, ie rattlesnakes and copperheads, they have venom that dissolves tissue, so you want it to dilute in your blood. Laying down is a good idea but there\u2019s no such thing as keeping the toxin to a small part of the body and hoping the body digests it before it digests the body. For pit vipers, people can have delayed reactions of up to several days, where they seem to be doing okay and then some metabolic scale tips over and suddenly they\u2019re super, super sick. \n\nTl;dr pls go to the hospital if you\u2019re bitten by a snake",

                    "comment": "When I did my first aid course (in Aus), someone asked what to do if you don't have a pressure bandage or anyone to help for a snake bite - i.e, you're out on a trail. The answer is, yes, lie down, don't move, wait for help.\n\nAll dangerous Australian snakes are neurotoxic and the venom transports from lymph to blood by motion of muscles. If you don't move, the lymph doesn't move, and you have a good chance. If you panic and run around you can be dead in an hour. If you can get to a hospital they can give you antivenin that works for all Australian snake bites, and then if you have an allergic reaction to that they can give you adrenaline.\n\nThe relevant story from the trainer was a mountain biker, got bit out on a trail solo, no first aid kit, no phone reception. Got off his bike, lay on the side of the trail for four hours until someone came by, sent them for help, got transported out and survived.\n\nAnd yes, it is more likely you will survive by staying still, even if you cannot access antivenin. Your body might cope with a bit of venom creeping in, but not the big dose you'll get if you metabolise it by rushing about.",

Australia has the advantage of all our venomous snakes being deadly in the same way, so treatment is uniform in all cases, so we have very few deaths from snake bite. In most other countries, treatment is more variable, and there is not a polyvalent antivenin for all snake bites as there is for most of Australia.",

Their venom is in general neurotoxic and spreads through the lymphatic system, so the best field treatment is a compression bandage and rest. \n\nIf you are in the US and have been bit by a venomous snake, the odds are you have been bitten by a Crotalid (pit viper), a subfamily of Viperidae. Copperheads are crotalids. Their venom is generally hemotoxic and spreads through the blood. You DO NOT want a compression bandage on a crotalid bite, as it is more likely to cause cell damage and limb loss. Rinse off the bite site and allow it to bleed or lightly bandage it, try to stay calm as you seek help. \n \nThe Mojave Rattlesnake is a special case crotalid, as it has both hemotoxic and neurotoxic venom, so you need a special antivenin for treatment.  \n\nThe other venomous snakes are other subfamilies of Viperidae, which live across Eurasia and Africa. Good luck with those bites.",

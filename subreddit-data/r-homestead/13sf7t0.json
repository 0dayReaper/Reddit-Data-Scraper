            "comment": "Length of the wire run is more important fact here.  The longer the distance the bigger the wire needs to be to get the same amps to the outlet/light.  If it is over 50' I would go rent a walk behind trencher.\n\nYou mentioned 600 feet run.  You would need 1 or 2 gauge wire if you have 20 or 15 amps of power running.  That is a really long run and some thick wire.  Might be better to get another meter from the power company.\n\nI think this is outside the do it yourself scope.  Get a contractor opinion.",

Maybe even pull / suck string thru the grey conduit.  You can terminate them under ground at the ends of the runs, or take the conduit inside the barn.  Someday you may want water, or the water supply you have now may get compromised, and you may want ethernet cable out to the barn so you can add a router for WiFi, cameras, alarm, etc..  you can thank me later \ud83d\ude0e",

I would get 20 foot long bell end pvc 1\" you can plug them all together. Get a tube of wire pull and use it to pull your wire through\n\nEdit: no need for conduit if you use direct burial wire, that's a better option",

Minimum payments will add up to roughly 150k in interest alone over 30 years.\n\nEven adding just an extra $250 per month makes a significant difference.  You\u2019ll pay off your loan 5 years earlier, and save over $25k in interest.  Not to mention you\u2019ll be building equity faster in case you need to refinance or take out a HELOC.",

Purchased last year (but refi\u2019d in August at a much lower interest rate) and put 20% down at closing. \n\nNo longer have a 401k/Roth through my job. Have left two Roth accounts untouched (didn\u2019t roll them) from my previous two positions.  Have been using Goldman and aggressive investments as my primary retirement vehicle at this point.  I\u2019ve been getting between 5-8% depending on the year from that. I have 12 months of cash, so I feel fine on that front. \n\nWe have had a lot of major expenditures lately (renovating home, wedding, health issues, dog surgeries) that the thought of putting the \u201cextra\u201d towards the home feels scary. Mainly because I\u2019ve never dipped into my 12 mo emergency savings and doing so almost feels like failure (I don\u2019t know how to explain it).  I really only want to touch that in the event we can\u2019t afford food or basic necessities because of so many shitty unforeseen events, as I feel I can strongly cut a lot of lifestyle choices for quick cash. \n\nWe only plan on staying in this home for 5 years, which I\u2019m not sure if that matters in evaluating how much extra to put towards principal (if any).  \n\nWe purchased the home the day before a fortune 100 (realistically a fortune 15 company but no one refers to that kind of thing as such) announced plans to put a regional headquarters 4 miles from our home. Property values have been going up exponentially and we anticipate it\u2019ll be much higher in five years. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what You\u2019re going to get out of this but help is always appreciated.\n\nEdit:\nMy soon to be spouse has student debt, but after marriage, I\u2019m going to use some of my 12mo emergency fund to pay off all but the lowest interest federal loans.\n\nEdit 2: just realized I\u2019m not in r/personalfinance and I apologize for the overkill response",

An extra $200 a month will knock about 7 years off the mortgage and save about $49k dollars. Essentially, each extra dollar you pay toward principle right now saves you the banks compounded interest on that dollar for the next 29 years.",

It's paradise, but we are shackled by the mortgage. Worth it...YOLO. We just refinanced it this month at a better rate. Only 30 years to go! Hopefully, we'll be able to pay it off early.\n\nCongrats again. You did it.",

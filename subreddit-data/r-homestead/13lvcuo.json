They spend most of their time in their hutch or under my bed. \n\n\nIf you can buns are really the happiest inside where it's cool and safe. Tractor supply sells some big wire cages with trays and hay feeders for quite cheap. You can do 2 stacks of two which is space efficient. You wanna hang a chew and a water bowl that clips onto the cage. Water bottles are super bad for rabbits. For meat rabbits fine, but pets? Use a water bowl. If you do this you want to affix some wood to the floor so the bunnies don't get sore hocks from the wire. \n\n\nIf you have any bonded pairs they can share a cage. You also want to have a pen with some toys, and give them floor time when you can. \n\n\nIf you do outside you'll want to use proper hutches that will be...considerably more expensive. With shade over the top too. You can build them pretty easy if you're handy. The wire cages are terrible protection from predation. Raccoons will get them 100%. Think a chicken coop just it's all open space basically.  \n\nARBA has more info as well as the House Rabbit Society.",

No one can really give you an accurate approximation better than you.\nOne thing you to that'll dramatically increase the safety is to get a well trained \"working dog.\" I personally have only heard good things about Australian Shepherd.",

The inside of the coop is about 10ft tall, about 8x8 ground area and then an outside run that's also 8x8. Fully secured and plenty of roosting spots inside and out. They don't seem to mind as long as they have plenty of food and water. If we're going to be gone more than two days we leave the door open and they free range all day and then go in at night. Never lost any to predators but we have a Mastiff and a Lab/Husky mix  that stay outside full-time when we're gone. Without dogs  I think it'd be a little risky. The chickens can get high enough that coyotes aren't a problem but raccoons and possums would probably find them eventually.",

I can check them anytime on camera from anywhere and have left them for 2 weeks once without issue other than a bunch of eggs to deal with which i just let hatch anyway. Give them plenty of space and let them do their thing.",

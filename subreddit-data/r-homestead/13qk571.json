We have all kinds, all mixed together. \n\nThe Himalayan are easy to spot with their aggressive growth, fat pentagonal canes, and this easier to keep ahead of. My understanding, though, is the seed bank can be on the order of 10s of thousands per square foot. Gonna be a long haul!\n\nThe nice part is, a lot of the natives seems to do pretty well *underneath* the thickets, protected from predation by the giant mass of thorns. I'm finding lots of salal, snowberry, and others under every thicket I clear.\n\nThe cut leaf variety is also everywhere here, but doesn't seem overly aggressive. I still rip it out, but I don't necessarily go looking for it like I do the Himalayan. \n\nI try to leave the trailing blackberry alone, but it definitely a trip hazard, lol!",

On top of the species.\n\nIt's probably they are different species (leaf shape is suspect), but it's also possible that the single fruit bearing vine is a new sucker, left impeded to grow very long.\n\nIt is well known among gardeners that if you chop the tip of a cane at a predetermined length (ie 6feet) it will invest more energy late summer/all fall into developing its laterals, and as a result produce larger flushes of flowers on them.\n\nThe bushier 1st pic looks like the canes were probably damaged or lopped down, so that the plant invested more energy either pre winter, or post dormancy in spring, into its lateral branches and it's overall yield.\n\nWhereas the 2nd pic the cane/vine is long and thin, requiring much more energy be distributed across it, limiting its yield.",

The most humane thing to do is either release it where it is and raccoon proof your chickens or dispatch it quickly and humanely.",

Unfortunately situations such as this are a hard reality. \n\nI recently had to dispatch a raccoon after it killed two of my ducks in less than a week. But unfortunately my options were to kill the raccoon or keep losing ducks. I'm not getting a fish and game violation for driving somewhere else.\n\nIt somehow managed to get in my duck enclosure, pull one of them through a small gap in the locked hard plastic door on their house, then climb back over the 6 foot tall chain link fence with the duck, and through the hole it had made in the netting on top of the enclosure. I put that netting there to keep predators out and the ducks safe when I'm not home. I generally free range them when I'm home. \n\nTo top it off it was my favorite duck. She had a funny personality and was super friendly, she even had a name. I considered her more of a pet than a farm animal. \n\nI already had well over a thousand bucks wrapped up in the duck enclosure. Putting some wet cat food I already had in a live trap and a .22 shell was my affordable option, if not my only option. I didn't enjoy dispatching the raccoon, but losing my favorite duck after spending a lot of money to keep it safe bothered me more.",

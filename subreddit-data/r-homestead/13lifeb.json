Unless you have a nearby spring on the surface that then flows underground right next to your house, I wouldn't call that spring fed. It's just a shallow groundwater aquifer. Maybe it's deeper because the well was dug in a dry year and thats how deep was required at the time.\n\nPurge the well for two well volumes before trying it, much better yet sending it to a lab to see if it has any fecal matter or heavy metals in it. You want to purge the well with a submersible pump to make your sample/test indicative of the actual groundwater you would get by using the well normally and not whatever junk is floating in there at the moment.",

The pipe comes into my basement and was used to fill a large cistern.  I investigated shortly after purchasing the house, and it turns out the spring is more like a deep artesian well.  Unfortunately, the unit doesn\u2019t have a cap, so debris, branches and small animals have fallen in.  Basically, it\u2019s unusable unless I thoroughly clean &amp; disinfect.  I approached our local well drilling outfit to get an idea what I needed to do, and their recommendation was to remove all debris and pump it out completely.  Let it refill naturally, and dump a gallon of bleach in.  Let it sit for a few days, and pump it out again.  This should be done three times total.\n\nI found the expense, effort and time involved just wasn\u2019t worth it to have a backup drinking water system.  I don\u2019t think you have to worry about the level of contamination as I\u2019ve got in mine, so yours might be worth using for watering the lawn or the garden.",

You can get a hand powered pump for when electric fails (Bison Pumps makes a premium model), or set up a jet pump like I have. It doesn't hurt to test the water first, there are laboratories that do this regularly (a local realtor should know how to go about it if you're in the country).",

I assume you are in the south because that pulls from the aquifer.  Get the water tested and see if it is usable, if it is it will take some work to install a pump to feed your grounds or plants but it's free water.\n\nMake sure to check how often it refills because the usages may vary depending, if it is there you may as well use it.  Could just not be drinking water but useful for agriculture.  If it is not drinkable you can pump it (depending on the refill rate) to a sprinkler or drip system with an automatic timer.\n\n  \nEdit:  Just to add to this, the fun part about those wells is that if you get a hard freeze, the water is always available.  As long as the pump doesn't fail you are golden.  If it is not drinkable you can always get things to purify it in an emergency situation with things like the LifeStraw to keep your family hydrated.  Sucks but ya won't die.",

Then check it for clarity. If it\u2019s cloudy, or if you see critters in it, that will be your answer. If it\u2019s clear and critter free, pour that out and pull off a cup full or so and taste it. If it tastes good and cool, wait a few hours to over night. If you don\u2019t have any adverse effects, you will likely be good to go. Test the well water again at 90 days and then 6 months.

    "postText": "I think she was six years old, I\u2019m unsure because we inherited her and two other laying hens. Found her laying lopsided in the same position as I found her a day ago. Thought maybe she was just being goofy, but after trying to get her to move, she wasn\u2019t able to use her left leg at all. She wouldn\u2019t eat, wouldn\u2019t drink. Took her out into the yard and tried to see if she\u2019d perk up - she just fell on her side and stared at me. She wasn\u2019t acting right at all - if she were human I\u2019d suspect a stroke by her symptoms. \n\n\nShe was a good chicken, and I hope I did right by her and prevented suffering.\n\n\nI got into this journey to have a better connection with my food and nature. I have such a deep respect for these creatures, and I\u2019m glad to be able to share my existence with them, even if it means I have to make difficult choices. I\u2019m humbled by this experience.\n\n\nEdit: Seems I may have a Marek\u2019s virus problem\u2026makes sense, given her symptoms.",

Sometimes nature will create a situation where the most loving thing we can do, is to take away the pain and suffering of an animal. We don't do it to be cruel, but to honor the animals we love alongside and ensure that their entire lives with us were full of good days, where they were treated properly.",

Many over 5. Their job is scratching poop and making sure there are less flies around. The young-ish hens still lay. I get maybe 8 eggs a day from 14. \n\nAnyways; it doesn\u2019t have to be a death sentence but if you want to be a disease free flock then you can if you so choose.",

The little bit of good about this hole thing is when I was digging a hole I took the rocks and put it on top of the dirt so animals wouldn\u2019t dig her up when I got to the top I started stacking rocks and it looked like a chicken. I didn\u2019t intentionally stack it to look like a chicken so I felt all was right with the world and I was forgiven for culling her and she is in a better place now. I still feel guilt she was my pet but I know I did everything for her I can\u2019t save them all.\n\n\n[statue](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16pIDrF5Qx5-MSFI3L1J1ccXjyKv-Vjqa/view?usp=drivesdk)",

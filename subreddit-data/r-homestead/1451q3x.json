    "postText": "Hi guys, I have been tempted to play around with designing a Homestead layout in The Sims, Minecraft, Stronghold, etc. but figured there must be actual software geared towards this. Something that lets you design both buildings and landscape, hopefully with a decent scale. Doesn't need to be super detailed, just wondering if anyone had any experience with this before.",

That's what we're using for the home we'll build on our land, but only because we have to build it from the ground up and get county approvals.   \nPersonally, for the homestead layout, I've been starting with basic, but large grid paper. It lets me get reasonable detail and realistic measurements/spacing.",

Being being able to copy/paste shapes or move a set of objects at once would be handy.\n\nEDIT: I wrote that and then I found this [https://virtual-graph-paper.com/](https://virtual-graph-paper.com/), looks really handy for quickly drawing out whatever.",

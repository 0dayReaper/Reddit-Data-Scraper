I get $14 for a tomato plant but only eight for an herb so until I'm large enough where space isn't at a premium I have to go towards tomatoes and peppers cucumbers and some select pollinator annuals. I totally want to be larger someday though and offer all of that kind of stuff. Thai Basil is awesome I also love growing Thai chilies",

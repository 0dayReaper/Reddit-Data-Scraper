            "comment": "So this is future sheep pasture that is currently wooded and full of brush. \n\nI've been slowly working on adding these two acres onto my current sheep areas. It's all been by hand until last year. We started with removing approximately 60 ailanthus trees several years ago, then worked our way into selective tree clearing, and understory clearing. \n\nSince doing invasive species removal, I've been burning anything worth its weight in firewood, piling up all other debris, and last year our neighbor, who runs a land clearing goat business, used our property as their initial test run. So this small cleared area is an example of what the forest floor looks like once they've been through for two years in a row, and after removing all the junk in the understory. \n\nAs they move through the woods, I wait until they've exhausted an area, then I drop any tree that needs selective clearing to promote healthy silvopasturing, they eat it, and then repeat the cleanup process. \n\nThis winter I plan on fencing the entire area, and over-seeding it with an initial round of grasses and other goodies for our sheep.\n\nI really can't emphasize enough how awful the area was in the before the before pictures. It's been years of work. But this is a great way to clear land if you're not in a huge rush.",

I'll just use it as an example because the second acre wasn't covered much. \n\nIt was like a real jungle though. That one acre is probably going to take 3 weeks now. That's a mix because it was very dense vegetation then and they've cleared it previously, but they're better at their job now. They're not as timid since them, it's straight to work.",

After they ate a bunch of it we didn't have as much older growth.

It's a tasty invasive and we make use of it (like 20 gallons a year of berries) but it's just too much and most of it is inaccessible. \n\nHalf this flock are little mini-goats and most of our wineberries were too tall, so I'd have to chop stuff by hand to the ground daily as they made their way in. They wouldn't eat the thickest parts or some types of briar. \n\nAs last year's growth came back this spring,  they really went at it. I'm hoping their second serving is enough to kill off most of it. \n\nSo there's definitely some limitations, but yeah, they'll really eat like 99% of what you throw in front of them.",

I have a few academic sources, but it would be really great to hear about these experiences directly from the source. Please take a moment to complete this short (anonymous!!) survey if you can! Thank you for your time.",

It does not read as an attempt at genuine empathetic understanding.\n\nIs that what your professor wants?\n\nIs he a lazy asshole who wants to tear communities apart while not even bothering to actually read students' papers?",

A very small fraction of the subreddit will click on the link, and an even smaller amount will actually respond! If someone genuinely becomes upset because of the survey and lashes out at group members as a result, I would say that sense of frustration was there before the google form. Again, I see why you are skeptical, but if you are uncomfortable with the poll you do not have to respond to it.",

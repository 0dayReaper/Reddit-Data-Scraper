I\u2019m thinking about financing a compact tractor but don\u2019t know too much about them. \n\nThe white one is a 2021 bobcat with mower and loader. $13K 100 hrs\n\nThe green is a 2018 John Deere 1023E with mower and loader. $14.5K 150+hrs\n\nShould I go bigger? Are these too expensive? What should I consider? \n\nI want to be able to do multiple jobs including mulching without having to hire expensive contractors since I have no machinery currently. I appreciate your advice!",

Check your local dealer network .. they have 0% right now too\n\nPersonally some options to consider: 3rd function on laolder arms (everything attachments wicked grapple, they are extremely tough, and lightweight so you can lift more) , skid steer quick attach (forks to bucket in 20 seconds), I have industrial tires as a mix between turf and ag tires, loaded tires with beet juice for weight, I have a glass cab for heat / AC but I have a 1600\u2019 driveway to clear in the winter with a rear blower. That\u2019s why the local dealer is so important, sit and talk with them on what specific needs you have and they can help get some things factory\u2026 for attachments everything attachments out of North Carolina makes some of the very best stuff , I\u2019m eyeing their land leveler for maintaining gravel driveway next. Land pride is just ok for some but you really need to understand what you want to do. Are you tilling arces? Are you making hay? Clearing long driveway? I have a small 4\u201d chipper and I make mountains of wood chips for mulch\u2026 stuff like that, we are heating with wood and if not I have piles of brush\u2026. Just some thoughts.",

Mine came with a nifty independent PTO and a rare \"pressure control\" option that gives it traction almost like a 4x4 tractor has.\n\nYou can get old farmalls for a similar price. These machines are dead simple to work on and parts are cheap and plentiful because people are still using them 60+ years on. They just work. They are unquestionably built better than new machines, and most were designed with a mindset that they may need fixing at the farm, not a dealer.\n\nAn older 40-55hp tractor will let you go wild with a bush hog and you'll be less worried about hurting it by driving it through rough brush..just a thought.\n\nIf you are going to get a new machine, go with Kubota.",

Things like run a brush hog and pull a five foot chisel plow. But sill small enough to get in some of the tight places I take it. Like into the woods or the goat pens. There are times I wish it was bigger and other times I wish it was smaller. Over all, most of the time it\u2019s the perfect size. \n\nBack in about 2018 I was looking at new tractors. As soon as they said tear three emissions I went looking for a used one. I found a low hour 2010 Kubota L3700. It\u2019s served me well. \n\nI was a fleet diesel mechanic/supervisor. 80 to 85 percent of the on road failures we had were a direct or indirect result of the emissions equipment. EGR valves become clogged with soot. Diesel Particulate Filters that would fail to regen and became clogged. And the urea system (aka diesel exhaust fluid, diesel after treatment, diesel exhaust fluid and DEF) would fail and then you have all the related electrics and sensors. The first tool you need to work on these systems is a laptop with proprietary program that had a yearly subscription fee. Remember, warranties on emissions systems only last about ten years. After that it\u2019s all on you. \n\nWhen these systems fail they will shut you down. Sometimes with little or no warning and are expensive to repair. We bought a new fleet of 50 vehicles and Cummins needed an annex at our shop for all of the warranty work they were doing. In the first year the did three fleet wide computer updates to the ECM to correct issues with the urea system. If you are in a cold climate urea will freeze. So you will need a place to plug the tractor it. One note about urea (DEF). It isn\u2019t needed to run the vehicle/tractor. So the ECM is programmed to electronically shut the engine off it you run out of DEF. Or if the system detects it\u2019s not working as it should. \n\nI had to deal with this stuff 40 to 50 hours a week at work. The last thing I wanted to do was to deal with it at home.",

We have an older 12hp Kubota B6000 (1973) 4WD tractor. It came with a loader, York rake, rear weight, Woods finish mower, and the original Kubota rototiller, all for $6K nearly twenty years ago. That was probably overpriced, but it still runs just fine with next to no maintenance and long ago paid itself off in saved labor. These B6000s are perhaps the smallest \"real\" tractor ever made. Certainly one of the smallest, and damn near indestructible. I decided, for no good reason, that I needed a bigger one a few years ago, so bought a B7200, a couple sizes up with a loader and backhoe. It took me only about three years to realize I didn't need the bigger one, hardly used it, but what I really needed was the B6000 and a new riding mower that could blast around our grass much faster than any tractor. We manage eight acres on two properties, of which we have two acres of lawn. We raise sheep, and grow a 110 by 80 foot garden. The tractor moves snow and compost, tills the garden, and lifts heavy objects (most recently a new heat oil tank). There are occasional days when I need more power, but my neighbor has a Deere skid steer and has realized the value of the Kubota tiller and York rake and so will trade. You can find a decent older Kubota fairly easily in most parts of the US, but there are other brands that last as long and as well. Size the tractor to 90% or 95% of the regular work, which if it's like our needs will lead to big savings in purchase price, size, fuel efficiency, and maintenance costs. Then save save the extra several thousand to buy some time with guy who has bigger equipment for the very few days you will actually need it. And yes, a big guy looks like a fool on a little tractor. But I don't care.",

            "comment": "People in this thread are seriously misinformed. I'm a professional agricultural technician and buying parts and repairing a John Deere is the exact same as any other brand. A bit pricier sure, but repair and parts are no different. To answer your question, both are fine machines but my experience with kioti / bobcat warranty has been poor. For compact tractors, Kubota or Deere is the way to go and with being under 25hp, you don't have to worry about many emissions systems on your engine.",

            "comment": "Look at Kioti brand. Way better price and the Kubota or JD. All tractor are the same more or less look at the new efficiency rules and how they deal with emissions. Some require expensive special exhaust replacement parts some use a regeneration process at high RPMs. \nTest drive and hit bumps while in the seat. Can you see your self sitting in that seat for 4, 6, or 8 hours? \nWatch YouTube videos on maintenance for different brands. Can you do it or only dealer? What part\u2019s required at 50, 100, 200 hours?\n\nWhere do you live a cab is nice when hot or cold. Mowing a field with dust and bugs a cab gives you a more clean environment to be in also. \nAll dealers will have super financings deals. Include basic attachments bucket loader w/ scraper blade, front forklift forks, mower ( flail or hog style?) include trailer to yet it home or take back to dealer for service/ warranty? \nA midsize would be better the one too small, always think how many PTO to horsepower needed to run any three point attachments you might want in the future, ( it gets addicting to have more attachments!) more toys!\nI would honestly look at a minimum of at least 35hp but not go larger then 50hp from your description of need. This is a generational purchase if cared for. Buy once so it is cheaper then having to upgrade later at a loss if the original purchase price.",

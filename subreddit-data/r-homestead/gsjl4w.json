It filled me with such nostalgia. He always grew corn every summer. Also tomatoes and a couple other things. It was so delicious and fresh. We would cut up the tomato slices, cover them in freshly cracked pepper, and then fry an egg for breakfast. It was delicious. The corn we would grill all the time and cover it in butter. \n\nThank you for the kind memories stranger! \n\n**Hugs in internet**",

Still enough to do three sisters planting (I add sunflowers to make it four) and feed my family a variety of food grown from generations of saved seeds, whole slowly turning the rest of the acreage into an edible landscape using native plants and permaculture. \n\nEveryone's space looks different, and a fancier layout doesn't mean someone's just a rich idiot who doesn't know a thing about homesteading. I still have plenty to learn, but I know a \"practical\" layout like this would be decimated by the herd of deer we have traveling through daily.

Apricots my favourite though but apricots won't grow here as we don't get enough chill hours.\n\nI'm currently really pleased with the progress of my garlic, elephant garlic, chillis, potato onions, potatoes, carrots and radishes. What radishes and carrots are you growing? I planted some bush beans really late in our season and they look really lame to the point I think I'll replace them with something else and just rip them out. Season limit: discovered.

We've got some \"Mr Stripey\" tomatoes too, as well as a self-sustaining yellow cherry tomato that just denies mortality every year going on 5 now, it's humongous. We just put cucumbers, zucchini, and mini-watermelons in the ground. My mom found a regular watermelon seed her uncle had given her as a kid and we tried to propagate just to see, and it came up! I'm excited, should have an absolute buttload of tomatoes this year!",

I grew some stripey Roma's last season but didn't have a great tomato season as I was away for most of it. The year before I had so many tomatoes it was overwhelming. I bottled heaps, froze heaps, etc My favourite was Jaunne Flamme an orange tomato. Hope you get your tomato bounty!!! Also I enjoyed growing the Golden stuffer tomato which I made lots of stuffed tomato dishes with. I had so many I even deseeded trays full and had them like frozen shells ready to stuff. I love that your mum got that watermelon seed to grow! Satisfying!! Right now I'm drowning in chokos and pumpkins - lots of long bendy gramma pumpkins and JAP pumpkins. I have a \"pumpkin bookshelf\". Who needs books when you've got pumpkins?? Lol.",

Corn takes an incredible amount nutrients out of the ground, and after a couple of seasons you will see reduction in yields for a couple of reasons. But crop rotation will help tremendously.\n\nFor example, on my farm we would rotate fields between corn and soybeans (and occasionally throw a year of wheat in on some of the smaller fields). Soy beans don\u2019t offer humans anything really for nutrition so it\u2019s probably not what your looking for in a garden but I\u2019m pretty sure anything in the legume family will put nitrogen back into the soil and there are plenty of other garden type plants that will accomplish the same thing. We used a 2 year rotation but you can set up 3 and 4 year rotations too.\n\nCrop rotation helps with these main things:\n\n- Put nutrients back into the ground to help ensure a good yield year after year and reduces the need to fertilize.\n- Plants are prone to specific diseases that other plants aren\u2019t affected by and by rotating year after year the disease will not have a host and will die out so that when you go back to the first crop the disease will have died out.\n- Reduces the need to control insects. Basically the same thing about diseases but for bugs.\n\nIf it\u2019s feasible, I would suggest having 2 patches of ground (for a 2 year plan, 3 patches for 3 year, and so on) in order to allow you to grow each crop every year. If adding another bed next year isn\u2019t feasible you can still half and half the patch you do have currently and just flip the crops from one side to the next year over year.",

Maybe that's my problem. I did get a nice late harvest of about 10 ears of a hybrid sweet corn but that was a last ditch try and it was funny they did better than the ones I really tried on.\n\nSoil seems to really matter too - I used to have clay loam in a cooler climate now I have red sandy loam in a hotter climate. This dries out so much faster. I'm still adapting. I grew some amazing field corn in my old place, it was nearly twice my height and so vigorous with multiple ears. I think sweet corn and popcorn look so disappointing in comparison as plants! Lol kicking myself I didn't save seed but maybe wouldn't have done as well here anyway. \n\n\nI had a large patch I wanted covered in corn here. The popcorn I planted as a three sisters with some tepary beans and delicata squash but some kiwanos took over everything from next bed. (the monsters!) I still got some corn and some delicata but not many tepary beans. I wouldn't do tepary beans again even if they were the recommended 3 sister variety - too bushlike in growth. I'll tell you what I have learnt previously with sweetcorn - if you're going to do 3 sisters be careful how tall the pole beans grow. U don't want bush but you don't want taller than the corn either, of which height depends on type and variety a LOT. Also it's important the corn is up for a few weeks before planting the beans to give it a headstart. It's also better for maize corn and storage variety of beans and pumpkins else to pick the beans you have to walk amongst the corn and tangle. Pita really.\n\nNot that I'm an expert! Germinating it is my Achilles. I think just a patch of corn by itself in a block is fine and makes harvest and worm control easier. Make sure you post us pics of your harvest, I'm excited for you!",

The best we can tell, from polling hundreds of friends and professionals in the veterinary/pet supply fields, he is part Catahoula Leopard Dog and part Australian Cattle Dog. There are possibly a few other breeds in him. When I searched for catahoula x heeler cross, someone was breeding them and called them Cataheelers. That is why I figured I would call him #ScoutTheCataheeler \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\udc4d",

Indoors we try to limit the amount of mud and straw that make it in the house. We did however buy him a brand new straw bale, just for him, to tear up as much as he wants outside. Will have to post up a vid when we let him loose on it. He tore up our last bale that we set in the garden for mulch. He is a good helper! \ud83d\ude02",

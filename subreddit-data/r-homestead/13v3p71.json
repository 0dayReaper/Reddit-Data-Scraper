    "postText": "I recently watched a YouTube video where someone went through all the trouble of buying a mini truck from alibaba. It got me thinking and I searched for tractors and I found a bunch of extremely cheap equipment compared to what prices in western countries are. Now I know almost nothing about tractors but it got me thinking. Either they are cheap because they are just cheap pieces of junk or they are cheap because you are buying directly from the manufacturer, and could be potentially obtaining equipment without the markup of a reputable brand that probably manufactures in China anyway. So basically my question is has anyone bought homestead equipment particularly vehicles from alibaba and if so how is it going?",

Oh, and the reviews must be in the hundreds, if not thousands. The product itself will never be as good and durable as a branded one, but you can definitelly find some hidden gems if you put some effort in the research.",

Haven't heard any complaints, other than the Port of Montreal holding it for a couple days for inspections that caused extra fees for the shipping container.",

Each unit operated as expected. There was obvious details that showed it was a Chinese, but the functions still did what I asked if them. Details like dust boots missing over shifters and levers. Cheap \"woodgrain\" dashboard. Subpar paint job. \n\n  Of the one I used most, it was a 2 ton loader, and  I used to to clear snow, move dirt and rocks, scoop and move old shingles, and even pulled out a stump.",

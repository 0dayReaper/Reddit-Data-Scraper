I\u2019m on Long Island. I\u2019m wondering what i should do for my animals: chickens, ducks, goats, horses. \n\nThanks, and stay safe everyone.",

            "comment": "If you've got your animals confined in a building with poor airflow, you could try putting a DIY box fan air cleaner in their space to see if that improves the indoor air quality. Ultimately though, the stress on animals of trying to bring them inside usually outweighs the benefits of slightly cleaner air. \n\nIdeally, give the critters access to a varied environment so they can hang out in whatever places they find most comfortable. Breathing smoke isn't great for critters, but they're relatively short-lived compared to humans, so the lifetime health risks like \"you'll have an elevated cancer risk in 10-20 years\" are of relatively lower impact compared to how those risks work out for people.",

            "comment": "From the west coast here, this is not an unusual occurrence for us. We've had to evacuate before and the sky was almost pitch black with thick wildfire smoke, ash, and sparks at 3pm (literally looked like hell). I didn't know what to do so I opened everyone's pens so they at least had a chance to run if the fire actually hit on us, instead of a few miles away.\n\nWhile evacuated I came back approximately 2-3 times and would throw out a sprinkler to tamp down the ash debris that had already landed. All of our chickens survived. If you live in or near New York proper, you're probably a concrete jungle and don't have too much to worry about. The box fan/whole house furnace filter and tape is an ok method in a pinch but your critters will probably be just fine.",

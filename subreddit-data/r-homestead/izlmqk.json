The idea of native species being a good thing in their own right, without a dedicated use, is really less than 100 years old. \n\n1700s people did things for their own reasons. Now, we view the world differently, and that requires unpicking a lot of their mistakes.",

Last year they made a burrow under my neighbors shed and I got to watch a mama rear a litter of kits. I got to watch them grow, play, learn how to hunt, tease my dog, all kinds of things. I love them because they keep the local squirrels and rabbits in check, and away from my garden.\n\nBut if you're in Australia and they're wrecking your ecosystems, shoot those little bastards. It's not their fault but they have to go anyway. Hell I'd even help if I didn't live on the completely opposite side of the world.",

I asked a friend from the Ministry of Natural Resources what the best course of action is :ie: bury him (?) but she said to just leave him. We have a few foxes here are there. We have 167 acres of land that is part fields, part boreal forest. We also have deer, moose, coyote, wolves, martins, beavers, bears, eagles, owls, etc. In our 5+ years here, this is our first time coming across something like this. We usually see a lot of deer bits though.",

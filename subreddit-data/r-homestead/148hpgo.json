I also have a hen in isolation for a foot injury. However, the outdoor numbers look like this:\n\n- The Chicken Formerly Known as Prince (white chantecler) has 8 hens to himself in the old barn.\n- Ruby the big BCM has 5 girls to himself in the big coop in the new barn.\n- Lucky the bantam has 4 girls to himself in a coop we call \u2018the loft\u2019 in the new barn. \n\nIdeally, each boy has about 10 girls; we lost seven girls since winter. I have six purebred BCM chicks, six Japanese/OEG bantam chicks, and one purebred OEG bantam chick currently in with a broody. I have two other broodies sitting on nests as of this past weekend, so I\u2019m going to get organized and put eggs under them ASAP. \n\nThey roost in separate stalls at night but have enough space and resources to roam free during the day with very little fuss. The roosters have little spats like this daily, but it never escalates. I want to point out again that Lucky went OUT OF HIS WAY to go start shit with Prince because Prince is gullible AF. Ruby intervened because he doesn\u2019t like fighting. Ruby has also stopped fights between cats, ducks, and other hens. Ruby has a zero tolerance policy on workplace violence. \n\nI\u2019ve had to catch Ruby and pull him away when the drakes fight because drakes will fight to the death and take Ruby with them like he\u2019s collateral damage. When the drakes fight we just get everyone else out of the way and try to keep the boys out of the pond (they absolutely will drown one another). The drakes we also keep at a 7+ to 1 ratio, ducks to drakes. Our old man, Mephistopheles, is almost 7yo. He goes to the chicken coop at night because Digby (3yo) and Magda 18mos) hassle him. Magda will stick around long enough for two clutches and then he\u2019ll be off to the freezer. Digby doesn\u2019t fight with Messy when it\u2019s just the two of them.",

I know my animals, their dispositions, and their habits; these three roosters are behaving in a safe and healthy way. If at any point their well-being were in jeopardy you can bet your ass I wouldn\u2019t stand around and film for the fun of it. \n\nThis video isn\u2019t \u2018cockfighting.\u2019 It\u2019s three well-rounded roosters evaluating and asserting their places in the flock\u2019s hierarchy and then moving on with their day.",

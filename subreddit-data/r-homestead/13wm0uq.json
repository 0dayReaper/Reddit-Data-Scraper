We just got a new belt for it, so maybe that is the problem.   Michigan had terrible weather in May, so I'm behind with planting.  Lol, when a baby chick got away this morning, I realized I must be having a bad day.  Thank you for your idea.",

Even a baby chicken got loose, ran into a patch of wild raspberry bushes, and got lost.  The rotor tiller is mysteriously loosened up and working again today.  Just one of those days when nothing wants to go right, I guess.",

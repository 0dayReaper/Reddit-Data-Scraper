    "postText": "A friend of mine recently visited a European country this last winter, in the EU. When they returned they found an acorn in their pants pocket (they claim). I\u2019m guessing they picked it up to look at better at the hotel and forgot about it. They decided to put it in an indoor plant pot and forgot about it until now. It has sprouted and a nice little tree is growing. I\u2019m not sure if what they did is necessarily legal and even more importantly I\u2019m afraid it will be invasive if they continue to grow it. What should we do with this plant? Feel free to share in other spaces that seem more relevant to my problem.",

            "comment": "People are only talking about invasive/non-invasive but my worry would be agricultural pests. That\u2019s most of the reason you aren\u2019t allowed to bring live plants and animals across most borders: the possibility of introducing a new disease to a new ecosystem. This is how chestnut blight, Japanese beetle, and hemlock woolly adelgid got to the US. Even if you can\u2019t see anything, there might be eggs, viruses, or bacteria incubating inside your innocuous seedling. The oak might grow slowly but whatever hitched a ride on it might not.",

The classic case is that a tree that evolved with the pest (Asian Chestnuts, fungus) can fight it off. They evolved defenses over generations.\n\nA naive host (American Chestnut) does not have these defenses. The same pathogen that's a minor pest to its classic host is a death sentence to its novel host.\n\nIt's not worth it. We have these rules for good reason. Sorry people on Reddit think they know better.",

Check if that species is already growing in your state. If it's an oak, it's not likely to be a problem and is probably already established in your area.",

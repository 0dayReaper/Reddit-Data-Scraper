For most meat is this bloodless shrink wrapped product you get at the grocery. Most don\u2019t get the experience of having to raise an animal, falling in love with it, and then bringing it to slaughter.\n\nAlso how do you properly respect meat? So far it seems like memes are disrespectful. But killing the animal\u2019s for its meat is respectful.",

Primarily because it\u2019s low quality and the treatment of the animals is horrific.  Many grocery store meat animals NEVER even see the light of day.  Much less ground (factory farms are horrific). We wanted choices too beyond chicken (Cornish cross), Turkey (broad breast), pork and beef.  \n\nWe have rabbit, heritage chickens, heritage turkeys, Muscovy duck (red meat, tastes like venison), goat and beef from our farm.  Each of those animals has other \u201cutility\u201d as well.  Chickens lay eggs, birds have feathers for fishing lures and crafts.  Pekin ducks have fat that can be rendered for cooking.  Muscovy ducks can be brooders/ncubators.  Everything cuts/eats our grass so we don\u2019t have as much lawn to cut.   The poop fertilizes the field and rabbit poop fertilizes our veggie garden.  Rabbit furs can be tanned\u2026 turkeys bust up the steer poop spreading it around.  Birds eat bugs\u2026 so much more than only meat.  \n\nwe are only 1 year into this and we are almost completely off grocery meat (our steer has another year still so we do buy beef now)",

I treat them all like they are my babies. They get pampered and scratches etc. It still weighs on me when I process them. They all get a hug and a thank you before I do it. They also get their favorite snacks beforehand as well. None of them die hungry. The hardest thing is when I share with someone else and I find out that they \u201cjust threw it away\u201d. This just makes me angry.\n\nRegarding predators, I\u2019ve got a certain amount that I foresee will be lost to nature and I actually find this part to be alright. I\u2019ve mentally written that off. I see it as sharing with wildlife, since we as people take so much of their habitat. This is only fair. I actually welcome it, since they have always taken one here or there and none have killed for fun. I get kestrels, eagles, owls, and hawks that will grab one or two every now and then, but the rabbits can hold their own for the most part.\n\nIt is funny how two people across the internet can do the same types of things for the same reasons and have a completely different outlook. :)",

It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s the same animals or not - everyone works it different.  All of the differences I soak in for whatever I implement at ours.  \n\nI love our animals.  I personally don\u2019t have a hard time dispatching them when needed.   There is this silly little rooster we have now.  He doesn\u2019t fit our plan (I am making my own chicken breed for meat and eggs for my farm).  I have been checking him out to see how big he is and if he is of size.  I also play with him a little bit - carry him around.   Some birds are named even so my family can talk about them.  But we all know what their utility is.  \n\nI view it like this: the flock/herd is greater than any individual within.  It\u2019s a collective not each.  So with that view the roosters will cause problems for the hens and other roosters and need to be handled.  We took our time to raise them, our reward is the meat.  \n\nThe hardest animal I am going to have to dispatch is this little triplet goat.  She is dwarf size and very thin due to no colostrum left when she was born.  We tried to fatten her up and she won\u2019t.   She isn\u2019t much for meat but we cannot breed her - that will kill her.   She won\u2019t do well without her sisters but her sisters are our main goats\u2026. She has to go - and she IS a sweetheart.  That one is going to be difficult and I\u2019m not even ready yet but I will have to be in a few weeks",

When you see so much dark and horrifying things they need a outlet and a sense of humor can help process it in a less heavy way. Humor can be a source of dealing with grief or other heavy emotions. So this may or may not be from something similar. I am not going to judge when that humor isn't hurting anyone.",

You could definitely argue that homesteading contributes to society, but it largely benefits the homesteader. While killing your cow is traumatic in a way, it of course pales in comparison to the lives experiences of police officers and paramedics. Same can be said for those who have mentioned the military and war. \n\nThat being said, the dark humor used by those mentioned are used as a coping mechanism for serious traumatic events done largely for the benefit of others. This situation is someone going through something mildly difficult in comparison done for their own benefit. Also, officers, paramedics, hospital workers, soldiers, etc. don't often pose with the dead people they're dealing with and post it online.",

We raise our own meat and take great pride in the food we have.  It\u2019s not cheaper if you buy cheap food in the grocery store but it costs less than \u201corganic\u201d food.  (And our is that - but we can\u2019t label that because of legalities)\n\nOur animals live good lives.  They often even produce more animals for us to raise and eat/use. Farmers also don\u2019t look at individual animals but rather the health of the herd/flock they have.   Farming is hard work with really no reward in society (which is fine - my wife and I are introverts).  The reward comes from seeing what we made come together and that takes care of us.",

I honestly don't understand.   The cow was raised, presumably, thoughtfully and well. It,  presumably,  had a great and pampered life and died quickly before it knew what happened. \n\n[I am 100% against any animal abuse. We have a farm and our animals are guarded, well fed,  given treats, and when the time comes,   dispatched very quickly,  humanely, and in the most stress free way for the animal possible.]\n\nSo, back to the cow....It was slaughtered. It is dead. \n\nCows don't get their feelings hurt by jokes,  even before, and especially after, they are dead. \n\nThe cow wasn't a noble creature who jumped in front of a moving train to push a baby out of the way (so it didn't \"sacrifice himself\"). It is livestock. \n\nSo who or what is ACTUALLY being offended here?  It isn't the cow,  so who?\n\nWhat is the ACTUAL and real damage being done here?\n\nI mean, to make a jokes about a dead person to a loved one,  or even a dead pet to a mourning owner,  is to disrespect the OWNER.  It hurts the FAMILY member.   It is insulting to the grieving. \n\nBut none of us knew this cow.  It wasn't our pet or even our 4h project that we sold. Why is it necessary for us to get angry (I am presuming that those who are angry or upset want the rest of us to be as well)?\n\nAnd the owners themselves made the joke.   So we are not mocking their grief. \n\nAnd they aren't even making the joke in front of other cows (if we really want to be weirdly ridiculous).  \n\nCould someone explain what I am missing?",

I'm planning on eating the meat, using the guts for fish bait, giving my dog the feet and heads, and figuring out if there's something to make use of the feathers, because I would feel disrespectful if I wasted any part that could be used. And knowing my ducks were raised happy and well cared for is a lot better than eating a store bought chicken that grew up crammed in a tiny cage surrounded by thousands of other chickens shoved in tiny cages.\n\nI'm also a full organ donor and tell everyone close to me, you better make dang sure every single part of me that can be used, is used. So I guess it's kinda the same thought process. When I'm done with it, make sure it's used to help someone.",

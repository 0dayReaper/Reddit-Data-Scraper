They can run well, we have a +50 yo MF 35X tractor and it runs well, we just had to import a few brake system parts from the UK.\nWe also had a MF backhoe, but we sold it to some mechanic, he restored it. Wes did a few vids about his agony rebuilding a whole MF backhoe and recently he had some engine/transmission issues https://youtu.be/I_5wuQP-SAE",

It works, but the rims will eventually rot out \n\nAssuming the engine is in good shape and everything else works as it should, not a terrible buy. The front loader is probably run off a diverter valve. You'll be able to run either the loader or the three point, but not both at the same time. The valve will have two positions, one for the loader, and the other for the three point.",

It's clearly used, but doesn't look beat to hell.  2 stage clutch, will run a 6 ft bushhog, and rated for 3 bottom plows (depending on soil).  Should also run a 6 ft tiller.  Fluid in the tires will eventually rust the rims (I've replaced 1 rim in 40 years).  You'll also need to be careful about running over thorns because you can't just plug a fluid filled tire.  As others have mentioned, the trip loader is more of a wheelbarrow/carry-all than a loader.  People have welded on a cylinder and made them tip, but I'm not sure how effective they would be.  I would convert it to electronic ignition.  Full disclosure, I have a 35 Ferguson and a 150 Massey Ferguson.  Dad grew tobacco and hay with them for years and I still make hay with them.\n\n\nThat being said, I found this exact listing on facebook marketplace.  The guy that has it looks like a dealer or a buy at auction repair something and flip it.  If it didn't sell well at auction, there's usually a story.  If you're not a mechanic, proceed with caution.",

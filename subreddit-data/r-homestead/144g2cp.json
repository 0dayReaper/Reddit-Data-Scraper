I tired to keep the soil from getting too compacted when I first planted. maybe it needs to be kind of tilled periodically to keep it loose? and I'm not sure what you mean by not being hilled enough. I was growing them in grow bags. I have 4 more bags that I will leave in for another month. Any advice you can offer would be appreciated.",

Over-watering can cause the same problem, it washes the nutrients out of the soil so the potatoes don\u2019t get big.\n\nWith potatoes you can\u2019t plant them and leave them\u2014you need to keep hilling soil ontop of them. Google \u201chow to hill potatoes\u201d.",

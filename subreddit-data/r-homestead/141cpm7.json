Travel with the bucket as low as practical and try and only dump while on level ground, at least side to side level. Also, if you're picking up loose loads to dump into something tall or piling loose materials watch for stuff falling off the back/top of the bucket if you don't curl it down as you raise the loader arms.",

The newer ones are probably a lot more economical in terms of fuel burn, but if anything goes wrong with them all the money you saved on fuel gets shoveled into the dealer-only service process.\n\nI like older equipment, myself.  If you can find the pointy end of a screwdriver in less than two tries, you have a chance at effecting a proper repair.  New stuff, you need screwdrivers in four sizes and six different points, a laptop and access privilege granted by the manufacturer.  It might be cruder, but older equipment lets me work on it without begging, \"Mother, may I?\"",

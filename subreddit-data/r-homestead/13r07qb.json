    "postText": "Hey all! I'm working on picking up about 500 acres in three intervals. The first lot is 100 acres and the two adjoining lots are 200 each. All three lots have not been touched in over 100 years so they have a heavy tree canopy over them. There's a decent creek and 5+ acres lake for water access on this first round. I personally like the cover and am hoping to preserve as much as possible. \n\nOutside of 10-15 acres for a home and crops, what kind of animals do well with a heavy tree canopy? I really doubt cows like to graze on pine needles so hoping to get some ideas to help for planning. Thank you in advance!!!",

Silvopasture is a wooded pasture - can support anything really but it takes time.   We have a grassy field on the edge of the woods.  I cleared it a little bit there is lots of shade.  \n\nTurkeys fit here - their coop is in the pasture.  We have some goats and a steer in the pasture with the turkeys.   A LGD protects the field.  Chickens roam our yard with Muscovy ducks.  We have a grow out coop for the little ones\u2026 only 9 acres but couldn\u2019t ask for more.  We are only using about 2 of it now",

Goats do well in forested land, but they\u2019re hard to fence and require a good deal of daily upkeep (water, minerals, if they\u2019re horned I\u2019d be real worried about them getting stuck in trees, they\u2019re not always the brightest). I love my goats so much but they can be a bit of a headache. Pigs will help clear out underbrush as well but can be too destructive. Some ppl want this to clear our forested lands. IMO it\u2019s better to work with nature than against her, a forest is a home to a lot of critters and we should always strive to make room for what\u2019s already there. So if you\u2019re wanting to keep the forest a forest I would make pens and move the goats monthly to different big pasture pens and you\u2019ll have a thriving forest forever. Pigs will likely do more damage and root more, tilling up a lot of the underbrush. But some ppl want this to make room for grass based pasture. \n\nI don\u2019t have them but I\u2019ve also heard that Scottish Highlander cattle do well in forests.",

Get some Nubian goats and you'll have high quality milk (and any dairy products you can produce from milk) plus a kid or two annually (chevon, especially when young, is excellent meat).  Chickens would benefit from the dense canopy as well, reducing visibility from their avian predators.  This would provide you with both meat and eggs; they'll need a coop for sleeping &amp; laying eggs.  Quail are another excellent option, but they would require cages wrapped in 1/2\" hardware cloth and must not be directly on the ground, since quail are on the menu of everything!  Ditto, rabbits.  Pine needles can be used as bedding for your poultry too and then composted for your kitchen garden.",

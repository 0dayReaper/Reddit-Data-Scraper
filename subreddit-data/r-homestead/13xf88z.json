            "comment": "There were a ton of factors that went into it. I would have bought a different place only if my budget had been radically different. We are on the eastern end of Medina Co. TX, equidistant to the towns of Lytle, Natalia, and Lacoste. We closed on the property in January 2022 and moved in that May after pretty much gutting the house down to the studs and building it back up. \n\n- It was in an area I was familiar with, knew all the close by towns\n- close enough to commute to my 9-5 job that's funding this misadvanture\n- It fit the budget, its only 10 acres and there were certain trade offs here and there but ultimately, its what we wanted. \n- It had been a small goat farm so it has alot of facilities and and stuff.\n- its on the county irrigation canal and while I can purchase access to water, I get a ton of seepage. Unfortunately, the drought last year induced the authority running it to perform some maintenance and upgrades that took longer than expected and a very wet May meant no one had really been clamoring for it. Also, its pretty. On the main trunk where I live, there is an almost tropical greenway that's a very pleasant walk.\n-Trees....I have 5 massive pecans and a previous owner planted decidedly not native pine trees which are nice. I have 3 massive ash trees that need to be removed, though. \n- Room to grow...if I ever get my shit together, there is a 14 acre tract on my southern border that is completely abandoned and over grown. The owners, per county records, is a law firm. We are in a budget crunch and so many projects on the house and homestead stuff that its not an option. We are lying low, hoping no one does anything and when we are financially able, we can call them up, explain our situation and get a fair deal on it. \n- It was just nice. Well maintained. A nice yard, well laid out pastures. \n- the barn, an old grain barn that's a good 30\" elevated and solid as a rock. Its 14 X 60ish foot dimensions with super high ceilings. One end is my wood working shop, one end is my wife's sewing studio, and the center section is general storage and whatnot. \n-In part due to the seepage from the canal, the soil is amazing and incredibly fertile. The grass is amazing and for multiple reasons, we started with cattle and they are all fat and happy. We are really pushing our limits because I keep picking up orphans from family members and we are going to reduce our herd down very soon, but we are officially on calf watch as my bull arrived on Oct 4th. \n\nI could probably go on. I love it and despite being woefully behind schedule on pretty much everything, and very content and comfortable. We have a date to take a steer to the butcher in July and expecting the first new calf any moment now. (have 1 older cow and 4 heifers - 1 is definitely any second, the old cow is impossible to tell because she is so large and I really need to pull last year's calf off of her because he's a total momma's boy). We are getting chickens tomorrow, as the coop is finally complete and all the supplies are in place. We have sourced them from a place down the road that comes highly recommended. \n\nOur garden has been great. Some successes, some lessons, and some \"whoops\". Tomatoes have been okay, cucumbers very good and now I am a pickle maker, zucchini is monstrous and prolific, all the herbs are great, none of the peppers did much of anything. We got one half sized bell pepper this year :/\n\nAnyhow, damn, I'm rambling. \n\n\n-",

I\u2019m surrounded by public lands for hiking and recreation which is just as important to me as farming. I\u2019m ok with the challenges since the trade off is lack of traffic and pollution. I love my life here but I understand most people wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s important to know thyself.",

My only regret is we purchased *before* it was en vogue to plaster your political leanings all over your front yard, bumper, truck flags.  The area we're in isn't quite as friendly to the highly melanated such as myself and had that been as obvious then as it is now, we probably would have looked elsewhere.  Even so, in all the years we've had the property we've only had one outright random act of racism.\n\nI still wouldn't give it up, I don't think.  Not unless we could find something better for the same price and as far as I know, that doesn't exist.  It'd be nice to have better land with trees or a creek, of course.  But those cost WAY WAY more than what we paid.  So in the end, considering our budget, I'm totally happy with where we are and what we've got.  I just wish the area were a little more...accepting.",

The property we chose also has road access and electricity on the property line, which is a big deal. We had to pay a lot more per acre, but it was worth it for us. \n\nSome finer points - we also considered getting property that had been used as pasture, but instead chose property that's been left natural for a long time. Rehabbing after slash n burn would actually feel good I think to accomplish, but we didn't want to take it on, even though we could have gotten a lot more land for the same money. Rehab is needed because in the tropics, if you turn jungle into cattle pasture, it doesn't fare well (which is why they have to keep slash/burn more and more rainforest to supply beef), and what little fertility is in the soil is rapidly depleted. Ours has a full canopy, giving immediate ability to plant food bearing plants that would wither in a sunny pasture.\n\nThere's a lot more \"why\" behind choosing the area, but not relevant to this r/",

            "comment": "Southern Maine. I grew up in Florida and always loved Maine. When we moved here it was primarily for my husband\u2019s job. We threw our net over New England in general and he landed a good job where we are. My husband is a native Mainer so that played a huge role in choosing to move here after he got out of the military. At the time homes were cheap in comparison to where we lived before and the lifestyle is everything we wanted for our kids. We don\u2019t have as much land as I\u2019d like. Compared to our 0.02 acre lot in our last city it was a lot of land (we\u2019re on 2.02 acres now). The house and land checked all the boxes on our list and was within our price range. We\u2019d love more land but real estate prices and interest rates are too high so we work with what we have. Maine is homestead and farming friendly, even though the growing season is short, and I\u2019ve found more likeminded people here than anywhere I\u2019ve ever lived. I honestly love living here and hope it doesn\u2019t change so much that we feel forced to leave.",

    "postText": "Ok, this may sound wierd but I have a strange hesitancy to eat the food I grow/raise. I have been growing vegtables, fruit, and quail for a few years now. But when ever I harvest I always am hesitant to eat it. For some reason I feel it is not as clean as store bought food even though I know it is way better. Not only fresh but grown without chemicals, raised and butchered in an ethical manner. I eat everything I produce but I am so angry about this and know I have been brainwashed to think this way. Am I the only one who thinks this way? Is there a way to combat this beside the old re-conditioning of my thought process.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for input. Very happy I am not the only one experiencing this. My take from the response is I either have a conditioned reponse to the marketing of the grocery store and/or imposter syndrome because I am not confident in myself/experience of growing/raising food. Tried to respond to everyone but I at least liked everyones post (except that one guy).  It does help to get anothers perspective. Will keep growing and eating what I produce. \nThanks again.",

I've been learning more about microbiology and \"germs\" that grow on food and how most of them our bodies actually need to break down that food.  Preservatives are embalming chemicals and can fuck up your gut health real quick.\n\nIt's just a thing where you have to reprogram your brain how to thing.  We've been brainwashed to never touch anything with a bad spot or eat anything \"rotting\".... but...  if it isn't \"rotting\" (going through microbiological breakdown) then it's no good for us.  When you eat something, you chew it up real good, it has to go through a similar process of breakdown in order for out bodies to use it.  And I think many of the diseases these days are caused by preservatives, antibiotics, antimicrobial, pasteurization,  and not eating enough foods that are fermenting.  The more studies that I read, the more I believe that Hippocrates was right in his adamant assertion that ALL disease begins and is treated in the gut.  As pretty much every disease (yes, including fibromyalgia, Alzheimers and MS) has an associated overgrowth of a potentially harmful bacteria which is caused by a damaged, weakened or missing good bacteria that keeps it in balance.  Or a missing bacteria altogether.",

I just haven't wanted to get that paper trail started.\n  But germs and contamination are everywhere all the time.  The important thing is the balance of good cultures versus bad cultures.  \n I've done some things I would not recommend to push past certain mental blocks.  But sometimes it's about having the knowledge and understanding and being able to push past the dogma or irrational...  like if you have a fear of clowns and you eventually push past to give one a high five, then you make it your next goal to give 5 a high five, then 10, then give 3 a handshake and eventually give one a hug... the irrational fear will still be there.  But when we take baby steps to control it, rather than letting it control us... eventually we can expand out comfort zone and overcome crippling fears.  \n  One of the stupid things I've done that could be potentially dangerous and I do NOT recommend.  I had some milk thst set in the back of the fridge too long and turned itself into cheese curds floating in a Lactic acid vinegar type solution that was once whey.  And the curds smelled like parmesan and Asiago cheese. Well... it to my a while.  But I was able to overcome a fear and surprisingly didn't have any ill effects.   But I do NOT recommend it.lol",

The reasons leafy greens are often the cause for food poisoning is:\n\n1. At the commercial level your irrigation and fertilization is so quickly applied and widespread that it\u2019s easy for runoff to contaminate it. At home, you have tighter control over your water supply and anything else you put on your crops. And hopefully you\u2019ll know whether you\u2019re downstream from your pigs or cows\u2026\n\n2. Lettuce like romaine is often the culprit because the leaves are tightly packed, so contamination from bird poop/animal poop can get inside and is easily missed in harvesting and post processing. At home, you personally get a visual on everything you harvest. You\u2019ll see if there\u2019s literal crap on your food, and you won\u2019t eat it. \n\n3. Here\u2019s the kicker. We can let contaminated food go to market, but it can still be rendered safe to eat if the consumer examines and throughly washes it before eating OR if it is cooked first, killing pathogens. E. coli outbreaks almost always emerge at restaurants via food consumed raw (eg. romaine lettuce). The reason is that the restaurant staff isn\u2019t properly washing the lettuce and then serving it on a wide scale. Literally if the lettuce was properly washed, it would\u2019ve been safe to eat. Even then, not all who eat it get sick. At home, consumers almost always wash and cook their food carefully before eating it, thus the chances of food borne illness from commercially grown raw vegetables at home is extremely low.\n\nThink about all these steps that you have full control over at home that you don\u2019t at a commercial level. If you just wash, properly cook and store your food, you\u2019re practically guaranteed to never get sick from it. If you\u2019re really afraid, only eat cooked food. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f But the average home grower/home cook has nothing to fear. It\u2019s incompetent restaurant workers serving bougie salads that are really the frontlines of these outbreaks.",

Natural fertilizers, organic non-toxic pesticides, and very close tending of my plants, daily helped a lot. I also learned to dehydrate and pressure cook, both of which change the shape, form, and appearance of the food, and make usable in differing ways that make it more appealing.\n\nIt took me awhile to make the change, but I went from horrifically expensive store bought foods that often made me sick, to growing my own food and feeling healthier than ever. I lost my gall bladder around 2014, became allergic to 95% of foods and preservatives and other food related preservative and pesticide chemicals, and had to purchase organic food of very limited types. Once I began growing my own food and cutting out all of the toxins and whatever else is in grocery store bought foods, my diet became more diverse and healthier, and I became healthier, stronger, and more active.\n\nYou could say my situation forced me to make the mental changes necessary to appreciate and love growing, nurturing, and eating my own food, no matter how different or \u201cless than\u201d it may seem compared to the grocery store stuff\u2026 it gave me a lot of life back that I had lost due to illness, allergies, and nutrient loss from food not eaten \u201cstraight from the vine\u201d in my own garden all the time. Best wishes to you in becoming able to truly enjoy all the time and work and care you put into growing your own food! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd8b",

It also depends on if the foods are raw or cooked, and how they are cooked, as to whether I can consume them. I still have to use digestive enzymes on a regular basis and stay away from high fat/cream food. I was doing quite well until I got a flair up of everything due to a bad case of CV19 in July 2022 and developed long hauler\u2019s, or reactivated my ME/CFS &amp; RA, or all of the above. I went back to a very restricted diet for about six months and am doing much better and re-expanding my diet again. If I eat a wide of variety of food in small amounts, avoid allergens, and take prebiotics/probiotics/digestive enzymes I do pretty darn well given my circumstances.\n\nThe research I did after the gall bladder removal drastically changed my life said that 1% of individuals who have a cholecystectomy do experience this drastic after effect in developing severe dietary allergy issues and sensitivities. My sibling did not have this reaction\u2026 just a few months of having to avoid fatty foods, but now she deals with IBSD, which I have dealt with since my early teen years. Lots of co-morbid issues involved with that, so I have always had to be careful about my diet - it just got 10x worse after the cholecystectomy. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd8b",

I did almost a year of fresh smoothies with the few types of fruits and a green veggie nutrient powder mixed in, with digestive enzymes prior to drinking. It included digestive tract healing ingredients, like fresh turmeric, ginger, ground flax seed, coconut oil, raw honey, pumpkin seeds, and beet root. Every chopped up small, frozen, used coconut milk and coconut water, blended it into a smoothie with ice so that my digestive system did not have to work so hard to break down the foods.\n\nMy digestive track was so damaged by the gall bladder issue (5-7 years I had been seeking help and was down to rice, potatoes, and toast as my diet; they kept blaming my symptoms on a back injury and nerve damage) that I couldn\u2019t eat hardly anything. I use a daily multivitamin and multimineral, along with vitD3-K2, and a few other things now, but after pampering my digestive system for a year, I was able to slowly increase my nutrient intake. I still have to be careful, but have been pleasantly surprised by being able to eat things I grow that I\u2019d store bought make me sick. The only thing I can figure is that I do all organic growing, non-toxic pest control, and the foods are nutrient dense.  The things in the grocery store that are allowed to marked as healthy, or natural, or organic or whatever else still do not seem to be healthy, nutrient dense, and optimal for the microbiome.\n\nBest wishes to you in being able to expand your dietary intake to some extent over time. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd8b",

I\u2019m not sure I have ever had a pancreatic test. But I have had stomach biopsy and I don\u2019t produce enzymes to break down sugars, hence only able to tolerate starches.\n\nWas placed on a FODMAP diet and could not reintroduce anything without symptoms.\n\nConsequently seen many dieticians/nutritionists/gastroenterologists in a bid to gain additional foods and each time was told to remove more foods until the circumstance I am currently in.\n\nI questioned if taking dietary enzymes would help me but was told no without explanation - only that the lack of enzymes was genetic (no genetic panel done to prove it).\n\nI have been diagnosed with Ehelers Danlos Syndrome, MCAS, Fibromyalgia etc etc etc.\n\nIf I smell ginger I will break out in hives so the chemical reactions are not just when eating. Salicylate intolerance is so severe that I become ill from scented products such as peppermint, eucalyptus, tea tree, pine etc. real pine Christmas trees make me sick just having them in the house.\n\nI could tolerate beetroot, cabbage, pears chemical-wise but eating even a small/moderate amount such as one small pear created intense pain because of inability to digest the sugars.\n\nI am also allergic to grasses, tree pollens, bees and honey, dust mites and some medications.\n\nIf I could tolerate digestive enzymes perhaps I can eat pears and beetroot and some other things that don\u2019t have salicylates. I really miss chicken, eggs, butter and cheese too!",

I prefer mine blue rare.  But have no aversion to raw with a little seasoning.  It's also easier for your body to break it down and use it the closer to raw that it is.  The protiens and everything change when it cooks and it's a little more difficult on the body to break it down and assimilate it.",

Much like a package of hotdogs. You KNOW what a hotdog is made of, but you can ignore it because you aren't there to see it being made.  You only see the pristine sausage in its bright and shiny package.\n\nAs a food grower, you are now privy to the dirt and bugs and guts and blood of it all and you are having difficulty separating that from the finished product. You will get over it in time though.  We are super great at desensitization especially in terms of basic survival.  You're also correct, your food is better than the supermarket stuff. It's grown more ethically and humanely.  You're just closer to it than you're used to being to your food. It'll pass.",

It's not about scary gross things, it's about the resources it takes for non-local food to get to your table, as well as the nutrition difference. It's staggering. And quite well written! As all of her books are. I wish it were required reading for all of America. \n\nOn another note, I'm an avid canner, but know several people who just started canning that are afraid to eat what they've canned. I had to literally pep talk a woman I know into eating a can of peaches we canned together last fall.\n\nI was just thinking yesterday, while putting in my third potatoes patch.... \"I wonder how much money my potatoes would cost if I factored in my time and paid myself a living wage.... much cheaper to buy from the store (chuckle).\" But I know a truth very deeply- that my food is absolutely priceless. As is the experience I've put in getting good at growing it, preserving it, canning it. I don't trust very many people to grow my food anymore- and have relationships with local farmers that I trust. We go to the tailgate market instead of the grocery store from April to November. Did you know the same organic foods in the grocery store that are imported can have up to 90% less nutritients than the same thing grown and picked fresh in your yard? Soil quality has everything to do with the micronutrients available in your food. If the soil is shit and the same 3 fertilizers are what has created your grocery store foods,  rather than complex and diverse healthy soil, than you are not getting the proper nutrition from your food. Que dis-ease and cavities. Almost all commercial growers use fertilizer rather than biodynamic soil.\n\nFood is medicine. Unless... it isn't.\n\n(Also, please read the book!!! You'll LOVE it.

Everybody was happy. Then they started going bad faster than they were getting eaten so we decided to make pies. Anyone who has pitted cherries knows where this is going. Every cherry has a worm. A cherry colored, cherry flavored, tiny worm. I had been chowing down on worms for days.

Sometimes, I still bring it in and wash it out of habit but knowing how and where the food is grown is wonderful.",

They have to keep everything fully stocked or people stop buying, the last few bunches of spinach won\u2019t sell even if they are perfectly fine.

            "comment": "Here's what I do, mind you I have OCD that makes me probably a lot more overly concerned with cleanliness than others. A 3ft high 1/4\" mesh fence around the garden and buried about 3 inches in the dirt all around the garden to keep snakes and all manners of varmints out. Then I have raised beds, which helps with some of the burrowing critters but not perfect. Then on the fruiting plants I put shade cloth on the trellises for certain fruits and vegetables that only produce when temps are lower than we're having now, which reduces some of the opportunistic feeders. You will have to go out every day and pollinate certain plants by hand, such as tomatoes, but that's hardly a chore. For my fruit trees, after the blossoms have set, I wrap them loosely in a muslin cloth looking fabric that moves and then tie it kind of tight around the trunk. The fabric needs to be tight enough not to flap much at all when/should you have a storm. Once the \"walled garden\" is created, I still wash my vegetables. I had to do A LOT less inspection of the foods when made all those adjustments. \n\nGrowing up we had a setup very much like what I described above and I used to go out in the garden first thing in the morning, in only my undies, picking vegetables and fruit. I'd get to the end of the row and pick the strawberries, which were in an elevated bed and just brush some light dirt off and eat a few. I wouldn't do that today, but with the walled garden that I have again now, the only things that get on the food are rain, sunshine, and an occasional bug/bird poop. \n\nThe final step, wash thoroughly. I just use a hand soap that's free of dyes and perfumes. No need to go nuts, but you clean like you're about to eat it.",

I brought in a beautiful head of lettuce, washed it thoroughly, started to make a salad, and still found a big slug on it- even after washing it leaf by leaf! I just tossed the whole thing I was too grossed out. It made me decide not to grow my own lettuce. There\u2019s plenty of stuff we grow that I don\u2019t worry about, I\u2019ll stick to our root and vine veggies. Slugs are a no go for me.",

Something about getting them back cut up and in a ziploc bag reminded me of the specimens we would dissect in high school biology, and I started involuntarily imagining the smell of formaldehyde, and honestly, no matter how I cooked the rabbit, I gagged when I tried to eat it. Had a doe one day suffering with a horrible prolapse, and I had to put her down. She had been a great mom, and she was a beautiful, well-built rabbit, and it suddenly struck me how horrible it would be to waste the meat she was leaving behind. I butchered her and made rabbit pot pie, and for the first time, I could eat and enjoy our own rabbit. It was so strange, but that mental block just disappeared. I hope the same thing will happen for you!",

It's tough to get over the initial thought of inch worms but I can convince myself that even if I accidentally ate an inchworm, it will give me zero harm. The alternative is  to deliberately eating poison (pesticides) that is almost certainly bad for me or unnatural genetically modified food that will maybe harm me.  \n\nThe alternative becomes and even worse thought when I consider this same situation except it's my young kids eating the food.",

They from seeds, seeds you cared for an nurtered on your own. You know what chemicals touched those plants if any, you know what fertilizer and fed them. Same with your birds, you know what they ate and what was turned into the muscles you\u2019re about to devour. How many things in your life can you say are yours and yours alone, no other hand has had a second of their time. Just yours.

I have some chicks that look exactly like that (RIR crossed with some Wyandotte, some Isa brown), and I got some roos and some hens in each color (red vs the white/red). Golden comet/red star is the typical name for this kind of cross.\n\nI usually judge by the wattles and the tail feathers, and I'd say you have two hens. At that size, though, you should know for sure in a week or two (the roos will start crowing, the hens will start laying).",

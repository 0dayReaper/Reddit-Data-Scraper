He would go into the house and put my order in the fridge while I at work (very common in my area in the country) . After about 4 years I was home when he came and we were chatting when he told me he was terrified of birds.. For years this poor man braved my flock (50ish) of very social free range chickens, and my house that had cocktails, budgies, zebra finches, and society finches that sometimes flew free. I had no idea and felt terrible. I made sure to try and Remeber to pen all the birds on Mondays.",

If you sometimes have signal, or other people seem to get 4g in that area but you don't, that's the answer.\n\n If you don't have 4g coverage at all where you are, a femtocell is a better option. It's a little device that looks like another router that will broadcast its own 4G. It plugs into your internet to get that signal back to civilization, such as it is.",

After spending the morning painting with her, we were talking about doing it again, and I went and took a sip of my coffee... a moth had flown into the straw and was now IN MY MOUTH, trying to fly around. I panicked, still trying to be respectful, and tried to swallow the thing. It hit the back of my throat, still flying, and triggered my gag reflex and I spit iced coffee and moth all over her floor. I felt sooo bad. I never went back.",

            "comment": "I mostly frequent this sub because living this kind of life is my dream, but I actually have a story.\n\nMy office has a series of large decorative planters outside the doors.  These suckers are probably 3-4 feet across and about as tall.  For whatever reason, things rarely get planted in them, so they're basically just big concrete buckets of dirt.\n\nFor several years running, we had a mating pair of deeply misguided Canadian geese decide the one nearest the door was the perfect place to nest.  Geese are also extremely territorial about their nesting sites.\n\nSo all spring, we'd have to run a gauntlet.  Dad goose would sit on the pavement, while momma goose sat on her nest, both of them with heads swiveling for the first sign of a threat.  As I approached, their beady eyes would fix on me with laser focus.  Dad raised his head and hissed a warning.  Unfortunately for us both, I didn't have other options.  I'd give him as wide a berth as possible, and usually the worst would be he'd stand and puff up, hissing and honking.  But sometimes, maybe just to prove a point, he'd chase me to the door.  \n\nMaybe also relevant that I saw this dude, on multiple occasions, making aggressive threat displays and attempting to attack his own reflection in a mirrored window.  Even by geese standards, these two weren't bright.\n\nI kind of loved our geese neighbors.  Most of my coworkers were less amused.  But it was a more-or-less stable situation until two dumbasses were outside on a cigarette break.  These are the kind of guys who would eat a cockroach on a dare.  So one of them starts goading the other to confront Dad Goose.  \n\nWell, Dad Goose ended up chasing his tail all over the parking lot, wings thrashing, honking like a thing possessed.  IMO my coworker got what he deserved.\n\nBut the company decided the geese had become a liability, and took more aggressive measures to remove them, including installing something in the planter to keep them away.  I haven't seen them since.",

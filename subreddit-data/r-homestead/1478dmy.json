    "postText": "* I have baby bush bean plants in grow bags in the garden next to a raised bed with two small rows of nearly mature garlic. The plants are about an arm's length apart - they are not touching. Is it enough distance apart? Also, how big does the grow bag need to be to support 2 bush bean plants? The two stems are smaller than a hand's width apart. I think they might be too close. How can I help them? A final question: Some of the beans were repotted deep. Should I add more soil and hill them up?\n\n* I have container lettuce. Why does my romaine grow sideways and drags its own leaves across the soil. Some of them are erect, others are smeared. I have them in grow bags on a covered patio deck. They get enough sun, water, look healthy otherwise, and aren't bolted. What's with the sideways growth?",

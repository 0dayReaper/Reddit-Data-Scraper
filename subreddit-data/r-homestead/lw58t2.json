There are a ton of local influences on windspeeds, it really can be a microclimate. Looking around on Amazon they can go for $160 or so with some bells and whistles. Think of it just the same as tracking your annual power consumption.       \n\nYour energy usage is concerning. I'd really focus on bringing that waaaay down before trying to build a battery bank large enough. Keep in mind that the batteries will need to be kept warm too, lipo is best around 73F and won't charge at or below freezing. That's a lot of lost volume inside your heated area.     \n\nWith 2ish peak sun hours a day, I'd suggest looking to wind or water to generate juice before PV. I'm not saying it can't be done, but I'm at 5.3 hrs/ day and i'm not terribly impressed with the Generation projections of pure solar.      \n\nDo you have running water on property you could put a waterwheel and generator on?",

Looking at an outdoor wood boiler (I live in a forest) hopefully would knock that heating bill down to almost 0 and make my peak day 55kwh instead of 155kwh.\n\nIt's a fairly newer 4400sqft house and the shop is another 3000sqft so heating that with electric isnt great. The geothermal system is supposed to be the most efficient way of heating your house but it's basically running a 3kw compressor 24x7 on the coldest of days.\n\nE: didn't realize the batteries needed to be at 73f, definitely will be in be in the house and not the shop or garage then. Which means running a 3/0 cable around 600ft and at $20/ft that's a spicy cable!",

So will you buy a crapload of +/- 5ah batteries or can you get them bigger?  Will the charge controller bring them up to 4.2v or stop sooner to avoid long term \"charged\" state degrading the cells?  Will the charge controller balance all the cells?  I have PV solar too, so I'm genuinely curious how this would work.  Won't the batteries need replacing after around 300 cycles?",

I'll cut a piece of wood until there's only shavings left. And those get composted. My wife is a fiend for finding mistinted paint at the box stores that fit our outbuilding color scheme. Nothing quite like scoring a 60$ bucket of matching paint for 5-9$.     \n\nUsed 270w solar panels can be had on Ebay for about 12c/watt. The optimizers (26$ ea instead of 80$) and LiPo cells (4 lots of 4 cells at 470$ ea) will come from china via Aliexpress.

However as a reloader it's less about stockpiling and more about saving money on Hazmat and shipping fees when buying primers and powder.\n\nRegardless of how much powder you're buying whether it's 1 lb or 40 you have to pay a shipping fee which is usually $32 to $40 and you need to pay a Hazmat fee of $35. Reloaders - if given the opportunity - will purchase as much gunpowder as they can in a single purchase to save on the shipping and Hazmat fees.\n\nThe same goes for primers as well.  A lot of bullet manufacturers will sell cases of bullets that are just under the USPS maximum weight for a flat rate box. This is in the 2500 to 3500 quantity.  I did not consider myself a stockpiler, but when I was reloading it was not uncommon for me to have 12000 primers and 40 or 50 lb of gunpowder as well as 15 thousand or so bullets because of the different calibers and the quantities I would buy in.\n\nIt just was a result of using an Excel spreadsheet to be able to shoot for the least amount of money.  Even when times were great and there were no supply chain disruptions, that was kind of a normal amount for me to have just because I would buy in large quantities to distribute the shipping and hazmat fees. .",

A week or so later they still had some so I got a couple more. And so on and so on until there was very little left and it was really marked down so a bought several more boxes. Now I've still got 1000-1500 rounds of each which isn't a TON but I'm not out of ammo.\n\nStill, I bought a reloader and I'm working on finding supplies to learn to do so the next time this bullshit happens, I won't have to hope I was lucky enough to already have a bit of a cushion.",

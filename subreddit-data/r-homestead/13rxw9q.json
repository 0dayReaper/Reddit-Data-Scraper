An old carpenter working with us told us that they used to load a year's work of manure from the horse barn under the houses for insulation and a bit of composting warmth.  Do the dirt I dug out was 200 year old manure. \n\nThis was back around 1975.  The carpenter was in his 80's, and he knew his stuff.",

Essentially you keep the environment the right way, and the poop breaks down and *literally* gets hot/warm enough to keep the coop not freezing in winter. Little or no smell if done properly. And horse poop is way less stinky than chicken poop lol",

I left a note describing who we were as a family, what the current events globally and locally were. I also included a copy of my latest online grocery shopping and the local weekly newspaper. I wrapped it all in heavy duty plastic with a few silicon bags to help with moisture, though it was pretty dry. And a big piece of tape on the outside saying not to throw out without opening first lol\n\nI did it because the scraps of newspaper we found from the 70s were fascinating to read. Different salaries listed for men and women for the same job. Houses for sale for less than a tenth of what they are now, it was really interesting to find. Give the next people the same fun find!",

In the hands of a single family. In the 1960's the man that lived in this house started selling property in lots of 30 or 40 acres.  My dad started going there as a child and envisioned building a home there. \n\n In the late 90's the man sold the last adjacent 8 or 10 acres of available property to my dad.  When the old man died about 5 years ago, his daughter lived there until about 1.5 years ago and when she left she sold my dad the rest of it.  We have a total of 22 acres, including the original homestead with this cabin.  My dad told us about 3 months ago he'd like to have us restore and live there.",

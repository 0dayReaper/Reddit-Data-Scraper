    "postText": "Anybody have experience with an automatic garden watering. We are going out of town for a week and I am looking to set up the garden to water automatically. It\u2019s currently has soaker hoses hooked up to a hose bib and I turn it on for about 2 hours every morning. I am looking for a device that goes between the hose bib and hose to do this automatically. There is a plethora of options on Amazon and was hoping someone could give me a recommendation or share some experience. Thanks!",

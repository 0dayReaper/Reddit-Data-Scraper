            "comment": "To say it has been an interesting year at the farm is an understatement. Our operation has never been more efficient thanks to the last few years of infrastructure development and the full implementation of the systems we learned during our formalized training in the many years prior to restoring this property to production. \r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately, many extreme weather scenarios have occurred in very untimely fashion from the very beginning of the year until now, and relief does not look likely for the first part of this season. \r  \n\r  \nStarting in early spring we had extended periods of temperature above 90 degrees. The plants we start early on are typically cold hardy and thrive in temperatures between 40-70 degrees. This was very stressful for some of the plants but we made it through with minimal losses, having to reseed a few varieties that got scorched or stunted.\r  \n\r  \nSince then, we have had only 1 rain storm for the duration of the spring and it was a severe flood. We had between 5 and 7 inches of rain come down within 24 hours. For reference, the ideal amount of rain is about 1 inch per week. So we had a month or a month and half worth of rain in one day.\r  \n\r  \nThis threatened our entire potato planting, but we were able to save almost all of them by quickly digging some swales through the field.\r  \n\r  \nThankfully our fields are (mostly) oriented to avoid pooling of water and extreme saturation. We also waited to seed our root-crops (carrots, beets etc) which benefited us greatly because all the seeds would have washed away. So, we made it through that event fairly well given the severity of the rain.\r  \n\r  \nWe have not had any rain since that storm, and none before it but we have been irrigating between 300-900 gallons of water every few days directly onto the crops to keep them going. \r  \n\r  \nWe even installed a full irrigation system which we have never needed until this year. I put layflat house to supply water to the fields and ran header tubes down the length of them so we could pull drip lines down the beds. This has been working well so far. \r  \n\r  \nThankfully, our soil has a high capacity for water retention and we are in the creek bed, so water is constantly moving through our property. This is beneficial in times like these but we are getting desperate for rain. \r  \n\r  \nThis leads us to the most recent, unexpected and extreme weather event we have faced so far in the short season. A frost in mid May.  This is a very unlikely event, especially this late into May given that our last frost date is somewhere between April 21 and May 4th depending on what zoning map you use. \r  \n\r  \nWe had just planted out our first cucumbers, squash, zucchini and eggplants and thankfully did not plant any tomatoes, melons, or other summer items. We were able to cover almost everything in the fields but we lost a tremendous amount of cucumbers and squash. \r  \n\r  \nLots of our spring crops were damaged as well, which is surprising because they are hardier crops. Our potatoes also took major damage. They are mostly alive but will likely be set back at least two to three weeks.\r  \n\r  \nIt seems like a bad movie where someone just picked the unlikely things to happen and stacked them all in a row:\r  \n\r  \nExtreme heat when it is supposed to be cold\r  \nDrought\r  \nFlood\r  \nDrought\r  \nExtreme cold when it is supposed to be hot\r  \nDrought\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope everyone else has had a better start to the season so far.. let me know how it has been going!\n\n\r  \nIf you want to see the video of how we installed the irrigation with some commentary and tips then check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luZdJw46izc",

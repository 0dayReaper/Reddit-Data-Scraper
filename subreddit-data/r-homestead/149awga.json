            "comment": "I would get the water tested on my own at the source I intend to draw from within maybe a 30 foot radius.  Water quality and pollutants can be localized.  Testing a stream 1 or 2 miles from where you intend to draw from is meaningless to you, especially if you are upstream from where it was tested.  Best way to purify water is to mimic commercial water purification.  Get a 55 gallon drum and mix some homemade hardwood charcoal, don\u2019t use any accelerants when making it, and place it at the bottoms of your drum, then place about 12 inches of sand keeping about half of the drum empty.  Have your water source slowly trickle and fill the remaining part of the drum, have a tap at the bottom that leads to your storage tank. This is a first line purification, you would then need to treat for bacteria and other organisms through boiling or chemical treatment.  \n\nHonestly it\u2019s sometimes much less of a hassle if you bite the bullet and drill a well, where bacteria and other organisms are usually not an issue.  If you have creeks and streams on your land, potable drinking water should not require a deep expensive well.  Good luck.",

They're super useful and I know it was \"food safe\" at least. \n\nI do believe there is a huge untapped market for large food-safe containers. The buckets get tossed with all the other garbage. The containers could be revenue rather than expense. I've seen it. \n\nThe most successful bakery I've ever worked sold the containers and lids. $1 each. One set was $2. Super nominal amount, but it was great to gain rather than lose.  We have these buckets people want.... Hmmm let's charge a nominal amount for running them though the wash rather than use dumpster space at a net negative. \n\nJust not priority under capitalism. \n\nIt's faster to just toss in the dumpster than set aside or wash and dry for reuse.\n\nDon't use plastics of unknown origin, please.",

This IS the most logical approach. \n\nLabels are used to impart additional information as needed such as contents, precautions, handling, shipping, etc. There are several coordinated labeling systems: general label from manufacturer, NFPA diamond, DOT safety labels, international safety shipping labels. \n\nImposing additional coding requirements primarily to benefit secondary users of single use drums does not make sense. If you really want to know what was in a drum then buy new virgin drums -- not waste used containers. There is a reason that states like California specify that ISO (conex) containers used in residential architecture MUST be either new or single use. \n\nDrums are widely reused and if there is a rigid color coding scheme this would interfere with that practice. (I used to work as a textiles chemist and the bleach for wet processing was always delivered in used drums.) You cannot disrupt a whole industry just so that you can have a source of drums that meet your needs in the used market. \n\nIf your need is that critical then buy new. If you want drums that have never been used for pesticides, herbicides, radioactive waste, hazardous waste storage or shipment, etc. then find a source that you trust or look to Uline. \n\n'Wouldn't it be nice if . . . ' needs numbers to justify it showing that what we have doesn't work adequately and the proposed solution is the most cost effective solution to resolve the issue. Until then most drums in the used market will be blue. \n\nNow will your proposal really increase safety? Let's see the numbers. \n\nIn God we trust. All others bring data. -- W. Edwards Deming",

Unless your plastic goods are specifically labeled as BPA free they likely contain BPA. Your daily dump out should dramatically reduce BPA and any other leachate in the water from the drum. Is there a problem? Only if you are having a problem. (Low sperm count in bulls or difficulty conceiving in heifers.) The realistic goal is not to eliminate, but to control chemical issues. Do not get so fixated on one thing that in attempting to address it you create more and worse problems for yourself. We live in an imperfect world -- get used to it! (Steel drums rust in water, galvanized is toxic if the water is acidic, stainless is expensive, blah, blah, blah.) Key word here is compromise: make choices that you can live with. (BTW speaking of grain: It is standard industry practice to spray fields of wheat, oats, barley, rye, etc. with glyphosate to make the heads of grain dry to a predictable level before harvest. So practically all of the grain out there is contaminated with glyphosate. The alternative is more crop failures (expense) and more moldy grain.)",

Metal barrels normally arnt food grade stuff. But obviously there is always an exception. \n\nMe personally? I'd add water to them for a week, rinse and repeat for no joke a month or 2, then I would feel comfortable storing rain water in them. \n\nBut I'm just a mid 30s dumb farmer, and nobody listens to us anyway.",

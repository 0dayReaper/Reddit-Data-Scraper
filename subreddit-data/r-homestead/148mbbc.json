    "postText": "I was on vacation mid May for two weeks and we had unusually warm weather. 28+ everyday for two weeks which we didn\u2019t expect and the person I hired only deeply watered them once in that two weeks. They looked fine when I got back other then a cherry that just completely died. Since then it has still not rained and I have made sure I watered deeply 2 times a week at least. Usually put the hose around the canopy for 5 minutes each time or two 5 gallon buckets out of our duck pond each watering. What am I doing wrong? Or is it just this unusual weather? I\u2019ve done the screw driver test and seem to have water so I\u2019m holding off until dry again. \n\nA little background, we bought this property 4 years ago and each year have had amazing fruit production every year. Last year it slowed down but still got a lot, this year only about 3 of our 8 apple trees produced fruit. Every spring we compost, mulch, and prune suckers/diseased branches. The only thing we\u2019ve been doing different is watering fruit trees out of the duck pond. It\u2019s very diluted compost tea and didn\u2019t think this would be an issue but now feel worried. Another issue I think it could be is weather, we had snow on April 12 and freezing temperatures and then a heat wave not even a month later. Can anyone give me tips/advice on what I could be doing wrong or what I should do from here on out. Thanks everyone",

All the flowers fell off and none of the trees fruited at all. This year we had a really late frost just when everything was in flower.  All the flowers fell off and there\u2019s maybe 10% of the normal fruit. Also pretty sure half of my baby walnut trees died, their leaves (which were only just emerging when the frost hit) shriveled and died and they haven\u2019t resprouted yet. \n\nSucks when there\u2019s nothing you can do because Mother Nature just decided you\u2019re not getting fruit this year.",

It\u2019s just odd everything seemed fine about two weeks ago and now are just slowly starting to wilt :( I\u2019ll try not to stress this year and just hope for fruit next year! Thanks for the response :)",

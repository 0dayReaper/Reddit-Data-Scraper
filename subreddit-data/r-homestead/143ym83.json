How many posts are on here lately with people either recommending or actually relocating wildlife?\n\nIt is almost guaranteed to be illegal.\n\nIt can spread diseases that will impact the population where you dropped it off.\n\nIt is likely a death sentence anyway, only much slower than a bullet.  Biologists have a had time relocating animals and having them survive.  What makes you think you can do it?\n\nEither learn to avoid or to live with the problems the wildlife cause, or learn to live with killing them yourself.\n\nJust stop doing it or telling others to do it.",

Have used this method to get animals out from porches/foundations/sheds and it\u2019s usually pretty darn effective. Critters generally like dark and quiet so if you take those qualities away they tend to relocate themselves.",

If you're on a road, there's neighbors somewhere.  Don't make your problem wildlife into their problem, too.  Way too many people drive down to the dead end of my road and say \"Oh, guess I'm miles and miles from the nearest residence! I'll drop my captured wildlife/unwanted housecat here\", not realizing that there's a dozen houses within a half mile, just not attached to this dead end road (or not visible from the road).",

They always have some and typically don\u2019t manage at all, unless clear illness or whatever. But this one summer they had so many it was visible - they were messing with the farm dog, pulling down the suet, and getting under the garden fence. They caught 20! And yeah they didn\u2019t relocate them\u2026 years later a new friend came over and said \u201chey I knew this area was familiar! We relocated raccoons that were in our garage into that \u2018preserve\u2019 across the street a few years back!\u201d Just a slightly slower demise for sure.",

He would never come home empty handed and I think his one day best was 13, but he was out dusk til dawn to do that and our dog slept like a log the whole next day. Fond memories of hauling ass in the dark following the dog's signals when he found a scent, followed the trail, and got them up a tree. If he caught them on the ground he would snap their necks and not damage the pelt.\n\nRacoons are intelligent and adaptable, they can survive relocation without any problems. They are a huge nuisance to homesteading for sure.",

Look, those woods already have raccoons.  They're full.  There's just as many there as those woods can hold.  So what does your raccoon do?\n\nIt's still a problem, just not in the yard you keep your stuff in.  Either that raccoon dies alone or it gets into fights with other animals and dies, or it eats their food and wins the fight and one or more of the locals die.  Either way it's likely to spread disease.\n\nStop feeding them.  Fix your pets.  Stop planting invasive species and useless lawns.  Pick up your trash and reuse it recycle it.  Leave some land for them, and watch for deer and such when you drive.",

One night - fox got an entire hand fed and trained flock of chickens we raised and spread them all across the yard and a neighbor saw a fox with a chicken that morning and cut through his field to a barn next to his place. \nThe agent in contact found their den but no foxes. \nI\u2019ve caught and dispatched plenty of raccoons over the years. \n\nTransporting wildlife is hazardous to you and whoever place you drop them off to.

It doesn\u2019t even work, as the cat populations keep climbing. Every time I removed a group of cats from people\u2019s property (and found them all homes) no cats ever came back. TNR promotes the survival of colonies because it keeps attracting more cats to the site. Also, despite the BS feral cat people spew, the colonies are almost rarely healthy. 50+ cats on one property is a breeding ground for bad respiratory infections and fights that lead to wounds that can cause infections. Not to mention they use people\u2019s yards as their litter boxes. It\u2019s not healthy or humane for the cats, residents or environment to have outdoor feral cats. While there\u2019s no harm with a FEW fixed barn cats contained on one property, it becomes a problem when it grows to 10-15+. \n\nNo, they shouldn\u2019t all be killed either. The friendly cats and kittens (including the merely skittish ones) should be taken to rescues to find indoor only homes. Feral kittens young enough to be socialized should be socialized and found indoor homes. Some of the feral adults can be divided among barn homes, but people should only be allotted a few per property. The rest of the feral cats (usually the ones in the big colonies) should be humanely euthanized by a vet.",

They waste thousands of dollars that could be going towards friendly but shy cats and feral but able to be socialize  kittens shelters have no choice but to turn down. The true savable ones get screwed because TNR people insist on saving every feral cat. Imagine instead of TNR they would do more due diligence at weeding out the savable ones (groups near me literally promote putting 3 month old kittens and friendly adults back because they don\u2019t have the resources to care for them).",

One the neighbors dog killed ( live rural, 4 houses within reasonable distance, only one dog leashed), we're friends, a couple beers later and we decided a paintball gun was the best course of action.  My 6 year old is diligent lol  \n\n\nFriday night we lost two more.  It was our fault, we have them in a dog house, sitting under an ez up with chicken wire around it.  This method has worked for 3 years raising baby chicks, so Saturday I evening I moved the remaining three into the big chicken house that's a few hundred yards from the house, and extremely secure.  I set out two traps.\n\nA mama raccoon with 4 kits were waiting Sunday morning.  She's doing what she's supposed to do, feeding the kids.  It's not a wild animals fault for being a wild animal, same as the deer that mowed my garden in May when I left the gate open to the garden.  Went to the edge of the yard and released them back to the woods.  \n\n\nI should have been more diligent on flock protection.",

He is a very gentle man and doesn't have the heart to kill pests (we don't use chemical fertilizers or anything like that, strictly organic, same goes for our pest control) himself. We have those spring traps for gophers and mice, but those are hands-off except in freak occurrences when the animal gets trapped by a leg or something, and that's generally when they call me to handle it because they know I grew up raising and butchering livestock and I've got the stomach for it.  \n\n\nThe problem lies in the live traps set up for larger animals that are also pests, like ground squirrels, prairie dogs, rabbits, ect. Whenever something is caught in one of these traps, he doesn't have the heart to think of them dying, so he doesn't call me or even take them to wildlife control - he takes them to the local park and lets them go. I have told him so many times to look at the damage ground squirrels have caused at the park - they've literally made so many burrows around the bases of the trees that many trees that are hundreds of years old have fallen and had to be removed because there's nothing for their roots to hang onto anymore, there's thousands of the damn things - and he just shrugs and says there's already so many there, a few more can't make a difference, and just look at their cute little faces!  \n\n\nNo. So, so many times no. Either learn to live with them, or put an end to it. Don't make them someone else's problem. It's cruel to everyone involved, including the animals.",

They used some sort of tagging/ tracking devices on at least a dozen raccoons. (I forget the actual number.) The study subjects were then transported and released at specific distances (one mile, two miles, five miles, etc.) away from \"home\" (the territory/area where they were trapped/caught). The results surprised them. Only two didn't make it back \"home\"  because they were hit by vehicles. The rest all eventually returned to the original area where they were caught, with the longest distance travel being 26 miles. I never tried to look for the study, but it might be difficult to find since not all research is published in peer reviewed journals.",

Especially with species that have a very small home range like some turtles/tortoises. \n\nAlso ironically, you actually want a lot of the wildlife. Because the alternative is worse. In Australia they killed off most of the marsupial carnivores and now they\u2019re overrun with mice, rabbits, and camels. You *need* some wildlife unless you want your life to be 24/7 pest control. \n\nYes, it sucks to have to constantly outsmart varmints, but if you don\u2019t have predatory animals, you\u2019ll get mouse plagues. *Mouse plagues*. In no world would I prefer that to having to outsmart a fox. At least it\u2019s, like, a countable amount of fox. Not 1,000s of rodents. \n\nSimilarly, yes, you need to be careful about laws regarding wildlife. Especially with birds and reptiles. For mammals, there\u2019s often laws based around disease. Deer especially, but if you see a sickly/weird-behaving animal, *please* do not relocate it. Canine distemper is a wildfire for canids and raccoons. Then there\u2019s rabies and all else. Armadillos can have leprosy. Honestly, avoid contact with wildlife. If you must interact, limit your interactions as much as possible. Shooting a sickly animal spares others of a lot of suffering.",

But when you\u2019re releasing animals miles away with no instruction, it\u2019s bad news. When my neighbor had a allegedly-scary owl \u201cstuck\u201d on her porch, I called my mentor. Getting a fledgling barred owl safely to a tree was easy enough, but the legal liability is high for protected species. CYA is important. \n\nAlso sadly sometimes animals just die. Part of nature. Saving domestic ones is fine, since they rely on us, but the wild ones die to feed the scavengers. Sometimes trying to rehab is more cruel than the alternative (ex: baby cottontails, which usually die from panic). If it wasn\u2019t a human- or pet-caused issue, that\u2019s up to Nature to decide.",

Avoiding cross-contamination of weird wild germs and you or your animals is also important. Randomly dying wild birds? Contact local gov to report it and you help prevent poultry from getting sick too.",

BUT I knew he\u2019d come back again until he eats every single chicken. So I trapped him last night. I\u2019m vegetarian. I don\u2019t like killing animals. However, I also realize that relocating is cruel to the animal and just makes my problem someone else\u2019s problem. I wouldn\u2019t be very happy if someone dropped off a raccoon on my street, so why would I do that to someone else?",

I can see a handful of times to legitimately relocate one - but that\u2019s an exception and should never be the rule.  \n\nFish included in this too.  Disease, throwing off predator/prey ratios, possibly moving the animal outside its native habitat\u2026\n\nDispatching the animal is what is right - not relocation.   Laws here make relocation illegal.  It is against the law to move the animal to another location after trapping.  You must either dispatch or release where trapped.",

So yeah if you moved them to a cave, they may have infected that population or gotten infected and died.  Not to me ton the whole rabies thing.  Call a professional.  I would have done an exclusion device so that when they flew out they wouldn't get back in and they would have found a new spot themselves.  And not all bats live in caves.\n\nThe turtle is another bad example in that you moved him a short distance.  Weare talking about people that relocate animals miles away.\n\nYour bat example is exactly what I'm talking about here.  Relocating should only be done by trained people and not just anyone.",

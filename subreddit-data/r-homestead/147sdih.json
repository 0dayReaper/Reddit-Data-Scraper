    "postText": "I laid some grass clippings down in between the rows in the paths of the garden as a kind of mulch/covering, but I then noticed that the grass decomposes and smells a little nitrogen-y.  Would something like this be enough to give nitrogen burns to the plants?  Or would you need a lot of composting material right on the base of the plants?",

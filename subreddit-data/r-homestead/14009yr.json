However it may not be a nutritional as normal scraps for them, in addition you should check the if you used probiotics, I\u2019m not sure if the composting bacteria are safe for consumption.",

I think I\u2019ll also try feeding some dried compost to the chickens and see how it goes. I know avocados and potatoes are poisonous to chickens so I\u2019ll avoid that;)",

    "postText": "\n\n[Virginia, USA] My wife and I are under contract to buy 15 acres of undeveloped raw land. We\u2019ve just discovered that there\u2019s is a natural gas distribution line running across the property. The line have no recorded easement. We\u2019ve checked and so has the surveyor. Surveyor did a subdivision of the adjacent parcel in 2019 and notes the gas line on the subdivision plats graphically but they don\u2019t have any dimensions or easement widths because the easement doesn\u2019t exist. I\u2019m trying to get ahold of the gas company but they\u2019re not responsive at the moment. \n\nQuestion: Does anyone have experience with resolving unrecorded easements?  I\u2019d be happy if the utility company could verify depth and location and get a legit easement recorded. \n\nAt the moment my plan is to draw up a building plan showing a full depth basement excavation right on top of where I think the line is and start showing it to anyone at the gas company I can get ahold of to get their attention.",

I know they're a more general organization but they might have the connections to get people to answer the phones.\n\nFWIW, in our state, you don't legally have to call 811 before you excavate.  But if you call and they come out and give the all clear and you hit something, the cost of repair is on them.  If you never call and you hit something, repair falls on you.  So even having property in the middle of nowhere where no utilities are, we called 811 and made them come out, juuuuust to cover our asses.  The guy laughed but said it was nice to get a drive out to the country and admitted he may have worked a little slower than usual just to drink up some peace and quiet.  lol\n\n811 may also know the standard easements.  Planning and Zoning might also know the standard easements.  That doesn't mean you aren't working with an anomaly but it might give you a starting point.  Good luck!",

Supposedly is was \u201ca 4\u201d or 6\u201d steel pipe from the 1950s\u201d.  Off to talk to the neighbors I guess.",

From the sounds of it, it probably happened a loooooooooooooong time ago and possibly there was a paper trail before an electronic system but I\u2019m betting at this point the only people who would know are the people directly involved when it was installed",

    "postText": "Question:  is there some kind of unspoken rule about making noise at night?  I know from years of camping at campgrounds that 10pm is quiet hour.  I arrived on my newly purchased property at about 9:30p.  I had a lot unloading to do.  It was a very still, quite, gorgeous night.  I was so pleased that I couldn\u2019t see any of my neighbors lights.  But seems like my shutting of vehicle doors, screen doors, and RV stairs extending noises pissed off a neighbor.  I was also moving vehicles around. I was walking out the house door when seems like someone yelled, \u201cTrying to get sleep, man\u201d or \u201cGo to sleep, man\u201d.  I was so startled - I thought there must be a squatter in an outhouse on my property, but there was no squatter.  I think it was a neighbor at least 5 acres away\u2026is that even possible?  Did I not get the memo?  I wasn\u2019t amplifying music.  It was almost 11p.  Or do I have a crazy neighbor?",

            "comment": "5 acres really isn't very far in the country. But that's a head's up that *said neighbor* will put you on notice for stuff you might not be aware of. I would send over something fresh baked, or a box of good candy. Everyone loves goodies, some not alcohol. Anyway, put a note on it with an simple apology for disturbing them. While it's all new &amp; exciting to you, the neighbor is wondering what kind of people moved in next door. It never hurts to do a little extra when settling into your homestead. That neighbor could know the lay of the land, be a great resource, or be a jerk. But you're likely to find that out fairly quickly. Also, many folks in 'homesteading country' rise early, have long commutes, or work really long days. Some hit the sack early and rise before daylight all yr round. But for sure have fun and good luck.",

            "comment": "When there's less \"city noise\" sound seems to travel farther.\n\nOur nearest neighbors are about a mile away.  We can hear their rooster in the morning, their dogs barking, their ATV if they're riding, their music on a saturday night when they're letting loose.  None of it is necessarily intrusive.  But we can definitely hear it.  And if it were 2am and they had that music blasting I'd have a different reaction to when they do it at 8pm or noon.\n\nYou could always drop off a note that's something like \"Sorry for the noise the other night, I didn't realize how much the sound from my property travels to yours.  Wanna come by for a beer some time and you can catch me up on anything else a new neighbor might want or need to know?\"\n\nYou may have been louder than you realized because you thought no one could hear.  He may have just had a busy or important morning the next day.  You never know.\n\nBut most towns do have some kind of quiet hours.  Usually starting at 9 or 10pm if there's something in place.",

I could hear nothing inside the house.\n\nAll this to say, if your neighbor is 5 acres away and they are not only saying be quiet but are close enough to you to yell out, that's weird. If my neighbor called to me, I wouldn't be able to hear them unless they were already on my property.\n\nPut some cameras up. This is weird.",

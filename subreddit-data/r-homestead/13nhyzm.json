    "postText": "Hi fellow Homesteaders!  If I am in the wrong place to ask these questions, I humbly apologize and only ask if there is a subreddit for my questions. \n  Me and my son have been talking about building a Homestead in NH, so we can move all our kids and close family together, so we can all contribute and make it succesful and something we can pass to our generations and hopefully keep our family united during such crazy times.  \n  The issue is how quickly properties are being grabbed. We didn't realize how crazy the market is.  As soon as we think we   something that fits our needs for homesteading, its nabbed quicker than you can get there. We have been thru this 7 times already where we find something , get there, take a look, and by the time we even put the bid, it dissapears or (I guess) severely outbid, maybe.  Its starting to feel like its out of our reach. \n  I just wanted to ask you pros, how did you do it? How were you able to look, get boots on the ground, a term I hear alot, and get the property before its gone? What channels do you use to find properties? We use real estate agents, to keep everything legit, as we have heard of being swindled, and cant afford a tragedy like that. Are there better ways? \n  I see the wonderful achievements this community has and hope maybe someone can just point me in the right direction,  a clue, something that can make me and my families dream come true. Family is the most important thing in our lives and we all want to be united in this dream of being a Homestead family and community. Where we live is impossible as the laws make any kind of off grid or mass growing and especially having livestock illegal or impossible.  My son wants NH.  I think Maine is better, but as long as my family is all together, I dont care where.  Anyway, sorry for being so long, but am passionate about this dream,  as Im sure all of you when you were in my place. Thank you to all.",

            "comment": "Im a realtor in texas. Best i can say is, ask around and keep looking. Dont rush it, be patient. Call and ask property owners and ask their neighbors and just keep asking. Ask people at church, at work, grocery store. An off market deal might be your best bet.  Dont rush it. Dont buy emotionally. Also, in the meantime, find a good realtor that will keep sending you the public listings, but dont fomo buy. If you find one, good. But at least you'll start to get a better idea of the market. Pray and ask and take what is given.",

            "comment": "New England, in general is going to be a hard market.  States are small so people who only want to shop in one state are all competing for a limited number of parcels.  Then you add in that NE in general is just very crowded.  By that, I mean that you no sooner leave one metro area then you're already in a suburb of another.  That means that most rural properties tend to be in that perfect zone smack between two cities.  Which means you're competing with buyers from both metro areas, more than likely.  As opposed to somewhere out west where if I wanted rural land, I just have to drive far enough from a city to not be near anything.  I'm not then approaching another city, I'm approaching even more rural, remote land.\n\nI used [Landwatch.com](https://Landwatch.com) to find our property.  Still use it to see what's coming available in the area because you can still find some good deals and we have friends who *say* they'd like to buy some property out by us....though none of them ever bite when I send out good deals.  Not all realtors are good at raw land (if that's what you've been looking at).  So it might be worth talking to other agencies or doing a little shopping yourself.  Some don't seem quite as gifted at finding bare land as properties with structures on them.\n\nOffering less than asking in a competitive market might also be your issue.  It's possible you're getting out bid by offering asking or under.  We bought in 2015 before the covid land rush.  But now you're competing with people who have gone remote working and can live anywhere they want.  And with more and more properties being snatched up by corporations to turn homes from purchases to rentals, you have a lot of families that are buying up land to build a house rather than fighting for a home in a highly competitive market.\n\nAlso, not for nuthin but consider the short growing season in NH and ME.  You'll really need to be johnny on the spot with food production.  Especially for such a large group.  So I would spend this down time, waiting for the right property to look into methods that might expand your season.",

Perhaps by next year property will come back on the market. Recently I\u2019ve seen reduction in prices which hopefully continues. Don\u2019t rush the process 70% of farm land will change hands in the next 15 years. So many farmers are about to retire.",

The further north you go the more you can find, and at a cheaper rate. Nothing is cheap anymore. We got a super deal on 2 acres on a lake. Four years later neighbors house (which is identical) sold for 2.5x the price!",

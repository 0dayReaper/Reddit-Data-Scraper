    "postText": "Wasn\u2019t sure where to go for this but I figured plenty of people here would have experience. I\u2019m moving to a new rental with a small yard. I\u2019m planning on putting up a shade cloth for my indirect light plants. I need to tell my landlord how big the poles would be and how deep they\u2019d go. Does anybody have recommendations for some lightweight poles that won\u2019t have to go too deep? And how deep would they need to go to be secure during a storm? Any help and suggestions appreciated",

But I also have some 10ft T posts that I'll clip a solar sail to on still days (we get really bad winds so I can't leave it up all the time.)",

We do of course get afternoon storms, but they aren\u2019t anywhere close to hurricane winds. Do you think they\u2019d be ok for here? I\u2019m planning on going to Lowe\u2019s later to see my options for different poles. T posts seem good though as I\u2019d be able to get them in the ground easily, they\u2019re cheaper than more permanent shade cloth poles, and they\u2019re not too heavy. How deep would they need to go?\n\nAnd thank you for the suggestion!",

There's a flange on the bottom that you need to get below grade and you're done.  About a foot, maybe?\n\nI like the cattle panel arch just because I don't have to worry so much about it blowing away.  I really can't speak for how well it'll work on the T posts full time because where we are I have no choice but to take it down so I don't really know at what wind speeds it really starts to thrash.  I do plan to kind of test it one day just not quite there yet so I take it down any time the wind will be more than about 12-15 mph.  It depends on the direction it's coming from, how much movement that causes.  But I also don't have good turnbuckles or anything on it like you should because I know I'm going to be doing those \"oh shit storm coming\" quick detachments and I didn't want to have to fuss too much.\n\nYou'll also need to come up with a good attach point.  I got target hangers because I wanted to have some time to adjust it around and figure out what works best.  But something welded or drilled through would be much more reliable.",

I\u2019m not sure what everything you\u2019re talking about is, but I will do more research to figure that out and what my best move is here. Also have a very handy dad so I\u2019ll reach out to him lol. I\u2019ll head to tractor supply instead",

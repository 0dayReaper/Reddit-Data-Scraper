He will be more stable, wont wobble around as much, and perhaps most importantly he wants the axe to go between his legs if he happens to fall short in his swing. Eventually he will be tall enough to hit himself with his swing and you don't want him to axe his leg open when he does. I cut a lot of wood as a boy scout and I taught axe/knife safety at a scout camp. Honestly its great that your son likes to chop wood but his form is giving me anxiety. Spreading his feet is really important for safety. I also agree with u/counterweight7, if a round is too tall for him get a shorter round, even if it isn't that tall. You don't want your axe in the dirt like that.",

Make it an exciting chore :) We tease each other, it\u2019s a fun family time when we split.\nWe don\u2019t ask him to do it, and he doesn\u2019t have to stack the wood he splits. He has to put the maul back, and needs to wear shoes (yeah, I know... summer days are spent barefoot and I had to intervene once.)\nJust make it fun :) if your kid sees you looking forward to it, they\u2019ll want to do it too. And if not, that\u2019s fine too",

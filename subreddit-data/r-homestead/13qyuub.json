    "postText": "Was recommended here by a more prepping-focussed subreddit. I'm not a terribly active reddit user so sorry if I got any of the reddit etiquette wrong. I'm sure you see this type of question all the time but any advice would be really appreciated! Here goes:\n\nMy spouse and I are in our 20's and starting to plan for the future. My goal for a while has been to be at least partially self-sufficient and we've talked about it and she's very onside with this. We don't ever plan on being full-time homesteaders, but I want to make sure we can insulate ourselves from any major shock.\n\nOur first thoughts have been a property with room for a sizeable garden with enough raised beds to rotate 4-5 crops, some fruit trees and bushes, a well, and some sort of alternative power/heat source (solar, woodstove, etc). We've been looking around the half-acre mark in the rural area outside the city we both work in. Both of us are pretty handy, comfortable with DIY projects, and teaching ourselves new skills. We have a decent amount of gardening experience between us and have been growing a few raised beds since the start of the pandemic, but we're still working to improve our knowledge and learning as we go.\n\nFor anyone who's gone down this road, I'm curious what was important to you when buying your property: What worked, what didn't, and what are some things we might not have thought of?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional details if anyone wants it: We're hardiness zone 6b for planting. The area tends more towards clay-heavy soil. It's Canada so the housing market here is a bit overheated where we are and there's an element of \"work with what you got or can get\". We both have day jobs but have some flexibility in our work hours. I grew up in a smaller town and my spouse grew up rurally so we have a pretty good idea of what we're getting into here and trying to do this on a scale we can manage.",

This has been filled with far more failures and mistakes to date than successes, but it has been an incredibly rewarding learning experience that we have grown from. Each week I learn something new I did not know previously, both in terms of self awareness and skill sets,\n\nI can say that no matter how much prep work and research you do beforehand that shit is still going to end up going sideways. Rules of the game out here in the sticks. You adapt, you learn from others, and you work with the hand you are dealt. We are really blessed to have some awesome neighbors that have been wonderful in helping us out, but I have also self taught myself numerous seemingly impossible tasks via YouTube videos and research. You just need to have the balls to be OK with failure and trying again anyway. Nobody wakes up one morning and becomes a master of all of these skills. Even the FFA practically from birth kids that grew up around here had to start somewhere.\n\nI think the best piece of advice I can give is to start small. Don't hit the ground with this grand vision and look to execute everything all at once. One project, bring it to fruition, and then slowly add to your workflow. I also have a (remote) day job, so it takes time management and discipline to handle everything and not drive yourself nuts. Plus initially everything you do is going to take 10 times as long as you think it will. If this is a life you want you can 100% get there, and this sub is a treasure trove of knowledge, but it is also not for everyone. And thats cool too.",

Clay soil can be mastered with raised beds of compost. Wildlife can mostly be controlled with good fences. \n\nYou need a solid 8- 10 hours of direct sunlight for your garden. Do neighboring trees shade a garden spot. Which direction does the suns path take in the growing season etc. \n\nAs a lifelong country girl and gardener I always recommend starting smaller than you intend your finished garden size to be. Don't overwhelm yourselves right out of the gate fueled by sheer excitement. Learn to store and cook what you grow and grow what you will actually eat. As you learn your food wants and your gardens capabilities you also will learn the growing schedule in your micro climate.",

I don't have the most experience either, mind you, but our situations are pretty similar. You can do a lot with a half-acre! I have considerably more than that and managing this amount of land is an undertaking in itself. I am learning that your ambition is mostly your friend but can also be your foe.\n\nIt's great to have projects and new skills to learn, but those really add up while maintaining a full-time job. If a property comes with the type of outbuildings and/or infrastructure you want (like a barn, or a heat pump/wood fire place for the house), that's a huge bonus. The less you have to fix or build or imagine in order to go to the things you want, the better. There will still be a lot of ways you can put your fingerprints on something someone else built. (This might be pretty obvious.)\n\nNot sure if you're already homeowners, but get an honest understanding of energy costs for your place. Lots of sticker shock on our first propane bill. :/\n\nCurious as to where in Canada you are. From your hardiness zone, I'm guessing you're looking for somewhere in the Fruitbelt in Ontario or in the BC interior?",

            "comment": "We started with rainwater tanks, and solar + small battery (already I think we may need a bit more battery capacity for winter).\n\nEven though we do have town water &amp; electricity connected, after a recent drought where restrictions were down to 80 litres per person per day, and today's news of 25% power cost increase this year, I'm happy with the capital outlay. \n\nOn most days, we are self-sufficient, and on \"bad\" days, we'll just have to buy from the grid. Comparatively, to be able to be completely off-grid (several days worth of battery) would have meant a system 3-4 times the size (and cost).\n\nHouse has a woodstove, but we have to buy in wood. In our climate, it just warms up the house a bit at night. Possibly cheaper to run the airconditioning.\n\nHad to build a shed/outbuilding (see other comment regarding trying to find property with the infrastructure you want - much cheaper that way).\n\nIrrigation systems - I'm looking to the future, but will start small with growing. Getting water to where you want it takes a lot of poly pipe and pumps and etc, etc. Bloody typical that the best area for growing veges is also the furthest away from existing water infrastructure. \n\nWe have 5 acres, and get by with a good tough ride-on mower, and garden carts that can attach to the mower. Wish a mini-tractor was in the budget.",

    "postText": "So I had a question about growing pomegranates since I wanna pick up some trees, I saw a video and the guy said that he grows his trees next to a white pomegranate tree because the flowers are mainly male it helps fertile the other trees better and produces more fruit so I was wondering if I should do this to or if it wouldn't matter since it's self fertilizing. I'm new to gardening so what's everyone's opinion? Thank you for any replys",

They will have similar but slightly different harvest times, tastes as well as different resistance to bugs and diseases. Start with more than you need and then take out any that are problematic or that you don't like the taste of. \n\nAlso, the local wildlife will often take a share, so if you have more trees it will increase the likelihood that you actually get some.",

    "postText": "Yesterday I was feeling down because I found some property that is truly perfect for what I want, but going through the numbers I couldn't find a way to make it work financially. I mentioned it to my dad while we were on the phone talking about bees. So he told me two stories:\n\n1. In the 1950's my grandfather bought some land and built a house on it. A few years later, he had the opportunity to buy the land behind his. He really wanted it so he could put in a small orchard, but my grandma talked him out of it. For years, there was just a cornfield behind their house, until one day the property was bought and a church was built. One Sunday in the 60's, my grandfather and my dad were working in the garden and the pastor of the church came out and yelled at them for working on Sunday. The next day my dad and grandpa started building a fence. My grandfather regretted not buying that land the rest of his life.\n\n2. In 1973 my dad bought some land and started building a house on it. At the same time, his 2nd cousin bought the property right next to his. In the early 80s, his cousin still hadn't built on the property and offered to sell it to my dad for below market value. My mother encouraged him to buy it, but she had been diagnosed with cancer, the economy was rough, and he decided not to buy it. A few years later someone else bought it and built a nice house. Sometimes he daydreams about what he would have done with that land if he had bought it.\n\nSo based on those stories, here was his advice:\n\n\"Don't make the mistake my dad and I both made. If it's your dream to have a big piece of land to call your own and do what you want with, you need to make that happen. This land wasn't the land for you. Someday you will find some that is. And when you do, you need to jump on it, even if it's going to make things financially difficult for you for a few years. Just please don't give up on that dream.\"",

Finally got a tip on 31 acres up a super quiet dead end road. 2 side-by-side weirdly-shaped parcels. Super hilly. Thickly wooded. No power. No nothing. Price was $39k. We had $42k available. \n\nWe bought it. We bought it even knowing that that left almost nothing for building our home and establishing our homestead. But we did it anyway. \n\nWe moved into our unfinished house 4 years ago, and just this year (2023) are getting to a point where we feel like we're no longer camping but actually LIVING in a house. (Who knew that having reliable running water, hot water, a dishwasher, and a clothes washer would do that? All accomplished this year).\n\nSee if your dad can loan you the difference. You might be pleasantly surprised. A few years back we were struggling financially (from building our house), and researching debt consolidation loans, and my father offered to loan me what I needed. Out of the blue. I didn't know he was sitting on a pile of cash, but that helped us get over that hurdle, and now we're in a much better place.",

I realize you probably don't need a roof on top of your storage container, but maybe you could use a carport-sorta-thing for keeping things out of the rain. Then plumb a gutter to the IBC tote. If you can get the roof high enough then you can set the IBC tote on an elevated foundation of rocks or concrete blocks and get some water pressure out of the drain. (We use an IBC tote as our water storage tank and then pressure that for house use).\n\nPlus, adding a roofed structure (carport, shed, barn, whatever) is always a plus. We never have enough storage. Our first building was an 8'x12' shed, which was quickly added on to with a 4'x12' annex, followed by another shed roof along one side adding 3'x8', and then our 16'24' barn was mashed up to it, and then we added a completely non-square bump-out for our newly established rabbit colony.\n\nLast night my wife and I started construction on a 8'x16' wood shed that will hold 6 cords of firewood, plus a 5'x16' loft for who knows what, plus a 4'x16' overhang off the back where we stash as many building materials as we can so that our yard doesn't look like a white trash extravaganza.\n\nDon't give up. We've had 4+ years of glamping with that first winter being so incredibly hard that our catchphrase was \"...but we made it!,\" to a few years where our catchphrase became \"well, it's not nothing,\" to now where our new catchphrase might be \"actually, things are pretty good.\" \n\nSmall incremental changes will eventually snowball. Our power journey began with 4 - 120w used solar panels from Craigslist (purchased 16, but initially only had 4 wired), 4 - 225ah 6v batteries from Interstate, a cheap RV inverter, and some odds and ends from [Delcity.com](https://Delcity.com) and [Bluesea.com](https://Bluesea.com). That itty-bitty 480w system barely got us through that first winter. We used battery lights (that I charged at work) and lots of candles. The second winter was better with 960w, but a far cry from where we are now--3.8kw solar with 16.2 kw battery bank. And we still have a way to go. Gotta get a wind turbine this summer...",

(and in my state you cannot sue a farmer when on their land even with permission so the parents of that kid are in a shitton of debt dealing with medical expenses)\n\n\"perfect\" is obviously subjective, but i find that there's often a whole lot of things that would apply to that. as you said and i was vaguely getting at, location is usually one of the least flexible parts, but if you can make that element more flexible, a whole dang world of opportunities opens up. i recently found a 90 acre older growth hardwood forest for sale about an hour from me. mainly used as a hunting plot. super cheap. i'm considering buying it and putting an off grid cabin or two and large sawmill building as a secondary property as my current county is getting too dang expensive.",

            "comment": "Seconded!\n\nMy whole life I've always said I wanted some land.  A parcel to live on and one to just hold on to as an investment until a developer came asking about it.  When I was just starting college, my mom ended up in a situation where she needed to liquidate a friend's estate so she could qualify for aid to cover the cost of a nursing home.  Two of the assets that needed to be offloaded were a very nice 1970s volvo in pristine condition.  And a .25acre plot of land in a poor part of town down a street the city never bothered to finish so it's land locked.  Both were worth around $1000 at the time and since I was there while my brother lived farther away, I got first pick between the car or the land.  I picked the land.  With every intent of just sitting on it until someone decided to develop the area.  He only had a truck so he was happy for a nicer car with better mileage when he needed it.\n\nSo that's what I did.  After more than a decade, I suddenly remembered I even owned it.  We've been out of the state for more than a decade now and the tax bills got lost in so many moves so I plum forgot.  Checked to see that it was still in my name and caught up the back taxes then poked around zillow to see what empty lots in the area were going for.  I'd just been through there not long ago and the area was gentrifying like crazy.  So I figured \"maybe they finally extended that road to make way for the population boom!\"  NOPE!  BUUUUUT someone bought up 3 parcels right where the road stops.  For prices between $30k and $130k.  So I called a realtor and had her look into what I might get for mine since it's still land locked but the area is coming up.  $20-25k was the first offer she got.  For land I literally forgot I even owned and paid $1000 for.  And it's only going to get more valuable as the area improves and they finally extend that road all the way through.  And all I had to do was wait.\n\nI haven't seen my brother drive that volvo in years.  I'm not even sure he still has it.\n\nThe property we're building on is 86 acres (of shitty desert plains).  But it was important to me to get enough land that we wouldn't end up like your grandfather, annoyed with our neighbors and wishing we'd just bought more land so we didn't have to deal with them.  (we have terrible neighbors right now).",

The OP summed it up when they said they went through the numbers and couldn't afford it. It's similar to a car purchase except the dealer will use tactics to make you think you can afford it. Example, you found your \"dream car\" but can't afford it. Delear says hey we will take your trade and add the balance from the old loan to your new loan (negative equity) and push our the length of your loans for a lower payment. This situation is no different. There will be other opportunities, plus with rates as high as they are I think we will see lower prices in the next 1-2yrs as things cool off.",

If rates drop just refinance it. \n\nOne of two things are going to happen economically:\n1. We get back on track, inflation cools down, rates slightly drop and it\u2019s business as usually. \n2. Hyperinflation happens with the rate we\u2019re spending, everything gets out of control, dollar loses massive value and you\u2019re screwed either way. \n\nNot to be a doomsdayer but too many people hold off on making things happen. We ended up buying a house that was within our budget but lacking land when we really should\u2019ve done our original plan and went with the builder we were speaking to and bought some acres. The hope is we can make some renovations, cash out the equity, use that to buy whatever land is left at a not god awful price and build a house. But the odds of us finding what we want in 5 years time is going to be basically non-existent or extraordinarily expensive. All that to say, find something as close to what you want where you can still eat and live, and do it.",

We've been here 2 years and we still wake up saying \"I can't believe this is our house.\"  Or we'll be in the garden saying \"I can't believe we did all this.\" \n\nVery sound advice.",

He really wanted it, but my grandma talked him out of it. For years, his marriage went along fine, until one day that beauty queen moved in next door with her new husband. One Sunday in the 60's, my grandfather and my dad were working in the garden and the neighbors husband came out and yelled at them for working on Sunday. The next day my dad and grandpa started building a fence. My grandfather regretted not sleeping with that beauty queen the rest of his life.\n\nNot sure what the moral here is, but it was fun to change around some words, kinda made me feel like a real life chatgpt.",

So there\u2019s lots of ways to talk yourself out of making that purchase. But over the long haul prices go up. Even if you\u2019re not paying the bottom of the market value.

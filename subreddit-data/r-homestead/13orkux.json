A lot of homestead projects don't make economic sense in a normal situation.  However if you face a watering ban due to drought that 500 gallons might save your garden or trees.",

            "comment": "Many municipalities charge more for the back end (sewage and \"treatment) and arbitrary \"fees\" but the water is usually fairly cheap.  Similarly in our area, you can pick up your own water for like a penny a gallon.  But if you want it delivered, it's gonna cost you.\n\nWe're bi-locational while we build our off grid house but keep the old one for convenience and proper shelter in the winter.  Our water bill, even if we're gone the whole month is $60.  But in the summer when I'm watering plants in texas every other day it never goes higher than $64.  So I'm using about $4/month in water to keep a whole garden alive in texas heat.  But I'm paying basically $60 just to have service at all.  That's all treatment and fees and whatever BS they can get away with tacking on there.  And it's TX.  That money has sure as shit not been spent on the actual infrastructure upkeep.  Every other week there's another water main that's busted and shut down an intersection.",

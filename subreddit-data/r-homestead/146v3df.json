    "postText": "Im planning to start farming on my small homestead. Currently we have an 18 acre hay field and I\u2019m looking to turn half into pasture for cows. At most my feed supply should be able to support 8 full grown cows without bringing in hay. These would be totally grass fed and finished.\n\nWith this scale farm what kind of profit can i hope to make? This is neglecting equipment and infrastructure start up expenses. \n\nId like to start making money with the 18ac i have available and as best as i can tell selling hay or selling beef are my best options",

            "comment": "I've never sold beef but from what could find from our state, it was a lot more nuance that I realized (I was researching selling rabbits, actually).  There were a lot of nuances between selling a live animal and a dead one.  Selling for a pet or eventual slaughter.  Whether you processed the meat, the customer did it, or a third party butcher...  It got really complicated fast.  So I would kind of work backward from there.  Figure out do you have to pay someone to do the processing, can you leave that to the customer to figure out?  And if you do need a third party processor, I would start with them.  Find out the cost and try to book a processing date.  In some places, it can be several months or a year to get the animal processed and that works out to extra feed and care you may not have budgeted for.\n\nAlso, it's a lot harder to sell to customers if they can't find anywhere to get it processed.  So being able to say \"If you buy through me, the processing date is already booked\" can be a selling point....especially to someone who waited last minute.  Plus you'll know how much to charge them for the processing and can build that into the price.\n\nBest of luck!  I'm told it can be very hard to make a profit off animals without a large scale operation to really make the pennies add up.",

Selling hay sounds like a good start, as cattle require quite a bit of infrastructure, but remember that is taking a crop off your land each year.  Old-time farmers used to say something like \u201cthe only time hay should leave your land is in a cow\u2019s stomach\u201d, because livestock return nutrients to the soil.  So it depends on your long-term plans for the land as well.",

            "comment": "Right now 500lb steers are selling for $2.50 lb locally.  That means if you already had cattle this could be a profitable season, but if you are starting a herd your going to  be overpaying.  There is no single answer because the market fluctuates so much from year to year.\n\nThe trick is to efficiently raise cattle so that you aren't losing money in down years and can recoup your costs in good years.  That takes some experience and luck and is why very few farmers make a living solely from cattle.\n\n18 acres is pretty small, I would only put a bull and four cows on that.  If you have good cows and a good genetics you should be able to sell 4 calves a year and make $2k a year or so in profits.  Those are very speculative numbers obviously without knowing your climate, cattle breeds, grass type, feed costs, etc.",

Fences, vet bills, the cost of the cattle themselves. Water tanks etc. And don\u2019t forget hay. Unless your somewhere it doesn\u2019t snow you\u2019ll need hay to feed in the winter when the ground is covered. That\u2019ll eat into any profit of your hay bales. If you watch auctions you can probably find a small tractor, baler, rake, and sickle mower for under 10k. If you can do 5k a year your making profit on year 3. Around here the general rule of thumb for cattle is it takes 3 years for the calves to pay for the momma.",

I don't currently have a hay barn so I'm hoping to find someone that will buy the bales off the field. I've heard that is somewhat common around here though I'm not sure how much that eats into profit. At any rate it's just me so throwing 2000 square bales isn't the smartest long term plan.\n\nPhase 2 would be building a barn big enough to store the hay but I won't need to do that until I get cows which is part of the long term plan. At that point ill get a round baler and just move everything with the tractor.",

We know what it\u2019ll cost you (roughly) to buy weaned steers, but we don\u2019t know your property taxes, cost of irrigation, and a hundred other things that go on the expense side of the ledger. Also, we don\u2019t know how long you want to keep them, or what weight you\u2019re shooting for. We slaughter our grass-fed steers at 18 months so we have decent carcass weight. But the longer holding time means we \u201cturn around\u201d our animals more slowly than if you slaughtered at a year (with lower carcass weight).\n   \nWhat I can tell you with a high degree of certainty is that basically no professional cattleman would raise beer cows on land that can be reasonably used for hay production. Because the margins for hay are simply better. That having been said, you\u2019ve said you\u2019re getting insanely low prices per bale. I don\u2019t know why that is. If you\u2019ve got decent water, I\u2019d plant alfalfa, look to get three cuttings, and bale into large squares. You\u2019ll get premium prices for that product. Much better than beef",

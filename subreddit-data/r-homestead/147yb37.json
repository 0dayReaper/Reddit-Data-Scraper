Our 2 years of good luck ran out this afternoon.  \nI work from home and was home with the windows closed because it was raining\nSo I didn\u2019t hear anything.\n\nThe fox killed 1 in the coop, 2 in the fenced yard and 4 elsewhere. I only recovered 3 carcasses.\n\nOne girl survived but looks to be experiencing some serious PTSD.\nAh, the homesteading life.",

            "comment": "Foxes are effective predators and will destroy your flock as you saw.  Ours got hit hard too earlier this year.  We free range day and coop at night.  The coop is safe but free range is not.  \n\nAnyhow we tried lights and alarms.  They are not good enough. The fox will learn and adjust not to set it off.  The only fix was a livestock guardian dog (Great Pyrenees).   I tried not to get one - it was a last resort and it did work.  No losses yet (knock on wood).  I have witnessed a fox attempt and a bear attempt to get in the field.  Our dog stopped both herself - there could have been more but I witnessed those 2.  \n\nI will add our chickens are NOT in the field. Our predator was killing turkeys, ducks and guineas.  Our chickens free range the yard here.  She cannot protect them but she barks when anything is near their coops.  If I go in the coops she alerts, even just near them, she can\u2019t see me but she hears me (smells me too).  This just adds she does more than she even really can.\n\nShe also makes a great companion for our steer, rendering our goat buck useless once his kids are born.  All while protecting our turkey flock and everything else we have.",

I feel like that should be a basic step, personally. Chickens are damn delicious and darn easy to kill and eat for most everything in your environment. Foxes, hawks, weasels, just about anything with teeth or beaks will come after them. The first step is to delay the predators long enough that someone can intervene. \n\nWe had chickens for decades without too much predation, though a few were eaten every now and then, and we had pretty much a chicken fortress with two layers of security, outer walls, covering net, a dog that chased foxes off in exchange for eggs, etc etc.",

But I don\u2019t want to keep feeding the Fox. Two real choices from my rabbit-hole delve into keeping chickens again. An electric fence or an LGD. Both run probably a couple grand depending on certain variables. Both have pros and cons. \n\nI personally am making an electric fence paddock for \u201cfree-range.\u201d It\u2019s going to be maybe 500 sq ft for 15 birds. And I have a completely caged-in aviary-esque 12x12 ft enclosure. It\u2019s the best I can accommodate at the moment with what I have salvaged + what I can afford. I also bought a very skiddish breed of chicken. Plus bantam partridge Cochins bc I just couldn\u2019t resist. They\u2019ll be in a chicken tractor in the garden. But I\u2019m home all day. The fox is the biggest threat at dusk before the birds get put away. \n\nGood luck on your chicken journey. Don\u2019t get discouraged. But please keep your chickens safe; it\u2019s your responsibility once you bring them home.",

    "postText": "I board dogs and we boarded a Native American Indian dog a few months ago. The owner reached out saying they can no longer keep him and was wondering if we would be interested in adopting him. I\u2019ve thought about that dog often and we have talked about a farm dog/LGD that would be an outdoor dog to oversee the property and deter predators. He was great with all of the animals, didn\u2019t show any interest in them aside from a quick sniff and moving on. Great with kids and people (have an air bnb on site). He needs to lose weight and get used to being outside more as he\u2019s been an indoor dog. My question is: has anyone tried transitioning an \u201colder\u201d dog to be an outdoor dog? He\u2019s an amazing dog and seems like he would be such a great fit, I\u2019m just concerned he would be too set in his ways of being a more lazy indoor dog and wouldn\u2019t be able to get accustomed to staying outside. Thoughts?",

            "comment": "I have an LGD and there\u2019s a lot of misconceptions about them in USA culture, the history behind why is really interesting and you should look into it. Long story short, contrary to popular belief the best way to have a good outdoor dog is bring them indoors. Let him bond with you, love you, care about you and your property. And then walk your property with him. Walk the perimeter, show him where you want him. Teach him the work by doing it. If he wants to work and you give him access, he\u2019ll work. If he doesn\u2019t want to work then any forcing him would be cruel anyways. Most dogs like being outside, especially LGDs. Mine lays down when we get 50 ft to the house and gives me a look of \u201cwhat\u2019re you gonna do about it?\u201d Haha. \n\nHe would need to bond with you like any new dog you bring into your family. And then from there you can transition him to full time outdoor dog if that\u2019s what he wants. If he\u2019s crying outside to come in, again it\u2019d just be cruel to force him. You can\u2019t train that into a dog, they either want to do it or they don\u2019t. Most dogs, especially livestock guardian dog breeds, want to do it instinctively. So it\u2019s kinda just about getting him to bond with you and then giving him freedom and seeing what he does. \n\nI\u2019m not familiar with that dog breed. I think it\u2019s a really kind and wonderful thing to want to give a dog a home. Them being an LGD is built on them being independent and wanting to do it. You can\u2019t trick train a dog to want to guard / be nocturnal and everything that goes along with being an LGD. But his age should be 0 issue!",

Sure, that works if you just want a farm dog, who will spend large quantities of its life going back and forth from inside to outdoors. But... a proper, trained LGD? No. We have two LGDs - one Maremma and one Great Pyrennees/Anatolian cross, who live with our goats and sheep. And they do not come inside. They live full-time with our goats and sheep, because that is *their job.* Yes, they're bonded with us too, to a certain degree, because we visit with them, feed them, and have walked them around our pasture(s) repeatedly over the years. And, very occasionally out of their pasture(s) as well. But, no, coming into the home is NOT something they have ever done. They live with the sheep and goats. Because thats what their job/life is.",

Thanks for being so educational. \n\nI\u2019m happy for you that what you\u2019re doing is working. But it\u2019s just factually incorrect to insist it\u2019s the only right way. My dog also lives out with my goats full time and is 100% trustworthy, kind and well behaved with all the animals and all my visitors. And if she needs to go to the vet or is injured or has surgery she can also come be inside happily like a well rounded dog should be able to do. I often like to bring her in during hot summer days to cool off in the AC and relax. They\u2019re smarter than you give them credit for. Bringing a pup inside to bond with you is always a good thing and builds a stronger relationship with their human. It\u2019s silly to imply it ruins them for working. I\u2019m sorry you feel the need to keep them at arms length like that. I\u2019ll continue to enjoy my very nice guard dog who loves me and my family AND our goats/chickens/turkeys deeply.",

Whatever man you do you and go be incorrect on your own. Don\u2019t be nasty online to strangers. \n\nThe origin of \u201cleave the dog out with the livestock\u201d comes from European breeders sending their puppies over to the colonies way back at the start of America. They didn\u2019t trust the colonizers to train their dogs properly and worried the colonizers would bad mouth them. So they said the dogs are smarter than you lot, just put them out there they\u2019ll figure it out. Don\u2019t \u201cmess them up\u201d. Glad to see some ppl are still buying into this.  \n\nGenuinely idk what you want me to say. I\u2019ll do it my way because it\u2019s working well. You do it your way and good luck to you if you ever need to bring ur dog to a vet or tragedy strikes and you need to evacuate or relocate. I hope they\u2019re socialized well enough but i suppose it\u2019s not my business.",

This will, sadly, likely be a 'disturbance' to your AirBnB guests. That is, the biggest problem that many people have with LGDs. They are supposed to live full-time with their animals, and especially at night - because that is when most predation of all animals (whether goats, sheep, alpacas, chickens, etc) occurs. \n\nThus, that is when most LGD - Livestock Guardian Dogs - are most active. They tend to find a shady spot during most of the daytime hours and snooze away. Its about 2:30 right now, and I suspect if I wandered up into our sheep/goat pasture, I'd find both of ours, curled up under a tree or some brush in the shade snoozing away. But, they'll wake up as soon as you get anywhere nearby, and bark until they know who you are :) \n\nBut... at night? That's when they're awake. Some nights are quieter than others. The nights when there's coyotes around, or coons prowling nearby tend to be loudish around here. Thankfully, we don't really have neighbors to speak of. But... if you're looking to rent out your place to guests, I'm not sure they'll appreciate the racket that an LGD, or even a farm dog, looking out after chickens/goats/sheep/alpacas is likely to make at night.",

And I just bought some more property that I'm thinking about using for raising quail.\n\nI've heard that quail eggs are more nutritious. I live in a snowy, mountain climate so I'm not sure if quail could be raised here or not.",

One of my friends have a mast cell disease, and can only eat quail eggs (not chicken or duck) - so there must be something there. I know people who are raising quails about 1 - 2 hours from me, in a mountain climate with a few snow events a year. \n\nThe main issues with quails is that they can be quite frail, in that they are easily attacked by everything from rats to foxes (my quails are protected due to living in a the suburbs, and also have a very territorial cat during the day that is ironically afraid of them) - so their housing has to be secure.",

I keep saying we should go find the nests and grab like 1 egg from each nest and start our own flock.  lol.  So I would at least look up their temp tolerances and see what you think you could manage.  I don't know if they migrate or what but we certainly have quail all over the place.  zone 6B if that helps you with our temp ranges. edited typo",

I know we can legally hunt them but trapping/thieving eggs may fall into some entirely other category of no-no that I'm unaware of so it's one of those things for the back burner or when I get my hunting license this year.",

            "comment": "I raised some for a while. They're pretty awesome. The eggs are really good, but a little tedious to open at times. Definitely use a knife, cigar cutter, or quail egg cutter. Ours were pretty cold hearty. I built them a wooden sleeping box with a few small doors, and put a few infrared heating panels in their cage. They are frail, as another person said. Sometimes they'll spook, jump up, and break their necks on the top of the enclosure. One was mailed by a raccoon through the mesh. She lived years after that incident and was my favorite. They're very cute and silly. I handled ours from a young age to get them used to it. Sometimes I'd just pick one up and carry it around to calm my nerves. Sweet little birds. The males were a pain in the ass. Super loud and always picking the hens raw. They fought with each other. I let them mature, then ate them. We kept one rooster around to fertilize eggs. They're a good size for a meat portion for a single person. The eggs can sell for a lot of money to the right people. If you became the sole provider in your area, it could bring in a decent amount of money on the side. At least enough to support your flock. I like quail. They're cute and useful. They take up very little space. Just use a super fine and strong mesh so predators can't get to them. Ours were elevated off the ground.",

            "comment": "quails are small but very easy to take care of and butcher.\n\nThey don\u2019t roost like chickens, they make a nest like shape on the ground, sometimes, and it is an Easter egg hunt the other half of the time. \n\nZone 6 here and we had a few days of 0 and below and the birds seemed unbothered. In the winter I supplement light but never heat. They live in an open air aviary that I added some windbreaks to in the 4 coldest months. I run them on deep bedding ( just add pine chips after very wet days) and clean out the area maybe twice a year if that. \n\n1 quail per person + 2 sides \nor 2 quail and 1 side is a good meal\n\nLayers live for 2 seasons and then go into a soup like meal\n\nMales get 8 weeks \n\nEggs are better than chicken, great to bake with, and shine when used to egg washing meat before breading. \n\nRandom tip: they are messy eaters so place their food in a dry place\n\nYou can pack em dense but I recommend 1 sq ft per bird and ground contact is way better than putting them on wire in a cage. They must be out doors after 5 weeks. They poop a lot and make a ton of dust of kept inside, good luck with that. \n\nThink and research aviary and not coops\n\nEdit: cotornix quail from my shire farm is how we started. Hatched eggs in cheap Amazon incubator with 60-80% hatch rate",

            "comment": "If you have 4 seasons and want eggs year round you would probably be best with a dedicated structure for them with electricity.  Then you can brood in there as well.  You would need multiple cages for your layer and breeding groups and a grow out cage.  So keeping them all enclosed in a shed together is the best bet but it is a commitment.  And if you're going all in egg rollout trays, poop collection and water system should be well thought out to save time.  They aren't as self sufficient as chickens.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI have 40 broilers (I think some variety of ross 308 or so - not really sure which breed exactly). When I look in the documentation of Ross 308, I see that the cumulative intake of feed ad 5kg butchering weight is around 10kg - so a factor 2.\n\nI was doing a back of the enveloppe calculation on how expensive our chickens would be, and I took a factor 3 (ie, 15 kg of feed for a live weight of 5kg). Do you think this is a reasonable estimate?\n\nI supplement the feed with kitchen scraps (but that is more as a desert for them - they are 40 chickens after all), and some stale bread that I collect in the neighborhood. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey are growing really really fast. I limited their feed intake a bit (I think at around 6kg per day now). I want them to grow a bit slower, so that they develop more dense and flavorful meat. Does this make sense?\n\nEven though grain has become expensive, we would still be way cheaper with breeding our own animals in comparison to buying even cheap chicken - let alone the free range, high quality meat that we get from our animals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

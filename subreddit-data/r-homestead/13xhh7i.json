Could you survive living off the grid already? \n\nCheck out [wwoofing](https://wwoofusa.org/en/) there might be some good options for you to go to someone else\u2019s farm/homestead and learn from them. You\u2019ll gain great experience if you\u2019re able to find a good wwoofer. Take your time to find one and make sure it\u2019s a good fit. \n\nYou can wwoof for a few months/years until you find somewhere you really like. \n\nNow for my opinion. Flights are cheap. Like very cheap to fly most places. Don\u2019t limit yourself to being on the west coast. Weather is the biggest factor when it comes to living off grid and if you\u2019re trying to be self sustainable having 3-4 months of winter will be difficult. \n\nSome suggestions. Completely change your lifestyle and mindset. Save as much money as possible. Live very modestly and focus on having enough for a down payment for a home with acres. Good places with good people and good vibes is Tennessee (Nashville, Chattanooga, Knoxville, Johnson City). Texas (north east of Austin). Alabama (north east by Chattanooga or Huntsville).  South Carolina (Greenville, Columbia, Rock hill). Florida (Gainesville, northern ocala, lake city). New York (hyde park, new paltz, rhinebeck, pleasant valley). Missouri (Kansas City). The list goes on. That\u2019s some suggestions :)",

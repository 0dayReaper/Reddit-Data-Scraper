            "comment": "So about a half decade or so ago my neighbour and I were doing a coop with some pigs. It was late past sundown on a fall evening and we wanted to get the pigs loaded up for the early morning visit to freezer camp. My 6-year-old daughter was determined to be part of the process. Obviously, wrangling 6+ month-old pigs is not for a 6-year-old human so she stayed outside the fence. Only after a few minutes of wrangling pigs into the trailer did I realize my daughter had been so quiet and had become an apparition in the evening darkness. I called to her making sure she was okay, and all I got in return from the darkness is her voice yelling \"I LIKE BACON!\". She was standing just out of the light watching us wrangle the whole time and not wanting to interfere.\n\nI love to tell that story. :)",

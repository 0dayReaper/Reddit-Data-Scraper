            "comment": "Most books beyond the most cursory will focus on a specific type of goat - dairy, meat, or fiber. I'd pick which characteristic you're most interested in, and go from there.\n\nFor the dairy world, the adga has a lot of good info on their site, as does thegoatspot dot net. Blue cactus farms has a number of useful videos, and fias co farms also is a good resource.\n\nKeep in mind that many breed differences are appearance based - with dairy, your main functional difference is going to be between Nigerian dwarfs (lower production, but higher butterfat percentage) and all the standard breeds (where there's far more variation within a breed than between breeds, despite the fact that the internet loves to highlight the minor breed differences). That said, if you just want to visually tell a nubian from a lamancha, there are plenty of guides at the sites I mentioned.",

I asked about books because I really want to learn about goats.  \nAlso being able to differentiate between the breeds and knowing the traits well to tell if a goat is pure breed or not(this maybe the most difficult thing to do if at all possible).  \n  \nI also thank you for your insight about how the difference in the breed itself might be bigger than that with other breeds and I think you are 100% correct.  \nI will check the websites that you have recommended, but if you also have books recommendation, I would love that.  \n  \nI am interested in few breeds, Nigerian Dwarf, Boer, Nubian, Saanen and maybe Shami too.  \n  \nThanks for your reply, it was very helpful.",

Books are much better for doing a deep dive on a particular aspect once you've got the basics. Fortunately, it's goat show season right now, so look up a local ADGA show and go and chat people up. You'll get to experience how loud the Nubians are in person, the judging is very informative about what to look for in a goat, and folks are usually happy to chat during downtime. \n\nIf you really want a book to read, 'Dairy Goat Reproduction' by Rachel Payne is very informative, but won't be that useful if you go with Boer (those are meat goats) or Shami. \n\nGiven your list of goat breeds, I would say you need to spend a lot more time figuring out what you're looking for in a goat, and then pick breeds that meet that standard - you have a list that has full size and miniature, meat, dairy, and hard-to-find conservation project breeds. It's a bit like someone saying the list of colleges they're considering is Santa Clara Community College, Harvard, and RIT - you need to put a lot more thought into the 'why' of the goats rather than reading lists of (often exaggerated) breed characteristics.\n\nI'd say first you want to decide if you want miniature or standard sized goats. That will depend on your space, personal preference, predation risk, and production goals. From there, if you want to go dairy and miniature, that means Nigerian Dwarf. For meat goats, you'd be looking at Pygmys. \n\nFor standard sized dairy, the most common breeds are Nubians, Saanens/Sables, LaManchas, and Alpines, although Toggenburg and Oberhasli aren't hard to find. More niche breeds, like the Golden/British Guernsey, are interesting but somewhat of an advanced project due to the limited gene pool. For starting out, I would strongly recommend sticking with a common breed in your area (both for breeding genetics and to allow you to be picky when selecting starting stock).\n\nFor standard sized meat, Boer or Kiko are (afaik) the most common options, although I'm not a meat goat person.\n\nIt's not possible to identify if a goat is purebred based solely on appearance, although you can sometimes identify goats as not meeting any particular breed standard. If you're concerned about lineage, I would stick to registered goats - for dairy, the ADGA is a fantastic resource, since it tracks not only pedigrees but production and conformation evaluations across generations. One important note, registered is not synonymous with purebred - you can have a 'registered grade' goat, and eventually breed back to 'registered nubian' (or what have you) once the goat is 7/8 that breed and meets the breed standard.",

            "comment": "Storey's guide to raising dairy goats, and they also have a guide to meat goats I believe. \n\nWith most of the dairy breeds, it's mostly appearance. LaManchas have small ears, Toggenburgs are brown with white points/face stripes, Oberhaslis are bay or solid black, Saanens are white(Sables are colored saanens), Nubians have Roman noses and floppy ears. Alpines are often chamois(half black/half tan). They are similarly sized. Nigerian dwarfs are mini dairy goats, so you'll get less milk. Nubians have higher butterfat milk, so good for cheese and butter making. Saanens are some of the highest producing(volume). \n\nPopular meat goats are boer, but fainting and spanish goats are also becoming popular for meat. \n\nThe livestock conservancy has a bunch of books on breeding, I bought quite a few because I'm into saving endangered livestock breeds(I breed crevecoeur chickens currently).",

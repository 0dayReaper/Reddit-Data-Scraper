Do you want to golf, swim, shop, go to church, send kids to school? How far do you want to be from 'stuff'? Preference for oceans, lakes, mountains, forests? What kind of animals- a few chickens, a few cows, deer, exotics?\n\nYou're going to need to narrow it down a little, otherwise we're going to give you the Top 50 US States (because there's decent reasons to homestead in just about any one of them).",

Most of the time we are very happy with our decision. \n\nWV is not great for jobs, culture, restaurant options, music/nightlife scene.\n\nI love WV because my husband and I moved here to homestead full time and raise a family. I spent my early twenties in a large city and got my fill of nightlife. We travel to large cities 2 hours away occasionally for shopping, restaurants and different experiences. I would not recommend moving to WV if you are single and looking to find a partner.",

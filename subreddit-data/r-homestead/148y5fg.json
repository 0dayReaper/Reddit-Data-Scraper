Depends on how big the area is, if it\u2019s small I would pull it all and then keep pulling it as it sends more shoots out of the ground, at least once a month or so. It\u2019s the only effective way imo. It\u2019ll take a couple of years of persistence, but once the initial pulling is done, the following ones aren\u2019t so bad. Same way to deal with blackberries",

Young leaves don\u2019t have the waxy cuticle layer yet and readily absorb the herbicide. \nLater in the year, mow or string trim it in sections and apply the herbicide quickly after mowing and then again after you notice new leaves.",

It is always best for her to stay with her own mom, if possible. You can tie mama goat to something secure and bring the Eliza to drink. Keep Eliza safe from kicks and head butts. You can use hobbles temporarily to keep everyone safe.  Be soothing to mom and feed mom her favourite treat while Eliza nurses. Try for about 10 mins and make sure Eliza is hungry and mom hasn\u2019t just nursed the others. If mom refuses again, try to give Eliza some sibling time with mom a safe distance away. She needs to learn how to be a goat (social cues, vocalizations, acceptable behaviours).",

Then last year she had one single kid born stillborn. Then we bred her back this year and I\u2019ve been stressed through the whole pregnancy because of the stillbirth. So four days ago she started having clear discharge which then turned into thick old blood color. Which I thought could be indicative of another stillborn. I called my vet but he said he couldn\u2019t do anything and that it may be fine so to just let her go into labor. I consulted with two other experienced goat farmers who agreed with me that the presence of old blood was concerning. So when she went into labor I made sure I was there and was much more hands on than I maybe needed to be because I was expecting complications. But also, only having raised one single kid before, I wouldn\u2019t have thought she\u2019d do well with three kids anyway. But anyway it was a huge surprise to have three living kids come out. And I have questioned if my presence is what caused her to reject one. But she tended to the other two, and this one stayed attached to the placenta and covered in goop. I left them alone for an hour and came back to check and she was still covered in goop and the other two were totally cleaned off and sleeping with full bellies. So i took this one in. I\u2019ve been milking mom for the colostrum to bottle feed her and she has taken well to the bottle. I definitely will give her time with her siblings so she learns how to be a goat and try to reintroduce her to mom.",

Having multiple stillbirths could have messed up her ability to manage and she might have read that baby as \"dead\" if it didn't come out as lively as the others.\n\nOr she knows something you don't and you just rescued the antichrist.",

My dad had a mama who almost always had quadruplets &amp; she was able to nurse them all just fine. He had many ladies who had &amp; raised triplets no problem. (His herd was about 400, he didn't interfere with them unless there was an emergency &amp; was able to see how things went when they were left to their own devices. He rarely had to hand raise a baby.)",

I sat with her while she gave birth, and literally 10min after the tiny one came out my coworker started a tractor and the living baby jumped into my lap!! And then it turned out the mom has mastitis (her teats were extremely hard and turned purple and she was in sooo much pain) so the living baby ended up being a bottle baby. I am soooo glad I didn't have to give her back to mom as she healed, because that baby was ridiculously cute, affectionate, and was attached at the hip to me. It must be SO tempting for OP to keep this baby for their own even if the mom accepts it again lol. Baby goats are so damn cute and pure it awakens my mothering instinct so much it makes my head want to explode lmao",

It's so weird every animal I meet has something about them that reminds me of childhood pets, like a certain turn of the head or the way it looks at me when I say something to get it's attention or the way it walks over. I just .. can't. I eat chicken eggs and do eat meat occasionally, but I can't eat something I knew to be alive :( my partner thinks I'm too sensitive",

            "comment": "As much as one can love and appreciate the possum, it's still a wild animal and unpredictable. I knew when I was young that possums are maybe the \"less serious\" among most of the varmints, but that touching, allowing it to hang around, etc are unacceptable. \n\nOur dog Schultz was a white German Shepherd, who was effectively a guard dog around the few acres. He came up with a possum a few times, and my grandfather had to reason with me that it was okay for this to happen, and showed me why. He'd not told me yet, but all of our chickens were preyed upon the night prior to Schultz bringing us the smaller possum.\n\nTheir heads were gone. Innards gone. Like they left my sweet chickens that I had filled with love, completely empty. I can't say I gained a \"new hatred\" but my mind was changed forever about the wild species of the world.\n\nIt's best to be kind to all animals. Sometimes the most kindness we can do is avoiding contact or setting up protections and repellent...but inevitably, sadness does occur with each cycle of life and death. Sure, you can be sad for the possum, but it was being a wild animal in a not-wild-animal place like the coop. Simply.\n\nGood job doogy!",

Because if you have raccoons around as well, it could be them killing the chickens and the opossum was just the derp that hung around. While they have been known to predate on chickens, I've never known them to be as ravenous as other predators. They typically just eat eggs. And removing them is as easy as picking them up by the scruff and taking them somewhere outside the coop. They don't rip your coop up like raccoons, so as long as you put in a little effort into keeping your birds tight at night, then you should never have a problem with opossums.",

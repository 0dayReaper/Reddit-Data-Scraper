There\u2019s just so many of them, we can\u2019t keep up. I would guess they bear something like 150+ gallons most summers. One year we let a friend come pick as much as she wanted while we were out of town and she put up more than 20 gallons in a week. Mom won\u2019t charge anyone to pick because we have so much so we just tell any friends and family who want to do the work to come on over and pick what they want. I also picked about 6 gallons of blackberries this week, so we have plenty.",

But I learned how to work, learned a great work ethic, and I never knew what an \"allowance\" was, because I always earned my own money.  When neighboring farms needed help getting the hay in, a whole bunch of us (other area farm kids) would go and work for them after our own work was done, and we never tired of offers to make money. I started paying into social security at 14 because I was working full time.  (child labor laws are different for farms, in case anyone is wondering)\nKeep doing what you are doing. Pay them fairly and make them into solid young men and women.  They will benefit for the rest of their lives, and so will you. My soil is naturally acidic, and blueberries thrive.  I've thought about expanding to an acre or so of plants, and maybe you have given me an idea.  What are you doing to market all of yours?  Fresh and juiced?  I wouldn't know how to price juice here.",

The one little girl had a birthday and she declared that \u2018she doesn\u2019t need extra pay\u2019 because she still \u2018feels like she\u2019s 9 instead of 10\u2019. It was such a cute thing for her to say. The kids around here are a different type of creative and intelligent than a lot of their city-dwelling counterparts. \n\nThere\u2019s a huge market for fresh blueberry juice around here. I sell a quarter gallon for $12 plus bottle deposit. I am the only one but any competition would probably take me over as some farms have thousands of plant and adult workers. They could really get into better efficiency and machinery to make it even cheaper. An acre though! That would be so beautiful and productive. 97 plants only takes up about an eighth of an acre give or take. If you do go through and plant blueberries my biggest recommendation would be to till in a hybrid clover that does not takeover through spreaders and plant that throughout your paths. It is way better than grass and easier to manage and all around amazing to look at and feel. Unfortunately blueberries can not utilize clover nitrogen. Also, instead of raw sawdust for in between plants (though this isn\u2019t good for the base because the manure is too fresh) use saw dust from a stable that has been soiled. Puts nutrients out and makes weeding a breeze. Unused sawdust can be nitrogen demanding which irks me.",

My wife is a gourmet cook and is experimenting with a Blueberry barbecue sauce as we speak.  We also grow jalape\u00f1os and are going to make Blueberry jalape\u00f1o jelly, which is wonderful with lamb.  Much of our surrounding area is naturally alkaline to neutral soil due to  ancient river deposits. We happen to live on the only natural hills around which are acidic clay with a pH of about 5.2 - 5.4, (only a couple square miles of hills, and the rest is the Cajun Prairie) and very poor soil for most things, but blueberries grow like crazy.  You have given me ideas, and if you don't mind, I'd like to keep your screen name saved for future Blueberry communication.  Maybe something mutually beneficial can come of it.",

They would be yielding more, but I only recently learned that you should prune about 1/3 of the bush per year once it is mature (about 5 - 7 years).  This makes more room for vigorous new growth that yields more berries and larger, higher quality berries.  I will be pruning in the next few days to weeks, when I have time.  I picked 6 quarts off of a single bush in one day this year, and it was a second picking, and I did a third smaller picking about a week later.  That plant yielded well over 3 gallons this year.  We had perfect growing conditions this year, with good timely rains.",

It is really hard to buck against pH. It can be done, but it takes a lot of effort. I have a lot of family in the Charlotte area. Beautiful countryside there. They also need full sun to produce well. Be patient. In a couple of years, if you can keep your plants healthy with acidic soil amendments, you will suddenly be harvesting a lot of berries.  The first few years, we wondered if 12 plants would be enough.  A yard man killed 7 of the original plants by heavy handed weedeating around them after I told him not to.  They have really shallow roots that can't be disturbed.  The bushes died slowly, but I fired him quickly.  It still pisses me off when I look at my huge 5 original plants, and my 7 smaller replants.  Ah well, that's life, I guess.",

He also had a big 250-bush blueberry patch for something like 40 years, before he got too bad in health to maintain it and it went back to the landscape. I know he did start some from cuttings, but I don't know much about the process unfortunately. If you have a local university nearby, they're usually really helpful with that kind of stuff and helping you pick the right variety of plants.",

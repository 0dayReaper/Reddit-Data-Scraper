    "postText": "Looking for tips on poultry netting. I have a premier one solar setup and am not getting full power to the net. Book says I should be getting 8k volts with my energizer, I am only getting about 2k. \n\nChecked power from battery and that was fine.\n\nCut vegetation real short so there is minimal contact. \n\nWe have rocky soil so we put in a longer ground rod, but it didn't seem to help. \n\nAlso looking for tips to keep the netting tight. We put in some extra support posts but it hasn't really helped.",

            "comment": "I have the same poultry netting and similar charger. Keeping the net at 8K all the time is basically impossible, a fools errand and not even super necessary. 4k and up gets the job done for us, but shooting for 6k is better. First, you need to make sure that your battery is fully topped up. I'm not a big fan of the ac charger that's included with the unit, so I take the battery out and manually charge with my own overnight (or during the day, whatever is safer for you) if it's getting low.  Next, you need to make sure that the unit is properly oriented to capture as much sunlight as possible during the day. I'm not sure where you are located, but it's getting closer to summer so angling the panel further toward 180 is important. Should be perpendicular to the sun at noon. A deep grounding rod is a must, we threw out the one that came with our unit and replaced it with a 3 foot rod. Get that grounding rod at least 24\" inches down, it works best when it gets down far enough that the soil is still moist in the dry summer. Keeping the net tight and reducing ground contact of the hot lines will help a lot. I like to use the premier one FT posts between the normal ones where needed (like the spot on the left side of your pic that the net goes over a hump on the gound). These FT posts are also really good for your corners, put them in on the outside angled away from your corner then tie them on with nylon string.  Double check to make sure your connects from the alligator clips to your unit are tight and the same for your fence connectors if you are using more than one length of fence. If you are still having trouble just give premier 1 a call, their customer support is really good. Good luck!",

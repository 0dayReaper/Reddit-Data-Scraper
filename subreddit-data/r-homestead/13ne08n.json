            "comment": "I'm just begining with dual purpose and haven't butchered any yet, so take my advice with a grain of salt. I originally wanted Black Australorps because 1) they lay a lot 2) they're reasonably sized and 3) the roosters usually have nice personalities. There weren't any available where I live, so I ended up going with Plymouth Barred Rocks instead. They're one of the original dual purpose breeds and mine have been laying an egg every day reliably and they're bigger than my hybrid Bovan Browns. I think they will also have the same qualities I was looking for in the Black Australorps. A local breeder sells Chantecler chickens and that's our plan to try next year\u2014but they're rare and hard to find. The breeder said Chanteclers are her first pick for meat, and Plymouth Rocks are her second.",

The roosters tend to have crests that grow for decent visibility when compared to a polish rooster, but most crevecoeur hens are pretty blind once their crest is completely grown in. If you can't see their eyes they can't see you(or much else!) is a good rule of thumb with crested breeds.",

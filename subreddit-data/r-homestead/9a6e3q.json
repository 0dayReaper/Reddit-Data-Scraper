The place we go has fields for cows that are typically marked off by barbed wire fences but we happened on a herd that was not in a pen. When they saw us they started getting closer and closer - we jumped over a barbed wire fence (containing another herd which was luckily far away) as the herd ran by. We went to get tetanus shots shortly after. Relationship goals or what. Moral of the story? Animals are animals and they do what they think is necessary to survive. I don\u2019t think they were trying to attack us but they sent a message that was like \u201cwe aren\u2019t moving so scram.\u201d ",

India still has slaughterhouses, you may get killed by a mob of misguided Hindu people for eating beef but people still do. It's religion based in both those examples, Buddhists need for nothing and feel sparing lives will help to not come be reincarnated as a dung beetle. They I agree don't see cattle as a commodity. Although unfortunately mankind had already been selectively breeding cattle for approximately 8000 years before buddhism came about. Hinduism seems washy on the topic, different translations are taken different ways. After the advent of buddhism the idea of not killing cows but instead using them for milk and fertilizer started picking up support although it really wasn't until around 400 or so years later that it was the common belief. They were still slaughtered and eaten though mostly ceremonially. You have to go forward about 2000 years to get the the last century before the vilifying/murdering of beef eaters started. ",

This summer however most days it is completely covered. (this is a photo after we got rain and it looks better than normal) we are located in northern Alberta Canada. Any ideas on how we can (hopefully naturally) clear our pond?",

            "comment": "From what I remember of my undergrad science classes, algae blooms in small bodies of water like this are often caused by nutrient imbalances usually caused by runoff (think fertilizer or pesticides). The bloom causes a feedback cycle where it sucks all the oxygen out of the water, making it inhospitable, then dies and as it rots the nitrogen levels spike, furthering algae growth. If left unchecked the cycle can turn your pond into a dead zone.\n\nMost of treatment we learned was about prevention. Although I did read about a lady who physically got into her pond and raked out the algae every spring to reduce the nutrient load over time. idk how feasible that is at this scale though. It took more than ten years but she ended up with a pond that stayed clear and she used the algae for compost. Ive also seen people get ducks or stock their pond with algae eating fish to keep it under control.\n\nGood luck.",

Aquatic plants, fewer fish/less fish food, preventing fertilizer run-off, and improving flow-through can all prevent more algae and reduce the current algae amount.\n\nVarious algaecides can take care of the immediate problem, but you really should contract with an expert if you want to go that route. UV light is also effective at killing algae, but your pond size may make that impractical. And if you don't address the cause, the algae will come right back.\n\nEdit: it takes a bit of work, but you can make a land plant \"filter\" by using the pond to feed a hydroponic system. The nutrients feeding the algae will feed your crops just as well.",

Take a walk around your area and see what natives are already occupying those roles and either sparingly harvest some for your own use (if legal where you are) or pick some up from a local garden store",

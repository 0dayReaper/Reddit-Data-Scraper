    "postText": "Hey Everyone! \n\nHere\u2019s the deal. All of us from the US basically know that it is going insane. No matter the side you are on politically things are going absolutely crazy. I am trying to figure out what I want to do for me and my siblings so here are my thoughts and what I am looking for and any thoughts people have would be so helpful!!\n\nI would like to move to Europe with how everything is going crazy right now. I love the European lifestyle in general (yes I know each country is different) and there are great countries to live in very affordably. However..\n\n- Visas are a pain in the butt. Some are easier than others but you pretty much don\u2019t know for years if you are going to get kicked out and if they will let you stay etc.\n- The building codes there are \ud83e\udee0. In most US states you can build a tiny home and have a homestead no problem but everywhere in Europe the building ranges from strict to insanely strict which makes things a lot harder and ALOT more expensive to build even though cost of living in general is more affordable.\n- Things in the US are just more accessible in general (Amazon, garden shops, Ace Hardwares). I want to eventually lean away from all of that but getting things you need to start a homestead or build things etc is so much easier in the states.\n\nWhat is everyone\u2019s thoughts on everything happening in the states? Do you think it\u2019s good to stay? If you think the US is the place to stay then why? What states would you recommend with cheap land, good access to community, and decent weather year round (including avoiding natural disasters like hurricanes?)\n\nA side note is I am also so worried about community when living in the middle of nowhere on my own homestead. I am a huge people person. How does everyone build community when you don\u2019t live by each other or have a built in homestead community you are going to? \n\nI know it\u2019s a lot but anything would be helpful! Thank you in advance!!",

            "comment": "The truth is, anyone wanting to homestead on a budget is going to have to make some sacrifices.  You just need to figure out if you're willing to make enough of them to still pull it off.  We made sacrifices on where the land is located.  Quality of the land.  Taking the slooooooooow ass path of building the house ourselves instead of getting a pre-built or contracting it out.  Haul our own trash.  Pick up our own mail.  Amazon will never come to my door, I'm sure of it.  lol.  I have to keep a pitchfork in the back of my van so I can even get to the gate for our road if it's tumbleweed season.  They stack up almost as tall as our van.  I have the receipts.  We have to fence out the neighbor's cows but they still get in and break shit if they're bored enough.  Drought will always be a nagging concern at the back of our minds.  Dust storms so bad you're supposed to wear respirators if you're outside.\n\nOr we could have sat around whining about how much easier properties cost instead of being in the process of building our house with our own two hands.\n\nThere is not only affordable land out there.  There is cheap land out there.  But you gotta be willing to do the WORK of sitting down, setting your parameters and finding land you can afford.  You gotta do the WORK of due diligence to make sure you can afford to turn it into something livable (and the WORK of affording that).  You gotta do the WORK of dotting those Is and crossing those Ts with the local gov't so it's all on the right side of things.  You gotta do the WORK of not snapping your fingers and writing a check for someone else to do the hard stuff.  And you gotta do all the physical WORK of actually making it all reality.  And even once you've finally \"finished\" and built a homestead, you have to do the WORK of homesteading.  Doesn't matter where that is.  Not everyone is willing or able to work in all those lanes... sometimes all at the same time.  And that's not even factoring in figuring out some kind of business plan or at least a way to have it all break even.\n\nSo seriously, it just sounds like you have a lot of work to do.  Stop minding politics unless it directly affects the parcel you're buying (water rights, landowner rights).  Start the actual physical work of just looking for parcels of land you could even afford to buy.  Just set yourself that goal.  Don't even pay attention to where they are.  Start in your state then the US then Europe and just see what kind of properties you can get for your budget in 5 states.  Then pick one from each and crunch the numbers on making it livable.  Then figure out what it would take you to actually save up that much and start doing it.  Just start the work.\n\nWe're building our own house on 86 acres. We paid $300/acre.  It all started because we sat down one day and said \"Let's just see what we can get for $20-25k and we'll go from there.\"  A new car would be nice.  Land was our dream.",

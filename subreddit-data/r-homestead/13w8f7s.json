These birds can get a little gross, but they are not too bad as long as you restrict food and keep the grass as fresh as possible under them. I like the Joel Salatin tractors. They are the hungryiest animal I have ever seen. No other chicken is even close to the ease in which these dress  it brings me back to these birds every year",

I think we will try chicken tractors and, if that is unsatisfactory, transition to heritage breeds. You cant beat the value of the Cx's, though",

We have found that raising them through 7 weeks gives us a better yield over all...especially in hot weather.\n\nWe feed the starter 23% protein for 3 weeks and then in the 4th week we begin transition to a 20% protein for the next 3-4 weeks.\n\nI am of the opinion that the issue for the bird in the picture here is heart attack...I have literally watched them die...typically on their backs. I cut them open and find a \"yellow\" fluid around the heart. The meat seems to be fine as I have cut it open...inspected it....cooked it...tasted it it was fine...we have not done that often...just cuz...I know a few people who don't like that idea...to each their own.\n\nBacking off on their feed...and feeding them twice a day with no food at night has helped us as well.\n\nIn your case feeding them the higher protein \"starter\" all the way through may just be too much...this is what I have found in my experience.\n\nThe missing feathers on the breast is due to dragging themselves back and forth from the waterer to the feeder...if you do it in a tractor in the grass there will be more feathers on the breast...and the birds are cleaner overall...nice for butchering.\n\nAnother thing I have experienced is that if they get cold in their first week or so...they are prone to have issues as they grow. It starts to show up late week 5.\n\nCut this bird open if you still have it...if there is this yellow fluid in it...heart attack is likely.",

Remember you\u2019re not raising a chicken, you\u2019re raising a Cornish cross broiler bird created to grow as quickly as possible using the least amount of food and water.",

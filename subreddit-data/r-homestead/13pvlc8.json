I really don't doubt you at all, but I still have this feeling in my heart like I don't understand why it's such a bad idea, even though it's been explained and we've done some googling. I get it, but I don't. The color is a paint primer and sealant all in one, should protect it in theory. \n\nSO reality is going to teach us and we're gonna find out why. By seeing what happens and going from there. The second I start to see it wearing away, and the whys and how's of what's happening. Well get it protected, and I'll have some experience.\nBut I just wanna learn first hand.\n\nEdit. I never went to imply here that I'm not going to do something we're definitely adding metal as well. I was only talking about my own feelings as I learn through this process..\nThis has been a pain point for me. Good hardwood, even new osb is very expensive. We found a deal and everyone has torn me down for it since.",

People often get rid of it cheap or free because the holes make it useless to reuse but it makes great siding on animal barns such as yours. One observation from a guy who has been there. That hay is going to suck when it gets trampled down and covered in chicken manure. Go with shavings if you can or your cleaning is going to be a nightmare of hard work.\n\nEdit to add a couple tips,  Don't let the negative people on this sub get to you. You will figure it out and you are doing good. Check out some videos of books on building basic structures from wood to help you along the way. Also I see you mentioned that it gets really cold their sometimes. That means snow. If you don't feel comfortable jumping on that roof because it might break you better make it stronger now. Maybe add some diagonal bracing to the walls as well. Snow can get extremely heavy and you sure don't want to have to try and fix a building when it's stupid cold out and everything is covered in snow.",

This has actually worked for 2 years now... smh I really need to rebuild. It's built its standing its painted I think you did fine minus the venting... it's way nicer than my coop.",

OP's price is close to how much it cost me to fix up a 12x16 horse shed to turn it into a chicken coop (and fence off a pasture). When a 4x8 sheet of anything (except osb) is more than $20, building anything gets expensive. Building even a 4x8 chicken coop (the size needed for 8 chickens without squishing them) would cost close to $800 in new materials.\n\n4x8 1/2 plywood: $25\n\n4x8 T1-11: $45\n\n4x8 corrugated steel: $40\n\n2x4x8: $3.20\n\n2x6x8 PT: $8\n\n4x4x8 PT: $13\n\nPaint: $30\n\n5lb16DNails: $20\n\n1lb #8 3\" screws: $9\n\n1lb #9 2\" screws: $9\n\nTotals:\nOutside sheeting: $270\nFloor: $218\nRoof: $53\nPaint: $30\nFasteners: 38\n\nOverall: $609. Note that this doesn't include taxes, roosts, nest boxes, run, windows, hardware cloth, door hardware, or any possible foundation work. \n\nI will say that this is for a walk in coop (just like OPs). You could cut this price in half probably by not making it a walk in. Some materials like the roof you could probably find cheaper if you don't care as much about the looks or don't have to worry about snow load. My rule was it had to be walk in. We have very cold and windy winters and I was not going to stand outside pushing through and digging out feet of snow to tend to the chickens.",

We had one hen actually die while she was laying an egg because it got too hot in the coop in the middle of the day in the heat of summer.  Lesson learned.\n\nPut the roost bars as high as possible (all at the same height) while still leaving space for chicken head room.  They will fight over the highest bar if the roost bars are different heights.\n\nThey will lay eggs in the darkest corner of the coop.  Put the nest box in that corner and then they will use it.  Otherwise, nope, they will lay where they feel it\u2019s safest.\n\nDon\u2019t use osb.  The rain will destroy it.\n\nI have 6\u201d of wood shavings on the floor of the coop.  It cuts the poop smell to almost nothing.\n\nGive the chickens as much space as possible in the coop.  I had ~50 sq ft for 4 hens.  Sometimes, they won\u2019t go out in the snow during winter.  Bored chickens pick on each other a lot.  Crowding your chickens into a small, poorly ventilated coop is how they get diseases.",

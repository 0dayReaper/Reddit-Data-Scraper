    "postText": "Decided to build this pond for the ducklings. We have extremely high clay in central Kentucky. Dug out the hole, and watered the dirt in a barrel to separate out the clay. Readded said clay to the bottom and added a bag of Benton in the form of floor dry from work (free). Holds water long enough for the ducklings to get a bath in but after a few hours it's drained again.\n\nI think I need to tamp down the bottom to compact it, but any other thoughts on ways to keep the water in? I keep barrels under the gutters to collect rain water, so I can route a pipe to the pond to added water as needed, but at the current rate I'd be out of water in two days. Thoughts?\n\nAlso thisay be a duplicate post, if it is I will delete either this one or the previous, just not sure if the first one actually went through or not.",

It's basically impossible to filter. I've seen it posted before to properly filter duck water you would need an in ground pool pump on a kiddie pool basically.",

And more than likely we will be adding a sort of trench system to allow the water to flow near/through our garden that is just to the left of the pond. Really, I'd just like to control the water loss, instead of it draining wherever.",

The poop breaks down into compounds such as ammonia. These make the water toxic and will kill the fish, the plants  or other things that try to drink or enter the water. So, what gets those nasties out? Well, stuff eats that stuff in something called the nitrogen cycle. Those things will come about naturally. What won\u2019t come about naturally are the plants that eventually consume the nitrogen those things eventually break the nasties into down the line of eating and pooping. Those need to be planted. If you make your little pond a wetland with all the plants necessary, your ducks will be safe and happy in clean water.\n\nFurther reading for interested: http://www.wetlands-initiative.org/nutrient-removal",

I have about 40 birds right now, mostly ducks, and I have four smaller kiddie pools in rotation.  Two of them get sprayed out and filled daily; the fourth is less used and filled in hotter days or if we !gasp! go somewhere over a weekend.\n\n(The third pool is damaged but used when I have ducklings)\n\nEven with two filled daily, they have a layer of gross that I'm usually not going to refill without cleaning first.\n\nWe got one of the really big plastic pools a few years back and it's more likely to cause drownings since it has higher sides and it's exponentially harder to flip to drain and clean.  These days it only catches rainwater and has a sludge bed waiting for me to plant something in it, I guess.\n\nMy ducks are mostly Muscovies so they don't really swim but they use the pools to drink, clean bill membranes, and bathe.\n\nNot mentioned but highly underrated: nipple waterers for drinking water.  Ducks still like a pond but clean water all the time is super nice.",

If you genuinely want to go the natural route, you\u2019d have to remove the ducks, dig a pit, and then gley it, which is typically done over the course of years using pig manure and other plant compost matter; this is also dependent upon your soil having clay already in it.  You\u2019d then have to plant a lot of barrier plants along the edge for stability, water retention, and preventing runoff and you\u2019d have to ensure you have enough depth and plant matter to properly support an ecosystem that fish can thrive in. \n\nYou seem to want to do this as quickly and cheaply as possible - which is *not* possible while also being ethical to your animals. You need to either accept that to do this naturally you will need years to do it correctly *or* you need to adjust your plans to accommodate the animals you already have.",

But I may just try and seal this one up well enough to hold fish, even if I resort to a liner, and get the ducks a separate kiddy pool or something that can be cleaned. Seems the level of research I did wasn't quite enough and as I always say, you never know what you don't know. So both to you and everyone else who has commented, thank you for your input!

We just used a large kiddie pool, 7ft x 18in deep, carefully drilled a hole in the side and attached PVC and a valve. Put some wire mesh over the valve to keep the pipe clear, only had to drain it every other day, and the water watered our plants, after we harvested berries for the season we watered the berries, the rest of the year it flowed directly to fruit trees and some flowers. \n\nWith than many ducks you\u2019ll want to do it daily and will need to make it bigger.

They sell bags of dried bentonite clay pellets to make a clean clay layer (the granular bentonite is what kitty litter is before they add perfumes and colored crystals to it for branding purposes), check with a water or oil well drilling supplier near you. But it needs to be way bigger if you are going through the trouble of lining it with anything. Dig a bigger pond, throw down a bunch of bentonite, wet it, spread it out to a 2+inch thick layer, top the bentonite off with sand or soil, and do anything else needed to make it a functional pond and not a puddle (last bit is not part of my world). You won't be able to walk in it without breaking through the clay layer unless you make everyting way deeper with thicker clay and soil layers, but it would hold ducks.",

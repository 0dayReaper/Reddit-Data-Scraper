            "comment": "Pickett County Tennessee is where we set up shop. We arrived in 2020 after permanent remote became a reality in my finance job. We decided upon buying land here due to its low population, temperate climate and relatively inexpensive property. Furthermore, we are incrediblly active in boating and adjacent Dale Hollow Lake (actually a reservoir technically) is incredible for this purpose. We live well outside of town, Byrdstown, which is the county seat, but it is pretty easily accessible and contains everything we need with friendly folks and a decidedly hands off governmental dynamic. We have 2 young children, one in K and one in 2nd grade and so far we have no complaints with the schools.\n\nWhat we don't like is the soil composition could be much better.  We live relatively close to the lake itself, so the terrain is quite sloped in places and rocky. We have managed to mitigate this to some degree, but that is the hand we were dealt. Feral swine have also began encroaching into this part of TN. We have nowhere close to the kind of issues with this as they do further South, but it is a concern nonetheless.\n\nOther than that, my Wife and I are quite happy. Since I still work a regular remote day job, there is never enough hours in a day to get done what I need to perpetually, but that comes with the territory I suppose. As soon as I get one project or issue resolved, another shows up to fill the void instantly. Overall, I think what is most striking is how liberated and free I feel. Its hard to describe, but just about every morning I wake up with an ear to ear smile on my face.",

            "comment": "Lower Central Missouri\n\nPros: Lots of game to hunt and plenty to fish, lots of high hilltops and lower vales, not many people around; people who are around end up getting very close knit with you, locals do better business than sale barns\n\nCons: Nearest town is about an hour and a half away, lots of rocks; therefore need to treat your land and soil to get things to grow correctly, poacher re-insurgence, prices are going up for feed and livestock; prices of sale value are dropping\n\nThoughts: It's harder to deal with people than it used to be. Considering how tough it is to start up these days, your best bet for said start up is trying to roll some place in the Midwest. Missouri is pretty diverse when it comes to ecosystems. We've got all but a few different biomes here. You can start with chickens even. Just as long as you've got a lot of room. Because of people flocking to Missouri and other Midwestern places, poaching and trespassing has started becoming a bigger problem. Used, it wasn't so bad. Maybe a few every other month but now it seems like people are poking around more often, say about four every other week now. Recently, squatters have been a big issue. One feller I confronted on my land told me he was from California and is waiting to hear back from a store about a job, he didn't know he was on land a person owned. Things certainly aren't like how they used to be, even five years ago.\n\nAdvice: If you do plan on trying to come to Missouri for a startup on a plot of land try to remember to be as peaceful as possible. If you're strapped for cash and can't necessarily afford it right away, you can apply for a farm loan. They get you enough money to get you started up and can be pretty leaniant with payments, just as long as you pay and do good business. Try to shoot for land pretty decently away from a highway or high traffic road; if you have any livestock get out or released, the last thing you need is having them get sent to God, via vehicular slaughter. When you do get your land and want to plant crops, you can send in a soil sample or have the agri boys come out to your place and test said soil. Try to invest in a couple goats as well. They can eat down an overgrown forest in a month's time. Chickens are a good starter as well. With those two animals alone, you can get a pretty decent farm up and running. If you're looking to build yourself a cabin, just pick one up at a Lowe's or whatever is closest. They're cheap and can last as long as you take care of them. If you're near a scrap yard, visit often to see what kind of materials are there. We have a corral made out of old highway shoulder runners. The cattle we have, have no problem bumping and pushing into them. They've held up extremely well for about a decade as well. If you find land that has a natural sloping down sort of hill that's fair in soil, make sure you use the lower vale for cattle or larger livestock if you can. Have the top be where the yard and crops grow. If you are lucky enough to find flat land with hardly any sloping hills, make sure to not cut down every tree in said field if you plan on having cattle, this gives them shade all around the fields and still gives them plenty of room to roam and graze. Also, try to have a couple of rifles too. If you do or don't hunt, at least get a varmint rifle or know how to set non-poisonous traps. When you have crops, obviously birds, rodents, and other scavengers will want you food. Having at least a .22 can go a long way. On the topic of wildlife, bears have been on the rise as well. Try not to kill them if you can, we're in their habit as much as they are in ours. If you must shoot one or are in dire need to defend against one; bear spray, .357 or .44 magnum rifle or pistol, or an electric fence will help against them. I personally use a .357 lever gun for all my hunting needs. If you do plan on hunting, stay in your own fence and land. Last thing you need is being shot because someone thinks you're poaching. Don't over hunt. Hunt and trap for how many people you have to feed. One good sized buck or at least two doe will last me for a long while, and to put it into view we are me, my wife, and my dog. Remember to use every bit of whatever you catch. Doesn't matter if it's down to the tail of a rabbit. Everything has a purpose and especially when you've got a family but hardly any money. So lastly, be polite and make sure you do try to at least make contact with neighbors. When our neighbor came up from Texas, I was just a boy still but I got with my grandpa and we baked some cookies and went over to introduce ourselves. We've been like family ever since.\n\nConclusion: Remember that trying to start up your own co-op isn't like how it used to be or how it is in the movies or TV. It can be rather dangerous if you're arrogant or unprepared. Make sure to read up as much as you can on farming, ranching, and other outdoor activities. If you can at all, make sure you keep a stash of money in your home just in case things don't work out or perhaps something breaks. Be polite as you can and keep an open mind to all things when you're out by yourself. Use as many resources as you can so that you can make your own staple in absolutely no where. Remember to ask questions and try things out to see if they work. There's no shame in trying.\n\nIf there's anything else that comes to mind, I'll be putting it down here in the edits. I'm always free to help answer anything I can, I've been doing this since I was just a boy and now I'm about 21 and still going strong. Anyway, take care.\n\nEdit 1: Something that's easy to do that doesn't take too much time is buying, trading, or finding a camper shell or perhaps the top of a van. Having an enclosed space for a seller or perhaps just a dug for chickens is nice. All you have to do is dig down a bit, cover the top with a tarp, then recover with dirt or if needed, add cinder bricks or junk tires or even rocks over the top to make sure it doesn't get moved. At one point, we had one of the shorter school buses from the scrap yard and disassembled most of it until it was just the body. Welded metal panels over the windows and buried it until there was about half a foot sticking out of the ground. We turned it into an outdoor seller. It stayed pretty cool in the summers as well inside our little makeshift seller. It was nice.\n\nEdit 2: Just read a post a moment ago about if we have any recreational and entertainment things on our steads. I commented on a couple of things we have or perhaps a couple ideas I know of. Sometimes it's good to have extra things to do so you don't get bored or resent doing day to day tasks.",

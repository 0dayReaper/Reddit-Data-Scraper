Everyone has a YouTube channel and it\u2019s all about how much attention you can grab and how much more \u201cself sufficient\u201d you are than the next guy. The funny thing is most of the people I see really lack a lot of the skills necessary to live the life they claim they\u2019re living so it makes you wonder how truthful their claims are. Again not insinuating that OP is going that route but I definitely see a pattern in millennial homesteaders.",

Groceries for just me is $80-$120 every 2 weeks  but I splurge and definitely have food waste that I'd like to cut down.\n\nActually too well...I pretty much spend $10-$15 every day I work and would love to change that as it would save me about $200/month.\n\nHoly shit typing it out I'm spending $2000 a year on work food.\n\nAnyway to truly answer your question.  My housing is pretty cheap now after the refi about $550 a month for mortgage + tax + insurance.  Which ends up being less that 20% of my monthly take home pay-- Housing is generally the single largest expenditure and when you get it around 25% of net monthly income things start becoming much easier.  Second is car payments and  I don't have a car payment and I live close to work so I only spend about $60 month on gas and ends up being about $40/month for insurance + registration.",

If you're making $120k+, you can crush those loans EZPZ in six months, not six years.",

Definitely will finish them off before kids come along. \n\nMy point was just that I have a hard time believing these two have completely built a debt free homestead (their youtube suggests it was all new construction) without a good bit of outside assistance and luck. *maybe* they\u2019ve just been super cracked down for a few years here but the numbers don\u2019t really add up.

So I figured I\u2019d try the YouTube thing. The reason for limited comments and reply\u2019s is limited cell service. It just took us 3 days to upload our latest video.

For example if we have a mortgage when we could have purchased our house outright, we get tax benefits for having the mortgage, a larger emergency fund Incase something goes wrong, and the ability to invest more money in the market at an average of 7% earnings vs the 3% I pay in interest on the mortgage. So that\u2019s a 4% gain per year on that money not including the tax benefits. Why wouldn\u2019t I go that route if I can. \n\nLet the downvotes begin",

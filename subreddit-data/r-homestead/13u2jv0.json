Haha.) Community Lands is an actual seller of land -- it owns the parcels listed on its website -- so while it looks like LandWatch and other listing services, my interest is specific to this company because I'm trying to evaluate how much I trust various representations on their website regarding a specific parcel. I'm doing all the digital due diligence I can, such as looking at GIS maps, online deed history, zoning laws, etc, but firsthand experience with this seller is one thing I know nothing about!",

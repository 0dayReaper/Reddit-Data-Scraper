    "postText": "The field I ride in is very uneven and I wasn\u2019t happy with it. So started working on leveling it. First lesson why my box blade wasn\u2019t doing the job. I had the blades the wrong direction. Once I fixed that progress was made. Today I did more work but my blade kept filling up with dirt. Dr Google and YouTube told me I need to adjust the angle on the bottom. So tomorrow after work more leveling. I keep pulling up roots from the trees I removed two years ago (hired someone for that). My footing is clay and sand mix so I don\u2019t need to add anything to a base. I will let grass grow once the leveling is done. The irony is next next I am selling because I got a job transfer to Texas.",

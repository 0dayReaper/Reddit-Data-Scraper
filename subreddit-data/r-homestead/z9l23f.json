                                    "comment": "&gt; the question is why would anyone want to buy your tomatoes? \n\nSo I learned something interesting about this fairly recently.   \n\nIndustrial food production factories, for the most part have specific contracts with the farmers that supply their products. Even though they don't own it, they control the product chain from the ground up. I had been familiar with this business practice in other agricultural industries, mainly chicken, but didn't know it extended to vegetable farming as well. \n\nSo, for example, Heinz Ketchup.  \n\nALL of the tomatoes that go into Heinz ketchup products every year come from only about 150 farms in the San Joaquin valley in California.    Heinz has specific contracts with those tomato growers so that they *ONLY* produce tomatoes for Heinz Ketchup. \n\nHeinz specifically provides the seeds to those farmers from stock that is specifically developed by a Heinz owned company.  SO for example, most ketchup comes from the \"Heinz 9557\" and \"Heinz 9663\" tomato varieties.   When corn syrup became more expensive in 2021, Heinz actually bred slightly sweeter tomatoes to adjust the recipe.   The seeds are sold in lots of 100,000 for about $1200.\n\nHeinz has specific rules about how the tomatoes are grown, and what chemicals can be used, and the farmers are under contract to sell 100% of the tomatoes to Heinz, in part to pay back the loan.   Heinz pays contract rates for the tomatoes,  $70-90 per ton.  \n\nThe same is also true, for example, for the potatoes used in McDonalds french fries.   McDonalds uses 3.2 billion pounds of potatoes per year, that it buys primarily from 3 suppliers, who contract with specific farmers that grow a specific variety of potatoes just for McDonalds.\n\nI was more familiar with this because it's how many chicken producers like Tyson Farms do business.   They will loan you the money to build houses and will loan you the broiler chicks but you have to sign a contract where basically they own your soul, and you agree not to do any poultry business other than raise chicks for them because of biological contamination qustions.",

Small scale purchases will yield the highest price per pound -- someone who is buying tomatoes by the tonne certainly isn't paying a buck a tomato or even fifty cents a tomato. Your $80 per tonne isn't far from the historic prices I'm seeing ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/936158/processing-market-tomato-prices-by-us-states/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/936158/processing-market-tomato-prices-by-us-states/)).\n\nEven if we ignore the required land, equipment, and labor required to *produce* and *harvest* all of those tomatoes ... say they ripen over a 90 day period (which is super generous in my part of the world, but again pretending it's reasonable for the sake of argument), you need to move like 44,000 tomatoes A DAY for 90 days. Where are these things going as they get picked? How to I transport them to these hypothetical customers?\n\nThis guy's hypothetical tomatoes aren't an example of scale, they're an example of generational wealth. If you inherited a few thousand acres of land (probably complete with an irrigation system and greenhouses), equipment, warehouses, and a fleet of trucks to move 'em ... then *maybe* you could employ a lot of people for planting, harvesting, and selling at farm markets where you might hope to get something even approaching a buck a tomato. Even then, you aren't *netting* hundreds of millions of dollars -- you've got electrical, transportation, and labor expenses to pay. That's not building a tomato empire from a handful of overpriced plants -- that's using millions of dollars in inherited assets to net maybe a couple of million bucks a year.\n\nBut, inaccurate numbers aside, this is why we sell started plants in the spring instead of trying to sell produce. Someone *will* pay me $5 to $10 bucks for a healthy heirloom tomato plant that's been grown in my greenhouse. Same for niche pepper varieties (think really, really hot), herbs, and flowers. I don't grow varieties you can pick up at the local garden centers, so there's not a whole lot of competition. Whatever doesn't sell is planted in our garden that year. This doesn't scale into the millions -- there just aren't enough people in the area looking for unique heirloom varieties -- but we come close to netting enough to cover property taxes.",

Small plant nurseries can actually do extremely well locally and undercut bigger players because of lower overhead. Spring plant starts every year, fall mums, and things like shrubs and trees can be propagated from varieties where patents and trademarks have long expired. You get a good number of stock plants to take cuttings from, portion off an area with ground cloth and sand beds for rooting cuttings into liners and pot them up and there is money to be had reliably from year to year. Most states getting a nursery license isn't a giant expense or headache as long as you do your homework properly. I have a friend who just does garlic in friends yards and braids them up with dried straw flowers and sells each braid for $40 a piece at a few farmers markets to basic white women and clears about $7k a year after expenses.",

If you started with good black dirt you could probably squeeze out three successive plantings of tomato plants without too many problems.\n\nThe real question is space. \n \nWhere the fuck are you going to put 156,000 tomato plants?  \n\nA full grown tomato plant takes up maybe 36 inches of space. So figure a square yard of space per plant.  \n\nThere are 4,840 square yards in an acre. \n\nThat means for that stage he is talking about densely planted tomato plants covering 32 acres.   Nothing but tomato plants planted in a 3X3 grid.   \n\n Once you're full grown there won't even hardly be walking pathways. You just bake in Walking Pathways and you're probably talking about 40 plus acres.\n\n\nIf you can find me 40 acres of prime black dirt Farmland that doesn't cost at least $500,000 and probably closer to a million for the kind of land we're talking about, I want to know about it.",

We bought each lily at the local pond store, and it came in a plastic container with some lead or metal wire wrapped around the root to give it weight in the water and it was planted in pea gravel/fish tank stone. The lily was maybe the size of say half a cigar, maybe a little bigger. Each one cost maybe 25 dollars. The next year, I took out all the lilies  and they were now the size of 6 to 8\" and double the thickness. They really grew well. All along the shaft of the root/tuber, there were a series of small white buds. I must have had 5 or 6 on each tuber now. To grow more, you just cut up the tuber so that there was at least one bud per section and replanted it. I did that and the near after, same thing. One tuber yielded 4 or 5 the next year.\n\nYup, seriously considered getting into the water lily business. I didn't have a big enough pond, or a year to wait. The biggest/most expensive part of all of that - the materials and the pond. I needed a massive pond. I calculated it to that I'd need football size fields in a few short years. \n\nYeah...all I needed was thousands of square feet of pond liner, pond wall making materials, tons of stone and baskets, good weather, a few years, and a bunch of people to help me harvest the tubers each year.\n\nCould have been a billionaire if only.",

This seems like an easyish way to make the most of it.",

Put it on a low heat and mash it up with a potato mashed. Stir/mash every 10min for 2-3 hours or until it gets as thick as you\u2019d like. You can strain it while it\u2019s hot if you like or leave it \u201crustic\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s really easy, you just have to keep a eye on it.",

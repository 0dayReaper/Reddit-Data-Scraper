            "comment": "If you've got an instant pot, or other pressure cooker, you should look into making stock with it. It takes waaaaaay less time to extract all the gelatin. I throw just my carcasses in, let it do it's thing, strain, simmer for like 2 hours with aromatics, reduce down to a demi, and then freeze into ice cubes. Basically an instant pan sauce and if you add a few cups of water you've got almost instant stock, which takes up way less freeze space\n\nI like making stock the traditional way, but always get a little worried having a burner on all night, so the instant pot method is great simply because of that lol",

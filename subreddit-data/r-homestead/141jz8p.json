    "postText": "Planted a row of spinach every week and while it's sprouting just fine it's not growing very fast. This represents basically a month of growth for the first row I planted. We had a bit of a heat wave already and I know spinach doesn't like that but it should be doing more than what it has, should it not?",

            "comment": "What kind of soil is it growing in? I just read a post, maybe on r/gardening, where someone had a similar issue. The plants got started well enough then slowed down to nothing. It was a nutrition deficiency in the soil. Also when you use soil that is still going through the compost process, it apparently causes nitrogen levels to drop before slowly going up again.",

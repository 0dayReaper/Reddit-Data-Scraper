    "postText": "I am currently raising my third batch of egg-layers (a very small production - just six girls in my back yard) and as I've grown more used to these fluffy little companions, each flock has become trained quicker to the way I want them to behave - routine has been well-established.  \nAs the weather cools, foxes are starting to prowl, so every night I go out to check that all of the girls are on the roosts at sunset, safe behind the automatic door. Tonight one of them was tardy and got herself shut out, she came up to me and did the flutter-squat dance as I walked towards the coop. She was very happy to be picked up and deposited inside with the other girls - a far cry from the first batch, where chasing, catching, and handling them was always a little fraught.  \n\n\nI treat these girls as livestock, not pets, but there is still a level of attachment and a deep satisfaction to keeping healthy, happy creatures in a mutually beneficial arrangement. They bring me such happiness.  \nPhoto of one of my girls on a cool day, seeking the warmest corner on the back deck to snooze out of the breeze.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qj4wfid5l0b1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2b1c8d7f4866e56f55ad09262121742a0f5345de",

Actually our 2nd \u201cflock\u201d has been the most difficult to train (first generation chicks from our first chickens). The reason that hatching was mostly boys.  I removed the boys I didn\u2019t want and the rest of the group wants into the \u201cbachelor pen\u201d.   It has taken almost a week to get them to go into the hen coup like they should.  \n\nGetting any of these hens to lay an egg where we want is impossible too\u2026\n\nTurkeys - I rather work with them honestly (it\u2019s our main farm animal)",

    "postText": "Serious question. This happened Monday morning.  \nHow do you get the live skunk out of the terrier's mouth? I couldn't grab it, kick it, shoot it.  \nAfter a few minutes naked in the rain at 4:50 am, finally grabbed an empty feed bag and wrapped up the skunk. Poor dog was scrubbing his muzzle on the gravel probably trying to get the scent out of his mouth. All around a not fun morning.",

He kept his distance but my elderly mother decided to run out, get on the other side of the thing and scare it back PAST the open front door to the back woods. It found the only carpeted room in the back of the house and lived under a dresser for two days.",

Literally the only way to do it is to put in the time training &amp; building a relationship w your dog to where he respects &amp; values your word over anything.",

The working dogs somehow tolerate my kids crazy pet, but he's a killer. \n\nWe have lived in a rural area for the last 25 years. When you can't see your neighbors dogs run free typically.  Honestly, a dog this peppy should be locked in a barn to keep pests out and kept in there. \n\nHe doesn't chase cows, hogs, chickens and kids just love the bloodthirsty bastard. He kills all venomous snakes and occasionally rat snakes but leaves the rest alone. Even seen him kill bumblebees, lol. \n\nWe all live with our choices.",

            "comment": "I want to thank everyone, and correct a few misconceptions.  \nMy dog is very well trained and smart. He responds to commands, but also (very encouraged) monitors and defends the property. He keeps the deer out of the garden, has treed several racoons, will spot and alert snakes, and even leaves the baby chickens alone (now). \n\nI wasn't asking how to train my dog, just sharing how shocked into inaction I was in the instant. I also was not going to \"save\" the skunk, he would obviously have gone after the chicken eggs if left to be one with nature. I will relocate a black snake, but I won't tolerate nature ruining my livelihood. \n\nPoor guy got a mouthful. Multiple baths in peroxide, baking soda, and dawn and still very aromatic. He is wonderful, and will keep doing his job.",

Even without grabbing the skunk I guarantee your dog got a mouth full. From my experience the skunk smell on dogs is just part of country living that I got used to.\n\nThe only thing you could do for the skunk is keep your dog away. Otherwise, if you're that concerned with the skunk being hurt or killed you should reconsider the ethics of owning an untrained dog bred to kill things.",

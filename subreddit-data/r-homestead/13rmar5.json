    "postText": "I will be moving back to rural family land (later rather than sooner unfortunately), but I\u2019m a planner.  \n\nI spent large amounts of my childhood there.  My great uncle always had a terrier type dog, and they always slept outside close to the chicken coop.  Part of me thinks that when I go back, I\u2019d get a dog but they\u2019d stay in the house with me.  But here\u2019s the thing- I just realized that a big reason he always had a type of terrier was to kill rodents.  (Yes, I\u2019ve spent my adult years in the city). We had barn cats as well, but I plan to resurrect the chicken coop and maybe eventually get ducks.  Animals were never allowed in the house, but that just seems sad to me.  \n\nDoesn\u2019t keeping a rat killing dog inside at night defeat the purpose? Would it be better to give a home to two so that they have a friend at night? I can feel my grandma and great uncle rolling their eyes in their graves at me.  Do I just need to get over myself? \n\nAny thoughts are appreciated.  Even if they\u2019re just to make fun of me.",

She doesn\u2019t even want to leave the field and come into the yard.  Her job is to keep the other animals safe - not give us company. \n\nYes keeping her inside would defeat her purpose.",

And she would agree it\u2019s cruel to keep her from doing what she does best so it\u2019s outside.  \n\nThe issue I see with a \u201crat dog\u201d would be they would want to pounce chickens by nature - to play with them and they could injure them.  I understand your family had one that didn\u2019t but that doesn\u2019t mean any dog will work.  Most dogs don\u2019t do well with birds.  We were very particular to get our dog from another poultry farm.",

This is why I recommend a rat dog over a barn cat because you can prevent non-targeted animals from being killed (ex. native song birds) unlike with a barn cat. Generally you will have your dog out and 'flush' the rats out of wherever they are hiding and let the dog kill them. You don't want to flush them all at once or your dog will miss some. \n\nSo yes you can keep a rat dog inside at night. \n\nNow for LGD, they need to be with your livestock at night.",

I'd especially keep a terrier inside at night, keeping predators in mind (even cayotes might be an issue). \n\nThe livestock guardian dogs stay out to live up to their name - they're guard dogs.\n\nI have this discussion a lot with some of my parent's friends in rural areas about our hunting dogs. I live in a high rise in a big city, my dog sleeps in our bed and runs lines in a downtown park yet outperforms most dogs we meet on the field. It just depends on how they're trained, I spent a ton of time training my dog vs some guy that insists his dog needs to sleep outside to be a real hunting dog yet it won't drop a bird when asked or crushes it when retrieving or doesn't have tight recall. People are weird and old school about dogs in some places, farm dogs and hunting dogs seem to have this problem. \n\nAll that matters is how you train them, unless you literally need them to be bodyguards for your sheep or whatever. In which case they need to live with them",

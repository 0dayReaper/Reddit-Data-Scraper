This is rather new to me, so any info would be appreciated. I figure I should be looking for lead and other heavy metals, but anything else?",

If you test the soil for metals, it is a guarantee that you will find naturally occurring metals, at minimum. If you want to be very conservative and analyze the soil and water, no matter the past uses and for your peace of mind; sample them and have them analyzed for VOCs, SVOCs, RCRA metals, PCBs, pesticides, and herbicides. That will cover pretty much all the bases for possible contamination on the property.",

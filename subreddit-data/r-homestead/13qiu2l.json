I would like to add a manual pump for use around the homestead, but it looks like the typical pitcher pumps are only recommended up to 25 feet. \n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for a pumping system for a 50+ foot well?",

Get their thoughts on manual pumps. You're free to ignore their thoughts if you don't like them, but they might have seen a particular model do well or poorly in their experience. They might hate trying to maintain some brands, and find others much easier to keep in working order.",

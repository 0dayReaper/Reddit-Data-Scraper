    "postText": "Hi,\n\nWe recently bought our property. It's only 4 acres,  but it's what we've got. We're located in Prince Edward Island, Canada which has a similar climate as somewhere like northeast Maine.\n\nI have a barn which needs roof repairs, but otherwise is in good shape and held animals until around 2018 according to the information we have. There are four stalls which look big enough for two cows each, plus a chicken coop area. We don't know if cows were on the property any time recently - it may have been goats.\n\nWe have about 1 acre of \"forest\" that serves as a windbreak to the north and is full of pine, birch, cherry and weeds, 1 acre or so of garden, the rest is the house and grassland with a few other small pine and cherry woods scattered around the property.\n\nSomeone was clearly grazing animals in the past because the grass, even when short, is so dense that in some areas it makes my 20hp lawnmower struggle. It's like shag carpet.\n\nAnyway, with the above in mind I'm thinking of adding cows to the property and am wondering about whether our land size will support it, and the costs of upkeep per cow on land this size. I've been looking into small breeds like Belted Galloway and Dexters because they should do well in this climate. I'm more after the milk than I am the meat. We would take some for our own use and sell the rest either pasteurized or turned into butter and cheese at a roadside stand at the end of our driveway where we have low speed traffic suitable for a stand like that.\n\nWe'd probably get two to keep them happy. Whether we'll carve up more grass to grow corn or some other cow food besides grass is an open question - is it worth it or should I just buy hay and corn from a feed store? Grain seems brutally expensive but do I have enough land to grow enough? We could probably sow corn and get a decent harvest this year if we do it in the next 2-3 weeks. I have a Massey 135 tractor with a loader if that makes any difference. No bailing or mowing implements for it yet.\n\nAny advice appreciated, especially on the economics/costs of this",

            "comment": "The one thing I'd add is, make sure you have a stable source for hay bales. Even if the cows are out grazing all summer, you will still need to have a source for winter feed. Ask around what bale prices are. \n\n  Also, what happens if there is a drought year? Where will your bales come from? They will most likely need to be trucked in, and you know that the bridge toll will add to that price.\n\n  Btw, I used to own a horse farm in NB. So I'm happy to hear about my east coast friends.",

They are high in butter fat, which the milk is great for milk products and a small framed cow. I usually would give them some supplement with the grass and feed hay in the winter, either you buy it or have someone bail your hay, depending on how much hay/pasture you have.",

It gets even colder here than in Maine - this winter we saw a few days that went down to -31f (-35c) not accounting for windchill. I feel like a shaggy coat breed might fare better, even in the barn it will be freezing cold with temperatures that low.\n\nThe other difficulty is finding one - I looked for mini jerseys around here but couldn't find any for sale.\n\nAny comments on cost per head per month or year in a situation like this where we'd basically have 2 acres of grass growing?",

I grew up on a dairy farm in Michigan, and my Grandparents had Jerseys until PBB wiped them out. (Feed company accidentally mixed fire retardant in with the feed. Farmers and their family's got sick. They even made a movie about it.) But of course if you can't find them, find what is available.\nI have one cow on about an acre and half of pasture and about 5 acres of hay. The neighbor bales it for me, and I take what I need, and he takes the rest. I probably used 6 round bales over the winter and about $30-40 a month in grain.",

            "comment": "Do you have experience with large livestock? If not, this is an excellent way to end up in the hospital or morgue. Even a small cow will outweigh you several times over, they spook easily, and they don't care who they step on when they do (or even normally, really). Source: I sometimes get called in to help people who've done something similar with horses. I'd also figure out how you plan to breed your cows - dairy bulls in particular have a reputation for trying to kill people on purpose (there's a reason AI is used so extensively with dairy cows). \n\nDo you know what the laws around dairy licensing are in your area, and/or are you ok with the risks (including liability lawsuits) of selling black market dairy? Because of the listeria risk, dairy is typically much more regulated than other homestead products like eggs, honey, fruit/veggies, or jam. In my state, it's easier to legally butcher and sell chicken meat than to get licensed to sell cheese, and for good reason.\n\nGiven the above, I'd recommend starting with a pair of goats or sheep. The animal size and milk quantity are both much more manageable. To put this in perspective, a good dairy goat will give you on average just under a gallon a day for 10 months of the year. A cow will give you just over 6 gallons a day. Since, as you noted, you need a pair of whichever you get, you're looking at 2 vs 12 gallons a day. One of those is much easier to start out with than the other.\n\nGoats are also a bit more versatile if you decide milking isn't for you - goat rentals for weed control are a growing business, and all goats produce cashmere (except for angora goats, which produce mohair).",

I believe sheep are similar, which means you aren't limited to chevre or manchego - goat milk cheddar or mozzarella, for example, are delicious, and I had some sheep swiss at a cheese expo a few years ago that was amazing.",

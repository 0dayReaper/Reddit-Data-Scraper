            "comment": "Short story.\n\nMy neighbors are pastors, well travelled and very lovely people. Having grown up on a farm, one of them, Jane, enjoys visiting our garden from time to time.\n\nAfter it became legal to grow, we put in two cannabis plants. On one of her visits Jane remarked at how unique and large our plants were before asking my wife what they were. Trying to be discreet, my wife replied \"They're a special herb, you know, Jamaican Basil, wink, wink\". Jane comments how nice they look and moves on.\n\nTwo days later her husband, John, comes over, saying he has a hilarious story.\n\nI guess the two of them went out shopping and Jane spent a time looking through the herb section trying to locate the elusive Jamaican Basil she'd seen in our garden so she could \"try it out before growing it, the plants are very large\". Apparently John couldn't breathe he was laughing so hard, he had to explain to his very innocent wife, that we were growing cannabis and you don't get it at the grocery store.\n\nShortly thereafter the two of them travelled to Jamaica for a vacation. Jane returned with a gift for us, a little grinder with a pot leaf on it. Her note said *Saw this \"herbal\" extractor and thought of you*\n\nAnd that's the story of how my wife got a pastor to buy drug paraphernalia.",

            "comment": "Even if you tell each other privately, it\u2019s well\r\nAlthough Trump's lawsuit will come to the highest federal court, But Trump is likely to fail in the next link, just like every time human beings are destroyed by China in the global Chinese clamor. This time, China would rather abandon Xi Jinping in order to protect Chinese Americans! Chinese Americans are doing not enough, which is equivalent to doing the opposite, They haven\u2019t said how Chinese all over the world killed all Americans. \r\nSo truly rely on open system and Western people that is our principles, we need to do armed struggles. The premise of armed struggle is \"the people know the true crime of China.\"  We can only rely on Western people, not Asians and people of color.\r\nEven if the white people only tell each other privately!\r\n\r\n\r\nTrump's lawsuit failed in Pennsylvania\r\nThis shows that there is no judge this profession in the US, the entire United States has been fully controlled by brain control! Even the rats were scurrying around the street with people wearing rat's heads, this is the Brain-control technology. In fact, the kitchen of the citizens were destroyed by Chinese, not the rats. In order to harm the US, China has new way every day, fire, shooting, \"floyd\", 737max, coronary virus, gay, climate, feminist ...\r\nOnly by eliminating brain control can Americans stop being slaves. \r\n\r\nIran nuclear scientist was killed\r\nIn fact, this murder was done by China, In order to bring the goal of the war to Iran, not China. This was done by Brain Control, Mossad can't go to Iran to attack Iranian scientists, which can not prevent Iran's nuclear research. Trump's reaction to this, because it is beneficial to Trump's re-election, so small Trump's military power. Like \u201dSoleimani\u201d, it only increase hatred.\r\nThis indicates that Biden is a anti-revolution completely, the people can't have any fantasy for him.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter killed Maradona, China took another step toward its goal\r\nOnce again, there was a public murder, and only Trumps were still disobedient. HumanHuman only had a few decades when they had image materials and no brain control. Now only relying on brain-controlled cannibalism to become a star, no arts, no civilization in the world. In contemporary technology, human will never have freedom, and be put in \u201cmatrix\u201d by China and connected to a computer to live a lifetime in a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy is Biden wrong?\r\nNot say:he helped China kill all American people; Surrendered to China; changing the world to brain control; exterminating human civilization\u2026\u2026\r\nOnly say he contact with China: You married a wife. She is wanting to kill you every day, wants to put poison in your bowl, you still eat his food every day yet, She wants to kill you with a knife every night, You are still sleeping on the same bed with her.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy did the Chinese suddenly become good?\r\nSuddenly U.S. Chinese support Trump, opposes election fraud. Even the Chinese do not know why the Chinese democracy activists have become good people? Because they intend to abandon exaggerating Biden, his crazy fraud is easily exposed! China wants to turn criminals into aristocrats and rulers. All U.S. Chinese killed all western people! China wants to create another victory like the independence of Taiwan, the democratic movement, and East Turkistan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me\r\n\uff08Therefore, for 20 years, all world'politics have been led by Tianjin\u201dzhi bu sheng huo\u201dmagazine where I worked. Now Zhang Tianying,police Cui,police Zhang Yi and Tianjin police officers are killing Amy Coney Barrett Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court by brand -control! Please inform her.\uff09\r\n  China has ruined me, so ruling the world. For more than 20 years, China has destroyed me and destroyed the bodies of stars, elites and politicians all over the world. China has also controlled brain control personnel around the world, stealing technology, controlling political parties, and ruling the world!\r\n  I have been maimed by China for the rest of my life. I didn't know anything before and didn't know China's brain control technology.\r\n  Among them, all my relatives did a lot of bad things, they destroyed all humanity!\r\n  People of justice all over the world have been helping me, but China\u2019s aggression has made them extremely dangerous. I still want to fight for this world\uff01\r\n  China has cut off my genitals, muscles, organs, bones, and brain. China does not allow me to have work, money, wife, relatives, or friends. Almost all people in China are involved in killing my mother.\r\n  If I return to China, I think I will die soon, in a prison or mental hospital.\r\n  My father and all my relatives are the most direct killers who killed my mother, me, my sister and the people of the world!\r\n  China ruined all my money and health. OnlyOnly after this\uff0c China told me some truths. I didn't know about brain control before.\r\n  I knew things lately, Maybe Americans have gone bad\uff01So I should go to the United States earlier, But I am blocked by China.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly rely on the guns\r\nElection fraud and unfair medias alone indicate that U.S. is undergoing a coup. The coup is not only against the president, but also against the people. Only people and guns can re-put justice into the system!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe upper people can never rely on elections\r\nChina has done a lot of bad things in the US by rogues and democratic party, The US has been perished. Now Illiterate housewives lead the country, Traitors are killing the people and became presidential candidates.\r\nFor example immigrant population, because of the democratic system, the US has become a Low-level country. In theory, the upper people can never win.\r\nAmerica is no longer America. \r\n\r\n\r\nwill be only massacre in U.S.\r\nWill be from Pearl Harbor to Auschwitz, Will not just Brain-control wave guns.\r\nTrump will be put into prisons; Artistic theory will be publicly modified; thus, the real athletes will be put into mental hospitals, and the real artists will be killed. All strong people will be negatived, and be killed. All things immediately.\r\nBecause China and the US Democratic Party want a Brain-control world, they only need to do one thing----to kill all good people!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe election is completely controlled by the Brain-control\r\nAlthough some good people are Brain-control player.\r\nBrain-control player:\u201d In order to find and kill the good people, China deliberately made Trump win in 2016.\u201d In a sentence, I understood all things! The names of the states and the results of the votes show that the brain control completely controls the election results. So we got all the correct explanations: Why did Trump announce victory, stoping counting, to sue? Why did U.S. Chinese support Trump? In recent years, all the world things were inorder to lure good people, find and kill them. So Trump has tried to do the biggest effort in limited power, he can't say brain control, can't launch the war, can't tell people the truth ...... Trump is the only good person.\r\nSo China made shootings and wanted to prevent people from uprising by banning guns. China doesn\u2019t want the Systems, economy, politics, only needs to dominate brain-controls. All brain controllers are low essence. Just kill all good people, China can rule the world! The people don't know this knowledge.\r\nOnly Chinese and Obama do not let me eat, Bidden is not that. So the American people should go to civil war, only need to kill all U.S. Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law theory of Sue in the election\r\nDon't require evidence for Brain-control, The judges should strongly agree with Trump\u2019s prosecution. System'Americans have to fully support Sichuan from justice and all areas. People's uprising, system support, judicial in-depth intervention are right way for Brain-control, Brain-control is no evidences, no in the laws, no public opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s all of this world\r\nIt's brain control. All political, economic, cultural, scientific, social life is directed by brain control, no open systems, only brain-control system.\r\nEvery thing in dark is sinful. Changing body properties by particle beam irradiation, then use different waves to activate various pre-made body, then Get the needed flesh, parts or whole. You are easily \u201cpossessed\" by others with Ubiquitous waves this world. Others can know your thoughts, control your thoughts and behaviors.\r\nHumans only divide into good and bad, the controlled people are good, the controller are bad. No border, no systems, so some questions had answer, China rules the world because it controlled brain controllers all of world.\r\nIt is interesting that the West surrendered China, because politicians are just for a little benefit. The western people are extremely miserable, China's hereditary \"anthropophagy\" system was transplanted to the West, Western flesh, skills, knowledge, ideas, temperament, social status, willpower\u2026\u2026 are all \u201ceaten\u201d, brain control technology can get everything of human by waves.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause this world is a slaughter of the weak people to the strong people\r\nBecause of being led by China, the world\u2019s contradiction is between brain control and non-brain control, that\u2019s a contradiction between the weak people and the strong people too. The Russians are strong and will not be very willing to be ruled by China in the future. All Western people have been killed by China, western countries are so willing, because they are the capitalist system.\r\nBut Russia is not the capitalist system.",

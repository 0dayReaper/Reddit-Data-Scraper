The height being the width of one sheet which is usually one meter or 3 feet for the yanks. One could make a timber frame to increase strength of the planter if desired. Cheap, easy and instant as all the materials can be got locally almost everywhere and should be within the capacity of even the most novice diy'er. Just google 'corrugated veg planter' for more ideas.",

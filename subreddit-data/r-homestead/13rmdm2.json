Use whatever shears you use to cut through the spine of adult birds when you butcher. \n\nWhen extremely tiny, some people try to gas them with carbon dioxide in a sealed container, but that's slower.\n\nWhen they're older, exsanguination just like you'd do when harvesting roosters for meat. Decapitation can work on older birds too, but don't cut too close to the skull, and use an implement sharp enough to do the job in a single blow.\n\nWhatever option you choose, consider that covering a bird's face with a dark cloth gets the \"it's night time\" relaxation reaction.",

She's still happy and healthy, and I think she has started laying again.\n\nSo I suggest you isolate your chick with extra care and attention for a while before you make the hard decision. \n\nOnce it is clear that health is declining, the best thing is to cull the animal to prevent future suffering.\n\nSince I'm not up to snapping a neck, I take the easy way out and use my .22\n\nI feel for you, bud.

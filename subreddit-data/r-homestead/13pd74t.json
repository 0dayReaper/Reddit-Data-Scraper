Time and cost to make repairs outweighed the cost to build brand new. While it\u2019s still standing currently, it\u2019s going to collapse this winter bearing the weight of all the snow my property gets.\n\nA few perks of homesteading is cutting costs with ones own labor. From engineering, drafting, construction, and cost of materials I was quoted $35,000 for a similar design. I actually had a lot of fun with my land survey. Learning the engineering math side of construction refreshed my appreciation for what civil engineers do daily.\n\nIm working overnight shifts at work and will be raising this barn during the day. Should take me roughly 1-2months. It\u2019s a 12 post lean-to. 30\u2019 long by 20\u2019wide. High side will have 8\u2019 tall walls, low side is 6\u2019.  Prints I drafted give the roof pitch at 5.71 degrees. But for simplicity Sake: 6 degrees.",

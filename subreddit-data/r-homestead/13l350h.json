Since I also like lots of birds in my yard, I won\u2019t have an outdoor cat. So even though I now kinda freak out walking in the yard at night, I will let Mother Nature do her thang!",

They are not aggressive toward anything they're not trying to eat, and will only bit under the most dire of circumstances. And it doesn't even hurt very much. Still dirty and chance of infection and all that, but it's not something you need to worry about. Now if you're in the south, or anywhere that has copperheads, you DO need to be very careful where you step at night. Especially when cicadas are hatching, the copperheads will lie in wait at the base of an tree (usually pecan or oak) waiting for the little guys to crawl up the bark in order to climb out of their shell and dry out. Copperheads LOVE to eat em.",

Texas Bullsnake is a bit more of a loner, generally, as I remember. I once had one lost in my house for several months. Eventually found him and got him back into his safe place. If you're in the territory of these two guys, mind what I said about copperheads!",

What's also interesting is that if there are two X chromosomes they can be two different colours. Let's not forget that not all genders are strictly XX and XY. Nature throws out some rare combinations.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity I won't mention light coloured cats like grey since that's called diluted and caused by another genetic. Same thing with white as that's lack of colour caused by something else in various ways.\n\nAs most females have two X chromosomes the combinations can be Black Black that results in a black cat. Black Orange that results in a tortie or calico. Or Orange Orange that results in an all orange female.\n\nMales on the other hand only have one X chromosome typically. So theyer either Black or Orange.\n\nJust based on this, since females can express tortie/calico and can only be all orange by being lucky enough to have two orange X chromosomes they already have a less likely chance to be all orange compared to males. Males go 50/50.\n\nNow since getting orange is based on what the parents have, that means if you have an all orange female bred with an orange male they'll probably produce mostly orange kittens.\n\nBut what about male torties? They do exist! And why I said XY for male is 'typical' but not always the case! You'll very very rarely have an intersexed cat that gets XXY that usually is physically built like a male. Since they have two X chromosomes that gives them the chance of being tabby/calico if and only if at least one parent has black and the other has orange to some degree. Sadly most of the time having intersex parts results in infertility for cats.\n\nTldr females are less likely to be all orange than males, but it isn't as rare as people think. Especially if both parents express orange to some degree,that increases the odds.",

Ive gotten a kitten that had this but worse, brought her to the vet and they said its not too bad, just clean her periodically and it should clear up, and it did! Just clean her real well, make sure her play/litter areas are super clean, and wipe away the gunk and clean her face twice or so a day. Took my kitten a bit over a week for the gunk to stop appearing.",

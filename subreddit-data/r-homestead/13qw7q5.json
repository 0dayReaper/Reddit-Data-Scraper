    "postText": "Hi I live in zone 9A with native clay soil, I compost at home and always have a large amount of soiled pine shavings.\n\nIs there anyway I can use old potting soil, add compost and pine shavings and let it sit and make my own potting media for seedlings? \n\nIt just feels incredibly wasteful to buy potting soil every year or so for seedlings especially when the bagged soil Is so much worse than my native clay soil. whenever i google how to make potting soil i\u2019m getting results on buy things like petemoss and vermiculite and a bag of soil and processed compost. \n\nI ideally wanna just have a tote or two of soil so I can make my seedings and maybe put a plant in a pot every now and than.",

            "comment": "Yep. Get some 1/4\" hardware cloth and screen what you've got. \n\nReuse old potting soil with perlite in it, because the perlite never breaks down. \n\nLeave the soiled pine shavings in a pile outside exposed to the elements for a few seasons, and the middle of the pile will break down into a very nice addition to your potting media. Fresh wood is not great in potting mix, although rotten wood from pulpy old logs or decomposing shavings is an excellent peat moss substitute. \n\nIf you pile up your deciduous tree leaves in the fall, by spring the middle of the pile should have rotted down into a nice addition to your potting mix as well. \n\nExplore your site for a source of less clay-heavy topsoil, as well. You want soil that's fluffy and black. Protected areas under anything deciduous are a good bet -- some of the best soil I've ever seen has come from under a 50-year-old bank of blackberry vines that got cleared away. \n\nIf the pine shavings are soiled with animal droppings, having those in the compost mix should meet a lot of the plant nutrition needs. \n\nExperiment with what you've got, and alter your proportions of ingredients until you get a soil that performs the way you want it to.",

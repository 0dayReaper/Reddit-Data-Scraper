Or it could be a combination of things.  They said they had to chop through pine roots, didn't they?  Pine sap is a very thick sticky resinous glue.  But it's also a solvent.  Or at least contains pine oil.  Which is a solvent.  And pine oil is also a strong anti-microbial. So any bacteria or fungi in the soil and in the water that comes in contact of the various molecules from the pine oil, die.  Hence more biofilm from dead organisms/microorganisms. Floating in the tip with the resins, oils, solvents etc from the pine sap.\n\nOr, someone may have spilled oil on the ground, it seeps in, bacteria and stuff break down what they can of the oil and turn it into various petroleum byproducts and stuff.  There ain't no telling entirely what it is or how it got there.  I just know once the algea and stuff starts growing, it should be gone.\n\nAnd before someone comes out of the blue and is like \"bacteria can't break down used motoroil\"....  *rubs temples\"...  if there was a dead body in this body of water you'd see similar oil as the bacteria and fungi breakdown flush and fat and skin into aminoacids, lipids, Omega acids, alcohols, OILS.  \"We can't make anymore oil.  It comes from dinosaurs\"....  someone missed the part in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and never researched how they were able to wrap a shit around a stick, dip it in the water in the catacombs and then use it as a torch...  ir's because the water was actually oils and petroleum byproducts from the decomposition of the bodies in the catacombs and grave yards.\n\"There are species of marine bacteria in several families, including\u00a0Marinobacter, Oceanospiralles, Pseudomonas, and Alkanivorax, that can eat compounds from petroleum as part of their diet.\"https://response.restoration.noaa.gov/about/media/who-thinks-crude-oil-delicious-these-ocean-microbes-do.html#:~:text=There%20are%20species%20of%20marine,as%20part%20of%20their%20diet.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/04/180409144725.htm",

In that case it is almost certainly temporary. Will the pond fill with rainwater later?",

But when soils become anoxic (without oxygen) the microbial community shifts to organisms that are chemotrophic. These microbes use different metabolic processes to survive and (this is where I get hazy) derive energy by oxidizing dissolved iron or manganese in the soil. So, if I'm remembering correctly, you're kinda looking at bacteria poop from bacteria that specialize in anaerobic soils.",

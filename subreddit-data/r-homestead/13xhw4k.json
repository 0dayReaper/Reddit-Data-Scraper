This year though we harvested on Monday earlier this week which means the bees would\u2019ve been getting their pollen from sources other than clover (we have a lot of locust trees around us that have been in bloom) which would yield a lighter colored honey (with a slightly different flavor as well). We had to harvest a bit earlier due to relocating and wanted to make sure the bees had enough space to fill without feeling the need to swarm.",

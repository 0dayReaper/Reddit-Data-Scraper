And the bird just live my fruit, who can blame them right? \n\nAnyone have ideas or resources on ways to protect the fruit? I\u2019ve also tried shiny spinning things on the trees and fake owls but those did absolutely nothing",

Depending on your zone I have found ziplocks cook your fruit with the exception possibly of late season apples who are hard enough to take it.\n\nhttp://www.yourorganzabag-us.com/organza-bag.php\n\nI like the dark olive green ones.\n\n4x6 is fine for apples and similar sized fruit.\n\n6x9 for grapes and BIG apples.  Don't bag grapes until they are turning color because the trapped humidity fosters rot/mildew.\n\nYou will STILL get some some strikes through the mesh but not as much.",

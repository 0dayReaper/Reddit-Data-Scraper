Which is 16 gallons. 16 gallons of water weighs 136lbs.\n\nTrying to push 136lbs of water up roughly 16ft on one 12v solar pump is impossible.\n\nIf you were able to buy 11 solar pumps. Installing them every 40ft. With a the last pump at the top of your 16ft. Maybe, JUST MAYBE it will work.\n\nYou also have to think about your power source. Just because you have a 12v solar panel and pump doesn\u2019t mean you will operate at 12v. You may only get 25 minutes of 11v when the sun is at its highest.\n\nWhat you\u2019re trying to do with what you want to buy is simply not feasible for a cheap price.",

Yes there is 100ft of water in the hose, but you only need to push it up 16ft which is about 6.5lb psi of pressure. \n\nBasically this is more than doable with small dc pump like this\n\nhttps://www.grainger.com/product/3TNJ2?gucid=N:N:PS:Paid:GGL:CSM-2295:4P7A1P:20501231&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwyqWkBhBMEiwAp2yUFsy0aNEd_THK1MRWG4eFoO5Cw_EL2HfEYaDaTno2wEEYmAUCbzLFMRoC7coQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\n\n\nSo how much water are you pumping? Is it on demand(ie you need a shower or to fill a pot) or infrequent but heavy (say pumping a few hundred gallons a couple times a year) in which case you\u2019ll need a higher flow pump with a better duty cycle",

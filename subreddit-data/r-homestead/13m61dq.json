(im not the most fluent in Spanish, however my girlfriend is).\n\nI have relatives currently living there where i can stay for some time. after seeing the impact the recent hurricane had on the island, it made me made realize all the potential so many uncultivated damaged lands really have (especially in puerto rico having so much fertile soil, organic matter, and nonstop growing season).\n\nit also made me sad i haven\u2019t seen many people at all growing food on their plot of land, especially with prices being out of the roof lately! (including culebra and vieques). i see so much potential for agriculture on the island. anyways that\u2019s what i got out of my recent trip there, thanks.",

Things you should know:\n\nEverything costs more there because nearly everything is imported and there's an old US law that is a perfect example of cronyism which limits who can import items. \n\nThere is a substantial property tax break for farms but there might be an acreage minimum to get it. \n\nEven though English is an official language, outside of Rincon and other tourist/expat areas nobody speaks it. \n\nThe island government and bureaucracy is slow, antiquated, and corrupt.\n\nMost rural areas lose water/power service on a regular basis.\n\nGood luck",

My terraces are planted with this cool nitrogen fixer that opens and closes it's leaves when touched and then there's the ice cream bean plants and countless other great nitrogen fixers you can grow unlike here in Montana, on my current homestead, where I can grow lupines, one type of vetch, peas, and clover to fix nitrogen",

I was working for FEMA in 2017 when hurricanes Maria and Irma decimated Puerto Rico. The people I helped had lost everything, their homes, their business, and a few lost family members.",

In general, the smaller the amount of land you have to grow on, the more money and/or energy you have to put in to farm it and the more limited your options are in terms of farm products.  This isn't so much specific to Puerto Rico, but you should really have a business plan in place before you pull the trigger.  How much X can you produce in a given time frame? How much profit will you make selling X in a given market?  How long will it take to turn a profit this way, and how much money do you need to have saved up to reach that point?  Really just basic business concerns but I've got no idea whether the economics of farming this way in Puerto Rico are great or terrible or in between.",

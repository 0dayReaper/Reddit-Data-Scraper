I have noticed coming back to WA that it\u2019s gotten warmer and less rainy than when I was a kid. And actually in this area you\u2019re in the lower mountains so there\u2019s some snow in the winter, not just constant rain. Like I literally look out my window at my mountain and in the late winter it\u2019s covered in snow from about January to March.\n\nThis summer, it\u2019s been consistently low to mid 70s here and sunny for weeks, except for the insane heat wave a couple weeks back. I\u2019ve seen people actually watering their gardens. But there are so many awesome recreational things to do around here- tons of hiking, camping, wildlife. It\u2019s gorgeous all year round.",

    "postText": "So, originally I was gonna move by Thunder Bay in Ontario to my partners mothers house, where they have 92 acres of Shrubland. 200$ a month for everything.\n\nBut now that I am applying for my Meitis stuff (grandma is helping) since we are related to a certain person, me, my brother, father and her are apparently entitled to 99 acres of land each on Manitoba. And my brother and father have 0 interest, saying they will likely give me theirs. So I possibly get tax free land, being 99-297 acres!\n\n\nI plan to do permaculture, try and make a orchard, pasture raise and such as well as breed poultry. Issue is I had never been out of Alberta so I hardly know anything about either areas. What do y\u2019all say? Experiences with one or both areas etc.",

Even places like peguis first Nation have some great sections for grazing and hay making. I'm personally not a fan of T-bay, as it's mostly rocky and full of trees. But of course, it depends on what you are looking to work with.",

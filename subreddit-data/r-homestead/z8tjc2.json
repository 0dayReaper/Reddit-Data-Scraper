I was out playing in my sandbox and my parents were inside, but the dog was watching me so it was okay. The neighbor boys started going up and down the road on 4wheelers and my dog started growling. I ran to the house because it scared me, but my mom let me know she wasn\u2019t growling at me, but at the boys. She just didn\u2019t like what they were doing and was watching out for me. \n\nMy cats were about the same. The cat I\u2019d gotten as a kitten (I was around 4-6 this time, not wholly sure) let me lay my head on him and we would take naps where I would hold onto a paw. \n\nThe only animal I ever felt unsafe or unsure about was dear old Jennifer. I got pecked and clawed and bit, sure, but that was the only time I\u2019d felt that true, primal fear. His \u201cwife\u201d was a sweetheart though. I was her kid.",

Once my mom asked what I said I realized that was in fact NOT the case. \n\nI also stood up on the bench seat at a restaurant after having watched the movie \u201cClick\u201d in theaters and loudly asked my entire family (mom, dad, grandma, and aunt) what a bastard was.

    "postText": "Has anyone used the USDA Guaranteed Loan? I'd like to use this to buy a home with room to homestead to sustain my family. From looking at the basic requirements my partner and I would qualify and pretty much our entire state counts as rural. The only thing that gives me pause is that both our employment history has been rocky with many short gaps and the longest job held for only 7 months. With all other qualifications met, do you think this would prevent us from getting approved? I'm not sure if it matters but we both have documented disabilities that were directly related to the gaps in employment. Our most recent jobs were 7 months which was the duration of the contract and we've since both acquired permanent positions elsewhere. Thanks for any advice you might have.",

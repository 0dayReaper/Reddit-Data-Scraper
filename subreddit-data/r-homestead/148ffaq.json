Get to the burns and look under trees that were singed in the bottom with a bed of needles under them. I noticed the moon scape burn area didn't have nearly as many (I think the moisture in the remaining soil is cooked out too fast by the sun)",

Are morels usually/only found where there were fires? And is it true you can't cultivate the morel like the default mushroom?",

There is a close one called \"elfin sadle\" but don't really look right and none toxic. \nThey glow in most pine forests but something about a burn makes them pop off in high numbers that people camp out and pick for profit ($55c/pound in Vancouver!). To my knowledge no these can't be cultivated but I put all my scraps from clean up in the same area in hopes haha",

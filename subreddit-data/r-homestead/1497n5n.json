    "postText": "I grew up with a decent size herd of dairy goats. We primarily raised Saanens but had a couple Alpines through the years also.  This was 15-20 years ago. Now that my husband and I are moving to some land and can get some animals it seems things have changed in the goat world. What are the benefits of the mini or dwarf breeds vs. a full size dairy goat?",

Less money spent on feed, usually, except winter time depending on where you live. They can produce a large amount of milk for their size and food requirements compared to most other full sized dairy goats. \n\nAlso they\u2019re cute, love getting pets and they enjoy having and being company.",

            "comment": "I breed Nigerian dwarf goats specifically for DAIRY. If you want them to milk, I recommend finding dairy breeders and asking them the same things you would if you were buying a saanen or alpine for milk. \n\nAs to why, the Nigerians are powerhouse milkers when bred right. 1/2 gallon a day is standard for my herd, with some at 3/4. (so 4-6lb per day). They will eat 1/3 of what a nubian does and have the highest butterfat of any breed making their milk taste extremely sweet and non-goaty, as well as providing high yield for cheese making. \n\nAdditionally they are easy to handle, and bucks even in rut are quite easy going and usually max out around 100-110 lbs which is a lot more manageable than a 250lb standard buck. \n\nThe market is quite flooded at the moment but you can expect to still be on a wait list for the good breeders. They are worth the wait.",

They\u2019re small enough to handle easily and keep fenced but their udders are huge. My oldest doe can easily do a gallon a day and her daughter on her first freshen does an easy half a gallon and still feeds her twin bucklings. And that\u2019s just once a day milking. I don\u2019t have much to compare them to but I imagine they eat less than a standard sized doe. Since their legs are shorter I worry and am constantly judging things like udder attachment to make sure they don\u2019t have dragging teats in 5 years but other than that I love how I\u2019m doing it. Hybrid vigor and all that. They\u2019ll never be able to be in shows but they\u2019re super healthy and sturdy. It\u2019s all about good foundation stock imo.",

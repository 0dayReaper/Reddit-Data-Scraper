    "postText": "I would love some good advice. I'm a 43-year-old female who is in a tragic accident. Therefore I have to have some assistance and be close to medical. However at the same time if shtf happens I'm concerned either which way. If I move to a more rural area I'm going to have a hard time getting medical. But if I live in a city that is crowded and shtf happens then I'm also screwed. Does anyone have any advice they could give me in private message about which way to go. I've always wanted to live on a homestead that was self-sufficient. I know with my medical needs I'll have to still have assistance doing most basic tasks but I'm sure that could be worked out. The world is getting crazier. And I would feel peace of mind but it also makes me nervous.",

No deciding between \"bug out\" vs \"bug in\": If you rely on supply chains for legitimate reasons, your best reaction to disasters is to be prepared to relocate to where the supply chains are available. This means that more of preparedness is financial, career/skill/credential-based, etc vs planting food, raising critters, etc. It's basically the same situation as for insulin-dependent diabetics -- if you cannot maintain quality of life without supply chains, you can only survive where the supply chains are. If people with your condition in pre-industrial societies would have died, that's what you're signing up for if you try to pursue a pre-industrial lifestyle. \n\nIf you're physically incapable of the tasks that go into self-sufficiency, moving to the middle of nowhere is all downside with no upside. \n\nIf you happen to have family in the middle of nowhere who would willingly offer the support you need, of course, it becomes a totally different equation.",

I mean, we live 40 miles from the nearest hospital but there are a few rural medical clinics within 20 miles, and urgent care centers within 30 miles, and EMT/fire out here for emergencies. My daughter had quite a few special/medical needs and we just drove to her doctors as needed. \n\nThere are tons of homes that are rural but also still closer than us. Lots of small towns have at least some sort of medical services and just a few miles outside a small town is pretty rural most the time.",

I'm concerned because I will still need home health etc.. In a rural area it will be harder I will have to find people to help me with grocery run in town a couple times a month and have to get someone to help around homestead for some of the items I can't lift physically. I feel like I would be safer being a round a loving community than the city but either is a risk but decisions have to be made",

The town is literally just a church, a cafe, a school, a small building that hosts a food pantry, and that's it, No actual retail services whatsoever, but the bus comes here 2 days per week to pick up and drop off people.\n\nIt is harder to find home health professionals but we have some out here and some that were willing to drive for my daughter. Good luck. I hope you find what you need.",

There are definitely states with better medical services than we have so I suspect you could definitely find something suitable especially in a more medically favorable state. I've heard Massachusetts and Minnesota have decent medical care but haven't ever lived there to try it myself.",

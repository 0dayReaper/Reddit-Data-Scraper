    "postText": "I've tried this once before by only placing the fat in a pot and melting it off, but I didn't purify it and it seems to only be good for use on my boots due to the smell.\n\nI'm trying again, this time with the wet method of using water and salt. I always find mixed answers online about the method of doing this and I feel like there's still fat left in the chunks, though they simmered overnight in the pot.\n\nDoes anyone know of a better way to render and purify tallow? My intent is mainly to use it for leather balm, candles, food, and possibly lotion.",

I don't add water or salt or anything, just simmer the fat and filter out the bits with a fine mesh sieve.  Doesn't stink and works perfectly.  The two pounds of fat I cut off a 14 pound strip loin produces about 3/4 quart of tallow.  I've heard of people using the protein bits that end up in the pot for beef soup, later.\n\nI cook with it.",

Once the solids sink to the bottom and fall apart if you poke them with a fork, you have all the fat out.\n\nStrain it through a muslin or cheese cloth and let it set up. The water and salt will be on the bottom and all the fat on the top. You can scrape the bottom of the \"cake\" to get rid of more of the impurities. If it still smells of beef, render it again with salt and water. Most of my batches take between two and four renders to not smell of beef and have minimal to no impurities floating on the bottom of the cake.  \n\n\nWhy salt? Salt is not fat soluble so it won't hang out in the finished tallow. However, it will bind to the impurities and help them sink into the water to be poured off.",

There should be no sizzling when tallow or lard is put into a hot pan to ise in cooking. \n\nPeople wrongly think the whole point is to remove the fat from the gristle. \n\nIt is deeply important to remove the water from the fat as well. If the fat still has a milkiness to it, then water remains. \n\nIt is clear when the water is gone as the fat becomes completely transparent, not just translucent. And the cracklings fully brown. The water having been cooked out allows for the crackings to fully brown. \n\nI grind my fat and press it into a wide shallow pan. You want the most surface area you can get. I put it in the oven at 225\u00b0f until it is complete. With using the over method there is no risk of the water softening the collagen then it sticking to the bottom of the pan as can easily happen on the stovetop. Cook it until it's fully transparent.\n\nEdit to add: particularly since you are wishing to make candles, you must cook all the water out. You won't be able to get an even burn with your candles without cooking out all the water. I've known many people who tried tallow candles who swore them off because they didn't burn clean. There whole reason they didn't work was remaining moisture in the fat.",

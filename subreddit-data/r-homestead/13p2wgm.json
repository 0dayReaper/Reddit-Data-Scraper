    "postText": "Learning to homestead with what we have, renting, but our landlords are pretty chill, we live in (6b, 7) depending on who you talk to in East Kentucky. First pictures were 3 weeks ago, last 2 are now for the garden and the beginning of an addition to the chicken coop to give the girls more room since I can\u2019t let them out yet. They\u2019re all around 5-6 weeks old, think we may have gotten one Roo, a Golden Wyandotte. Only time will tell and I\u2019ll decide what to do with him if so, my aunt has a farm with lots of animals so that could be an option.",

But yeah, I certainly would have preferred a brooder plate to a stuffed ducky and that lamp.",

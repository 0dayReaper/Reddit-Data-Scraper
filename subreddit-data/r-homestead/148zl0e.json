I posted it because I find it interesting that the white eggs are about 1/5 the cost of the organic brown eggs. Since many homesteaders raise chickens I thought many here might find it interesting too.\n\nThe price disparity is pretty stark, and I suspect that homestead raised organic brown eggs are even more expensive.",

They helped build the coops and love naming the chickens and seeing their different personalities. Had a baby chick die and an older chicken get sick and die recently, and they were sad for a bit, but got to help bury them and made a nice little grave. Seems to me like an easier way to learn about and process death than most. We don't make the kids work much to keep the chickens yet, but we are thinking of selling eggs soon and if the kids want to get the profit they will have the option to do the work. We're not planning to make any money from it, certainly never going to recoup the thousands we spent on coops and runs. The higher egg quality is also nice (big, dark yolks). They make tastier souffles.",

The $2.50/dozen eggs have weak shells, weak, pale yolks, and most likely come from battery hens that are kept in deplorable conditions where they can\u2019t even hardly move for their entire life and are fed the cheapest corn and soybeans money can buy. I don\u2019t wish to support the treatment of animals in this way any more than I have to. The eggs that come from my chickens have strong shells, rich yellow-orange yolks, and the chickens themselves have a pleasant life in a large outdoor run and eat very healthy soy-free food that I make myself.  Eggs that come from chickens treated similarly are about $5/dozen. It is worth every penny.",

If that sort of thing doesn\u2019t bother you, and cost is your number one concern, you probably won\u2019t save any money at all raising anything yourself.

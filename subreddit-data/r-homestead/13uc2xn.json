    "postText": "I moved to Canada last year and we just bought a house and my husband wants to make the backyard into a big veggie garden. It\u2019s a one-story house though and now I\u2019m wondering how people store their produce here in North America, as so many houses seemingly don\u2019t have basements? \n\nAt home I had a basement (as does everyone, even apartments have a basement-cell there) which stayed fairly cool throughout the year and knotted onions that I hung up in fall stayed good well into spring/early summer. Same with potatoes, as long as I stored them correctly, they didn\u2019t go bad. I\u2019m worried that this won\u2019t work if I just store them in the kitchen, as I notice that produce my MIL buys and stores in her kitchen spoils real quick. Any solutions for this? \n\nI know it\u2019s not an immediate problem and rather a next year\u2019s problem, but I want to be prepared. Thank you for suggestions!",

            "comment": "You can make a mini root cellar by digging a hole and burying a steel garbage can or something similar. Put drainage holes in the bottom, a vent at the top, then cover it with straw to insulate the top. Add layers of straw or sawdust inside alternating with your produce. Works pretty well for potatoes and root vegetables, not really for onions tho because they need a dry environment. Also, don't put anything that was bruised or damaged in there as they will rot faster, and you wanna check it regularly to see if anything is rotting.",

They won't have quite the life they would in a root cellar.  The other vegetables I can or freeze them.",

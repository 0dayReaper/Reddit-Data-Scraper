    "postText": "Weird post, not sure where/who to ask... but want some advice on \"giving back\", story could be graphic, not sure but here goes...\n\nI've been feeding some roosters/baby chicks (not mine but they always come to my yard), I put a little old cat house I had in my yard with a little pillow and some food. It's been the cutest dang thing seeing the mom and babies walk around, eat, follow the mother, etc. Well I left for a small vacation for a week, and came back and the cat house and fallen over (strong winds when I was gone) and trapped 3 of the babies and they died (squished). I felt absolutely horrible, nearly cried, I try not to think about it which makes me think about it more, sometimes keeps me up at night, etc. I know it's just nature, and they could have died any other way (they cross the street with their mom multiple times a day and have never been hit by a car and I live on a main/busy road), but something about just seeing them there, the aftermath, something I did (not intentionally obviously) just eats me up inside.\n\nSo I feel the need to somehow make up for this, anyone have any recommendations? Like can I rescue some baby chicks, can I raise some on my own? Is it a lot of upkeep to buy a chicken house and raise some chickens? I know nothing of farming/homestead but can learn if it's easy. Maybe donate somewhere? I dunno, I just feel in my mind I need to balance the universe somehow and make this right :|",

Oh, and chemically nuke every other plant species but the genetically manipulated one the corporations contracts the farmer to plant. Participate with reality - we were meant to coexist with animals, which includes eating them, not to mechanistically bend the earth to our will, pulverizing the grassland and straightening rivers for shipping and pumping them dry to grow almonds in the desert, while the poisoned soil flows out into the ocean causing fish kills and disrupting another ecosystem.",

The world balances itself out in these ways and it may have just been showing you that nature does it\u2019s thing. Yeah things die but also we have no need to provide extra accommodation to animals that aren\u2019t our pets. Idk if these were wild chickens or if they may have been a neighbors but just don\u2019t interfere from now on. Just learn to observe. I wish I could take away the guilt you must have but use that energy to fuel yourself in another way.",

Just do a spray in the evening. If not you\u2019re lacking plant food. I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re located but it\u2019s summer here and they need a lot of nitrogen early on to grow. You\u2019ll know you have given it too much feed when the outer leaves burn and turn crispy",

If you determine that is what it is, you'll need to figure out which kind and treat accordingly. They make commercial fungicides that are effective but are certainly not \"organic\" if that is what you're looking for. Not sure about how to get rid of the parasitic type.",

    "postText": "Would you like to learn how to raise pastured chickens? \n\nMy wife and I would like to invite you to an 8 week course we\u2019re hosting on raising pastured broiler chickens here in Brighton, Colorado!\n\nLast year we raised 50 chickens that fed us and our friends for 11 months. This year, we\u2019ve decided to raise more chickens and host a co-op course that allows local families to be part of the process. This is a great chance to teach the whole family where our food comes from and how you can raise chickens yourself. \n\nMy wife and I are excited to host this course and share with others the tools to centralize local food growth. The average piece of food travels 1,500 miles before reaching your dinner plate. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s sustainable, and we want to help spread the knowledge on how to change that. \n\nJoin us this summer and make food local again! Deadline to sign up is 8 June 2023\n\nFor information on how to join, check out the course information sheet we created here!: \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1RZ51h5-ZUUxo_MiTvd_K-7lQuJC6OKM-Smvna4DjqlU/edit?usp=drivesdk",

    "postText": "I've been loosely researching rain water collection over the years but the time has come to design the actual system and I was wondering if anyone here had any advice.  My rainwater collection will take place on a simple pole barn structure with a metal roof that is 60ft (W and E facing) x 35ft (N and S facing) with gutters and downspouts at all four corners.  The rough plan is to run the two southern downspouts at a decent angle to the northern corners where I'll have two large first flow diverters before getting to whatever tank system I decide on.  I could have the tanks outside this building on the shady north side or I could keep them inside as the foundation is gravel pad.  I was originally planning on keeping the tanks up high where I'd have about 15ft of head to my garden and use this pressure to feed some drip lines.  The garden plans have expanded though and now I'm leaning towards setting up a pressurized well tank that I'll keep inside the structure and run back out to the garden.  I'd like to bury a pressurized line with a few external freestanding spigots but might settle for a single spigot on the outside of the rainwater collection structure and use a hose get the water around the garden area. \n\nIf anyone has any experience or second hand knowledge with rain water collection and has any thoughts or comments on my rough plan please let me know.  I'm looking for every opportunity possible to avoid making mistakes.",

            "comment": "By chance I have a very similar system.  Pole shed with metal 60x20\u2019 roof.  3 tanks, 3500 us gal each.  Tanks fill in series.  Overflow from one goes to two\u2026 two goes to three.  All three tanks connected via ball valves and lines at the base.  They feed a 3/4 hp jet pump, and then parallel pressure tanks.  About 50gal of total pressure tank capacity.  This drives water out to a small garden and orchard.  Some learning:\n1.  Don\u2019t just drain the lines in winter, drain the pump too.  Cracked a nice pump in the first year.  2. We wanted to do gravity too.  But reality is you need more height than you think, and drip emitters need a certain amount of pressure to function properly.  So a pump is needed.  3.  10,000gal doesn\u2019t last as long as you\u2019d think.  You need a lot of tank capacity.  Do some estimates of your need before you buy.  4. Using black, closed tanks means no mosquito and no algae.  5. Screen the water before the tanks.  6.  You don\u2019t need a pre flush.  7.  If you do drip irrigation you need to filter.  If not, I wouldn\u2019t bother filtering.  Jet pump won\u2019t care at all about a bit of dirt in the water.  It\u2019ll mostly settle out in the tanks anyway.  Pressure tanks don\u2019t have an issue with a bit of dirt either.  Note that all houses on a well will have filter system after the pressure tank\u2026 not before.",

I was thinking three 1500 gal tanks but your comment on 10k not being enough has me reconsidering.  Most of my fruiting trees are going to be on swales but that doesn't mean much when it hasn't rained in over a month.",

Tanks have not frozen, but I did crack lines, valves, pump, till I learned how to drain fully.  We have about 80 shrubs, a dozen fruit trees, and a small garden.  The water goes fast with this dry weather.  We need to irrigate about 100 days of the year.  10k gal works out to only about a gal per plant per day.  Not a lot, especially when the larger fruit trees develop.",

            "comment": "Well pressure tanks and the pumps that fill them are designed for clean well water. If your roof water has any chance to grow bugs or algae, those can mess with a pressure tank, and you'd want to strain it before the pump to the pressure tank. \n\nI personally like having some tanks on a level where the roof gravity feeds to them, and other tanks on a level where they gravity feed to the garden. I pump from the lower tanks to the higher ones when necessary. It's nice being able to water without depending on electricity being available at watering time. \n\nWhen considering buried plumbing with spigots, think about any frost you might get. Water freezing in a spigot is bad times. You can insulate them or drain the system during freezing temperatures if you plan for that, but do plan for that.",

Can be a bit of a pita if your barrels run low or keeping them fed enough though. \n\nI was in a very humid area at the time and mosquitoes were everywhere.",

You should be OK just having downspout filters to catch large debris and flush your holding tank before winter\n I'm guessing since it was for the garden, you planned on emptying it before winter anyway.",

One tank has a hose bib to garden hose to a jet pump and garden hose to the gardens. The hoses are mostly buried in the weeds so, I made a Shaeder valve to screw on the end to blow it out for the winter.\n\nI started with gravity feed, the tanks are 15 feet up. Little pressure at 150 feet. That's when I added the old jet pump.",

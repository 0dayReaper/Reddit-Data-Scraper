    "postText": "I have some neighbors who live down the road across from me who seem to have an irrepressible desire to routinely drive to the top of their road and idle, for 20-30 min at a time, staring at my house. I've planted various trees as a hedge along that perimeter which will take a few years to mature to a real privacy screen, but in the meantime I'd really like to just give them a fence to look at instead of whatever chores I'm doing in my front yard. Has anyone done a quick woven/wattle style fence, maybe with t-posts and wire, or a more traditional approach? I don't have the budget for anything like a stockade fence and honestly hate to buy anything single use like that anyway, when I have a huge abundance of green and downed wood around here that I'd like to repurpose. I'm pretty new to everything so it needs to be technically simple and cheap. Would love any tips or experiences! I really only need about 50 feet and even 25 would make a huge difference. TIA!",

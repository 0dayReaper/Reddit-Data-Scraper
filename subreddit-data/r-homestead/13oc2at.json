    "postText": "Howdy folks. \n\nI just bought a great piece on land,  on 8 acres in Canada. Zone 5b. Can anyone suggests resources where I can learn best practices for clearing wooded areas?  I would also need tips to prepare for growing season next year. \n\nReally looking forward to this new life. I\u2019ve spent my whole life in the suburbs\nThanks",

Spend a lot of your time sharpening, you\u2019ll thank me later. Maybe add a shovel too. Be adaptive and multipurpose with anything you already have. Figure out how to put to use the things you clear out too.",

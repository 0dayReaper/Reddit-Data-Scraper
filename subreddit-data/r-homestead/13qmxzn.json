            "comment": "Any egg you don't know the age of should get the float test before you cook it. If it floats, it's started decomposing. \n\nAny egg that might have been partially incubated should get candled before you break it, unless you want to risk a nasty partially-formed-baby-chicken surprise. If you see no dark spots on candling, the worst surprise you'll get might be a few veins. \n\nAny egg that's been re-warmed to chicken temperature after it has cooled to ambient temperature should be cracked in a bowl before cooking with it, IMO. Make sure the smell and texture are good for what you want before you use it. Warmth changes the consistency of the white and yolk and they can become pretty unappetizing. Some eggs might be fine for baking with but not great for frying, for instance.\n\nThe nice thing about eggs is that time is mostly irrelevant. What matters is how an egg performs on the tests that you do to it if you're in doubt about whether it's fresh.",

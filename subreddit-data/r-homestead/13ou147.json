Once I get my savings built up a bit more I am planning on buying 5-15 acres in Alabama and either putting a yurt on the land or building a small house.\n\nI want to be connected to the electrical grid and local water and internet if possible while also eventually installing solar and water catchment to slowly rely on the grid less and less.\n\nI will be working a full time job for at least the next 5-10 years so the Initial plan is to just get setup comfortably out there, but eventually start doing things like Planting fruit trees, and generally growing food, and possibly animals if I feel like I can handle the responsibility.  \n\nDefinitely don\u2019t want to bite off more than I can chew, but am thinking a slow and steady approach whilst maintaining a solid income from my job will be a good way to get started.\n\n\nAnyone got any thoughts advice or insights on this?  Any feedback is highly appreciated! \ud83c\udf7b",

Has been slow going while still working full time, but I never thought I'd have the opportunity to live like this until I was too old to do all the hard work. Can't beat taking a lunch break to go check on the chickens and do a little weeding in the garden. \n\nI'm not sure I'd be enjoying it as much if i were off grid or in a yurt though, lol.",

I've felt so much better than I did when I spent an hour and a half commuting just to sit at a desk doing what I can right here.  \n\nA lot of companies in this area are starting to force workers back in the office, largely because they have leased all this office space and because local businesses are missing the income of the workers.  But I don't think they really understand that many of the \"still remote\" people have drastically redefined what they consider to be a good quality of life.",

I have definitely heard they can be a bit much to manage, especially given the humidity we have In the south leading to mold, as well as a few other things that make it a bit less ideal than a standard house.\n\nAlso worried about strong Alabama storms messing up the yurt.  \n\nBut maybe if I actually save my money properly this year, I could afford some land that already has a house on it out in the country.  I think that would be the best bet.\n\n\n\nAnd yeah it sounds amazing to just live out in the peaceful country and slowly work with nature to build out things like food production and water catchment.\n\nDefinitely not going fully off grid lol - need fast internet and reliable water and electricity waaaaay too much.  Thanks for the Insight!",

Our area sees 70mph a few times a year with gusts as high as 95.  When I bought this tent (not my first choice but supply chain forced our hand) they said it could handle high winds.  I disagree.  lol.  But they also wouldn't give a number it was rated to.  So just be careful when you go shopping for a yurt and make sure it's either rated for your area or they have a good return policy.\n\nWe're kiiiiiiiiiind of doing what you describe.  Living out of a (better brand, now) tent when we're on the property but striking that and heading 6 hours back home in between time we spend working and during winter when it's too cold up at 6000ft to be living out of a tent.  A yurt would be more do-able but hubby wanted to keep his job for the time being and this is working-for now.  There's talk of change but that's more displeasure with his job than any issues with our current setup.",

It's a cabin, though, not a tent.  My electricity never goes out, as I have complete control.  Worse case, you might have to fire up a generator if it is cloudy for a long time, but that is in my control.  If in a town and it goes out, it's not nearly as easy to get things going again.  You just need to find the right spot, and put the work in.\n\nCheck it out:  [https://offgridcto.com](https://offgridcto.com)\n\nNote that in the blog posts I have upgraded to Starlink since viasat, and that has made things both cheaper and faster.\n\nWe are slowly working on the food thing and such, but have to concentrate on some beetle kill and infrastructure first and have been picking at it.  Nothing like being able to step out and look at the mountain after a long meeting...",

Once my 2 year contract was up, I switched to T-Mobile. They don't have an unlimited package in my area (can't figure out why), so I go over my data sometimes. THAT SUCKS. It sucks less than trying to connect to a Zoom on a cloudy day via satellite internet, but still......\n\nIf wfh is important to you, check which internet providers are in your target area. Get *specific* down to the address, not just the zip code. I made that mistake by checking the website for AT&amp;T and them saying yeah we service that area. Ha ha haaaaa no they don't have internet on my road. In town, yes. Outside of town limits, no. \n\nVerizon and Sprint cell reception was awful, so we had to switch to AT&amp;T. You read that correctly; AT&amp;T had cell service, but not internet for my house. Sighhhhhhh.....\n\n***TLDR***: get your internet and cell service sorted before you commit to wfh in the middle of nowhere.",

I had been wanting to sell and get something more rural with more land, but once the pandemic hit it was not financially feasible to do so.\n\nSo, I started looking at what I already had and how I could make it work better for me.  I started building out some garden spaces and a compost pile, and learning what I can about vegetable and fruit gardening and preserving as I go.  At this point the long term plan is to make progress every year in becoming more self sufficient, and reducing my negative footprint along the way.  I plan to continue working in some fashion for the foreseeable future, but have a job that is computer based and can be done from home.\n\nIt's probably a bit laughable to those really living off grid and are fully self sufficient, though.",

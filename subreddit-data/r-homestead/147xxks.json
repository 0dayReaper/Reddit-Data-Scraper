Check with your local state ag office as to how much livestock of which kind, you can have on X acres without supplemental feeding/watering in the area you are thinking of. On our Montana property, it's 21 acres PER cow/calf pair. On our Arizona property, it's 40 acres.",

This lifestyle certainly doesnt offer any and it certainly isn\u2019t cheap. \n\nIt will probably take a few years but if you work hard and dont get caught up in spending your money on stupid shit you can get there. \n\nI would suggest making a 5 year plan with a few checkpoints, this is what worked for me. Also manage your expectations. You may only be able to afford a lot less acreage than what you originally had in mind, but there are ways to pivot around that. If you set yourself on the right path good things you didn\u2019t expect can help you get there faster or back up to the amount of land you originally wanted.\n\nAlso land loans are typically at least 20% down plus some closing costs. That\u2019s not including a house or a trailer/mobile home. Tractors are around $20k-30k on the lower end too and that doesn\u2019t include diesel or maintenance. Don\u2019t get me started on side by sides and ATV\u2019s. You can get them cheaper but you\u2019ll spend more in maintenance and a lot of time.\n\nBudget about $10k for a well. May be more, may be less depending on where you are. Also requires maintenance.\n\nNow lets talk crops and livestock. That can get expensive fast depending on what you do and what attachments, irrigation, vet bills you need. Think 4-5 figure range.\n\nYou want good internet? Starlink or satellite.\n\nAlso for a lot of things you need a truck and a trailer. Possibly a few different trailers for specific purposes.\n\nMost of these are negotiable to an extent based on what you want to do, but are also needed to meet a certain threshold of efficiency.",

If you happen to be a vet, some states have incentives like 0 down payment or no property taxes.  But really if it were affordable for the middle class anymore, everyone would be doing it.  This is just another dream the middle class is quickly getting priced out of.\n\nI hope you find a way to afford it but if you don't, don't blame yourself.  It's the system.  It's the economy.",

I live about 4 miles off the highway as the crow flies, and I can hear the Harleys and crotch rockets. \n\nWith that said, our town would suffer greatly without tourism. I try to avoid it as much as possible over the weekends, but recognize it's best for the area.",

Once at night we had an suv flipped on it's side out in front of our house on the road, on the steep curve and my husband jumped on the side to help the guy out, and while we were on the phone with 911 another vehicle didn't care about the lack of visibility due to the mf nor'easter and plowed right into that first vehicle, and then we had TWO vehicles on its side. Ended up having a tow truck come and help the other tow truck, which got stuck. Had it all on video, including the cop car having to be pulled out of my driveway because the driveway is also a pretty big steep hill.\n\n  Steep road at the top of the road, drastically declining around an almost entire v-shaped curve right before my house and into my driveway, meaning when they land IN our yard, they have fallen about 15 feet down from the road. Happens so often we have flashlights near the door, specifically so one of us can go to one end and another to the other side so we can flag people down before they get closer to the accident. \n\nAnd man, don't even get me started about all the KIDS, including definitely not even 10 year olds, who fly around on their dirt bikes ALONE WITH NO PARENTS. Yes, I've never seen one without a helmet but lots of dump trucks and vehicles pass this way as we live 2 streets away from a place where folks pull off the road, onto the dirt side and go fishing or hunting or canoing or hang out by the bridge. I absolutely hate seeing the kids and bikers go as fast as they do. Super dangerous on roads like ours that are also filled with skid marks from hundreds of people having to slam on brakes due to wild animals walking across the road.",

Owners redid the campsites around this pond last year. Usually only a few would camp there before. We have had ppl tee off golf balls, shoot fireworks,  drunk walks up to our property after midnight,  ppl at my chicken coops. Usually most we explain that they are on private property and need to leave. Kids watching my chickens doesn't worry me much, but if caught, they are monitored,  spoken to kindly, and walked to the hill. The worst one was a few years ago. Some lady let her dogs off leash, and the mutts came to my yard and had my Bloodhound pup circled while he was on his cable. I went into Drill Sgt. Mode. Asked her to get her dogs before they attacked my pup.  Told her if they did ,we would use force to stop them, 20 gauge  bird shot.She escalated very quickly,  threatening to call the sheriff. Um, they are on my property, and if they attack my dog, me, my guests, or my chickens, I am in my right to do what I need to. I was called a psycho b*tch a few times. Thanks for the compliments! I was by my pup during this keeping mutts back. Hubby came out and shot up in the air, and they ran off. She yelled and screamed more. Hello, there are leash laws for a reason. My son said Damn Mom, i haven't heard that tone in years.  People have also walked up to tell  us to stop shooting clay birds. Ummm, no, we aren't shooting towards you, and you are trespassing.  So go back down the hill. Some ppl are just twats.",

Plenty of drunken dipshits, fireworks and boating accidents. It is what it is I suppose, but I try to take solace in the fact that it\u2019s about 85% peaceful tranquility around here with only brief stints of chaos. \n\nI also try not to let the rare dumb fucks make me jaded towards the regular folks who show up here looking to have a good time and enjoy themselves in a respectful manner. As the stellar reviews of our big resorts and attractions attest to, we pride ourselves in our hospitality to visitors, just please behave yourself and pick up after yourself is all we ask",

So me and my capable brother's incomes and health insurance are 100% tied up in our jobs 1+ hours away. And I fear the youngest brother will want to sell the farm to provide for him and his wife's future, which forces me to buy his share or diminish my dream and solely pay the property taxes, while being far from where I live and unless I buy a reliable vehicle at an exorbitant price. I can't switch jobs because it pays well in relation to other options, and I personally have an expensive-to-manage disease. It's virtually impossible for me to pursue my dream given my situation even though it seems I should be able to on paper. All I can do is enjoy what little I can before things likely evaporate on all fronts. My generation is simply fucked unless they draw the genetic and heir-apparent lotteries simultaneously lol. At present, I'm considering cashing in my retirement accounts and trading retirement for daily happiness. At an expected lifespan of 70 years, why slave away unhappily until 65 before retirement to *begin* my life? Might as well just suffer 5 years instead of 65.",

I refuse to put him in a \"care home\" where abuse or negligence of care is a commonality here.

So, if I relocate abroad and want to maintain ties to family in the US, I'll be taxed in the relocated country *and* the US simultaneously. The US is a slave nation lol. They make it impossible to live here or abroad without making major familial/financial decisions that can ruin you.

My grandparents lived here since I was very small, and we moved out here when I was 11. I have been in this area for well over 25 years and it has changed drastically. These last ten years ESPECIALLY. It used to be a quaint little area of retirees and young families, very quiet and friendly. Now, it has become more developed and more of a \u201cparty\u201d area where no one smiles, waves, or considers their neighbors much. I\u2019m very fortunate my immediate neighbors are WONDERFUL people! However, most of the homes on the lake are not owned by full timers, and sounds really carry across water. \n\nSooo ACTUALLY I knew the ORIGINAL rules quite well. Many have been amended or are often blatantly disregarded, such as noise ordinances or illegal fireworks. However, with a small private police force, and incidents happening at all hours, it is extremely hard for them to enforce the rules.",

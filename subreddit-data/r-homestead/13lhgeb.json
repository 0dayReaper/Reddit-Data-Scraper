            "comment": "It depends on how much land is available to you and what your landlord allows you to do with it. It also depends on how much work you want to put into property you don't own. Also,  if it's just maintenance you're after, all that's needed is to mow down new growth from the cleared land periodically, or use a weed whacker with a brush cutter attachment if that's easier.\n\nIf you're trying to do something with the land, come up with a plan of what you would like and are allowed. A garden? A lawn? Animals? Silvopasture? A combo of some or all the above? Once you figure out what you want, start tackling things in small chunks. You don't have to do everything all at once, and you don't have to get the whole property cleaned up in one go. Pick a project and a small patch of land and start there.\n\nYou also may have less work than you think. Leaf litter is great, it makes excellent compost and the soil underneath should be very fertile. You could clear a small patch by raking some into a compost pile and start a garden (probably plants that like partial sun or shade, judging by the pics). If you want a lawn/pasture, you can do the same but with grass, again taking the small patch clearing/planting approach.\n\nIf allowed animals, chickens love digging in leaf litter and will give you delicious eggs from the worms and bugs they'll find there. Pigs can help with clearing out roots and weeds. Goats will eat the vines faster than you'd expect. \n\nLooking at the pictures, it looks like a great location with a lot of potential. Again, a lot depends on what you want and what you're allowed. Take the time to envision that, list out the steps you'd need to take, and start one small step at a time. We are two years into our small homestead, and even though I had minimal prior experience with things it actually has been pretty smooth getting to where we are now with a garden, fruit trees, chickens, and bees. No project is bad as it seems once you break it up, and each little bit you accomplish builds your confidence.",

I think they hope I'll put down grass seed, but in my experience, grass doesn't like to grow under trees like that.\n\nI'm going to ask about chickens as others have them, but we have tons of stray cats, so I don't know if that will work out. The company was very vague when it came to the yard, nebulous telling me to \"maintain it and try and make it nice\".\n\nI want to be able to just enjoy the forest and give my seven year old a safe place to just be a kid. Due to medical issues, she's never had a chance to before. I love nature and trees and they played an important part of my childhood.\n\nI have a few questions (if you don't mind).\n\nDo I keep the ground cover vines? What about the long sections of thick severed roots that poking out of the ground? Cut them? Try and bury them?",

Clover is also an option, makes a nice green lawn, does well in partial shade, and is useful for pollinators, grazing, and wildlife.\n\nI would probably remove the vines, if you want to be thorough then pull them up by the roots--although it's a lot of work and you'll want to do that in chunks. If you just wanted to open up space, use a weed whacker with a brush cutter blade. For the roots, you could go for burying them. Otherwise, a mattock with a chopping end (not pick) will work to cut them up.\n\nYou can still do chickens even if there are stray cats, as long as they have a secure coop! Cats usually ignore adult chickens but are dangerous for the younger ones. But either way, the first step is feeling in control of your yard space.",

It has  tons of growing things that are vines or trees, or things that were small trees that are trying to grow back. Off to the side, we have an acre or so of forest.\n\nFor years the place was allowed to grow wild, leading to stumps of bushes the lawn mower really doesn't like. We love the place and would appriciate information on how to make it the best it can be. We've already picked up a sizable pile of dead wood and bags upon bags of garbage.\n\nI don't want it to go wild again (snakes in the US south are no joke), but am unsure of what to do. Do I rip up the vines? Let them be to lock the soil in place? What about the long thick (tree?) roots the landlord exposed and chopped up? They are a serious tripping hazard but are still attached to the root system underground. And don't get me started on the inches of accumulated leaf litter in many places.",

Picking up fallen branches can help it look a bit cleaner, but all those accumulated leaves are rocket fuel for your garden. I bet the land is quite rich. \n\nSo to that end, I would not go around and rake up all those leaves and, for example, burn them. Instead, I'd suggest that whatever you do to the land, do it with a mind toward an ecosystem. Bugs live in dead wood and they feed the birds and rodents, who in turn feed the Mighty Patrolers of the Forest, the black rat snake, as well as coyotes etc. A healthy forest ecosystem is, for me, just as beautiful as any manicured spot. \n\nPerhaps go through the land and see if there are any non-native species of plants that should be removed. Be careful messing with root systems. Having a stump ground down beneath the soil line can remove tripping hazards. I'd be much more cautious digging in and trying to remove an entire stump. Plus, there are critters feasting on the dead roots, part of your ecosystem.\n\nOne approach for you may be to pick an area to clear the ground - this is for the garden. And then everything else is managed for the sake of the ecosystem, not you, which means it will look like a forest, not a yard. That's my two cents. My forest was already very healthy when I bought my place, and it is amazing to me every day to see it working in harmony. It's incredible.",

I wouldnt till or do anything at all id just poke holes/post hole dig holes and plop plants right in the ground. Leave the leaf litter as is. Throw out some soaker hoses and put down some generic fertilizer if you want the leafs to melt away faster.",

Support the pollinators and get a healthy crop of fruits with all the pollen exchange. This would probably be the least work overtime- the land would mostly maintain itself.\n\nThen i'd find the sunny places and throw in some raised beds. And if you wanna get chickens you can keep cats (and foxes, etc) away with a well crafted coop!",

Nature wants this are to regrow into forest.  To keep it clear, use weed whacking (or mowing where you can).  Some people use pesticides once a year to control this growth, but I wouldn't with a 7 year old kid.",

But first and secondary education is free, as is children's healthcare, adults healthcare is very cheap, there are so many free attractions (and the government allows free entry one day a month to public works, like castles, abbeys, and other significant sites), and everything is a drive away.\n\nWe bought our farm just before the first crash, I had just turned 20 and my husband 22, and could afford it as we had steady jobs and the place was literally a derelict shell.  We do everything ourselves and grow a lot of our food, so food is cheap, water free, and we cut our own trees to heat the house.  We are living comfortably and have an excellent life/work balance. \n\nI hope I haven't waffled on too much, and answered your question!",

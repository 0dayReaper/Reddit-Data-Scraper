You\u2019re local environment means a lot more than the state you are in. Check things out on the township level rather than the state level.",

            "comment": "Honestly if your looking at those 2 then look at Maine. Property taxes tend to trend lower in most parts of maine and there\u2019s less regulation, especially in the smaller towns away from the coast. It\u2019s very homestead and farming friendly. We actually have food sovereignty laws enshrined in our state constitution as well. I\u2019m in Maine. Moved up here from Georgia(my husband is a Mainer) our carrying costs are super comparable to what we were paying to live is Georgia our bills are just shifted ie: cost to run AC to heating oil.",

            "comment": "Land is definitely cheaper in VT, but as for soil, both states have similar, rocky, acidic soil.  Another thing to look into is how you plan to sell your crops.  If you're going the famer's market route, NH probably has a better market thanks to more, larger cities and more rich people from MA.",

    "postText": "Ever notice the ugly dark yellow color of homestead raised eggs?  The main factor here is what the hens eat, and what they are eating is nasty!  Homestead hens tend to eat a lot of things that good factory raised hens don't get exposed to.  I have seen them tear up and fight over a mouse they caught in their coop.  They ate it!  Would you eat eggs from a chicken that eats mice?  Yuck!  But that's not the half of it.  Homestead hens eat lots of bugs, spiders, caterpillars, even slugs and worms.  And ticks, they love to eat ticks.  All these nasties they eat become part of the eggs they produce giving them that sickly dark yellow or orange yolk.  And who knows what else they have gotten into, weed seeds from plants killed with herbicide? Or something from a brush pile over something toxic a previous homesteaders buried years ago?  And these hens often have eggs with dubious whites that do not run like they should when put in a pan.  Buying eggs at a Farmer's Market is probably a mistake, and eating them could be bad for your health.  Too many unknowns to feed them to your family!\n\nFactory raised eggs on the other hand, have the correct yellow yolk and the whites are healthy and run properly.  The hens are carefully protected in cages and kept from the type of vermin that homestead hens thrive on eating.  The eggs are carefully washed so they don't have hen crap on them, graded, and properly packaged.  If you even touch a homestead raised egg you should wash your hands for health reasons. With factory raised eggs you know what you are getting. You don't have to worry about eating an egg that was produced by a hen that was eating ticks! With homestead you are taking a chance. Is it worth it?  Do you know what the chickens were exposed to and allowed to eat?\n\nDepending on what nasties a homestead hen has eaten, the eggs can have a much stronger flavor than factory eggs.  If they taste different than factory eggs then hens have probably been eating slugs or grubs or something disgusting.  Would you eat a vulture?  Would you eat vulture eggs.  Vultures also have a disgusting diet, most people would not even want to touch them.  Homestead raised chickens are pretty much the same.",

Which is basically every factory egg layer.\n\nI know this is an attempt to troll. You missed out on fruits and veg. You know factory farmed tomatoes will stay green and firm? Factory fruits almost never have a blemish? And they're always familiar every day stuff, not some weirdo heirloom variety that should have been forgotten long ago. Let's stick with the good genetically-engineered products, nutritionally-deprived meat and eggs, preferably boneless skinless with no detectable flavor to get in the way of your recipes.",

Salmonella is always going to be around chickens, but it shouldn't penetrate the egg.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m looking for advice on treating coliform bacteria contamination in an unused well that won\u2019t break the bank? I strictly am looking to use the well to water the garden. The water tested fine for everything except coliform bacteria. I\u2019m considering using a gravity fed filter. Has anyone tried using one on their own well? I suspect the source of contamination to be coming from surrounding horse pasture. Thank you for any advice.",

Many wells share a source and you're getting surface water into your ground water.   The fix for this depends on your geology.   Concrete and or bentonite clay.  Possibly a liner.  How about a UV treatment?  Good luck.",

Those are both things you should be doing anyways. If you're following those best practices, I don't see why having bacteria in the water you put on your garden should matter. \n \nPeople put things with a whole lot more poop bacteria onto their gardens on purpose on a regular basis -- consider manure-based fertilizers and compost tea.",

I have been told that when they drill a new well around here they dump a gallon of bleach into the well, le tit sit for an hour, and then run a pump for a couple of days.  That takes care of all bacteria etc. that may have gotten in during the drilling process.\n\nThen, as others have said, look for obvious leaks around the top of the well where surface water could get in.",

And I do use products with composted manure.\nI\u2019m waiting for results on whether the coliform is ecoli. If so, would the water still be okay to use just for the garden?\nThe well is old and the casing is bent over at ground level so I\u2019d have use a driller to fix.",

If you'd put animal poop on the ground in your garden, you are fine to put water with e coli in it onto the ground in your garden. \n\nIf I was gardening with water known to be contaminated, I'd probably try to set things up with soaker hoses under mulch instead of a hose to water with, because I'm kind of dumb and would probably forget not to wash my hands with the hose if there was a hose in the garden.",

            "comment": "Most types of coliform bacteria are not a problem. After a positive test for total coliform I assume you tested for E. coli and that is the problem?\n\nThe first step should be an inspection to see if there is an obvious source. Surface water could be entering the well if it has a bad seal or even just a low casing. There could be contamination from a nearby leaking septic tank. There could be cracks or open vents that are allowing small varmints to get in. If you can identify a likely source for the E. coli you may be able to solve the problem at its point of origin.\n\nIf as you say the source is surrounding horse pasture -- that is, coming from surface water -- raise your well casing a good foot above ground level and make sure its seal is sound. That should be problem solved. You would also want to chlorine-shock the well.\n\nFiltering will be expensive and require continued maintenance. You're much better off trying to address the source.",

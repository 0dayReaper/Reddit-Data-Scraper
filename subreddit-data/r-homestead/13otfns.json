I think my friends care, but they aren\u2019t invested in the information; they don\u2019t have insight.\n\nI don\u2019t have impeccable social skills. I\u2019ve thought Facebook groups, 4H clubs, farmers markets? \n\nHow did you meet your village?",

Just chatted with them and found out they were doing what we are and invited them over.  \n\nSometimes it\u2019s just opening up and telling others what you do",

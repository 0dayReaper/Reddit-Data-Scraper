Also most of the world eats goat instead of beef. If you've never had a goat burger, you are missing out. I can honestly say it's the best \"burger\" I've ever had. We live on acreage in Missouri, but our particular topography doesn't lend itself to cows and we are trying to be more self-sufficient. We were at the local farmers market and saw ground goat for sale. We bought a pound and made hamburgers. I like hamburgers but don't love them. There are times I crave a goat burger. We are in the process of working towards meat goat production. Have a great day!",

Now, just her presence prevents dogs coming around.",

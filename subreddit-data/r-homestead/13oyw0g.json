Worms don't affect the meat but can affect the overall health of the animal which could affect the meat. \n\nThe hard part is knowing if a lamb has worms. If you know I'd say deworm. Deworming regularly without stool sample confirmed worms is common but up to you I feel.",

If it's causing health issues I will 100% be deworming. \n\nAs far as meat quality, that's kind of what I'm asking. Will parasites or disease be transmitted if they are not dewormed? The customer is my wife and kids, so quality matters a lot lol.",

It won\u2019t hurt to deworm once in awhile and inject them with vitamins and put calcium in their feed here and there. The quality of they meat is a direct reflection of the quality of the animals life which is why usually the animals with the best life are the hardest ones to slaughter but well ultimately taste the best (may sound a little sick, my wife won\u2019t eat our animals for this reason)",

So deworming lambs even when they appear healthy has the effect of preventing infection later on in the season.\n\nI would deworm unless you can take fecal tests regularly to check the infection levels.",

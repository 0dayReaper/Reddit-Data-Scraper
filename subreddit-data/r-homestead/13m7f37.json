If you haven't got a large wooden mallet, I'd use a block of wood temporarily fixed to the top of your post &amp; tackle it with a heavy sledgehammer. If possible. I've done this in the past, a couple load straps crossed over the wooden block, and tacked on the post, buffer block stays in  place, post gets driven in, buffer block gets wrecked, post is still in good condition. I'm guessing it'll take a fair bit of whacking to get it right down...good luck!",

I think he said it takes a couple guys, so they only used it where they absolutely couldn't get a real pounder.",

Sadly I was alone, and my tractors bucket wouldn\u2019t go high enough to drive them from the top\n\nI ended up drilling pilot holes for the nails as well as the stake and it made it a bit easier. Still took a lot of pounding. But not nearly what the one did. Took me like 3 hours to beat the worst one in",

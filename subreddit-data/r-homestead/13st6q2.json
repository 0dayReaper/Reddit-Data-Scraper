(just from looks)\n\nYou could also just do a foundation large enough and anchor the 6x6 or 8x8 posts directly to the baby slab, then build a floating column out of upilaster block, cap it and stone veneer it\n\nEdit: I do stone columns for a day job, usually they're not structural as much as cosmetic. The first description I gave is a structural build, the second one the column is purely aesthetic to the structural integrity",

I have a bunch of stripped logs I haven't gotten to mill yet and saw this design online and thought it looked mighty nice for the outdoor kitchen I've always wanted. I was hoping to get some input on these block foundations if anybody has any experience with em. Like is it a pier and beam type set up with a fancy block around it? Or just a block of concrete set atop the ground? Only really have done pier type and floating type foundations with prior builds. Any and all advice is welcomed. Thanks in advance and have a safe memorial day weekend!",

They will look less like a cartoon drawing of stonework than this contrived awfulness. \n\nIf you want it to be sound and look good, You use mortar to build a hollow \u201cbox\u201d out of your rocks. Back butter and use more smaller stones: build it like mortar is rare and precious: you want to see stone, not mortar. \n\nYou need a wire brush, trowels and a rubber hammer. Start at the bad side and I guarantee your result will look better than this by the time you get to the front.  \n\nNow you have forms for your actual structural support.  \n\nNo need to build wood forms and scab on $20 half-rocks that look stupid and were moved all over the country before getting to you; leave that nonsense for faux- craftsman condos and use local river rock, glacial till or fieldstone.",

It's like being served a drink along with your meal at a restaurant. Eat and then wash down your palate. \n\n\nOne way to help with this is to just get another water trough. That gives your goats yet another source to drink from if the avians insist on using this one. \n\n\nAnother way is to use chicken wire/hardware cloth to create a, \"hoop,\" over the top. Take the wire, put each end on either side of the trough, and then keep the wire bowed upwards so the goats can still get their heads through two sides of the trough. The wire will make the trough more inconvenient to use for avians as it makes it more difficult to access. To add on, if they do decide to use the wire itself as a eating perch, most of the innards and grossness will stay out of the water.",

The ecologist in me also wants to recommend one of each; a bird-friendly trough and a second, guarded trough for the goats, as long as the birds aren't causing too much of a ruckus elsewhere.  Having two will make sure they stay out of the goat trough and they are probably going to be doing more favors for you and your property in the long run (free fertilizer, pest control, etc.).

Less likely to be a falcon since then you'd probably find more bird parts, but an owl or hawk is pretty likely. It could also be a corvid like a crow or raven; they like to dunk and soak their food, and they do eat meat, but they usually dunk with shallow water and I doubt they'd risk losing the whole meal into the bottom of your goat trough. It sounds a lot more like something eating a meal and discarding the less favorable parts.\n\nWhile owls might swallow things whole they'll also often pick it apart (especially if they caught something bigger than they can comfortably swallow). Many raptors don't particularly care for certain parts, and many will specifically discard the digestive tract. Some really favor heads and brains, others don't eat them at all. (I work with one who turns rats inside out, he pulls their whole hide off like a jacket. It's impressive and also disturbing.)\n\nAs far as stopping them from doing it... maybe you could create a more attractive spot for them? I think it's likely the bird is favoring the water because it's a good perching spot (if it's right up against a fence, the bird might be perching on the fence itself rather than the rim of the water trough). If you offer it a different and better spot in the same area it might go for it. Maybe at a higher spot like on top of a different fence post you could nail up a piece of scrap wood for a little platform. They like to have enough room to stand and comfortably hold whatever they hunted while they eat. You could also try putting out a pan full of fairly shallow water (like the big black rubber pans people usually use for feeding grain to horses) and see if the bird goes in to take a bath. They usually love a good bath. \ud83d\ude02 Maybe point a game camera out over the area and see what you can see!",

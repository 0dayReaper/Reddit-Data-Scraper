If you're curious about what happens to the poop after it's been deposited, see the new video by Wesley (a current bootcamp resident) just released!\n\n[Willow Candy Warehouse!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxk50Q9GbWw)\n\nYou can get stuck into tasks like this that help you to develop real-world skills for being self-sufficient and off-grid by joining the [permaculture bootcamp](https://wheaton-labs.com/bootcamp/?f=555).\n\nWhat do you do with your poop???",

    "postText": "The property we bought/inherited last fall had a lot of stuff just laying around, and we\u2019ve used it to the best of our abilities. This coop is built out of old scrap lumber from children\u2019s play sets, fencing, and the cheapest OSB I could find. The primary cost was welded wire fencing (we used 1/2inch on exposed areas), and the aluminum roofing (wow, is that stuff expensive for what it is). The run is for daytime use only, as we have quite a few predators that would sneak in. It ain\u2019t pretty but it works!",

It was a few sheets we got with a gift card. This was last fall that we built - we are hoping it lasts until the end of the year. So far so good, just as ridged as the day we installed. We\u2019ve doubled our household income since then, so we\u2019re going to upgrade the coop at some point and that section will be redone :)",

If I can\u2019t find cheap paint, I\u2019m just going to let it go as far as it will, and then I\u2019ll replace with appropriate lumber and welded wire next year. I\u2019ll keep a section closed off to wind and the cold during winter.",

Then pump to a holding tank that is elevated or up on a stand. From here run pipes from tank to stock water trough. Gravity will feed the trough and a ball cock system will regulate each trough. It\u2019s easy enough to do but but if kicking around. A good idea is to plumb your trough network into your main water feed in case one day the river runs dry you can switch a tap and boom you got water to the animals.",

They're scalable too, so depending on the flow, head, and run involved they can be made really big and provide a lot of water to heads as high as 200ft.",

    "postText": "I had water seeping up from underground at an irrigation line. I dug down and exposed all of fittings. I need help determining what is what and what to replace and with what? The leak was coming from the curb stop (#5 in the picture).\n\nHere\u2019s what I know:\n\n#1 - is a 3/4 PE? Coming from the main property distribution \n#2 - is a metal tee of some sort all 3/4 female threaded\n#3 - metal fitting connected to a 1/2 PE? that goes to an outbuilding\n#4 - 1/2 PE? that goes to an outbuilding (see #3 above)\n#5 - 3/4 curb stop valve? (It had a PVC sleeve and tool to turn off when buried)\n#6 - is a metal tee of some sort all 3/4 female threaded with 1/2 reducers\n#7 - 3/4 PE? Pipe that goes to an abandoned irrigation that will need to be capped as it\u2019s no longer in use and is buried somewhere and and NOT capped off (the valve has been turned off for years as we have no clue where this pipe goes)\n#8 - is a 1/2 metal stand pipe with valve on the end to attach a sprinkler or hose or whatever\n\nAll of this is at least 15 years old and done by a previous owner (owner before the owner we bought from 5 years ago). Nothing seems too badly corroded or rusted out. This rural and will not be done by permits as it\u2019s basically just for irrigation on our 3 acre property. The water pressure is at about 150psi when our water tank is full (gravity fed off grid system).\n\nI have no problems and am completely comfortable and competent to complete the repair. Except I don\u2019t have any \u201cspecialty\u201d plumbing tools.\n\nThanks for any help!",

Make enough moves and I can get water where I want it.  \n\nWith that caveat, if I was tackling this, I would cut number 7.  Then disassemble from 8 backward to 5.  Then examine all the components closely to see what can be salvaged.  \n\nWith only one line going past 5, I don't see the value of having a valve underground.  (Assuming you can drain the system someway to protect from frost, but I am not sure that valve is helping you with frost protection either.)  I would consider putting the value up on number 8 so I could reach the valve above ground.  That is going to require replacing more parts, but you won't have to dig again if it goes bad.  \n\nIf you are okay with moving the valve above ground, I would then ask if number 8 can be moved about 3 inches toward the top of the picture.  If so, you can just use the existing pipe nipple between 5 and 6 to replace everything from  2 to 6.   \n\nI would then replace 6 with a 3/4 inch pipe elbow instead of capping 7.  \n\nAt this point you are ready to reassemble.  \n\nAs far as tools, it looks like you would need a hacksaw (or similar) and two pipe wrenches assuming you don't damage 1,2,3 or 4 during the repair.",

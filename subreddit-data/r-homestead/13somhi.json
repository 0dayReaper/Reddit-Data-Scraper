I am wanting to build a roof over our camper we plan to live in for the next couple of years on the property we just purchased, and i was wondering i could use tulip/yellow poplar or pine trees around the same size as a 6x6 for the supports of the lean to roof? I am also going to use this structure as my rain roof for our rain water harvesting system.",

            "comment": "Not sure from your question if these will be buried in the ground.  If so, I think there is a good chance they will not last the next couple of years.  It will partly depend on the soil conditions at your site.  I have seen pine and yellow poplar rot in 3 years above ground which is less conducive to rot than the soil in my area. \n\n The other thing is that you may need or want this shelter to last longer than your original plan.  \n\nIf you have red cedar or black locust or even honey locust,  they are rot resistant and will last a reasonable amount of time.  Oak will last longer than pine or yellow poplar.  I have seen oak tomato stakes rot in one year but usually they are good for several years.  With you using a larger diameter and in less biological active soil, you might get 10 years out of them.",

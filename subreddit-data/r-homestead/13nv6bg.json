    "postText": "I currently have a flock of 3 that consists of a 1 year old ewe, her ram lamb (2 weeks old) and a 1 year old ram. Since it's a family I am not sure how to go about selling them. I don't think it's a good idea to sell the males only as the ewe would be lonely. Would it be best to sell the 3 at a sale barn or try to make their individual purchases sync up?",

            "comment": "If you want to make the best decision financially and time wise, stop thinking of them as a family. Otherwise you may end up giving them away. People coming to see them will get pretty old when a few have come by, only to leave having purchased nothing. My suggestion? Take what you can at the sale barn and then consider if you want to continue with livestock.",

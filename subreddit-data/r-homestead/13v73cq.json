Managed to sell them for a good price to a solo buyer and that made me went into crazy mode selling everything i had in my attic, full with items from a few years of findings (including one gold ring i've found a long time ago and had saved for a very rainy day) plus things i still find everyday while looking for something that wasn't trivial to invest in since i wasn't expecting to sell that collection for that amount. At all.\n\nThen i've eventually found this piece of land (badly advertised online and still, in my view, very cheap for what it eventually was/is) and uppon visit i secluded the sale. Oficially bought it last friday, in full, and the smile on my face was so great during the boring paperwork and then the almost symbolic shack key delivery by the previous owner that my cheeks started to hurt x)",

Nobody should need to scavenge in the post-scarcity world we live in, except that capitalists won't let that happen.

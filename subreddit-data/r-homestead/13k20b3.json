    "postText": "So context. I live on my grandparents old property. For years they grew stuff out in their field, so they had enough to eat since they've never really had money. \n\nThe problem is over the thirty or so year they used this bit of land I don't think they ever let the soil rest, every year for 30 years they tilled and tilled even if they didn't use that part of the field, on top of the fact that this property is a sand pit (we live South Carolina in a region known as the Sandhills pretty much where the beach was back when T-Rex ran around).\n\nSuffice it to say the ground is not doing very well. We get Bermuda grass, sorrel, and dandelions but almost nothing else grows. I've spent this year setting up compost piles, I'm breeding red wigglers for other parts of the yard, and I've gotten some sorghum sudangras since I figured getting as much biomass into the ground is my best bet. We have a lot of field peas that grow wild all over the place so I've also been collecting and drying those seeds (I've got about 2 lbs of seed from this year).\n\nI haven't planted yet. We have a tiller and plenty of other equipment from back in the day. Would sorghum sudangrass  be able to grow in heavily packed ground or will I need to break the soil first with my hand tiller. Honestly any advice would be appreciated lol",

For the rest of the field I would ask a local farmer to spread cow manure over it and then I would seed it with a diverse pasture blend that includes some natives.\n\nUp front costs are higher on this route but the soil will improve fast and you\u2019ll get a productivity return on your investment for years.",

I meant 6\u201d of wood chips around the perimeter and for pathways between rows of six inches of compost. The wood chips hold the beds together while conditioning the surrounding soil and require no weeding or maintenance (other than adding more woodchips every few years). I dont think its a good idea to mulch annual vegetable beds with woodchips. It\u2019s a good cover for perennials though. I like to use seedless straw or fabric for a vegetable bed cover where appropriate and it doesn\u2019t have to be very thick if you build it this way. The compost itself acts as mulch. The purpose of doing it this way is it significantly reduces weeds. If you till it you will forever be at war with weeds. It\u2019s a vicious cycle that can be ended by burying the seedbank. \n\nThis [guy](https://youtu.be/u79tiVcj8bY) explains the method well but there are many vegetable growers promoting it.",

Buckwheat grows really fast and you get grain out of it too.\n\nAdd a lot of charcoal (biochar) which helps retain nutrients and water. Look up Terra Preta soil. I think charcoal, which you could make yourself from fallen trees and branches, would do wonders for you. You want charcoal, not ash.\n\nIf you have a cow ranch or mushroom farm around try to see if you can pick up a lot of manure or spent mushroom stuff to work into the field. Contact your local 4H for kids raising rabbits. They are often quite willing to get rid of their bags of rabbit manure.\n\nIn the immediate though I would make raised beds for a kitchen garden next to the house.",

I never really worked on it because the HOA rules bar any food producing vegetation that's visible. \n\nGenerally speaking, the fertility is all in the flora above the soil. I've seen 2 approaches. One is raised beds, bringing in top soil and organic matter, etc. The other is to start a regimen of chop n drop, building up over time. \n\nMy neighbors would pour lots of chemical fertilizer to get lawns to grow well. It's hard to keep things growing when it all washes away after a southern style rain.",

Aside from that, no rules apart from typical building codes. These rules are reasonable, for the greater good.",

At this point tillage won\u2019t make your problems any worse. You may need to supplement with nitrogen initially.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a bad starting point.

He told me about his worms and how he makes his own soil with them. Basically feeds works a ton of vegetation and composts everything. People from all over buy worms from him out in the middle of the desert. He turns sand into workable soil. Not sure what all he might add, but I've seen his gardens and it's awesome. Staggs worm farm. Very cool guy just growing stuff in the desert. Maybe worms could help you out? Best of luck!",

Worms in soil without sufficient plant cover leads to compaction.\n\nUse up to 20% worm castings by volume with well composted organic material, tilled deeply into the soil once! (And only once, then never till again) and get cover crops growing. Plants are one of the best ways to get plant available carbon and nitrogen (POMN) into the soil via photosynthesis.\n\nIt'll take a few years, but a rotation of high biomass cover crop, chop and drop, direct till seed and applications of JMS (JADAM microbial solution) will do wonders.\n\nYou'll probably get more useful advice over in no till communities than you will here.

Unless you always have a cover crop, then it's possible for it to wash away with a nasty storm in the first couple of years. The hugel beds take a couple of years before the wood really starts to break down and feed your existing soil. But, the broken down organic matter helps correct your current soil issues! \n\nHonestly, I'd do a combination of both. I would start building hugel beds this summer and then bury them in straw in the fall. That way, you'll have a place to plant a garden next spring that will continue to develop more fertile and healthy soil as it ages!",

Honestly the more chips you can put down the better. Give it a minimum of 6 months but better for a year for the woodchips to start breaking down, creating humus, and the mycelium veins. Then you will till that directly into the soil as deep as you can. For extra help, save any grass clippings, brush, etc and till that in too with the woodchips. Cover again with more woodchips and do it again if you still feel like it\u2019s too sandy like your original video. You\u2019ll have lush soil after the second round guaranteed. \n\nFor general maintenance, keep the paths covered in a minimum 6 inch layer of woodchips. These will continue to break down over time and provide additional organic matter to the soil. You can even consider doing a full till again a couple years down the road. After that though, your land should be good good and you can just continue with adding compost on top each season.",

You actually don't know what type of soil you have because of how dry it is and nobody here should be giving you the type of advice they're giving you based on a video of you running your hands through some soil. \n\nPeople on the internet want to come in here and give you advice very quickly but like there's a lot of information that you potentially need to gather before spending money.\n\nI could probably go to a local college and see if you can bring soil scientist a sample. They might be nice enough just to like do a quick review of it for you but like I had to look at this I can't tell you what type of soil you have it it's too dry. like can you get it wet and then send me a video of what it looks like kind of in your hand, can you squish it around and tell me if it feels like it's like got a lot of silt clay in it or is it like Big Sandy grits in your hand then like what's the percentage of like what you would call organic material in there. then can you tell me how long it takes to dry out. \n\nSoil has four types of components - silt, sand, clay, and organic material. Your soil doesn't look Sandy it actually looks like a silty soil but like it could have a bunch of clay in it but it's kind of hard to tell as it could be pulverized. Like you can grow just fine in a silty or a clay soil and you don't need to do all the amending but people for the most part treat their soil like dirt and don't know shit and think you just need to throw a bunch of shit in it. Soil sciences actually really cool and pretty complex. I wouldn't suggest taking random internet peoples advice unless they ask a lot of questions before giving it.",

Mowing and tilling/turning it into the soil will help change the texture and quality of the soil. You dont have to wait for cover crops.

It will probably take 2-3 years before you can grow well in it but if you can stick with it you will be seeing great results each year afterwards.  Keep adding organic matter to the surface of the soil, don\u2019t till it in again, that\u2019s a one time jump-start for soil like this.\n\nBTW, don\u2019t blame your grandparents for this, they were probably acting with the best knowledge they had at the time, we have just learned more since then.",

Inoculate mulch with winecap mushrooms if you want things speedy (and definitely the sunny areas), oysters if you've got time/shady areas. They will break the mulch down into nutrients for your garden and also (at least the winecaps) will reduce nematodes in the soil. Plus, mushrooms the size of your head everytime it rains! Winecaps are nuts y'all.\n\nIt's best to go no till if you want the mushrooms to stay as doing that will tear up their mycelium, but you can always start you a mushroom bed or beds elsewhere by moving some of the inoculated mulch if you want before you till it.",

Favas are a winter crop, some seed varieties can grow in temps as low as 20F, maybe lower idk. So I planted in winter to take advantage of the free water in our rainy season. They do well even in the least healthy soil. They are a legume, so they fix Nitrogen from the air. After they start to bloom, it is time to chop them down at the base of the plant. Leave the roots in soil. Leave the chopped beanstalks on the ground as a green manure. Rinse, repeat. After three years of this same process as well as adding compost, it is hard to tell that where we started looked like your video. We have that beautiful black soil now!",

No water during that time. Prior there were over 100 head of cattle on it for nearly a year. Absolutely destroyed the soil. So I left it fallow after I purchased (20 acres total, 16 are pasture) once the snow stopped and there wasn\u2019t rain, I burned everything. I mean EVERYTHING. Mostly rye grass and a shitton of dandelions. After a couple good rains, I added a bunch of seasoned cow and horse manure and spread it all over the pasture. Watered and waited. So far I have a little bit of grass. Got a ways to go to make it lush again. Alternatively you could do a one time fertilizer to add nutrients back to the soil if you\u2019re trying to do row crops of some sort\u2026but if you\u2019re doing a personal garden raised beds and add new, fertile soil in the beds and mulch wherever nothings growing. It\u2019ll be a slow process to get it back healthy again. Just have patience!",

Preferably, I would add couple of inches of compost and atleast an of inch of mulch.\n\nNext, I would grow a bush type annual legume. In my case, I grow either cowpea (Vigna ungulata) or mung beans (Vigna radiata) as cover crop, fertility enhancer, and ground cover. When these plants are at the end of their life. Cut back just above the soil surface. Leave as much dead matter on the soil and let the dead roots of the beans to rot underground. After the beans, grow something that has taproot such as sunflower and do the same thing as the beans (let the dead root rot, cut back and leave the dead shoot). You can repeat the process until the soil for you is desirable. Just remember to almost always intercrop with legumes. \n\nJust a tip, to help add energy for the soil microbes, use rice water or any carbohydrate source (mind other minerals such as salt as they can kill the soil) and water the soil with it.\n\nIn watering, I would not recommend the soil to fry up for an extended period of time, otherwise, they will become hydrophobic",

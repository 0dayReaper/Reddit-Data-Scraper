I've been reading heavily on mineral science for my cattle and found that interesting. We've had an uptick in face flies specifically this year which have fewer predators than the other common flies for cattle. I haven't quite figured out supplementation, but your comment interested me enough to share\ud83d\ude02",

I used to go camping with my family all the time and this one campground had water spickets that when you turned them on REAKED of sulfur. Grandparents would make me drink the shit out of it for that reason alone. My parents would refuse and would bring in their own water. I always did have less ticks than them but I have never really thought about it for cattle. \n\nI use the powder though myself all the time around the house and field and it is way better than anything else I\u2019ve tried.",

But I currently have a small herd (jerseys) and am doing majority grassfed with a small dairy feed ration to add garlic powder, kelp, and basic minerals in at the moment. Might just look more into adding sulfur to the mix. My summer project is a mineral bar, but you.know how projects go... Haha. Twice as long and twice as expensive as planned.",

    "postText": "Would it work to get some heavy duty double action bi-swing hinges like they use for saloon doors or restaurant kitchens and use them for a garage or barn?  I have two door openings about 12 ft wide by 9 ft high.  I really like the idea of being able to just walk through or use the bumper of a vehicle to nudge in and have the doors spring back to center.  No clumsy slow motorized garage door openers or reliance on electricity.  Any thoughts?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/falhyff9zb4b1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2df280d507320537aee5ec00d8044a4c3a6a32cc",

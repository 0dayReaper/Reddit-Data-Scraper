    "postText": "If you were to build a extension to a basement to store canned goods and or foods in jars. Would you have to ventilate it? Let\u2019s say temperate is not an issues as it remains 58 Fahrenheit year round. What happens if you let the air go stale with no ventilation? I can not fathom that it would cause sealed foods to go bad faster. Am I right on this assumption?",

            "comment": "Typically you want ventilation as if food does spoil it could trap gases that'll kill you if concentrated. People have died to piles of potatoes in unventilated basements, and the worst part is its never 1 person. You see a loved one lying lifeless and go in to check on them, pass out and die as well. Entire families lost to this.\n\ntldr; ventilate for safety, let alone food keeping concerns.",

Contemplating bunker designs and thought it would be a sealed room that is only accessed once every 6 months. Would be using a respirator upon entry.",

Any room you plan on entering needs either rigorous procedures for actively ventilating it if left sealed, or be passively ventilated. Look up \"enclosed space\" to read more.",

I never thought about the gases from spoiling foods. Makes sense though. I wonder if a independent air source like a oxygen tank on the back or gas mask would be a workaround for the structure flaw. Essentially the structure would not have any form of ventilation possible due to the depth and need of concealment so I am looking for workarounds. I don\u2019t mean to sound argumentative toward you though.",

Open and enter on scuba, place the duct outlet at the back and let it run for an hour or so to be completely safe.\n\nEdit to be completely clear the duct fan&amp;inlet end should be well away in fresh flowing air, outside&amp; above ground to properly displace any built up gas.",

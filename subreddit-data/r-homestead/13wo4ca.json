Buy in bulk now rather than waiting until July and make use of delivery services and your tractor to handle the heavy lifting and probably save money doing so. Work smarter, not harder. Destroying your back won\u2019t do you any good in the long run.",

I will probably be buying it in the bulk 1000lb super sacks or at least by the pallet and using the tractor. Generally just bitching and being lazy right now.",

I just need to redesign the feed room/area so it has better access. I plan on selling most of the pigs as weanlings and feeding out another 8 to 10 to process for friends and family. I can\u2019t make the commitment to go fully selling butcher or butchered hogs. I definitely need to redesign access for a motorized vehicle, especially during the muddy season",

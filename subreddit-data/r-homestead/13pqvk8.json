    "postText": "I just got a new bird dog pup, I've decided that I'm going to let an 1/6 acre of my yard grow to give him training cover. I also have chickens coming in August, and figured that this would be a good opportunity to grow some extra feed in this section. \n\nMy current plan is to let a portion of this section grow prairie grass, and then plant a few rows of flint corn, alfalfa, bicolor sorghum, sunflowers, assorted bush beans, and white clover through the rest of it. I've already planted a 100'x8' section of winter wheat and winter rye. This is in addition to my vegetable garden and orchard (and hopefully will take some deer pressure off of those areas). Does anyone have any other recommendations for layer feed? I'm in zone 4b.",

Yeah, we've had trouble with small scale soybean growing in our food plots, but I am planning to sneak a few rows of my garden bushbeans (pinto, navy, and kidney) for my own consumption. Good deal on the peas! I've got a bunch of leftover seed peas from my garden that I can intercrop with the corn.",

No one who has done it responds. \n\nI'm trying boss, sorghum (white n red), wheat, meal worms, collards, and whatever they scrounge from compost and semi-free ranging. \n\nI'd like to get away from buying feed and just grow/store my own.",

I can afford feed, but I figured why buy it when I have land to grow it.\n\nI'm interested to hear what you're doing for worms. I've considered raising waxxies for fishing bait, but hadn't put any serious thought to it for chicken feed.",

Growing wheat is fun as far as I'm concerned. I've had better performance with winter rye on my ground, but my winter wheat has done well the past two years. I'm pretty busy in the fall, so June/July harvests are very convenient.",

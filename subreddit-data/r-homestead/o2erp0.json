Which is why we can have orchids and pitcher plants up here. With season extenders people already are pulling ripe tomatoes on June 1 up here. Also we have god level plowing. Idk why people think we can\u2019t get around in winter. My road is plowed by 5 am every day and I\u2019m 10 miles from town. The UP is great for homesteaders. I know about 30-40 farms doing it just in my county.",

My dad bought a quarter of \"not quite good enough\" to grow sugar beets land that was perfectly square and no rocks just a bit too sandy.  He paid $600 an acre and he said he was shitting bricks that winter wondering if it was a mistake.  $7 corn could probably pay that off in a year now if the rains and GDUs were right.  The same quarter would sell for 4-7k depending on who showed up to the auction.\n\nCRP land in the east is in a strange spot as well because CRP doesn't pay enough on the current prices but the land is often not that productive or it has serious issues like water (not this year), salt, straight sand, weird shapes, etc.",

While doing this learn about loan programs available for rural properties in the area you want to buy. The USDA does have programs available for buying land and if you have a Farm Credit bank/credit union talk to them. Many traditional banks require full 20% down payments or do not like to loan money for more than 10 acres. We had looked at a ton of properties through the years before everything fell in place so don't be broken hearted when you can't buy the first (or 10th) property you love. It will eventually work out. Good luck and let me know if I can answer anymore questions!",

One house I know burnt as they left a dog bed on the verandah under a window - the bed burnt and caused the window to break, allowing more embers inside.\n\nAnd fires can start days later from embers smoldering under decks, in wall cavities, etc.  Often there's already dried leaves in there waiting to ignite.\n\nGuys who installed my system saw ones fail where poly pipe buried only a few inches underground melted, or burning branches landed on exposed plastic piping.",

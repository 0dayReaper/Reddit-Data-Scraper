If it was a drier year we would get less yield, but same amount of work put into it so it was still fine. \n\nWe had to large of a space to garden the whole thing by hand, and to small of a space for it to be worth getting a tractor. All told we probably devoted around 100-150 sqft to it. \n\nOne year we turned the whole thing into a 6 gallon batch of beer, with the mash becoming chicken treats.\n\nAnother year we turned it into flour, but that was less fun.",

Don't put salt into the hydrated yeast, it kills its effect. Mix it with the flour instead while the yeast starts making bubbles in the water. Don't forget oil (in the dough). You can add things into your bread, onion, spices, herb. That's your taste. \n\n3. Put your preparation at the fridge covered during 48 hours. It's called slow cold fermentation. Really increase the flavour. \n\n4. Please don't eat it with cheap spread lol, savor it with nice homemade jam or good cheese but once again that's your taste, you're free.",

Even on my half white loves I do about 7 minutes, and whole grain would need more to build up the gluten I think. \n\nAnd then giving it a second rise (in the pan before baking it) would help get some loft into the loaf before the heat kills the yeast. \n\nThat was impressive though - you certainly have lots of patience to see this through to the loaf!! I have acres of land and have thought about doing this but I just can\u2019t see it making sense with how much flour we go through.",

The protein content has an enormous effect on the bread produced from your wheat. \n\nFYI for those who want to try what you have done-even if you plant a hard wheat variety that yields high protein your weather patterns and nitrogen levels in your soil will determine whether you get bread flour, soft flour or animal feed.\n\nThis link takes you through when nitrogen is most important and when to apply. You can do it either organically or with chemical fertilizers. \n\n\nhttps://redwheat.com/protein-wheat/",

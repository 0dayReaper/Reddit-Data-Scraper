I do know that in the early 1920s when houses were built in this area, the timber came from old growth forests and not tree farms so the wood is much more dense than the farmed pine studs houses were built with starting in the 1960s or so. The original walls were wood panels but there's now a layer of drywall over it. The place has been remodeled and added onto over the years, but as far as we can tell the original construction was nearly 100% wood - wood frame, wood siding, wood walls, wood floors and ceiling. We frequently find slate tiles when digging in the yard so we think the original roof was slate, it's asphalt shingles now.\n\nI think the biggest fire risk we have right now is that there's still some knob and tube wiring in the upstairs. The entire downstairs electrical was replaced. But we don't really use the upstairs and having that part of the house remodeled is the next big project.\n\nLuckily there's no MDF here and the only plastics are the livingroom furniture upholstry, bed and blankets, and a few rugs. Our kitchen cabinets and various shelves are real wood.\n\nAlso our house is small enough that it doesn't take more than like 5 seconds to get outside from any point in the house. And the windows are very old and very thin, so I can just jump through them and tuck and roll like in an action movie.",

In general solid wood retains its strength for a while, but some older homes basically have a clear channel from the the basement to the roof within the walls. This creates a chimney effect that greatly accelerates the fire.\n\nYou\u2019re probably already doing this, but regardless of construction style it\u2019s a good idea to make sure your fire alarms are adequate and working. If everyone is out of the house when it is on fire it doesn\u2019t really matter how fast it burns.",

The highest average temperature recorded on the unexposed face of the unreinforced straw was 52.8F at thirty minutes. Transmission of heat through the wall did not exceed the allowable limit for any single thermocouple. Additionally, there was no penetration of flames or hot gases through the unre-inforced straw bale wall during the thirty minute test.\n\nThe burning characteristics of the unreinforced straw bales were observed through observation ports during the test. The test panel was also examined after it was removed from the combustion chamber. The straw was observed to burn slowly and the charred material tended to remain in place. The residual charred material appeared to protect the underlying straw from heat and ventilation, thereby delaying combustion.\n\nThe maximum temperature recorded inside the furnace was 1,691F at thirty minutes. Upon removal, the bales did. not burst into flames, but slowly smouldered. The fire was easily extinguished with a small quantity of water.\n\nAfter the unplastered bales passed the 30 minute fire test, plastered bales were tested more closely simulate real-life burning characteristics on finished walls, with the following results:\n\n    The highest temperature recorded on the exterior face of the stuccoed straw bales after 120 minutes of exposure was 63.1F, less than a 10 degree rise in temperature. The highest average furnace temperature recorded during this period was 1,942F, however at least one thermocouple recorded temperatures exceeding 2,000 F. There was no penetration of flames or hot gases through the stuccoed straw bale wall.\n\n\u00a0The burning characteristics of the stuccoed straw bales was also observed. The reaction consisted of initial cracking of the stucco surface as the heat was applied, with little other evidence of distress",

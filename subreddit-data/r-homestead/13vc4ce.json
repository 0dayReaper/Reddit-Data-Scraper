    "postText": "I had a contractor clear out part of a forest, but they didn\u2019t finish the job well and I\u2019m left with very rocky soil and roots. I\u2019m looking to rent something to DIY and looking for advice on the best way to prep the soil. I\u2019d like to remove as much of the large rocks as possible, and till the soil before laying down grass seed. \n\nWould a skid steer and a rock bucket be able to scoop up the rock? Or should I just use a tiller?",

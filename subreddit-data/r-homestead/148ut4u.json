I didn't measure salt that's the thing I didn't follow on video. and I didn't add weight. some videos didn't add weight too so I thought should be fine.\n\nWater didn't cover all the way. then I searched google its ok and it says to add salt water to cover. so I added salt water yesterday and this happened today\n\nis it gone bad already?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9z6q4g8twv5b1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3398148793c7691ebe60680684ced0e71acff6bc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kdaief8twv5b1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6154127ad9b49b8c0e899bb6a42555c95241aacc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7lcl8e8twv5b1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5ccec1dfca89e8e1b13de756d6609c5da0769291\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3iv3qc8twv5b1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5aa4cbe9424921ba2e7d5cf45a4f0b34b13027f1",

And measure your salt because if you don't get the brine right, it affects the fermentation and if the salt is too little, it can rot instead of ferment.  Once you have some successful batches under your belt, you can eyeball it if you like, but just starting out it's best to follow the instructions.",

And as others have said it\u2019s important the brine stays above the veggies. You can use a ziplock back filled with more brine as a weight if you don\u2019t have anything else that\u2019s suitable.",

            "comment": "Well textbook way would be 2% salt by weight, liquid above cabbage, firmly pack the cabbage down, and weigh down cabbage and/or use a vapor lock.  You did none of that lol.  You have to really pound the cabbage and the salt should draw enough water out to cover it all when you pack it down.  Yours is pretty loose and there\u2019s a lot of liquid, if you pack it down tight it would be submerged.  You have to press down firmly and get any air bubbles out (it will produce bubbles later, you need to initially get out all of the air tho) and get the cabbage below the liquid.  If you discard the rotten cabbage and get the rest below the liquid you might save it, but give it enough time.  In my experience if you don\u2019t get the salt right to begin with, you can get some weird results.  Anyway you might check out r/fermenting \n\nI use a ceramic German crock that has a water seal and comes with weights.  Last batch was really good.  You can also get a water lock lid for your canning jar.  Don\u2019t let it get too warm, try to keep air from getting in (the CO2 it produces should purge any oxygen out) and give it at least 2-3 weeks.  It needs enough time for the good bacteria to completely get rid of the bad bacteria.  \n\nGood luck",

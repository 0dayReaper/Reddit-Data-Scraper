    "postText": "So my wife and I just bought 7 acres to start our homestead on in east Texas.  We want to clear some of the smaller trees and leave the bigger ones to create a sort of open park land kinda of environment around the build site. However there is a very thick layer of leaves over everything that has choked out the grass.  Plus with so many leaves the risk of snakes hiding and not being seen till it's too late is way higher than I'd like with toddlers running around. \n\nSo what's the best way I can deal with the leaves and get some use from them?  I feel like there has to be a better way than raking them lol.  \n\nAlso I don't love the idea of just burning them, I'd like to use them for something.  I was thinking hit them with the mower to mulch them and use in the chicken coop and garden beds maybe?\n\nAlso once the leaves are up, I think it'll just be a muddy mess.  Should I do anything to promote grass to grow or just let nature handle it and be patient?",

            "comment": "You just bought the land so please be wise and observe the seasons.  Especially this summer! Where is the sun's path? Some young trees will grow up to give shade in the optimal location when its 95 degrees.  Some young trees provide the optimal habitat for birds.  And trees like to clump together for protection from the wind, if you have a windy season. Some young trees provide soil stabilization, if you have hillsides. \n\nMake gradual changes. Maybe grassland doesn't grow under big old trees?  And what species are the young trees? Some young trees are very valuable.  Consider hiring an arborist to come out for a couple hours. Maybe its just me and how I was raised because my mom is a certified arborist, but I believe as humans, we are stewards of the land and fire, so its our responsibility to be wise with land management. Glad you are mindful of this too, OP.  So please be gradual with land disturbance, like removing trees and leaves, and observe how the land reacts to disturbances. Invasive species LOVE disturbed land. For my region, if I cut down too much understory plants, poison ivy would dominate in mere weeks.  Think ahead about what plant species you want to replace the removed plants. \n\nYes, you can mulch leaves, make compost, or use for the chicken coop. They will love the bugs!  Raking is hard work, but it's good exercise and my dad would say \"builds character\" but don't overexert yourself, leaf blower is useful.  Also, controlled burns might be good in your specific region and depending on native species. I'm not familiar with East Texas ecology, so I strongly recommend asking people who are knowledgeable about your region before burning.  And consider leaving be one of the seven acres as natural forest with leaves, away from the house, for the snakes and other life to live, as its their land too.  Congrats on your new home!",

And helping with erosion during our heavy rains.  When we first bought this place, being newbies, we feared the snakes, too.  Not so much now.  See one every so often, but they tend to avoid us as much as we do them, and the benefit of their pest control far outweighs most else.",

First thing we did was mulch the thin dry layers with the mower, then started the task of literally picking up the leaves. We bought massive bags (something like 12x14) from Lowe\u2019s where you fill them up and the bag company comes with a little crane and truck and takes it away for a fee. We had the trees thinned after talking to an arborist- most of them were sick and our untrained eye didn\u2019t catch that. It was costly but we now have beautiful land that we can maintain.",

    "postText": "Has anyone seen a *safe* way to expose my septic tank to flies and capture escaping larvae for feeding chickens/pigs?  Similar to Black Soldier Fly Larvae.  There is an endless \"supply\" down there.  I was thinking of a custom lid for the tank that attracted and trapped the flies in, then an escape pipe for the larvae to crawl out and be captured.  This should work in theory, but I've never actually seen anyone talk about this free source of food.",

Partially because of the smell, the specific design of the tank and health reasons.\n\nI wish you the best of luck, because this does sound absolutely fascinating. And if it works an amazing way to get a use out of fecal matter!",

And, at least in our area, we pay the same for the HWC as we would for just the butter. We freeze the buttermilk in ice trays so I can make biscuits and buttermilk pound cake ,which has become my wife's new favorite cake! You can freeze the butter too so you dont have to use it all at once.",

However, I've tried it both ways and Imperial wins this round. \n\n2. No need for the confectioners sugar. It's great without it but you CAN add a drizzle of chocolate or strawberry syrup to a slice for a little variety. \n\n3. Add a heaping 1/4 cup of cocoa powder to the dry mix for a chocolate version. They're both great!\n\nHope you enjoy!\n\nhttps://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/buttermilk-pound-cake/",

You're one tiny misalignment away from launching those tiny gear teeth out. It really needs a housing, or to just lose the gears completely. They can catch clothing too.\n\nThe glass makes me nervous as well. There's gonna be some RPM that you can hit that shatters it just from resonant vibration.\n\nIMO-- mount the drill pointing down and bring a steel bucket up to it with a stool or something.",

This test was also done to see \u201cwhat will break first.\u201d I took some notes post test.\n\nMy title is actually a little bit misleading, I\u2019ll clarify. According the the Milwaukee website my Fuel drill used in the video has a max RPM of 2000. HOWEVER, I left an important detail out. The horizontal powered shaft sprocket and the vertical mixing shaft sprocket has roughly a 3:1 ratio. For every 1 time my drill spins. The mixer spins 3 times.\n\nThe actual speed at which I turned butter was 6000RPM. Which is fast. Faster doesn\u2019t mean better though. \u201cSlow churned\u201d butter is much more flavorful. But compared to the 90 second process time vs hours of slow churning. I\u2019m okay with sacrificing a little flavor for substantial volume.",

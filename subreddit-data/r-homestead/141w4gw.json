    "postText": "I am cleaning out my gardening shed in NJ and I heard buzzing coming from this pile of leaves and random debris. There is one bee looking bug in there but I\u2019m not confident that it\u2019s a bee because it seems like this pile is their colony. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s a wasp because it looks too round to be a hornet. They are not super aggressive because there were several plant supports in their colony and they didn\u2019t get mad when I pulled them out. If anyone knows of what they are and if they are a healthy part of NJs ecosystem that would be great! I know we have A LOT of non native bugs so if these aren\u2019t native I\u2019m probably gonna find a humane way to kill them. (Maybe with my fire extinguisher?)",

The chewed/fluffed up leaves look a lot like the doing of squirrels. You can see the paper top of screen that, likely, a rodent of some kind has chewed on it.",

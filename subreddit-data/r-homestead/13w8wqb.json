All my searches turn up contradicting information. \n\nI just moved to a property with some trees that are showing signs of different fungus issues:\nPeach tree with leaf curl and possibly bacterial canker\nLemon tree with brown rot\nApricot tree with powdery mildew\n\nAll the trees are currently fruiting. I'm in zone 9 (California).\n\nWhat are my options? I'm leaning towards copper fungicide but I've also read I shouldn't use it while the trees are fruiting or that it will only work to prevent these issues, not cure.\n\nI can't seem to find any real answers and I'm at a loss.\n\nAppreciate advice! I'm new to owning trees.",

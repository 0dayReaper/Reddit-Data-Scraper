I cured the bacon two weeks ago so I just had to put it in the smoker. So while I was butchering chickens it was doing it\u2019s thing. I\u2019ve done several thousand chickens over the years and have it down to an art. This batch of 40 took about five hours from setup to cleanup and all the birds packaged and in the fridge. The charcoal was mostly hands off as well. I just had to chunk the wood then start and maintain the fire. I did that as my break from the sauerkraut. I\u2019ve been making the kraut for over 15 years so I got my system down. Normally a couple people split and core the cabbage while I shred. I shred in to each crock individually and make my way down the row. As I fill one I then salt it before I move on. Behind me someone packs the cabbage down. Then it\u2019s just repeated until I can\u2019t feel my arms. For the kimchi I cut up everything and salted it. While it was doing its thing I made the soap. After the soap was done the kimchi was ready for the next step.",

I was always in to this kind of thing, mostly influenced by my father who never had the wherewithal to follow most things through. Huh, this sounds like the start to the blog before a recipe that\u2019s way too long. Anyways; I had a garden and chickens and rabbits in high school but when I went to college I gave all that up. After college I met my ex and I ended up moving in with her family, bit of a story with that. They had some property and I got back in to chickens and ornamental fowl (peacocks, pheasants, swans, etc.). I had a small garden, and dabbled in canning but she was indifferent at best to those endeavors. So I was mostly limited to what I could do myself on property that wasn\u2019t mine. We got a small place together, not much room for more than a garden so it continued as before. We were married for almost ten years when shit hit the fan and we divorced. I had to give up the house, garden, dogs, my pet pig and file for bankruptcy. I was in a bad place. I lived in the house for a few months while the foreclosure was going through. I was lonely and wanted temporary companionship, if you get my drift. I didn\u2019t want anything serious since I was going to be homeless soon and the fact that I got out of an almost fifteen year relationship, so I went on tinder. I had a few matches, nothing noteworthy, then I met \u201cthe one.\u201d I fell in love with her before we even met. I started calling her buttercup because of \u201cprinces bride\u201d and the whole \u201cas you wish\u201d thing. Anyway, we met, and talked about what we wanted to do with our lives and they were damn near the same. She even said the one room in the house she wanted to turn in to a room for charcuterie. We matched in May, I moved in a month later, then in September we got our first feeder pig. The following august we were married and the august after that our son was born, coincidentally enough, on our anniversary. So in the past four years we\u2019ve been slowly growing our little hobby farm and doing all the things we love. Wow, that was long winded and detailed. I hope that answers that question.",

Our whole community is quite attached to their livestock since we\u2019re mostly small scale hobbyists out here. The neighboring rancher lost 15 goats to a mountain lion a few months back and he was sobbing for days, so I can imagine how hard it was to give up your babies. I don\u2019t know what I would do if my husband wasn\u2019t supportive or at least appreciative of my canning and gardening endeavors. Now excuse me while I go Google ornamental foul for beginners.

I\u2019ve had to round up four feeder pigs who grounded out their fence and got out. It was just around freezing and had been raining for a week. Needless to say there were several colorful words used. It can seem paradoxical but the reason I raise the animals for food is because I do love them and care for their well being. If I\u2019m going to take their life so they can nourish mine the very least I can do is make sure they have a high quality of life. \nWe have a Berkshire x large black boar who\u2019s probably going on 800 lbs now. Unfortunately he\u2019s not doing his job so he has to go. I\u2019d love to keep him but it\u2019s just not practical. My GOS x tamworth sow is about the same size and she\u2019s my baby. I love going in with her, giving her belly scritches and having her flip on her side for more. \nYeah, my ex was not supportive at all. Most of the talking I did about things I wanted to pursue and accomplish were met with, \u201cthat\u2019s gay.\u201d Her words, not mine so it\u2019s in no way indicative of my personal beliefs or feelings. Anyway, it made anything I wanted to do a solo project with no support. \nLol, I\u2019m sure that would drive the dog crazy. It may be nice though if they ever got out. So I had, pheasants: red golden, yellow golden, lady Amherst, reeves, elliots and impeyan. Peafowl: Indian blue, Indian blue black shoulder, Indian blue white eye, and Spaulding.

As far as finances go most of what we do is self sustaining. The sales of produce, chicken, soap, syrup etc. pays for the supplies, our only input is our time. I\u2019m perfectly fine with that since I\u2019d be spending my time doing it anyway. It helps that we have a large network or friends and family that love our products and will purchase them from us. \nAs far as education goes I\u2019m more of a stumble through things until I find something that works. I\u2019m very introverted and have a very hard time asking questions and picking peoples brains. Good thing YouTube is around. I\u2019m always happy to show people how I do things and invite anyone to come out on a project day. Sorry for rambling, not sure if that helps but if there\u2019s anything specific I\u2019d be happy to help.",

I gather them up the night before and load them on to the trailer. The next morning I place one in the killing cone and cut off its head. While that one bleeds out I put another in the next cone and repeat that until all the cones are full. By that time the first one is ready to go so I dunk it in the scalding tank which is just a 55 gal drum cut in thirds on top of a propane burner. After it\u2019s scalded it goes in to the plucker, which is the red and blue thing behind the scalder. After that it goes in a 100 gallon stock tank with water and ice. After I get all the birds killed, scalded, plucked and iced then I\u2019ll start breaking them down as per my orders. Some people like whole birds but most just want the breast.",

Can you tell me a bit about your plucker? What are the main components and if you had to do it again, would you make or buy it?",

My partner made a spreadsheet that takes the order and converts it in to whole bird equivalents.

I have it set up so I do not sell more than about 50% of my available birds. After all orders are filled I\u2019ll keep whatever is left, which is mostly leg quarters, some breast, the tenders and the wings. This works out well for us since I love the dark meat.",

Then I\u2019ll add a couple jars of kraut to the pan and put the roast on top. Then I\u2019ll let this cook until the roast is just starting to get pull apart tender.

Depends on how much time you want to spend teaching newbies, but at least getting folks cutting/coring cabbages in an assembly line requires minimal training.  Call it \"Homesteading Bootcamp\" and put some of us hands-on learners to work!\n\nEdit: Based on your posts it looks like you might be in SW PA? I'm near Pittsburgh and I'm 100% serious about wanting to learn these skills from *somewhere* (and I'm free during the week!)  Please send me a message if you're comfortable doing so - even if you don't want to have random people come out to your farm, please let me know so I can try and support you/buy your products!",

So my partner and I only own four acres, but we have limited use of another 30 that\u2019s owned by her extended family. We use it for firewood, hunting and maple syrup. \nMy partner used to live in the city but moved to where we are now only five years ago. It was, and still is, a very difficult transition. She lost some of her friends and it\u2019s more difficult to do things with the friends she kept. It\u2019s been hard on her making new connections in the country and we had our son a little over two years ago so that\u2019s been tough, I couldn\u2019t imagine four. I wish I could offer advice but aside from stating the obvious of trying to maintain existing contacts and forming new ones I\u2019m of no use. I can say that I wish you the very best in achieving your dreams and goals. It\u2019s a lot of hard work but it\u2019s a very rewarding life. I\u2019m always happy to share my experiences and offer advice when I can so feel free to ask anything, but you probably know more than me. Best of luck to you and all your endeavors.",

You need ventilation so the smoke and volatile gasses can escape but not enough oxygen to actually burn. I place the lid on top and use the band to secure it. I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s called but it\u2019s just the normal assembly that comes with the drum. Then I place the drum on it\u2019s side and build a fire around it. I\u2019ve found that a slow, cooler fire works best. If it\u2019s too hot it heats up the wood inside too fast and causes it to split in to small pieces. I\u2019ll usually rotate the drum after about six hours so that the side contacting the drum and the one facing upwards is now exposed to the fire. After about ten hours, or when no more smoke or gasses are coming out, I roll the drum away from the rife and lift it upright. Then I place a 55 gallon drum over top of it to starve it of oxygen.",

To me it\u2019s over fermented when the cabbage gets soft but the longer the ferment goes the stronger the flavor. So you can experiment with times and temps. I know a lot of people over at the fermentation subreddit talk about ferments in days so maybe give that a peak. \nSince sauerkraut is considered a high acid food regular water bath canning is fine (the last time I checked at least).  So when it\u2019s done I heat it up outside in pots on propane burners, then bring it inside and pack it in jars then water bath can it. \nWe do add Darrow at seeds to some of the cabbage but that\u2019s about it as far as spices though. I know juniper berries are also popular. Feel free to experiment with that too. \nYou can certainly do it in glass and I think that\u2019s one of the best vessels.",

I bet it's amazing.  I've made a bunch of other kinds but there isn't generally enough osage around where I'm at to use for such things.  Oak is about as good as it gets here (which is still pretty good).  I actually did some pine a couple years ago and it was differently nice - super hot and fast which is occasionally what you want.\n\nIf you haven't tried them, the daikon greens are also super tasty.  We've pretty much lived on them overwinter quite a bit (as adjunct greens on top of rice &amp; beans or whatever).  They'll take freezing down into the mid to low 20's (F) maybe even the teens in a protected spot or if you cover them.",

I normally use whatever is around and agree oak is really great but there are very few on the property and I\u2019m not going to cut one down for charcoal. Cherry isn\u2019t that great, it seems to break apart too easily. Ash isn\u2019t bad but all the dead ones are too far gone at this point. So far the Osage holds together very well but I haven\u2019t had a chance to use it yet. That\u2019s really interesting about the pine, I never would have thought to use it. I do want to try making my own pine tar though and the process is similar.",

I think part of the problem is that it's a lot of reaction wood given how twisted the trees grow so they tend to split some on drying.  Leaving them in longer billets for a couple years first seems to minimize (but not eliminate) that.  Not sure about \"big\"  (east coast) cherry, not much of that on the west side of the rockies except as cabinet shop scraps.\n\nThere's quite a bit of scrub oak where I am, and half of it is growing half on the ground so there's a lot of fuel you can gather doing just minimal trimming and fire mitigation.  I agree I wouldn't cut down a nice one for charcoal :)\n\nThe other interesting thing to do with the charcoal pit is to add a condenser to the output and collect wood vinegar;\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6413028/\n\nhttps://www.agrowingculture.org/the-use-of-wood-vinegar-in-reducing-the-dependence-on-agro-chemicals/\n\nMy best take is that there are some anti-fungal's/anti-nematode compounds and probably a meaningful amount of gibberellic acid (and probably some related compounds) that reduce pests and enhance plant growth.  Some small amount of gibberellic acid might actually account for most of the perceived effect.",

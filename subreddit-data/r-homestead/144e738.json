Hawks, eagles, dogs and raccoons in the day as well, especially females raising babies during the day. We have a 2 ft dig barrier also. If you go to my profile you will find pictures of them. Hardware cloth covers my coop windows and screen doors. Telephone poles for the main posts, 2x4 and landscape timbers for the rest. Make sure to build a gate large enough for a wheelbarrow to get in, this will help to clean up the run believe me.",

How many animals have you dealt with this season?\n\nFor example, I've had problems with racoons damaging stuff in my orchard and my garden. Usually around this time of year, too. Once I see sings of damage, I start trapping, and I only stop trapping once the damage stops happening. Normally I end up wiping out a small group of 2 or three raccoons.\n\nThen I might go a year or even two years before it becomes a problem again. There are still raccoons on my land, of course, but what seems to happen is that the leader of a family group figures out a food source and teaches it to the others (probably a mama and her babies). But once you've wiped everyone out who's \"learned\" the behavior, the problem usually stops for a good long while.\n\nSo I'm just curious what kind of environment you're in that raccoons are going after targets during the daytime *and* possibly in large numbers? How many have you had to get rid of?",

Over time grass grew over it making it invisible. Nothing has gotten into the run in three years.\n\nEdit; we also have 100% free range Guinea foul for tick control. We loose one or two of them from time to time. Mostly to airborne predators. They act kind of like a sacrificial bird because they are easy targets.",

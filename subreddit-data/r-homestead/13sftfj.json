    "postText": "Hello, \nI work in an slow paced job , 3 jours in Morning and 2 afternoon (with 2hours lunch pause) I start 9:30 , finish 12:00 than back in 2:30 pm until 4:30 pm.\nI live in 10 minut walk from job, but in popular and Bad environnement , both for m'y mental (lot of noise, people, motocycles) and physical ( not enough Sun expossure, some mold starting..)\n\nI plan to move on for good. But so confused about where to. \n1- stay in th\u00e9 city but New home for about 90k$ in total.(safest option but exceed m'y budget) butt i will still b\u00e9 driving 15 minutes average to work, with red stops and traffic and stress.\n\n2- buy small Land un coutry side, something small lik\u00e9 2/3 Acre (2500sqm) for around 15k$ and build my own house .. where I Can smell some air. Th\u00e9 drive from job/home IS 20min, with no traffic.. Maybe if il able to have some chicken and grow some plants to suppl\u00e9ment m'y diet in future . I have gut healthy condition that doesnt allow me to think of becoming a farmer nor thee energy or willing to be one. I want to stay in m'y job.\n\nMy concern IS that since its a New exp\u00e9rience, hacking doubt if im just this Mr everybody that Dreams of living in country side and once im there i would regret it.\nTh\u00e9 others concern is s\u00e9curity. I Always lived around people in Big cities, so going Alone outsider bit scares me.. like coming back from job with someone waiting for me hiding Somewhere ..\n\nIci love to Heard your opinions and gratful for your input.",

            "comment": "Can you rent in a more rural area for a year or two and see if you like it? \n\nRenting somewhere rural would let you try out the lifestyle without the permanent commitment if you turn out to hate it. You could slowly build the collection of tools and skills necessary to be more self-sufficient than city people, while being safe from the huge expenses that sometimes happen to homeowners. \n\nWhy would someone be waiting in hiding for you? Are you in the habit of making enemies of the sort of people who would do that if they knew where you were? Does your area contain the sort of opportunists who would wait in hiding to attack random strangers in the middle of nowhere? If no and no, then you're likely safer rurally than in a city.",

The problem is that the houses standards in rural areas where are live don't stand to my standard (Bad quality) but still great advice and will consider start looking out for a house. Thanks for the advice.  \n\n\nConcerning security , the city where I live , most of young people are unemployed , and turning to theives , +++ I'm paranoid person .. I imagine stuff, this was never happened here it's just in my brain, especially that feeling of loneliness.. The smallest sound would freak the hell out of me.. And being single solo man, makes it worse LOL.   \n\n\nOpportunits in the city where I live, yes they exist but in rural areas, not sure maybe less to none.   \nNot sure if couple of cameras and a dog would guarantee some great security\n\nThere is another idea, is to share 1 hectare (2.5acre) with 3 other people that I look for , to be 2/3acre each, this way feels much safer knowing you have at least 1 neghbor (while other are abscent.",

Consider the economics of living rurally, the costs of commuting to higher-paid jobs, etc. \n\nFrankly, if you can't deal with shitty housing for a year or two in the interests of pursuing your goals, that's a sign that you may not yet have the pragmatism and tolerance for discomfort that it takes to thrive in a rural setting.",

            "comment": "Honestly, it is a big mental cliff to jump off of to move out here. No matter how much you think you are prepared it is still a huge leap of faith. And things can and WILL go sideways on you. Rules of the game. \n\nI moved to the smallest county (by population) in the entire state of TN, and this was after bouncing around like an urban pinball early in my career. Other than Madison where I went to school, I have lived in Baltimore (briefly) NYC, Chicago and Seattle. Permanent remote work and the offices closing down for good in my finance job is what prompted the move. \n\nNobody says you necessarily have to raise livestock or grow crops to live in the country. Plenty of folks just dig the elbow room, clean air and more relaxed lifestyle. Many people do gravitate this direction because they want to monetize their acreage, but if you just want to chill that is fine too. Your \"security\" concerns are a curious worry. Crime out here is nearly nonexistent. We have 1 sheriff and 2 deputies to cover hundreds of square miles, and those guys have the easiest law enforcement gig on the planet it seems to me. I often go a month or more without seeing a cop. People tend to police themselves. \n\nSince you are new to this inclination, maybe try renting out a house or AirBnB in a more remote location for awhile and see if it is something that works for you. This might be a good transition for you as you make up your mind.",

                    "comment": "Wow , thanks man for the super exaustive input. And glad you're finally setteled in small county with remote job, that's the ideal option man can have. Job, around kids and family and nature.   \n\n\nI'm also that type who only wants 4 front house exposed to sun , with fresh clean air, and no noise, relaxed. I had experience before with chickens/rabbits/backyard farm it's hella tyring job, not for me.   \n\n\nAs for crime here, we never heard of someone being attacked in country side areas , but in the city it's serious stuff, young theives attacking especially women to steal their things. ++ I'm a paranoid guy, so the entering my garden, I may just imagine all scenarios even none existent. That's why I asked if it's normal to be afraid and later you feel safe or not.  \n\n\nThe renting option is amazing though, I'll try to find a house that match my standards (since rural houses usually are in poor condition) but Still great.  \n\n\nI have also this idea of inviting people sharing a 2.5 acre land , like me and 3 more neighbors , this way feels much safer knowing you have a neighbor and not just remotly alone.  \nWhat you think ?",

You rely on those in your immediate vicinity and get pretty chummy. One neighbor and his family is already involved in commercial agriculture, the other is a fireman, teacher, and his 3 kids (who play nonstop with our kids, especially now that school is out). Nobody drives down the road to get here who does not either live here or is visiting someone who does. I know everyone's vehicles, so anything out of the ordinary would immediately draw the suspicion of my neighbors or myself. I honestly do not have a care in the world as far as security or safety except for wildlife.  \n\nOne possible option for something small scale and getting your feet wet is perhaps you and some partners forming a [CSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture). My wife manages a modest one now as we grow more food than our family could eat in a decade. This also serves the purpose of getting you really plugged in with the locals.",

If not, being that far away from work could be a problem. \n\nI agree with another poster; see if you can rent a place farther away from the city and see if that's something you like. If that's not possible, what is the resale market like where you live? If you really don't like it you could probably sell it for what you paid.",

So if you take a nail and just scratch the skin enough to release the oils, if it smells sweet, it probably is.  If it smells bitter it probably is.\n\nAvocados, pick off the little cap where the stem connected.  If it's green under that little plug, it's green throughout.  If you see brown under there, it's gonna have brown inside as well.",

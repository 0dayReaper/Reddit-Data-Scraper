Our two little goats are in my mudroom currently because I've heard so many stories of them getting eaten by bears and it's not sustainable for much longer!  \n\n\nAny product recommendations, how-to's or tips would be appreciated.  When you look online, electric netting is everywhere and I do know that isn't what I need. This is going to be their \"safe\" area and then we are going to fence more so they can access all the poison ivy (just have to clear some of the toxic plants first!)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wkx63mfl9t0b1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6ec622452d7c794210a7d6fb92e3a3ab6646ee23",

I can't speak to the efficacy of electric fence as a bear deterrent, but here's how I would use it to maximize whatever efficacy it can have.\n    \nRun a wire at the top of the fence and one about 2.5 feet off the ground.  Use single-strand electric fence, not netting (you just get more \"pop\" from single-strand, because all the energy it has available is focused in a single contact point).  I BELIEVE that most electric fence capacitors can power multiple wires simultaneously, but you'll need to check the individual manufacturer's literature (aka, read the manual).\n    \nYou'll affix the wires directly to those wooden posts using ceramic or plastic insulators.  So it's just: staple (or nail) the insulators to the posts using fencing staples, then connect the electric wire to the insulators, and you're done.  If you're using old school, center-nailed ceramic circular insulators, you can either rest the wire on top OR wrap the wire around the insulator with wire pliers.  IF you decide to wrap, keep it tight.\n    \nYou do that, you'll have done everything you can do.\n    \nOne more thing, because my fencing OCD can't resist: you need to rebuild the fence termination to the right of your gate.  Even with that diagonal brace, you can already see the terminal post is leaning to the right.  That'll just keep happening.  [This is a good short-form on how to build a proper fence termination.](https://www.agproud.com/articles/48948-4-steps-to-construct-a-long-lasting-h-brace)  On the ranch, we build these out of railroad ties, but we're also supporting wire tension from thousands of feet of wire.  In your application, literally just using two closely-spaced posts like what you're using will be enough, provided you add the cross bar and the diagonal tensioning wire.  Well done fencing is a thing of beauty, and joy for about 20 years, depending on soil moisture conditions.",

I had a bear decimate my apiary last year and had to build a fence.  3 strands on the outside of your fence should do, 6/15/28 inches or similar.  You need at least .7 joules to get a bear's attention with their thick fur.  \n\n\nI have a zaremba 15mi DC charger on a battery.  I bought a solar panel off 'zon and an optical sensor so it comes on after dark but isn't on during the day.  It keeps the battery charged and lessens the chance of me or family getting shocked.  \n\n\nGood luck.  I hate bears!",

But I have loader envy! We've got lots of brush that needs moving from point a to point b so a grapple or loader is definitely on the wish list. Enjoy! We love ours - hubby keeps saying, \"man this was money well spent\".",

I don't even have a ride on lawn mower and push mow probably \\~1 acre right now.  I have a lot of downed trees and brush, and need to clear an area for a shop in the next couple of years.  Something like this would make quick work of it, but I've never used equipment like this before and no clue where to even start learning.",

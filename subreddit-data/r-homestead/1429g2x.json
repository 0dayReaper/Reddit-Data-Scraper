    "postText": "Hi everyone.\n\nI'm new to this subreddit, and wanted to quickly introduce myself. I live in the foothills of the Cardamom Mountains (on the Thai side) and practice subsistence farming together with my wife. We're off-grid for five years now (completely without electricity for the first two, but now we have a small-scale PV system) - before that, I lived on a small permaculture farm in the South of Thailand for five years, where I learned the basics of simple living, self-sufficiency and subsistence farming (and met my wife). \n\nI write about our life (occasionally) and many other things on my blog, to advertise the simple life and a more natural lifestyle in general. Here is the first part of a series I recently began, which will give you an overview of everyday life on our small homestead in the tropical rainforest of Southeast Asia (and its upsides and downsides). Maybe this essay is interesting or entertaining for some people here, since it seems most members inhabit the temperate climate zone:\n\n[https://animistsramblings.substack.com/p/seasonal-rhapsody-part-i-water](https://animistsramblings.substack.com/p/seasonal-rhapsody-part-i-water) \n\nBest greetings from the jungle!",

We have plans for a jungle life so your writing was insightful. \nAs someone who has only garden in cold and hot weather, we are reliant on a green house, would this be helpful to have in a jungle environment? \nWould bringing the seeds inside your house and placing them in a glass jar help with seed saving?",

What are your plans, where do you want to go?\n\nYeah, greenhouses would definitely help, but due to our limited budget we won't make that investment. Furthermore, in the tropical sun the plastic degrades quite fast, so every few years you have a heap of plastic trash if you don't buy the most expensive stuff. Personally, we've just decided that it's not worth the trouble. We don't *need* tomatoes in rainy season, for instance, and things that you can only grow in a greenhouse in the tropics (like lettuce) are simply not on our menu. We eat wild leafy greens, which are much more nutritious as well (lettuce contains mostly water and virtually no phytonutrients). \n\nWe do keep our seeds in little plastic ziplock bags, those bags in larger ziplock bags, and the larger bags in a tightly sealed plastic box. We have some seeds in glass jars, but the problem is always the same: each time you open it, humidity comes inside. This is why we have to do the technique I described in the essay where we put the jars out in the sun every now and then. Still, you can't keep the humidity out 100%, and sometimes seeds are not completely dry when we store them (can be tricky in rainy season) so mold develops.",

There are cacao tree, papaya and banana trees that are producing. All the the other trees are not producing as much (mango, avocado, coconut). \n\nThe hostal still has to pay to go to the nearest market to to get produce and bring it in 30 minutes hike into the jungle. It has to be brought in on backs because there is no road for even a bike. \n\nI want to plant and grow the basics like peppers, tomatoes, onions, garlic, herb garden, lettuce garden and spinach. I have been successful starting food gardens in the states but I am seeing the challenges in a jungle environment. \nYou are the first real blog I\u2019ve found that has real life account of the challenges. \n\nI know  I have to adapt to different types of greens that are similar to what we are used to in the west.",

                    "comment": "We're kind of doing our own thing here - we apply basic permaculture principles, but do it in a much more radical way (in the literal sense of the word). Permaculture is based on indigenous horticultural techniques, so we want to go to the root of that with our method of gardening. We're working on a concept we've termed Primitive Permaculture, if you want to read more about it, [here's a link to our website](https://feunfoo.org/our-goals/permaculture/primitive-permaculture/).\n\nWe live in a pretty \"wild\" setting, so that's naturally what comes to mind for us. Furthermore, living on a relatively steep mountainside, there's many permacultural concepts and methods we simply can't apply here. The conditions and soil here are super weird, too. It took us *three f-cking years* to grow a decent lead tree (\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e16\u0e34\u0e19), we still can't grow moringa (\u0e21\u0e30\u0e23\u0e38\u0e21), and even the ubiquitous Jamaican cherry (\u0e15\u0e30\u0e02\u0e1a\u0e1d\u0e23\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07) won't grow. The soil is really acidic, and lost most of its fertility when people were farming rice here 50 years ago (all the topsoil washed down in the first year of tilling the soil). Moreover, at the height of rainy season we have *tons* of rain and the soil will be waterlogged for a few weeks each year, despite being 300m above sea level. I write a bit about the latter in the essay above.",

Though we had meat chickens vs turkeys, my families meat chickens came from a breeder that had issues with leg dysplasia once the chickens got around harvesting size. They could only walk short distances and then would lay down and their legs would splay. My parents decided to no longer use that supplier especially after a lot of the chicks suffered from heart failure as well as the leg dysplasia. It is so inhumane to genetically modify chickens to that point and my parents would not support it. It may be worth it to ask more questions next time you get some chicks about issues with leg dysplasia.",

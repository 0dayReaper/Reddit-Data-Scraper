            "comment": "HDPE is my choice.. buy a good brand of tubing though. Not sure what size of farm you are looking to set tubing up for. I have a 18 acre hobby farm and I buy irrigation stuff and tubing from DripWorks. Tubing can be of several types.. I try to keep things simple and flexible for future use so just buy standard 3-4 mainline tubing. \n\n[https://www.dripworks.com/3-4-polyethylene-mainline-tubing-0-830-id-x-0-940-od](https://www.dripworks.com/3-4-polyethylene-mainline-tubing-0-830-id-x-0-940-od)\n\nDepending on my farm section and type of crop I connect it will driptape and a 1/4 inch soaker line",

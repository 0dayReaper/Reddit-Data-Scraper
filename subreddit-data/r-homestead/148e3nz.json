My understanding is they're a lot easier to manage but about twice the cost of traditional cattle. \n\nHow much pasture so you have and are you planning to do pasture rotation? Any thoughts on potential predator pressure like coyotes? \n\nWe looked into mini cows briefly but then decided goats were more practical. Age and Health issues meant we ended up selling before we got any, but I still like to fantasize about the lifestyle.",

We have 5 acres about 3 pastured split in half. We only plan on having 2 heifers at a time and rotating between the two pastures. We will artificially inseminate them to avoid having a bull. Bulls are a ton of work and most of the time your just feeding them while they sit. Cost of a tube of semen from a dexter bull in my area is anywhere from 15-40$ a straw. Much more cost efficient. We also raise boer goats and they all roam together. It can be done! But planning if you have a smaller acreage is a must!!",

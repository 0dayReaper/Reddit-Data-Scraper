But the views are better.\n\nLand is cheaper and more abundant in TN, AR, and NC It seems. But its the south...\n\nAlso, TN doesnt have many regulations on how you control your own land, which is nice.\n\nIt seems designed this way to keep poor people out.\n\nIve been trying to find land, but every parcel is usually tied up in some HOA, and they have very strict rules.  My origional plan was to park an RV, and live out of that while I build...but most places wont let you.\n\nedit. Arkansas",

If I work from 9am-2pm I'll be at 12.8 come dark. With the shite angles at the 47th parallel I have to run overs and trim the excess to ensure max charge time. I alleviate some of this by running 4/0 pure copper on the main runs.\n\nPanels were the cheap part.\n\nThat being said, climate control is the most energy intensive thing we do. I only use a fan if I'm overworked and over heated and about to stroke out and we have a wood stove for heat and cooking. All other appliances that can be propane, are propane.",

We have a full size home and we run a 5 burner induction cooktop, electric oven, dishwasher, full size clothes washer and heat pump dryer. You could definitely get by with less without using electricity for cooking, which is the biggest energy suck for us since I cook for my family three meals a day. \n\nWe also don\u2019t have our heating system (radiant in the floors) or hot water on solar right now, they are propane. We found that our solar capacity is not enough to run those. One day we hope to add a wood burning boiler outside to heat water for our radiant system.",

The original structure was the hardest to save for as we were living in a rental at the time. Once we moved into the property, it was easier to save the monthly rent to then build 3 years later.\n\nI wish we had built a small shed before building to store all the tools.",

They sold the land and moved to an assisted living facility and it was so sad. They were so remote they couldn't get anyone to come help take care of stuff for them, so they weren't able to spend all their remaining days at their beloved home. They built everything and had to leave it behind for a 1 bedroom studio. Truly heartbreaking.",

If they do, they can have the original house and we'll move to a smaller cabin. \nIf not, well, we'll live in it as long as we can, and just adapt. And sell in the end if it comes to that. \nWe plan for the best, and will adapt on the way. \n\nWe have friends in their 80s who are still on their homestead, but their kids didn't continue.

Youre an adult, do whatcha want.\n\nThe cistern. I got 2 free above ground pools off craigslist. Put one up. Filled it with rain water over a winter (solar powered pump to strain, pumped through 5 gallons sand and 5 gallons activated charcoal). The other pool i splayed out and cut the vinyl into a cover for the main one, just tent staked opposing directions every 4 feet. Took about 3-4 months for me to gather enough cinder blocks off Craigslist/marketplace but I eventually met my mis so I prepared the ground and right before planting them I spread the inside with bentonite (if you can't find it dirt cheap, Walmarts cheap kitty litter is 99.9% bentonite, just strain it and take out any color 'crystals' *before* you rehydrate it back into clay) and stacked my wall. I bought some concrete and rebar and filled it in in an (I can't say that without it being stattico; filled it in in an...language is weird, lol) afternoon. Made a roof with chicken wire and permiable cement (cement and aggregate, but no fines/no sand, water falls right thru it) and boom. Right before finishing the roof I cut the pool and pulled the vinyl out. With a block and tackle in line on a comealong. I'm strong but 18000 gallons of water is 144,000 pounds. Yeesh. Patience and perseverance and I have a ridiculously large cistern that cost less than $500. I have a UVC light midpipe after the outpump in the pumphouse. Waters pure, no residual taste of anything. Suck it brita\n\nI've been saving all our jars too, for a smaller greenhouse dedicated to my wife's... Um.. greens. Stack the jars bottom out between the framing and plaster in place. Jars will trap all the heat in, AND it'll look freaking cool as hell... And hopefully obfuscate just enough to not invite suspicion from a distance. Nothing to see here. Carry on.",

I've got 2.4 acres and much cleaner living space though now, definitely plan on solar and garden space though. \n\nI plan to spend my first couple years mainly planting for pollinators. The area seems to have a great ecology of mushrooms and frogs, skinks and those types of things, but I know there are also some trash landfills in a few spots out back. \n\n\nLooks great!

We lived it very basic for the first 2 years, no electricity, etc.\nWe did all the work ourselves (except for the roof on the first two buildings.)\nThe land was the most expensive part, obviously, and we made a loan for it. The rest was working several jobs for three years to save for that first building. Once we moved in, it was easier to save as we didn't have to pay rent, and all went towards saving to build extra space 3 years later. \nWe put in a regular toilet just this year. We still don't have a modern bathroom. It's a work in progress type of house. \n\nAnyway, all to say, depending on your budget, and your family situation, it's not impossible. Not possible for everyone, but not impossible either. We had a kid when we moved, so couldn't live in a tent for a year for example. But I know some adults who REALLY roughed it, a lot of my friends did in the 70s.",

We had one solar panel at the time, and you are right, that was an issue. They are now secured, it might not look like it from this picture, but they are. And even with high wind for this area, it has never been an issue since then. \n\nThis region will be impacted by floods more likely in the coming decades, and where we built in our town will not be directly impacted. \n\nThanks for the question!",

Look for work and keep looking after you find some.\n\nI was in debt and out of work and found work as a carpenter, landscaper, tree crew leader, learned roofing on a crew, learned how to install and fix leaky skylights, went solo and did smaller jobs (garages etc), fixed skylights, porches, etc.\n\nI bought good tools along the way and when we bought our own property I had everything I needed to build structures for livestock that we needed, plus the skill and grit to tackle a big plumbing job on the main house, saving thousands on that job alone.\n\nI've also gotten a reputation for working - showing up on time, staying focused, and banging it out all day long.  It's helped me advance in my career which is thankfully far from knucklescraping (work from home on a computer now) and I can be with my family.\n\nI still know the value of things and don't buy things I don't need, watch interest rates, and build/make things when I need them if I can, but I've gotten to the point where I don't have to do a two week budget analysis to buy a bag of nuts.\n\nKeep to your plan for your dream. Never stop working towards it.  Every step along the way can give you firmer footing once you get there.",

No, that's not how most people do it. lol\n\nAs mentioned already, something like this is achieved very slowly over a long period of time, usually decades. You have to start somewhere. You can't expect to somehow save 5 million dollars in two days if you're working at Starbucks twice a year making $150. Make realistic goals for yourself  that you can easily achieve in your current situation and go from there.",

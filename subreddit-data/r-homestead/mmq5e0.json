Many vehicles have CVT transmissions, even crossovers and \u201cSUV\u2019s\u201d, that limit towing capacity to 500lbs or so.  With that considered, I\u2019d recommend a 5\u2019 x 10\u2019 trailer with a ramp, over a 4\u2019 x 6\u2019.  It just easily fits so much more-full sheet of ply wood/fence posts/riding mower can be driven right up.",

That plus another short piece of wood covered any openings ensuring that the cement blocks weren't going anywhere.  Theoretically the boards could slide out backwards but with their size, weight, and added pressure from the tailboard I was comfortable make the 5 mile drive home on paved roads.  A sudden stop would push them into the trailer, sudden acceleration just isn't happening with that load, nothing to really be caught by a wind load.  In the past when carrying less I'll use the tie downs in the bed to run a ratchet strap over the load.",

You also need to have the room to store a trailer when not in use. Plus half ton pickups these days will all tow and haul significantly more than a car or minivan will. You may not need that capacity- but there is still a significant difference.",

At least in my area you can. I would prefer a Toyota but I don't have 20k for a 200k+ mile truck, very over priced. The Silverado's seem to do fine and if it has a v8, has a pretty decent tow rating.",

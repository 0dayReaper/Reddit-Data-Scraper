Was never used as an outhouse. Any tips, comments, ideas etc? I figured id just run a galvanized pipe into the bottom and put some racks inside",

We got a free mouser with it too. It was never used as an outhouse. It's not sitting on a hole. It's had a rake, some trowels and a hundred walnuts in it or 25 years now. \n\nThe plan I think is to put the firebox in the seat, with a hole dug to the outside to shovel coals into. Thermometers wedged into the sides and hooks and racks hung up",

Hot smokers are much smaller and are typically insulated to a degree to help even out the heat. You cold smoke bacon and stuff that will later be properly cooked, hot smoke stuff that is to be eaten then (or stored....) You should look into the differences and figure out which direction you want to go with it.",

Top racks we would cold smoke things like nuts and cheese then the bottom rack closer to the fire we would smoke jerky or whatever other meat we wanted. If you do a box on the side and run a pipe you won't get a lot of heat depending on how you design it. If you're just looking to cold smoke a lot at once that would be perfect. If not I would just guy it and put some racks in there. You will want a pan you can fill with water above the heat though to one catch grease and two to keep some moisture in the air. If you want more control you can get a propane burner with a cast iron pan or some other high heat metal plate and just put wood chips on it but still have a pan of water on the rack directly above it. That design is really no different than most camp chef smokers. I'm a retired chef and I cure meats also have smoked about everything at one time including but not limited to candy bars, my own cured hams, back bacon, bacon , jerky, heavy cream, salt , pepper I could go on and on lol",

Even though it\u2019s larger than your oven, it\u2019s not that big for smoking meats. I dream of one day building one myself.  My idea was to build a teepee with a heavy tarp or hide, chimney at the top where the poles meet, protect it from elements somehow, then have a fire pit on the outside with a pipe to run the hot smoke into. This way your not opening up to stoke the fire. Also need some good wood to add flavor and not just any old smoke.  If it\u2019s too hot, you just roast the meat, it should be a slow low process with hot smoke to cure the outside. \nMaybe you could turn the sitting part into a drawer that you turn into a fire box but pulled out, so the smoke is drawn inside.  Sounds like an adventure, I wish you luck!",

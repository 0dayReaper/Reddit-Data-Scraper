    "postText": "So I posted a few days ago inquiring about 3 hens not laying in their boxes to which I got some good replies. Keeping them locked up, ceramic eggs, etc. I kept them in for 3 days and when I went to check them this morning I only had two eggs and one looked like this. I searched and it said it could be from staying in the Hen for too long so I checked my hens and one of them was stopped up. Egg shell on tail feathers, fecal matter, etc, so I cleaned her off the best I could. Is this a Hen issue? A care and husbandry issue? Am I just experiencing the joys of having livestock for the first time? HELP!!! Im getting very few eggs to eat and truly I'm losing my mind.",

It sounds like one of your chickens might have a problem.   If the others are fine then cull the sick one and move on.   It's insane to spend $300 to save a $10 chicken.",

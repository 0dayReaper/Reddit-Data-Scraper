    "postText": "I am not sure if this is the correct page for this but I will ask anyways. I currently have a decent sized balcony garden that I want to keep watered while on vacation. After researching online I found you can place one end of a string in a bucket of water and one end in the dirt by the plant roots and the plant will draw water as needed. This is the best solution because my balcony has no hose outlets. I will also wrap the exposed line in plastic wrap to prevent evaporation on hot days. I experiment a bit and it works well. I notice that some plants draw out a lot of water, sometimes a jar full is empty by the end of a day. I am considering using buckets but I worry about that attracting bugs and also evaporating over time. I want to find something that will keep out bugs, not evaporate, and also have easy access to refill. Does anyone have any ideas?",

            "comment": "Crazy, I'm in exactly the same situation about to go on a 2.5 week vacation. My plan is to fill a large Home Depot bucket and then cover it with foil, letting the strings come out around the edge. Any solid covering should sufficiently reduce evaporation, and foil specifically is light (won't pinch of the water flow to the strings), opaque (will keep the inside of the bucket dark to limit the growth of algae), and can be molded around the bucket and strings to largely keep out insects. As for refillability, this is a one-off situation for me, so that's not really an issue",

You could try plastic wrap like you said, but that seems tedious.\n\nAnother option would be to use a bunch of mason jars instead (cheap), and place them near the plants, thus minimizing the overall length of string",

I built one (I've also seen them at home depot) and almost never had to worry about watering while I was gardening in my apartment.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI bought a Homestead in Lithuania and am currently stuck in China. \n\nCan finally visit in July. \n\nIt has been dormant but family band friends were able to visit already. \n\nIt has an existing well but no connection to the house. Didnt have a septic tank but we managed to get one installed already. \n\nI think it would be good to buy a suitable pump here and bring it over as form my research I would save some money buying it here. \n\nProblem is is don't have any details on the well. Don't know how deep it is. All I have are pictures. \n\nI was hoping somebody could help with a guess ok what kind of pump would be most suitable. \n\nFrom my research I would say it all comes downs to depth.\n\nHere is a picture and a video. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Zv5MHbq.jpg\n\nhttps://streamable.com/cgsiwk\n\nIt's not a lot to judge accurately and I would need a proper evaluation to make the right call - hoping it's enough for an educated guess and if I get lucky i can find a pump here that i can use for the well later on...",

That's what I will do when I arrive!\n\nJudging from speaking to family who were there and the pictures I would guess it's not deeper then 8m. \n\nSo I think a submersible pressure pump would be more suitable then a deep well pump \ud83e\uddd0",

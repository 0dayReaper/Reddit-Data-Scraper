You might be able to graft the top or sections of it onto heathy root stock, or likewise use the root stock to graft onto.  The center isn't going to carry nutrients anymore; you might be able to frankengraft the tops to the bottoms, but I highly doubt it.\n\nIn essence, I don't think you can save the trees as they were, but you might get cherries out of them yet, if you have skill.",

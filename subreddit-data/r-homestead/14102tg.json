    "postText": "We have 2+ acres that I'd love to put some critters on to help maintain the vegetation but am very indecisive on what would work best. I've considered and researched many herbivores including mini horses and mini donkeys, beef steer, Boer goats, sheep, llamas, etc. \n\nHow did you decide what to raise? \n\nFactors in deciding: \n- must tolerate rain. We live in NW Washington\n- areas of standing water during the wet season. \n- we commonly have predators like bear, coyotes, cougar, and bobcats\n- do not want a LGD. Our spoiled terrier is king of the castle and gets along great with our chickens. \n- don't want the hassle of milking\n- currently fully fenced with 3 strand barbwire. Can add hotwire if needed. \n- half of available land has cottonwood scattered throughout which creates nice shade \n- vegetation consists of primarily reed canary grass, creeping buttercup, fern, and Himalayan blackberry. \n- no large/sophisticated outbuilding. Could build a simple shelter. \n- harvesting for meat is not a requirement but definitely a bonus\n- want to ensure appropriate social needs are met (no solitary herd animals)\n- could aquire needed supplies and learn to sheer \n- near a very busy road: would hate to have an escapee end up in traffic\n- prepared to invest in proper husbandry including veterinary care\n\nI'm often drawn to unique or heritage breeds. \n\nThoughts?",

            "comment": "Buy a lawnmower it's cheaper and the right thing to do.  There are no cheap shelters in the northwest!  All animals need a 100% dry and draft free shelter.   No exceptions.  If you think animals are cheap and easy then you need to redo the math.   They will need hay and grain in the fall, winter and spring.   You or a vet will need to do parasite tests and hoof maintenance.    Then there's grooming tools, minerals, shots, troughs, feeders etc.   Should an animal get sick or get hoof rot then it's thousands of dollars to fix them.   Most animals will use the shelter when needed if it's adequate but that means you cleaning it out so it stays dry and clean.   You also need to be able to lock your animals up at night.   One lgd will not be enough.   And they must be maintained and fed as well.   A cougar or bear does not give a shit about one dog.   Our neighbor has lost 3 in the last 2 years.   Good luck.",

Or easy? \n\nI am well aware of what livestock need and have the budget for them, as clearly stated. \n\nI was hoping for personal opinions and experiences on what livestock people have enjoyed raising in the PNW since each type has their own unique pros and cons. \n\nWhy do you assume ignorance on my part?",

Almost all of them want to know the best way to nail the pallets together and have done zero research prior to getting animals. My personal opinion is Nigerian Dwarf goats.   They do great at keeping the blackberries and poison oak down.    They also do great at general lawn mowing.   The down side is that they hate the rain and generally stay inside until it stops.   They are awesome summer animals.   The years when we don't see the sun for 6 months, not so much.",

            "comment": "I would stay away from mini donkeys and mini horses as they are pretty high maintenance with their diets and cannot be used to graze areas down. Goats may be your best bet, but if you aren't looking to get a lgd then you need a tough herd. Boer goats are pretty hardy. Marc Warnke lives over in Idaho and raises some pretty tough packing goats. You may need to upgrade your fencing though, as they need pretty reinforced barriers to stay where they should.",

I always wanted to get a professionally made home for the lil guys, but bucket/terrarium systems work well if you\u2019re on a budget. I would order at least 5,000 since less than that can be difficult to start off, in my experiences. The system also doesn\u2019t smell foul, which I was surprised by. In CA I started a compost toilet with them and I was shocked with how voracious eaters they were.",

I was living off grid in the redwoods of CA renting a cabin from a kooked out old guy whom also lived on the property. There were three separate occupied structures in various states of decay, and ours was the best put together structure. We had a water pump pulling water from a nearby creek, but we were on some mad max style limited water consumption lifestyle even though everyone around us was trying to make a million $$$ growing CA cash crops \ud83d\ude44. The landlord had spent $2,000ish a few years prior on a fancy compost toilet system that was about the size of a large cooler designed in such a way where you would sit on the toilet, do your business, it would fall through a hole in the floor through a wide tube into this cooler sized holding tank thing that was underneath the cabin and I had to go under there about once a week(give or take a few days if we had guests) to turn a crank to rotate the slop around. One of the days that I had to churn the slop I saw two rats hop out of the holding tank thing and I was so disgusted of the idea of rodents getting my fecal emissions on them and trotting around the cabin that I ordered a bunch of BSFL which I had already had table scraps compost bins of in the past. I found a used metal 55 gallon drum on FB marketplace for cheap, kersmashed a few small holes in the bottom so excess moisture would have a means to drain off (but to small for rodents), and we put a five gallon bucket of wood shavings in the bathroom so that when you were done doing your business you would throw a handful or two of wood shavings down the hole. It was pretty simple, cheap and effective. The only issue I ever had with it was if to many girls were visiting they would drench the colony whereas all the guy visitors I would just tell to go find a tree. If you\u2019re in a colder climate you\u2019ll need to partially insulate the colony, either by sinking it into the ground, or wrapping something around it, or whatever you need to do to keep it warm enough.",

                    "comment": "You can actually do this in a greenhouse year round. You just need a temperature at least close to 75 degrees. Production will decrease as temperature decreases up until they go dormant. You also don't have to worry about the cold too much either. It may hurt the adults and maybe the pre-pupa or larva, but the larva tend to just go dormant and go right back to developing once it warms up. The pupa stage and the adults do not eat. They are just stores of energy for mating and producing more eggs. So even in an enclosed greenhouse once they mature they will simply mate and lay more eggs in the same places they came from.\n\nFor this reason, in a lot of places, you don't even need a starter colony. The right smells will attract adult wild black soldier flies. In the wild food sources tend to come and go. So adults have wings to spread out and find new food sources to lay eggs near. They don't lay eggs in the food source, only near it. But once you are providing a continuous food source you will always have adults developing and laying eggs near the same food source they were raised on.\n\nOnce the pupa have passed the larva stage that don't require food they migrate away from the food source and bury in the ground until they develop into adults. This is how they are collecting the larva, by collecting the ones that are migrating away from the food source in search of dirt to bury in and await adulthood. Essentially taking advantage of their normal lifecycle behavior changes.\n\nSo if you want to insure a strong spring colony you can keep a fair number of the larva safe overwinter by allowing some of them access to loose soil they can safely bury in and go dormant. Feeding the rest to the chickens. Once they warm up enough they'll finish developing and start laying eggs again, restarting the process. You can extend the year with a good greenhouse; how much depends on how much effort you want to put in keeping the greenhouse warm enough.",

What the above poster is saying is, they probably got a 50 gallon drum, drilled holes all around it at various heights, and consistently fill it with their food scraps, probably lawn scraps/grass clippings.  Since is it s larger barrel, they more than likely have it resting on the ground in the pen with their ducks. The ducks are unable to get inside of the barrel and the fly larvae crawl out of the holes on the side.  The holes are big enough for them to crawl out, but small enough for the scraps to stay inside and to leach water so it doesn't hold water as well. The OG for this comment thread used a smaller bucket and hung it above their chicken pen. The food scraps are eaten very quickly by the larvae so you don't have to really worry about bad smells or the containers overflowing.",

If your intention is to them to feed poultry I would recommend establishing two colonies on the same property, one that self harvests inside the chicken pen and one where the larvae are free to pupate into flies, lay eggs and keep producing more larvae. With the two established colonies your no longer dependent on having to rebuy more when your poultry gobbles up all your larvae.",

Collect road kill, throw it into the crate and the maggots drop out to the ground or in this case into the water to feed the fish. It works here because we don\u2019t have any native mammals or snakes etc not sure you could do this in all countries!",

(I am a fruit fly geneticist by training, so I know way too much about flies).  The little nooks and crannies would undoubtedly fill up with eggs cases, and that is how you get so many crawling larvae.  In a compost pile, they might cover the surface, but every time you turn the compost, you bury the eggs/larvae, and the pupae get further and further from the top ---- a spot newly eclosed adults can climb out of.  So I would expect the compost pile would have a fly problem, but it wouldn't generate NEAR as much mature fly biomass as this fly farm.....",

The way pupation works:\nFlies are holometabolous insects, meaning they go through a complete metamorphosis.  Hemimetabolous insects are things like grasshoppers, where they hatch as little miniatures of their adult forms and go through molts, to accommodate size increases.  Flies go thru a larval feeding stage.  They have almost no calories in their eggs, so the reproductive strategy mom employs is to make a huge number of eggs, with little metabolic input;  then hope the larvae find enough to eat to survive, to make a few adults.  \n\nThe larvae have two types of cells.  The cells required to be a larvae.  fat body, gut tube, exoskeleton, glands, CNS, etc., but then they also have imaginal disks.  Imaginal disks are these little sets of cells that will eventually develop into the adult structures:  legs, eyes, wings, antennae, genitalia.  When the larvae forms a pupal case, they stop eating, because they are encased and have no access to food.  All of the tissues of the larval body liquify and the nutrients are reused to form the new adult.  The adult DEFINITELY has a gut tube and eats;  in fact there are these really fun genetic mutants (in the enzymes required for metabolic pathways)  that were identified  using colored food that you can actually see passing through the gut tube.  \n\nI they eat nectar, they have interest in fruit.",

Are there sources of amino acids that are available to insects that aren't available to chicken? Sure plants like alfalfa or lentils can make protein more or less literally out of thin air with the bacteria at their roots (if I understood correctly)\n\nSo I still don't understand: is there something in coffee that only insects can turn into protein? What are worms eating that chickens can't eat for protein? Why not let you chickens dig through compost themselves?\n\nSorry if it sounds like I'm badmouthing the concept.

But more important is which amino acids are essential for which animal and the rate at which they can utilize them. And yes, there are sources chicken can\u2019t eat but larvae can. Like coffee grounds as they\u2019re toxic to them.\n\nChicken need 12 essential amino acids (humans need 9) and while they can get them through other sources like wheat germs, different veggies or lactose free milk products etc. larvae are the most densely packed source possible. They are basically an energy bomb.\n\n1000g of dry black soldier fly matter contain a full 350g of crude protein:  https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Nutritive-value-and-amino-acid-profile-of-Black-soldier-fly-full-fat-larvae-meal-BSFL_tbl1_345905132\n\nBut the main reason is that larvae grow unbelievably fast and can use the source nutrients much quicker than chickens could. The turnover is just faster and you don\u2019t have to keep an eye on a balanced diet as much because the larvae contain all amino acids. The life cycle of insects is just faster and different than ours (or than chickens), so they pack a lot of energy into the larval stage.\n\nI don\u2019t want to push the topic onto you, I don\u2019t even have chicken, the school my kids go to have them but I\u2018m a research geek and just know too many too boring and sometimes unuseful things lol",

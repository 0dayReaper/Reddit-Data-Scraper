    "postText": "For a summer I had difficulty finding accomidation, so i was generously offered a mobile home from family friends. I'm happy to tough it out for the summer and thankful for there help. It has no electricity or running water, I have a gas two ring hob, but no oven.\nNo fridge is what I'm most concerned about. I would love some tips tricks and recpies. I concider myself fairly handy and do have access to a shower and washing machine. But any advice for storing food would be great. I'm not vegetarian, but don't eat much meat and with no fridge I'm thinking of foregoing meat and dairy.\nAlso at the moment can't afford a generator.",

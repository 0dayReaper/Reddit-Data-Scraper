Typically you keep them at the bottom. That is where the queen is doing all her laying. The smaller boxes are called mediums, or honey supers. You put a Queen excluder screen between the deep and the super to keep the queen from getting into the honey super to lay eggs. \n\n\nSince honey is so heavy, the higher the hive stack gets, the harder it starts getting to lift them apart. Also, again since it\u2019s so heavy, it\u2019s better to keep honey only in the smaller boxes.\n\n\nTo lower the overall stack size, and grow your apiary, you can split up those two deep boxes into different stacks. Then you put two new empty deeps on top of those deeps so they have room to grow. \n\n\nThen you would take the honey out of those smaller boxes and split them between two stacks you just made.",

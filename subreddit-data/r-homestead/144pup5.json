    "postText": "Looking for some guidance from folks with experience in California around needs for livestock guardians. I recently moved to a 20 acre property in rural West Marin. It's mostly wooded hillside with a couple of acres of grassy paddocks that previously housed horses.\n\nI'm planning on making a chicken coop and large run like I had in the city which was very predator proof, so I'm not concerned there. I can lock the chickens up at night to keep them safe.\n\nI want to get a miniature milk cow and possibly a few goats, which is where I'm looking for advice. I know there are bobcats and coyotes which could take the goats but probably not the cow. I don't know if there are cougars in my immediate area, but there probably are and those could be a threat to the cow.\n\nI know a LGD could be an answer, but I'm wondering if a proven guardian donkey could also work. It's appealing mostly because I wouldn't worry as much as I would about the LGD escaping and barking and needing different food than the lovestock. My neighbor already has a donkey, so the braying is something I already have to deal with.\n\nOr am I inventing a problem to solve? I just don't want to invest in livestock only to put them in a dangerous position, but I also don't want to over-invest in solving a problem that might have a simpler solution.",

            "comment": "There are definitely mountain lions in West Marin. But even with that, your question is probably too locally specific for the Internet to help you. I feel like I don't see guard animals around all the cows grazing in the area, but a herd of cows is probably different to a predator than a single one. On the other hand I know people who have had coyotes try to lure away their small off-leash dogs while hiking in the area, so they're definitely aggressive (but these were also like 15lb dogs - much smaller than a goat).\n\nDo you know anyone in the area you can ask? Maybe your neighbor with the donkey? (Why do they have a donkey? Might be informative!).",

            "comment": "Up a few hours north of you, but have also lived in Marin.  We have lots of mountain lions here.  Likely much more than in Marin, based on the number of sightings I hear about in the small community and the ones I've recently seen.  A calf would be taken by a mountain lion without its mama.  Depending on how miniature the dairy cow, I could see that happening too.  More than a few cows and they are probably fine at protecting themselves.  We have a LGD for our goats.  Great Pyrenees does well.  Even so, we have lost some goats to mountain lions but it is  rare.  I hear that donkeys do well as guardians.",

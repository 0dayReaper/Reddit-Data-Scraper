Supposing that you manage to rinse it out thoroughly, you're unlikely to give anyone a lethal dose.\n\nThat said, non-lethal doses result in significant kidney injury.\n\nSo it's up to you if you'd drink anything out of it; I'd certainly want to fill it and empty it a significant number of times before I did.  Ethylene glycol mixes readily with water so it will wash out but I'd want to make really sure if it was me.  It'd be fine for use as a water butt for watering your garden - if you can be reasonably certain that no children or animals are going to drink from it.\n\nOne last, critical point that I don't think anyone else has covered: **Do you KNOW that it hasn't been used to store something else in the meantime?**  Someone else could easily have looked at this and thought, \"This isn't food-grade, so no-one will ever keep water in it.  I'll be okay keeping &lt;insert poison of choice&gt; in it.\"",

Your liver will process the ethanol instead of the ethylene glycol and you will remove the toxin by urination. \n\nHere's a bit more scientific explanation.  Ethanol acts by competing with ethylene glycol for\u00a0alcohol dehydronase\u00a0(ADH), the first enzyme in the degradation pathway. Because ethanol has nearly 100 times more affinity for ADH, it blocks the breakdown of ethylene glycol into glycolaldehyde, thus preventing further degradation to oxalic acid and the associated nephrotoxic effects.\n\nLiterally drinking booze is the antidote. I love it.",

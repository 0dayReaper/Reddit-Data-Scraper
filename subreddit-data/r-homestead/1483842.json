Do any of you leave them access to food all day?   Will they overeat if I do leave them food all day? Thanks",

I find it keeps them busy for longer and they\u2019re less likely to get bored and root around to much and get out. Also I have some big pork chops at the end of the year\u2026down size is it gets spendy",

In comparing the all day food to chickens, I can leave my hens food out all day and I don\u2019t see any difference in feed cost. If I let the meat chickens eat all day they would eat and poop it out with out even moving from the feed dish.",

You aren\u2019t running a sanctuary. Your pigs are not pets. They are food. \n\nThat being said? You get what you offer. You want good tasting meat? You raise happy pigs like they are your pets. Never knowing that they are food. As far as they know? They are a part of your family. Your tribe.  Pigs are smart, but they aren\u2019t smart enough to see the lie for what it is.\n\nIf you can\u2019t compartmentalize? You shouldn\u2019t be trying to raise your own food. It\u2019s hard to slaughter what we love. And pigs are super loveable. As well as super smart. They know when they are being led to their death.",

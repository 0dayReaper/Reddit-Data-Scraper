Sheep do better on lower quality forage/pasture. They can twin frequently. And they have a faster turn around if you want your money back faster. Not to mention the lower cost of the animals to get started + being much easier to manage than a cow. I could get up if a ram knocked me over, maybe not from a bull. Sheep could also help clear up some of your brush &amp; such to help develop more pasture. Not to mention you could move lambs around in dog kennels in the back of a truck\n\nBeef is the queen table fare for a homesteader from what I see and everyone wants a steer in the freezer. You could get cows &amp; enjoy the process and the shear amount of meat you\u2019d get, just takes a bit more patience. Thanks to the size of them you really don\u2019t have to sweat predators too much except with calves. And it\u2019s a much larger market for ribeyes than lamb chops. \n\nI personally would run sheep just because of their ease of entry, but do what you want to do, it\u2019s your land, your call.",

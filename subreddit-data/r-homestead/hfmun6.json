I think that\u2019s the most realistic way to move into the right direction. We own an autism treatment clinic and we have a rental property as well, which are our main income streams. We\u2019re not living 100% off our homesteading efforts but we\u2019re moving in that direction and not in much of a rush to. \n\nWe\u2019re not experts, by any means. We\u2019ve only been living out here for a year, and I\u2019m not too proud to say we\u2019re still learning as we go. We just stuck to our plan and a lot of things also went our way. God really had his hand on everything that happened leading up to our move, honestly. \n\nYou\u2019re definitely on the right track, though. Don\u2019t deviate from the plan you all have made. It will take time and commitment, before and after. As far as resources, I looked at a lot of content on this sub and just did a lot of local property searches. I have some titles of a few books that I can send you also.  \n\nFinally, thank you for the compliments about our family! We\u2019re not perfect at all we just really, really love animals! \n\nGood luck to you and your family on your journey.",

It has taken about 2-4 shocks before she decides to leave the painful electro-ducks alone and I've had to do it each time I get a new batch.\n\nIt sucks to hurt my baby...   but coming home to a half dozen teenage duckling strewn about the yard hurts too.\n\nTo each their own of course.  But it has worked for me and allows them all to be in the same fenced in area so when something else decides to jump the fence for dinner she has been around to stop it.",

It was SUPPOSED to be celery and black eyed susans in the containers, but I dunno what happened. The dirt in the containers was fresh from the bag Jungle Growth Fruit &amp; Veg mix back in February, but the seedlings I've been watching sprout since then have turned into fuzzy leaves like your plant.",

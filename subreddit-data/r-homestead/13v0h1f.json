    "postText": "Hey All \nHoping for advice. My property is fairly flat with a slight decline as you go towards the back. The house sits closer to the front and some water in the basement. I have noticed an issue with water collecting on the front yard after a heavy rain (lot is mostly old fill and was once a dairy farm). Looking for quick and easy drainage ideas along the front porch. I have looked up multiple products but want a long term solution. Ideas? Pictures? \nThanks!",

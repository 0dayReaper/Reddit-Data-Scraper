    "postText": "Is the juglone effect of walnut trees sufficient  to keep other tree species from colonizing a clearing? I have a large clearing bordered by a forest of young alders, poplars and birch, all of which pretty aggressively try to reclaim the clearing. \n\nI keep hearing about the juglone in walnut trees keeping things from growing under them, but is it enough to discourage root spreading trees like Alders? I have some walnut trees coming in soon, and I'm considering planting them along the edge of the clearing as a biological fence. Does anyone have experience with this?\n\nEdit: Juglone, not jugalone. Walnut trees are unaffiliated with the insane clown posse.",

I have quite a few native black walnut trees, and I can't say that they are an effective barrier, as I do keep the brush/saplings somewhat trimmed under them.  That said, there is not nearly as much under them.",

They grow quick and are very resilient as well as delicious\n\nWalnuts are messy and difficult to contain plus there are likely better options for native diversity. Consider checking with your local university extension service, that's how I got into the Hazelnuts as I was able to get 40 for free to encourage reintroduction as hedgerows",

            "comment": "I think it depends a lot on the undergrowth.  A friend has a (relatively massive) walnut and it suppressed most of the local scrub fairly well, and you can actually see the english ivy fade out as it hits the drip line.  There is some small stuff that grows but there's more grass under there and less brush than under the rest of that patch of his more or less equally dense forest (the rest is oak and cottonwood with a few conifers so arguably might let in a bit more light but not hugely).  So I think it probably depends a bit on the brush, I'm not sure how significant the effect it would be on alder... maybe a bit cause the cottonwoods (which are *waves hands at how closely related*) don't seem as interested in living there.  This is a black walnut which, I believe has more than some of the other varieties...",

            "comment": "The shading impact of the mature walnuts will have a substantially larger impact than the juglone impact. go walk around the woods in Upstate NY or similar forests. The walnuts are pretty seamlessly interspersed with the rest of the trees.\n\nWalnuts are great for lots of reasons (good nut crop, hard wood, pretty!) But they're not going to give you any sort of vegetation force field.",

Seems like it's been somewhat overstated. \n\nThat said, the plan remains more or less the same. I'm going to have them along the edge of the field because they need a lot of space and look nice; if they help keep the forest back it's just a bonus.",

I have not observed interaction with any of the plants you mentioned.  Yellow poplar is not affected but pine will die.  Hackberry is not affected.  One of the more interesting observations I have made is that raspberry is resistant but blackberry isn't.  We are marginal for raspberries and all the drainages around here with raspberries also have black walnut trees.  I don't think the raspberries would out compete the blackberries without the black walnut.",

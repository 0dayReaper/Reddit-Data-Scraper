    "postText": "Need some advice here.  I love the city, but my husband is is definitely a country boy.  He has relatives with an ancestral farm up North, but he grew up in Suburbia.  He drives a truck.  His ideal is owning a lot of land, riding a 4 wheeler, and being far away from everyone.  I grew up in a small town and hated being so far away from everything.  I lived in two major cities before meeting him.  We live in a mid-sized city now but keep conflicting over our permanent lifestyle.  I want to move back to a major city with public transport and ability to walk to everything I need.  He wants to buy some acreage 30 min away from the closest grocery store.  We urban homestead right now and I do enjoy gardening and providing for ourselves.  Have a lot of animals that I'm sure would love the space and would want to get some farm animals.  So I'm pretty much a 60% big city/40% country split.\n\nSo, my question for you city folk turned homesteaders out there:  Do you ever miss the city or regret being so far out?  I want my husband to be happy and considering my split I feel like I could make it work, but he is worried I would grow resentment.  Any homesteaders out there have city partners that converted and are happy?",

We both met in college, and ended up needing to find a compromise for raising our family. \n\n\nWe now live rural close to a college town (big university) an hour from a major city. It\u2019s a good compromise as the college town has all stores, restaurants, and everyday things we need. I am finding that unique about college towns. We can live our rural life and then drive an hour, hope on a plane and be anywhere in the world we want.",

But would go to to my friend\u2019s country place from time to time to help him with projects and to enjoy being out of the city for a while. I use to go to baseball and hockey games. I would go to concerts and live theater. I would eat in some absolutely fantastic restaurants. Thanks to Covid I was offered early retirement and jumped on it like a fat kid jumping on a Twinkie. We already had the country place and sold everything we had in the city. I\u2019ve been down here for full time for 2 1/2 years and don\u2019t miss the city one little bit. I don\u2019t have to listen to the neighbors arguing or kids stereos as the drive down the street at 3am. If my dog barks nobody cares. I lost all interest in sports when they decided to get involved politics and social issues. So I don\u2019t miss that part. I haven\u2019t even locked my front door in two years. My life is extremely laid back now and I love it. \n\nI\u2019m to the point where I dread the thought of going to St. Louis regardless of the reason. So you could say not only do I not miss the city, I actively avoid it. On a side note. Since I moved here my blood pressure is down significantly. I know part of that is being retired but I also attribute part of it to the low stress life of the county. Yesterday my wife and I just sat on the porch enjoying adult beverages as the sun went down. No TV, no radio, no electronic devices. Just enjoying each others company watching the Guinea hens run around the yard. And the sky after dark. I forgot just how many stars are up there without all the light pollution.",

            "comment": "Love Off The Grid sounds like it'd be a fun watch for you two.  (It's trash tv but it might spark points to discuss and if you turn it into a drinking game where you do a shot every time someone says a glaring red flag, it's kinda fun).  HomeGrown is also a cool show where she focuses on urban homesteading type stuff and has her own urban homestead in atlanta.  You never know what might sway hubby to lean more your way and try to do it all in the city.\n\nIn all honesty, it sounds like you're most worried about convenience but not necessarily concerned for the social aspect of things?  Usually the concern for people is more \"I'll miss the nightlife/activities/hustle and bustle.\"  But your post sounds most like you'll just miss the convenience.  So I would say maybe focus on that.  At least come up with some ideas of \"what's the farthest I'm willing to go for xyz?\"\n\nWe're an hour from a major city but because of the geography and topography of the area, you can have a very rural property almost up to the city limit.  Then there's a big ass mountain and then you're in town.  So one side of the mountain is rural, the other side is city.  But the drive between the two is maybe 15-20 minutes.  Granted, you pay for the convenience of acreage so close to the city which is why we're so much farther out lol.  But I'm sure those people really enjoy having their cabins and homesteads so close to town.\n\nI would also point out that with the right setup, you don't need to be within walking distance of everything.  We sacrificed a guest bedroom for a giant pantry so we can have a couple chest freezers and extra dry storage because it's such a long trip to the store.  I joked with hubby that the pantry will be like our own little convenience store.  And everything else can basically be delivered if you can wait two days or think of it 2 days in advance of needing it.  So even then, you're not losing a huge amount of convenience due to location.\n\nMaybe just do some thought experiments on what your limits are.  Is it about the distance/time you have to travel?  Is it about the limited convenience?  Is it about the social restrictions?  Is it something else?  \"If I couldn't get to town for 2 weeks but had plenty of food and water and whatnot, how would that feel?  If I had plenty of land to stroll or hike but I couldn't walk to the store, how would I feel?  If I always had to drive everywhere but we could have more animals, how would I feel?\"  And just keep going.  And keep hubby in the know.  We play the \"what if\" game all the time.  \"Hey, I was thinking 'what if xyz happened?' and I realized I'm NOT ok with option A but I'd be cool if we did B.  What do you think?\"  or \"If I realize that my real issue with being so far out of town is that I hate to do that kind of driving, will you commit to being the default driver.  I'll do it sometimes, obviously, but all things being equal, that's a you problem on any given day?\"  You never know, he may just love the country driving.  \n\nThat's basically how we found our land.  \"I don't want to be more than X miles from where we are now.  Nor do I want to be more than 1 hour from a major city.\"  And I accepted the challenge.  Found property that met those requirements in our price range and we took the plunge.\n\nWe also just met a guy who's got like 60 acres in the suburbs of a major city.  Didn't get a chance to get details but he's running a horse ranch with guided trails and all that in the suburbs of cincinnati ohio.  I was amazed.  Especially because his road frontage is so narrow, you'd never guess he had so much acreage hiding behind there.  So set your parameters and shoot your shot.  You never know when you might just find that weird property that meets all your crazy criteria.  And if not, then you can start knocking things off the list.  But who's to say you can't find some weird little city abutting the city proper that has old rules on the books.  We found this tiny odd town in tx where no one seemed to have more than 1 acre but everyone had a horse or cow grazing in their fenced yards.  It was crazy to see just a normal neighborhood filled with ranch houses on acre plots and every house just had livestock roaming the yard.",

            "comment": "My two cents. I\u2019m a total city girl. (Okay maybe not city like NYC or LA but reasonable big city). We made a huge life change just over a year ago - bought land and altho we are not off grid, we are 35+ minutes to nearest grocery store. Our nearest town is 6 miles away, population of 600, which has a gas station, bank, post office and a Dollar General (of course!). I cannot see any neighbors from my house - most parcels out here are 10+ acres and way on up. It has been a HUGE change and I am still acclimating. I work from home, which I\u2019m grateful for BUT the downside is that I never see anyone other than my husband. I\u2019ve met a couple of people in town, but there\u2019s no socializing. Grocery shopping and errands take planning ahead. We have to have enough stuff (food, medications, etc) on hand in case of emergency. By the time I work an 8 hour day I\u2019m way too tired to consider going to the bigger city to do any sort of socializing (even if I knew anyone). These may all sound like negatives - and there are days the loneliness is overwhelming \u2026. But it is getting better and better.  And the upsides: we have all of our land to ourselves to do with what we want. No HOAs\u2026. No neighbors bitching\u2026. An entire zoo\u2019s worth of animals if I want\u2026.I can walk around in my backyard nekkid if I wanted to \u2026. We can start building our little homestead and do what we want when we want. And I\u2019ve had time to get back to the basics, enjoy the things that I enjoy like reading and quilting. We are expanding our cooking skills since we eat almost every meal at home. In fact, I am going back to my hometown soon for a visit and I\u2019m kind of dreading the traffic and rules \u2026.",

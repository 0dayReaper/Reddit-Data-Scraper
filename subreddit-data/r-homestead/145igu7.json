Wood chips work fine, look better, and soften the soil enough to make weeding easy work. Just grow some tame shady ground cover. Id pull that up before it\u2019s buried in mulch. It\u2019s silly to think you can have zero yard maintenance. Just mulch and go over the whole area one a year to remove undesirables. That\u2019s all it takes.

Worms, bacteria, mycelium, air and water have to stay in balance for healthy plants.   This kills all the above.   If you're doing it for weed control then take a natural approach and plant grass.   Good thick grass prevents weed growth in good soil.  In bad soil you want dandelions for the first few years mixed in with the grass.   As the soil gets better the grass will push out the dandelions.",

It's difficult to control weeds in the tree row without damaging the trees in an orchard setting, so some places use plastic like that to make it easier. Since it's only 18-24\" wide, it doesn't really bother too much.\n\nPersonally, I grew up with grass orchard floors, and I'm used to not worrying about it (grass whip or scythe it every month on a small scale, and there are under-vine trimmers for tractors for larger acreage)",

    "postText": "Is there such a thing?  It has the pin not a ball hitch. I want to be able to use the mower\u2019s utility trailer for things bigger than my carts can haul but smaller then my big trailer around the farm. \n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t I just pull it with the mower? Because sometimes I need to get into places smaller than my mower can get into. It\u2019s a 52\u201d mower. Some of my gates are 48\u201d.",

            "comment": "If you have a wheel jack already (assuming it\u2019s what I think it is like a handle with wheels and hitch ball) you could just get a piece of flat bar steel drill two holes one to fit over the shank of the ball and one to pin the trailer to it. Then put the bar underneath the frame and you should be able to use it for both.",

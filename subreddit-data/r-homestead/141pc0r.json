After several months of rasing the animal, the never-easy task of dispatching, then the tedious task of processing, this is my time to reflect and feel proud. The soft hum of the motor, the thought of meals to come sizzling on the pan, it's a feeling like no other.",

Knowing YOU put that food on your table!   We process birds and rabbits frequently and will be doing our Buck goat as soon as his kids are born most likely.",

For meat we also raise rabbit, chicken, turkey, and some duck. I have a friend that raises meat goats that wants to thin his heard a bit so sounds like we will have some goat soon. I've only had goat a handful of times but do enjoy it.",

I ordered a lamb prosciutto sandwich for myself and was asked (by female server ) if I liked lamb. I said yes very much. She said I will let you know if you can have a sandwich or not. She then offered me a very small slice of the lamb prosciutto to see if I actually enjoyed the flavor. After my reaction of oh my God is this insanely good!, she proceeded to make me a sandwich. I asked her why the test, her response was you'd be surprised at how many people think they like lamb. Lamb prosciutto is an excellent idea as well.",

I trap wild hogs and hunt deer, raise goats and chickens now days, so I bought a bigger grinder. Saves so much time. The kitchen aid ones are nice, but slow in comparison to one meant just to grind meat. That lamb sure looks tasty! You do good work",

Good on your dad for teaching you such a valuable skill at a young age and instilling that in you for a lifetime. I bet the bigger grinder is a like a dream. One day an upgrade will come then I can been blown away all over again by the speed and power of it.",

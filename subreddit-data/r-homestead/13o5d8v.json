    "postText": "\r\nI have an old logging road / dirt road up that goes to some property I own, the driveway is about 15' x 400' long with about 60' of elevation change to the top of the hill where a house will eventually be built.\r\n\r\n\r\nShort term plan to get better access to the top of the hill is to clean up the road and get it smoothed so the ruts and washout places are fixed, and put some kind of rock down so 2wd vehicles can make it up the hill. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy father in law who is an old school farmer swears redrock is the way to go, but everything I have seen on line or other people I have talked to  recommends 57 stone or gravel.\r\n\r\n\r\nFiL says the gravel will wash away faster than the Redrock.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dirt is a sticky clay texture.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny suggestions, or other options anyone can recommend?",

Climate depending- snow &amp; ice are the worst bc you can't really shovel it and I just slide backwards. It's in the trees so it takes forever to melt. I don't have an answer, but these are my struggles w gravel steeper sloped drive. I don't have the budget to pave at this time so we just deal with it. It's not horrible, winter sucks sometimes, but I'm honestly unsure if paving is the best option either.",

Compact it when it's wet, then if you can find someone who will bring asphalt millings for a few hundred bucks a triaxle you can make an almost proper road with just a skid steer, plate compactor and a few thirty packs.",

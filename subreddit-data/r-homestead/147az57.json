You might have more choice there, some places also sell compost and garden soil, etc.\n\nGet on Google Maps or whatever and search for \"mulch yard\".\n\nCut down a tree on your property and rent a wood chipper to process it.",

I fill my trailer with limbs and stuff and bring home double ground mulch.  \n\n\nIt's the exact same mulch the landscape stores use around here to sell in bulk.  They just buy it by the truckload.",

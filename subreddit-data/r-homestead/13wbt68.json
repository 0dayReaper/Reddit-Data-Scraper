Chessies can also have ear floofs like that if they possess the long hair gene. If that's sister behind her then she looks more aussie. Duck tolling retrievers are shorter stockier dogs. They're shape is a bit funny honestly because they're a little longer than they are tall but not basset short. Chessies can also have the masking like the sister does behind her though. I lean aussie though.",

The domestic food samples were collected from 35 states, and imported food samples were collected from 79 countries/economies; 87 different domestic foods and 299 different imported foods were tested and assigned to one of six commodity groups. The food samples were also tested for compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) pesticide tolerances; 96.8% of domestic and 88.4% of imported foods were found to be compliant with federal standards.\"\n\nThe foods with the most exposure overall both for domestic and imported foods are:\n\n Raspberry fruit/juice - 95.8% (bothers me that that's def a blackberry lol)\n\n Peach fruit/juice - 92.9%\n\n Cucumbers - 85.2%\n\n Hot peppers - 85.1%\n\n Celery - 83.9%",

The proof is based on population studies instead of randomized controlled trials (which would be unethical) so it isn't nailed down as tight as many scientific theories.  Maybe we could get all the antioxidants we can use from the black pepper used on our bacon and all the fruits and vegetables we consume are superfluous.  I just don't see people arguing that way.    \n And this doesn't stop me from avoiding pesticides in my own garden.  Or wishing farmers could get their product to market without any pesticides.",

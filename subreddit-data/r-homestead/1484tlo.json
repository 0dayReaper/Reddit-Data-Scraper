    "postText": "I had 4 baby chicks that are now teenage chickens. I\u2019m wondering - what\u2019s the safest and smartest way to introduce them to my 3 adult hens? The 4 young ones are about 1/3 or 1/2 the size of the adults. My boyfriend and I built them a small temporary coop that we have in the garage, but they\u2019ve since outgrown it and we\u2019re wondering what precautions we should take introducing them to our existing chickens. The adults have a coop, and a small fenced/covered area. Only worry is about the little ones being bullied but the adults, and potentially harmed. \n\nFor context - we have birds the size of doves that fly into our chickens coop often, and they hangout in there, our chickens don\u2019t seem to mind them at all. I\u2019m sure it will be fine, but wanted to double check before introducing. We live in Hawaii and have had plenty of issues with the mongoose and have lost chicks before, don\u2019t want anything to happen to these little guys! (We have since mongoose-proofed all our livestock areas, no issues since.) \n\nAny and all advice welcome! And, if anyone knows how to tell if the young chickens are male or female, would love to know that too before introducing. Don\u2019t need any more chicks running around. Thank you in advance!",

            "comment": "What we did was put the new birds in the coop after dark. We did it with very little light. And we made sure that the coop door was opened before the sun came up. Mixing this way sometimes fakes the older birds out in thinking that the new birds had been there for a while. It made setting up the pecking order a lot less shorter.",

Having a rooster is a bonus because he will intervene if it gets too bad. \n\nOut of the 10 or so times we introduced chickens,the only time we had issues was introducing older hens with other older hens while there was no rooster present. Both groups thought they should be in charge and it was brutal.",

Again, laws vary by state, but in WV roosters are allowed free access to their daughters at all ages.  Roosters are also known to be very close to their mothers, even fighting their fathers for the right to sex them.",

            "comment": "So chickens take their pecking order very seriously. The biggest risk to younger, smaller birds is injury while they sort that social order out. Ideally you want the chickens to be the same size because that way there is the smallest risk of injury.  Pecks, kicks, wing beats can kill little birds. \n\nGo slow. If you can, put your pen by the adult birds so they can \u201cmeet\u201d and after a few days let them be in the same space and keep an eye on them. A supervised visit basically. Take your time. It took a few weeks before I could leave my smaller birds with the big girls. Keep them separated by a fence if you can at first. \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid if you see some mean behavior while they sort out their new pecking order. Pecks on the wings and jumping at one another is pretty normal. You might also see some aggressive crown head gestures where they swipe their crown in the dirt. Just observe and make sure they\u2019re all eating and drinking from the feeders. \n\nWhat you don\u2019t want to see is older birds chasing and pecking, patrolling for little birds to bully, or rapid/repeating pecks, or keeping little birds away from food.",

            "comment": "As soon as the little ones are ready to go outside, put them somewhere that the big chickens can see them but not get to them. We put a dog crate in the chicken run and surround it with hardware cloth tacked to a frame. Leave them like that for 2-3 weeks, until they are all basically ignoring each other. Then, after the morning feeding one day, leave the barrier open. Bonus points if the littles can go in and out but the bigs can\u2019t fit. Let explorations happen but keep them separate at night and feed separate in the morning for another week or two. Then start putting the littles to bed in the coop, but still offering food in multiple feeders spaced far enough apart that the adults don\u2019t take over all of them. They won\u2019t fully integrate and eat together until the little ones are full grown, so other than teaching the littles to roost, you basically just keep doing separate feeders for a few months (or you can just use one and let the littles wait their turn, but I prefer to give them their own.)",

Every time I\u2019ve done it this way, when I finally allow access, there\u2019s a little bullying the first few days, but it\u2019s never serious, usually just a peck here and there and big ones gatekeeping the food. They all get along pretty well after that.",

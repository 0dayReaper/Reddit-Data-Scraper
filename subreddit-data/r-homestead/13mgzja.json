    "postText": "I've heard that you can raise them together but people have mentioned  not feeding ducks medicated feed. \nWe plan on purchasing chicks and ducks from local people, so they aren't vaccinated. I was told that we can feed the chicks, and then later mature chickens medicated feed, but we can't feed ducklings(ducks) medicated feed. We would have to feed separately which is silly as im sure they will eat each others food. \nI know that I can buy a flock feeder for all birds, but it's not medicated so.... \nIs medicated really that important? Should I buy chicks from a hatchery and get them vaccinated and then not worry about medicated feed? Feed sperate starter feed and then as mature ducks/chickens switch to medicated? \nAfter a huge long wait our dream is coming true and we are planning on getting chicks/ducklings next spring. Just being myself and learning all the things to be as knowledgeable as I can.\nThank you all in advance!",

            "comment": "So you can use a Flock Raiser, which is kind of an all purpose  chicken, duck, turkey, etc. But chicks and ducklings need different things when growing. It's very critical you give your duckling the niacin they require or they'll have all sorts of health issues like not being able to walk. A way around this is to mix some brewers yeast in the feed, or get feed specific to ducks. \n\nAs far as medicated or non-medicated, I started out on medicated when I first got them, then switched to non-medicated once they started to mature a little. But that wasn't for any particular reason.\n\nI keep my ducks and chickens separated. Ducks make a mess of any water accessible to them. And will make a mess of their food container. The chickens do not. But the chickens will peck anything that's different i.e. the ducks. \n\nAlso because they are smarter and more curious your ducks will cause you way more grief and way more work than chickens. Ducks are escape artists, mess makers, and food wasters. But are also way more entertaining and enjoyable to watch. All of mine have noticeable personalities, the chickens not so much. \n\nDucks roost and nest on the ground, the chickens like nesting boxes and to be high at night time. Chickens will go inside the coop when it gets dark on their own, ducks will not.\n\nIf this is your first time there's going to be some trial and error. I recommend raising them and keeping them separated, because they are so different in every way. But I'm just some stranger on Reddit with an opinion, and opinions are like butt holes, we all got em. \n\nGood luck on the adventure.",

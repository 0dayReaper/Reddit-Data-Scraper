    "postText": "We live on about 6 acres in the Pacific Northwest. Last few years fires have really become an issue here in the dry months. This is our first year on the property and I\u2019m wanting to do a bit of cleanup in some old growth forest up on our hill. I\u2019ve never had to do this sort of work before and it\u2019s pretty obvious to me that the previous owners never cleared out any fallen trees, because there are quite a few down. Is there some general guideline as to what I\u2019m supposed to be clearing out? Am I literally supposed to be clearing out all the fallen branches and whatnot? Or is it mostly just the downed tree trunks? Obviously I\u2019m leaving anything that has mostly decomposed, and I\u2019m moving straight small trees as trail liners.",

            "comment": "Everything below at least 8' high under trees should mostly go, ditto any dead limbs that are even higher (up to say 13-15' or so which is about as high as it's \"easy\" to get with a pole saw).  Smaller trees ofc need to be worked up a bit at a time, but if it's old growths a) there probably aren't a lot of those and b) they're likely mostly not interesting to keep except for some infill patches.\n\nThe downed trash is kind of a catch-22.  Stuff like forest duff (needles, leaves, etc..) and punky old logs are GREAT for forest nutrition BUT they can also be a place for smouldering fires to get ahold.  Historically most of that would have burned and returned some of the nutrition to the soil as ash.  I've been taking an intermediate approach and burying some of it into hugelkultur beds which can kind of mimic riparian areas due to increase moisture retention allowing me to put in some herb and fruit beds in places that wouldn't otherwise support it.  Some still gets stacked and burned but I'm trying to minimize that.\n\nBe extra careful with half down and standing dead trees, lots of people have died removing those.\n\nIdeally trees are thinned to sparse copse's with at least 20-50' of open ground (or more) between bunches so crowning fire can't as easily jump from bunch-bunch.  Start near buildings and work your way out, this will likely take multiple years to address.\n\nThere are a few exceptions to clearing, look up firewise plants (the PNW is .. a pretty wide range of ecosystems so I'm going to wave my hands a bit here).  Rhododendron's and lilacs for instance basically don't burn and can actually be used as fire barriers (overhanging conifers are still bad ofc), vine maple, mock orange, and oregon grape mostly don't burn well and you can largely leave them as long as they aren't to thick.  Grass burns fast but doesn't go UP the same way so as long as it can't ladder into the trees it's not good .. but it's also not quite as bad.  Poison oak is bad when it burns because of the fumes which can blister your eyes and lungs...  Goats are the answer there I think, we've tried spraying and digging it but .. yeah.. it's persistent.\n\nOne thing to consider is that in wind the flame front can be 1.5-2x or more as far out as the plants are tall.  So a dense forest of 50'+ trees can have flame fronts 100-200' out in front of them, but a grass fire might only have a 2-4' flame front.  This makes it easier to add physical barriers (rock walls, non-flammable hedges, etc..) between lower plants and critical structures.\n\nAlso consider doing the easy fixes to firesafe your buildings.  The CA building code is probably most developed in this regard (https://www.hcd.ca.gov/building-standards/state-housing-law/wildland-urban-interface/docs/2010-part-2-cbc-ch7a.pdf), in particular their guild lines for vent screening are really good (https://ucanr.edu/sites/fire/Prepare/Building/Vents/) as a lot of structure loss is due to wind blown embers which can travel for literally miles and often get sucked up into the updraft in building venting systems.   The other place to check is your outside decking, some older plastic decking would spread in fires and chimney, wood and most modern composite decking will swell if it starts on fire closing off the chimney (although excessive gaps in the deck can still end up having a similar problem).",

A lot of the ones a bit further north in OR at least have folks who are very happy to come out do an assessment and help ID what the immediate remediation priorities are.  This is usually either free or very very cheap.",

                            "comment": "There's a video I saw a few years back (and I wish I could find it again) where the fire dept did a controlled burn of a house that had a rhody growing where it was almost touching the house and while the house went up in an inferno of flames the one side of the rhody next to it was blackened but the other side stayed completely green.  It was an amazing visual that really stuck with me.\n\nI had some family go through a fire a couple years ago and at their neighbors house a similar thing happened with a row of lilac's, a big copse of trees went up like a tinder bomb and blackened that side of the lilacs but the dry grass on the other side of them didn't catch fire, and the dry firewood stacked against the house (roughly 20' away) didn't catch fire either.  We figure the line of lilacs probably saved that house.  Not that I'd rely entirely on that.. but as part of a fire barrier I was pretty sold on the idea.\n\nAbout 80% of the houses in a 10+ mile square area were burned in that fire.. some several days later when smolding grass or similar flared up and ran into them (one we saw looked like a thin line of grass caught and ran up into the siding) which kind of highlighted the importance of managed spaces around buildings.",

On my property all the tiny stuff is covered with green plants right now.   In reality this will only help if it's a small fire.   A big hot fire with wind will burn everything.  Green and dried.   It's more important to have a firebreak around your home and important buildings.   Most fire marshals want to see 100' of clear land around a home.   It protects the home in case of wild fire and protects the woods should you have a house fire.  Most people here in the NW have trees and bushes right next to their house.  This is a serious no no.",

As always consult experts and if you are unsure maybe hire a pro.",

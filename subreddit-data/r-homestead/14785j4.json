When I was a kid we had a skunk problem and would just catch them then drop the cage off our dock with a rope and drown them. Is that legal or would I get into trouble if I got caught?",

I don't own any guns and don't feel like going out to buy one when there are other ways of getting the job done. Is it more messed up than me missing a couple of times and just wounding it. Waiting period for a gun is 10 days. Should I just starve and let it sit in the cage until I get the gun? Also if it's shot I may get into trouble for hunting it without a license if it drowned I just say it fell in my pool and drowned so I threw it in the trash. So it may be a little more mean to the creature that is trying to kill my animals, but for me I see many positives to just drowning the bastard.",

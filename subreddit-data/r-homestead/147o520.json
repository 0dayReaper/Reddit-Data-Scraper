The pressurization and release process is exactly the same regardless of whether you are cooking or canning. Only difference is if it\u2019s sold primarily as a cooker, it might not come with a trivet to keep jars off the bottom, but you should be able to find something that will work if that\u2019s the case.",

I have an outdoor burner, like for a turkey fryer, and we use that.  Keeps the house from getting too hot or messy.  \n**Presto\u00ae 16-Quart Pressure Canner and Cooker 01745**\n\nLook on Marketplace and you can probably find several used ones.",

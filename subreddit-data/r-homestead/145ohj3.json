    "postText": "I have an area that I'm trying to fence in a way to keep out the local foxes and raccoons. The raccoons I'm not as worried about, as I'll have a self opening and closing door to keep the chickens in at night. The foxes however, are out in the evening and morning for a bit even when the sun is out, and I'm afraid that they may try to break in during that time, as they hang out not too far away from the coop. We have 6 chickens, and the area I'd like to fence is about 40x30.. The two 30' sides are up against buildings, so I'm not worried about fencing those areas, I just have two 40' areas that I need to fence. Any tips on how to do that economically? I think it would be pretty expensive to put wire over the top, but I'm also having trouble coming up with a practical fence that can keep foxes out that doesn't involve electricity.\n\nI was thinking of building a 6' tall fence that leaned out at the top the last foot or so, but that might be a bit hard to support all the way up there. Any thoughts or tips? Maybe I need to bite the bullet and just get a few hot wires around the top. I don't want to spend a money on a unit to power the electric fence, and my almost toddler likes chickens so I'd rather not have that at ground level so no accidents happen. But that may be the best option that doesn't involve building the next Berlin wall. Any and all tips on wall construction or materials are welcome.\n\nEdit: I am going to put some hardware cloth on the ground so they can't dig under, and use wire that they cant break through on the bottom few feet",

Basically make a cube that\u2019s all secured together so there\u2019s no way for them to get in, they\u2019re crafty little bastards.\n\nPersonally, we just got some guardian dogs for the foxes and coyotes and don\u2019t have to worry about them at all as the dogs outweigh any of them by 10x",

Top, sides and a 2ft dig barrier that connects to the bottom of the sides and laid flat on the ground.  Fox and raccoon here as well as other predators. Only mice have gotten through.  A 160 lb Bloodhound can bounce off the sides, my idiot dog. I have a solar powered fence charger from tractor supply for my garden so there's an idea for you also.  Pictures of coops and runs are on my profile of interested.",

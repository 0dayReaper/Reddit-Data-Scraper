Just wondering if anyone has any advice, stuff to look out for/considerations when homesteading or buying land in this area. I've lived in Eastern North Carolina for a few years so Im pretty used to the climate and area.",

The family business has taken over they are popping them out and the land that seems for sale is already dedicated to the cumming pricks that live here. I hope you enjoyed your tour of hell come back soon ya hear!",

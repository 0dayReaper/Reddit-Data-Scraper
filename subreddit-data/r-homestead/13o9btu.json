My wife swears she found one loose in the front yard when we had to move our gas line. \n\nThe previous owner would have probably had plenty of this core drill waste at his disposal. Now I just have to decide if we bust it up or not.",

If you have a stone path or driveway you could bust them up but it takes a long time to do by hand.  I'd either bury them again or find a gravel materials company that will crush and repurpose the dust.",

We started last year with a pair of African geese to protect our flock. And now we have 12 geese. Yes, you have to change their water every day. And yes, they can be messy. But our geese are our smartest and most loving birds. They are loud, they talk alot, and will have \"conversations\" with us. But we would not go back. If you want geese for protection, and you want a quieter Brees, go with buffs.",

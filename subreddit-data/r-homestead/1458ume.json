I'm getting some results now with minor irrigation, but my dad and uncles told me to cover crop it with oats or winter wheat/rye next year. It took me almost 3 weeks and a lot of grass clipping mulch to get any sign of life, so you might be surprised if you get some rain soon.",

A good test is to dig a hole.  How many bugs, worms and mycelium is present?  I would do a ph test as well.",

Here in Michigan spring was very short. We have went almost a month without rain which is unheard of this time of year. Needless to say I have struggled to get grass seed to grow even with bi-weekly waterings.",

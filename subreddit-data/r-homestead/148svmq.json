    "postText": "Hello reddit, first post here. I've got a small farm and am looking to purchase a tractor to do some of the larger jobs. I've found two close by and am torn between which to get. \n\nThe first is a John Deere 2010 model that has been completely rebuilt and comes with a lot of spare parts. It runs well with just under 500 hours on the rebuilt engine and transmission and is fairly close by. It is a 4 cylinder gas engine. Cost $6500\n\nThe second is a 1974 Ford 3000 series. It runs well too, but has not been rebuilt. Just over 4800 hours on the engine. The engine is a 3 cylinder diesel. It is a little bit further away than the JD. Cost $5000.\n\nI'll primarily be using the tractor to make hay and brush hog. \n\nI'd appreciate any advice as I am new to owning this size of tractor.",

The main tractor comprised by an engine, box and back end topped off with a seat is all one needs. A 35 or 135 would suit you greatly and they just keep on gaining value so a good investment.",

You're taking on hundreds of dollars a month in payments plus any repairs needed not covered by warranty are out of pocket.  \n\nIt's an option, but I don't think it's the best one for many (most?) People. And I'd recommend getting a Kubota instead, if you were going to do it.",

                            "comment": "I have recently bought a new subaru car for about $30k,  I also just recently bought a new kioti tractor, the tractor itself was about $20k but i got a lot of e tra attachments so the total amount was about $30k. However monthly payment on the car are about $800/month for 7 years m, whereas my monthly payment for the tractor and attachments is like $250/mo for 7 years...less than half of the car, due to the 0% financing which is currently available with no down payment, despite that the sticker price is roughy the same.\n\nIn the last 2 years, the purchasing power of the us dollar has dropped by about 50% due to inflation - so a $30k purchase today is roughly equivalent to a $60k purchase 2 years ago. The dollar value is going to continue dropping over time so by the time i pay off the $30k debt in 7 years, $30k will be a lot less money then than it is now.\n\nIn contrast, a $6000 cash purchase today would have a much greater financial impact over the next 7 years because that's $6000 of TODAYS dollars whereas the $30k tractor will be paid using future dollars which are worth less than todays dollars due to inflation",

The 135 and similar tractors punch above their weight. Parts are cheap, plentiful and the tractors are easy to work on.\n\nFind one in good shape - check the hydraulics (And PTO - on / off) before buying. I'd look for one with a loader on it - it's very useful.\n\nI picked up my 135 for $5000 Canadian (that's like 3500usd) with the loader on it plus a huge snowblower unit.",

Can probably get a rebuilt motor for 3k$. Think all the three cylinders were built in England. (?). But they are available in the US. Diesel has its plus and minus over gas but Deer stuff expensive.

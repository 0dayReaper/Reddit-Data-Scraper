I use:\n\n1 L (4 c) 10% table cream\n\n500 ml (2 c) 18% whipping cream\n\n300 g (1 1/2 c) sugar\n\n15 ml (1 T) bourbon vanilla extract\n\n\nas the base then add:\n\n250 g (~1 1/2 c) blackberries maserated with 25 g (2 T) sugar\n\nTo maserated the berries put them in a bowl and add the sugar then mash the berries with a fork. Let them sit for a few minutes then mash them again. I like some big chunks of berry in my ice cream so I don't overdo it but you can mash them at much as you like. I add the berries just before the ice cream is ready. That will slow it down a bit but you end up with a really nice, purple ice cream.",

Not none, but the whole thing becomes much less painful. Also, cut short lengths, because the weight on each thorn dictates how much it will puncture you if you get the angle wrong on holding it. I don't go over eighteen inches, usually only twelve. Talking to the bush helps me, I think it lets me focus so that I don't zone out and get careless.\n\nI don't wear gloves, they catch.

Even roundup barely touched them. You have to use chemicals that literally bare the earth for years. But then guess what is a first adopter as soon as it's worn off.... Blackberries and scotch broom.

My husband has spent the last 4 years trying to clear out blackberries. He even rented a bobcat at one point and just plowed through them in several spots. We have these giant rhododendrons that could be absolutely gorgeous,  but they are so thoroughly infiltrated with blackberry vines that I don't know if I'll ever be able to clean them up. After this experience, I have a hard time understanding why anyone would willfully and purposely plant blackberries. But I do certainly love picking them and cooking with them each summer.",

Darrow of the USDA began tracking down reports of a large, reddish-purple berry that had been grown on Boysen's farm in Anaheim, California.[4] Darrow enlisted the help of Walter Knott, another farmer, who was known as a berry expert. Knott had never heard of the new berry, but he agreed to help Darrow in his search.\n\nDarrow and Knott learned that Boysen had abandoned his growing experiments several years earlier and sold his farm. Undaunted by this news, Darrow and Knott headed out to Boysen's old farm, on which they found several frail vines surviving in a field choked with weeds. They transplanted the vines to Knott's farm in Buena Park, California, where he nurtured them back to fruit-bearing health. Walter Knott was the first to commercially cultivate the berry in Southern California.[4]",

You can go all day long with 4 batteries (2 in trimmer and 2 charging) and the Makita has plenty of power to run that metal blade. No need to ever worry about clogged carburetors, mixing 2-cycle gas, pull starting it, etc.  I had a beefy Stihl trimmer that was more powerful, but the Makita has plenty of power to get the job done.  Leave the dead canes to mulch the area and hit it twice a year (spring and fall).  Over time you\u2019ll knock them back.  More work than poison, but 100% less poison.",

I do the same thing, I leave the dead cane in place. If you chop it all completely down several times a year, you can actually deplete the root crowns of energy to come back and kill the plants and don't need to use poison or dig out the rhizomes. Then you're only left with years of seeds in the soil, and any digging you do do will bring them back. \n\n2-stroke motors can F off too. I have enough pets. A 36v brushless dc motor needs no maintenance and there is no blackberry cane it won't instantly cut with a 3-pointed steel blade. No mixing gas and oil, no fuel stabilizer, no running old fuel through my car, no cleaning the gas lines, no cleaning the carb, no yanking a cord, way less putrid emissions. Lighter. There is no need for more power, unless you want to go through inch-thick branches, even then that may be just a question of blade type.\n\nHerbicides like crossbow will kill them but it doesn't cause the big-ass stands of cane to evaporate or anything, they're still there, they just become a hard thorny trellace for the next year's cane generation when the seeds inevitably come up. You're doomed to seedlings for years any way you do it, but that's as easy as mowing.\n\nA purpose-built brush cutter is better ergonomically though.",

Battery motors need zero maintenance.  I\u2019ve cleaned carbs, replaced carbs, mixed gas, replaced starters, replaced gas lines, etc.  I don\u2019t need to be schooled on proper maintenance and why I\u2019d rather have a machine that needs none of it and gives me all the power I ask of.\n\nI also have a Makita chainsaw that I use 90% of the time I need to use a chainsaw, but I also own gas powered saws because that is a machine that battery power cannot replace the needed power that gas gives you.  So while I respect your opinion as it\u2019s valid for other tools, it gives me pause that you e actually picked up a Makita string trimmer and put it to the test.",

There are components to gas motors that need to be replaced over time, like fuel lines, spark plugs, carburetors, etc. regardless of maintenance.

But modern ones are pretty amazing, especially the 36V-40V ones with brushless motors. Don't knock them unless you've specifically tried one of the newer models.\n\nSaying they don't have close to the power of a gas machine just shows your ignorance. Obviously there are gas models that are very powerful, but the battery ones can go toe to toe with the mid-range gas machines.\n\nDepending on what I'm doing, I'll pick up my Makita string trimmer instead of my Stihl FS-131 because it's lighter and is ready to go instantly. I have a Makita 36V chainsaw and more often than not, I grab that instead of my Stihl Farm Boss. The reason I got the Makita chainsaw is because the arborist I hired to do a large tree pruning job used one and he told me it's amazing. If it's good enough for a guy who uses a chainsaw all day every day to do tree work, it's good enough for me.\n\nBut that being said, if what you have now fills your needs, that's great. But your opinion on battery powered tools is completely irrelevant if you haven't spent any time using them.",

You can't charge a gas powered tool from solar.  In the apocalypse you will run out of fuel.  You can also use the batteries for other things in a pinch.  \n\n\nGas powered tools and mowers also don't have emissions standards, so you're getting a lot more fumes/pollutants out of them than you would a car. And obviously if you care about greenhouse gases battery has the opportunity to be better.",

For firewood cutting, which is about 90% of what I need the chainsaw for, I almost exclusively use the Makita.  With a sharp chain, it\u2019s a dream.  That said, the saw chews through batteries much faster than the trimmer does and it helps to have a couple more in your rotation (say 6 batteries instead of 4) for continuous firewood cutting.",

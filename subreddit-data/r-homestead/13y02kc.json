    "postText": "So I\u2019m in the desert but I imagine this applies anywhere. I\u2019ve got my compost pile and right now I have to hand water it. I\u2019m hoping to set up a rain barrel and drip line to automate the watering a bit more. Problem is that the compost pile is way away from anything to keep pests away so there\u2019s no roofs or anything to collect rain water with. I was thinking about expanding my single compost box into a 3 bin system with a lean-to roof over top to collect rain water. Would love to hear your more experienced thoughts on this idea. Please feel free to share your setup if you also have a stand alone  compost/water collection system. Thanks!",

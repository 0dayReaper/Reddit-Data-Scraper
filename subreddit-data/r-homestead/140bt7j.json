    "postText": "(This is not a singles advertisement) I\u2019m a 49 y.o., single, female, work four days a week, moving to 10 acres in Northern CA from a city in CA.  This has been a life long dream.  I have a dog, two special needs cats, and nine chickens.  Instead of being jazzed, I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed with the long, challenging home/property purchase which just ended.  Presently in the process of executing the move which seems challenging with so many moving parts.  The house I find seems to have a serious mouse problem and the weeds have gone wild.  The previous owners/realtor stopped mowing/weed suppression months ago.  The house is kind of hot mess.  I\u2019m just overwhelmed with all the things that need to be addressed.  Previous owners the last the few years were busted after running a cannabis trimming operation.  Doesn\u2019t seem like they cared much about homesteading or home owning.  Any advice, tips, warnings are greatly appreciated.",

It is okay not to think about it.\n\nMake a list, prioritize it, and focus on the top couple of things. Dont worry about the rest. It can help to tell yourself, out loud, I'll work the rest later. \n\nSometimes, I have to just stop and focus on the moment. I take a deep breath, close my eyes, listen to the world around me, and know I'm already doing what I love/want to do and to enjoy the process.",

When I bought my camp/farm property, I paid someone $500 to come in and brush hog about 2 acres of land that used to be pasture but was overgrown with invasive autumn olive and multiflora rose. It would have taken me literally years to clear myself by hand. After they brush hogged it, I kept up with mowing it a few times a year and now there's an orchard and a veggie garden bed there. There are still some sections of land that I'm clearing myself, by hand, because there are native trees within the thicket that I want to keep. I can only do it during winter time, in the summer it's an impenetrable green wall.\n\nAnyway, it's absolutely worth paying someone to do work that you don't want to do or don't have time to do, so you can focus on the \"fun\" projects around the place.",

It\u2019s worth having water and soil tested, if it was a grow they can be pretty abusive to the water supply and ground. A lot of chemicals get used on the high volume grows. Also if they were doing indoor, go over the water and power in the house to make sure they didn\u2019t do any crazy shit to that. On my property there was a second house they had indoor in but had cut out before the house was repo\u2019d. when I bumped the pumps to turn the water on I flooded the second story because they had plumbed random waterlines for their watering and it turned into a 2\u201d firehouse all over the second floor. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude33",

Use it for your floors and kitchen for now if possible to keep them away from your food. \n\nJiffy *Honey* corn muffin mix (sold in a blue box at the grocery store for about $1) mixed with equal parts baking soda makes a mouse/rat killer that is totally cat &amp; chicken safe because cats &amp; chickens can burp/fart and mice/rats don\u2019t seem to be able to as readily so the baking soda kills them. Reduce the baking soda to 2:1 if you notice them no longer eating the bait. Dead mice can safely be consumed by the cats &amp; chickens, it won\u2019t hurt them. Hope this helps!",

The other alternative is to get rat and mice bait with an emmetic to get them. Ridents can't throw up but your dogs, cats and chickens can. It causes them to suffocate and they will go outside seeking air. Some may die in the house but most will go outside. \nSecond, get someone to mow the acreage then buy a mower to keep it cut.\nThird, relax as every job will get done. Maybe not quickly but it will get done. \nLastly, enjoy your life of freedom from the crap in the city.\n\nGOOD LUCK!!!!",

It's over. You've arrived. When you get to that glorious moment, the world turns. It's the start of a period of acclimation, where you welcome the natural world and it welcomes you back. Over weeks and months, you start to change as you fully realize what you've done. The magnitude of it doesn't hit until some time later, and you're standing outside, the crickets are chirping, the moon is high, a warm breeze comes up and washes over you - that's when it becomes real. When the mice problem is just a country problem. When the weeds are something to do eventually. When 101 projects you want to do become a point of fun and pride. Keep your eyes focused on that future moment, it will help with these final days of your escape from the city.\n\nSeparately, find a good local vet. There's plenty in the country that treat not just pets but farm animals, and if you can treat a horse, you can manage some special needs cats. Find that vet now so you can go meet them asap and get your babies in their records.",

Reality, though, means that you'll get those intrusive, \"oh shoot, I really need to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ tomorrow\" or, \"I forgot to pick up any \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" thoughts, and that's what I use my little notepad for.

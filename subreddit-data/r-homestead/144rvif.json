    "postText": "This past October my wife and I purchased our first home. A ranch style house on five acres. As each step progressed through obtaining the house, we drove by it once or twice, just to dream. We noticed what seemed to be a marker on a tree and we just kind of roughly assumed this was the property line. Once we officially purchased the home and moved in, our neighbors came over to introduce themselves and they were quick to inform us they \u201cremarked\u201d the property stake and a birch tree with red paint. After a few days passed my wife I and I decided to walk past and see the stake and tree. We noticed the stake itself is about 50-70 feet closer than we initially thought. We honestly weren\u2019t sure if this was right, although, there was the official stake next to the make shift stake that our neighbors added. It never sat right with me why he needed to define the line so quickly, boldly and even spray painted a tree that is technically on our property. His border even states that. These past few days I have thought about it again. I downloaded HomeSnap and walked to the property line. That line per HomeSnap is the stump with the original sign; where we originally thought the property line was. (Mind you, this sign was also taken down by our neighbor.)\n\nI know it is of note that you cannot take HomeSnap as gospel. It just seems to settle even less as well with me now. I stopped along markers visible on the gps on our property and my gps marker tracked with me nearly perfectly. I know that is correct. \n\nWhat should I do in this situation. I have no problem speaking to someone, although I do wish to stay in good graces with our neighbors as we plan to be here for forever. Is there another way I could vet this? It is also of note that the \u201cmakeshift marker\u201d was extremely easy to pull out of the ground as well as the \u201cofficial stake\u201d. That seemed fishy to me to as our house was built in \u201876 and the property lines have not changed since. So the fact that I could find the stake easily and it was not covered up makes me think. \n\nAm I being ridiculous? I really do not want to pay for a survey, but will if I have to. \n\nAny advice?",

People would come in with similar situations and we would give them a list of local surveyors to call. Sometimes people are misled by sellers where their property line is when they buy their property, sometimes they can't read and interpret their deed, and sometimes they will intentionally pull up pins and relocate them in order to gain more ground. Hard telling if your neighbor is being honest and thinks that is where the property line is or if they're deceiving you, but they're clearly wanting to have a known boundary set with you. I wouldn't even say anything to them about it and just hire a surveyor. Make sure you see exactly where they set your pins. And make sure if you ever decide to buy property again that you negotiate a survey to be provided in the sale, or at least pay for one yourself before buying the property!",

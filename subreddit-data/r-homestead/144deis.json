            "comment": "I did 2 acres with a 6ft landscape rake. You can angle it and it will kick up rocks and push them off to the side, on the next pass you just push the rocks you kicked up from the prior pass, eventually most of the big rocks will work their way to one side of the field. You still have to pick them up but a least they are in a line/ pile. Looking back I would look at getting a rear blade attachment instead since depending on the weather the tynes will only go 1 to 3iches into the ground while a blade will dig deeper. I thought that if I got a skeleton bucket, I could quickly grab the rocks but you end up with a bunch of dirt that's hard to shake off depending on the time of year.  Regardless cleaning a rocky soil field of all it's rocks takes time and patience, and when it rains the soil pushes more rocks to the surface so make sure to plant some ground cover like clover to help lock in the soil.",

We got it done, but there was plenty of fooling around too and took all day.  (Think kids between 8 and 13)",

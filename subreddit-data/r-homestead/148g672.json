    "postText": "So I have three different blueberry varieties (Northern High bush, Patriot, and, and Perpetua). The biggest issue is with my perpetua which is turning brown fast. I checked my soil PH and it is coming back as acidic enough for the blueberry. So Idk what I am doing wrong. Finally, my other two bushes aren\u2019t even flowering this year. I go no berries even growing which is weird. I didn\u2019t prune those two last December since I am unsure how to do so properly and that may have caused the issue, but idk. Any thoughts? TIA",

The berries are on the plant in the black pot?\n\nI'm having problems with growing things in (black) buckets and my theory is that the soil and the roots get too hot in the full sun, but also I had too much nutrients in the soil. Now that the rain flushed out the excess nutrients and I put the buckets close together so they're in eachothers shade, plants are doing a lot better.",

            "comment": "I have 3 varieties myself with 6 total bushes. All healthy thankfully!\n\nI have them all in wooden pots with well draining acidic soil.\n\nThe key thing with blueberries is paying attention each season to your canes (the long stems essentially)\n\nHow long have the plants been in these pots?\n\nDid you already use an acidic blend of soil or did you use some sort of acidifier to lower PH of another soil blend? \n\nCanes produce fruit- depends on the person but some people prune every 1-3 years. Canes will eventually stop producing fruit so cutting them back for new canes will cause new growth. However they should still be putting on leaf growth. \n\n1. Perpetua- Looks like a lot of dead canes. Trim a bit to check health. If they are brown/black inside. Cut the cane all the way down to the base. You don't want any of that to spread. You potentially have some sort of cane disease. Ensure you have some good draining soil. I am not a fan of plastic pots. Especially if you live in a rainy climate like me. \n2. Patriot- Those brown spots might be signs of disease. Maybe a rust disease. Has it been wet lately?",

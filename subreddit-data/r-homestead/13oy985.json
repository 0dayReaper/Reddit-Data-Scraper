    "postText": "Hello All\nSo into our 1st summer with our own paddocks, admittedly we dont know where to start.. the fields seem to be getting more weeds every day. How should we go about removing these and maintaining to keep them away? Please help with some step by step guidance on how to, and what tools / equipment we would need to get on a budget? Thanks!",

Since the plants your animals like to eat are slowly getting eaten to death, plants your animals don't like to eat are the only thing left that can grow there.\n\nGive your land a rest and when you put animals back on cut the stocking rate a lot.",

Certain plants indicate compaction, saturation or certain nutrient deficiencies. Having a soil test and understanding what animals you will have there at what times can help you make the right decisions about what plants to let grow and what you should remove or different ones you can seed",

All the support and well-wishing was completely unexpected. Thanks for all the kind words, and I\u2019ll do my best to respond to further comments. I have drone footage of the property I\u2019ll share once I get it edited!\n\nEdit #2: I added my Instagram to my profile. I posted a few more photos and will continue to do so as things progress!\n\nEdit #3: [360 Drone View](https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/v79yvp/heres_a_360_drone_view_of_my_93_acres_in_the/)\n\nFinal Edit: Well this went well :) It makes me so happy to talk with you and share my dream. A friend from HS I haven\u2019t seen in years saw the post and reached out! I love Reddit sometimes. Thanks again for the support, it\u2019s a huge motivator. Right now it\u2019s a little after 4am and raining. Kinda messed up todays plans. But hey, I don\u2019t need to water :) I\u2019ll keep you all updated! Best to all of you.",

One offer on the table is 50k a year and free electric for any buildings for a 20 year lease on 25 acres. Price goes down based on less acreage you are willing to give up. Could be a good gig for you up there. You're going to love it!",

We are in the process of trying to figure out if we will get a property tax cut because of it, but its not looking like it. NY is trying to go totally green, so I think that incentives have a lot to do with the business end of things. Also, land in NY is crazy expensive and a bit hard to come by. One reason we are considering this is because the tax rate where we are is so high, that its almost not worth keeping the property in the family if we will be eventually draining our bank accounts in taxes.\n\nThere are some serious downsides to this- its not like you get 50k and thats the end of it. You pay income tax on the money you get, you are losing usage of that land, you cannot hunt near the panels, you need to have open land for them (obviously) and finally, you have random people on your property doing maintenance, which I would imagine would be annoying depending on how much privacy you prefer. They are also a huge eye sore, imo.",

Lots of community and family support. \n\nIn terms of the growing season, I\u2019m working on an indoor setup (I have a 5000 sqft garage). It\u2019s going to be energy intensive, and solar is expensive, so that\u2019s a couple years away. My hope is I can produce enough for subsistence and a little extra to sell to local restaurants during the winter. That all being said, the 12 month growing season in California will be sorely missed. But at least I\u2019ll have plenty of (free) water here!\n\nTaxes on this land are extremely low since it\u2019s completely undeveloped. The first year or so I\u2019ll build small, non-permanent structures to avoid increased assessment. Additionally, this is a right to farm community, but collects a significant amount of it\u2019s tax base from the nearby lakefront properties (mansions). Generally the assessor goes easier on the properties being farmed\u2026 or so I\u2019m told. \n\nI\u2019d be interested to know where you end up, keep me posted!",

I paid about as much as this guy for half an acre and a house in a village. The cheapest land I can find in my country is still twice the price this guy paid and it's not even legal to build a house there, only do agricultural stuff. There wouldn't be any roads or utilities anywhere close anyway.\n\n\nI'm pretty jealous seeing the prices in the US tbh. I earn a fraction of what you guys earn and would still buy this kind of land in a heartbeat. 93 acres for 150k sounds insane to me",

    "postText": "Hey fellow gardeners! I've been considering switching to drip irrigation for my garden, but I wanted to hear from those who have already tried it. What are the pros and cons of using drip irrigation in your gardening? Does it really make a noticeable difference in plant health and water efficiency? Any tips or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "I recommend DripDepot for ordering. Setup requires some research but its worth every penny if you buy the right stuff. 6\u201demitter spacing built into the hose is ideal. Make sure your water quality (cant have sediment build up) and pressure is appropriate and add a pressure adjustment if necessary. Most importantly get a good automated programmable valve opener. Those things are magic. Suddenly all the watering happens perfectly all summer and you dont have to lift a finger.",

            "comment": "Cons: Upfront cost, effort to lay out, lines potentially in the way, some issues with water not getting to plants to far away from the line (depends on line &amp; soil), deciding what system(s) to use.\n\nPros: Less water usage, fewer weeds, better spot irrigation.\n\nI've gone to basically all 5/8\" drip tape (run downstream of 10-12PSI regulators) which scaled up pretty well to where I'm at garden size (25+ blocks at 50' each plus a bit of other stuff).  I've previously also used 1/4\" extruded lines and they work well for smaller spaces.  I soaked all of my lines in tubs with 1-2% vinegar (diluted from 30%) and some in 2% citric acid to get the scale off this spring and that seemed to help them (no noticeable difference in results between the two acids so I'll probably use citric going forward due to cost).  Most of my lines are on year 3 and while I've had to replace some they're generally hanging in there pretty well.  I've had some scaling issues with the 1/4\" extruded as well but similarly soaking them in vinegar worked to revive them.  The drip tape is a bit fragile so you have to be careful when weeding or raking around it to not cut it (you can patch it but there's a point of diminishing return vs replacing.. I use the shorter cuts to replace lines in smaller blocks).  The 1/4\" extruded is pretty sturdy (and also not to bad to patch) but doesn't work for as long of runs.\n\nThe 1/4\" laser drilled lines might work for someone but they've never worked for me.  If you have any water hardness or particulates they clog badly.  The \"soaker\" hose stuff that just kind of weeps from all over can work but also has issues with hard water clogging it, burying it in mulch so it never dries out worked better.\n\nI use some sprayers /misters on stakes for the herb beds as they tend to like a bit wider spread of water.  Those do need to be cleaned out periodically (we have some sort of bug that lays a pupae into the heads of them occasionally).\n\nI've had some difficulty getting some moisture sensitive crops (i.e. carrots, parsnips) to germinate well because my soil is crap clay and the water does soak sideways very well (the soil is a work in progress.. better every year).  We've largely solved that by doing various tricks to raise the humidity during sprouting by using row covers and/or boards during germination time and using mulch, compost, etc... to try to hold near surface water better.\n\nIMHO if you're sprinkling AND in a relatively dry area the reduction in aisle/side weeds and water usage makes it worth while.  If you're someplace that gets enough rain to get weeds anyway and have a lot of water.. maybe not (not sure I've never lived anywhere like that so extrapolating a bit heh).",

            "comment": "If you are a serious gardner you will have a drip system 100%. Now all depends where and what you want to plant. To properly use a drip system, you have to divide your garden plants according to there water needs, so you can set up different zones. For vegetable patches, I like using Drip Tape, but if you are a newbiew using a standard tube and soaker system make much more sense. Also, once you are done setting up a drip system, remember to mulch as it helps save water from evaporation. Set up drip watering time for morning or late evening this helps water loss from evaporation. Regularly check your system as well because sometimes critters, pets and birds damage it and it needs to be repaired.\n\nPlease don't buy cheap irrigation kits from Amazon. That stuff doesn't work. It breaks mid season and uneven watering of plants kills them, plus contaminates soil with all plastic. I recommend buying agricultural grade stuff and buy mine form [Dripworks.com](https://Dripworks.com)\n\nI recommend checking dripworks resources section ( [https://www.dripworks.com/resources](https://www.dripworks.com/resources)) for lot of free stuff and getting started. There drip planning guide is very helpful ( [https://www.dripworks.com/resources/drip-planning-guide](https://www.dripworks.com/resources/drip-planning-guide)) and also gallery of plans ([https://www.dripworks.com/gallery-of-plans](https://www.dripworks.com/gallery-of-plans)) will give you some ideas to brianstrom your set up.\n\nFor new ones I recommend using standard kits ( [https://www.dripworks.com/drip-irrigation/irrigation-kits](https://www.dripworks.com/drip-irrigation/irrigation-kits)) and easiest one is garden bed kit ( [https://www.dripworks.com/drip-irrigation/irrigation-kits/garden-bed](https://www.dripworks.com/drip-irrigation/irrigation-kits/garden-bed)). I recommend to start with the medium one. It waters 9 beds (4 x8).\n\nThey have a call center and offer some advice if you are stuck on some technical questions. You can also use tere paid design service (https://www.dripworks.com/design-service) if needed. I have used there gardenplanner ( [https://gardenplanner.dripworks.com/](https://gardenplanner.dripworks.com/)) which is free for 7 days and then there is annual fee after that. My needs were completed easy in 7 days.\n\nHope I have said enough.. thanks",

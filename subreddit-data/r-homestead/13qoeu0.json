Outside Probably could use some paint\n\nThat deck would be a mild concern to me. It's very low to the ground and looks weathered and a touch sagged in spots. If you can I'd recommend crawling down there with a flashlight and check for rot. Shouldn't smell like anything but fresh dirt.\n\nFor the interior, you can't say too much about the quality of the framing without tearing up walls. I would get close up to the wall with that flashlight and see just how flat it is. It's not a perfect metric by any means but seeing a really flat wall says good things about the frame underneath.\n\nThere's drop ceilings everywhere. The kinda look bad but they work to your advantage since it's likely you can remove a panel without causing any damage and physically see everything underneath.\n\nThe only structural worry I would have though is that deck. It's definitely worth investigating more just based on age and especially because of the sag. It probably wasn't built especially strong.",

            "comment": "It's a pretty house. In terms of just the house itself, assuming the foundation is solid and there aren't any structural issues, here is what I would ask an inspector to look at for me:\n\n\\- Get up in those ceiling tiles on the first floor and get a sense of how much DIY has been done over the years. You could get up there and find 70 year old wiring, wiring done by a drunk man in 1980, wiring that has degraded - you really don't know what's up there, so just having someone poke a camera up into those ceiling tiles will tell you a lot not just about the electrical situation but broadly how much DIY you can expect to find elsewhere. I'm still discovering old DIY situations in my house, and it makes me wonder just how much bathtub gin someone was swilling while daisy-chaining his way across the basement.\n\n\\- Look at the pipes. If the house was repiped in the 90s, you may have this shitty plastic stuff that at one time was the standard but has since proven to be brittle with age. How much copper vs how much plastic? If the house needs to be repiped, that's not an inexpensive proposition.\n\n\\- Termites. Again look up in the ceiling tiles. Ideally you could get a look behind the wood paneling but that will be tough to do. I'd have someone really creep around looking for pests. Rodents may also be an issue, depending on how well the house has been sealed up. There is always going to be some mouse in a country house, but when you have many mice you also get many snakes. Still, that's manageable. An existing termite problem would be a hard no for me.\n\n\\- Learn about the well, to the degree you can. Has it been tested? How clean is it? Is there an existing filtration system in the house? If not, that's a cool $5k I'd recommend you invest. Learn as much as you can about the water and water infrastructure.\n\nThose are the main things I'd recommend investigating before letting yourself fall in love with the house.",

            "comment": "My wife and I have been looking to build a homestead for a while and we've been holding out on a 3+ acre lot in a very specific geographic location -- basically the eastern edge of a smallish city where my wife's family lives. This property popped up and the land is gorgeous but I have concerns about the house. We're going to tour it tomorrow, but I'd also like to get some feedback from people that may have been in our situation. \n\nFor starters, I think it's prudent to talk a bit about myself and my family in order to provide some context. \n\n**Demographics**\n\n* Location - Midwest farm country, known for pigs and great soil\n* Age - Early 30s\n* Children - A 2 year old + at least 1 more in the semi-near future\n* Residence - Own a home in a town 40 minutes away\n* Work - Dual income WFH\n\n**Requirements**\n\n* Property - 5 acres in a rural town at most 20 minutes from a Target\n* Education - reasonably well regarded public schools\n* Housing - Either build or renovate a house while continuing to live in our current house, timeline approx 3 years\n* Finances - pay for house in all cash or near all cash\n\n**Homestead Goals**\n\n* Birds - ability to raise meat chickens and turkey\n* Pigs - ability raise 2 meat pigs\n* Sheep - ability to raise a flock of sheep for wool\n* Cows - probably not but a stretch goal is to have the ability to raise 2 steer or a mom/calf pair\n\nWith that being said we've found a property that meets many of these requirements. This house is 15 minutes from a Target, it's schools are reasonably well regarded compared to other rural school systems. The schools are a short drive from the house. The surrounding properties are well maintained and the rest of the town is also well maintained; the city seems to be creeping in this direction. \n\n**Property Details**\n\n* Year build: 1860\n* Bedrooms: 5\n* Bathrooms: 1\n* Basement: probably a root cellar \n* Square footage: 1,750\n* Acres: 5.2 (0.5 wooded, 3.5 \"yard\", 1 driveway, .2 random cruft)\n* Asking price: $290,000\n\n\n**Pros of Poperty**\n\n* There is a mixture of timber and pasture. About 0.5 acres of timber and 3.5 acres of pasture. The remaining acre is consumed by the 1,500ft driveway. \n* We could realistically use 2 - 2.5 acres of pasture with the remaining going towards outbuildings, tree outcroppings, and a 0.25 acre yard around the home.\n* The 0.5 acres of forest can be used for pigs. There is another 2 acres of forest behind the property that is owned by the surrounding farmer. I can see a possibility of renting the land, but unlikely to purchase given county ordinances.\n* The outbuildings are 2 years old\n* Somehow this property sits in the middle of a corn field, which means it has a large setback and is further away from neighbors. The house is barely visible from the road\n* A house exists on the property which means, at the very least, there are utilities on the property\n\n**Cons of Property**\n\n* The house was built in 1860 and the upstairs seems to have low ceilings\n* It's not in the *exact right location*. The schools are good, the town is good, it's close to where we want to be, but it's not in the two 1,500 person towns we would love to be in. \n * After speaking to the realtor, it could be *years* for a property that meets our requirements to pop up, since many are bought off-market by surrounding farmers or passed down through family. \n * I've done historical searches of sold homes and each year 1-2 properties are sold in the area we're looking at (not just the two towns) that meet our requirements. Had this property been sold a year ago, I would have considered it to be one of the few that met our requirements. \n\n**What I'm Asking...**\n\n I guess what I'm really asking is just a gut check. We're going to go look at the property and my wife and I are trying to remain as level headed as possible. We don't want to overpay and we don't want to fall in love too soon.  We will probably write an offer for what we believe it's worth even if it's a \"low ball.\" Our realtor is a home builder and my wife's father is an residential architect, both of them will be present at the showing to help us evaluate the structure of the home and the feasibility of renovating. If our offer is accepted we will do a thorough inspection of the structure, the well, and septic. \n\n* Given my homesteading goals, is this property suitable?\n* Does anyone live in a house like this with their family? If you do, do you like it? If not, would you?\n* Those with children in small towns - how are your children? Are they happy? \n* What other items should I inspect? \n* What should I look out for when walking the property?\n* Any other advice?",

I'm literally in the middle of farm country with some of the most productive and expensive farm land in the country. Properties generally fall into one of three categories: \n\n1. A farmer is has parceled off some land and is selling it. This is essentially farmland -- crop acres -- and has no plants other than corn or soybeans. \n2. Heavily treed. The topography of the land is usually quite intense; the land is cut heavily with ravines. If this land were flat, the trees would be clear-cut to create crop acres. \n3. Somewhere in the middle. These are old farm houses, most are under 5 acres, there are few trees other than wind breaks and some nice shade trees around the property. \n\nThe land is limited. I don't intend to have large gardens, my focus would be raising meat to supplement my family's diet. I believe there is enough room to run chickens and turkey and I believe there is enough land to hav a small herd of sheep (5-ish). I believe there is enough woods to rotate 2 pigs. I think having a milking cow is a stretch but is honestly probably not something we would get into anyways. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

Those are two animals I don't raise, so I don't have any special expertise.  BUT, when you say you intend to raise 2 pigs on 1/2 acre of forested land, that *feels* like what you're really going to do is provide 80%+ of the food, and the half acre is really just living space.  Similarly, running ~5 sheep on ~2 acres (after allowing for poultry, etc.) seems unlikely to be a workable yearly load without a ton of supplemental feeding.\n   \nNow, the short answer to all of this may be that you were always intending to do all that feeding anyway, none of this is news, you know all of this and I'm not being helpful.  And, if so, that's great, you have a plan, execute the plan.  But make sure you've really dug into how much your feed costs are going to be, because my impression is that you're going to be providing the majority of the calories for these animals.",

You should budget a good chunk for some updating. \n\nWe removed damaged plaster wearing respirators. Most of the walls had been taken down already so we didn't have much. \n\nUsually the construction is pretty solid on old victorians. Especially if you see the floors are pretty straight. Soft spots can be repaired. \n\nExpect to learn how to do a lot of home repair.\n\nBecause you have little kids you do need to be concerned about lead.

            "comment": "Others already talked about the construction, questions I would have\n\n\\- why on earth is somebody selling 2 years after they build the outbuildings? Whats the reason behind?\n\n\\- How is the elektricity / watersupply?  (See well later)\n\n\\- septic tank, what are the requirements for it and what type is it. Do you need to install a new one due to new laws? For instance at our place we need to install a new one but its still functions. The municipal just ignores our septic for now, but in 10 years I really need to do it. Cost around 14.000 dollars around here. \n\n\\- whats gonna be farmed on the field and sprayed (Somebody already told). And yup, really research this. I live in a real big city where I have a vegetablegarden but I wouldn't dare to start one there. Check the vegetation in the back of the plot and see if it there is a big variety. To be honest I think its a bit to small for homesteading including cows and sheeps and vegetables, but that differs per country.\n\n\\-The well, test it before you buy. With that many farmland around, I guess the levels are too high for drinking water. Besides that,  what is the condition of the pipeline from the well to the house. Often you see that is has many corrosion because of little use or not properly shut off so you have to replace it. (we're gonna do it next year, costs around 5000 dollars).\n\n\\- I would be worried too about the length of the driveway &gt; how are the winters there? I really have no idea how its there. But if it gets a lot of snow, be prepared that you have to invest in a neighbour who will maintain it for you or a snowplough etc. And those are expensive, also the maintenance of the road. \n\nIs there an internetconnection or is possible to connect to the internet because you both work from home. \n\nAnd please visit the \" closest neighbors\" around, because believe me, without a good neighbors it sucks to homestead. This differs from \" I got stuck with my car and need help of the neighbours till seriously accidents or just a nice chat around,.\n\nHow many kids are around in that area.?  Can they go over easily to play or do you need to bring them. \n\nWe have a holidayhome in the countryside in another country (we have family there) and are intending to move too. It looks more or less the same although it was a lot cheaper. Its a fucking moneypit because you're intending to upgrade with endgoal moving. The winters are harsh here, so maybe thats different too. Try to upgrade the house as fast as comfortable as possible, with kids it just sucks if the waterpipeline dies or a tree falls on the electricity (yeah thats another story).Kids love it her, and my kids of family totally love it, playing in the woods etc. Invest in a proper swing and stuff like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck with your decision.",

The age of the house by itself wouldn\u2019t deter me.\nThat said\u2026I see a couple of red flags:\n\n\u2014The drop ceilings &amp; ceiling in weight room would concern me. (The bedroom drop ceiling looks especially out of place - why did they add it?) If you proceed, I\u2019d pay for a stellar inspection of the attic, roof, ceilings &amp; walls. Old water damage and/or termites can add huge costs to renovations and be a potential health hazard.\n\n\u2014Inspect also a must on pipes (lead?) and potential DIY electrical work mentioned before. Getting even just an electrical panel up to code can be $$$.\n\n\u2014A few other people mentioned the surrounding fields. This would have been a deal-breaker for us when we had young kids, since children are especially susceptible to pesticides, asthma triggers, etc. If the fields were *yours,* that would be one thing \u2014 but because they won\u2019t be, you have no control over your very immediate environment. \nIf you go for it, I\u2019d second the opinions on water, soil, and other enviro testing before closing the deal. \n\n\u2014I\u2019d also ask yourself how comfortable you\u2019d be if that surrounding land was sold to housing developers in the near future. The soil doesn\u2019t look great, and your distance-to-Target ratio suggests that development might be in your future.\n\nGood luck, either way!",

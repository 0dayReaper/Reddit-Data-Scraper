    "postText": "Pardon the weird title, but I'm really at a loss here. I'm housesitting for a homesteading family, and just had to put their smallish dog in a cone because she was licking a wound. The family has seven sheep, and they've been acting really weird about the dog ever since she was put in the cone. Usually they ignore her until she gets too close and then walk away, but now they stare at her and, if I'm not next to her, walk towards her. She runs if they approach her now, which I've never seen her do before. They've never managed to reach her before I intervene or she runs away, so I don't know what their intentions are, but I've never seen them this bold before. I tried googling it but haven't found anything. Do you think this is just harmless curiosity, or do I need to make sure I'm always besides her in the sheep field?",

            "comment": "I'm guessing they sense injury or lack of strength. The ram or alpha ewe will butt the dog. Periodically they'll turn to challenge a trained sheepdog, too. It's good pro-social herd behavior. Dogs usually manage it well, either by asserting their authority or by dodging away. With a cone of shame, the dog could get caught unawares.",

    "postText": "I have 6 goslings. I need your best inexpensive fencing ideas! I have 5 acres and want to move them around for fresh foraging. I have a chicken tractor but prefer not to build one for geese because it's a big expense and a lot of effort.\n\nOur #1 predator is foxes and not much else except a neighborhood dog. We have aerial predators, too, but my goslings are quickly becoming too big to be tempting for them. We've been here a year and haven't lost a cat or a chicken to a fox but I see it almost daily so I know it's a looming threat. \n\nBut, by the time they're full grown geese, they will be badass enough to stand up to a fox, right? Especially all 6 of them. \n\nWhat about a 7' tall mesh deer fence attached to t-posts? Too lightweight? \n\nI like the idea of welded wire but it is very expensive for taller options (needs to be tall because foxes excellent jumpers). I'm not sure I can run an electric fence because, as understand it, you need to weedwack around the fence every time you move it and that's just too high maintenance for me. \n\nSo...any suggestions on how to contain 6 geese and deter a fox? Thanks!",

Make sure you train the geese to the fence or they can freak out and get themselves tangled up in it.  And really, you can just mow the section you are going to move them to.  It takes me 20 minutes to move 200 feet of fencing.",

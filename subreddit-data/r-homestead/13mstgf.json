Oregon, approx 4400'/1340m elevation) and my little cold frame/hulgeculture bed is pumping out tons of greens for me still!!\n\nIf you are interested, here is a video of the cold feame higleculture build: https://youtu.be/kh3R3YmTMkg\n\nI am entirely off grid on my little 5 acre homeatead and all my water is rainwater collection. While I did manage to store a lot of water this past winter, I still make every effort to conserve and reuse water if possible.\n\nChallenging conditions but I have been enjoying fresh spinach, mache, kale, claytonia, radishs, mizuna, and herbs in this cold frame since this last winter and have my warm season corn, potatoes, beans, peas, quinoa, sunflowers, sunchokes planted and growing well!!\n\nI think during the height of summer after all my greens have bolted, I may turn them into the soil and prepare for planting greens in the fall to last through winter.. Or at least as long as I can through winter, we have some brutal winters up here!!\n\nAnyone have reccommendations for drought/cold tolerant edible plants?",

Has a good rep though. \n\nI\u2019m at about 5,000ft in the Mojave, currently munching on my breakfast of kale, New Zealand spinach, and amaranth. Oh yeah, amaranth is a great hardy plant with tasty greens. If I had to depend on one singe plant in this climate it would be purslane though. It actually just showed up on its own and now I broadcast seed the stuff everywhere. It\u2019s succulent, grows most of the season, is chock full of nutrients, and is delicious saut\u00e9ed in olive oil with some salt. Oh I just planted some day lilies which are edible too. We shall see about that.\n\nYou\u2019re a savage up there harvesting water man! This is the way. If you aren\u2019t already familiar, look up Brad Lancaster from Tucson. He\u2019s the author of the series \u201cRainwater Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond\u201d. His books are fat and in depth with so much detail about so many techniques it\u2019s amazing. Dude\u2019s my hero. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m gonna keep an eye on this thread as I\u2019m interested in finding new hardy edibles as well. Keep up the good work! \ud83e\udd19",

But I will give it a try, I think it readily propagates from cuttings and I believe I know areas where it does grow!\n\nAh, one I forgot to mention is tepary beans, native SW beans from your area. I am growing a couple high-altitude desert strains. This is my first year growing them so \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e..\n\nAmaranth is amazing.. I grew some last year and before the rodents raided all my beds, really enjoyed the greens. I am growing a strain I got from Native Seed Research from New Mexico along with grocery store quinoa.\n\nDigging a well in my area is a matter of tens of thousands of dollars.. and I have been barefoot for the past 4 weeks because the soles peeled off my Danners.. Not in the budget for me lol.. I don't wear a lot of clothes at my homestead this time of year anyway..\n\nBut I am able to build swales and huglebeds. I put up several hundred gallons of water this winter (lots of snow this winter, how the great majority of our moisture falls). I also try to orientate my garden beds to catch the morning sun but somewhat shaded during the height of the afternoon.",

If one is judicious about their water use and comes at it with a conservation mindset, it is 100% doable.\nInitially, I wanted land out on the S. Oregon Coast but I am very happy where I am.\n\nI would suggest not buying property in the Klamath Falls Forest Estates.. I have several friends off grid out there and it is constant neighbor drama, police and county code enforcement, etc. Lots of tweakers and generally undesirable neighbors. I found this parcel about 2 miles from my closest neighbor (and she is 3 miles from her next closest neighbor) and it is fantastic!!\nRight up next to the Fremont-Winema National Forest where I can hunt, fish, forage, harvest firewood..\n\nHope you make that dream a reality soon!",

    "postText": "Just like the title - do you ever get overwhelmed by the potential of what you could be doing on your land and don't know what project to tackle next? \n\nWe have around 20 acres and have been here almost 2 years now. We've cleared about 8 acres with forestry mulching, built a 30x40 pole barn garage, have started a garden, got chickens and geese and turkeys, planted a 60+ fruit tree orchard, have started rehabilitating the soil with Korean Natural Farming techniques, and are (hopefully!) breaking ground on a house in the next couple of months. But it doesn't feel like enough! We have plans to expand the garden, fence in more than just the few acres we did last year, and get some sheet and pigs (thanks to having local friends who are teaching us the best way to raise them). I'm so excited for all the things we *could* do and are doing, but it feels like the to-do list is only getting longer! There's so much I want to try my hand at!",

It'll be this nearly eternal, living, growing thing that will constantly be on it's way to fulfilling a dream or vision.  If used wisely, there will be room to expand for generations, however people want to make use of it.  It can be used for any number of things.\n\nAnd it certainly beats some postage stamp lot 30ft from the neighbors in an HOA where I can't even pick what color the shutters are.\n\nIf I have to have too many choices or not enough, I'll take too many...and probably still pick something that wasn't on the list.  lol",

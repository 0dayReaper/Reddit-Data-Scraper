I have a solar powered pump kit and I just need to plumb it from the nearby pond to the cabin. I will bury the line 3 ft down. I need a diagram or something for the parts needed to do it right and prevent freezing. I already have the tank full sensor and panels setup for the pump.",

            "comment": "Read the manual for the pump. Does the pump need to be out of the water, or does it go in the water? What kind of protection does it need from sediment and debris on its intake? \n\nWhat kind of plumbing are you planning to bury -- PVC? Pex? Irrigation tubing? \n\nAre you burying a straight line of pipe, or are there corners/angles? \n\nWhat's your frost line? Depending on where in the world you're living, burying the pipe 3' down might not be deep enough, or it might be total overkill and a waste of effort. \n\nWhat's the overflow situation look like if the pump is running when the uphill tank is already full? How will that overflow handle freezing? \n\nThese questions, and more, will need to be answered before anyone can figure out what plumbing parts you need to buy.",

I already  have a pump net to protect it from debris. \n\nI\u2019d prefer to use flexible tubing or pex as I already have a pex tool. \n\nPipe run could be curved or straight. It will likely have to change angles twice. \n\nLocals say 3ft deep is sufficient for main lines from a well pump. \n\nThe kit comes with a tank full sensor to prevent overflowing. It will be plumbed to a 50 gal tank inside the cabin. I can put a emergency overflow on the storage tank. \n\nI\u2019ve plumbed the entire cabin and have replaced a well pump in the past so I have a general idea of what needs to be done. I\u2019m just not sure on the specifics to keep it from freezing in the winter especially because it\u2019s coming from a pond instead of a well.",

Buried wires, especially with splices, have a nasty habit of failing after awhile. That's not to say don't do it, but be aware that that part of the system may require quite a bit of troubleshooting.",

The kit comes with pretty long wires for the pump and sensor since it\u2019s designed for a 400ft deep well. The panels and batteries are already powering the whole cabin.",

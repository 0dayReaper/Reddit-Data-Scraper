            "comment": "Ohh this brings me back a few years. Late one summer night I decided to sleep in the trailer in our backyard, my little get away of sorts. I was awoken to this loud commotion from my chicken coop. Without hesitating I jumped up and ran fullspeed completely naked with only moon light to lead the way. I burst into my chicken coop but it was so dark I couldn't make sense of what was happening. After a few moments my eyes adjusted and I saw a outline of what appeared to be one of my barn cats on the perch, about head height. Not thinking any different I grabbed my \"cat\" and quickly realized it was a rather unhappy raccoon. Instincts kicked in and i dropped him real quick. About 10 seconds later he was escaping from the tiniest hole he must of made in one of the corners near the roof. I was astonished to see this big animal manipulate its body through what I deemed an impossible exit.\n\nIt was all over. Silence resumed....and then I realized I was naked in my chicken coop at 3 am.\n\n",

Coyote hits the woods and hubbie comes up, grabs the rifle from me and takes off after it. \n\nI should mention that he's completely naked, as in just stepped out of the shower.\n\nI'm glad the neighbors aren't close...\n\nIf Ashley hadn't started growling, we would never have known there was trouble.

I heard the commotion, ran for the door, and grabbed a 2x2 on the way. I banged out the back door practically on top of him. He froze for a second like he'd just crapped a brick and looked at me in total shock, the chicken took advantage of it, got herself free and ran for it.\n\nI took a swing at him with the stick but he had recovered himself and dodged in time. He ran like crazy and this time he didn't stop until he was out of sight. Never saw him again after that.",

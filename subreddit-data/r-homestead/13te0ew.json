            "comment": "My theory is that the ovary was damaged by frost and this injury is the result.  I suspect  if you were to cut into the peach, you would find damage all the way to the pit and possibly a split pit.  \n\nThe other possibility is stink bugs early in the season.  This is known as catfacing   \n [https://netreefruit.org/stone-fruit/peaches/insects/tarnished-plant-bug-tpb](https://netreefruit.org/stone-fruit/peaches/insects/tarnished-plant-bug-tpb)\n\nThe insect that bores into peaches is called peach curculio. It would generally attack by this stage but doesn't cause this amount of damage.",

Little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) and the Pennsylvania sedge (Carex Pennsylvanica) would be native here. Steep slopes love surfing water and gravity (aka erosion). Can also help to incorporate armoring (Big F. Rocks) to help with drainage and mitigate erosion. Looks great. Will be doing the same project soon so thanks very much for posting.",

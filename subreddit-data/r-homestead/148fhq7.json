    "postText": "We recently bought a house that was built in the 1930\u2019s and upon wondering what some loose decking was all about, we found this well looking thing. We are confused as to what the purpose is. The basement has a sump-pump that works. Could this have been the original? If it was built in the 30\u2019s, we don\u2019t think that outlet would be in there. All of the gutters to the house run underground and there is a drain in the barn that water from the gutters run through then drains into the creek behind the house. My husband put the hose in this \u2018well\u2019 and filled it up to see what would happen. We could hear the water running through the barns drain. We also plugged it in and nothing happens.

So it could be effectively giving the water an easier path than into your basement. You can get biodegradable dye tablets or liquid on Amazon to pour into it and then turn the pump on to maybe help find where the water discharges.\n\nEdit to add: the pump might be dead if it\u2019s sat a while or you could have a tripped breaker because none of that looks like it is properly set up electrically for such a high moisture environment so the plug itself may have corroded and shorted out the pump.",

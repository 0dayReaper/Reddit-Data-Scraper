            "comment": "Raspberries are expensive because they are tricky to harvest and don\u2019t transport super well. This severely limits the varieties and flavors you can get at a store. You can get much better raspberries growing them yourself and save more money. Grapes on the other hand you won\u2019t see nearly the difference between store bought. \n\nGrapes tend to be hardier and easier to grow, at least in my area. One or two sprays a year and I\u2019m good to go. They grow nicely on trellises and are easy to harvest. I can also easily bag them so I don\u2019t have to worry about wasps or many insects. Raspberries have thorns, get picked at by birds, and can\u2019t easily be covered.",

It has a patio.  \n\n\nWe currently have two 5-gallon containers of raspberries, and two black berry bushes in a 15 gallon container, AND we will be getting in a couple of riverbank grape vines in their own 5 gallon containers out there.  \nThe berries are for the berries, I really don't need the grapes for the fruit, though it'd be a cool extra, I suppose.  \nI *can* make tisane (some would just call this 'tea') from their leaves - really good for lady times, those raspberry leaves.    \nI can wrap up rice and protein combinations in any of the three's leaves, too - grape leaves are de. lish. us.  \n\nIf some lost girl up in Canada with a rented patio has all three, why not you, yourself?  You deserve to mix things up with your taste buds. \\^\\^",

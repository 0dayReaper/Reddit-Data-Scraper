    "postText": "Started with sting bushy tomato plants, then one started to wilt, figured I needed to water more. Then the one beside it started to wilt. One by one in a row they wilt and start to die. I water at night and have fertilized with 10 10 10. No signs of fungus or animal disturbance. I have 4 happy healthy plants left I\u2019m going to pull up the dieing ones today, but I want to save my healthy ones. What have I done wrong. I\u2019ve planted in the same spot and they usually flourish.",

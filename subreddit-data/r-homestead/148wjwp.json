    "postText": "Hi y\u2019all, I am unable to dig a well (long story) so am considering burying a cistern for rain catchment. However, all of these plastic tanks have a max fill coverage depth of 28-36\u201d.  Anything more voids the warranty. I\u2019m in zone 4 with a 4\u2019-5\u2019 frost line. Do you think insulating the tank will be adequate at such shallow depths? Anyone have experience with this? Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Rigid foam, look up frost protected shallow foundations to get an idea on how and why it works. Just make sure to dig it wide enough so the wings can do their thing. In the winter, piling up snow on things weirdly enough helps insulate from the extreme cold. Drain fields, pipe runs etc.",

We used this technique (rigid foam) for a large underground water storage tank in an area with 4' to 5' frost depths.  The tank was for water to be used in a fire sprinkler system (non-profit building with public uses) and the frost protection method was acceptable to all inspectors including state Fire Marshall, local authorities and insurance inspectors.",

Another one is \"Ambition Strikes\", they're in the same area as the others and are now using a cistern since they've gotten tired of hauling water totes up the mountain.",

I did some more research and found this article that says every inch of rigid foam board insulation \u201cis equivalent to 3.7\u2019 of soil in insulating value, so it doesn\u2019t take much extra foam to protect the tank from freezing.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/34699439/Installing-Domestic-Water-Storage-Tanks-in-freezing-climates-Alaska",

Yeah people do it, but above ground tanks grow algae and nasties much faster, not to mention phthalates etc...\n\nConcrete tanks are meant to be buried, though the parting line for the lid should be above grade in some places to meet code.",

When we lived in town, my kids could care less about the birds around our house.  Now they are pointing out the different types of birds and trying to find  out what type they are.",

Along with raccoons, snakes, possum, coyotes, neighborhood dogs and cats, they help to keep things in check and in balance.  Appreciating nature is a big part of homesteading!",

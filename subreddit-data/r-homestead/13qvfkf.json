    "postText": "I am trying to clean up and maintain 3 acres of wooded trails.  Trying to haul and safely burn while having a full time job just isn\u2019t feasible at this scale.  \n\nI am looking for a mobile chipper, that can handle dead pine and spruce branches, weeds, thin junk trees, and leaves.  Much of this will be green, and from what I\u2019m reading it\u2019s a crapshoot whether chippers can handle green material or not.\n\nCan anyone recommend a product/brand that won\u2019t completely break the bank?  \n\nThanks in advance for the help!",

It's not worth it to buy one, at least for me.\n\nOtherwise you're looking at $5k plus for a \"good\" one that can handle up to 4-5\" logs. The under-$2k ones that claim to handle 3\" logs sometimes don't handle 3\" logs and it's very frustrating.\n\nI also have a small one from Harbor Freight that does up to 2.5\", it sucked at first but I took the blades/hammers/whatever out and sharpened them on a bench grinder and it works much better now. I use it for mulching up saplings.",

Best to just rent a beast after you have it all piled up and not have to worry about breaking the bank or the equipment. After the initial cleanup is done maintenance will not require a massive chipper.",

It why I wanted to explore a mobile chipper I could use as I clear.  But with a limited budget and no tractor/PTO it\u2019s not feasible.  Renting twice a year is definitely the way to go.\n\nThanks to you and everyone in the channel.  Everyone is so helpful, friendly and nice.",

It will handle anything you throw at it including small trees.  If you are looking for that kind I can expand but it's all I have experience with.  I love it.",

We are big enough where it would be very useful but not so big that it\u2019s a requirement making cost justification difficult given how many other projects we have going on.  \n\nI am thinking that until we invest in a tractor the piling and renting will be our best bet.\n\nI really appreciate the guidance, thank you!",

They actually seem to grind better than dead/decayed wood. You might have an issue with your weeds or vines binding up the feeder wheel.",

            "comment": "I can give you my limited experience only. I have a Wallenstein 5\" chipper that I run on my Tractor's PTO. It is a premium machine and was about $3700. The tractor is only 33 hp which is enough power to sheer the pin on the drive shaft.\n\nIt will barely handle 5\" straight soft wood like pine, sassafras and aspen. 3-4\"is fine. 3\" is max on real hardwood. Not a bid deal as I burn the larger stuff anyway.\n\nAnything too branched requires cutting. Feeding a lot of twiggy stuff is work and you don't get a lot of mulch for the effort. Green twigs and pine needles also plug the shoot.\n\nIt works perfectly for what I am doing which is clearing 2-4\" sasafrass and aspen to make chips for my garden on an ongoing basis. If you are cleaning up a lot of straight hardwood growth in the woods it works really well.  I would not get anything smaller. You would be better off burning it.\n\nIf you have a lot of stuff you want to chip all at once rent a commercial unit. The big ones will suck in an 8\" tree or limb and grind it in seconds.",

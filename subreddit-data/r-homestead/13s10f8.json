Hoping for some good harvests in the coming years. \n\nStill early so I don't have too many tips, but grow what works well in your climate. Black raspberries and black currants grow like literal weeds on my property, so I'm going to embrace that and collect as many as I can. Just cleaning up the brush around my yard last year I found about 14 raspberry plants, so I dug them all up and stuck them into one spot",

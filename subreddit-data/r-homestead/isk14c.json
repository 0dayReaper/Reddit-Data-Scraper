            "comment": "That\u2019s great! One suggestion. I\u2019ve been cutting, junking, splitting and stacking wood since I was old enough to be at it and in my opinion and experience one long line like that is more prone to a domino styled topple. Shifting ground under the weight, a big windstorm, anything to make it founder could topple the whole thing. I\u2019d have split that up into about 3 rows about half a foot apart just so that if some of it starts to fall for any reasons it\u2019ll just list over into another row and hopefully stay where you put it. Also if it\u2019s three rows or four rows you can tarp over it easier than a 120 foot row of wood. That\u2019ll keep it dry so you\u2019re not putting soggy wood in the stove. Fantastic job all the same though! That\u2019s a lot of work!",

It's pretty stable though, I can give it a pretty good push anywhere along it and it barely moves.  We'll see what the wind says though. \n\nAny opinion on this method vs the Norwegian round stacking method?",

If you're limited on space, you can stack a significant amount of wood with the Norwegian method in a smaller space.",

People still burn wood very often here so everyone and their dog has a cord of wood stacked up on the property. A \u201ccord\u201d of wood is a stacked pile with the dimensions of 4 feet high by 4 feet wide by 8 feet long. That\u2019s usually two or three 8 foot long rows stood up next to each other so you can eyeball how much wood people have for burning or for sale or whatever. I haven\u2019t done the pros and cons for many different methods other than just seeing the entire population around me sorta accept one way as standard practice so I did too. That and the experience of having a few tier topple over before haha. Any way that works for you is the best way on your property! Congrats on it all by the way, live the dream :)",

Get the posts up and the roof on, put a couple inches of 3/4\" stone, and you're set. If you want a concrete pad you can just pour it later, and you can nails boards straight to the posts for siding.

You want your smoke out of your smoker to be almost blue. The type of wood you are using is very important as well. Steer clear of conifers (pine, cedar, cypress, spruce, etc.) as the tar in these woods will make your food taste \"off\" and high levels will make you sick. Oak, hickory, mesquite, and fruit woods are a good fall back and each lend their own unique flavor. My apologies if you are aware of this already, you just got me started on something I am passionate about.\n\nTo keep your firewood from rotting, elevate it off the ground. I usually run a couple limbs (from the tree I felled) perpendicular to the direction my stack will be and use it as a base to stack on. You could do the same thing with a pair of 4x4. I live in a humid environment and have never tarped or covered my firewood, but this puts me in the 12 month range for seasoned firewood. I have a 12' long rack in my covered smoker area where I keep the wood I will be using for the year. Every spring I rotate in firewood from my oldest stack. \n\nTLDR : you can use rotted wood but it will affect the flavor and have an unreliable burn rate and do so quite inefficiently. This will make it difficult to keep a consistent temperature and smoke level. Save that stuff for the firepit and use the dry stuff for smoking.",

I've tried and it produces a smoke so bitter it will numb your lip. I use a 55 gallon drum I've cut a few dampers into. It works but it takes a large amount of wood to have a decent yield. I haven't figured out how to store it away from humidity, I'm currently trying out a rubbermaid tote. I mostly use wood in my smokers and wood chips for my sausage smoker. The only real use I have for charcoal is my gaucho grill &amp; it takes probably 6 lbs of charcoal everytime I fire it up.",

Smaller saws will wear out prematurely.  \n  \nSaws aren't designed to run balls to the wall for long periods of time, and they cool off during idle. Also, don't run a 50:1 fuel for milling - more like a 35:1.",

I know absolutely zero about cutting lumber so I'm only going off the video but this might be a cheap short term solution.  Amazon link to the guide is in the video comments.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz3g7NB8bC8",

But the other issue discovered later was while the house didn\u2019t get too warm the parts of the house further from the stove stayed more humid so there was issue with mold in the back of the house. \n\nThis year even if I means just having to start more fires I\u2019m going for hotter fires and letting them burn down if it must. Hopefully this will keep the chimney cleaner and the moisture out of the air.",

Many of those have been re-planted as industrial agriculture moved into the most productive areas, and construction lumber has largely begun coming from \"planted\" wood rather than natural forest.  Most lumber comes from vast stands of southern yellow pine and douglas fir that mature in 15 years or so. \n\nThe good thing is that although a true \"old growth\" hardwood forest takes 100 years or more,  a forest can be largely mature in 20 years with proper management, then good selective cutting practices can keep it that way.\n\nAnd, given enough land you could probably permanantly maintain firewood for a family without too much trouble, but you'd need maybe 20 acres of forest to not have much of an impact.",

For a larger cabin or a family, you might need 2-3 trees worth of wood. \n\nIn rural areas you can get cut trees delivered pretty cheaply too. A local tree service is usually happy to drop off a few trunks at your place if they're doing a job in the area. And national forests typically allow people to come in and cut deadfalls for firewood during a certain time of year with a $15 permit. \n\nSo if you live in a heavily wooded area, you won't have a problem finding wood.

We\u2019d bring it home, cut them down and then split it. Then my sister would help us stack it up. \n\nIt\u2019s also the reason I laugh if a guy asks if I need help carrying a fifty pound bag of potatoes or onions in the kitchen I work.",

Anyway, I worked. 10 hours a day splitting and stacking and chainsawing so much wood.  \n\nAsh burns nice and hot after seasoning.  Great job on all the work.  I noticed a few were critical of the single, long linear stacking....whatever.  If it falls, the wood burns the same and there is always next year.  Hard work indeed",

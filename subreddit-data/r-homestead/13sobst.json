    "postText": "Hi guys, it\u2019s our first time hatching incubated eggs and I\u2019m hoping you can help me. We\u2019ve had one chick hatch so far, bang on the 21 days to the hour. It\u2019s been 6 hours now and none of the other 5 eggs are showing signs of hatching. I know we aren\u2019t meant to remove this chick till the others hatch, but realistically how long do we leave it for? Google reckons 24 hours, but what if we leave it 24 hours and the others start hatching then? Do we leave this early bird in or take them out to the brooder?",

It takes them about 12 hours to get the coordination to be able to walk to the food/water, so no reason to rush moving them.\n\nKeep in mind that not all your eggs will hatch - commercial hatching rates, with guaranteed fertility and industrial equipment, are still only 19 out of 20, and for home hatching anything above 80% is pretty solid (below 50% is where you start re-evaluating your approach).",

Seeing where in the development process they kicked it can point to issues during the last 3 days (where they shouldn't be turned and need higher humidity), earlier in the incubation, or right on hatch day.\n\nMy first time hatching, I had 25% that would have been fine except for a hatching day mishap - the first chicks out pushed some of the other eggs against the bare plastic case of the incubator, and those chicks got chilled and failed to hatch (but cracking the eggs open showed they had been just about ready to, having fully absorbed the yolk). Next time around, I put in a paper towel bumper to keep that from happening, and had a much higher hatch rate.",

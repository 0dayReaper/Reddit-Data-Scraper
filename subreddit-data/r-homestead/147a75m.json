(livable, had to get that last d in there, bonus round!)\n\nOk now I am just rambling so it is fine if this part gets ignored, read some comments about a cellar/crawlspace and have been set for long to build my own bunker where a decent amount of time could be spent, you know, just in case -insert preferred end of the world event, natural disaster or whichever cause here-.\n1. Any tips (design, links, all tips and ideas welcome)\n2. Aprox time for 1 man work (gotta fit 3 people for reference)?\n\nSorry, maybe I should have just commented, Esther way.\nHave a great day!",

I see them once in a blue moon, but they pretty much avoid my land. \n\nAlso down here, the issue is being able to put a fence up in the first place, you got 1\u201d down and you\u2019ve hit rock, a 3-4ft barb wire fence can take weeks to put in simply due to the struggles of getting the posts into the ground. Even with a motorized post driver, the rocks stop that and you have to pull it back out and set around that hole, or dig down and remove the rock and try again, also hoping you don\u2019t fuck up the T post much either, we\u2019ve had them completely bend from the driver. \n\nMost of the deer are also kinda smaller since they only get to forage rather than eat in fields of food, 6ft is plenty for the vast majority of people here, my step mom put up a 5\u2019 fence so she could still look into her back yard when her grandkids come and the deer stopped going into her yard with that. \n\nHowever in northern missouri on our family farms up there we put up 6.5-7ft fencing because the deer up there are on buffet fields of food, and can be around 60-100lb heavier than the southern deer. \n\nWe\u2019ve collectively got ~120 acres in southern Missouri and ~280 in northern Missouri \n\nIt genuinely is all local and circumstantial.",

A couple pertain to pruning and more or less why you should never do it.  \n\nAlso look into grafting.  There was some artist, where over a few decades, make a great big fruit tree with like 52 different fruits on it because they were all in the the same family or genus or whatnot.  Most fruiting trees require a ceparste cultivar for cross polenation.  So there's a way that you can do it with grading here and there throughout the orchard so you jest have to put a hive near it and the bees will cross pollinate pretty well.",

            "comment": "Depends on how much you want to put out, but with the prices of trees getting out of hand (and the quality I've seen coming out of many nurseries lately has been spotty, largely due to trying to cut out professional nurserymen for $$$), you might consider learning how to graft. You can buy scions from a place like Fruitwood Nursery or Cummins Nursery for around $4 (each of which can do a couple trees if you bud graft), and rootstocks for $3.50 each (or buy 3 grams of apple seed, which is around 90 seeds for $10, same basically goes for all fruit types). If you use interstem grafts, you'll only add a year before fruiting by using a seedling rootstock, but it's a lot cheaper.\n\nI planted mine on 7'x7' spacing, with Bittenfelder or Antonovka rootstocks and B9 interstems (Bottom wire is at 12\", middle wire is at 4 ft, and top wire is at 7ft (most of the trees aren't quite to the top wire yet). Trained to a bi cordon UFO system (look up Dr. Stuart Tustin in NZ and the \"guyot-tree\" system in Europe). Trees will be kept at around 8' tall. Nice thing with this system is that it's highly productive, largely pedestrian, your spray equipment doesn't need to be large, and you can summer prune with a sicklebar mower.\n\nPeaches, almonds, and apricots are on Lovell, Sweet Cherry are on Mazzard, sour cherry are on seedling, Plum are on Myrobalan (Prunus Cerasifera), Mulberry are on seedling, and Pears are on OHxF333. All planted on 7x7 and trained roughly the same way as the apples (peaches are a little different, due to fruiting habit). Notice most of these are seedling rootstock, and I've established a few stooling beds for the ones not on seedling stocks (pay attention to patents though, don't get caught reproducing protected varieties).\n\nI also have about .5 acres in the back I'm planting to nuts (where the almonds are now), and I've been going around and digging up seedling black walnuts and moving them there, planted on 20x20, I'll be grafting about 2/3 of them over to white walnut off a precocious tree (produced nuts only after 4 or 5 years) at my grandparent's place. Chestnuts and European Hazel will also be planted there on 20x20. It'll take the nut trees  around 15 years to achieve canopy closure, so I'll be planting raspberries and blackberries there in the \"aisles\" until then.\n\nI grow veg to help pay the bills till the orchards are really pumping, but Orcharding and small fruit are my passions. Best time to plant an orchard was 20 years ago, second best time is today! I second the comment that mentioned \"The Holistic Orchard\", the book really helped me to start thinking of ways to not use the chemicals.",

This helps preserve water too because the plants help feed each other when guilded properly. Obviously find what\u2019s right for your area, I have several friends that have started planting like this and even my little city that I\u2019m urban steading in now has a community food forest (I also help with that). I use a lot of strawberries and clover together too, they help feed one another.",

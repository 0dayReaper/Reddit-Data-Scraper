I'm deep in South TX so it's definitely blocked off from people and reality lol but much cheaper.\n\nThere are little towns just south of San Antonio that are breaking the big ranches up into ranchettes that are not as crazily priced as the hill country and still close enough to go to SA for shopping and stuff like that.\n\nIt definitely can be tough to balance out community and friends and being remote in Texas though.  \n\nEast &amp; North East TX gets a lot more rain than central and South TX though so might be more economic for that area for that reason alone.  If we didn't have this huge aquifer down here we'd be struggling with water.",

It\u2019s saved many goat and sheep babies\u2019 lives in and out of the clinic. \n\nPlus, not many kids are taught how this stuff works. Those that learn this will save the world someday.",

They don\u2019t understand which ones lay eggs or how eggs can\u2019t be fertilized without a rooster. This is basic knowledge, or so I thought. \n\nIn many schools and homes, there\u2019s one trip to a petting zoo as a kid, and that is the extent of their experience with animals. If no one knows how to care for livestock, which is essential to the production of food, we are doomed. It is approaching a time when everyone will have to produce their own food, especially with the climate crisis being exacerbated by the meat industry. Many people, who weren\u2019t raised this way, are switching to personally sustainable ways of life, which is inspiring. I can\u2019t tell you how many people I meet/ hear of/ see online in a week, who are moving to the country to begin a farm. It\u2019s a joke around here that \u201cthey\u2019re from California,\u201d when someone calls and asks farmers or vets questions that are common knowledge to us. We try to encourage, of course, but it\u2019s appalling how little people know about animals, farming, and gardening. \n\nThese things may mean nothing to you or maybe you won\u2019t believe that this is even a crisis we are experiencing, but as a person who was born in a county with 95 dairy farms (I\u2019m not even 30 yet.), which now has zero dairy farms, I\u2019m very aware of our farmers. It\u2019s a tragedy that men and women have to give up on generational farming to go to work for someone else.",

These eggs were sold as \u201cfree range.\u201d The chickens were living behind a giant chain link fence on a large concrete pad with what appeared to be zero overheat cover. They had no access to dirt, no plants, no comforts, and they are being sold to people who envision what we all mean when we free range chickens.

You pick for yourself the rules you will go about your life abiding. That is all you can ever truly have absolute agency over. The only objective constant. There is only YOUR reality. Anything that you perceive in the world only has value because you choose to bestow that quality on to it. This is applicable to everyone simultaneously. It's how a person is able to \"make a profit\". They give something away in exchange for an item they value more. A person lives their life in a manner that is in line with what they value. Hence why we aren't a collective hivemind. There are things many people hold in common value, to be sure, but this is more due to the fact that the overwhelming majority of people obey the base compulsions implicit with being human. Even then, that is because people choose to obey them. As such, to claim your reality has precedence over another is, at best, foolish\n\ntl;dr: That's just like, your opinion, man",

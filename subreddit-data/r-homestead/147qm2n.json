    "postText": "Our first batch of meat birds is 53 days old, and 11 days left until we send them to the processor. We've had the usual unfortunate losses, chicks at the beginning plus I think 3 total casualties from moving the chicken tractors.\n\nThere was one bird dead yesterday, initially we thought from moving the tractor but when my husband went to grab it he said it was cold already.\n\nNow I'm getting worried that the birds are getting too big. [Here's a video](https://imgur.com/a/93zDsCU) showing what their walking looks like. They do a fair bit of the few steps then sit down. From those with experience, should they be fine for another 11 days? Or should I phone and see if, by chance, the processor can squeeze us in earlier to prevent possible losses?\n\nEdit: these birds are more my husband's thing than mine - I'm afraid of birds. I help with the non-touching/not in the enclosure parts though. Husband isn't concerned, I just thought I'd ask here for advice to minimize losses, maximize bird comfort, and put my mind at ease (I'm the resident worrier.)",

Outdoor temp is 23\u00b0C/73\u00b0F right now.\n\nThere are ventilation flaps at the bottom, don't recall if they're up or not. Will go check shortly.\n\n(I will say here, and also edit my post to add, that these birds are not my project but my husband's - I assist with a few things, but am hands off and just do stuff like help him move the tractors daily, take care of the books, pick up the birds from the processor etc. I'm afraid of birds, so if I need to be where they can touch me/I have to touch them, I'm screaming like a little girl. But I do try to keep an eye on them from outside the tractors.)",

Here's a [video](https://imgur.com/a/Dt28zxw) of the birds in the other tractor.\n\nThe first tractor has the bottom ~2' of tarp unattached. I'm guessing that should be up on one or both sides for better ventilation? The door end (facing north currently) is all chicken wire, as you see, and the opposite end is solid plywood.\n\nThe second tractor is half wire on frame, half tin on frame. Wire end is currently the south side.",

Your birds are going to be overheating and their bodies stressed once you get above 75. You can fix this by either removing entirely, or taking 1-1.5' strips off the tarp. That should drastically improve your ventilation and temperature control so the birds get better air.\n\nYou have a lot of room in the tractor but you have no roosts. I'd suggest putting in some 2x4s or OSB boards about 18\" off the ground for the birds to roost on. Alternatively or in addition, you can make a sort of \"shelf\" that they can both sit inside of and on top of. That will give them a place to sit together and stay warm and also may reduce the number of birds on the ground when you move the tractor.\n\nNow as for the tractor mishaps, this tractor appears heavy enough to crush a bird and to that end, consider either lowering the wheels so they elevate the tractor about 1-2inches so you can roll it more easily without having to lift it up. If you do that you want the wheels fixed to both sides of the very rear of the tractor. OR convert it into a sled. With either technique you can pull with a chain to compensate for the weight of the tractor and more importantly you can keep the tractor low to the ground and avoid squishing birds. Right now you have to lift that heavy thing up and it's sort of a guillotine.\n\nYour yard does not have great grazing grass so make sure you supplement the birds with crumble. I see you have a feeder already so perhaps find a way to hang it from the tractor or build a ground-level platform to set it on. Keep it about chest high for the birds.\n\nYou need more water in there and lower to the ground. I'd suggest a second waterer, and no more than 3-4 inches off the ground. Your birds are looking dehydrated and water will help a ton. You can also put vitamin and other nutrient additives in the water. There's a lot of options at most local farm stores.\n\nLastly, the lethargy and walking issues could also be a sign of Lymphoid Leukosis or even Meriks (although more likely your case is heat and dehydration). Ask your processor to check for tumors on the liver of the birds. Tumors indicate Lymphoid Leukosis. Both diseases are potentially fatal and you may not notice symptoms until the birds are closer to maturity. Merkis can be vaccinated against when you get your hatchlings.\n\nI hope that is helpful.\n\nEdit: BTW this is all in reference to the taller tractor but the changes can be helpful for both. You really may be better off setting up a 3 or 4-pen fixed enclosure that you can rotate the birds in. I think you could get healthier, plumper birds with that setup and probably fit in 20-40 more birds per season if you do. If you do continue to use the tractor though just remember LOW AND SLOW :)",

Didn't really have the materials on hand to do anything else. Hopefully it stays for a bit.\n\nIt 100% would be exceeding 75\u00b0F in there, as the past few days our highs have been 27-31\u00b0C (80-88\u00b0F). Our normal highs for this time of year are about 20\u00b0C/68\u00b0F. We're also in a drought, so the lawn is looking the crappiest we've seen it (this is our sixth summer here). We're figuring on the grass/plants being more bonus food than anything, definitely the main food is our pelleted chicken grower.\n\nI will tell my husband about the roosts/shelf too.\n\nI will tell my husband about the feeder and waterer suggestions. The shorter tractor has a hanging feeder and both tractors have a hanging waterer. They're just on chains or tarp straps, so he should be able to lower them a bit more. Need to get more water nipples and then we can whip up a couple more 5 gallon pail waterers.\n\nFor moving the tractors, they have a strap or cable and my husband pulls them with the truck. We try our best with low and slow. He's hoping to get an old lawn mower going, as it will be easier to go slow than in the Sierra 1500. I bang on the back to make sure the birds move, and watch/listen for anyone getting a foot stuck. Someone on Reddit last year said that they had success with putting a pipe across the back at chest height or slightly lower to \"push\" them but not allow them to get stuck/dragged under the heavy parts. I will remind my husband to do this ASAP. The taller tractor has those wheels in the back, not sure if we can lower them, as then there will be a gap and one dog already showed signs of trying to dig if he saw an opening when it wasn't sitting quite right. The shorter tractor is just dragged.\n\nI'll make sure we ask the processor about Lymphoid Leukosis and Meriks next Friday. We did get the medicated chicken starter feed for the first month, not sure if that includes Mericks or not (will look for info on the feed bag).\n\nWe are running a second batch (just got the chicks on Friday, picture of the brooder in our garage [here](https://imgur.com/a/zecbPVt). I think my husband said he got 115 chicks this time, vs 75 or 80 last time. We are hoping to supplement the feed more with other stuff for the second batch - last year we we got for free 54L/14 gallons of full fat sour cream that worked great.",

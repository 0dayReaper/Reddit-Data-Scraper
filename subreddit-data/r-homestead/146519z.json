    "postText": "One of my silver lace baby chicks just died. It seems so random and out of nowhere!! Literally just a couple hours after my last check. Went from happy and fine in her little group, to just dead on the floor. No evidence of animal attack, no blood or feathers anywhere, just on the floor dead! \nWhy would this happen?! I\u2019ve only had this happen when a really bad ant infestation was nearby the hutch, but like wtf?! \n\nThey\u2019re in a safe enclosed hutch for now, 3-5 weeks or so. Plenty of feed water clean bedding\u2026 I\u2019m truly stumped!!",

Sometimes there's nothing you can do.",

    "postText": "I planted ~200 chestnuts last fall. Of these, ~95% were eaten by squirrels or otherwise failed to germinate. 3-4% germinated but were killed, probably by fungus after months of soggy conditions. This Darwinian gauntlet has left me with three, beautiful, flourishing seedlings (as well as another individual barely clinging to life and probably one or two stragglers I've failed to relocate).\n\nI think my three surviving uberchesten now deserve some TLC to protect them from the area's rodents and overpopulated deer. What options do I have for protecting these seedlings that wouldn't require any digging that would disturb their roots?",

            "comment": "Na.  I don't really care for the UX.  The whole format just isn't for me.  I like longer content where I can just let someone blather about a topic while I wash some dishes or have a shower or whatever.  And it's harder to \"customize\" your feed to things of interest.  No matter how much I only watch gardening for weeks on end, I still get random teens doing stupid dances shoved in my face just because they're trending.\n\nThis may be something that tiktok has now but didn't waaaaaaaay back when I had an acct... but I like that on both IG and YT I can save videos to lists.  And since many people repost their tiktoks to youtube anyways, I can save them to a playlist there organized and categorized and actually find it later when I'm not sitting on the toilet or waiting for food.\n\nIt just seems like Youtube is better at pushing content relevant to what I've actually been watching.  And TT was always pushing whatever was viral or whatever they wanted to become viral?\n\nSo back when I used it, I thought of TT more as a mindless doomscrolling source rather than an interface where it was actually easy to connect and follow someone.\n\nAnd I lost all patience with all the \"part 1/part 2\" videos where there's no way to link the videos together.  So you just spend waaaaaaaaay too much time digging in someone's profile, trying to find a video where they have on the same shirt or something.  Yeah.  No thanks.  That got old fast.  (maybe they've fixed that by now, too?)",

Had some rapid growth for a while then someone jacked my video and it's like all attention went to him, giving him millions of views and 100k+ followers. Now I can't get a video to get more than 3k views with most being at 300. My original goal was to hopefully fund, at least in part, my homestead. But that's not looking likely. I'm in nearly every monetization option there is and get squat from it. Considering starting something completely separate from all this algorithm stuff. Not sure exactly what yet. But I need to do something that's actually going to generate money.",

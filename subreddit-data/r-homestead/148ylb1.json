    "postText": "Does anyone have experience with the new models of Mighty Mule gate openers, the x71 series? We've had a 500 series almost 20 years with relatively little trouble but from what I've read it looks like they aren't made as well anymore. Got to replace the old one and I haven't decided yet whether to stick with Mighty Mule or go with Ghost or something else. I'd appreciate helpful advice, and thanks in advance --",

                    "comment": "Short answer -- can't narrow the problem down enough to know for sure what to replace &amp; trial and error replacing parts could quickly cost as much as a new opener.\n\nI've kept notes from troubleshooting over the years (Mighty Mule used to be very helpful) and can't figure out for sure where the problem is.  The beep code says it's a short in the arm but the motor works connected directly to a battery and I've taken new wire and bypassed the cable to rule it out.  We had an old arm, tried it &amp; got a beep code for the revolution counter, changed it, got the beep code for a short in the arm.  In my notes I had a test to use a jumper to determine whether the problem is in the arm or the main board, and the jumper test says it's not the main board.  So everything says it's in the arm but we've pretty much ruled out everything in the arm.  I even did some continuity testing to see if I could confirm that way that there is a short.\n\nMy uncle and a friend looked at it and called tech support, the tech heard the beep code for the arm over the phone, told them it's the main board and got off the phone.  I didn't talk to the tech, so I don't know if he's right or if he is only familiar with the current models or if he just wanted to get them off the phone, but since he said that when he heard the beep code for the arm, I'm not convinced. I'd buy the board if I knew that was the problem, but since I'm not sure I decided I'd just spend another hundred and get a whole new gate opener (if I stick with the Mighty Mule and don't have to replace any of the add-ons).  Before I do that though, I've been researching to decide if I'd be better off spending a bit more and going with a different brand.  Articles on gate openers still list Mighty Mule generally either best or second for user installed gate openers, but user reviews of the current models made me want to check in here.  I've seen some reviews mentioning plastic gears in the arm as well as the shaft easily bending in the arm on the new model.",

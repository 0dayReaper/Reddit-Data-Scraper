    "postText": "For people who have small acreage and deer pressure what have you done about fencing? We have 4.25 acres and we\u2019re torn on if we just want to do little sections of fencing around our projects or go full throttle and do an 8 feet fixed knot steel type of fence around the entire property. This is mainly for deer as we have incredibly deer pressure and anything not fenced off and at deer height will be gone in one night. \n\nRight now we have a small orchard of 30 something fruit trees, blueberry / strawberry patches, raised beds, and about an acre of native plantings. They\u2019re all just fenced off with some janky chicken mesh. \n\nSo if you\u2019ve had something similar what did you end up doing to protect your projects? (I\u2019m not killing the deer as a solution, they\u2019ll just keep coming in droves and I only have so much freezer space)",

The remaining acres you might decide to fence down the road for keeping livestock in, and could do a shorter fence that would still allow deer in.\n\nHaving deer on the property is a pretty great meat source with very little time investment, should you decide to start hunting a few each year. We have been relying on deer as our primary protein source, but we don't get deer on the property as reliably as you do. I've got a buddy whose property is similar to yours (6-12 does on the property every day without fail), and they've been able to focus all their attention on gardening/orchard/chickens since they're guaranteed a good meat source every fall.\n\nI'm envious of the position you're in! Even if it's not a resource you tap in to now, keeping a door open to it being a resource you utilize down the road would make sense.\n\nMy other thought is fencing your whole property in 8' fencing might decrease the aesthetics somewhat. I get that homesteading isn't a manicured lawn contest, but high fencing all the way around the property could look a little more prison yard-ish than you'd like.",

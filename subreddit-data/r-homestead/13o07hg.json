You don't want those suckers growing normally.  \n\n\nIf that is a peach tree or most stone fruit, you should top it off.  It looks like someone already did that once about halfway up.  Then you pick a few branches just below to be your main branches going forward.  Sometimes other trees are pruned the same way but you need to be training a young tree almost from the beginning to have success later on.  \n\n\nGive it some time and see what happens before you cut it.  Scratch the bark above where it was topped off before with you thumbnail.  If you see green under the bark you should be good.  If it is brown and dried out that is a problem.",

Those suckers from the rootstock are not your tree though.  You could graft another apple onto the rootstock next spring if you choose and your tree is dead.  Your graft would inherit established roots.  Something to think about.",

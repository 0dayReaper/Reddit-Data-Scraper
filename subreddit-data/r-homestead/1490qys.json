    "postText": "So we live in  northern Scandinavia, and for you Americans that's about the same as northern Canada/Alaska. \n\nSo we are haven't had rain for over a month and that is most likely climate change. But we are not used to it or how to deal with it. \n\nWe have a ground water well. And we got two rain water reservoir of 1000L(264gallons) each. But they are empty right now because no rain. \nWe don't want to risk the well to get empty by weathering our veggies and our Pond (we have ducks). \n\nThe problem is that we have light almost 23 h a day this time of year. And growing season is 5 months, 6 it we are lucky with temperature. The rest of the year is winter. We put the seeds in at may and frost comes in September/oktober.  So we really need to squeeze out as much grouth as possible during those months. Usually we have rain regularly during summer. So we don't have to think about watering to much.  But not this year. \n\nSo do you southerns have any hacks we need to know?? I'm happy to trade for snow hacks. \u263a\ufe0f",

I can see my neighbours watering daily in dry season, while I only have to give water to the beds once a week.\n\nSince I use cutted grass for mulching, this also adds to the soil quality over time.\n\nIt's easy to do and doesn't cost anything.

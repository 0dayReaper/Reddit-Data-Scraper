So you could get 13, but what if the spare was a rooster?  14.  Then at least two get eaten by predators because it\u2019s your first time.  16 chickens.  \n\nThen only two are rooster and they all thrive for five years.  \n\nBut yeah,  every time I buy more chickens I add a few extra because unfortunately chickens die easily.",

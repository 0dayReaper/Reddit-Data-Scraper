Now they hang out in the edges munching on all sorts of weeds, bugs, you name it. However, their proper run is lined in an herb bed. A few things I planted for them (borage and sweet potato vine - hoping it would become a shade as well). The borage was eaten really quickly. Next year I will have protection for young plants. They use the area as their favorite dust bath, which has killed a few. Everything there is for benefit to them, or at least a treat. That is fair game. Some herbs I won\u2019t receive much from, so I will plant elsewhere next year. But what are you gonna do?",

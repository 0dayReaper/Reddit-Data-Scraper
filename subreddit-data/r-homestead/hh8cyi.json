They often work with your local university\u2019s extension office so you might be able to interact with someone knowledgeable about adapting tools. Additionally, look into horticultural therapy for some assistance as well.\n\nI applaud your determination and drive to achieve what you have. It\u2019s admirable and truly inspiring.

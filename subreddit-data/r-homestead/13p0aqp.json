    "postText": "Hoping for some input from those that sell at farmers markets. Right now I focus on older desserts from late 1800s to mid 1900s. I\u2019ve been going to farmers markets for recon as I\u2019m getting ready to start selling this summer and I\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019m not seeing varieties at stalls. I See bread booths, jam booths, cake booths, cookie booths, but no booths with more mixed desserts. My current menu is all over the place in types of desserts. Should I swap up my menu and focus on one type of food? I have lots of cinnamon roll recipes, breads, and jams. Or do you have success selling multiple types of desserts. Thank you!",

Its takes less time to make 50 jars of jelly in one flavor than to make 50 different flavors. \n\nThe same across anything you decide to go with. I would suggest in the beginning to try several different items for a while and over time you will start to see a pattern of what sells and what does not. \n\nAnother option is to start with just breads and see how it goes. You can also place some kind of menu on your table and communicate with people that you could offer other items as well.\n\nMaybe even use the menu to pre sell items with a deposit and bring their purchase on your next set up. \n\nSetting up in a farmers market can be lots of fun but the end of the day it is about profit. \n\nI wish you the world going forward",

To be honest, some of them were not that good.  \n\nI remember another vendor who had home made mints, desserts, cut flowers, and produce on the same table.  \n\nDo what motivates you.  Old desserts sounds like a valid marketing theme.",

            "comment": "This sounds delicious! I would say to start, make one type of dessert and bring a photo menu of others. \n\nThink about your strategy: are you selling something people will consume at the market? (Aka lemonade, ice cream, etc) Or is this something they\u2019ll be taking home? You could say both, but keep in mind that for eating at the market you may want to portion/price/package differently to make it more enticing! Also, choose your location at the market near other food vendors, like a food truck, and sell beverages as well. Maybe cold brew coffees or sweet tea! (Both can be premade at home easy enough and have a nice markup!) \n\nI can absolutely see this being a huge hit in city famers markets! Lots of people stroll through those for dates and a handheld dessert is perfect!",

I would go with your favorites to begin with and provide taste samples.  I would make signage telling some of the history of your wares. I know of Springerle, but not sure of springerlein unless the \"lein\" ending indicates small.",

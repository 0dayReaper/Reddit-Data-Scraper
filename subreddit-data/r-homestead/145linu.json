People say they are stupid, but I'm not convinced. You have to use a gun covered in camouflage to hunt turkeys because they know what a gun looks like. I think the broad breasted turkeys seem stupid because they in general move fairly slow. Mine took to foraging after watching my adult chickens doing it in the covered run, before that they couldn't figure out how to eat without a feeder. Chickens seem smarter, but I think they are just more curious when young. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got three broad breasted poults from someone else of unknown age, but they were about the size of a 7-8 week old heritage chick. The 5 week old chicks tried to fight them at first, so I had to keep them separated but able to see each other. After a week of that the chicks and poults got along fine. The turkeys do not fight back against the chickens, they try to run and hide. After two weeks keeping my mixed age flock together (6 weeks to 4 years) with the poults, one of my good broody hens decided that the turkeys are definitely not chickens and needed to die. I was lucky and managed to save all three poults before she killed them. Now I'm waiting on a separate housing setup to come via UPS so they can be safe. I may try re-introducing them once they get a bit bigger, but I am skeptical that the chickens will like them any more once they are huge. I'll be sending mine to a processing facility so I can stock them at a local COOP type store.   \n\n\nUnfortunately I have grown a bit soft to the turkeys. One is definitely a male and very sweet on me. The other two appear to be hens and don't care to be touched or handled, but still friendly and happy to see me.",

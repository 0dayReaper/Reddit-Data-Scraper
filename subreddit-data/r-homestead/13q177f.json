            "comment": "We hang our food dispenser from a rafter support, high enough off the floor that vermin can't reach it, (see my additional below)  but accessible to the chickens. This location is away from any overhead perching points, to avoid the inevitable poop contamination. The water is placed against a wall, with an automatic filler system &amp; ensuring that there are no overhead perching chickens. \n\nI should add, our coop is raised up on concrete blocks, approximately 1.2Meters off the ground, and the entrance door does not drop down towards the ground either. It is like a drawbridge, a thin sturdy wire keeps it parallel to the ground, the  chickens learn very quickly to hop up &amp; down &amp; this stops rats etc from gaining access to the coop. Before I set up this arrangement, it was a constant struggle to keep the rats etc out! \n\nHope this helps, good luck!",

They kick dirt and poo in it if left on the ground.",

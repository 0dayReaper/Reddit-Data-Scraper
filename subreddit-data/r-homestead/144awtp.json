    "postText": "So I have 30 chickens and 3 ducks in a fenced area of 100\u2019x100\u2019.  My female duck has been brooding and just hatched her first clutch of eggs- maybe 6-10 ducklings..I have a brooder inside the chicken coop where I have 10 turkeys that I hatched 9 days ago.  My question is- should I collect the ducklings and put them in the brooder to protect them, or will momma duck get upset?  I am concerned that the food and water for the chickens and ducks are in the coop and don\u2019t think the ducklings will be able to make it into it.. or make it through the gauntlet of full grown chickens.  Should I put some food and water next to the ducklings and momma instead?",

            "comment": "not sure about ducklings and chickens - but if the duck sat on the eggs in that location - it should be ok for the ducklings and mother there now. The mother should protect the ducklings (each duck variety can be slightly different). Note I am in Australia - presuming you are in USA - so we don't have to consider mountain lions / cougars etc\n\nducklings needs special duckling food (mother can still eat it - it's just more expensive) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the water for the ducklings - be careful as ducklings can not swim yet, so you have to make it that the ducklings can get out of the bucket.",

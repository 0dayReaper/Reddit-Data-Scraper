What can all five of the people in town do to stop them? You share the road with deer, possum carcasses, and buzzards. The self-proclaimed ruler of them all is no other than the Trash dog himself. \"Coons\" the size of a small child, and smarter than the run-down community college. \n\nFun fact about the raccoons, they are a mafia, they will catch you dying of dehydration and hold a bottle-cap of water right in front of you. Evil (but cute). They also LOVE corn, and will do anything to get it. Your pathetic scarecrows will do NOTHING. So you buy motion-activated LED lights to try and spook them. Nothing. Alarm? Nothing. Dogs? Those are their dogs now.\n\nSo what do you do? \n\nPlant extra corn to appease your new landlords..",

In my front yard and the pasture surrounding it on 3 sides I have a minimum of 10 deer at almost all times of the day.  At least 6 fawns this year and a couple yearlings from last year.  And they are losing their fear of humans.  My yard is beginning to look like a fortress because I've had to fence/cage things in if I want anything to grow.  All my fruit trees have 4' high wire rings around them because even when the trees get to the 3-4 year mark, the bucks will come rub the trunks raw in the fall.  My garden has a 6' fence around it, which keeps the deer out but unfortunately not the groundhogs, raccoons and chipmunks.",

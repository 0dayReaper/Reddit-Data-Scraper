    "postText": "\nEach morning I\u2019ve been waking up to more and more tree damage. I\u2019ve been extremely busy, so no time to buy and set a live trap, but this coming week I will be free. However the current pace of which the damage is taking place is becoming alarming. This monster already girdled one chinese plum and now he\u2019s coming for my pear trees and the two remaining plums. I think it\u2019s either a beaver or a woodchuck. Any insight on how I can catch this creature and attempt to heal my trees would be much appreciated. Seems like the damage is coming at night.",

I live in an area of Alberta that has a LOT of beavers and their chew marks are more concentrated (rather than all over the trunk as in your pictures) as their goal is to bring the tree down and use it in their dams.  Their evidence looks more like axe marks into one side of the trunk, rather than stripping the outer bark off like in your photos.  [This is what beaver damage looks like](https://www.wildlifeillinois.org/gallery/animal-sign/tree-damage/beaver-damage/).  Beavers also tend to target trees close to water bodies (so they don't have to drag the tree as far). \n\nWe also have porcupines and this is what the damage they do looks like.  We don't have woodchucks, so I can't really chime in on that.",

However, the tree that had the lower part of it debarked looks very much like porcupine damage (although a beaver might do that as well). If you're dealing with just one animal, it's a beaver (or several beavers).\n\nI would put metal around the trees. Half-inch hardware cloth, sheet metal/flashing, or something similar, enclosing the trunk and as high up as 3 feet. You can trap or shoot the beavers but it'll take a long time to get them all, you might never get them all, and more will inevitably show up. A couple of bucks worth of hardware cloth and the problem is solved.",

Idk how tall those trees are if they are within 3ft of the ground this is what it might be and if your near a water source (like a small stream) this could be your culprit.

You put a lead weight on a line, with a little bent pice of metal, so they can swim closer to the weight. Then you don\u2019t have to go out and shoot them, especially if you have neighbors. I would also recommend getting som of the sent stuff, and placing in on a stick 3ft above the trap. The goal is to get their back foot, in the trap.

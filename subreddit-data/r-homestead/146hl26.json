            "comment": "Getting animals to pay for themselves isn't that hard, getting them to pay for you as well is where things get tricky.\n\nChickens are a good starter animal - you can generally legally sell the eggs without much hassle (check out the cottage food laws in your state for specifics), and at a small scale a lot of the food can be kitchen scraps or from free ranging, which lowers your cost. I sell mine at prices that are comparable to similar eggs at the store, which covers feed costs plus a bit, and then I get free eggs for myself.\n\nDairy is the next thing to look at - goats or sheep will work best at small scale (cows require large animal experience). Bees can also be good, although they have hefty startup costs. \n\nNiche livestock can be profitable either for breeding or for a specific market - quail and duck, for example, aren't raised commercially at nearly the scale of chickens or cows. \n\nMeat animals are usually hard to make money from because the cost is tied to the feed, and butchering requirements can be tricky or expensive - both of these things mean large scale producers have much lower costs, so you need a niche product or an unconventional way of feeding the animals. Similar deal for fiber, only there it's the fiber processing costs that will hurt you at a small scale.",

            "comment": "Chickens can pay for themselves, provide you with eggs plus put a little cash in your pocket. But be warned chickens are a gate way animal to homesteading. We also have meat rabbits. They provide you with good meat at $2 to three $3 dollars a pound for us. I consider money not spent at the grocery store profit. We sell a few live ones as breeding stock at swaps or on Craig\u2019s list. That pays for their feed. If you don\u2019t want to eat them you can sell them all. Around here they sell for $10 to $30 dollars each depending on the market, where you sell them and breed. Both of these are low maintenance animals. Quail can be profitable. We make most of our money with quail by selling pickled quail eggs. All of these take up remarkably little space, minimal financial investment (I say minimal not none) and relatively little labor. For these you can build your own enclosures. \n\nStepping up to larger animals like goats sheep and cattle requires more money, financial investment, knowledge and work. The infrastructure also becomes a lot more expensive. You\u2019ll need fencing a way to water them and larger shelters. \n\nWhat you can do will depend on how much space you have, what state, county and city you are in. In Missouri I can sell eggs, live animals and a limited amount of things like pickled quail eggs and goat milk without getting in trouble. We even have \u201csmall animal swaps\u201d where people gather on the auction barn parking lot on Saturday morning to sell our animals and products. From what I understand in California it\u2019s another story completely. Profitability will also depend on where you live. Cost of feed and hay can very greatly by region. As an example, I\u2019m paying $4 a square bail. I have a friend on the west coast who is paying almost double that. I go through about one square bail a day with my goats. So over a year that cost will add up. And this brings up another issue. Can your animals get natural brows. When my goats can get natural brows the hay consumption drops to zero. \n\nAs you can see there are a lot of issues that will play into profitability. Some of these you can control and others you can\u2019t.",

            "comment": "To put it bluntly no. \n\nEveryone mentioning chickens is overlooking that realistically it's going to cost you $2000 for your first bunch(six) of chickens. From *there* it's easy to expand; but, the initial start up costs is *a lot*. You *can* cut the costs if you can DIY well or repurpose items. For example I converted a shed into a coop for my flock. \n\nThe main issue is that people grossly overlook predator proofing or are a bit dishonest in explaining their setups. For example they might show a picture of their birds behind regular chicken wire fence and leave out that the whole set up is behind an electric fence. Anyone who knows chicken wire will know that pretty much *any* predator can rip though it with ease. \n\nAnother thing to consider is what you can *legally* sell. In my state (NY) selling a live grown out cornish cross goes from $0.99/lbs if I butcher myself to $3.99/lbs if I have them processed which I would have to if I wanted to legally sell them. That doesn't include me being paid. So at the end you'd be looking at trying to sell a someone a $6/lbs bird. Likewise all eggs have to be washed before being sold. This means that if I want to sell eggs I would have to run an extension cord to the end of my driveway with a minifridge to a produce cart. \n\nThe only *real* money I've seen people make is selling purebred breeding stock. But that comes with a heavy initial investment and will take up a ton of your time and energy. I think a lot of people forget that often successful people are successful because they put 120% effort *everyday* rain or shine into what they are doing.",

Really you just need paddock or a large pen that is very secure (pigs can uproot poorly done fencing).\n  Getting 2-4 feeder pigs will pay for themselves (and you\u2019ll keep one for the freezer) and you can gauge whether you want to do it again or raise even more.\n  Fodder is relatively cheap and gets cheaper if you go to your local grocery store to pick up loads of off or \u201cspoiled\u201d produce, usually just cabbages that look bad on the surface or bread that\u2019s past it\u2019s best-by date. I work in kitchens so I\u2019ve taken home lots of food waste and vegetable scraps, you can see if any local restaurants will allow you to leave trash cans or five gallon buckets for \u201ccompost.\u201d Just be aware that the workers aren\u2019t always attentive and you might get an odd plastic glove in there. I\u2019ve heard breweries can provide you with spent grain, which is really good fodder and dairies can give you whey, which is great for the taste of the meat. \n  I really love pigs and if I didn\u2019t have my hands full right now with all of the crazy high input homestead stuff we already have going I\u2019d have a couple of feeder pigs constantly.",

            "comment": "If you want to go the chicken route:\n\nLook up Pastured Poultry Profits by Joel Salatin. It's a quick and easy intro to raising chickens and will give you a realistic outlook on costs/effort.\n\nWe raise about 90 meat chickens per year for personal use but scaling isn't difficult with chickens. Important thing is to rotate the chicken tractors daily if you are using fresh pasture to graze them. Supplement with extra feed to help plump them up.\n\nWe also raise lambs and sell to a local butcher. Lambs are very low maintenance once you hace everything set up and going. That said- You're going to need solid perimeter fence with no gaps they can escape through. This will most likely require a good amount of hogwire fixed to an existing wooden fence or ample t-posts for structure. \n\nWe run about 30 lambs, rotating between 4 pastures equating roughly 3.5 acres. Those pastures are split into roughly 1/4 acre parcels using livewire. We run those parts of fencing off the property's main power and supplement it a little bit with solar.\n\nThe lambs are rotated daily between parcels to prevent overgrazing and the parcel that was grazed most recently is the next to be watered. We use a small pump and grandfathered water rights on an adjacent river to irrigate.\n\nLambs were $150 each this year averaging 118lbs at pickup. After transport costs, vaccinations, and the sweet grain used near the end to fatten them up a bit more, each lamb comes in around $215 each. \n\nDressed weight ranges from 60-75lbs per lamb, we hoping around 70lb average this round. Butcher pays $10/lb wholesale. Profit about $500 per lamb, give or take a few bucks. \n\nAfter the initial lamb delivery and making sure the land is ready, time commitment is 30-45min per day. We only run 1 herd per year but $14-$15k is a nice profit for the effort.",

            "comment": "As the sun rose over the rolling hills of my homestead, I gazed out at my fields and animals, feeling the sense of pride that came from years of hard work and dedication. I had always been passionate about sustainable living and self-sufficiency, and over time I had turned my small farm into a thriving enterprise.\n\nBut it wasn't until I stumbled upon an article on Reddit one fateful day that my life truly changed. It was titled \"Animals that I can make money off of without it being a full-time job\", and it caught my eye immediately. I clicked through to the post and found myself reading about a new way to earn income from my beloved farm animals - affiliate marketing.\n\nI had heard about affiliate marketing before, but it had never really piqued my interest. I didn't think it had anything to do with the kind of lifestyle I was living. But as I read on, I realized that this was something I could do. I had an online presence and a loyal following of like-minded individuals who were interested in what I was doing. By partnering with companies that offered products relevant to my homesteading lifestyle, I could earn commissions on sales that I helped generate.\n\nI did my research and found the perfect affiliate program to join. It was a company that sold high-quality farming equipment and livestock supplies, and I knew that it was something my followers would be interested in. I started promoting their products through my website and social media channels, and the results were almost immediate.\n\nAt first, the commissions trickled in slowly. But as I continued to promote the products and expand my reach online, the sales began to snowball. People were buying the products I recommended, and I was earning a percentage of every sale. It was a win-win situation - my followers got great products that they needed, and I got to earn a passive income from something that I loved doing anyway.\n\nI kept at it, continuing to promote the affiliate products and growing my audience at the same time. And before I knew it, I had earned over $100,000 in commissions from the program.\n\nIt was an incredible feeling, knowing that I had been able to turn my passion into a thriving business. And it all started with a simple post on Reddit. To anyone out there who's thinking about affiliate marketing but isn't sure if it's right for them, my advice is this: just go for it. You never know where it might take you. Check this out: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1WI5Gm9khdocnPQZae6lS0UfGetHUCPI7",

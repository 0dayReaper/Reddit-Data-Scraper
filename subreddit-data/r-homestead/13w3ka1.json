They\u2019re friendly and entertaining but ultimately goats being goats make them annoying at times for the areas I put them from time to time, such as climbing my duck coop. \nI\u2019m planning on adding sheep now to take their place, I\u2019m looking at 3 breeds, St. Croix, for which Ik a great breeder, American Black belly, aesthetic af, and katahdin, larger carcass and more available in my area. I\u2019ve found breeders for each, didn\u2019t know if y\u2019all thought I should go with carcass size &gt; the hardiness of the other two breeds. I will also be using them to train border collies if that matters, so the ABB may be too wily.",

            "comment": "I mean I love my Katahdin but can say you need to spring for good genetics because there are absolutely rubbish Katahdins out there. Also all the colors of the sheep rainbow \ud83e\udde1. Also they are docile and EXCELLENT breeders. I had one of my three year olds drop quads and momma like a pro. St. Croix can be good but decent carcass sized ones are hard to find, also a genetic thing that not that many breeders go for. I also rarely worm my Katahdin and they have great parasite resistance \ud83d\udc4c. The traits you want are all what good Katahdin breeders select for, I can\u2019t speak to the others because I decided on Kats and have loved them and never looked back. I\u2019d also add feet and legs into the mix because trimming is a pain. Best of luck and update with pics when you get your flock!",

I like the color variety of the kats a lot + the carcass, the guy I\u2019m talking to about St. Croix has registered stock &amp; actually knows Joel Salatin so Ik his line is top shelf",

Also you can get a colored Katahdin ram and put him to some nice St. Croix and you should get some great and colorful babies \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Yes I said, well they are all standing on her new Lincoln Town Car and would I come get them.\nGot over there and shined a light and was relieved to find that on her car were not goats at all, but our other neighbor's sheep. But the goats were a pain besides.",

Never got the goats back either, they wear collars and someone 2 counties over found them &amp; we just let him keep them since it was 8 months after they escaped.",

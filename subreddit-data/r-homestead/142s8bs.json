You're basically saying \"I have a golden retriever and a labrador retriever.  They're litter mates, only difference is one is blonde\".  But they're actually two different breeds entirely.  \n\nPembrokes are smaller, shorter, and have more pointed ears (also, like I said, I don't think pembrokes have the genetic marker to be merle/blue).  Cardigans are larger with a bigger skeleton, slightly different build (stockier with almost turned in legs, like a bulldog, almost), and their ears are larger and more rounded.  If you breed a Pembroke with a Cardigan, you get what's called an American Corgi.  Kind of like how mixing a Golden Retriever and a Labrador Retriever gets you a \"Goldador\" not a litter of some labradors and some goldens.",

They're likely either Cardigans or American Corgis (a cross between cardigan and pembroke).\n\nEither way, they're adorable and corgis are amazing so you're in for a fantastic addition to the family!",

She's 15 now.  But the vet says she's in great shape for her age so we're hopeful she'll stick around a while.",

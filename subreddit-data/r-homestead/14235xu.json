    "postText": "We have 2 pear trees, 4 apple trees (this is the first year they all look like they have a decent amount of fruit), and a few mulberry trees. This is the first year I have decided I\u2019d like to try to harvest/preserve as many as I can instead of letting them go to waste. \n\nWhat are your favourite things to do with excess pears, apples and mulberries? I was thinking maybe a jam for the berries? \n\nEverything feels so new so I don\u2019t even know where to begin my research lol\n\nAlso bonus question: what is your favourite natural pesticide for apple trees?",

Then I throw the slices into a lemon juice/water bath as I slice them to preserve the color, and dehydrate them.  Storing in vacuum sealed mason jars keeps them from going stale and we have dehydrated pear and apple slices for the next couple of years.  This works out well because late frosts tend to freeze off baby apples every other year.  Slicing thinly is the key, and you don\u2019t have to peel them if you don\u2019t want to.",

    "postText": "There is a new TV show in crowdfunding about Homesteading. I stumbled upon it by chance and haven't seen any mention of it on here. If anyone wants to watch the trailer and invest, I would be extremely happy, as I really want to watch it. I'm sure alot of you would also. I haven't been this excited about a TV show in years. \n\nHomestead:\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=oA2qNCgjHSA&amp;feature=share",

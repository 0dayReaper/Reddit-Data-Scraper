We have a large garden, chickens, turkeys, rabbits, and have just been offered a free milk goat by a friend. I say all that to say goats are by far the largest animal and task to add to our homestead thus far. Any tips or tricks to consider? We\u2019re planning out our pen now - thinking of a goat tractor? Thank you all in advance!",

            "comment": "Electric fence is your friend. And you'll want at least two fences between the goats and garden. \nI'd do a welded wire fence around the garden with electric on the outside, then fence in the goats with electric, and if I could I'd have another wire fence between all that. My saying is \"you can have goats, or you can have a garden, but not both.\" Someone else said \"you can build a fence horse high, bull strong, and pig tight, but the goats will still get out\"\n\nOh, and you'll need company for the goat, they are herd animals and won't like being alone. Oh, and donkeys can be good herd guardians, and so are Great Pyrenees",

If you are changing feed, get some of her old feed and blend into the new .\n\nShe will not be happy alone so get her at least one other goat for company.\n\nA hot wire offset inside a wire or panel fence works best. They can be trained to electronet but it needs to stay hot..they'll constantly test it.",

He would wait until we turned our heads and grab a quick snack of the fruit trees or anything else which took his fancy. Sure miss having him around, he was a good goat/dog like creature.",

            "comment": "Goats are relatively easy animals to care for and I consider them to be good starter animals. They will become attached to you and enjoy your company if you treat them kindly which means they\u2019re easy enough to work with. \n\nThere are just a few things to consider about goats: \n\n- Goats need at least one friend (whether that\u2019s another goat or something like a sheep or alpaca). \n\n- You\u2019re also going to have to really assess your fences. They will escape if there is even the slightest weakness. When you repair one part of the fence, they will move onto the next weakness. If the fence is electric, it has to be kept hot because they will constantly test it. \n\n- Goats do best when they\u2019re grazing a pasture but some plants are poisonous to goats. They will also eat hay/pellets/grain if/when kept inside a barn. \n\n- If you live in a colder/wetter area you\u2019ll need to consider shelter (most goat breeds come from warmer climates and prefer to stay toasty but can tolerate colder weather just not snow/ice) as well as hoof health. Get your goats used to handling their hooves early on. \n\n- The smaller the goat, the higher they jump. They may look cute and manageable but Pygmies are little escape artists hell bent on getting into things they shouldn\u2019t lmao. \n\nHope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

We have pasture land for them to graze on, just having to assess our fence situation. Thank you so much though!!!",

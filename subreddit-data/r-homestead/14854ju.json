    "postText": "We just did a home inspection on the 52 acre property that we are about to buy. \n\nWhen we were there over a month ago there was no mosquitoes which was surprising seeing as it was on the river and had some small waterways going through the land that also had some standing water.\n\nThis time however, the mosquitoes were thick. The homeowner had said that it rains for 3 days which would account for some of it. There's quite a bit of standing water by the river away from the house and there's some standing water within 100 meters of the house.\n\nI'm hoping this is something that we can mitigate because if the property is going to have that many mosquitoes it's just not something that we want to live with.\n\nAny of you have experience mitigating mosquitoes on a waterfront and fairly wet property I would love to hear it.",

I make sure that all standing water is drained, including gutter maintenance. I have had what seems like success using a product called [Mosquito Dunks ](https://summitchemical.com/products/mosquito-dunks/), an organic larvicide in a water fountain.  I also run a Skeeter Vac about 100 feet from the house.  Finally, I do try to keep the overgrowth down near outdoor areas we use.\n\nSome years are worse than others, but in 20 years, only one stands out as being miserable. We are not opposed to using repellents as needed, and I do find a [ThermaCELL](https://www.thermacell.com/) to be effective if there is not much breeze. Also, evening and dusk are the worse times, so avoid those hours if possible if they are really bad.",

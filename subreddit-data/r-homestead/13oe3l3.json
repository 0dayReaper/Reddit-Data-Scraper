Assuming you keep them out of strong wind and rain. \n\nLast year I kicked mine out of the brooder probably a week earlier with lows around 50. Left a heat lamp in the chicken tractor for less than a week after that.",

Takes about 12 weeks to get to 5lbs but they are better tasting than Cornish X and are more like a real chicken. If that makes sense. I\u2019ve had better luck getting big red broilers over 5lbs than I have had with freedom rangers. \n\nMy last batch of freedom rangers took 14 weeks to average 4.5 lbs. vs the big red broilers took 12 weeks to average 5.5lbs. But also the feed I could access was different. Be worth trying both and seeing what you like.",

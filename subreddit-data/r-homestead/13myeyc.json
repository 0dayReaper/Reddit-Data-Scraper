These vaccinations can vary by your location and the vet will be a great resource for that. Also super handy to have someone to call and ask questions to. \n\nCattle are probably one of the easiest animals to keep. If they are happy and healthy it's clean sailing.",

They are cheap and as long as you vaccinate quite healthy. \n\nBottle calves aren't for the faint of heart and require more time and experience. If you could find some 200lb holsteins that have been on some grain a couple weeks it'd be an affordable and relatively easy way to gain some experience. Get them on some fresh grass and supplement with a little calf starter. \n\nRegardless of what the seller says fully vaccinate them yourself. We do most all our own vet work and it's only $15/head or so. Just let the vet know what you have and they'll set you up with everything you need to keep them healthy. Also worm them with some ivermectin right away to avoid parasites. \n\nIf you got any questions or I missed something just ask. Good luck!",

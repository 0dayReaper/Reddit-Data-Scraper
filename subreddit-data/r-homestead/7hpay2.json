There's a preliminary apron onto the lot and a bit of barbed wire fencing on 2 sides.  The lot is almost a perfect square, 450x450, which makes my inner perfectionist very happy.\n\n\nMy stab in the dark at the next 5 years -\n\n2018: Build utility shed (12x12?) with solar power and rain barrels, buy a used garden tractor and get some hop and asparagus crowns in the ground.  Likely spending some weekends out on the lot in our 16ft Scamp during the summer. Start learning how the ground drains and determining where we want to add trees for wind break without reducing solar capabilities.\n\n2019:  Some tree planting, gravel driveway, and perimeter fencing.\n\n2020: Seriously starting architectural decisions for house, build pole barn and bring electrical into barn.\n\n2021: Well for water, interior fencing\n\n2022: build wife's dream house with a room for my home brewing supplies in basement",

Unfortunately that's my limit, I couldn't live more than that from a restaurant or coffee shop. Montana is absolutely GIGANTIC, and most of the cities are located in the western region (the exception being Billings which is kind of a barren wasteland). The cheap land is all in the Eastern region which is extremely dry and empty. No people, no trees, barely even grass. Some people like it, it's not my cup of tea and I surely wouldn't want to homestead there.",

I am myself a DAR, with several ancestors who fought in the Revolutionary War locally, the most famous of whom was [Mary Patton](http://www.tndar.org/~marypatton/).  \n\nBut, speaking as someone who was born here, moved away and spent 40+ years living in different parts of drug-infested Florida (with many of those years in South Florida, including the 80's when  cocaine was around every corner), the drug problem is out of control here in rural east TN. There's not a lot to do for teens/young adults to do except play sports, or be outdoorsy, or sit inside on a computer all day long. After you rule out people who are satisfied doing those activites for fun you're left with folks who want to do kid things and have exciting lives, and there's not much left for them (as they see it) except to get high and fuck. So they steal things and buy drugs and have babies. The crime rate is high here, as is the unemployment rate, and the drugs keep pouring into the area no matter how much law enforcement tries to stop it. The main employers around here are either agricultural or factory work or fast food. The chicken processing plant here in town is one of the 'big' places to work, as is the eyeglass factory and the shoe factory. \n\nThe lack of excitement and entertainment doesn't really matter much to my husband and me as older people almost to retirement age, as we love to spend time outdoors and we consider this to be a four-season state. There's always something to photograph  or somewhere to hike or somewhere to drive to and say \"ooh pretty!\" but you can bet we've got security cameras as well as a security system on our house and 4-car garage. I know several people who have had their houses broken in to and ransacked and it's always someone looking for drugs or looking for things to sell for 10-cents on the dollar so they can buy drugs. \n\nTennessee isn't the only state like this and east Tennessee in particular isn't the only region that's under seige in the drug war, but  it's definitely something to know about the area.

My parents bought a bunch of property with similar plans and i can see a few short cuts you could make right off the bat based on helping my parents out on their property.\n\n1. if you're going to build a pole barn anyways, skip the 12X12 shed and just build the pole barn. have someone level grade, compact, and gravel the area, along with a road going to it. Ideally it will be big enough to park your 16ft scamp and tractor in it with doors big enough to accommodate this as well as provide some work space and tool/material storage. I wouldn't go less than 20X20 and think 40X40 actually be best. my parents eventually built a 40X40 and my dad wishes he would've gotten the 40X60 but they have several times more acreage and he's a bit of a pack rat. parking the scamp in there will reduce wear and tear on it, won't have to haul it back and forth, just pull it out when you get there. also, cement the floor completely in. much easier to move around equipment, significantly keeps the majority of the moisture out thus mold from going and easier to clean up.\n\n2. Once you have the pole barn up and a general idea where the house will be, get the well installed next. having a consistent water source makes a huge difference. driving the camper in to fill up the tanks or going in town to get more water is a hassle you don't have to deal with if you're planning on getting a well anyways.\n\nit's honestly hard to fathom how we did anything without the pole barn and running water once we got them. i can't stress the pole barn enough. \n\nsome additional thoughts but not as important...\n\n3.not sure what size of tractor you're thinking but i'd go for something above a base line garden tractor. something around 25hp or a bit more. haven't used any other types but the two kubotas i've used regularly have worked out great. attachments like brush hogs and a front loader with grapple are very handy.\n\n4.not sure how much you enjoy dumping your blackwater tank but going with a composting toilet like [this one](https://natureshead.net/) is a more pleasant experience. [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYR6GPmDzVM) of a couple explaining the toilet and how they took out their black water tank toilet and [replaced it with the composting one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp1lESUsSno). or just build a movable outhouse and dig a hole like the good ol' days.\n\nhaving ample, secure, dry storage, a water source, ample equipment, and dumpable sanitation will make things a whole lot more convenient and comfortable.

I had enough presence of mind, when I was building my first home (I was 23 yrs old) to study the various trees that would grow well in our type of soil. I was specifically curious about life-cycle, as some ornamental trees tend to live short lives, and height. \n\nGiven that we often had storms that come up from the south/southwest I made sure not to plant any trees that could end up crushing our house once they reached maturity on the southern or western side of the house. Those types of trees were planted far back, while others, those that didn't get so big they could threaten the structure, were planted closer to the house. \n\nAlso know which trees roots systems tend to cause damage to water lines and septic tanks. \n\nI should mention that yeah, back in the early 80's, it was very possible to build a home on a factory and a retail workers salary. We built a 1600 sq ft 3 bdrm 2 full bath home with a fireplace and double garage..and bought a brand new Mazda. We paid $45k for a brand-new stick built home. Then came Clinton and NAFTA in the early 90's. So long forever good times. Seriously. ",

I imagine you already know but anything that isn't plowed is quickly taken over by trees.  Just look at the tree lines between the fields and encroaching on any unkept ditches along roads.  Definitely not saying to plow, but you'll probably want something to knock down the brush maybe once a year. \n\nTrees grow pretty fast there 3-4 feet/season and theres a lot of apple orchards in the area.  Planting a few Black Walnuts if you have the space would be a nice 20-30 yr investment. \n\nWe never had a need to water our crops or garden.  Any watering you do would be supplemental for rare dry spells or maximizing garden growth.  Those rain barrels are a real good start and you can expand from there if needed.\n\nI didn't see any mention of wells.  But to give you an idea of what to expect, our original well was 40 feet deep.  This well was perfectly good until we expanded the dairy herd beyond its capacity.  The next well was drilled 170 feet deep and the water was crisp and delicious.\n\nAnyways, hope some of this help or confirms what you already know.  Its just amazing they still haven't replaced that Stillwater bridge. Anyways, real nice plot you got there!",

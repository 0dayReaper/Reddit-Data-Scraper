I do this around being dad to my 4 year old . I have like six greenhouses within 10 minutes of me not counting big box stores. However nobody grows what I grow. I get requests from out of state I'm just not set up to do it at my scale. The funny thing is I say there can be a me and every town my customers are within a 10 mile radius of my house for the most part unless I go to an event. The only way I make money is by doing things DIY and being very very wise with my space my sales tactics. It's definitely not as simple as grow the plants and they will sell. My challenge is everything takes twice the amount of Labor because I'm so space constrained but shoot if you have the ability to throw up a three season 40 ft long greenhouse and create your market , I think you could do quite well if you're in a high enough income area. Pardon any spelling or punctuation this is voice texted got to go give kiddo a bath but I'll be happy to answer any questions",

And 20 bucks an hour is amazing, considering most people make much much less for minimum wage. Any tips and advice you can give would be so so appreciated!!",

My logic was that peppers and tomatoes are the best selling plants locally. Makes it easier for me because they require similar timing and conditions. I figured if I could take the 2 things people love and offer well researched , quality heirlooms from vendors that share my values , I could offer dozens of varieties of peppers and tomatoes. Then as I can expand outside in my greenhouse (northern climate) I add cucumbers because everyone loves pickles. Then due to being a one man show I go out and sell. Mix of pop up plant sales and fairs. A surprising amount of pre orders this year. I have definitely had some bumps in the road and wouldnt say im living the dream but I think I've proved my model is successful. Even if a big greenhouse takes my model I think I'll be successful because the people who buy from me buy for my knowledge hard work and clean plants.",

I need to half pepper volume and dedicate that half to cherry tomatoes alone. I was unprepared for the volume. I almost sold out in pre orders which left me in awkward positions for the plant sales.\n\nWhat do you like to do with them?

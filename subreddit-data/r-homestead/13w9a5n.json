    "postText": "We planted 6 trees 2 years ago and never amended the soil, pruned them, or watered them much except the first few months after planting.  \n\nWould like to correct some of that now, but not sure where to start.  Last year, only 2 of the 6 trees grew leafs and we thought the others were not going to make it, but to our surprise this year all have regrown leafs and I have been watering them deeply once per week.  \n\nThe ground is pretty silty they are in and not very nutrient dense.  I have a good amount of well aged compost on hand and some north country organic pro grow dry fertilizer.  Should I just apply a fair dose of that mixed with compost and try to scatter around the existing trees?  Would it be more beneficial to dig up the trees, reammend the holes with better dirt and replant?\n\nAlso what to do about pruning.  Can I just cut the trees in half pretty much?  To be clear I have since read about the proper ways to prune an apple tree and understand the basics, but I dont understand how to correct my already stretched out/lanky trees with minimal branching,  If it is okay in that aspect to chop them down from 4-6' down to 2-3'??",

They've spent years building these beautiful networks of roots all over the surrounding soil and you think it'd be good for them to cut up all that just to hurry down some compost that the worms would have carried to the roots from the surface if you'd just put the compost down and left it alone? \n\nTop dress compost around the drip line of each tree. No pruning till after these leaves currently on them have fallen off on their own.  \n\nThis summer you get to watch their shapes and think about which branches you're hoping to cut when you prune. Look up any book or guide on pruning for diagrams on what looks good vs bad. You want to shape the tree so it'll grow strong over time, remembering that every limb gets a bit bigger in circumference every year for as long as it lives. Just like picking baby names that will also be respectable on an adult, you're picking a shape for the scraggly adolescent tree that also needs to suit the stockier, mature tree a decade or two later. \n\nIf you mess up and prune something you didn't mean to, don't despair! If that spot seemed to it like a good place to grow a limb once, the tree will probably try to make another limb around there again in the future.",

Because roughly the first 7 years pruning isn't a thing like when they begin to produce.\n\nYou can top them in the pruning season, and remove suckers (straight up growth that generally isn't fruit producing, but does bear some fruit.)\n\nBut that first several years, any cutting or pruning is more like bonsai tree sculpting. Taking off as minimally as possible and shaping some for production.",

The only reason I really want to prune them is because of how lanky they are.  \n\nTwo of them particularly are about 6' tall now, but all the branches are at the very top foot.  Seems like they should have some main branches way down lower on the plant?",

Cut off a limb and graft another limb onto it of a similar type and the tree just rolls with it. But  if the original is a dwarf, and you've grafted on a full size, that graft may be full size and shear off due to weight of left unchecked, or may grow to a medium size to graft and cultivate something new, or start being a dwarf size. It all depends and when raising commercially, 9 times out of 10 they got it figured out and right.\n\nSo I don't know where I am confusing you but hopefully this is helping to answer what I think you're asking about now with root stock and grafting.",

I would like to eventually have some animals and have a large garden. \n\nI know its hard to tell from the video but do you think its usable land? Can i put a ditch on the side to help with drainage? Should i avoid it and wait for something that is dryer?\n\nWhat should some idea to put for conditions?",

Ideally you'd want photos of the site in every season to take an accurate guess at how the water table behaves. \n\n5 acres is small enough where decisions made by your neighbors upstream and downstream will have a huge impact on how water behaves on your land, too. \n\nIf you want 5 acres of space that's usable for farming and/or building year-round, don't by 5 acres that's half swamp.",

Ive gone to look at a number of places that were basically high taxed wetlands. Those properties are not a good buy for homesteading. Unless you buy with an understanding of what you\u2019re useable acreage is and chock up the wetland acreage to wildlife enjoyment and a buffer to other properties. Don\u2019t do anything silly like trying to conquer a wetland for agriculture. You\u2019ll commit environmental atrocities beyond your comprehension without very good reason.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve spent some serious time studying water geographies and wetland biology, you should assume that they are far more sensitive and far more vital to the environment we all depend on than you realize. This is generally the truth people should live by. Wetlands slow the flow of water to the ocean and clean that water. They reduce erosion from the land and capture carbon from the atmosphere much faster than dry lands. They provide animals (including us) with drinking water.",

Some places have strict regulations, others not so much.  Plus you never know, could be food plain from that ditch to the east that creeps onto the property. The county would have records. I would also have a company come out to test the soils and see where a septic system would be suitable. I don't believe you could cut in a ditch because you would need somewhere for that water to drain.  It's not legal to force water onto other properties.",

Literally, they will cite you if you have 6 goats on 5 acres. It\u2019s absurd and I hate it. \n   Check your local Ag laws before you make big plans like I did. Colorado you can have a lot of goats per acre. Much of north GA- it\u2019s only 1 per acre. It makes it hard to do anything with livestock here, which Im beginning to think is their goal. \ud83d\ude12",

So I get why counties want to become \"organized\" and create regulations, but in your case that's a bit extreme.  My county is more extreme with buildings or any type of structures that go up instead of worrying about livestock. They will not approve anything to be built within 40' of your property line if it is next to an ag field. This is to make the farmers happy and not have to worry about over spraying or hitting anything with their equipment, which is bullshit imo.",

They can usually pull your lot up on the computer and print out a USGS and see if your land is in a flood plane. The Local surveyor will be your best source of information. Some counties have an elected surveyor position, so it might not cost anything.",

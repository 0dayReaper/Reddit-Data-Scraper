    "postText": "So I didn\u2019t react well to finding out about grazon after two years of composting my goats manure and putting it in my (large amount of expensive) plants. I get hay from my neighbor who just mentioned that the goat poop might kill my plants because of the grazon. This, in a community of farmers, who all compost and grow their own food. \n\nI haven\u2019t had any issues until recently, with my tomato plants. I\u2019m suspicious and angry and have no idea what to do.\n\nDoes everyone use grazon? Is organic hay a thing? Should I just start making my own? What am I supposed to be able to compost? WHAT DO I DO WITH ALL THIS MANURE!?!",

Hay cut from vegetation which has been treated with Grazon XC Herbicide should not be used for composting or mulching, nor should the manure from animals ingesting treated grass or hay be used around susceptible plants, because picloram residues pass through the animal unchanged and are still herbicidally active. Contact Corteva Agriscience Canada Company for additional information on sensitive broadleaf plant species.\nOn areas treated with this product, do not rotate to crops intended for food or feed use, other than range or pasture grasses, wheat, barley or oats not underseeded with a legume, do not move treated soil, or use treated soil for growing other plants until soil residues of picloram are no longer detectable as indicated by an adequately sensitive bioassay or chemical test.",

    "postText": "We are looking at some land in the Southern United States. There is a lot of iron on the ground. I know some iron is needed for many crops/plants, and that red dirt is generally good to grow in, but wondered if that might be too much iron in the soil? \n\nThe trees seem large and healthy for the area and the grasses and landscaping plants seem healthy but just wanted to ask if that would be of concern for growing most plants/crops seen in the Southern US. Interested in most veggies but also tomatoes, and especially blueberries/blackberries.\n\nThere are rock sized peaces of iron and occasional larger stones about 10-20lbs in the rockier areas and around creek.",

            "comment": "We call it red clay but it is technically a clay loam.  Red clay doesn't have too much iron for plants.  Most of the iron is FeO3 and plants use Fe02.  I would prefer red clay over any other color of clay, and over most of the sandy soil I have seen.   Produce grown in red clay often tastes better than produce grown in the sand.  And may be healthier too.  Look at the distribution of dairies in the south.  Plenty of dairies on red clay and very few on sandy soil.  Sandy ground won't support the cows well enough.",

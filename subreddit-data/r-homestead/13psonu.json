Cows seem to avoid the grass once it gets tall, and from what I've read the most nutrition is in the grass while it's fresh growth and in the shorter stage of it's growing cycle. So I'm curious if there would be any benefit to letting a couple pastures grow tall before the winter as standing hay, or if there's not enough nutrition to make it worthwhile.",

They normally don't give it enough time to go to seed, but the grass is definitely higher than optimum.  They normally turn the cows in mid October so they finish up by the end of November.  Still have to plan for hay during the winter.  These are mature cows who don't need optimum nutrition all the time.",

I don't have a tractor and have been thinking about letting several of the pastures grow to turn in to standing hay in the fall in hopes of decreasing hay costs over winter. Pasture is mostly fescue with clover mixed in. I currently mow pastures periodically to keep the grass from turning into thick stalks - the cows seem to enjoy the new growth grass and avoid it once it's tall and seeded. I'm wondering if they'd maintain weight eating what remains of the tall stuff in the winter once there's less new growth to feast on.\n\n\nDoes anyone let their pastures grow tall in the fall to decrease the amount of hay they need over winter? Anything to be aware of?",

Our temperate climate might be different to yours though. Also we sometimes shut up excess grass in the spring and feed it off through the summer drought, although that\u2019s only poor quality rough feed suitable as a maintenance ration for mature animals.\n\nLittle calves like in the picture need good quality food to grow. If they have to eat hay or rough pasture they\u2019d need calf pellets to boost the protein and energy of their diet. But as a grass (not lucerne) hay substitute rough saved pasture might be OK.",

Some may say they rotate etc but you'd get that maybe one year before your pasture fell apart. Your best bet on that much land is to rotate them and graze as long as possible and buy hay or sell before winter. Some feed lots will feed through winter for you at a monthly rate. Or try and buy feed from a neighbour. Or sell them or process in late September",

And based on your question I highly doubt you have optimal fencing to pull that off. Also considering the type of calves in the pic. They need a lot of grain if you're gonna eat them. Particularly that Holstein. It will do terribly on grass alone if you're treating this as a beef animal. I'd also stop feeding it squatted like that. It's a poor head position to bottle fed. He's also going to knock you on your ass in no time when he butts the bottle",

I respect that you've had different experiences, from your profile it looks like you're in Canada, and I'm in the south eastern US (long growing seasons, lots of rain, lots of sunny days). You're off on pretty much all the assertions though.\n\nWhile I'm sure Canada is very different, two young steers only put a dent on 4 acres of quality pasture in the southeast. I grew up cussing my dad's cows for not eating more cuz I was always out on the bush hog keeping the pastures from overgrowing. Their second year of life they start eating a lot more, but calves just not big enough to keep up with 2 acres of pasture a piece in this part of the world.\n\nI'm not sure how you surmised that our fencing is bad (?) but it's in great shape and well laid out for rotational grazing/resting a pasture or two in order for the grass to grow tall.\n\nWe've raised Holsteins in the past and had great luck with them. I was honestly pretty surprised with how good the meat was considering that they're a dairy breed. Ours have done very well grass fed/finished. Obviously anything grass fed isn't gonna gain weight as fast as beef that's grainfed, and a Holstein isn't gonna put on as much meet as quickly as a beef breed, but that's a non-issue for us raising a little meat for the family\n\nI'm neither of the three folks pictured here and the calves are now weaned. While it's not typically how I bottle fed them, no one was knocked on their bottom in the process of this feeding \ud83d\ude09.\n\nRegardless, thanks for your input, and happy farming!",

I raise Holsteins now. They need much different feed. They will be bone racks on grass alone. It's such a early starter question so that's why I assume you didn't have proper set up. You and again stated what I said, it will only last through those cows. You must rest it after or it will stop working out for you. Which was my first statement. The land will need a seasons break and some good maintenance. And about the squatting. It's just a bad way to feed a bottle calf. It's not good for it's health or yours. \n\n\u270c\ufe0f",

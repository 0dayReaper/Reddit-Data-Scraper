    "postText": "I've worked in customer service for 12 years now and it has been taxing, to say the least. It started off in-office but since the pandemic I've been working from home. Three years ago my wife and I bought 5.25 acres nearby and I've been slowly building a homestead. It'll be some time until we live there, but for now its only a 10 minute commute away from our apartment. Recently I found a local organic vegetable farm that neighbors our homestead, and just accepted a position there as an assistant farmer. I'll be getting paid less to do more work, but I couldn't be happier to get out from in front of a computer and regain some sanity. I've learned a lot in the past 3 years, but to progress I believe I need to spend some time on a proper farm. Farming does not run in my family and they don't really understand my choices, but most of my friends do and perhaps some of you will too.   \n\n\nOn paper my work-from-home gig was ideal. It occasionally gave me the freedom to spend extra time working outside. Recently though with some management changes there's been an increase in micromanagement, a push for more sales, and much less accountability. I've never really enjoyed the job, but it has been especially bad the past few months. WFH jobs can be great for homesteading, but 8 hours at a desk is 8 hours at a desk, and it takes its toll. Its bittersweet having held the job for long and having witnessed the transition from hip start-up to corporate hellscape, but so it goes. I've been dreaming of this day for about 10 out of those 12 years and just wanted to share. Thank you for reading.  \n\n\nPS: I will need off-season work. I'm a writer so I can do some freelance work in the motorcycle industry still, but would likely need something more regular Nov.-May. I'm located in Berks County, PA. Any ideers?",

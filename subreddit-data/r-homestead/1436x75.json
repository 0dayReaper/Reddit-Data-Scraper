            "comment": "It really depends what you're doing with that land. What pasture will you have on it? How much fertiliser and herbicides are you using? Will the soil pug over winter needing cultivation and resowing in the spring? Are you mucking out the poo, or spreading it on the pasture? Are you wanting the horses to be fed exclusively from the land, or are you going to buy in feed?",

Thank you for the reply!\n\nI want to grow Kentucky bluegrass, I don\u2019t really want to use too many chemicals tbh but I suppose once we do obtain the land and start growing we\u2019d need a soil test done and base our decisions then. The horses would be fed mostly from grazing on the land but I\u2019ll also keep hay. \n\nIs 5 acres also enough to include 1-2 cows, 2 goats, and some chickens?",

            "comment": "As someone said, to have enough to graze if that's how you're going to feed them, you need two acres per horse on average. About the same for a full size cow. So 5 acres could be plenty for two horses, 4 acres of pasture and an acre for house/etc if you have buildings and it's not just all pasture for the horses. You could probably also could fit a couple small/mini cows, a couple goats, and chickens on all 5 but it might start to get tight for the pasture.  Goats are browsers more than grazers so they won't eat as much grass as the other animals. \n\nI have 3 acres, including the house and all buildings. I don't have have pasture, I have a good sized dry lot with a run in \"barn\" and 2 horses and it's enough space. I do have to buy hay all year because I have no pasture. Definitely rotate your pasture to get the most out of it.",

            "comment": "Yes that\u2019s plenty. Typically you need two acres for one horse and an acre for each additional horse. 5 acres will be plenty and depending on breeds of cow and their purpose that\u2019s enough for a couple of cows and goats as well. Chickens can hang with the other animals or go into their own coop and run. The big thing will be managing grazing ground and providing ample hay if you don\u2019t have the pasture they all need to graze.",

In the US there\u2019s a website called the web soul survey (I\u2019m not sure of the exact address, but type those words in and you\u2019ll find it) that will give you all that info, I don\u2019t know other countries though.\n\n    - Do you want them out 24/7?  Even if they\u2019re not really hungry, horses are going to graze.\n\n    - Will you be supplementally feeding with hay +/or grain?\n\n    - Are you willing to subdivide pastures so you can control just where your horses are grazing, or would you rather keep one large pasture?\n\nEdited because my bullet points didn\u2019t format lol",

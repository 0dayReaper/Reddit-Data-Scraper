    "postText": "Last year my neighbor approached me saying that he had a deal worked out with Verizon to put a cell tower at the edge of his property, which would be a stones-throw from my house. With dollar signs in his eyes, he said they\u2019d be contacting me to run conduit through my land. I said I\u2019d be happy to take a look at their plans and consider a financial offer. \n\n\n3 weeks later I\u2019m contacted, saying everything is ready to go and they have a notary ready to come to my home for signatures. No plans sent, no offer, just a, \u201cHey! We\u2019re ready to go!\u201d \n\n\nSo I call and ask for some sort of blueprints/scope of work for the cell tower and mention I\u2019d like to talk financial compensation. I\u2019m sent the plans and they had 1/5 of my 2 acres blocked off for a utility easement, I wouldn\u2019t be able to build on or farm the land. With the possibility of a pay off, I keep my composure and ask them to make me an offer\u2026. $800 one-time payment is what they come back with. \n\nThey would\u2019ve cut down multiple 100+ year old tulip poplars. Paved into a forest to add a cell tower and maintenance building, cutting off my only view that is strictly nature; I live in front of a busy 2-lane highway. I was lucky enough to find this land in a developing popular area and already have 50 apples trees planted w/ a large garden. \n\n\nMy next reply was along the lines of, \u201cthis land is worth far more than $800, if this cell tower is to be run through my land, I will need a full Scope of Work, materials list, men &amp; equipment needed, and I\u2019ll need your estimates of how long the project will take + 6 months because I know it\u2019ll take longer than planned. Finally, if a leased payment plan is out of the question, I can\u2019t settle for less than a $120,000 one time payment\u201d. \n\nThey haven\u2019t contacted me since and my neighbor doesn\u2019t wave as much when he drives by. The 4 other families around me are very happy that no cell tower will be going in. \n\nI should clarify that my neighbor told me that they\u2019d be paying him annually for the next decade, where they offered me pennies.\n\nEDIT: Thank y\u2019all! This post has really validated my decision. I figured I was getting screwed, but also hate stepping on toes. Hope this can help others, love y\u2019all!",

The companies had to have contracts for enough tower locations to create a viable network, so there were a lot of them scouting for locations.\n\nThe company offered me $5000 a month to lease one acre of property. An added benefit would be that I would also get a free cell phone and the best internet connection available. At the time I was on dial up on the phone line that ran down the dirt road in front of our house. The phone line was bad, internet worse, probably because at one curve, the line came up out of a mud puddle where it was duct taped to a stick to keep the splice out of the water.\n\nUnfortunately, that company didn't win the FCC bid for this area. Instead, the local cell tower is about a half mile south, on the west side of a ridge that blocks the cell signals to the east. Our property is on that ridge so would have provided better coverage. The nearest tower to our east is ten miles away, leaving a huge blank area of no coverage just ten miles from the state capital.\n\nNow, I'm just as happy that they didn't get the license and that I didn't let a tower be built here - but my life would have been a lot easier if it had happened. $5000 a month is a nice sum to think about.",

Due to future planned road widening about a mile of 25\u2019 wide easement had to be cleared. Second day the clearing crew calls and ask me to come out as there is \u201ca dude with a shotgun.\u201d Stopping the work. When I get there there was this huge dude with a rebel flag t-shirt, cut-off jeans and a shotgun over his shoulder leaning against a tree. I walk up to him, introduce myself, hands him my business card and ask him that the problem seems to be. \nShotgun dude: This is my land, y\u2019all can\u2019t come onto it!\nMe: sir, this area is an easement (show him the signed and sealed plans clearly indicating the easement)\nshotgun dude: Dunno about that but this is my land and y\u2019all can\u2019t go on it! \n\nSo I thanked him and walked away. Called the project owners and explained the situation. \nAbout 45 minutes later the site is full of suits and police officers. They all go over to talk to shotgun dude whom now has a buddy with him. \n\nAfter a while they come back and issue me a work stop order.  Turns out that the DOT thought they had bought the easement when in fact the shotgun dude never had sold it. Something the guys buddy and lawyer was quick to prove. \n\nTwo weeks later we could resume the project. \nDon\u2019t know what they payed for the easement but I hope you made out good shotgun dude!",

The county had plans drawn up and was briefing at a planning meeting without even contacting me. I had a neighbor ask about it and told him I had no info. He sent me details on the meeting and a link to the plans. I did some research on lifting stations, including size, noise, odor, and maintenance and realized very quickly this would not be nice for me. According to their plans it would be about 100 yards from my bedroom window.\nI went to the next meeting and when they briefed they asked for questions. I raised my hand and asked if the property owners were contacted yet. A bit of stuttering answer said they were in process of working with the property owners. I pointed out the land on their plan was mine and we could talk after the meeting. I suggested a dollar amount, reoccurring yearly for the usage and access, also pointing out the plans had the lines going through my septic and would need to hook into the system which I wanted exemption from any fees. He said they would consider it and let me know. I never heard from them again but my land wasn't on their next briefing.\n\nKudos to you op!",

I feel like this is what's going to happen with OP if he remains firm and gets a good lawyer. He could easily get a million or more out of this if he plays his cards right and they're insistent on putting the tower there. Then he could sell and buy all the land he wants if his heart desires. A million is a drop in the bucket for a megacorporation like Verizon. Offering him $800 is downright insulting.",

NIMBYs basically just drag it out by any means necessary until the project doesn't make financial sense and it gets moved/canceled.  For example, my town has renewable energy goals (to make us more resilient and self-sufficient long term), but any time a company tries to put in a solar farm, neighbors complain because don't want to see it on their drive home.  They launch a million stupid lawsuits or demand ridiculous concessions until the legal and regulatory costs exceed the profitability of the project. \n\nThere are absolutely legitimate concerns with viewsheds and land access easements (as in OPs case) where people need to be compensated, but we have to be fair about it to both parties so that the public's needs can be met.",

Well, generally that law was created specifically for the federal government for things like creating roads, highways, railways, bridges, and hospitals through or on private property---but that was long before  we had things like cellphones and WIFI (1876 was when eminent domain was ratified).   \n\n\nSo the problem here is that the federal government has no company like the DOT, so private companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon fill this void by providing the wireless infrastructure that we all rely on and need as a society and is partly subsidized by the federal government. So in the case of mobile phone tower installation, local governments have no control or power over where these towers can be placed as that power is solely under the federal government's jurisdiction.",

It\u2019s at the top of a large hill, but the tower is in the shape of an artificial spruce tree and if you didn\u2019t know any better, you\u2019d never even notice the cell tower hiding among the rest of the trees.\n\nThey paid us $200k to put it in. \n\nOP you were being utterly and totally insulted to the point where it\u2019s unbelievable. If it were $800 *per month* for the next 20 years, that would almost be fair.",

Verizon approached them and offered them $2000 per month for the next 25 years to allow them to install a cell phone tower on their property. His mother was all for it, but her husband wasn't going to have to \"look at this cell tower for the rest of his life\", so they refused the offer. Well about 3 months later Bart's parents came driving up to there home to see Verizon and their contractors erecting a cell phone tower on their next door neighbor's property. So, not only did they not get paid, they have to \"look at this cell tower for the rest of his life\". Bummer.",

So they get $500/mo forever for owning a tiny piece of land that isn't worth much. If you're moving and don't have to look at it, it's the best deal ever. Luckily I have 10 acres, so it's not that much of a bother. But they also allowed 2 gas wells to be installed on the property, which consume about 2 acres and the pipeline prevents building on a lot more. I've been poor and I get it. But allowing your land to be permanently destroyed for money is never, ever the right move.",

He doesn't get along too well with her and doesn't care for the tower at all. One time before I moved in, he says he caught the tower guys on his property and confronted them. They said they were about to cut his fence and bring a crane in. Without even asking. He had the sheriff come remove them. They couldn't put the crane on my side because it was thick with brush. I'm guessing they had to block the road and set it up there. I tend to agree with him. They pay a near-fortune for the tiny piece of land, but have no arrangement for crane space? That's on them. Not his problem (or mine now).",

My final project before leaving was an ATT cell tower that was going in to replace an older tower in a different part of the campus. The way the cell companies do this shit is insane. They hired a construction company, who had convinced the school to put this in. ATT provided the material, but everything else was subcontracted to this firm nobody had ever heard of, and I now know had almost zero experience. We had almost no contact with anybody at ATT, while this fly by night construction company was doing everything wrong. I\u2019m pretty sure the random contractor finds a need, tells ATT they can do the job for say $5 mil. They offer the property owner $250k, and it seems like everyone is happy. The contractor has not done his homework, and the deal falls through when unforeseen (completely reasonable) issues arise. In our case they wanted to trench a direct line from the service station to the new tower, which would require trenching through a geothermal well and a baseball field. They said they would repair the field to which I gave them a quote of close to 1 million dollars. They wanted to do the work during the season and I told them they would be on the hook for renting a similar field which they had not planned. All in all, these clowns sold ATT a bill of goods for a way too good to be true price, and it fell apart. I\u2019m sure the same thing happened here with your situation. Good on you for putting a stop to it, and fuck your neighbor for not realizing his payday was at your expense.",

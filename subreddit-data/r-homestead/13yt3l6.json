    "postText": "My Fathers neighbors are trying to sell their 13 acres of property, with a cell tower on it, to him as the property is connected to his land. However, they are telling us that they are not paid monthly or have a lease with the cell company and that the company has lifetime access to the property; to make changes to a chunk of the property, the road leading up to it, etc. Essentially telling us that if he buys the property he won\u2019t really be compensated for the tower on it.\n\nIs that even a thing? A lifetime access to the property without paying taxes or a rent to have the tower on there. Seems crazy and definitely lowers the value in our eyes.",

I come only with my lowball-ish offer in twenty dollar bills cash and just show it to them and say \u201cthis is what I\u2019ve got\u201d and 7/10 take it when they see the green. Way easier than haggling. It literally releases dopamine for people to see cash making them more agreeable.",

Depending on the geography and how your parcels are laid out, I\u2019d buy it anyways just so that I don\u2019t get any dumb people buying it and building next to me. Something like that would scare away most buys so I\u2019d be pessimistic that whoever did buy it would be bad neighbors. Use the tower to negotiate a killer price if you can and rest sound knowing some crazy guy isn\u2019t gonna move in next door.",

Verizon and AT&amp;T used to own many of their own towers but have since sold most to larger REITs. Usually a real estate company like American Tower, Crown Castle, Everest, etc will own the structure itself and pay the property owner a flat monthly/annual fee for access and rights to the tower. Access will include an right of way and utility easement and typically gives any carriers leased there 24 hours access so they can get to their equipment if there are issues. \n\nI'd suggest finding out who owns the tower by searching the address or coordinates on the FCC website to see who the structure is registered to. Then reach out to the tower owner and see if you can get information on the underlying \"ground lease\" which would be the agreement with the land owner to have the tower there.",

I\u2019m going through setting up an easement for a power line and a electric tower on my property. These things are very detailed. You need to watch the wording very carefully. We had to have three changes made to ours. The easement gave them the right to access the site and build a road if necessary. We had to add a stipulation as to where they could put the road. The way it was originally worded they could have put the road anywhere they wanted. \n\nYou definitely need to see the legal documents. You may even want a layer to look at them. The company we are dealing with paid for us to go to a layer of our choice. He pointed out a few things we didn\u2019t see or understand. One being a mistake on the size of the easement.",

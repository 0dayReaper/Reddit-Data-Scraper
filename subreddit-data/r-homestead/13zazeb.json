One was looking to get cameras into their greenhouses in 2020 with the added benefit of getting WiFi out there for their trimmers.  I gave them a roll of cable that I had in my truck and told them that once they had it run I would come out and terminate and test it.  My on-site time took less than 30 minutes and I told them that it was free including the cable.  It was taking up space in my truck and I was happy to help a friend.  I came away with 7 Kg 50% pork trim for making sausage, 2 L of raw milk cream for ice cream, and 30g of very nice cannabis.  I've since done some processing for them so it's not at all unusual for me to come away from their house with up to a kilo in my van.  They're always on my list in maple syrup season.",

Hurtful language about body image can have significant negative impacts on an individual's mental health and self-esteem. It may also be triggering. When someone is subjected to derogatory comments about their appearance, they may begin to feel ashamed or embarrassed about their body, leading to feelings of low self-worth and poor body image. This can result in harmful behaviors such as disordered eating or excessive exercising to change their body in an attempt to conform to societal beauty standards. Moreover, hurtful language about body image can also contribute to the development of anxiety and depression, leading to long-term consequences on an individual's mental health. Therefore, it is crucial to promote body positivity and refrain from making negative comments about someone's appearance.

    "postText": "Not really sure where to post this, so I thought I'd try here. We picked up a couple barn kittens late last summer, and all was going well. In the fall, we had a stray wander into our yard, and it was being pretty aggressive. He moved on, but he's made his way back this spring. He's been around for about a month now, and I don't think he's going anywhere. He and our female seem to tolerate each other, but he clearly has an issue with our male. They've had a few standoffs and he's chased our male up trees multiple times. \n\nWe haven't seen our male for over a week now, and I'm wondering if that stray could have scared him off the property. I'm assuming either that happened, or a predator got him. We don't really have much for predators around here though, so I'm assumimg it's the former. It's a little sad because my dog really enjoyed playing with him, so I'm just wondering if there's any chance he'll be back.",

I've never been able to get within 20 feet before he bolts, but I've heard from neighbors that he kind of comes and goes from farmstead to farmstead. They've nicknamed him Roamer.\n\nEdit: I'm honestly tempted to just try to domesticate him. There's no guarantee my other cat will come back, and he's been eating the food I leave out for the other one. He seems content to stick around, though it would be nice for the other cat to have a companion. They seem to get along, but I don't see them socializing like my other two did.",

(I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re US based and I understand it can be done for free, and they also vaccinate against rabies.) As long as he\u2019s neutered the cats should get along OK, being outside with plenty of space.",

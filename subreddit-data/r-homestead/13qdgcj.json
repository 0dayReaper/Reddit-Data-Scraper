Paid cash with some money my mother left me when she passed.\n\nI think Cali is a great place to visit but I would never try to homestead there.  It's just so overly bureaucratic and over taxed.  And the only places land is \"cheap\" is where wildfires have already destroyed everything.  From what I've been told, in those areas, home insurance will cost you more than the mortgage payment.\n\nHomesteading on a budget can be done.  But it would take WAY more research than I'd be willing to put in to find a part of cali that's affordable, sane, buildable, has reliable water, and isn't overly regulated.... IF such a place even exists in the state it would take me months to narrow down where to even begin looking.\n\nWe got land in a state where it's cheap and regulations allow for earthships and earthbags and whatnot.  Cali is great for those with the money and patience but on a budget and building ourselves, it was never even on the list for us.",

There are some lenders that specialize in rural lending, and they have better interest rates than traditional mortgage lenders. AgWest Farm Credit Services is one on the west coast.\n\nYou can try to find land with owner financing, which may make it less expensive (my brother bought 5 acres this way). \n\nAs far as finding land? I found mine the same way you find a house: real estate listings in various places.  \n\nYou can also drive around to find places you think you'd like. Then look up the property at the county website (usually the county  appraiser or assessor) to find the owner and contact info for the owner. Then contact the owner to see if they are interested in selling to you.",

USDA  homes usually end up being older and not in great/new shape so you have to look around. The state financing put 5000 down for us and nothing out of pocket. \n\nDue to Cali being Cali things may still be expensive and this may be a pipe dream there.",

    "postText": "Hi. It's my first time buying a rural property, and I'm getting a bit confused about the water situation. This house has a drilled well and a spring source. Both of the sources flow into the house. From everything I've seen online, that's extremely unusual and was probably unnecessary, but okay.\n\nMy concern is on the water testing. For inside the house, we of course want the water to be drinkable. At the recommendation of some local experts, they advised to do a mineral test in addition to the normal bacteria test, which found super high levels (10x EPA recommended levles) of iron and 15x recommended levels of TDS. Our expert says that usually means we should do the more expensive full spectrum heavy metal test and will almost certainly need a reverse osmosis system. The expert also said because spring water is coming in and also part of the home system, there's almost always bacteria contamination, which would need to be addressed.\n\nThe sellers are pitching a hissy fit at our test results and basically accused us of lying about the results, so we've agreed to a second test to verify. They're requesting that we only test the water directly in the well and not a flow point like the kitchen, where we also gathered results.\n\nMy question is... Is that or any of this normal? I kind of feel like testing only the well wouldn't change the problem that the water at the faucet still isn't drinkable based on the tests, especially with two sources flowing into the house. But not being familiar with rural buying, I thought I'd ask this group if you've seen or heard of anything like this before.\n\n(Also, the sellers have a Poland spring 5 gallon dispenser in the kitchen, which increases my suspicion that they know the water needs extra treatment and don't want to disclose it or negotiate that point with us.)",

That way you know what's showing up as bad well water and what's showing up as contaminated lines or pipes.  You're less likely to have expensive surprises if you know what to expect.\n\nAnd get the spring water tested too.  Even if you just use it to water the dogs or livestock, you need it to be safe.",

The iron and TDS would necessitate the installation of a ion exchange water softener to treat the water before trying to put it through the RO.  Otherwise, the membrane would be quickly destroyed.  Water passing through an RO should also first have any bacteria killed with chems or UV.  Yes, the faucet should be sterilized with heat or hydrogen peroxide before the sample is taken.  Sometimes wells can be cured by shocking the well head with chlorox.  By all means use this as a negotiating tool, but it's not a show stopper.  Worst case scenario, you can have great water for a few thousand dollars.  I hope this helps.",

So not many folks but people sprayed DDT way back in the day so who knows ha.\n\nA few hours away is a college and they seem to have a boil water notice every few weeks. The school has it own treatment center but is designed to small or atleast was designed for average hourly flow vs poop before a test flow ha. It flowers to the towns treatment system but seems like atleast once or twice a month they have a boil water notice due to them both being maxed out and having to release stuff early.\n\nNot sure of the numbers but say like 5-7k people live on the campus but folks commuting to college might be like 15k+ a day. So you get tons of folks come in after a decent to long drive to take a big test and a whole lot of flushing done at once ha.\n\nHope it is so large everything dilutes very well and the are filtering better then they do around here",

How much is it going to cost you in the long run to make that water potable?  Are they willing to credit you that amount below asking?  Or are you willing to just pay for whatever system might fix it?  Or just buy filtered water for as long as you live there?  I would figure out what would make this right for you and propose that to them.  Because just testing at the well isn't going to make you feel secure in the quality of that water.  Might as well get a reading at the Tap again.  Though perhaps you could give them the chance to give the faucet a proper clean and purge before testing just in case the faucet is the source of the bacteria?",

Also if you do end up doing a whole home treatment system that treats for bacteria, iron, hardness, heavy metals etc that can end up being in the $20K range.  If you are thinking of going that route I recommend you take the water sample data and get a quote on the system you want just to verify.",

            "comment": "It's worthwhile to test at both locations IMO.  \n\nIf pipes are contaminated, it can be fixed (generally pretty easily).  What the well is providing you with is harder, but also not very difficult necessarily, to deal with.\n\nYou don't necessarily need RO, although a lot of people like it for drinking water.\n\nUsually you'll end up needing a softener to remove the minerals, including iron, and probably something to deal with bacteria.  This can be chlorine or peroxide treatment, UV light, etc.  There's all in one whole house filters as well that remove smells, bacteria, etc.  \n\nOften, companies who do that will also provide an RO for the sink you can use for drinking water.\n\nPersonally, I changed out my chlorine system because it was a pain in the ass.  You have to refill periodically, the pumps go bad, sometimes it can't keep up with usage, etc.  So I now have all-in-one, plus a softener and a UV treat at the end.  Much less hassle.\n\nI wouldn't call any of the water issues a deal breaker if you have good flow, but its good to know what you're getting into.  People are weird about water, they may or may not have known, but being told you've been drinking \"bad\" water for years can make people distrust results.",

Our lawyer also lives up there (also in his 70s) and has the opinion that water is water, so that doesn't help a ton either. \n\nI just don't want to get stuck with thousands of dollars of water costs.

If so, how? \n\nWe have 2 wells, one is shallow and has a lot of groundwater infiltration and sediment which means lots of filtering and bacteria. \n\nThe second is deep and provides us with our \"house\" water. Once the first started failing and having issues we had the second drilled and separated the pipes so the old one is just for irrigation and non-potable use. I wouldn't trust spring water for drinking unless it was heavily filtered and run through a UV system as well to get rid of bacteria. \n\nSounds like you could have the best of both worlds with a proper filtration system. Yes they can get ridiculously expensive, but shop around and get multiple quotes. The first filter guy we talked to was literally twice the cost of the second, and was selling us the exact same product... saved 2k there! Now I change a filter and uv bulb every 6 months and that's the extent of my dealings with it.",

It sounds like you need a few filters....1st a big sediment filter, followed by a chlorine injection ( or ozone ) to kill bacteria and oxidize the iron, a activated charcoal to remove the chlorine, then a iron filter. The parts are going to run you about 2k. If you have someone put it in for you, it could be 5k.\n\nDo a full water test looking for lead and arsenic and anything else in a standard full test.

            "comment": "Get the full test done. See if you can isolate the sources, like pull your well sample directly from the well, and the spring directly from the spring before it goes into a holding tank. How's this plumbing rigged up? Like, do both spring and well flow into the same tank? Do they both use the same diaphragm tank (metal pressure tank with the switch for the pump)? That would create a situation where you'd need to clean out the whole system if one of the two sources is the problem.\n\nWhere I live, springs often, very often, carry giardia seasonally. Anyone lucky enough to have one uses UV if not RO. Also, a lot of people have very high iron and sulpher in their wells. Everyone around here has pretty sturdy filtration systems, and once again possibly RO. \n\nBut some of the older folks, who have been drinking it their whole lives, don't bother and swear by it as healthy water. Idk, but I'm personally not gonna get kidney stones finding out. Tastes better filtered. A sediment and charcoal pair takes care of the bulk of the iron and sulpher.",

You will absolutely need to filter/treat that. You\u2019ll also probably need to flush and sterilize the pipes in your house\u2026 you\u2019ll have growth in there. Now that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing\u2026 it just might be tho. Odds are there\u2019s an unused tap or a dead end in the pipes in that house that\u2019s gonna have a bunch of stinky goo in it. Even after flushing it I\u2019d suggest chlorine tablets in your water for 6 months or so, and after that yearly treatments for the life of the house (don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s super cheap). Citric acid flushes work well too, if you don\u2019t overdo it on the copper. \n\nFrankly, I have no idea why your first tester didn\u2019t do a heavy metal test. That\u2019s a standard part of all water tests. I wouldn\u2019t trust that guy either. \n\nThe iron\u2026 yes, that\u2019s an indicator of possible heavy metals. An old well should not be producing iron\u2026 that\u2019s the sort of thing that tapers off after a while.\n\nThese results are super common in coal country\u2026 where are you?",

            "comment": "I would definitely test from the point u would get your water from for drinking. Who cares if it tests ok at the well when it simultaneously tests contaminated at your tap. You STILL have a problem. I would also test for led FIRST thing in the morning BEFORE ANYONE runs water in order to test if pipes are leaching lead into your water. Water sitting in the pipes all night get a dose of lead. Over time that could add up in you. There is a  formula to take samples every so many seconds over a couple minutes which will represent water sitting in your pipes over night at all the dodger points in your house, down the line, and st any soldering points down near the pump house. Lead could have been used at any juncture the way. If leaf\u2019s is leaking into the water, it isn\u2019t the end of the world; you can just let the water run and not use for anything that you would later eat. Ask what the water engineer recommends u do.",

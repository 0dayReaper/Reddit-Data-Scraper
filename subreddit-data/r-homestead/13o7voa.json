I've had zero problems with it, other than every bird wants to lay right in front of the door.\n\nRound One of cleaning the poop out is commencing, and I really, really wish I built it about two feet taller.\n\nOther than that, it survived its first Northern Minnesota winter with out any hiccups.",

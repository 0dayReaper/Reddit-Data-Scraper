Worse then them are Tomatillos! \n\nLast year was the first time I grew them, and knew almost zero about growing them apart from thinking they have a similar experience to tomatoes. Also I have a lot of clay in my soil(kentucky) so I planted 6 or 7 just to be sure I'd have at least one plant. \n\nTo my luck all of them survived and unbeknownst to me hopped over into the tomatoes and grew a separate stalk, they were like a friggin weed. I had sooooooo many of those things everywhere. It was nice to make so much salsa, but I also gave away three giant bags of them at my work. \n\nDidn't plant anything this year due to lots of things. But still had a few tomatillos shoot up in some weeds. I will only ever plant one or two in a garden now and prune it like crazy from now on.",

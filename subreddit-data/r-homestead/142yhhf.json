    "postText": "Hi, I'm new to keeping chickens and I've ran into a problem that I can't seem to shake. My hens aren't laying in their boxes! I have 3 hens of laying age (I got them from a farmer to start the flock and to have eggs while my chicks and ducks matured) and they did great for the first month or two! Didn't have a single one out of place. Then one of them started laying in a flower bed, she wasn't bothering anyone and was still laying there consistently so I would shoo her away if I saw her but didn't make a big deal out of it. Then, like something snapped overnight, I get at most 1 or 2 eggs in the box and the rest are COMPLETELY MIA from all hens. Today I had none. I tried everything please help. \n\nTLDR: hens laid in box at first, not laying in box anymore.",

Or you can blow a chicken egg and fill the shell with plaster and put it back in the box shell and all. \n\nJust mark your fakes so you don't accidentally collect them!",

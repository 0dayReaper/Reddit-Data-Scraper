You can still plant them, but be aware, they resulting bulbs aren\u2019t going to be as big. \n\nKeene Garlic is located in the Madison, WI area, and I get all my seed cloves from them. They\u2019ve got a huge section of how-to and advice. \n\nhttps://keeneorganics.com/planting-garlic-tips/\n\nMany more articles to go with that one. Great customer service, too.",

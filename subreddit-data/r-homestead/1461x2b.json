    "postText": "I have a bit of a ridiculous question. I've been meaning to reach out to my county's ag extension  office because I have a ton of questions about maintaining my property. From eliminating invasive plants (lots of underbrush, which leads to bare soil), erosion control (huge gullies from lack of ground cover), can I build a pond, where can/should I put fences, where can/should I run livestock. When emailing, how do I know who to reach out to? I believe I ultimately need a land management/forest management plan. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.",

I just reached out to my state university's ag extension office in my county with a pretty organized and detailed list of concerns and overall goals I have for the property, as well as what i know/can discern about its past use. This has been a LONG overdue step in the right direction!",

However, the grass in my garden is kind of a long and sordid story. \n\nThe first year I put my chicken flock in this whole area until it was quite denuded. Then I covered it with cardboard and wood chips. The next spring, I tilled and planted a nice in-ground garden. It produced for awhile and then completely succumbed to the weed pressure. \n\nThe second year my engineer husband planned this ultra-boring rectilinear cedar bed matrix and we built them. We lined all the pathways with plastic landscape fabric and covered it with woodchip mulch. [It was gorgeous!](https://i.imgur.com/tDJQXJu.jpg) For exactly one season. \n\nThe third year, the wood chips had composted and the pathways were now weeds. The moles had pushed the plastic away from the bottoms of the beds, so every bed was surrounded by a perfect slug habitat. \u201cSlug hunts\u201d became a family pastime. My toddler started stuffing them in his pockets. My daughter filled a bowl of slugs and dumped them in the kitchen trash. They found their way out. \n\nThe fourth year, we started painstakingly removing the plastic that had now basically become turf. We seeded perennial rye grass, which is non-rhizomic. It\u2019s a maintenance chore to cut, but doable.  \n\nThis year we are continuing to cut out that awful plastic. I have one corner where the grass keeps trying to invade the beds, so I have to chop it out every spring. I use cardboard in the fall to keep it at bay.",

I've been trying some commercial grade landscape fabric that's felted on the bottom and it's been working well so far in my no dig rows. I'm not sure what I'll do in the walk ways but leaning towards straight hardwood mulch and lots of it. I've also heard of people using other grasses and letting them grow tall as Bermuda struggles in shade and thrives in dry/barren open patches. \n\nMy cheaper weed barrier fabric from last year was a joke and the grass snuck right through the seams but rather than tear it up I just doubled over it with the new stuff this season. Sigh... It's been a process trying to figure out what works, what's worth the $ in materials, and what will require the least amount of maintenance time.",

    "postText": "Hello all, so i had four cucumber plants and two dill plants doing well in a raised bed from a barrel. A storm came through and broke the raised bed and one plant was left standing, it broke,i gave it some TLC and it seems to be growing. I have these other pepper plants that a former friend KILLED. I now have more seeds in peat pots as of three days ago in a garage with a grow light. So i have two questions,\n1) will that cucumber plant produce or will it just grow and do nothing since it broke?\n2) any tips on moving these plants indoors to get a full season out of them? They are green bell pepper plants and cucumber. Any and all help would be appreciated.",

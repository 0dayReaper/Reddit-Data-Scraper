Names and dates carved into it from the 1700s.   \n\nGot married under it later, still sit on the swing under it every summer.   Its the highlight of the property.\n\nA word of caution though now that you own a piece of history.  Learn from me.\n\nNever dig near it for any reason.  Dont pile anything under the base of it or within 30ish feet of the canopy.  Dont drive anything heavy near it.\n\nThrough ignorance i damaged my tree and its one of my greatest regrets.   I feel guilt every time i see the decline its taken because i didnt know better how to treat it.",

A tree that size is dangerous if it's near any buildings or vehicles and really expensive to remove. I've sadly had to remove several aging live oaks.

I loved that tree but it started dropping limbs. Took out the rear window of my mini van and was right next to the house. Had to take it down. They'll have to bring in a crane to get that down and the cost to haul it away is steep too.",

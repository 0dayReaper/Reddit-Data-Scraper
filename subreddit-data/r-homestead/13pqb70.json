    "postText": "I recently dug a well with a post hole auger in very sandy soil in northern Canada. The soil was sand until about 8 feet and the. Turned to solid clay. I dug another 5 feet into the clay. I put in a 4 inch casing with slots to allow water and poured pea gravel around it to hopefully keep the sand out. The problem is the sand is still coming in too fast and I\u2019m getting silty water. Should I give up?",

            "comment": "You need to get to well screen with slots sized to keep the sand out.  Btw you are getting water that may not be safe to drink because it\u2019s a shallow well.  You should have gone below the clay layer and into a deeper aquifer.   This will give you a safer and more reliable water supply.  If you decide to stay with what you have put in a whole house filtration system followed by a uv disinfectant system to provide clean disinfected water supply",

If it's the haze, that's from the clay, and there isn't much you can do about that except for getting below that clay layer.",

I\u2019ll try the sand point next time I\u2019m up there and see if I can make it happen",

It will hold up better against any sand that seeps through.  I would still make some provision for disinfecting the water.  Also make sure the septic leach lines or outhouse are at least 100 to 150 feet away from the well ( this mean your neighbors septic.  High iron water is treatable though.  If you tell me the iron concentrations I maybe able to help you with a solution",

    "postText": "Some history....\n\nLived on 5 acres (mostly wooded and dry area) in a new 1990's house until I was 18. Most activity I saw was deer traveling through the backyard.\tI was a nice property and loved that time in my life.\n\nMoved away (school/work/etc) to mostly urban areas until basically 50 years old.\n\nTalked my wife to moving out of the city to the country on 6 acres. We literally backup against State Forest Wildlife and protected areas. So we've seen it all in the past 10 months or so....birds, mice, chipmunks, squirrels, raccoons, feral cats, deer). Just waiting to see a bear next! :-)\n\nThe past few weeks/months have been a little tough animal-wise for me/us. I'm not really sure if my wife is getting depressed about the situation now too. I feel bad I talked her into moving out here.\n\nThe house is an early 1970's ranch house. After moving in, I was finding chewed through microwave popcorn bags in the cupboard eaten through and thought I was seeing things...Nope...We had mice! That freaked us both out.\n\nSo we've gotten the mouse population taken care of and they are gone from what we can tell. No rats, so I'm happy with that.  We have an exterminator that comes every 3 months to checkup on everything.\n\nRecently, this spring chipmunks ate through the siding of the house. (They are very fast at doing that.) I just fixed that. A couple of weeks ago a raccoon with a highly suspected case of canine distemper was in the front yard during the daytime walking around in circles and just seemed out of it. By the time I did the research and came home that night expecting to euthanize him, he died naturally.  (Which I hear is very unpleasant).\n\nWoke up the other night to a huge crash and looks like a raccoon took down the metal bird feeder. So we setup a live trap and caught a small/medium size raccoon. So we took him for a ride and relocated him five miles down the road on public land. Came back home and found that I probably just gave him his death sentence too. Supposedly they only live one to two months if relocated.\n\nYesterday, I was working in the garage and heard some noise....it was a chipmunk stuck to a sticky mouse trap. He was stuck and was starting to rip his leg off with blood everywhere. The only thing I could do was euthanize him. I felt really, really bad. But he was suffering. The old hose from a running Toyota did the trick.  I don't feel good about doing that!\n\nWe really like watching the birds and really all the animals to be honest - but it's starting to get a little aggrivating.  I thought a squirrel outsmarting my attempts to keep him off the feeders, I could tolerate.....but another raccoon showed up last night. I'm coming to the conclusion I'll be fighting wildlife forever here.\n\nI even thought I could deal with the woodchuck tearing up my lawn, but now he's really starting to make me mad.  Like really, really mad!  I'm about ready to poison him...but is that fair?  We moved in on his land.  I'm just not that kind of person.  Do I just keep planting grass?\n\nI'm trying to take a neglected ranch/horse property with vines choking out the trees, lots of invasive honeysuckle tree overgrowth, neglected house and barn, even the pond and bring it back to it's former glory.  Maybe I'm crazy.  I've replaced a well ($10,000)...windows ($15,000)...roof ($50,000)...and painted each room, replaced trim, replacing floors now.  I want this place to be nice for us in our golden years.  It's getting there.\n\nThe hours of all the work, money, time managing the brush, trying to bring the pond back - I'm invested now.  Literally!  My body hurts, but I just keep going.  I don't want to walk away from this - and probably can't.  All I can do it keep making it better for all involved.\n\nI feel like this has all gotten out of control and soon I'll literally be sleeping with my wife, dog and a pack of possums! Who knows.\n\nWe've kinda talked ducks/chickens, but I'd have to fight off their prey also.\n\nAnybody have any thoughts or words of wisdom to keep us from going insane here?  Am I doing it right?  Quit now?  etc, etc, etc.\n\nThanks!",

The birds LOVE the HOT PEPPER suet.  I don't know why, but they love it and ignore the others.  Weird.",

It is more unconscionable to have them when you live in an area with higher wildlife populations that would be at risk to cat predation (not only the pests, any small birds or mammals). Outdoor cats also have significantly lower life expectancies due to frequent exposure to parasites, larger predators, and bacteria. There are a lot of alternative solutions which cause less harm, and dogs are a better option environmentally speaking. This isn't an attack against you bc I totally get the desire to control rat populations, just trying to spread some important info. Almost all bird populations are in decline right now, and its going to become a serious issue for insect control. I've heard good things about trying to encourage owls to roost in barns, or even using their feces to deter pests (or even like, cougar urine, depending on where you live).",

Not only that, all of these studies themselves admit that the vast majority of kills are by feral cats, not house cats.  \n\nBy far the greatest threat to birds is the habitat destruction caused by human population growth. Whatever effect house cats may have is dwarved by humans just living the modern lifestyle they take for granted.\n\nhttps://www.felineresearch.org/post/issue-brief-wildlife-impacts-of-outdoor-cats",

EPM is a neurological issue, not night blindness which is an inherited trait.

EVERYTHING.  Something is going to happen and you're going to say 'this is it.  this is how I end \\[my homesteading dream\\].'  Now you can either accept that.  Or you can get to work.  That's all it is. You just *begin.*  You do the work.  You solve one problem.  And then the next.  And then the next.  And if you solve enough problems, you get to go \\[have a\\] home\\[stead\\].\"\n\nI think about that quote a lot.  Because it's such a parallel to homesteading.  All homesteading is is solving problems.  Every day.  Until you die.  My mom raised me on puzzles so it's right up my alley.  But I totally get how it drives other people crazy that it's just never done.  Never finished.  Always more to do.  ((Edit: And now that I think about it, he was really just a potato farmer.  So it really was all just about homesteading even on Mars. lol!))\n\nAll I can suggest is to start a list of all the reasons you'd want to keep at it and all the reasons you'd want to quit and see where you're at once you take an inventory of where you're really at with things.\n\nHomesteading may just be more than you really want to tackle if you're in that place where you just want to slow down and take it easy.  There's a reason people retire to retirement villages in Boca.  lol.

A homestead is never done, you have to enjoy making continuous repairs, and if something isn't broken, you'll come up with a new project that will have you tinkering. For better or for worse, it's the way of the homestead.\n\nAs for the mice and annoying animal life, I did get used to it. I don't have the same ecosystem here in Sweden, but I have voles, foxes, birds of prey, wolves and so on. I *hated* the mice, and then one day I heard mice in the walls and thought calmly to myself, \"Oh well, let's just wait until the house foundation is done, and see if the mice disappear. If they don't, on to a new plan.\" Pest prevention is a marathon, not a sprint, and the voles, snails and foxes which have plagued me all have their own prevention plans now.\n\nWe all have our bad days. I think I wrote here about a year ago because I felt absolutely overwhelmed with how many pests I was dealing with in the vegetable garden. But I just can't envision moving back to the city.

Drown traps are much less terrible to mice than glue, too. At least, if I was a mouse I'd rather get gotten by a drown trap than by a cat or glue trap or disease.\n\nI think you'd do well to think of yourself as just another animal in the local ecology. You change the landscape by being part of it -- by having food and shelter, you create niches for rodents, raccoons, etc. Your actions increase the local area's carrying capacity for those critters by default. The critters are short-lived enough that it's likely the ones that are actually hassling you weren't even born yet when you moved to the area. \n\nAs an animal in the ecosystem, you have a choice: Are you going to let these critters infringe on your niche, or are you going to hold your own niche open? You know what they'd do to you if the roles were reversed. \n\nAccepting the way in which we are animals as well as people is tough, but ultimately, playing by the animals' own rules is the most respectful and sustainable way to share an ecosystem with them.",

Barn cats are not typically sociable and will spend most of their days hidden. \nIt is generally safer for the ecosystem for property owners to have barn cats than to use poison.  Since the cats are altered they are not increasing the feral population. (Note: free range chickens will also eat mice).\nI would consider getting a LGD , such as a Great Pyrenees. When trained they will protect your property from predators. Squirrels and chipmunks tend to avoid a GP\u2019s territory. While they are suited for living outdoors most have very calm demeanors with people. \nIn closing, I feel for you. It\u2019s a difficult decision to make. Twelve years ago we bought our \u201cretirement\u201d home in 20 acres. We spend a lot of time there, yet still have to deal with the critters. My advice, try not to dwell on it.

Dogs can help keep some wildlife away, if you like dogs, but at the end of the day you live in nature, so you may have to work with the occasional raccoon or groundhog. As a gardener, I know your frustration too well. As for the house, it's a 1960s ranch. Things are going to need be replaced and updated occasionally.\n\nI have no advice that others haven't already shared, but take my word for it, do not get horses. If it's a good horse property, find horse people, let them do the work in exchange for board, or find someone to run a boarding operation there and take a small cut. Horse people are crazy though, so be careful.",

It has been SLOW going for me, and I had to come to terms with that.  You and your wife need to allow yourself more time. Don\u2019t put time deadlines on your progress.  Simply do the best you can, no matter how long it takes. \n\nThoughts Re: pests and predators\n\nGet one or two cats now.  They work better on mice than an exterminator and then you are not poisoning your land with exterminator chemicals.   \n\n     No judgement there, just want to keep your land and water clean clean clean.  \n\nCats will also take care of chipmunks.  If you don\u2019t have much room for cats food and box in house then maybe in garage.  (I only set up litter box in winter, they don\u2019t need one in warm months.)\n\nYou need a rifle or shotgun. You don\u2019t need to shoot to kill but to scare raccoons (and fishers?) away.  If that doesn\u2019t work though, you will need to shoot one and hopefully the others won\u2019t return.  It is hard. It is.  But you need to keep your home and family safe from predators. \n\nI had raccoons killing my chickens last year.  I tried everything to get them to leave and my coop was might tighter than Fort Knox.  Still they came back every night.  I had to stand guard at night on my deck in nightgown with rifle. Scaring them didn\u2019t work. Finally I did what I had to and shot 3 raccoons. By that time though I truly saw them as an enemy though.  Was surprised and shocked at how it was NOT traumatic to shoot them. \n\nTomorrow I pick up a livestock guardian dog. Predators have started being intense again in past month, and I don\u2019t want to do this again and again. \n\nI wish I got a dog 2 years ago.  Honestly would have been smart. \n\nHaving a dog is a predator deterrent- just the sounds, smells, and sight of a big dog will keep many predators away.  The dog will scare them. Dog\u2019s last resort is to attack the predator. \n\nPLEASE don\u2019t use those sticky tape mouse catchers- the mouse or whatever gets stuck and is tortured and screams.  Not humane at all.  A cat killing a mouse is how nature works and less torturous for the mouse. \n\nIt will get better.  Don\u2019t be too hard on yourselves.  And it is easy to become depressed when things don\u2019t go like we thought they would. But regroup and give yourselves some Grace.",

But this is my eden and i enjoy the work, it really just the heat thats unbearable at times. \nI wanted to say that you have to work within the ecosystem.\nFor example, we have chickens. And coyotes, foxes, hawks, etc. So we got 2 donkeys. They dont come around anymore, lol.\nOur pasture was overgrazed. We added goats. Theyre eating, and fertilizing. We add cover crop seeds each season. Well do this until we dont have to anymore. \nOur garden area is nitrogen deficient and lacks organic matter, but it has a gentle slope for good drainage, 2 water sources and full sun. So were adding all that manure to amnend the soil with cover crops in the winter. \nIm not a total fan of permaculture, but they say if you have waste, theres a gap in your system. I think about that frequently when i have a problem. So for the raccoons, i would stop the birdfeed. Then i would add plants to feed them instead. I have hummingbirds and big bumblebees that come to my lavender and comfry. I dont keep the feeders bc they draw ants and wasps. Ive added sunflowers too this year. And 80 lilac trees ($1/each from the state tree nursery). One they mature theyll be great for pollinators. \nWe started getting rats in the barn. I didnt want to poision bc we like the hawks and owls here (they keep other pest populations down) and the poisioned rats can posion the birds. And the sticky traps are cruel. So we just got 2 barn cats. The rats disappeared overnight. \nBasically, if youre adding something to the established system, you should anticipate a problem and think through how to prevent it. The perk is that you can also add to attract what you want. \nGood luck to you with whichever decision you make.",

Take it step by step and work with the wildlife to a certain point. You have to be willing to constantly compromise Got a woodchuck ripping up lawn? Let that area overgrow with brushes and it's his. No one needs a perfect lawn. Got a woodchuck eating your veggies. Make it its own garden or Shoot it. \n\nEveryone I know, both city and rural, has had mice in their house at some point, or constantly. It's just a thing. Keep your food sealed up in thick plastic and metal!\n\nI have never seen someone living rurally call an exterminator for mice. So that is new to me. Set different types of traps that kill quickly (snap traps, electric traps), if you don't want them dead you can do the bucket traps and relocate and let nature eat them at least. No Poison - they die slowly in your walls and crevices and when eaten by other animals they will also kill the predator. NO sticky traps - worst death possible. \n\nYou will probably have to get rid of the bird feeder if you don't like raccoons, opossums, bears and squirrels in your yard. You can try planting bushes and trees birds love to eat and nest in instead.\n\nWith animals my thing is to either give them the kindest death (fast deaths) or at least let them be food for other animals. If you can deal with cats eating small animals, trying getting a couple. No promises they will hunt though. Also they will eat birds so no bird feeder.\n\nGet a .22 rifle and learn to shoot it appropriately at close range.\n\nGood luck, you get used to some things. Others you learn to compromise on.",

(horrible at it, luckily) if you kill them more will always come to fill their space, and anything they were preying on or competing with will get worse. (IE, raccoons eat mice, if you try and get rid of all the raccoons there will be more mice) I would recommend moving the bird feeders as far as you can from the house, that will help keep rodents out.\n\nthinking ecologically helps a lot. if the groundhog is destroying your lawn it may be because it doesn't have anywhere else to do groundhog stuff - leaving a part of the property wild helps a lot. I'm on 5 acres and 3/4 of it is untouched field and woods. I only keep a small fenced front and back yard mowed. most of the wildlife I see stays outside of the fence, I only get mice, raccoons and occasional foxes inside.\n\nif they're giving you a headache now I would recommend holding off on poultry because they'll be a much bigger headache when you wake up to find that they've torn the heads off half your flock and chewed a bunch of holes in the feed bags lol. unless you\u2019re up for building an expensive fort-knox-esque coop and run that\u2019s how it\u2019s likely to go.",

Like really, really mad! I'm about ready to poison him...but is that fair? We moved in on his land. I'm just not that kind of person. Do I just keep planting grass?\n\nConsider whether you really need a flawless golf fairway, or whether you just need a green carpet of whatever plants are around to walk on.  \"Tearing up your lawn\" might be something you find totally tolerable if you step back a bit and ask yourself what your goals are.  There are people who spend tens of hours and thousands of dollars a year pursuing the hobby of lawncare, and not all of them have a lot of perspective on what it adds to their lives.\n\n&gt;We really like watching the birds and really all the animals to be honest - but it's starting to get a little aggrivating. I thought a squirrel outsmarting my attempts to keep him off the feeders\n\nRodents are going to be extremely interested any time you lay out grain; Are the birdfeeders necessary?  Could they be sited more appropriately further from the house?  Is it a problem if you're feeding the squirrels?  Keeping the squirrels off of the feeders themselves isn't too hard with baffles and poles, but keeping them from chowing down on the fallen seed is significantly more difficult.  Removing food sources is by far the most effective way to deal with rodents.\n\n&gt;a chipmunk stuck to a sticky mouse trap.\n\nCats and dogs can deal with the rodents as long as you're not concerned about their effects on the birds.\n\nGlue traps are awful both ethically and from a maintenance perspective, snap traps are also high-maintenance.  People who operate granaries and chicken coops find the best luck with bucket traps which can catch many mice between daily or weekly resets.",

If you don't want to go that route, consider something like building owl habitat.\n\nJust work your way towards making the immediate area around you inhospitable for rodents and coons. That will take away 90% of your issues.",

We got tough on them and had to do a lot of trapping. \n\nSo yea it sucked for a long time but this summer has been awesome with no problems.

I personally think even in villages, people use chemical fertilizers or pesticides. I am new to this, so I would like to learn from the community where I would be living about farming with only natural fertilizers and like. \n\nI feel the videos and guides online will help to some extend, but the process may wary according to the geographical conditions where you live.",

You need a closed barrel system, though. The water goes through the hose to the barrel until the barrel is full, then pressure builds up and the line fills and floods the little U bend in the diverter. After that, water flows down the downspout normally. The great thing about this system is that you can daisy chain as many barrels as you want, then have the overflow still go down your normal downspout, so you minimize erosion.",

If I can seal this to the hose when the hose becomes submerged the water will pressurize and activate the diverter.  Thank you!",

There is an old stone \"cistern\" that I think might be a water well (but for legal reasons the owner didn't call it one) but it's slow to recover. The P.O went and put an underground 1\u00bd\" PVC pipe from near the house downspout into the stone cistern.  I want to hook this up now and I'm finding the commercial solutions look like I'd lose most of the water with these wings, baskets or paddles that are \"intended to\" duct water to a garden hose fitting as seen in my picture.  Simple logic says the water is going to take the path of least resistance and go straight down.  Has anyone built or bought a good system or adapter I can use (or 3D print) to reroute the water \\~100% until it's full, and then it bypasses?",

But in my case, I just let all of the water go to into my barrel through a screen. And the barrel itself has an overflow.",

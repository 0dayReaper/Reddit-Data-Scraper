Just curious.  I am starting to see grasshopper nymphs and it will soon be to late to treat.\n\nSide question, what does everyone else use for grasshoppers?",

Not a good mix.\nHad grasshopper so bad a decade ago, they ate the fiberglass screens on the windows.  So hopefully I have enough nosema in the environment that some will still be active",

Got to be additional issues over this amount of time.\nI find it comical that if you search for an alternative to Nolo Bait, one of the suggestions is called EcoBran grasshopper bait.  Active ingredient is carbaryl.  I guess since it is bound to bran flakes it might not hurt my bees, but that ain't gonna happen",

The 1 and 3 entry on the table are what I would be unsure about.  Line 4 is not likely to be a problem due to pH and in theory could be made safe by boiling it into a soup for 15 minutes or so. But still don't think I would even take a chance on that one because the consequences are fairly severe.",

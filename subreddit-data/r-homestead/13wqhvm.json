    "postText": "I am in the process of planning out a water well for a future project, and want to know if I can have a single well be powered with an electric pump for the house and a windmill to fill/aerate a pond? I tried doing some research and everything is comparing power sources. I could just use the electric pump to feed the pond, but I am trying to save on energy costs in the long run for the pond, and will want a windmill regardless to aerate. This would also give me a backup water source if power was lost which I like. Anyone have any experience with this?",

            "comment": "My grand father used a windmill for his water cistern. He had a back up gas engine sitting on the ground, for when there was no wind. If I remember correctly, he had the engine mounted in a way that he could simply take the belt off of the engine for windy days, and put it back on when he needed it. A very rudimentary clutch system, if you will.",

            "comment": "I'm going to say that yes, in theory you could run a well off of both. In practice it would be tough because you'd have to have some kind of control that would automatically switch from wind to electric whenever there was a call for water and the wind was insufficient. The easiest way would be to use the windmill to fill a large cistern and then use a powered pump and pressure tank to serve the house. Depending on grade/volume desired/distance you could theoretically run irrigation on a gravity fed system, or just use another pump to irrigate your garden.",

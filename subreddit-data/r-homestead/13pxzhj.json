    "postText": "Are nematodes for ticks safe to use around pigs, chickens, and Guinea hens? We have an explosion of ticks this year.  The pigs have had an average of seven ticks on each of them every day. We have even had ticks in the house this year. I read that nematodes can help, but I wanna be sure the animals won\u2019t be harmed in the process. Thanks!",

            "comment": "The best method for reducing ticks is removing their habitat. Keep grasses short and the pigs away from tree lines etc. Keeping poultry in the same area helps tremendously, especially if you don\u2019t feed them in the morning and let them free range having to search for ticks. After a while you\u2019ll see a tremendous improvement and significant reduction of ticks. I kept poultry for just this reason and had them working overtime. In fact, they seemed to love free ranging and they get more efficient with time. Yes, you will loose birds to predators and need to handle that according (00 buck). You can try and purchase food grade d-limonene (1 part) and mix it with isopropyl alcohol (3 parts) in a spray bottle and spray some on their backs, neck but away from their eyes. It\u2019s a good natural repellent for yourself. I add citronella, lemongrass and oregano essential oil to my mix. You can get creative. The spray last a while. Here\u2019s a link to the d-lemonene I buy.

Again, eliminating the ticks habitat, mowing often and adding tick hunting poultry like chickens works well.",

            "comment": "IPPs are no different from other pigs. The only difference is they will graze some while most other pigs just tear it up. But like a pig they need more protein and fat than pasture can provide them, so they cannot be pure pasture. They are omnivores, not herbivores. The best thing for pigs is milk and dairy. The more the better. They need the lysine. \n\nHistorically pigs were grazed in forests and especially under nut bearing trees like oaks or walnuts, then supplemented with whatever else came out of the farm. Like veggie scraps, cracklings from rendering tallow or lard, chicken skeletons, leftovers from canning (like cucumber ends from making pickles), organs and offal from butchering, off milk or cheese, stale bread, cracked eggs, etc. Pigs are the farm's garbage can and they fill that ecological niche very well!\n\nAs far as rotation goes it depends on how much you want them to till the land. If you don't want much tillage then you will need to move them more often, but if you intend to use them as the torpedo shaped tractors they are (IPPs are less so but they still are) then you can leave them in one spot longer. Just make sure they have plenty of shade, water, and a wet place to wallow. Lard pigs are a bit less heat tolerant than meat-type pigs because they make more lard. We lost an IPP during a heat wave because of that.",

            "comment": "We raise some IPPs and like the commenter above said our experience has been that the pasture just supplements their feed. When they are on good pasture I\u2019ll cut their feed down by about 1/2. I\u2019ll also throw some mineral in there because I have heard that will keep the rooting to a minimum. They are definitely less destructive then other pigs we have raised like Durocs or GOS, but I do still move them about every 4 days because they are still pretty rough on the pasture. Our pigs are in pairs and each pair has about a 20\u2019x20\u2019 area. 4 acres is probably plenty for the 3, our pigs are rotated on the cattle pasture so it\u2019s hard to say for sure, but I bet they use up less than an acre. They get pinned up in the fall and we wait until the spring flush to put them back out. Hope that helps",

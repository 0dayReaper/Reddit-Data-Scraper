    "postText": "Y'all in the final survey, Abrams really tryna have WEEKLY EXAMS for a total of 12 exams for the entire semester wtf. Idk who thought that was a good idea, but even if they are only 30-45 mins and 2 lowest get dropped that's still just weekly stress for poor students in a class that is already hard as fuck. It would be a weekly cycle of hell and every weekend going to chem studying cuz exams on Mondays.",

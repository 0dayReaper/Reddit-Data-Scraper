    "postText": "Info: I ended up enrolling for BU however I still have the option to not go. I\u2019m a incoming sophomore from UConn. I\u2019m having a tough time deciding where to go. Both ended up being the about same price for me, however UConn aid is not guaranteed every year while BU is. I\u2019m a current bio major on the pre med track but I\u2019m considering switching to CS. A lot of my questions are more feelings based. \n\nQuestions - \nHow is the travel abroad program? \n\nSince it\u2019s the same price is a higher ranked cs or bio degree better?\n\nWhat are the school sports like?\n\nHow bad is grade deflation? I have a decent gpa right now I want to make sure I keep it just incase I stay on the pre med track.\n\nWhat does campus look like? Uconn and BU campus feel a lot different. Are there parts that feel like a campus instead of a city? I only did a general non guided tour. Are there any just grass fields or parks to get away from the city?\n\n\n\n\nThanks",

            "comment": "Alright, lemme try to help with this question!\r  \n1. The travel abroad program is amazing imo! Both of my roommates have gone to study abroad (Sydney &amp; Copenhagen), and have created connections with a shitton of friends, had pretty chill classes (with a real good amount of free time), and had once-in-a-lifetime experiences (Traveling across europe, Visiting great barrier reef)\n\n\r  \n2. I\u2019m not part of CS or Bio, but I would assume that the higher rank, and possible higher academic rigor would make it a better school, at least in terms of apply to Grad/Med School. It\u2019s kinda what you make of it tho, there are a bunch of opportunities that you can take advantage of at BU (Research, Clubs, Recruiting and Alumni Connections) that may make it better and may help with that ranking kinda shit, but honestly idk\r  \n\n\n3. School sports are kinda hit or miss. We got an amazing hockey scene, with BU winning Hockey East, and getting all the way to the NCAA Frozen 4. Along with that, the Dog Pound and the BU Band keep everything real fun for games. Along with that, we got a real fun basketball(WBB &amp; MBB) team that always have a decent crowd. Outside of that, Lacrosse, Soccer, and Rugby(even tho theyre club), always get a respectable club, but have less of a presence compared to the previous programs. Either way, there always seems to be something going on, so have fun with that!\n\n\r  \n4. As a Engineer, grade deflation feels like it kinda exists, but I can\u2019t really say much bout CS or Bio. Some classes you can skate by without really too much effort, but there are a few (2-3 a semester), that ya gotta go to the classes, create study groups, or go to discussion/office hours, to make sure that you pass with a good grade. I will say that the intro classes are usually killer(ex. CH101), but after you get outta those, its not too bad.\n\n\r  \n5. The campus is pretty fun imo! Its kinda get into a few sections, but all kinda runs across commonwealth ave. East/Central Campus is chill, and where all the academic buildings, and 2/4 dining halls exist. South is kinda more private livin, and felt a bit more chill. And then west campus/allston is fun! You got ur frats, ur high level livings(stuvi), ur sports houses and fun stuff. Ya got ur parties, some pretty good food and shit, so if ur into that, great area to look into. Ig the campus feel is really a bit weird, but it all kinda works out once u find ur friend group. Finally, there are a decent amount of parks/grass fields u can go to. If u wanna get a nice picnic place, Armory Park is pretty chill, and if u wanna just enjoy the boston environment, the Boston Commons are just a 20 minute train ride away! Hope this helped",

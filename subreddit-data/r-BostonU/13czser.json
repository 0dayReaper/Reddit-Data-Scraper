I ended up getting an email from BU a month later pretty much saying that the college of engineering is rigorous and that my grades were not acceptable. Then they were like, we could take away your acceptance but nah just come in September and b a good noodle.  hope this helps!",

That's pretty risky, and it's always better to be safe than sorry for a situation that dictates whether or not you'll be going to a college for 2-3 more years lol. I believe someone got a D in a class for their major and got rescinded last year. I would try to get in contact with someone to explain your circumstances. Trying to retake the same class over the summer may not be a bad idea if you can explain to them that you're correcting your mistakes.",

But I also think depending on how well your transcript looks in comparison (is this the first time ever failing, what does ur gpa look like, etc) makes a difference. When I got the grade I contacted admissions and expressed my worries about my offer being rescinded and also to find out what I could do to remedy it. the guy there was like eh you\u2019ll be fine, honestly pretty useless. and then I just waited until I eventually got that letter from BU. so I think regardless of what you do, you will find out sooner or later. But even though it feels like it didn\u2019t make a difference to me it made me feel like I did all I could. reach out (call don\u2019t email it\u2019s quicker) !! and just ask any and all questions you have. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine!! :)",

    "postText": "So, I am going be a junior this fall and I got notified that my finacial aid is incomplete. The thing they want from me is a dependency status verification since I am independent. The weird thing is that i have given my verification when i was applying for aid the 1st time and then the previous summer i didn't have to submit another verification. I really don't know what to do.",

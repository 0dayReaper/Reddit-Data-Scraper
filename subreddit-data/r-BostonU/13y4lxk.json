The only way to contact them is via the web form, maybe your specific advisor but what if you don't have one yet?\n\nPeople will call IT because they don't know what else to do and IT doesn't know their phone number either.",

And even if they were updating a single page like Contact Us, most BU department websites have their email address and phone in the footer of the whole website, so it's on every page even if it's not hard coded into the content of a specific page.\n\nAnd their phone number used to be on there because I would look it up for people. Now it's gone.",

But if I\u2019m just looking to purchase alcohol, will a packie somewhere like Chinatown accept a fake? It\u2019s a good fake. It even scans on this mobile ID scanner app and pulls up the details, and I look passable 21, barely. Thanks in advance for your replies",

Oh and, fakes are really easy to identify. Using them is really stupid.",

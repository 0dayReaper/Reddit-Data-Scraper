    "postText": "Hii!! I got accepted as a transfer for the fall of 23' and I was wondering how strict the policy is here about revoking a decision. I got in with a GPA of 3.8 but this last semester killed me and it dropped a good amount. Is it likely they would rescind their offer? I know it's incredibly rare, but me being an English major who got a C in stats and a B in Anthro, I am so worried they're going to go back on their decision. Thoughts??",

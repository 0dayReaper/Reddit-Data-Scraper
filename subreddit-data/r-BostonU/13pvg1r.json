Unsure of what it could be, and being only a tiny bird, it tried to take cover. The fitrec awning! Perfect!!!!!!! Danger would never look there!!!!! As bird cowered, hoping danger would soon pass, the tiny EMP pulse hit. Little bird only knew that it should have poo'ed on that blue cap she had passed earlier......",

When BU was renting the boat house it may have been a requirement to offer services to the community (let ppl row), but BU now owns it. It's not open to the public or the BU community except the pro rowers.\n\nRowing is a very expensive sport, with boats costing like good cars. But I don't think that's the issue, since, again, the program been around forever. It's the coaches. CRI or gentle giant are good places to learn.",

Has anyone ever had this happen?  I considered reaching out to him and/or the department head about the possibility of retaking the exam...",

A department head doesn't generally have too much oversight in regards to academic misconduct; that's the domain of the Dean of Students (or area Dean for the College/Faculty). A Dept. Chair also doesn't have authority over the faculty, rather it's the Dean of Students. Usually they have oversight over curriculum, appointments (hiring), committee assignments, as well as tenure &amp; promotion. Basically going to a Dept. head is akin to tattling to someone else. Without context it's impossible to know why this student was forced out, and therefore impossible to tell them what to do next.",

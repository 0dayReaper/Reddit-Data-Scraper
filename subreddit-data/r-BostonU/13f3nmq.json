    "postText": "I'm transferring from another college and I had to take the spring semester off, Right now I'm planning how I could fulfill my Major and HUB requirements to graduate on time, I also want to do 2 minors, one of which has courses crossed with my major. Is it feasible to do 2 minors and 1 major in 3 years?\n\nNote: The Major would be Economics and the minors Business Administration and Public Relations; I have 16 credits from my previous college",

            "comment": "It\u2019s possible, but definitely not without overloading (however you\u2019ll need to overload regardless of major/minor to meet 128 credits).\n\nHere are some tips as an econ major, business minor (I know nothing about public relations minor).\n\nI think transfers only need 10 hub units, and 5 should be fulfilled from econ prereq and principal courses (SO1/SO2, QR2, ETR, CRT, RIL). To my knowledge, none of the econ courses fulfill SI1, PLM, AEX, CRI. Plan accordingly. Try to fill as many hubs with major/minor classes.\n\nIf you take SM131 and SM132 the same semester, either don\u2019t overload that semster or take an easy class. Both classes require a lot of work. A good amount of people have to retake 132 (if you like and are good at finance, it won\u2019t be bad, just time consuming for 2 cr).\n\nOverall, plan well and meet with advisors (from all colleges), and you can probably do it, but it won\u2019t be easy.",

    "postText": "\n\nI\u2019m afraid to go to graduation this weekend. I graduated in January and was always on the fence about going to the spring ceremony. At the end of the fall semester I felt like I\u2019d feel differently a few months later. Now, I\u2019m just feeling extremely anxious about going. I really feel like the dept head of my major bullied me the last two semesters I was there. I still don\u2019t know why I was treated so badly??? I used to go over every situation and interaction I had with them to see where things went wrong or what I should have done differently. \n\nI genuinely hated waking up every day and having to act unaffected by their behavior.  Unfortunately, I was in 2 of their classes my final term, and it was just so exhausting. I feel really anxious about potentially having to be near them and don\u2019t know what I should do??? \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t have any cords or anything like that. I\u2019m not sure if cords are a big thing here?? I\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s a big deal at other schools and feel kind of insecure about it. If I go, I don\u2019t want to feel like I shouldn\u2019t be there at all. \n\nOn a positive note, I\u2019m starting a graduate program in the fall and feel like I should just be grateful for that and forget about all of this. However, there is a little part of me that wants to go???? Idk. I\u2019d really appreciate some advice from you all.",

If you don\u2019t go I think that\u2019s fine too - a lot of people don\u2019t go to anything. Do what fits you",

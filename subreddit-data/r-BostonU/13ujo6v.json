Is this normal? I\u2019m hoping to get a single but i know it will be tough. Btw which area is best for an engineering student. I wouldn\u2019t want to be staying at the other side of the campus and have to commute pretty long distances LOL thanks guys",

            "comment": "I was also a sophomore transfer a few years ago- housing is assigned to transfer students, so you won't get to pick. From my experience, they tend to put transfer students in south campus, which you will probably appreciate as an engineering student. Most of your classes will be in photonics, epic, and CAS which are all close to south campus. Another good place for engineers is east campus (which is also close to all aforementioned lecture halls), though like I said you'll be assigned and don't get to pick. From what I remember I thought transfers were at least allowed to rank their preferences, but maybe they've done away with that.",

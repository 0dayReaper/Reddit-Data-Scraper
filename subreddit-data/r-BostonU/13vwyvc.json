I think they called me once three years ago for a donation, but did not take into account the time zone difference as it was 3 AM for me on Saturday. It is a shame given how many students school facilitates into labor market year. The initiative needs to be funded properly imo, what do you all think?",

Even with more resources and fewer graduates, I doubt Harvard closely follows every alum. The reality is you (and other alumni) only got a direct call because they're trying to squeeze some more money out of you. \n\n\nI wouldn't sit around expecting a large organization to care about you specifically as an individual and give you calls more than half a decade after you graduated. But if alumni relations are important to you and you want to reconnect with the university or other alums, there are alumni events hosted semi-regularly in certain geographies and I encourage you to seek out those programs/events the university hosts.\n\n---\nhttps://trusted.bu.edu/s/1759/2-bu/19/interior.aspx?sid=1759&amp;gid=2&amp;pgid=1050",

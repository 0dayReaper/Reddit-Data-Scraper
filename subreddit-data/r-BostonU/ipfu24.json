Apparently he didn't know that I graduated from BU. To bolster my cred, I said, \"Yeah, I founded the BU subreddit a decade ago.\" [EDIT: During Jariwala's CS112 morning lecture. Is he still teaching?]\n\n... I'm looking forward to the new mod, whoever they may be. Also, do any alumni know how to get their youthful vigor back? Asking for a friend.\n\nLove,\nYour friendly neighborhood grouchy alumnus\n\nEDIT: My adult life is a lie. Sullivan was my CS prof. I had Jariwala for PY212 the previous semester.",

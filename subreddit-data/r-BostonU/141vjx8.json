It\u2019s really easy to minor.\n\nFirst fill out minor declaration form:\nhttps://www.bu.edu/cas/academics/undergraduate-education/academic-advising/advising/minor-declaration-form/\n\nFirst two classes you have to take are SM131 and SM132. (I don\u2019t know if you can register for these as 1st semester freshman if you\u2019re not in Questrom, but I don\u2019t really know all the details. You can definitely do it 2nd sem.) Both are somewhat time consuming. Don\u2019t be fooled by SM132 being 2cr, many people struggle with it. Once you finish those (with at least a C-), I suggest taking AC221 (the only other required course).\n\nAfter that you can take any of the electives listed here:\nhttps://www.bu.edu/academics/questrom/programs/minor-in-business-administration-management/\n\nAs a side note, I know you asked about Questrom, but you can take classes from other colleges as well. Just make sure you have the prereqs, and if you\u2019re ever unsure just ask an advisor.",

I was in CAS and had to do a lot of networking to be able to skip core questrom classes (e.g., FE, SM) to take the few higher level courses I was interested in as student link wouldn\u2019t let me directly enroll due to the missed official pre-reqs, and professors had to directly enroll me which was a bit of a hassle.",

I see there is a dual degree program, but that is for double majoring, not for a major and a minor, so I don't think it applies to this. If you google it and find something, please share and I will be thankful.",

This is what you could find by googling questrom minor. You could take classes in questrom, though for the SM131/SM132 classes, some sections are specific for freshmans/transfers. To minor, you can google like CAS minor declaration and you\u2019ll find it, there\u2019s like a form or stuff, to fill in.",

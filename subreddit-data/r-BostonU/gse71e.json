    "postText": "Hey everyone, I graduated from CAS in 2019. This past month I built the website [RateMyDorm.com](https://RateMyDorm.com) \\- think RateMyProfessors but for dorms. You can write a review on a  BU dorm, filter through dorms based on amenities, ratings, or class year, and read reviews from other students. I'm hoping this can grow to a platform that will be helpful to all students. If you can help contribute, please check out the site and rate the BU dorms you've lived in! Thanks - Jed",

I've decided on keeping the dorms divided in a general sense, and this is how i broke it down for the other universities in the page as well. I figured it would still be helpful for students who are debating between two residences, like south vs bay state for example.",

I can guarantee you that both bay state and south have the same range of quality of housing, from pretty bad to pretty good. This wouldn't be all that helpful. \n\nBut it's a great idea and a great start! I'd love to see future iterations of this, and I'll probably get around to adding reviews for the 3 places in south I lived lol",

The social life really depends on who\u2019s on your floor\u2013 my floor really didn\u2019t talk to each other at all which was a little strange. But, at least if it\u2019s your first year, a lot of your friends should also be living there too. The dining hall is convenient, too. Personally, my room probably had something in the carpet that made my roommate and I sick for the entire year, but that was really the worst part.\n\nlmao",

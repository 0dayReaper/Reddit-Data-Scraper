I'm so so so utterly confused. I'm in CDS and I literally don't know what to do. Please help. \n\nBoston University is by far the shittiest at communication about enrollment to it's incoming freshman. I've been panicking for the past month because everyone else seems to have information that I don't.",

HOWEVER, the Student Link registration system DOES become available to freshmen on June 1st, and remains open until a few weeks into September (plenty of time!!). BU's communication can def get frustrating but feel free to DM if you have any questions!!\n\nHere are some resources for CDS:\n\n[Flow Chart](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/files/2023/01/CDS-DS_01.17.23.pdf)\n\n[Registration Course Recs/Guide](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/programs-admissions/undergraduate/registration-guide-for-the-data-science-major%e2%80%af/)",

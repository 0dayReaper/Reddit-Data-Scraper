Different people have different skill sets, I may be in engineering but there\u2019s no way I could/would want to do some of the stuff COM, CFA, and CAS does.

They just have a hard time finding a job post-college, it's an unwise decision to major in a job you'll be lucky to make 30k in( if you find a job) when you'll be knee-deep in 50k debt. But I'm sure richy rich daddy will take care of you. Look at the statistics these majors are frequently unemployed and underemployed. Trust me humanities and arts have there place in society and are beautiful and necessary. But every STEM class I have taken I've had to put twice or thrice as much time and effort into it compared to anything arts or humanities-related. Its the difference between a 25-hour workload vs. 50+ hours.",

I can't speak for every major, but linguistics at least is 20+ pages of readings twice a week for each class so that can easily stack up to 80+ pages of readings due twice a week. It's also not super intuitive material either it's dense academic text. if you think it's super easy I recommend attempting to caption a spectrogram or try some lambda calculus on for size",

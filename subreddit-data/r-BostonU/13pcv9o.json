I did NOT want to be made aware of the people fighting for a living wage and it was inconsiderate and rude of all of you to be so loud and whiny. Protest should be done in a way that doesn\u2019t make people uncomfortable so I can live in my little bubble of elitism and never feel the need to take action ever. \n\nCommencement should have been a day about ME and MY RIGHT to listen to a crusty man deliver the worst speech of all time. \n\nDaddy zaslav\u2019s dick and balls are scrumdiddlyumptious.

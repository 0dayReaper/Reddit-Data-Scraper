    "postText": "i didn\u2019t get my final exam or essay grade back for cm180 until the 13th (exam and essay were on april 27th and may 4th respectively). i got a 78 on a two page \u201cessay\u201d about tiktokers (it was basically a worksheet with allotted space to answer each question in the prompt). i\u2019m personally dumbfounded that such a low stakes assignment would be graded that harshly. but anyway i emailed the prof and 3 TAs yesterday asking why they knocked over 20 points off. with grading deadlines, is there any hope for my grade to be changed? :(",

    "postText": "Incoming Junior Transfer here. I was hoping I could get some advice on both the registration and housing processes. \n\nI will still need roughly 7 Hub requirements, and a year of language, so was wondering if people had advice on which requirements to focus on outside of my major. \n\nFor housing: Does on-campus housing just get assigned randomly or are you able to self-select the physical space?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Basically what was already said about HUB for some classes required in your major should fill some HUB. Double dipping is a great way to fill the hub quick as well. \n\nFor housing, you can choose to either prioritize what type of housing you want (apartment, suite, dorm) or something else like the location I think? I don\u2019t remember but they assign you to what\u2019s left over.",

            "comment": "Hi! I transferred Fall 2020 and just graduated. Happy to answer any more questions you have, the process can be extremely overwhelming, trust me I get it! \n\nA lot of my HUB requirements were fulfilled by my major, so I would sit down and try to map your plan of study (minus HUB electives) now, and see how many you can knock out with just your current required classes. Then, go back and fill in the gaps. I recommend \"The Nazi\" with Professor Zatlin if it's being offered - really great course, easy workload. \n\nYou can \"rank\" your housing choices. In my experience, transfers mainly end up in Warren, Myles, or South. Opt for South if possible, unless you're looking for more community then Warren is a better choice (with it's respective downfalls). If you're feeling motivated, hunt around the transfer FB group and this subreddit to see if someone can pull you into something nicer.",

If so, you can take some classes to fulfill both.language classes if im not wrong fulfills one hub unit.\n\nFor housing, if I\u2019m not wrong, for transfers, it\u2019s assigned.",

A girl in my sorority studied Polish for like two months her senior year and was able to test out of it. On the other hand, my native Spanish speaking roommate was placed into Spanish 2 (but I think it was a lot more due to differences in dialect rather than ability).",

            "comment": "You a [marine](https://www.bu.edu/bump/academic-programs/undergraduate/) major? Only marine majors take MR144. Maybe throw a [required WR](https://www.bu.edu/writingprogram/writing-program-curriculum/transfer-credit/) class instead of an EE, 3 seems like a lot, and if you need to do the [CAS language requirement](https://www.bu.edu/cas/academics/undergraduate-education/academic-advising/advising/language-advising/foreign-language-requirement/) (if you're NOT a native speaker of another language), start considering that! Do you need BI107 or CH101 or MA123 or PY211 for your major (assuming you're STEM)? It's important to balance your schedule to be a mix of different types of classes.\n\nAnyway, it's hard to say \"yes, great schedule good job\" without any extra info. Your major, what credits do you have, which credits do you need, etc etc etc... Might be too personal to throw out there to the whole world, but this is exactly what [advisors](https://www.bu.edu/cas/academics/undergraduate-education/academic-advising/advising/) are for!!!!!!!",

Make sure you take EE144 now and BI260 in the spring as they are prereqs for the marine semester which only happens in the fall (so your senior fall semester). Some of my friends are doing it and it seems like an awesome opportunity!! Otherwise, I might maybe substitute in either a WR class or a language class because they are a real inconvenience and it is a good idea to get them out of the way! Might also consider the physics requirement.\n\nSo the AH, EE144, another EE, and either WR/PY/lang as the four courses would be my recommendation. Completely up to you though, you can complete those requirements any time you want!!",

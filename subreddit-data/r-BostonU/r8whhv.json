I made a map of the BUS since the Terrier Transit app kinda sucks; hopefully, it helps you in your transportation endeavors (especially if you're a freshie like me and have no clue where anything is). There's a version with T services and one without and I'd be happy to make any adjustments you think might be helpful, just let me know!",

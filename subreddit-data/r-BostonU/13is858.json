Whatever the topic is that\u2019s listed on StudentLink is NOT what y\u2019all will be talking about \u2014 it\u2019s just a BEAM/BEAT model learning class. \n\nWhen I had her my freshman year, she came unprepared for class all the time and managed to blame us for it, her class was taught like a high school class and she made us turn and talk to our neighbor every five seconds, I like writing and she somehow made it BORING AS HELL, and I\u2019ve heard that she\u2019s been rude, ignorant, and classist to other students. \n\nYeah, the workload is manageable but she got on my nerves a lot the last few weeks and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it for her class, even if I did good work and got an A.",

    "postText": "I am very poor, very minority, Transfer student. I had decent grades so maybe i will get merit? I am awaiting an email but I am going to another school if its too much so time is of the essence.\n\nMy parents are not helping me I have no money across the board. \n\nI am coming from out of state and I will need to live on or close to campus. If I can get by working 2 jobs that's good enough for me. but is it common for students to at least get a full tuition scholarship? Maybe I pay for my living on my own?",

They claim to meet all demonstrated need (and poor + minority is definitely helpful haha).\n\n[Check our their EFC calculator](https://www.bu.edu/finaid/aid-basics/cost-of-attendance/net-price-calculator/), in my experience it's pretty accurate for what they give for aid and reach out to the fin aid department definitely before you commit to BU!!!",

Either for international students or korean-americans, I want to know what the social life is like, if the clubs are interactive, if it is possibly stingy or \"toxic\" like other korean communities on college campuses.",

            "comment": "Uhm, as a BU alumni I can say there are two Korean groups on campus: BU KSA, which consists of second generation Koreans and people who are interested in Korean culture, and BU KISA, which consists of Korean international students. Both sides are very polarized and I say don't crossover/hang out with each other, as their backgrounds and upbringings are much different. If you want to hang out with people at BU KISA, you need to be fluent in Korean and understand Korean social dynamics. But if you are a second generation Korean and do not like the Korean social dynamics, then going to KSA is for you. I was a second generation Korean and was fluent in Korean/understood a lot of the Korean social dynamics, so I hung out with a lot of people at BU KISA and BU KSA. It was an interesting experience and learned a lot about Korean international students.",

Knowing how to use informal/formal speech when meeting and interacting with Korean international students and learning how to drink when an upperclassmen pours you a drink, etc. Although most BU students in general are wealthy, I would say most Korean international students are on the extremely wealthy side, which can be difficult to understand if you are a Korean American.\n\nFor example, a lot of Korean international student friends I had at BU in undergrad would fly back and forth from Korea and Boston in business class on Korean Air, which seemed absurd to me at the time. And a good majority of the Korean international students either attended international schools in Korea or attended very expensive boarding schools on the East Coast, so it's very different.",

It\u2019s complicated and stems from Confucianism since like BC times, where u respect elders and look out for youngins and stuff, but really got toxic gradually. You get the hang of it if you grew up and understand korean societal culture but if not it gets real tricky and can get u bullied\u2026which are some of the reasons of bullying in korean education and society in general.",

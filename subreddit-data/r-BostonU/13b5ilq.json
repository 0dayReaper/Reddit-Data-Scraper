    "postText": "I am very confused because the pass/fail website hasn't been updated to account for HUB change (yes i know its fall 23 but is it retroactive and continuing students can designate this semester as p/f for hub) but also to my understanding a designation for a pass/fail score wont harm your gpa, at least thats what my advisors said. but now im reading it and it says that a Pass\\* wont count to your gpa in ANYWAY, but a Fail\\* will bring down your gpa???? very confused on it because isnt the whole point of a p/f designation to protect your gpa because you might have done bad in the class and now you dont wanna screw up your gpa but a F\\* will be the equivalent of a regular F?? whats the point then \ud83d\ude2d",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm a rising senior studying sociology at BU. I am currently in the process of doing  \nresearch for my senior thesis in sociology, which is about \"Third  \nCulture Kids\" or \"TCK\" for short. The original term is \"used to  \ndescribe how those who do not fit into the culture of their home or  \nethnic background, fit into a new \u201cthird\u201d culture with other TCKs.\"  \nHowever, there are more identities that fall into this category, which  \nis what I am exploring through my research. If you feel what I have written below might apply to you, please fill out my survey and you might be eligible to do an interview and get a gift card!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Are you either bi- or mixed race or you have grown up in more than one  \ncountry during your developmental years? If you fall into either of  \nthose categories, have you ever felt confused about your identity? If  \nyou want to participate in a study and receive a $10 Amazon gift card,  \nfill out this survey.\"  \n\n\nSurvey link:  \n[https://forms.gle/C7UWuFVParwPznUBA](https://forms.gle/C7UWuFVParwPznUBA)",

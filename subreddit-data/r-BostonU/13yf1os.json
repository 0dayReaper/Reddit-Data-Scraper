If you're that worried about being able to \"be conservative\" at BU though, I'd reconsider whether this is a good fit for you. It's a big school so you'll undoubtedly have some people who share your values, but if you're looking for the majority or even half the student body to match your views, I'd consider looking at schools like BYU, or some southern schools. \n\nRegardless of where you go though, you will meet people who are on the opposite end of the political spectrum. Some of them will undoubtedly push back on your beliefs and hopefully some will cause a change. \n\nIf you've read this far and are thinking \"I'm just fiscally conservative,\" you'll be fine anywhere.",

Also, that letter President Brown sent after Dobbs v Jackson was a disgrace. The only good thing about this place would be you might eventually run into some other conservatives who have the same disdain for leftism as you do. There might actually be a silent majority who are extremely sympathetic to right-wingism. Nonetheless, I have to give credit that BU has made an amazing achievement at cranking out a 15% admissions rate and 1500+ SAT in average admissions, pandering to the rich (who probably went to a particular private school in Comm Ave or New Hampshire \ud83d\ude02) at the price of fucking over the lower/middle class. They then want the poor kids who are on full rides to thank them after begging badly for scholarship money. Also concealed carry on campus is prohibited, too bad if you were thinking your life is somehow worth defending. Good job, champs. It would be funny if it weren't so sad. \n\nDespite all this, I do think you should attend. Think of a hostile takeover scenario. Overturn the left-wing educational conspiracy. After the Supreme Court strikes down affirmative action, I would love to see a BU where the ultra-rich/international student body was reduced dramatically and we get a lot more representation from poor people of all races. Someone should then revive the TPUSA chapter that was shut down because the woke mob was uber-triggered about their mere existence. Don't worry, plenty of conservative orgs at SPLASH until then, which are growing in popularity every year. Did I mention that poor people at BU tend to have higher IQs than rich people? I wonder why!",

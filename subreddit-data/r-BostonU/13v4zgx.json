    "postText": "I'm a senior, graduating in Aug 23, and I'm currently signed up to be in Digital Photography in Summer II. However, I really wanted to be in Photography I. I've honestly already done many years of digital photography and would rather be in the darkroom developing photos.\n\nI signed up for digital photo because 1. I need uncomplicated credits to graduate and 2. I didn't think I'd have access to a film camera this summer but my friend is finally letting me borrow hers.\n\nSince both classes are full, I feel we could do a swap. If there's anyone in Photography I who doesn't care either way, or would rather be in Digital Photo, please PM me!! it would fr save my life.\n\nThank ya",

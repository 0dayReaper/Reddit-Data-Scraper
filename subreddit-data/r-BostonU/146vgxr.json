    "postText": "so for my financial aid i was selected as a university scholar which means i get full need  without loans. i was looking at my bill and the statements that were posted/pending and i don\u2019t think my scholarship has been applied. i do have one outstanding requirement that i have to complete on campus during my orientation this month. after that\u2019s completed will it change ? because the bill rn is not why i committed \ud83d\udc80 i\u2019m also seeing a bunch of fees on there like sports pass, community service, student services and don\u2019t know what they\u2019re for. should i call financial aid with questions or student accounting services ?",

            "comment": "ok so financial aid won\u2019t post until late june/july so we all have ugly bills right now \ud83d\ude2d you can click on the sports pass and reject it if you\u2019d like, it\u2019s just for sports games if you think you\u2019ll go to them often. community and student service fees are, to my knowledge, un-appealable bc i\u2019ve tried lol. if you want to get rid of the orientation fee you can also probably call financial aid/student accounting and tell them you can\u2019t afford it. if you have personal insurance that is comparable to BU SHIP (google the requirement list), ABSOLUTELY waive the insurance. you only have to do that once per year and it\u2019ll save you like $3k",

That one is optional but they put it on there so they can get the fees from the kids that don\u2019t know better.\n\nYou can request them to waive the health insurance because you can\u2019t afford your own or because what you may have does not meet their requirements.",

I have very limited prior programming/coding experience and so I'd rly appreciate any insight on whether DS 100 or DS 110 would be better. I will definitely put in lots of work into whatever class I take, but at the same time, I don't want to overwhelm myself in my first semester. I've been hearing conflicting things about the difficulty of DS 110 and so I'd appreciate any insight. Thanks :)",

            "comment": "Hey! Im a rising sophomore ds major. I kind of answered your question in a different post so I\u2019ll copy my response.\n\n\u201cAs a data science major with a few good friends also in data science, I\u2019d recommend not taking DS100. I personally didn\u2019t take it because of AP credit but most of my friends took it and told me it was a waste of time. I feel that I could have taken DS110 without any coding experience because of how much time is spent on learning python. DS110 is not a hard class at all, but 210 is a bit of a jump up in difficulty. Definitely talk to your advisor before locking in DS100.\n\n\u2026\n\nA little unrelated, but is there any reason you are doing data science over comp sci? It\u2019s good to have a solid reason to choose one over the other (not including reasons like \u201cI want to make money\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s a new major\u201d). At the moment, DS210 does not transfer over to CS112, so it would be annoying to switch to cs later on (though CS112 can count for DS210).\n\nhttps://www.bu.edu/academics/cas/programs/computer-science/ba/\n\u201c\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/13w51zb/is_it_ok_to_take_a_200_level_course_your_freshman/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=1\n\nI knew Java before college and DS110 was very easy. Python is one of the easier coding languages to learn. I\u2019d recommend signing up for DS110 initially and go to class the first week to check out the vibe. If it seems too hard, you can always drop it and take DS100 instead (there\u2019s an add drop period for about 2 weeks where you can drop classes without it appearing on your transcript). Hope this helps :)",

I was actually admitted to CAS, but I wanted to explore both CS and data science since big data does rly interest me, but I honestly am not familiar enough with either to make a decision right now. On the course registration planner it\u2019s showing CS 111 as blocked from registration because all the open seats are reserved. Do u know if it would be possible for me to still do CS 111, and add it during add drop period? Or is not likely that lots of ppl will drop. As I rly wanted to do CS 111 in my first semester so I can familiarize myself with the foundations of programming etc.",

So yes you can use that email for DS 110 questions. As for choosing between those two classes, I don\u2019t really know because I haven\u2019t taken 111. CS accepts 110 for 111 credit and the DS department accepts 111 for 110 credit so I\u2019m not sure how much it matters. 110 was not that hard though",

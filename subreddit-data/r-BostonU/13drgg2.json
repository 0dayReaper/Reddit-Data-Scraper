Also, I\u2019ve heard from a friend that obtaining an internship at BU is very difficult, but the workload/stress is better than GaTech. Please help, thank you.",

There are many people in the real world from both schools who got a great education and have good professional careers because of it. What you do with your education and how you prepare yourself to enter the professional world is largely up to you no matter where you go. There are too many variables to even start thinking about what one friend said about their internship experience. I had friends at BU with a completely different experience.\n\nSo my advice, as an older dude who was also deciding between BU and GT for engineering at your age, is that you're thinking about the wrong things.\n\nThe schools could not be more different in terms of culture and atmosphere. \n\nGT is in a city but is a more secluded and confined campus, the weather is different, the student body is much different (obviously more southern people), football and greek life are a huge part of the social scene. \n\nBU is spread out among the city and your lifestyle will become more integrated with it. It gets cold, there are more people from northern states, sports don't dominate the culture as much although hockey is the sport of choice over football, greek life isn't very prominent.\n\nIf you haven't visited both I suggest spending a weekend at each one and getting a feel for the vibe and campus and try to picture where you see yourself fitting in more. \n\nI ultimately choose BU because I'm from Connecticut so it was closer to home and I felt like the campus and lifestyle just suited me better as a person.\n\nI graduated in 09 and I can tell you that what you will remember most about college is the friends you made and the lifestyle you lived. Both schools can lead you to a very nice career if you put in the work. So try to put that aside and think about where you really feel you belong.",

What department is he in? Maybe his department doesn't do the same thing but if you ask your academic or career advisors they would help you fs with that, I wonder if he did not did not do that.\n\nAlso I feel like the onus is on the individual to find their own internship instead of having the school do it for them cause that sounds weird to me. I went directly on the websites of places I wanted to intern and I did stuff through there, I never did anything through the school.\n\nAre you talking about an internship during summer or during school? People don't usually do summer internships in the same city they study cause that is honestly kind of boring and people want to see new places. If you're talking about internships during school I would say those are rare and of limited use. You're in school to study so you should take as many classes as you can and study; you can do internships on your own free time in summer and not interfere with your academic life which is way more important to jobs/grad schools than any internship you can get.",

    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nI committed to transferring in to BU for Fall 2023, and I have a couple questions regarding the process of transferring in.\n\nFirstly, I am interested in switching my major prior to starting. Can I do that, or will I have to stick to my old major?\n\nCAS EC 101 and 102 are pre-requisites to the IR major at BU- but I am transferring in credits that are beyond these courses, and I only have credit for 102 and not 101. Can I take CAS EC 101 while taking higher courses?\n\nThanks!",

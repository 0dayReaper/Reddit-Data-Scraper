    "postText": "Alright, so here's what happened. I want to try and keep some details vague for the privacy of this person/myself for (imo) pretty obvious reasons. Earlier this week I sat down to take my final exam. It was the usual deal for exams here: everyone sits down, stays quiet, and the professor tries to have everyone be decently spaced apart. I came into the exam a little early and took my seat near the back. The exam started without a hitch, and everyone was totally quiet.\n\nNeedless to say, I was a little nervous. This was my final exam, the adrenaline was pumping, and as I'm sure a lot of you know, you're just anxious to see what the hell is on the exam. Fast forward, maybe 20 minutes. Usually when I'm stressed, I can get a bit bloated, and to relieve it, my body lets slip some toots. I am a little ashamed of this, especially because it had to happen during an exam, but I feel that it happened naturally.\n\nThere was a guy sitting near me, and I'm pretty sure, although not certain, that he heard my little toot. He started laughing. Like uncontrollably. To be fair to him, he was trying to stay quiet, but another student nearby looked up from her exam and gave him a pretty angry look. She ended up calling one of our TF's over, and after a brief conversation, the TF went to our professor. Our professor made a general announcement just to remind everyone to try and keep noise to an absolute minimum. We all went back to our exams. Maybe 15-20 minutes later, I accidentally let slip another toot. In the guy's defense, I think this one totally caught him off-guard because he made an audible laugh. Like a literal laugh-out-loud, and got some of the students in front of us to turn in their seats.\u00a0\n\nSure enough, our professor comes down the aisle and asks him to please leave. He's obviously freaking out now and turns in my direction, I think hoping I give some explanation. The same girl says to the professor, pretty loudly, that he's been giggling for a lot of the exam. The guy insists he's not doing anything, and I ended up not speaking up. A part of me feels bad for this guy, but I also can't help but feel like it was deserved. Specifically, he's one of those guys, the typical wealthy-white-frat-clones that are here on their dad's hedge fund money. Of course he didn't totally deserve it, but he probably felt so entitled that he thought he could lol in the middle of an exam. I know this last part includes some of my personal beliefs but I wanna put everything on the table. \n\nAITA for not speaking up to help this guy out?",

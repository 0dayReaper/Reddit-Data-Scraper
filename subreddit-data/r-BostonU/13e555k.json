    "postText": "Edit: no longer available\n\nI'm looking for a female to sublease a **furnished, spacious room** in a 6B2B apartment at Euston St (Brookline) for **$750 per month**. There's **in-unit laundry and A/C**. You'll be sharing the room with one other female as a double. You\u2019ll be taking the queen size bed. It takes under 5 minutes to get to the BU Charles River campus, Green Line B at BU Central and C at Saint Mary's St. There are also a lot of restaurants nearby. It's also within a short walking distance to Target. This place is extremely affordable at a fraction of the BU's housing costs while offering the same proximity and convenience as BU dorms! DM for more information as soon as possible. (Move-in date negotiable - **willing to do just summer 2**)",

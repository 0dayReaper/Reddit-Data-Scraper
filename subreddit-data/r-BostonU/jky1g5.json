He walked into the white leaving Rich Hall. He realized Nickerson was naked, missing a shaft and two balls. He quickly scampered down, didn't care if he was late. WR101 would just have to wait. He scurried around, making a dick. He made sure the balls were large and the shaft was thick. Once he was done he sprinted to class, only to realize it was Wednesday and he actually had Math.",

    "postText": "Hi, incoming freshman (class of 2027) here, any help is appreciated!  \n\n\n1. BU ID# - online it says for course registration I need to know the last digit of my BU ID for my start time to register for courses but I have yet to receive my BU ID\n2. AP Credit - I have taken lots of APs this year that I should get credit for when I enter BU (Im pretty sure I got the 4s and 5s I needed), and when signing up for courses I dont want to sign up for the classes I think Im going to place out of so can I just sign up for other classes instead?\n3. Course Registration Red Flags - on most of the classes I want to sign up for in the course planner, they have red flags next to them. Any chance that during my registration time I will be able to sign up for these specific classes?\n\nThank you for the help and I know it all seems really specific but I feel like BU doesnt do the best job helping out their incoming freshman with this portion of the job.",

Registration time is also available on StudentLink, no need to know ur ID for that.\n2. Yeah just skip the classes that u think u can place out.\n3. Red flag could be either reserved seats or class full, u gotta check the number of remaining seats. Certain major (CS) restrict registration access now so there could also be red flags.",

            "comment": "Freshmen will not be beginning registering for a few weeks, and all of this will be covered during orientation. If you do not have the info yet, then it is not time to do those things yet. Regardless, not sure what you have complete access to yet, but if you have student link:\n\n1. You can find your BU ID in several places. 1. In Student Link on your degree advice report. 2. In Student Link under academics -&gt; Transcript Preview and Ordering -&gt; then go to view the preview and click show name/ID. Once you get your U ID, memorize it ASAP lol. Also to find your registration time you only need to see student link under registration, fall 2023, then the time it says registration opens is your personal time. Freshmen do not typically register at their start time before they get any guidance or information since that might not be a smart idea.\n2. Use your best judgement for whether you think you will get a 4 or 5, use the [AP credit guide](https://www.bu.edu/admissions/files/2018/06/Advanced-Credit-Guide.pdf) to determine what you get credit for (make sure to send in your scores too!!). You can always level down if you end up scoring lower than expected. You know yourself best, so register based on what you expect.\n3. Freshmen in particular are blocked from lots, but there are other limitations. Flags are placed if there are no open seats, or if the professor has a personal waitlist. Many classes are flagged to save seats for specific majors, and there are classes you need permission to get into. You might not be able to register for these classes, and this is a good lesson in selecting backup classes which students of all years need to do haha. It is very difficult to get into specific competitive classes and you are not guaranteed to get what you want.\n\nLmk if you have any other questions! but seriously, you do not need to be worrying about this stuff yet!! BU will communicate when it is time to deal with these things :)",

I do know that you will be given all of the guidance you need during orientation, and I'm not sure how students are expected to use Student Link without any help (the site sucks). The Student Link registration system DOES become available to freshmen on June 1st, you are correct, but it remains open until a few weeks into September (plenty of time, does not mean that June 1st is \"registration day\" for freshmen). BU's communication can def get frustrating but feel free to DM me if you have any questions if you want to try registering/picking your courses before orientation. I am in CAS too and have lots of experience dealing with registration bs lol",

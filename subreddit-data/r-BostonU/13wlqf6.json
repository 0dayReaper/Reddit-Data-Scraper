And on the course registration planner, there's a CDS 110 A1 that happens thrice a week and a CDS 110 A4 that only happens once a week. Does anyone know what the difference is between them? They're both with prof Gold. Thanks :)",

            "comment": "Hi! Are you a CDS student? If so, I have heard people say it is possible to go straight to 110 without coding experience, but I would definitely be cautious. It is technically recommended that you should take DS 100, and be aware that everyone else in the 110 class would be at a different starting point than you, but honestly, learning a coding language on your own is an important skill for anyone going into tech field... I HAVE heard some people say that 100 is too easy and is def skippable for anyone. If you think you would be able to put extra effort into keeping up with the class, go for it! You know yourself best! Might be helpful to learn some Python ahead of time on Code Academy or some other free site this summer though (Google \"learn Python online free\" lol)\n\nAs for the different sections (sections are A1, A2, A3 of the same class), in many courses, you are expected to register for one lecture AND one discussion. Student Link will alert you if you are missing a discussion / lab after you officially register, but just note that you will need to register for the lecture A1 AND either A2, A3, A4, or A5. So for DS 110, you will register for 2 sections.",

I\u2019m not a CDS student, I\u2019m actually in CAS but I\u2019m considering transferring to CDS and so my advisor told me to look into the data science courses. I\u2019ll definitely look into DS 100 as I know that I\u2019ll put in the extra work required for DS 110, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to overwhelm myself in my first semester. Does DS 100 include programming, and some of the basics to coding?",

My understanding is that DS100 talks about data science and what it is and why it is important, while DS110 starts teaching the real core of data science. I don't personally think it would be too much to take DS110, but it is def up to you and what you feel comfortable with. Though, if you are interested in PROGRAMMING, I would recommend CS 111 (I took it and it is a great and in depth intro to Python), but if you just want to learn more about what the CDS major / field entails, start with a CDS class of course.\n\nAs a note, the college of data science is brand new... Like it literally did not exist when I first came to BU. As a result the program has not been thoroughly tested, as in no one has gone freshman -&gt; senior and graduated as a CDS major and there are only a handful of alumni. That being said, it is getting a lot of attention and money at this time since it is fancy and fresh and has a cool new building. Def worth looking into, and lmk if you have any other questions or anything!!",

How maths heavy was CS 111 and was it very fast paced? Also, it seems like ur a CS or DS student - and so I was wondering, how much calculus do you use and need in upper level classes? Or is it more CS specific maths/ stats that you learn and use.",

It is a really well designed class and the professors are great! I came in with no cs experience and just wanted to try it out, and enjoyed that class so much I decided to major in it. CS112 is a different story lol, it's pretty challenging... CS111 is paced pretty moderately, but the problem sets do take a good amount of time to complete (which is the case for all upper level cs classes tbh).\n\nThere is basically no calculus is any CS class I've ever taken. A few classes like CS132, CS235, and CS237 are essentially math classes that use programming, but those are things like probability and linear algebra, no calculus.",

Would I be able to get them if ppl drop later? And if I do DS 110 but then find it rly difficult, would it be possible for me to switch to DS 100? I\u2019m so sorry for asking so many questions, but how do you find the grade deflation in CS? Thank you so much for all the help!!",

Your best bet is contacting your advisor if you don't get in to the classes you want or emailing the professors asking if they have a personal waitlist or openings in the class. Also, it is important to keep your plans flexible, as you can always take a class at a later date. Note that there is LOTS of movement at the beginning of the semester approaches. People move into and out of classes daily, so if there is an opening you can snatch up a seat when a student drops it. Just keep your eye on student link. You can absolutely switch up or down in level if you feel like something is not a good fit. You can add classes until September 18th, and it is really normal to switch classes up until that date.\n\nMost of the grade deflation concerns come from new students, I think it is mostly a myth. What is true is that there are very difficult classes in the CS department, and professors must curve UP to get a B average course grade. I took a class where a 75% was an A and a 50% was a C because the class average was so low. They don't hand out A's for free, but they won't give you a C+ if you scored a 94% average if that makes sense. As long as you put in the effort you need to, take time to study, do the homeworks, go to office hours, ask questions, and get help when you need it, etc etc etc, then there is absolutely no need to stress about grade deflation! Hope this helps and do not hesitate to ask any other questions, I'm always happy to help!!",

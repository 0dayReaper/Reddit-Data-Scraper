Tons of restaurants and quick places to eat. Few clubs and music venues. The area is essentially all BU and some BC students. Commonwealth ave (\"comm ave\") is the main road through campus, with good bike lanes and big sidewalks.   \n\n\nThose buildings on Comm ave are good, those units are pretty standard. They are geared for students and will have everything you need. Some units are renovated differently from others but they are generally all similar.   \n\n\nAnd sorry but I'm too old and busy to check out the unit for you.",

You likely wont her the words of your neighbor\u2019s conversations but may hear that they are talking. Easy to hear their TV or music. Headphones are your friend. Try to get a unit at the end of the building if you can, away from stairways/garbage shoots/laundry rooms. Ceilings tend to be bad too, hear your neighbor\u2019s foot steps.\n\nOnly the higher end buildings have better sound insulation. Still, all apartments will always have some bleed through.\n\nI dont think this is an Allston thing, just an apartments in old, big cities thing. Many of these apartments were crammed into nice old buildings with little care for things like sound proofing.",

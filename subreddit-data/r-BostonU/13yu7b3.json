I took AP Calc AB in my junior year of HS, so I'm a pretty rusty on a bunch of Calc concepts. Should I take MA123, or is it easier to self-study Calc and just skip to CS131?",

Any calculus concepts you run into are easy enough to learn without taking an entire course and will likely be retaught anyways. Who's gonna remember calc from freshman/senior(HS) year when they're a junior or senior taking a high level CS class?",

I will say that both classes are a lot of work, especially CS131 but it\u2019s definitely doable. \n\nMA123 is a piece of cake compared to CS131, so if you REALLY wanted to, taking CS111 and MA123 at the same time is not difficult at all. CS classes usually have long problem sets you need to complete each week, so I definitely spent a lot less time with MA123\u2019s work.",

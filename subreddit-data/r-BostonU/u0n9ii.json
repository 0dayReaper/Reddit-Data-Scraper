You earned your space in that classroom and that conversation was better for you explaining the realities of navigating those systems.",

The guilt of wasting food is far too much for me to handle.\n\nI depended so much on the services provided to me for free in middle and high school. BPS provided free lunches and MBTA access to all students, regardless of financial status. That was great for my parents who needed to spend time working, so they couldn't make meals for me or take me to and from school. now I'm in a super expensive private school, honestly don't know how I'll deal with student debt after graduating. :/",

They just assume everyone has money. That doesn\u2019t help the fact that it feels like shit that you can\u2019t afford anything lol",

When I went with him to meet his friends back home, his friend\u2019s mom told me \u201coh you got a good one there. You did well\u201d. I didn\u2019t really understand it then until his friend apologized to me. That\u2019s when I realized that she was hinting that I netted a golden goose.  It was one of the strangest things I have ever experienced but I never let any of it stop me from speaking my mind and doing what is right. \n\nLife is life. It\u2019s about what you do with it. There are great ppl on either side of spectrum. Associate yourself with good people and don\u2019t segregate yourself just because of feeling self conscious.  People are people. There are many born in wealthy family but decided to take none of that money to make something of themselves. Be brave and be you. You would be surprised by all the interesting people you meet. Life is an adventure, you are only limited by your willingness to explore.",

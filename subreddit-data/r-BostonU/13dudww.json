    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nDo you guys like to keep up with the latest sports news, but find it hard to keep up with headlines outside of what is popular on social media? I've created a simple solution!\n\nI used Python to program an email newsletter that gets sent out automatically every morning at 9 am with the latest headlines from [nfl.com](https://nfl.com/) and [nba.com](https://nba.com/) in a bulleted format. This newsletter allows you to easily keep up with important NFL and NBA news during the process of checking your mail in the mornings, which is much more convenient than having to visit [nfl.com](https://nfl.com/) or [nba.com](https://nba.com/) on your own and navigate through the website. If you wish to be added to the mailing list, you can submit your email address through the following Google form: [https://forms.gle/RFiQRunb7Z94o4w19](https://forms.gle/RFiQRunb7Z94o4w19)\n\nYou can also submit feedback/suggestions through that same form, and please leave any comments/questions on this post.\n\nHere is a sample screenshot of what the email would look like in your inbox (partially shown; need to scroll to see beyond the screenshot):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/30ks3j4fx0za1.jpg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6eb5f5d20c72de43eaf4d2f36ddda97e599f0ac9",

    "postText": "BU is a mentally challenging school and very much so, especially socially. The environment there is not as welcoming as people say it is. In the 2 years I have been there my depression has gotten only worse and it doesn\u2019t seem to improve. The people at BU are not welcoming and you should be very careful about who you talk to and always be prepared for a life of lonliness.",

Personally I have found 95% of people to be very welcoming and I and most people I know here have had amazing experiences (and most negative experiences have been due to one-off individuals who do not reflect the rest of the student body). Either you have not talked to enough people or you have been unlucky enough to encounter the minority who are assholes. I hope things get better for you. If you stick it out, make sure you reciprocate others' efforts to hang out, and are somewhat outgoing and friendly you will find your people eventually.",

BU is a big school in the middle of a big city with a bunch of other schools, so it's hard to feel like you're part of something. As someone who's pretty introverted, this was real hard to deal with.\n\nI have some advice for you:\n\n\\- If you have the opportunity, seek professional help. After being diagnosed with GAD and MAD, my life changed for the better. I'm still not at a point where I can say \"My social life is exactly how I want it\" (I wish I had more and closer friends :/ ), but it's better because I'm working on it. Idk if you've been professionally diagnosed, but if not I'd recommend it because the diagnosis report is v informative. You may learn something important about yourself you didn't know. Also, therapy is v helpful.\n\n\\- Some people are judgmental. Avoid them; they do not understand you and will never try to.\n\n\\- This is disgustingly corny, but you really do have to put yourself out there with confidence. This means recognizing that you have to be honest with yourself about where/how you could improve. Take the summer to reflect on what you want, then take a different approach this fall. You have to carve out your own space rather than \"fit in\"\n\n\\- Life is supposed to \\~flow\\~. When something's not flowing, either work on it or drop it. It didn't hit me until a few months ago how short life is. V motivating.\n\nmy DMs are open!! Sorry this was long  lol",

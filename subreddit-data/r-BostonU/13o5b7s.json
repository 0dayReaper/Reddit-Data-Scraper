    "postText": "The idea that because some guy (which most of you had never even heard of until a couple weeks ago) did something shitty does not somehow give you license to deprive others of this momentous point of personal achievement \u2014 and the fact that there are people out there that believed that they were morally justified in robbing this day from so many people is a product of pure delusion. \n\nWhat was supposed to be a celebration of academic achievement and personal triumph was instead a total circus. You achieved nothing, and stole from those who had done no wrong. You can virtue signal all you want, but in the end you\u2019re no better than Zaslav. \n\nThe plane was a good touch tho \u2014 I\u2019ll give brownie points where they\u2019re warranted.

If anything it was the best part of the ceremony, it was super boring before this. Hearing that clown speak after seeing all the great people that would have been far better choices go on stage before him just made BU's decision seem worse.",

BU hosted events all week &amp; weekend for you.\n\ncommencement is a big moment but once you enter the real world, more often than not you\u2019ll realize people like zaslav are crooks making their fortunate off the hard work other people do. it\u2019s rightfully infuriating.\n\nBU had a huge spotlight on it today and this was a historic moment. everyone is apart of the history of it and it\u2019s your choice to be self important or support your fellow worker.\n\nedit: i don\u2019t mean \u201cyou\u201d as in u/mirescent! i\u2019m using it generally speaking.",

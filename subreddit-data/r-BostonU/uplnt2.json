    "postText": "We are Georgia Dray\u2019s mom and dad. Today we packed up our daughter\u2019s room for the very last time to move her home.\n\nWe are so incredibly touched that the residents of 195-197 Bay State took the time to express their love and support for us, and for Georgia, in a beautiful card. Your words mean the world to us. We only wish you could have had the chance to know Georgia fully\u2014the vibrant and loving young woman who was full of joy, loved to joke, and cared deeply for her friends and family.\n\nMental illness and brain disorders are nothing to be ashamed of, and we have always been, and remain, incredibly proud of our Georgia. She accomplished a great deal, even when she was struggling the most.\n\nThank you, Residents of 195-197 Bay State Rd for being a friend to Georgia. We are forever grateful to you.\n\nWe love and miss our sweet girl, and are devastated by this loss. Our lives have been completely shattered. But our hope is that anyone who is hurting will remember\u2014you are loved and you are worth finding help. And for those who are doing alright\u2014be kind. Take the time to reach out to others. You never know what someone might be battling.  Xo",

Though we didn't get to know each other too well because of covid, we all kept contact as a floor through text and GroupMe. She was so kind, always letting us know when our packages showed up and offering us cookies too. I am so grateful that our paths crossed and that I got to say hi to her and Buddy every day\u2764\ufe0f",

I hope that you all will find some solace in the fact that we all support you and wish for the best.\n\nIf only we could have gotten there sooner, but we'll keep her in our memory even if we didn't know each other personally.",

Though almost everything was online that year, the people in that course were pretty comfortable with each other and we often maintained a kind of banter with each other each class session. Georgia was an integral part of that dynamic \u2014 so thoughtful and I always liked getting to talk with her. She was deeply intelligent and authentically kind and cared deeply for her family (and Bella and Buddy of course.) I am so grateful that we crossed paths. I can\u2019t imagine what it must be like to feel loss like this and am sending you both love.",

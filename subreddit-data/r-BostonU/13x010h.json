Also dual enrolled at a community college and had a 4.0 there. Female if that matters. \n\nPast year college was tough \u2014 family directly affected by the situation in Ukraine, lost a lot of my drive from the school I was in, sitting on a 3.3 cumulative GPA after this semester.\n\nI didn\u2019t include anything about Ukraine in the app as I\u2019ve always been hesitant to speak on it to college officials etc. \n\nAm I doomed?  Will things smooth over?  Should I show up and beg?",

It sounds like you are more than qualified you just had a hard semester and it won\u2019t hurt your application to clarify that you think thats an important insight into who you are as an applicant. (Accepted with 2 transfers and failed out of one school due to similar issues. I wrote why and showed a redemption arc. You need to just flip that)",

I didn\u2019t want to put anything down initially from a whole lot of guilt/thinking I\u2019m \u2018abusing the system\u2019 but counseling helped with that.  Just as an update to the post I called admissions and they put a note down on my application, will be further submitting a more detailed explanation from myself.",

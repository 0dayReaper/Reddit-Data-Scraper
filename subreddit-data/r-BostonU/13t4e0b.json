    "postText": "Hey, I am an incoming freshman from Turkey. I am very excited to join to the BU community this fall. \n\nI have few questions and concerns about the tuition and other international payments. \n\nHow exactly does international transactions work? Some people in my country have been talking about some struggles in the process of sending money abroad. \n\nIf there is anyone with some experience in this (especially Turkey specific) please reach me out.",

            "comment": "I am from India, and I struggled too. \n\nI had to use my Indian credit card to make payments on which the bank and fly wire charged a 5-10% fee. \n\nIt was terrible and very expensive until I became a part time student and I was able to pay with my US credit cards. All I had to do then was pay 1-2% for converting my INR to USD at a bank in India and then simply deposit the money in my bank here in US and pay the credit company. \n\nThis also helped my build a credit score early on. \n\nDM me if you need more information.\n\nEDIT - it\u2019s about to become worse for Indian students because the Indian government will start charging 20% for any outward remittance transactions, even credit cards. (Thankfully, I graduated in January)",

            "comment": "You can use flywire that is an international payment mechanism partnered with BU for international student payments. Flywire will give you multiple options on rates in your local currency from various banks and then take care of the rest. You need to wire the payment to them first. I\u2019ve used it multiple times.",

U have to take Wr120 and EK125 so your other two classes depend on your specific major. Its not that scary and you can plan out your schedule so you see what it can look like on studentlink.",

If you\u2019re in CAS and not a native speaker of another language, look up language requirements - can fulfill this requirement at any time - but nice to get out of way, especially if you learned a foreign language in high school\n3. Look up requirements for major and take one of principle courses\n4. Hub or other major course",

If you have AP credit for say math or physics, maybe chem depending on which engineering, but you could move things up. I wouldn\u2019t worry about HUBs during your first year as it\u2019s built into your schedule for you to complete them. For WR120 choose something that interests you or else it\u2019ll be really boring. EK 100 isn\u2019t a graded class so I wouldn\u2019t worry about that too much, it a class to help you succeed in college and in engineering specifically.\n\nWhich engineering are you?",

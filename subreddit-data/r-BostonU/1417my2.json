Prior to the layoffs, entry SWE at FAANG was $120k/yr+. Startup positions might be at the $60k+/yr. But hiring is slowing down, the candidate pool is more experienced and competitive than ever with so many recently laid off, that compensation may drop if employers decide to penny-pinch.\n\nReally tough to say what the job market will look like in a year (or three).",

                            "comment": "Internships are key. Some companies evaluate internships as years of experience, others don't. I had ~1.5 full years worth of internships when I switched to full time so I was able to get hired at an SE2 level and was promoted to SE3/senior after a year and a half.\n\nI had not interned at my company before getting a full time offer. Returning to companies you interned at has some tradeoffs. There's less ramp up time when you go full time which means you can get promoted a lot faster, but a lot of companies have a policy where former interns *have* to return as an SE1/entry-level if they return regardless of performance, so you have to go through a full promotion cycle and can't skip over any levels even if you were a prodigy. I believe Toast is like that, where I know people who should have returned as SE2s but they had to spend a year as an entry level SE1 at significantly lower pay as a formality because they were previously an intern. \n\nUnrelated to comp, but I would still suggest trying to return to a company you interned at if you enjoyed it. The team you join is way, way, way more important than overall company culture. I've worked at companies where I've been on two different teams and absolutely loved one but absolutely hated the other. I've also worked at companies where I hated the actual company/execs but I loved the job because my team was great. You don't really know team culture until you're already working, so if you interned with a team you like then it's nice to avoid rolling the dice on a new team.",

Wanna move to the US or Canada. I'm looking forward to doing masters there in cybersecurity but all the uni fees and other costs of moving/living out there is a heavy investment.

They usually give you one lump of shares with a large value (e.g. $320k) that vests over 4 years, so in my case I get the equivalent of an extra $80k/yr in company stock. I hold onto it in hopes that my company grows because I'm young, have high risk tolerance, and can more than easily survive on the base salary. It hasn't raised yet because the overall economy dropped when I joined, so my total compensation has actually decreased quite a bit. If I joined the company at the \"right\" time (6 months earlier or later) I'd be making closer to $350k total. \n\nMy username's a little misleading, I was born in the US. I work with someone in a similar situation who got his bachelor's in his home country (third world country in Africa) and moved to the US to get his masters. He's now making way more than me. Don't go into deep debt for your masters. Get scholarships or go somewhere cheaper. I never even finished my bachelor's so I don't have much more advice on that front.",

    "postText": "Hey, I hope you're all doing well! I'm excited to start my journey at BU this fall, but I'm in a bit of a housing dilemma. I'm looking for some guidance and potential roommates in the BU area.\n\nHere's a little bit about myself: I'm a 23 M from India. I'll be starting the MS Bioinformatics this Fall at BU. I'm friendly, responsible, and always up for a good chat. Since I'm new to Boston, I would love to find roommates who are reliable and interested in exploring the city together.\n\nIdeally, I'm looking for housing options within a reasonable distance of BU's campus. It would be fantastic to find something affordable, but I'm open to exploring various price ranges. I'd appreciate any suggestions or advice regarding the best neighborhoods or apartment complexes near BU.\n\nAdditionally, if anyone is also on the lookout for roommates or knows of any potential leads, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I believe it would be great to find individuals who share a similar mindset and if at all you have any recommendations or personal experiences related to housing near BU, whether it's about apartment hunting, reliable websites, or any other relevant information, please share your insights. I'm all ears!\n\nThanks!!!",

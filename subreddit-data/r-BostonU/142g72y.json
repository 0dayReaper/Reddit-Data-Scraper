    "postText": "I'm an incoming sophomore transfer student and I was just budgeting expenses for the fall semester and I was looking at room prices. I'm currently in a group with 2 other roommates and we are aiming for a suite with 3 singles. I was checking the prices and I know we cannot be placed in Stuvi because we are incoming students so I ruled out that option out (correct me if I'm wrong). I have a tight budget but I can make it work to get a single if I have enough time to plan, so I wanted to know how likely it is that my group gets a suite with 3 singles (and if there's the possibility we get it at Stuvi)  \n\n\nNote: In my group, we are 2 sophomores and 1 Junior, if it matters.",

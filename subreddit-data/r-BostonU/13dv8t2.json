    "postText": "Just recently took the cs112 final and those questions had me twisted, I left a question blank for the last part, and I feel sick to my stomach, I don't even know if I did average, but I'm rlly hoping I did, cuz this damn final is worth 40% and God I really don't want to fail this class. I was up all night studying, and I don't even know if it paid off, simply crying throughout this exam. my psets are 90% and my midterms is like 70%, but I'm sick, cuz this one final can easily destroy everything I worked for",

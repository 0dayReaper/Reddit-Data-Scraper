    "postText": "Hi , anyone else a senior who is barely graduating with no friends ? It seems like everyone is out right now having fun celebrating and I am in room alone not able to function. I have been on decline and ready to get out of here before more damage to me is done . Each year it gets worse and worse socially and academically I can\u2019t seem to get it together .\n\n\nI thought I had a job but what I thought u had fell though . The market is competitive for biotech. I have terrible stats . I can\u2019t seem to get it . I have to repeat some courses over the summer .  My family is coming next week for graduation and I am still trying to figure out how I am graduating . I still have exams to make up so I am just prolonging the suffering . It is hard to be positive and celebrate this occasion when there is so much uncertainty",

Everyone is posting their grad pics (which I didn\u2019t take), hanging out and celebrating with their friends (I didn\u2019t even go to senior events b/c no one to go with)\u2026 I just can\u2019t wait to explore what\u2019s out there post grad",

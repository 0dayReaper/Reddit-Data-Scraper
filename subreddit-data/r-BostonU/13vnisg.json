    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI was recently accepted into BU for Fall 2023 and am super excited to be joining. However, I am a little confused about what I should do for housing. \n\nI realllly want to live in the BU apartment style housing but it seems like most transfers get put into Danielsen. As I kinda want my own space and not in a big Hall, I am therefore thinking that I should go for off-campus housing instead. Since I am new to this, I have a few questions about off-campus housing and hoped you guys will be able to help a little bit with some of them! \n\nDo you think that it will be hard to find a nice apartment as most of them will have been taken already? \n\nWhere can I look to find the best off-campus housing options? \n\nWhere can I look for off-campus roommates? \n\nDo you think choosing off-campus housing as a transfer will make it difficult to make friends or is it not really that much of a big deal? \n\nWhat do you think are my chances of getting BU apartment style housing as it's my first choice? \n\nThanks for all your guys help!",

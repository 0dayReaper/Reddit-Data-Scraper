But the less processing in ingredients in Amy\u2019s made for a better pizza food coma than from Newman\u2019s. Newman\u2019s pizza food coma knocks you out cold, I think it\u2019s due to being slightly more processed the crust, but yes it was pretty delicious.",

The barbecue and chicken do not cook well with the cheese leaving you in a situation where you either undercook the chicken and the cheese does not melt in unison, or you overcook the hell out of the chicken but the cheese overcooked in some parts of the pizza and leaves the taste buds confused. Basically, that pizza does not cook well at all in the oven. I think that was my biggest problem with a lot of the pizzas with meat. You either overcook the hell out of the meat to melt the cheese nicely, or not overcook the meat, but some parts of the pizza become soupy. There was a lot that I learned from doing this pizza experiment.",

Came in clutch so I could sleep early without dealing with my next door suitemates being noisy\n\nYou probably don\u2019t need too many pajama / sleep shirts. You\u2019ll get some free shirts\n\nUmbrella - you preferably want to get it before it rains\n\nWaterproof kicks - ground is uneven here and you\u2019ll do plenty of walking.

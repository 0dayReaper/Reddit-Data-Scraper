    "postText": " Hi guys, I'm a sophomore studnet in rutgers, majoring in cs. Got the offer from boston university, wondering is it worth transferring to bu?\n\nI found the cs program is kinda the same level in two univeristies. So i'm jut gonna look at other factors.\n\nRutgers has been a comfort zone for me, and perhaps a bit easier academically. I'm concerned about the job opportunities available around Rutgers compared to Boston University. Additionally, I wonder if it might be more challenging to get into a good graduate school from Rutgers as opposed to Boston University.\n\nBu is more renowned and located in MA, which it likely has more resources for jobs and academics. On the other hand, achieving a good GPA could be harder at Bu, and there's uncertainty regarding my transfer credits.\n\nThe tuition fees, both universities have offered me a full ride, so I only need to consider expenses such as housing and food. It's possible that housing rent at Bu is more expensive, but that shouldn't be a significant deciding factor.\n\nHow do you guys think?",

            "comment": "Difficult to say, my thinking is that you want to choose the place that objectively sounds like a better deal/value for money, but also keeping in mind level of comfort/emotions around it. It seems like you\u2019re leaning towards BU objectively since you think there are better opportunities/more renowned program, plus since you have a full ride at both places (CONGRATS BTW) and since you don\u2019t think rent is a significant factor. Your heart may be leaning towards Rutgers since it\u2019s a point of comfort for you, which is definitely valuable. But if you believe you can overcome the obstacles of transferring, adjusting to academics, and meeting people at BU, then I could see you thrive here as well! Also I feel like grad school will be the same regardless of where you go, as long as you work hard during school and really show that you\u2019re ambitious and looking to do a masters in whichever field that is.",

            "comment": "I transferred here from Rutgers middle of sophomore year, I came here bc I really wanted to go to a big research uni but in a city. I also studied cs and math at Rutgers and happened to find professors that better inspired and helped further my academic career here. That\u2019s not to say u can\u2019t have that at Rutgers, every experience is truly what u make of it. I believe that it\u2019s what u r looking for in college, do u want to live in nb at a big state school or do u want to live in  Boston surrounded by tons of unis and students. Whatever choice u make, it\u2019s the best choice for u and we\u2019re all rooting for u! Good luck!!!",

    "postText": "I want to say I commend those who protested the ceremony in a respectful manner. Whether it be the plane, picketing outside, writing on your cap, a sign, or walking out during the speech.\n\nHowever, to the others who chanted and stood blocking others during the entire speech, you are selfish. Once would have been acceptable. Protesting injustices are important and it is great that we have to right to do so. i think the whole student body can almost agree David Zaslav was not a great choice as a speaker. However, he was set long before the WGA started protesting and by the time the strike started it was most likely too late to change speakers (due to contracts/ shortage of time). \n\nWhat those who stood and chanted throughout the speech fail to see is what they took away from the rest of their peers. Students who have spent 4+ years of blood, sweat, and tears (a lot of them) to receive a degree had their commencement tainted by the tasteless protest in the crowd. A day that should be for celebration of the work that each student put in devolved into students arguing back and forth in the crowd setting a negative tone on the whole event, at least for the area surrounding me.\n\nOverall, it was selfish to chant in the crowd and taint the day for all those who worked extremely hard for a degree. Pick a more tactful way to protest. Those who protested respectfully you\u2019re Awesome and thank you for respecting other students on ALL OF OUR DAY.",

What I remember is sitting with my best friends who helped me through the highs and lows of college. I remember my name being called at my department ceremony. I remember thanking the professors I love. University commencement is not as big of a deal as all the protest haters are making it out to be. A hear from now you won\u2019t remember the contents of Zaslavs portly written speech, you\u2019ll remember your time at BU, your friends, your profs, your dorms, etc. \n\nAnd you should be damn proud that your classmates had the confidence to stand up for what they believe in.",

I have the upmost respect for those who protested by walking out to make a statement. Even one chant at the beginning of the speech I would completely understand.  the way some protesters went about it was what was most frustrating about the whole thing.",

I could see your point if there were interruptions during other parts of the ceremony, but there weren\u2019t. The speeches before him, the awards afterwards, the final recommendations for graduation \u2014 they all went smoothly. I didn\u2019t hear about issues during school convocations either, which are what matter more anyway.\n\nThe point is, protesting isn\u2019t meant to be subtle and comfortable for everyone viewing. That would defeat the purpose. If you want to stay complicit and comfortable in your own little bubble, then I suppose you have the right to do so.\n\nP.S. I was in fact paying attention to his speech between heckles. It was pretty tone deaf and borderline offensive given the WGA strike. If you really wanted to listen to a rich old guy brag about his wealth and connections, more power to you I guess.",

Also, for you to say that their field not affecting your life makes it okay to not care if they make enough money to live or not is a really privileged take. You only care about workers who are essential to you? Crazy. It\u2019s basic empathy to care if people have enough to live. I also HIGHLY doubt you don\u2019t consume their content.

I said they are indeed workers and just because you don\u2019t think you need them doesn\u2019t mean they should not be able to afford food and rent. I\u2019m another comment on another post I also told you then you are not allowed any books, tv, movies, news, blogs, musicals, plays; u get nothing then fam. I expect you to stick by those principals and toss ur phone away. And also then I begged you to never hit post before you really got that noggin working. Did you miss that one? Try harder.",

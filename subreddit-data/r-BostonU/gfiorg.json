    "postText": "I just transferred to BU at the beginning of this semester (talk about *worst time ever* to try and start somewhere new!) because I was blocked out of biology classes at my old school. I chose Dan Dill's CH102 class from what scraps were left and moved on with my life, not thinking much of it. When I got to BU and started talking with students, however, I immediately became anxious about what CH102 would entail.\n\n3 50-minute lectures, 1 50-minute pre-lab lecture, 1 lab (on average \\~2 hours), 1 50-minute discussion session per week: attendance mandatory and recorded in all. You're telling me that I get the same number of credits for an anthropology class that meets twice a week for 75 minutes (all while it was canceled numerous times) as CH102? In **WHAT WORLD** is that acceptable? That is 6.5+ hours versus 1.5 hours just in the classroom **alone**!\n\nI've heard the following from numerous people, but I don't know how valid it is, so I'm taking it with a grain of salt: people have **killed** themselves over this class? Apparently that is the reasoning behind making the class 'easier' compared to other semesters, though this class was still ridiculously hard.\n\nStill, I know that the way this class functioned is unacceptable, regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic moving us to remote instruction.\n\nWhat the Chem department **needs** to do:\n\n1. Move on from setting up traps for students to fall into. What the actual fuck? I've seen the buzz about the glycerol problem, but I'm honestly petrified for those accused of cheating on the final that didn't. *How do you prove your innocence to the CH102 professors/Chem department that is practically running on the notion of guilty until proven innocent?* This shit has become a literal witch hunt, and it just adds to everyone's anxiety at the end of the day.\n2. Think about how we will actually be using Chemistry in our lives and making it far more pertinent to that/expanding our skillset. This kind of goes off of the previous point. I cannot name a single career path in which knowing how much energy it takes to separate a water droplet into smaller ones will set us apart from the crowd, let alone be applicable to literally anything we do.\n3. Offer extra credit for quiz review. I heard they did this in BI107. I'm sure saying the phrase \"extra credit\" around Dill and Abrams will make them break out in hives, but this is a great way to emphasize the importance of learning from mistakes. I can tell you that I was never in the proper mindset while I was in that dusty and decrepit auditorium taking the quizzes or at home in the middle of the night. Everything changes from when you were doing practice problems to prepare. Emphasizing the need to learn from mistakes will allow us to grow. **This is completely hindered when you are unable to see your graded final exam.**\n4. Apply the 75% clicker participation to all classes going forward. It honestly would break my heart a bit when I would see people run into Chem right after Dill closed the question. People are coming from all over to get to CH102, and to have a question due right at the beginning of class means that people have less time than they expect and an added pressure of getting to class to avoid lost points.\n5. Hire younger, newer, more inspiring, more energetic professors. There is no denying that they are out there. It pains me to know that I really could have even enjoyed Chem this semester if I had a good professor. A professor who is lively and present and you could hear in their voice that they wanted you to succeed. Someone like Spilios who is a ball of energy in the room with you. Not Dan Dill arrogantly saying that we have to pay attention to a certain type of problem/units/whatever because if he has to go to the hospital and you're working there, he wants to put his life in the hands of someone he can trust. (Get new jokes, bud. And stop fishing out of J.C. Penney clearance bins for your wardrobe.)\n6. Make discussion sections **useful** or don't hold them at all. Numerous times I asked the TA/TF/whatever they\u2019re called (I stopped going LOL \u2014 even after switching out of a section with an annoying one to get an *even* more annoying one) for the answers and they'd respond with something like \"Abrams wants you to figure out the answer on your own\". Okay, yes, but how am I going to arrive at an answer or make sure I'm doing things correctly with no direction? \"In your small groups\". Okay, and what happens when **all of us** have **no idea** if we are doing it correctly? Absolutely ridiculous. Discussions were a huge waste of time and most people there simply looked braindead from the weight this class carries.\n7. Get rid of pre-lab sections. Have Golger, or someone whose voice we can actually understand, record themselves explaining the lab/whatever and assign it to us to watch through Blackboard. Or better yet incorporate them into the lectures (this was also something I really hated about CH102 - it felt like everything was detached from each other at points, lab especially, and I had no idea how to tie it all together). I don't know about anyone else, but I relied solely on my lab manual to get me through and I was successful. I spent pre-lab online shopping for the most part and barely showed up because it was held at such an obscure, inconvenient time during my day. Quarantine definitely helped my lab grade, but I ended up pulling out a 95%, without ever listening to anything Golger ever said.\n8. Make all lectures T/R. M/W/F is fucking exhausting. It got to the point where I would leave Chem on Fridays and make myself happy with the thought of the fact that I wouldn't have to see Dan Dill on Saturday or Sunday.\n9. Be far more understanding. I heard that they failed a girl who missed last year's final for her father's funeral and the school didn't do **anything** for her so **she had to file a lawsuit**? **AGAINST THE SCHOOL SHE IS A STUDENT AT???** What the actual fuck??? The current pandemic has boldly highlighted the lack of empathy the CH102 professors have. They are truly emotionally detached creatures. I am lucky enough to live along the East Coast, so I never experienced a problem with time zones, but for the people that did, I am truly so sorry. I was fully expecting the quizzes to follow the format of the first one we had once BU was closed, which I respected at the time, but as time proceeded, everything became less and less flexible. We are in the middle of a **global pandemic.** Not everyone's first thought is CH102 (not that it ever should be LMAO). I saw it first-hand when Dan Dill scolded a student for asking for the clicker code because they joined class seven minutes after it began. They were helping their grandmother.\n10. Once again, give it the fuck up. BU is already ridden with grade deflation and the hardest finals in the country. To Dill, Abrams, and all other members of the Chem Creep Crew, **you will be paid the same salary whether you ruin the lives of your students or not. To make CH101/102 overtly rigorous strains the college experience we came to BU to have. To claim that the rigor is to \"weed out\" is unacceptable. Anyone should be able to explore their academic interests while at college, not having to worry about taking one of the most mentally manipulative courses out there. Stop playing God just because you all have superiority complexes and no lives outside of your careers.**\n\nI am thankful that CH102 showed me the strength I have within, though I wish that was done so under other circumstances. To everyone, in CH102 or not, be well, be strong, and be healthy. We've just finished one of the weirdest semesters ever. I hope to be back on Commonwealth soon.",

I don't know if anyone actually passed away during my freshman and sophomore year due to suicide, but there was an attempted suicide. A premed on my floor attempted suicide in her dorm room and rushed to hospital unconscious during my freshman year at Warren. There were multiple people trying to revive her until the ambulance came. I saw it with my own eyes (along with anyone else that came out of the rooms to see the commotion). She ended up eventually finishing the semester but she not return to finish her studies BU. I can also confirm that depression was specifically from this chem class, professor, and prehealth advising (there was a group of chem premeds from this class all living on this floor). I dont want to say more information than what is given here, but some of the older alumni of the class know the truth too. The premeds who remained at BU remained silent against admin for fear of repercussions future classes and med school admissions. This was not a rumor but a reality.",

Students were expected to solve logarithmic equations to find specific pH and pKa values by hand even thought none of the faculty really knew how to do this or could be bothered to learn. Tell me in what world that is a useful skill. One big reason this is happens is due to every pre-med being funneled through the course. The school wants to make sure only people who they are absolutely sure will be accepted in to med school apply so they create these weed out classes to cut the numbers of students. That intro chemistry sequence cuts about half of the pre-meds freshman year (don\u2019t even get me started on the pre-prof advising office)\n\nCH-109 and 110 are very difficult classes but worth taking imo. Unlike their ch-101 and 102 counterparts they are hard based on the material and not artificially extremely difficult.",

He has high expectation for his students because he genuinely believes in them. But he also thinks a 61% average grade on the final is good, which makes no sense but whatever. \n\nwhat I actually wanted to comment on was the mental health aspect and the lack of compassion during online school. \n\nLast semester in chem 101 I spent literally 37 hours STRAIGHT before a quiz studying and I got an 8/20. After the quiz I kept doing more problems so I could be on track with the class or whatever and I got stuck on a question and then just sat there feeling like the worlds biggest idiot because I worked so hard and literally passed one quiz the whole semester. It really tanked my self esteem and for a couple of weeks I unfortunately fell back into some old self harming habits :/ I was a 4.0 student in high school and I loved the sciences, and chem at bu made me hate the only thing I was ever passionate about. \n\nalso, that story about the clicker code and the kid who was helping his grandmother is absolutely fucked up. I had a similar situation where my grandmother was in the ICU dying a few weeks ago and she called me 3 minutes before chem lecture to say goodbye and I literally had to sit in a zoom chem lecture fucking clicking in answers while I was bawling my eyes out (thank Gd she made a MIRACLE recovery, but that day was an absolute shit show and I held so much hatred for the chem department since then). \n\noh, and is anyone gonna talk about how some people share chegg accounts?? Like me?? I let my friends use my chegg and they used it to cheat on chem and honestly good for them fuck chem but now I\u2019m gonna get fucked over ??? \n\nok that\u2019s all. Also congrats everyone on finishing this shit hole semester and a lot of y\u2019all on completing your first year!! \n\nto fresh starts &amp; no more gen chem! \ud83c\udf7b\n\nPs- be my friend!",

Also, I think leave the jc penny part off of this as well. \n\nThe only reason I say this is because I think you're message is extremely important and I just want BU to hear it without dismissing us because they think we are just complaining or making fun of professors. At the least they'll use it as a way to excuse the legitimacy of your points and avoid having to make a change. I'm sure they've heard legitimate complaints and student pain for years and look where we are now. \n\nSo never mind. Fuck you Dan Dill and your stinky dicked starch pants.

Where do most sophomores or transfers live and what buildings would you recommend?",

They\u2019re gonna place you wherever they have room and there\u2019s a 99% chance it\u2019s gonna be shitty. I wanted a nice dorm but I got stuck in HOJO when I transferred. And HOJO is gross and dark and scary.",

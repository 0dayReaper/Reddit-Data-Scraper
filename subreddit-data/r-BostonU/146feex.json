[Thousands](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65855608) of subreddits will be going offline for that period and millions of users will be logging off to demand change. I know that the audience of this sub might not directly affected by the recent changes made by Reddit, but removing 3rd party apps impacts [accessibility](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) for many people and the [behavior](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/145yrbe/whats_the_deal_with_someone_called_spez/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) of the CEO has been appalling. Reddit's changes are damaging and counterproductive.\n\nI have been using the 3rd party app [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/) since I was literally a kid and this is extremely frustrating. (For my CS classmates, Donham used Apollo too!!)\n\nThank you for reading this &lt;3",

Flights between cities range from inexpensive to expensive depending on where you want to go. My travel was restricted because of COVID guidelines still in effect but i managed to hit about six different places. I got really lucky with the group I was with and we all got along really well but I\u2019ve heard horror stories so it definitely depends on each semester. Let me know if you have more questions!",

It\u2019s a hierarchical structure in which there\u2019re some distributors at the top of the chain that are unique and all IPs are just more information tacked onto those.

They assign an IP address to your modem and you keep it for as long as it is uninterrupted, months even years. You can manually change your IP by turning off your modem long enough for the address to expire. Then you can turn on the modem and you will pick up a new IP address. The time it takes for the IP to expire varies between the ISP providers. You can also call them up and request a change. Once your IP address expires it will likely be assigned to someone elses modem within the same region. \n\nA VPN masks your IP by sending all your internet traffic through their modem first then after it traverses their modem it goes to your intended website. So if you go to google.com, your web browser goes to the VPNs modem first, then their VPN modem goes to google.com. So in this example, google.com thinks the request came from the IP of the VPN modem rather than your own. You can also use a proxy server for this, but the main difference is your traffic is not encrypted and the proxy services usually limit the type of content you can load.\n\nAlways use encrypted VPNs for anonymity. Pay for the service, its probably worth it.",

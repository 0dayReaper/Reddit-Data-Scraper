If you're looking into entertainment industry, I would think schools in NYC, LA, or Las Vegas make the most sense where establishing and securing connections is key to work in those fields and less so on credentials. BU being across the country would not be able to do anything for students wanting to be outside of their influence unless you knew someone that had some crazy pull out their ass. I'd think unless you went to the very top schools like Harvard or MIT, schools in Boston are mostly going to help in locating jobs in the northeastern region. Same thing with schools on west coast or anywhere else helping connect you with those specific regions",

These are issues which must be addressed now, and not later.\n\nAs a young person working in tech-- I strongly support this strike, and the student protest, because I can see what will absolutely happen in my lifetime. This is our first chance to address the impact this technology will have on all white collar jobs, and we must do it now. Doing it in 5, 10 years will be too late. It's incredibly important for my generation (which includes these students) to be pushing this conversation, and so I applaud their protest.\n\nTake some time to read up on what the writers are saying about the protest, you may find it enlightening.",

My answer is neither of those options-- my personal take is that the best possible case is one where technology means that we have enough that people don't need to work (or only need to work a little bit). And if people want to do engineering, art, whatever, they can still explore those things. So I'm not concerned about jobs being taken away, I'm concerned about jobs being taken away with no backup plan.\n\nWith the direction our technology is going, everyones lives could be so much easier! But, unfortunately, with the way our political and financial systems are set up, I'm worried that we're moving in a direction where people who can afford to run complex AI systems will singlehandedly profit while everyone else is left out. So that's what I think we need to address: how do we make sure that everyone can have food, shelter, opportunity, etc, despite the proliferation of these systems? I think UBI is the most practical answer, personally. So does Sam Altman (the CEO of OpenAI, which produces ChatGPT).",

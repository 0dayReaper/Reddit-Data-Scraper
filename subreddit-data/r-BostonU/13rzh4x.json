Jobs are simply a numbers game, keep applying to companies (on their website itself, NOT ziprecruiter/indeed, alot of the jobs there are old or fake). Once you have your first job, you're set.\n\nThe problem is that schools, especially schools like BU, trap you into thinking that grades/academics are all that matter in life. However, in reality, a degree is simply an asset that you use to make money. That's it. Complete your requirements and move on.",

But I somehow got into Harvard for grad school, graduated yesterday with my master's degree, and now I realize the worries I had were all for nothing back then. Not everyone's path after graduation is linear, but you managed to finish your bachelor's degree from Boston University, which is a heck of an accomplishment. So be proud!",

There is a deep and dark period when you rant at others for being morons and rant at yourself for being a failure. You need to go through this and then step up and out. You need to look at what you did and how to fix the bad habits and lackadaisical time management. Then start anew.\n\nAgain, I am truly sorry for what you are going through.",

    "postText": "As above. I know that apartment (854 beacon street) is close to BU but let me tell you this straight: run, do not stay there. \nThe apartment is bad, full of rats and insects; \n-maintenance man is bad, constantly entering my room without knocking, once he also entered my room at 6am, so fucking early, and didn\u2019t knock!! Not sure what\u2019s his problem there, probably he wanted to see me naked or sneak in my apartment to steal something? Entering my room to adjust the heater to an extremely high degree which resulted the electric bill to be 300 dollars. \n-My takeout and shopping kart got stolen there, people who live there are terrible. \n-The worst comes the worst is the landlord, Steve (Steven Handler), very poor communication skills and extremely rude (when I ask and discuss something with him, he immediately says no and interrupts my conversation, he love\u2019s interrupting people\u2019s conversation so much!  And he also gets mad for no reason at all, and starts shouting in the middle of the conversation), extremely racist (assuming every Asian students are international, he said to my American born Vietnamese friend \u201cwait you\u2019re not international students?\u201d, and he also said to me and my boyfriend \u201coh you guys are both international students and blablabla\u2026\u201d but my boyfriend is not). And extremely bossy and unreasonable, the old stove in the kitchen has been used there for years and broke down after two months that I moved in, and to quote him, even he says, \u201cthat stove sucks\u201d, but he then ordered the exact same sucky stove, and the new stove broke down in one day after the weird maintenance man stalled, and he never bothering fix that shit at all until the day I moved out, and then he asked me to pay for the new stove, but I didn\u2019t even use it! I just tried to turn it on and it broke down. And also he is extremely weird. He asked me if I want to be his daughter-in-law, and I was like, man you should know that I have a boyfriend and hate you, he also said to my friend with a finger pointing at him, \u201che is good kid, right?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cokay\u2026\u201d He loves making phone calls extremely early, like 6:20-ish, I have been constantly woken up by his phone calls or the maintenance man. \nAnd I have read all the comments about that place on google map, and all the other house-renting websites, all comes negative, so I\u2019m not the only one found him annoying, everyone hates him. \nAnyway, overall, do not stay in any apartments that are owned by Beacon Realty LLC(Steve).",

    "postText": "This first year writing class needs one more student to register for it so it can actually run in the Sum 2 period. \n\n\nThe topic is \"Linguistic Justice: A Buzzword or a Means to Tackle Inequity?\" It is being taught by Professor Ward, who's absolutely fantastic according to students who have taken her Linguistic classes.\n\nIt also counts as a single Hub credit for First-Year Writing Seminar, if you've missed it. In short, a pretty good offer.",

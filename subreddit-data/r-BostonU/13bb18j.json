I highly recommend watching her final review on BB. And I will probably post explanations for the practice final. If I end up making something rly quickly, I will post it. Good luck :)",

            "comment": "Also note*** TLDR: after you connect your diels-alder, If you have MULTIPLE chiral centers, you must do endo test. If you only have chiral centers from dienophile - do cis/trans test. If only chiral centers from diene, do in/out test. \n\nI need to specify: for diels alder, you DO NOT need to check whether it\u2019s endo If there are NOT any groups that are on sp3Cs from both the diene &amp; dienophile. If there is a group coming off the 1 or 4 position from the diene, &amp; you see other sp3Cs after you connect the diene with the dienophile, you must check for an endo product and do that whack test where you put them on top of each other. Diene\u2019s are (1,3) for diel-alder rxns. So if you remember that, that\u2019ll guide you for when an EDG is coming off of the 1/4 position. If it is branching off of the 3 position, you don\u2019t check for endo &amp; only check for stereospecificity relative to the dienophile &amp; vice versa. If the dienophile groups are attached on an sp3C, you look at whether it\u2019s cis/trans. If the diene is only on sp3C you do the in/out test.",

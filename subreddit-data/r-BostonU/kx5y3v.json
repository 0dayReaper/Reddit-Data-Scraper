    "postText": "Hello--first time posting in this subreddit. I received my Ph.D. from BU in 2019 and have been teaching as an instructor in the Writing Program there since 2014. I have loved learning and teaching at BU, but have been dismayed by how poorly they treat their faculty--poverty wages, no affordable insurance, no PPE during the pandemic, and so on. After this fall, after nearly 7 years of teaching at BU, I finally had to quit due to the simple fact that I cannot afford to be employed by BU anymore. Over the course of the Fall 2020 semester, I wrote this essay about my experiences and why I have to leave BU, trying to figure out this frustrating situation. I shared it with my students last semester and they were grateful to have the insider information about how BU operates as a educational institution. I thought this subreddit might appreciate reading as well. I have copied the entirety of the essay below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: BU has a demonstrable record of failing its faculty and devaluing the classroom experience for its students. \n\n\\-BU doesn't believe its teachers need living wages even amidst a pandemic and despite record fundraising and endowments. Or, in other words, students pay full price for classes taught by exhausted faculty who often live on publicly subsidized health insurance and work many other jobs to make ends meet. \n\n\\-In a moral sense, it's repugnant for other reasons: BU paid $13,000 in security fees for the right wing commentator Ben Shapiro to speak for one night on campus in the Fall of 2019 while also paying members of their faculty just $6,000 dollars to teach a semesters-long course. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nESSAY:\n\nNovember 22, 2020.\n\n**Post-Doc 2020**\n\nDr. Sam ShupeCollege of Arts &amp; Sciences Writing Program Boston University\n\nI am writing because I need to figure some feelings out. First, I feel embarrassed. I must quit my beloved job teaching at the elite private research university where I earned my Ph.D. because I can no longer afford to live on the meager salary they pay, even with publicly subsidized healthcare, multiple roommates, and second jobs. Second, I feel a growing sense of anger toward my institution that is unproductive, unsettling, and in need of translating. Third, and finally, I feel deeply saddened. The very institution that taught me to think and write about the intricacies of the human condition does not care if I can afford basic housing, healthcare, or financial stability while I teach their students. The institution that taught me how to see humanity with depth has chosen to see me as a number to be flattened on a page. I love teaching truth where I myself learned to access it, but my university does not care about that. My university does not pay me or dozens of other part time lecturers and adjuncts enough to be fully alive in their classrooms. They know they do not pay enough for many of their teachers to live, that many of their faculty work other jobs to survive. They know it and are okay with it. I can be okay with it, too, but I need them to admit it. I need them say it out loud: *we do not believe living wages are essential for the optimum performance of teachers for our students*. Or, *we are okay with our students paying full-price for courses taught by faculty who cannot afford to pay their full attention to those students.*\n\nThe fact that the university entrusts me to teach the analytical skills it takes to see and communicate their low standards is the most difficult truth for me to live with.I cannot ignore this topsy-turvy world they have empowered faculty to both teach and struggle within. I am one of many thousands of vastly underpaid lecturers and adjuncts teaching hundreds of thousands of American college kids. We are the backbone of every university. They cannot serve what they purport to offer without us. It nears amusement to consider how oblivious American universities have become to the growing resentment resulting from their mistreatment of the most diverse and trained generation of thinkers in American history. Do they think we are stupid? They taught us. Sometimes it feels like satire. They want teachers smart enough to teach critical thinking, but too stupid to realize they are being taken advantage of. It is as if they want architectural historians who see no physical and symbolic differences between the Pyramids of Egypt and the facades of Las Vegas or literature scholars who can only pull a fishing trip out of *Moby Dick.* You can blame Millenials for irony in pop culture but blame the prior generations in charge of the academy for forcing irony into education. Ironically, they helped Millenials understand that.\n\nI write this amidst the pandemic. COVID is freezing budgets in seemingly every industry. But even with some belt tightening, my university's endowment recently hit 2.3 billion and freshmen deposits for September enrollment surpassed administration's goals. A little over fifty percent of the university's revenue\u2014some $157 million in 2019\u2014comes from student tuition while the rest is made from sponsored programs, donations, and research grants. In the last year's financial report, the university's treasurer happily reported the institution \"experienced another successful year of strong financial growth and continued support of our primary mission of teaching and research, ending the year with assets totaling more than $7 billion.\"1 Things look financially rosy. But somehow, at the same time, I have woken up to the news that the university will not provide PPE to faculty. I read emails on my department's list-serve soliciting donations for a faculty-funded stock of masks, face shields, gloves and sanitizer. I am one of dozens of part time lecturers in just one single university department who walk into billion-dollar-backed- classrooms without affordable healthcare or provided PPE. Can anyone supply a good argument beyond cost saving as to why this is?\n\nWhile the endowment grows, so too do the numbers of students, parents, faculty, and staff who can no longer trust their university to do the right thing with that money. My university is but one of many and will defend themselves by comparing their awful numbers to the similarly awful numbers of other private institutions like them. They will probably counter my arguments by showing how other universities also pay similarly low wages. But that does little to allay my criticisms of how educational institutions have decided to handle themselves, not as leaders of purveying intellectual truths, but loyal followers of steady business. We expect it from Walmart, but not a school. My university can continue its path but I feel called to ask them to be honest about their choices. In a time of chaos and pain, I am selfishly asking for attention. I am asking students, faculty, administrators, parents, and all degree holders to consider my story and ask *is this what we want for each other?*\n\n**The Facts**\n\nI teach in the College of Arts and Sciences Writing Program at Boston University. Beginning as a graduate student and in the years following, I have designed and taught sixteen total undergraduate class sections over the course of eleven semesters, seven as a Graduate Writing Fellow (GWF) and nine as a Part-Time Lecturer (PTL). According to my union-won contract, I am scheduled for a modest raise of my per-class rate after teaching eight classes as a part-time lecturer. However, BU Labor Relations has denied me this raise by arguing that four of the nine classes do not count because I was still in my last year of school while teaching them and technically still a student. Despite paying me the lower PTL rate per class and allowing me to teach two sections a semester (which is not allowed for GWFs), they have reasoned that I was a productive and responsible enough educator for the workload but not the basic financial security. My contract allows me to purchase a health plan through BU, but it costs more than twenty-five percent of my annual salary\u2014three times as much as my current public subsidized plan. Public health is my best option.\n\nThe numbers are funny in a sad way. Fresh out of school PTLs like myself make roughly $6,000 per class at BU. If you're lucky and get offered to teach the maximum four total classes, you will make a little over $25,000 a year. The reality is more likely less as PTLs typically teach only two or three sections a year. The raise provides a little over $2,000 extra per class. Raise or not, PTLs still make below $30,000 a year without benefits for Ph.D. level work in one of the most expensive cities in the country and only after teaching for two years at an even lower rate. Each course, capped at around eighteen students and costing them each at least $5,000, generates close to $100,000 for BU. PTLs can make the university upwards of $400,000 in a year and receive less than ten percent of that. The funny: I am a highly educated and impressively employed thirty-one year old professor whose physical life resembles his students'. The sad: the raise would do little to change that.2\n\nI am single, white, straight, and male with a Ph.D. in New England. I have near fantastical odds of financially surviving. This sort of pain is a more easily weathered storm for a guy like me. I know that because I am an historian and my field of study clearly shows us how this world is set up for me to thrive. I have this wonderful luxury of being able publicly detest money for philosophical reasons and live more or less accordingly without mortal fear. Writing this essay critical of my employer, for example, is an immense privilege. So when I really pick apart my pain, the deepest source comes from the violation of intellectual truth imbedded in this struggle. It is the principle of the thing.\n\nI got the news they were denying my raise a month before the start of the fall 2020 semester. It was a Saturday. The week before was filled with faculty meetings on Zoom and I answered texts from colleagues. *Did your raise go through? I still haven't found out myself*. I opened up my personal email account to follow conversations with my union reps and comrades discussing all the ways BU was refusing to help teachers prepare for mandatory in-person teaching amidst the pandemic. It was not all bad. I wrote a letter of recommendation for a student applying to a study abroad program\u2014a joyous task as it was in support of a motivated freshman who refused to let COVID interrupt his spring semester and completed my course with style and grace. (For the sake of transparency, I feel I must disclose that those summer meetings and student advising sessions were paid for by the State of Massachusetts Unemployment Office.)\n\nSummertime can open up all sorts of beautiful moments for teachers. The most passionate learners come out of the woodwork. At the request of another student, I took and emailed iPhone photos of an out-of-print essay I had by Howard Zinn, BU's own radical professorial patron saint of yore, so that they could expand their already graded research paper. Their essay deals with Depression Era Boston and the beginnings of a politically and socially radical yacht club for working-class youth and they needed some background history. Zinn's essay is a historiographical introduction to a collection of speeches and essays by New Deal politicians and progressive journalists. In a Zoom meeting, my student and I discussed a striking quote, \"Their thinking does not give us facile solutions, but if history has uses beyond that of reminiscence, one of them is to nourish lean ideological times with the nectar of other years.\"3 What a wonderful summer reminder. It might be a lean time, but that does not preclude it from nourishment. Nice work if you can afford it. If I got fired today, I would be content with having introduced just one BU student to Howard Zinn. He, along with Martin Luther King Jr. and now Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, are among the institution's best.\n\nMy writing courses tend to focus on the history of play and public space in America, mostly in the late nineteenth century. We examine bicycles, boats, baseball, and boxing alongside urban public parks, racetracks, stadiums, YMCAs, and underground fight clubs. I put the word \"sport\" in my course titles whenever possible. Surprisingly, I have never had more than half of a section comprised of athletes. Similarly, my courses have also been divided somewhat equally along gender identities. My students initially often think they have signed up for a writing course about sports history, which makes sense as I use overtly flashy titles like \"American Sweat: Origins of Modern Sport and Recreation.\" However, they end up diving deep, sometimes uncomfortably so, into how sports culture does not exist in a vacuum. In fact, a major take away from units on Boston bicycling in 1890s is how male politicians and cultural leaders of all kinds publicly argued that women should not be allowed to sweat in public space. Studying early twentieth century boxing, students dwell on the full-bodied paintings of George Bellows and grainy silent films of semi-legal pugilism to get a grasp on the history of toxic, violence-dependent masculinity.4 At the end of every semester I make the same joke: I tricked you all. When I look at my pay stubs, though, it seems like I have been tricked, too.\n\n**The Symbols**\n\nThe recent denial of my raise is little more than the small financial tip on top of a larger conceptual iceberg that has been floating in my professional life for a while. The fall of 2019 was my first semester teaching with a Ph.D. I taught two sections at the entry rate. $12,000 was not enough to pay my normal bills and the newest additions of publicly subsidized medical insurance and student loans, both of which had been previously covered and deferred by my graduate student status. I got a part-time job as a bicycle courier in Boston, a stimulating gig for a historian of play and cities. Tuesdays and Thursdays I spent my days on campus teaching and holding office hours. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays I was downtown on my bike with a sling bag full of legal fillings and architectural plans, rushing to move them to and from court houses and office buildings for stamps and signatures. There is not a lot of money in the bicycle courier world, but it was enough for me to make ends meet. I was happy to alternate between leg work and mind work as the leaves of Boston changed. I graded papers in high-rise lobbies while on standby, delighted to watch the city breathe in front me.\n\nHalfway through the semester, I started to worry about more than BU's payroll strategies. In November, the right-wing podcaster Ben Shapiro came to campus to give a talk titled, \"America Was Not Built on Slavery, It Was Built On Freedom.\" The BU chapter of the Young Americans for Freedom, a national conservative student group, sponsored the talk and successfully gave away 1,500 tickets to mostly white college aged young men. In the weeks preceding, I started opening my classes with brief warm-up discussions about Shapiro. Should he be allowed to speak at BU? I looked for guidance from my administration, but found little more than vague quotes from the deans about free speech and safety in the university's daily press release, *BU Today*.5 We tackled the issue anyways. Many of my students were motivated to understand how someone who champions the phrase \"facts don't care about your feelings,\" could be so controversial. After all, we were in a nonfiction writing class learning how to research facts.\n\nAt the beginning of each day, we examined different examples of Shapiro's writing\u2014 tweets, book chapters, articles from his website\u2014and placed them against whatever writing lesson was on the docket for the day. Without fail, his work broke nearly every rule of valid argumentation outlined in our textbook. During a unit on balancing sources, we read a short article from November 2019 he wrote amidst the heated Democratic Primary.6 Shapiro rails against the Democrats for being \"too ashamed to stand with an actual pro-Israeli group.\" Nearly every sentence reads in this exclamatory language that my students quickly recognized as argumentative, and thus requiring evidence. If you argue the existence of a fact (Democrats feel ashamed), our textbook suggests showing how and why you believe that in order to build trust with the reader and thus convince them (evidence of a Democrat expressing shame). The article continues without a single quote, mention of an explicit source, or any voice other than Shapiro's. Under the freshman magnifying glass, we discovered that very little of his writing passes the basic standards of our BU-recommended writing textbook. We concluded that Shapiro was easily the most untrustworthy writer we had encountered all semester. He is a *New York Times* best selling author and host of a wildly popular podcast, but we could not find any of his work that would receive a passing grade in our class. My students, wonderfully growing as researchers and thinkers, kept asking, \"Why is BU supporting this?\" Free speech is important on campus and student groups can and should sponsor speakers at their schools, but BU did little to contextualize Shapiro and left anyone who did not know of him already relatively aimless in determining what he really means on their campus.\n\nI attended the evening talk in order to investigate on behalf of my class. Shapiro's lecture only led to more questions. There were so few facts to be found. The title alone had sparked righteous outrage on campus and when huge full-color posters with his face draped exterior dormitory walls, many students made their feelings known through protest and anticipated Hitler mustache graffiti. It was hard *not* to see his planned visit as a stunt to rile up emotion. Before the talk, I waited in a closely packed pre-COVID line, holding a notebook, some printed out articles and tweets, and my textbook. There was a group of four male BU student Shapiro fans in front me. It was cold and they all wore those thousand dollar coats with dead Canadian coyotes on the hood. They asked what all my stuff was for. When they learned I intended to ask a Shapiro what he thought of my students' critique of his writing methodology, they told me I was going to get \"owned.\" I was able to hold the ear of one of them. He told me he had earned an A in his required writing course. I explained how his fellow students found that much the work from the man we were about to see would not earn the same grade. \"Hm,\" he said.\n\nThe actual talk lasted forty-odd minutes and concluded with a brief question and answer section. I sat near a microphone with the intention of getting first in line but perhaps for the best, eager students beat me to it. I did not get to ask him to respond to our class findings that his writing possesses little reliable fact and startling amounts of plainly alarmist language. But I did not need to. He gave us the evidence anyways. Shapiro lectured at a lightening fast and near impossible to follow cadence, slowing down and stopping only when protestors stood up with signs. He recited Atlantic slave trade statistics from a few historians and a great deal of quotes from the slave holding Founding Fathers to support the tired and beaten argument that early America was merely a mild sinner in the context of many western colonial powers who owned even more slaves.7 However, like a lot of struggling students, he clearly stopped researching after page one and forgot to mention that America alone developed chattel slavery. He omitted mentioning that America pioneered the system in which it was legally decided that human beings could be *born* slaves, a system that required violent enforcement easily traceable through documentation to today's police forces. This system of course allowed the Founding Fathers, who were mostly skilled white businessmen creating wealth from trading slave-made goods with other colonies, to eliminate the need to import slaves at the high numbers of other Western powers.8 I sat quietly and gave thanks to my history professors at BU for teaching me how to read and understand the truth. I will never go Vegas and believe to have seen the Pyramids.\n\nWhile he rattled off quotes and sprinkled in jabs at the left, much of the lecture time was given to a mic'd up Shapiro calmly talking over yelling protestors. A YouTube search reveals this to be a signature feature of his public appearances. On the *Daily Wire* channel, chopped up videos of him clashing with protestors have racked up millions of views. Most have aggressive all-caps verbs in the titles: \"DESTROYS,\" RIPS,\" CRUSHES.\"9 At BU, he opened his talk saying, \"The lecture that I'm giving is almost pointless, because if America was built on slavery, not freedom, then we wouldn't have a bunch of protestors outside exercising that freedom\u2014and good for them.\" Later, he offered \"no thanks to the leftists who sought to have this lecture cancelled out of apparent fear of my wretched evil... who wrote that BU should ban me to protect its students from me. Look at me. Saying things.\"10 None of the half dozen questions asked by students after the talk related to the content of the lecture. Most were requests for Shapiro to comment on Twitter feuds he was in with politicians and celebrities. We watched a grown man brag about his life's work winning emotionally charged battles of his own creation. Cellphones and video cameras were everywhere. We had all collectively participated in a wrestling match to be broadcasted on the Internet later. His fans were there to watch their man play- out the verbs they read in his video titles, hopeful of becoming an extra in a whole new recorded scene filled with USA chants and police escorting protestors out of the venue. Fittingly, the talk was held not in a lecture hall, but the track and field building, a place where students' hard physical work leads towards clear winning or losing. In the night's match for truth, BU lost.\n\nI returned to my class to discuss the lecture. The disappointment of not getting to ask a question was real. We had all this evidence from Shapiro's writing and passages from our textbook, but ultimately our work was unfinished. Thankfully, academic work is always unfinished. Good arguments built on solid research should always lead to more questions. We discover truth not to win anything for ourselves, but to simply understand it better so we can all have more of it. But we still could not understand why BU supported the talk. My lecture observations were another source and *BU Today* put the above Shapiro quotes on the official record for us all. We wondered, can he explain why believing slavery contributed to America precludes you from also celebrating your right to free speech? It would have been great to get Shapiro on the record directly responding to my class. We still want comment. Mr. Shapiro, if you are reading this, please respond to our argument: \"Your work is controversial on college campuses not simply because of the content, but also because your methodology rarely meets basic standards of college-level research, writing, and thinking\\*.\\*\"\n\nThree students reached out to me individually with the desire to discuss more about truth, free speech, and the role of the university during office hours. My bike messenger schedule made it near impossible to meet with more than one student at a time in my shared office with six PTLs, two desks, two computers with Windows 7, and no actual windows. Still, our conversations were productive and enlightening. Teachers dream of moments like those, where students excitedly build a bridge between the classroom and the real world. We had energy, we had momentum, we had ideas for an op-ed or letter to the editor. But I got tired and slow, increasingly soggy and cold from delivering packages on my bicycling between days of teaching through a rainy late November. I let a really powerful potential student project slip away. Sometimes on a slow job from downtown to the Back Bay I would incorporate the Charles River Esplanade into my run. Long straight paths protected from cars can let a cyclist's mind wander. I would think about all the excited student questions that I would never have enough time to answer, the conversations left in their cocoons. I hope those students remember and I hope they know I am sorry for letting them down.\n\nIt eventually came out that after some debate, BU folded to pressure and agreed to pay the roughly $13,000 in security costs for the hour-long lecture.11 In other words, BU paid the same amount of money for one night of blatantly elementary history lecturing as they do to members of their faculty for teaching two semester-long courses. Resentment grew. It was especially hard because the better I did my job the easier it was to feel indignant. Experiences that helped me feel like a meaningful teacher revealed deeply uncomfortable truths. When I did the work of my mentors, I saw pain not just in the past, but also in my life. When discomfort turned to depression, I was happy to be on my bicycle three days a week, downtown and far away from campus.\n\n**Facts and Symbols: Boston University, 1970 and 2020**\n\nThe students kept me going. No matter how much I loved the respite of riding downtown, I always felt like I was failing my students. I would ride and think and think and ride and their work always filled my head, reminding me I was still a teacher. A month before the spring 2020 semester, my program director offered me a third class, which would be enough compensation to leave the courier work behind and teach full time. In fact, teaching five sections in a year\u2014two in the fall, three in the spring\u2014technically counts as a full-time load. I immediately jumped at the opportunity to be a full-time academic. Even as COVID blew my course plans apart mid-semester, my students and I still crafted some valuable time together. I made the PTL rate of $18,000 dollars for those three classes and I felt rich. I saved a little and even bought myself a hand-built boutique road bike from 1991. This summer, in between preparing for my two classes this fall and sifting through emails, I have been riding it far out of the city without a bag on my back, delivering nothing but fresh landscapes into my mind. The student who asked for a recommendation for a study aboard program ended their email with a similar sentiment. The cycling history we studied in class inspired them to follow their uncle into the sport when the pandemic forced them to move home. Biking far and fast, they told me, was a nourishing break from studying organic chemistry over Zoom all summer.\n\nLike Howard Zinn suggests, I look to history and the work of others to maintain my mind and water ideological droughts. Diving into the history of BU has helped me understand and contextualize my experiences. Years ago as a graduate student, I completed a project for a class on construction of BU's mid-1960s concrete buildings designed by Spanish architect Josep Llui\u0301s Sert. My favorite sources were the photographs of the buildings from the student-run yearbooks, *The Hub.* I found powerful images of blocks' worth of brownstones being demolished with the Prudential tower under construction and cleverly framed into the background. When I found the shelf of the yearbooks in the library, I did as all historians do and sat on the floor of the stacks to read before I decided what I wanted to check out. When I looked at the 1970 yearbook, I chuckled with plain joy. There were beautifully photographed full-page spreads of poorly rolled joints and \"END THE DRAFT\" buttons. The kids are always all right. But the section for portraits of university administration stood out the most. In simple two-tone black and white, four silhouetted figures stand with their arms stretched out in the seig heil position.12 Revisiting these sources, it is clear how those students saw their university leaders. Historians wonder, what has changed over time?\n\nZinn was in the middle of his educational career when BU students went on strike in response to the Vietnam War and closed the university in May of 1970. A radical spirit filled the campus. The yearbook included a timeline. \"*Thursday April 30th:* U.S. Forces start Cambodian operation.\" \"*Sunday, May 10:* Rock concert held at Nickerson Field. Collection taken for Black Panther Defense Fund. Press praises BU for handling of tense situation.\"13 The demonstrations culminated when students succeeded in forcing BU to fund a summer program of courses on community engagement they designed and cleverly titled, \"Communiversity.\" The goal was to \"deal directly with such critical problems as war, inflation, the deterioration of cities and civilian services, and the pollution of the environment.\"14 In so many ways, the challenge and work students face with their universities remains the same.\n\nLike 2020, there was no in-person commencement ceremony for BU students in 1970. Instead of a pandemic, however, the students themselves had shut it down. Ironically, it rained that day, meaning there ceremony would have been cancelled regardless of the collective action. In a short essay printed towards the end of the yearbook, a student flexed their analytical skills and described a silver lining in the storm clouds. They wrote, \"The irony lies not in the lack of a cap and gown, or in the optimistic rhetoric of some, nor even in this climax or anti-climax of maturity. It lies in the fact that we, the Class of 1970, ended our stay profoundly.\" It is a bright student who can understand what the university is really for, reason and action not regalia and rhetoric. They concluded, \"We either learned something new, or began to apply our 'knowledge.' Maybe we had a Commencement after all.\"15\n\nI wonder if Zinn loved teaching at BU and how he felt during that heady year on campus. I assume it was invigorating. His classes were regularly overenrolled and it is clear he motivated students to not just think like an intellectual, but act like one too. I imagine he flipped through that yearbook with delight. I have also loved teaching at BU. The Writing Program has been an intellectual home most young academics like me can only dream of. But the administration above my department makes it feel like just that, a dream of some distant place in my mind far away from reality. Boston University is on a dangerous path towards becoming an institutional facsimile our president: just another business stripping people of resources to make themselves feel whole. Is that the role of higher education?\n\nI am here to report that approach does not work for creating substance, truth, or happiness. It merely creates a fac\u0327ade, a shell, a balloon. BU might be a balloon, but my colleagues and I are not. Neither are our students. And we are still free to think and write, even if that means wading through painful truths. History shows us that. I have decided to take an optimistic approach and believe that BU is still the institution for teachers, students, and alumni like Zinn, King, and AOC. Indeed, the history of the university and its students reveals a pattern of love and action that fills me with hope. If the balloon pops, or the fac\u0327ade falls over, I believe there will always be students and teachers there to build something real on campus.

My heart hurt reading through your writing, as your love for teaching and education is as apparent as the university\u2019s hypocrisy by not treating the very people that make up the institution well. \n\nYou sound like a wonderful teacher, and the lines about building a bridge between classroom and the world as well as the cocoons of questions, were touching. Although I am a business student, my favorite classes at BU have been my WR120 and WR151 courses. The work professors like you do is imperative for students to learn critical thinking skills, a priority that seems to have gotten lost. \n\nWe wish you the best, and I hope the BU administration will do something about this grave mistreatment of their faculty.",

You were a great professor and you were even kind enough to write me a rec when I needed one. It's a shame to see you go, but you definitely deserve better. Good luck in the future, and I hope that BU actually reads and listens to what you send them.

            "comment": "Many thanks to all for your thoughtful questions and reactions of solidarity. I'm going to answer many of the questions posed below in a single response here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Yes, I have considered and actually followed through on submitting the essay. Who knows if it will ever get properly published. At this point, it seems better to just get it read by interested people--students, factually, admin, etc. This is why I have opted to post in fully here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Many thanks so all my former students! I've had a blast teaching about skateboarding and sports. It's a joy to write letters of rec!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-I have heard that the Writing Program classes are students' favorites many times. My best guess as to why: Truly, the writing faculty at BU are a diverse bunch of creatives and intellectuals--not just more traditional scholars (historians, literary, sociology, etc), but also artists (poets, novelists, musicians, painters, business owners, and so on). And because we teach methods--how to write, make arguments, conduct research--faculty get to lean on our passions for designing the content of our courses. It results in engaging courses taught by people who not only love what they teach, but also know how to teach TWO topics at once: writing methods AND whatever content you end up writing about--poetry, novels, live jazz, modern architecture. I really feel like writing faculty generally love to teach.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Indeed, the closing of libraries for extended reading and browsing has been a real COVID loss. I miss just walking the stacks without a mask on, smelling all that aging dust and paper and cardboard. It's a great reminder to find a bookstore and spend a little cash on a special book for yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-On the minutiae of adjunct/lecturers/professors: It's terribly confusing and I barely understand it (let alone why it is this way). Here's what i got: Yes, there's a wide-ranging list of labels for the people who teach in a university. Adjuncts are treated the worst by far in terms of not only pay, but accommodation--rarely do you even get a desk at your school. Adjuncts also rarely receive any guarantees of work beyond a single semester or any buy-in options for benefits. Many adjuncts teach at multiple schools, which means they juggle multiple \"\\_\\_\\_[.edu](https://XXX.edu)\" email addresses in addition to their personal emails (students, please say hello and sign your name in ever email :) ). Next up is lecturers, who typically make a bit more per-class, can sometimes make it work at a single school, and, depending on the institution, might have options for some health benefits and retirement. Lecturers are often divided into silly tiers--part-time, full-time, senior, master, etc. Then it's professors--who's titles often include \"assistant\" or \"associate\" that typically designates seniority (and tenure, but that's a whole other story). Professors work in the bigger traditional departments like biology, history, engineering, etc. These teaching positions are paid a more middle-class salary with benefits and significant opportunities for travel and theoretically some financial and scheduled freedom to pursue academic and intellectual projects of their choosing. And yes, STEM departments often have more money to pay faculty that humanities departments so the pay rate is all over the place. As a commenter noted below, universities all over have participated in a trend of relying more and more on adjuncts and lecturers rather than full professors. It's one of the many ways university's like BU have billion dollar endowments. [https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/higher-education-college-adjunct-professor-salary/404461/](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/higher-education-college-adjunct-professor-salary/404461/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Ben Shapiro was too juicy a fruit not to pick. In the whole of the essay, my goal was to use that experience as a way to illustrate BU's severe loss of its sense of purpose, how it had developed extremely low standards for itself. It's clear I don't think Ben Shapiro is intelligent and actually quite hurtful. Last year he came to BU to argue that slavery had nothing to do with this country's founding. A year later Confederate flags are in the Capitol. I whole heartedly support BU allowing a student-run group to sponsor speakers like Shapiro--the student group footed big bills, too. But I absolutely do not support BU's total lack of contextualization of Shapiro. No single historian at BU would ever teach the history and arguments Shapiro makes because they've been proven to be dogshit. As I write in the essay, my students and I could not find any pieces of his writing that would pass a BU required freshman nonfiction writing class. My point: BU is an EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION and completely failed to highlight how Shapiro is a sensationalist commentator and not an actual journalist or historian or any kind of thinker that could pass a BU entrance exam. I hope the symbolism isn't lost: the university ended up shelling out more money to Shapiro for a single night of horribly false history that many of it's own historians. I merely ask for BU faculty to be treated the same as Shapiro.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-If you're feeling stressed, change into a nice pair of clean socks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll try to answer any more questions as they arise. I'm new to Reddit posting so I don't know the best way to go about this, but I'm trying. I could barely navigate Blackboard, but we'll see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSam",

I really hope that the administration reads this and takes it to heart, but if not then then at least the student body...\n\nI've never really had you for a class, but I feel like caring professors are who we need to have in our lecture halls. As soon those kinds of people are inevitably pushed out of this career, then it's only a matter of time before our universities decline. Maybe they've been declining already. Maybe they were never that good to begin with. Of course I'm not going to drop out, and nobody should. I just want things to change so that people who care about students can actually afford to care. Otherwise, well... where's my 70k going? (Sorry to put a more pragmatic lens there at the end, I just... yeah.)\n\nIt's really already pitiful enough that professors have not been given the bare minimum to stay safe and keep others safe, and now with these numbers in perspective... phew.

Since then, I've been working a borderline-dead-end job as a shift supervisor for a national chain of convenience stores. Not one of the better chains either, we're understaffed and underpaid, and it's only gotten worse in my time with the company. I can barely make ends meet, and I've almost given up on being able to go back to school and finish my degree someday.\n\nIn light of that, it fucking sickens me that I make more than *literally any professor.* Not a single one of y'all should be worse off than me. You put in the time, you earned your degree(s), you got a job that requires extensive qualifications - you should be compensated accordingly.\n\nEqually concerning is the fact that *a major university* is essentially propping up the same fa\u00e7ade as my shitty convenience store. We're all about \"helping our customers on the path to better health,\" just like a university is ostensibly there to help folks on their path to higher education... And yet, in both cases, that goal is being achieved by heaping yet more responsibility on employees without ever willingly increasing their compensation.\n\nI would ask if y'all had considered a strike, but I suspect that the administration would just fill an auditorium with the money they were supposed to pay you and swim around in it like Scrooge McDuck until they can find some scabs.",

In providing that extra funding, BU is tacitly endorsing Shapiro and his views, and people are well within their rights to call them out on that.",

If it becomes widely known on campus that admin isn't willing to pay security costs for speakers or at least certain speakers (or at least certain speakers), anyone who is willing use violence (or the threat of violence) to shut down expression they don't like can get what they want. If it were the case that there was a sizable right-wing mob at BU, I'd expect administration to spend the money to protect speakers that the mob might threaten.",

They don't get it and never will.\n\n\nFact is most college customers (students - self included) don't know better and are treated poorly as they are fed a promise that doesn't have to be followed through on.  Its all marketing to suck people in and then good riddance after 4 years, followed by hitting you up for donations.",

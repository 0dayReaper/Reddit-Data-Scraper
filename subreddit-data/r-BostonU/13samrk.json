    "postText": "Hey  guys, have admits for these universities for an MS in CS. Looking to  work after the masters, not interested in research. I'm an international  student if that matters.\n\n1. University of Central Florida - $82k for two years, dad would fund the program\n2. Boston University (BU MET college, not the GRS) - $80-85k PER year, 20 month program, would have to take an $80k loan or so\n\nIs Boston University (again, BU MET college) worth the $80k debt? Is it that much better than UCF?\n\nAny insights would be appreciated.\n\nPS: Other admits are EE at SUNY Buffalo, Data Science at UT Arlington and CS at George Mason",

            "comment": "hey, while CS salaries are good, for your first couple years even with a masters you potentially won't be making stacks to a point where you, like, won't have to worry about loan payments. Eventually it might pay off but with the cost of living right now and next couple years, I just wouldn't bank on it. \n\nif you're looking for advice about programs, I think EE is safe but only bc it's so fucking hard. basically  if you can do EE, than you can definitely code. and as for CS vs DS, I am of the opinion that you need to be good at math for both, but the concepts of pure CS will leak into DS, and if you need to learn DS math, that should be fairly doable. I think in general, CS can do DS. But not always can DS do CS",

A part time semester means that we are only doing 2 subjects in it, anything more than that is full time. \nNow cost for a full time semester is 31k dollars no matter if you take 3 subs or 4.\nSo let\u2019s say you do 2 full time semesters you\u2019d be paying around 62k dollars and be left with 2 subjects. \nSince now you\u2019re in your final semester you\u2019d only be playin the fee for individual credits and not the full time fee of 31k so for 2 subjects you\u2019d be paying 8k dollars \nSo in total you\u2019d be paying around 70k in tuition\nAdded insurance and stuff it\u2019s go for 77k",

Also, would completing the two year program in three semesters affect your chances of securing a full time role? As in you'd have lesser opportunities and time to get a full time role",

            "comment": "I did psych undergrad and going in I knew I'd need grad school to do what I wanted. It does catch some people off guard to discover that basically any therapy or counseling jobs require at least a masters.\n\nI have a number of psych major friends who decided they did not want to do grad school. They moved into other career paths. A number went into HR or accounting (usually programs for recent graduates that did not require degree speciality).\n\nThe most important thing is to remember your transferable skills. No, we can't pretend like we're therapists, as we don't have the training. We can emphasize the critical thinking we learned for reading and evaluating journal articles. We can discuss the communication skills we developed to present our work, both in writing and physical presenting. We also know some statistics (depending on how comfortable one might be).",

For psych majors you can go into non-degree specific jobs as a previous poster mentioned. If you did any sort of lab work or research you can apply to be a lab tech and work up to a lab manager position. Consulting in the Boston area is pretty big. Specifically medical device consulting. I have a good amount of friends across multiple majors in that field and they make good money with solid benefits. \n\nThere are things you can do, but youll be competing with people from more technical fields. If you\u2019re personable and a strong interviewer you can definitely find something you\u2019d like to do",

The best work experience in my opinion because I got direct clinical experience with patients, learned to apply everything I learned in undergrad, and got mentorship from people in all different fields to help me pick what direction I wanted to go (nursing, social work, psychiatry, management). Will be going to social work school in the fall for my MSW! I was lucky to find my job well before I graduated but I definitely felt a little lost as I approached my senior year, feel free to DM me with any q\u2019s and I\u2019d be happy to connect you with job leads too!",

Another good option if you are looking for a job directly related to psychology that only requires a BA is to check job postings at community health organizations. Many of them hire many Master\u2019s level therapists, but also hire psych graduates to do things like assisting with childcare or therapy groups for children with mental health conditions, working at residential programs, advocating for or working with families in crisis, etc. One of the organizations that was recruiting at BU is Sevita but there are many others.",

A lot of students either work while studying + loans or have financial aid, and loans start accruing interest the year your graduate, so people are incentivized to start working immediately. No rest for the weary in America.\n\nNo duh \ud83d\ude44 students can't afford to take time off school. They have loans or bills to pay like everyone else.",

I did not know what I wanted to do, where, or when.\n\nAfter graduation I got a job at a community mental health center as a case manager. I mainly did it because honestly it was the only option that only required a bachelor\u2019s and was entry level. It was a wholesome experience and it kinda gave me insight into social work. I still learned i didnt want to do this as a career tho\n\nI then got a job as a \u2018psych tech\u2019 (there are several names for these kind of jobs) at a mental health residential facility. I LOVED this job. It also only required a bachelor\u2019s and was entry level. Pay was better at a residential level than at a psych hospital. This is where I learned I did not want to be a therapist, I just liked helping people do every day things. \n\nAfter that, I tried this field called UX design. If you wanted to switch into a whole different world and like graphic design, this could be for you. having a psych background helps too. It wasn\u2019t for me, I missed my old job. \n\nNow, I am a manager of the psych techs at another residential facility. I just started so idk what it will be like BUT I think I am a little closer as to figuring out what I want to do next. I might get a masters in health management if I like being a manager. \n\nBut, I also was thinking of getting a phd in neuropsychology. It\u2019s just a huge decision. My psych major friends have also gone back to grad school and studied UX design and marketing. \n\nI am still trying not to feel like I wasted time and money but it is hard. Still, I also feel glad I learned so much about people\u2019s behavior lol it can be helpful outside a job as well. No ragrets.",

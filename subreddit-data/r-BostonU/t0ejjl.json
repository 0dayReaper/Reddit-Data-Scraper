Why do you need to tell us that campus will be open tomorrow, especially this early in the day?\n\nEdit: this is all rumors, but apparently it\u2019s closed because the Dean of Questrom asked BU admin to keep classes in person because of CORE presentations?? If that\u2019s the case, then I hope every BU admin who decided to needlessly risk people\u2019s lives today has trouble sleeping at night.",

    "postText": "My question is for folks in BU MET who require CPT approval to do an internship during summer. \nSo I just finished my CPT process and as part of it I had to register for a course something called \"CS506 Internship\" \n\nI just got billed $1.6k for a 2 credit course which is required for me to take as part of my CPT where all I need to do is report to my supervisor on what I\u2019m doing in my internship. \n\nThis seems a little unfair.",

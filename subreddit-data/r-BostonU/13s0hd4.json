Personally I can finish his 40 mcq exam in like 15 mins, it\u2019s not hard.\n\nMullen isn\u2019t a good prof, that\u2019s somewhat true. He can teach for sure, but like when I took it, he doesn\u2019t use full class time, and maybe repeat content in the next lecture (this one I don\u2019t remember for sure cuz I don\u2019t usually go to class), and the result of that is he had to push back both of midterm exams and cut down content at the end of semester to finish (but you can prob ask him for recording of those from 2020)",

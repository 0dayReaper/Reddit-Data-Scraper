            "comment": "Hi!\n\nSo everyone has a registration time which is when the registration system opens up for them. In order to register, you must be compliant, which can be found on student link under \"Personal.\" Some departments require advising codes, which you get by talking to your advisor either on Zoom or by email. Your advisor will email you about this.\n\nBefore actually registering, you can use the registration planner to figure out your schedule. Look into your department's websites and/or talk to your advisor to see the required courses for the major you are pursuing to figure out which classes you need to take.\n\nIn student link, click \"My [Academics](https://student.bu.edu/MyBU/s/academics)\", then registration planner. Under Fall 2023, you will see \"Reg Options,\" and once you click that you can plan out your classes and eventually register once the time listed there passes.\n\nYou can add as many classes as you want to your \"Planner\" to design the schedule that you want and change things around as must as you want. You can also use the [Course Catalog](https://www.bu.edu/phpbin/course-search/) to find classes you want to take.\n\nOnce it is time to register, the easiest way is it make sure all the classes you want are in the Planner. Then, click \"Register for Class\" which you won't see until your registration time arrives. You will see at the top \"Planner GO\". Click GO and \"Mark to Add\" all the classes you want from your planner, then click \"Add Classes to Schedule.\" You will get a green check mark next to the classes you are now officially registered for, and under Registration those classes will now be shown!\n\nYou can change your classes, switch sections, drop classes, etc until a few weeks into the school year, so even after you register there is room for change if you decide you want to take a different class.\n\nLmk if you have any other questions, hope this helps!!! :)",

For example, I\u2019m trying to sign up for NE 101 in the planner (neuroscience required course) and there is a red flag symbol on the course, meaning that the course is full. How is this possible?? Registration isn\u2019t even opened yet.",

If there is a red flag due to a class being full, and you need that class for your major, I would recommend that you reach out to your advisor. Red flags could also be there to save spots for students in a particular major/specialization.",

I think you're supposed to pick BX if there are no open seats that fit into your schedule. Probably is a better idea to line up some preferences (B2 then C2 then D2 then E2 etc) rather than getting something random like a 9pm or 8am. Just checked and all of those are Thursday at 12:30 (different rooms) so there are at least 4 good options for you!! Hope this helps!",

    "postText": "**Please upvote/comment on this post so more can see it to raise awareness.** This is regarding a previous post I made about SHS and psychiatric hold.  I made another post here telling everyone: **please do SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP when you need it**, I do not intend on discouraging anyone from going to SHS for mental health support, and some redditors have reached out to me **saying that the actual cost might be a lot lower to none.** But please make sure you talk to SHS and the insurance department to understand the potential costs associated in case a psychiatric hold occurs beforehand so there will be no surprises.\n\nMy intention wasn't to harm any students but to make students aware that there might be high cost incurred from a psychiatric hospitalization, as when I saw the potential bill and the insurance told me I may have to spend a long time paying for it, it was a huge shock to me and significantly increased my suicidal ideation, so I wanted to avoid having the same thing happening to other students, but now I have deleted it given the other comments that other students made on my post. I will update the actual cost once I settled for it for informational purpose. I hope that it is going to be a lot lower than the estimate.\n\nI was in a severe panic and depressed state when I made the post so **I apologize for any damages done to anyone.** I felt regretful making the post and I deleted it already, and a redditor suggested this from BU's center for psychiatric rehabilitation that may be beneficial for other students. **If you need help, please get it and check this out:** [https://cpr.bu.edu/wellness-and-recovery-services/](https://cpr.bu.edu/wellness-and-recovery-services/).\n\nPlease don't make rude comments here. My intention now is just to reverse the damages done to anyone and I believe that no one should be in the same state that I am in right now. I truly hope ***you*** can get help. **If you are feeling suicidal/down/depressed like me please get the support you deserve.** I believe in all of you.",

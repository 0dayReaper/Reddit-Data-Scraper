            "comment": "i\u2019d say getting an ipad depends on how much ur willing to spend on tech and ur note taking habits and ur classes. if u have a lot of classes where u need to write work out, like math or physics or chem, i\u2019d recommend getting an ipad. it\u2019s also a lot easier than carrying 4-5 notebooks and folders. definitely buy the goodnotes limitless if u do get an ipad, it\u2019s a one time payment of like $10 and much less restrictive than the base app.\n\nif u prefer typing over writing tho, skip the ipad because it\u2019ll be a waste of money if ur not really using it.",

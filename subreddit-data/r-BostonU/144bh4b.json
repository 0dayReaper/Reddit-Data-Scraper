    "postText": "Hi! For Fall 2023, I'm an incoming transfer COM student, and don't really know what I want to do for housing, or if I even have an option. Are transfers placed with freshmen? Do you guys have any advice, or can tell me just how worth it is for a traditional-style dorm vs apartments or suites? I've been researching and making calls, but wanted to hear from other students. Thanks!",

            "comment": "I'm a transfer too. I would recommend you look for off-campus housing if you are looking for a private room. At this point, you most likely won't get a private room on campus. Try Reddit, fb, Zillow. But if you are fine living with others, consider apartment (that's the housing office's suggestions) first. But again, hard to get good apt type at this time.\n\nIf you wanna see what the on campus housing looks like, search BU housing website for more pics, floor plans of each dorm.",

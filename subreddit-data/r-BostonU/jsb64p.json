    "postText": "Sooo I posted about having a crush a few weeks ago so here\u2019s the update for anyone that may have been wondering: \nI decided to stop being a wimp and asked them out. Spent the day out yesterday and it was excellent. Felt like I found my twin (in terms of personality). Might actually have something kindling. Anyways thanks for the encouragement y\u2019all, was worth it 100% lol yay for luv",

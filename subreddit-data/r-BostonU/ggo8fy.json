However when my chem TFs tell me the exam was harder than their intro chem classes and they feel sorry for us, that\u2019s when I know it isn\u2019t about learning. If PhD students deem it difficult, then what\u2019s the point? What\u2019s the point of doing discussion packets and then getting blindsided by an exam unlike those exact packets you spend 6 hours on every week in office hours? If they wanted to weed people out, then intro bio, neuroscience, and physics classes should be the same difficulty. However, they\u2019re not and people genuinely do well in those classes because the effort to grade ratio is 1:1.",

However, I would like you to consider the fact that most of the discussion TFs and the Lab TFs for these classes essentially take this class with us. They have to do the entire packet of problems, be able to explain them, and properly teach them to us. That's why I am making that statement. If they get to see what's coming at every corner and still say that at times certain exams are too difficult (not saying all), then I would say there are some changes necessary. \n\nYou are 100% right in your example. If you put me in a class like molecular bio right now and gave me some random exam, I would be like \"Hold on, give me a minute to remember this random bit of information that I needed for this class.\"",

But that raises many questions for chem students, why did so many of them cheat? Then the burden falls on the profs. Why do many alumni even today remember how horrible chem was. There\u2019s a line between a difficult class, and an impossible one. I get the weeding out, but we don\u2019t want to kill 18-19 year olds. They suck and that\u2019s a fact.

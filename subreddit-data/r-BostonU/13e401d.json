    "postText": "I've been admitted to both BU and Tufts for a MSCS and I can't decide where to go. I know BU is ranked better than Tufts for CS, though I was concerned BU would be more difficult due to it being more difficult to get into and the courses all being 4-credits compared to 3-credits at Tufts. I'll be working full-time and taking classes part-time so I just don't want to jeopardize my studies by taking on too much. I've also heard BU does not have good CS professors, is this true? What is the workload like (particularly grad-level classes)? How hard is it to do well at BU and do you think you're getting a good CS education? I really want to get a strengthen my CS knowledge, make connections, and improve my job prospects. Thank you for your help!",

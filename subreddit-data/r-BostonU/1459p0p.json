I had extenuating circumstances such as both my parents going through major surgeries ,mental health issues, and not liking my major. I since then switched majors and have been doing well. Just wanted to know what people wrote in their appeal and tips for being successful. Thanks :)",

I also said that I was seeking out mental health resources and made a list of things I would do in the upcoming semester to stay on track.\n\nSome of the things I included were:\n- meet regularly with academic advisor to ensure I am staying on track or to talk to them if I am struggling \n- reach out to my professors if the course load is becoming overwhelming to find a solution together \n- will continue to meet with a therapist \n- will come up with an academic calendar schedule with my advisor to better manage my time\nAnd more\u2026\n\nThey just want to hear specifically what you were going through, acknowledge that you should\u2019ve reached out sooner/your attempts to get help, and your plan of action going forward. Hope this helps! Good luck \ud83c\udf40",

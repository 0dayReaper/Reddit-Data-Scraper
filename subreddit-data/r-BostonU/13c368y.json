I don\u2019t mind which area I am living in (warran also consider).\n\nAlso, if the on campus housing doesn\u2019t work out, any suggestions on finding an off campus housing?",

Pretty much all the singles were taken before junior selection this year though, so there probably won\u2019t be too much turnover. \n\nI\u2019m not experienced w off campus housing but my roomate tried to find some and got scammed by a couple different agents so be careful. Def not impossible, but might be a bit harder to find a reasonable price/ location this close to next term. Just make sure to do tons of research.",

It\u2019s like a form you fill out. I was a fall sem transfer so I don\u2019t know a ton about spring transfer stuff, but you\u2019ll likely only be able to participate if you get your housing assignment in the earlier part of the summer. If you get assigned later in the summer w the freshmen, you will not be able to participate. \n\nMy roomate is currently searching for housing with a pretty set group of their friends, sorry. But overall off-campus is your best bet for a single. Good luck w ur search!",

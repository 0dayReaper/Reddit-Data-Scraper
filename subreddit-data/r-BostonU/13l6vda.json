I am on academic probation and unfortunately did not meet the requirements to get off of it. I think i have shown some improvement andI was wondering does this spell doom for me? Am I fucked and bound for suspension? This semester did take a huge tool on my mental health (although not a justification it is the truth) and despite that i still tried my hardest and it has shown in some grades. I really cant afford to be suspended and idk",

Students can be on Academic Probation for no more than two consecutive semesters.\n\nI'd suggest contacting your advisor ASAP.",

Also have a plan on how you are going to achieve this. For instance attending more TA/Professors office hours, taking care of yourself etc. having improved your grades it\u2019s a good starting point for conversation with them.",

What happened is at the end of the semester, the ENG department pretty much dismissed me immediately and rejected appeal (citing the under 2.0 for 2 semesters rule). \n\n  \nBut I worked with the academic counselors and his advisor and managed to work out a deal where I could do 12 credits in the summer (either at BU or elsewhere) and get mental health treatment. I had to do really well in the classes and show reports on therapy and stuff.\n\n  \nThey wanted to suspend me for Fall and make me come back in Spring but I kept asking and I got back in for Fall, after that I was super careful which professors and classes I took (because alot of profs in ENG and Sciences like to fck students over on grades). I also used easy classes to boost my GPA back up at the beginning to avoid AP.",

May I know your GPA and what grade you were in when you were in the same situation as me? Because I'm major in computer science. Ur experience would be much helpful.TT",

    "postText": "Hi y'all! I know it's kind of late but I'm hoping to move off-campus for the Fall and am looking for 1-2 (F) roommates for a 2-3 bed, 1 bath apartment in either the Park Dr/Buswell/ Beacon St or Allston/West Campus-ish area.\n\nIdeal price range is anything &lt; $1600/month per person, and hoping to move in late August / beginning of September.\n\nI've had my eye on a few listings that match these preferences so far but I just need a roommate to seal the deal, so please PM if interested!",

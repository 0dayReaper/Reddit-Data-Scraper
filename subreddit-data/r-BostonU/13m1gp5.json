Some of them will give industry-specific advice, and some of them may even give you an email of a direct person you can send your resume and materials to.\n\nAlso if you\u2019re applying on indeed, try to find the company\u2019s website and see if there is a careers section where you can apply. I know applying on indeed is easy, but some recruiters take preference of candidates that didn\u2019t apply on indeed because they\u2019re more likely mass applying to places and are less interested in working at that particular company.\n\nAnd if you have friends in your field, ask them the same questions you\u2019d ask someone on linked in or social media.\n\nLastly, if you\u2019d like, I can give feedback on your resume. I\u2019m a grad student on med campus and I used to help undergrad students edit their resumes and papers when I was an office assistant, and now I just do it for funsies occasionally lol \n\nmessage me if you\u2019d like feedback, happy to help a fellow BU student",

Not all industries work this way but many times you\u2019re going to get jobs based on connections, either someone knowing a position is opening and can get your resume up to the top or meeting the people making hiring decisions. Don\u2019t waste your time on LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, etc. \n\nI\u2019m a 2020 COM grad and know the job hunt nightmare all too well, but all of my jobs have come from networking. Find a job title you want to have or a company you want to work at and ask people for quick informational interviews. They know you\u2019re looking for work without saying it outright. Especially alumni! BU loves to help BU, and if you keep up with those contacts every 8-10 weeks (trust me, you\u2019re not annoying, just share what\u2019s going on in your professional life/projects you\u2019re working on during the search) then you\u2019ll be top of mind when a position does open up. \n\nAlso happy to share more networking advice or messaging specifics! I\u2019ve been mentoring current students and recent grads for a while now and love love love helping people get jobs :)",

When I was initially trying to apply for jobs out of undergrad (in arts &amp; then in publishing) I had trouble partly because I didn\u2019t know anyone who could connect me to who/what I was trying to get to! networking feels like a total scam but in my anecdotal experience it\u2019s a huge help",

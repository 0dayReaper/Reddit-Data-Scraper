What should I do? If i drop it and add the correct one will it show as a W on my transcript ?? or should I talk with my academic advisor ??",

Dropping without a W is allowed even several weeks into the semester.\nAlso...FY101 isn't like an academic course, no one should care if you did somehow get a W.\n\nThe semester calendar will always have the official dates/deadlines including drop without and drop with a W.\nhttps://www.bu.edu/reg/calendars/semester/\nFor Fall 2023, last day to drop without W is 10/10/23.\n\nPeople change their schedules all the time over breaks/summer before the semester officially begins. \n\nYou shouldn't even have to drop the course I think because you just need to change sections. Under Reg Options, there should be \"change section\" so you don't have to actually drop the class to then register for the same one, different section.",

I figured it out on my own well ahead of Orientation (back when incoming first years and transfers couldn't register until you were in person at orientation) but that's just me trying to learn everything I could about this new environment I was entering.\n\nBut yeah there's...no guides or steps or tutorials on to use the registration system???",

But nope, that requires paying more staff \ud83e\udee0 why do that when we can make the existing small team do all the work? \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0",

The number of applicants is just SO HIGH. \n\nI just looked it up, back in 2012 when I started undergrad, there were 37k applicants my class year. This year had 80k!!! And I'm pretty sure the admissions team is the same size because BU rarely expands departments.",

    "postText": "I just got accepted to BU for this fall's M.A. in History program. I'm super stoked, but unfortunately, I'm having major trouble finding housing. \n\nI signed up for on-campus housing, but I'm currently on a waitlist, and I don't know if I'll get a spot on campus. :(\n\nIf I can't get on campus housing (I was told the last day for students to drop a housing spot is July 15), how do I go about getting off-campus housing? I'm from Florida, and super sheltered lol. I've only lived on on-campus dorms during my college years at my undergraduate institution, so I have no idea about living off campus. Honestly, it scares me a bit.\n\nI'll only have access to student loans, and I'm currently unemployed and living with my parents this summer. How do I find roommates? And what would be the next steps? Do I just pick any apartment near campus? Do I have to place a deposit ahead of time?\n\nGoing to BU is a dream come true for me. I really need some help, please. :(",

            "comment": "BU does have a resource for finding off campus apartments.\n\nhttps://offcampus.bu.edu/\n\nThey have a tool to find roommates too on that site.\n\nMost people just find a random roommate, usually through Facebook. Search for apartment listings via Zillow or other real estate sites, or through Facebook. There are many Boston, neighborhood, and BU housing Facebook groups where people post available apartments or room within a shared apartment or posts looking for a roommate.\n\nYou could also contact local real estate agencies for help finding an apartment, but then there\u2019s the realtor fee up to 1 month\u2019s rent (and they usually do charge the full amount). That route might be harder if your only income is student loans. They may ask for a co-signer and proof of their income. Usually parents but anyone can be a co-signer.\n\nThere are also some subreddits like r/bostonhousing \n\nWarning: If something sounds too good to be true it probably is. Renting \u201csite unseen\u201d can be especially dangerous for scams but if you can\u2019t afford to fly up here and stay on boston while looking for apartments, many out of state people have to go with \u201csite unseen\u201d. Request a live video walk through if possible to ensure the place matches photos from the listing.",

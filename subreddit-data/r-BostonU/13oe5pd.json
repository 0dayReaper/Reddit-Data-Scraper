Seeing SCJ Jackson receive her award in person was a definite highlight (and helped explain all the snipers on the rooftops\u2026)\n\nDavid\u2019s speech had the usual \u201cnuggets\u201d of decent advice, but some parts were absolutely terrible and he drug it on too long at the end / repeating himself (intentional or not).\n\nThings that stood out:\n\n* using Jack Welch as an inspiration\u2026 the guy that ran GE into the ground and laid the groundwork for a ton of crappy / misapplied management principles to this day that make many businesses an absolute hell to work at was a poor choice.  Does not reflect well on how you lead.\n\n\n* his story about being 12 and needing to get better at tennis, and he just has access to one of the best players in the world at that time was just tone deaf\n\n\n* the ending could be take as almost a veiled threat that all of \u201cyou\u201d (the grads) will be basically working for him.\n\n\nHe has definitely done some worthwhile things in his career, but it is mixed with some bad (depending on any individual\u2019s point of view).  All in all, I agree he was not a great choice, but schools always want to put up highly successful alums to speak.\n\n\nHe could have garnered a ton of respect by simply acknowledging the students protesting.  His line about needing to \u201cshow up\u201d.  Just pointing out how the students protesting were \u201cshowing up\u201d for the writers would have been enough.  But he simply ignored it which I think was a mistake and just makes him look much worse.\n\n\nP.S. congrats to all you grads out there, the last few years was not easy at all and good job making it through it.",

I'm not sure if there were snipers before then, 2013 was the first graduation I witnessed, but we've had snipers every year. We've had other speakers and honorees with secret service protection before too, there's a trap door under the stage for quick extraction.  \n\n\nSCJ Jackson only came on stage a few min before she was called forward and then I could see her immediately leave from the back with security.",

So now basically all my fucking classes are full and I\u2019m fucked and freaking out- plus now my advisor is out till June 5th. Is anyone else experiencing this problem?",

            "comment": "For everyone experiencing this, I just wanted to let you know your being fucked is not your fault; incoming students have a later registration date than continuing students, which is why most of your classes are full. Most of us registered as early as like April or something. Even if you had been 100% prepared and gone in right at your time, they likely still would have been full. \n\nAs for what you can do now, a few things. \n\n1. See if there are other classes that can fulfill the same requirements. You can go to your degree advice report on the student link (My Academics \u2014&gt; Degree Advice) which will give you some idea of what requirements you need and what classes you need to take. See if there\u2019s another class that can work (there\u2019s also a \u201cwhat if\u201d function so you can test if classes you\u2019re considering work, or if you\u2019re considering changing your major, etc)\n\n2. Start looking at waitlists. Some classes (esp required STEM courses) will have a waitlist listed next to them on the registration page. If they don\u2019t, find the professors email (usually you can just Google last name and department and find it pretty easily) and email them asking about a waitlist. They\u2019re usually pretty open to working with you. It may also be your advisor (I know for my major my advisor handles the waitlists for all the classes). Go ahead and email them even if they\u2019re not available yet - they\u2019ll get back to you eventually. \n\n3. Continue checking periodically. Sometimes people drop a class last minute and there\u2019ll be one seat open. You can always change your classes up until the add deadline (which is after the semester starts)\n\n4. Register for *something*. Get a full course load registered. Classes will only continue to fill up, so get yourself into something that at least sounds somewhat interesting. \n\nIt\u2019s late and I\u2019m tired so there\u2019s probably more and I\u2019m blanking. Anyone else should feel free to add.",

The only emails I\u2019ve received are deposit reminder( which I\u2019ve paid) and housing reminder.\nMaybe transfer student\u2019s are later because it\u2019s conditional offer and I\u2019m also waiting for final transcript to send to BU",

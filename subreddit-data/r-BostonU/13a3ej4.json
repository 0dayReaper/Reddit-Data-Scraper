    "postText": "ITS FINALS SEASON MY GUYS. Gotta stay lit.\nMake sure that you bring all ur friends to your place at 10 PM and pregame before you go out. Make sure you bring them back at 3 AM and wake up your other three roommates bc you think it\u2019s party time. Make sure you have ROCKIN sex with your significant other, like six times a day, making as much noise as you can, while all your roommates are studying for finals. Don\u2019t forget to let all your drunk friends vom in your bathroom and then leave it for other people to clean up. If they ask you to stop, don\u2019t listen, just tell them to suck it and go somewhere else!!! Who cares what they think!! This is sixteenth grade woooooooooooo!!\n\nAm I salty? Yeah, but you would be too if you\u2019d cleaned up someone else\u2019s puke and your whole dorm floor sounded like a sex tape was being filmed there.",

I asked her if it was possible to delay it to the next day and she ignored me, point blank. Ended up bringing like 20 people into our stuvi living room and progressed to party till 3am. I still dont talk to her but I will always remember how inconsiderate people can be.",

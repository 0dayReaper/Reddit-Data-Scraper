The thing with these stairs is it's dark it's at the end of a side street that's not exactly an alley but it's not busy Comm Ave either. And the blue emergency call box is at the top of the stairs. So if you got attacked at the bottom of the stairs you'd have to try to climb them away from your assailant to get to the call box.\n\nhttps://just-bu.tumblr.com/post/64385179828/what-are-the-rape-stairs",

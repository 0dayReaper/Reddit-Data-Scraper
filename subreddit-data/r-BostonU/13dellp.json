            "comment": "It\u2019s a variation on the writing curriculum. Instead of taking WR120 you take CC101 and 102. Instead of taking WR150, you take CC201. \n\nIt is a lot more work reading and writing-wise (about 8 or 9 books per semester) and about a paper every 1.5-2 weeks. It also has a final at the end which the normal writing classes don\u2019t.\n\nMy personal experience is that they are lenient on grading so it is easier to get an A if you put in the work, when compared to WR120/150 where it is more difficult.\n\nAlso they fulfill a crap ton more of the hub units that are hard to get as a STEM major(writing classes don\u2019t really), like I am a sophomore and i am done with my hub, which is a huge deal for gaining the flexibility for taking classes you want in the future.\n\nPersonally, I highly recommend it to anyone I meet, and I would do it again if given the choice. It is a highly enriching experience and the teaching staff is composed of the kindest and most well-spoken teachers at BU probably.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any more questions",

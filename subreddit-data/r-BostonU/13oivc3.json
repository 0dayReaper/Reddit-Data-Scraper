    "postText": "I've got an apartment in Allston pretty close to West for next semester, and I'm planning on bringing my own semi-fancy bike just to get to class and back, leaving it for just an hour or two at a time, parking it indoors at my apt overnight.\n\nI have a U-lock and cable, and know to secure front n rear wheels and frame, but I'm still worried about someone snatching it in broad daylight after seeing so many vids of bystanders just looking the other way while someone pulls out the angle grinder. Also just seen a TON of lone tires and lone frames in bike parking on campus.\n\nAnyone wanna reassure me or give some advice?",

Maybe one is near your classes. https://www.bu.edu/bikesafety/resources/",

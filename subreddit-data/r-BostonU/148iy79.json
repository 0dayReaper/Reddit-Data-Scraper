I check my portal and I have a 2.3 GPA. I emailed the CAS advisors and they said that the course cannot be omitted from my records and it will continue to affect my overall GPA.\nGPA is super important for medical school, so naturally I am very frustrated and worried. \nDoes anyone have any thoughts and/or advice?",

I can offer some advice here.\n\nright now, you have a 2.3 based on one course. I just googled it and it looks like BU uses the traditional credit hour system where most classes are 3 credits, so right now your GPA is based on 3 credit hours. that is an extremely small number which makes it much easier to bring up the gpa. like if you take 15 credits in your first semester and get a 4.0, your gpa will then be 3.72, and that's just after one semester. most premeds apply to med school the summer before senior year, so that's 6 semesters in. if you average, say, a 3.8 for those 6 semesters with 15 credits each, your gpa would come out to 3.75 which is barely any less.\n\none c+ is not going to kill your gpa at all, and the fact that you took it in 10th grade is going to make it matter even less for med school admissions. don't worry about this.",

From my recollection, the BU website clearly states that all grades and classes FOR THE DEGREE will count towards GPA.\n\nTo put this in perspective, it would be like starting a masters at BU after graduating undergrad and having undergrad grades count toward your masters GPA rather than starting over.\n\nThis is the type of argument I would make and I\u2019d push this up to the dean or program coordinator. Best of luck!\n\nAlso FYI if you are using the credit from the class to fulfill a requirement your case is much weaker. And in general as a pre-med at BU, I suggest extreme caution before taking any class. Thoroughly check the professor on ratemyprof, check the assignments on coursehero/former students. BU profs have very different \u201cphilosophies\u201d when it comes to grading and fair exams.",

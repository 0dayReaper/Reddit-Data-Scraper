There are recommendations for general students to help people get closer to their degrees, but everyone has their own path. Take what you want!! For data science, a DS class, MA123, HUB, and freshman writing is a great schedule!",

I think DS 120 would be a better choice if you've done calc, even if you don't feel like you've completely mastered it. I was a learning assistant for MA 123 and heard soooo many complaints about it being too easy to start, while the other half of the students with no calc experience were struggling through... DS 120 would probably be more interesting/rewarding. In the end it's up to you though!!\n\nBTW [here](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/programs-admissions/undergraduate/registration-guide-for-the-data-science-major%e2%80%af/) are the CDS recommended freshman classes, not 2 HUBs haha",

You'll be fine just refreshing derivatives in the summer briefly.",

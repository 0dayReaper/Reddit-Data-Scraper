    "postText": "Hey guys! I'm an incoming freshman at BU and was wondering how registering for classes would work. If I'm not mistaken, registration opens for freshman on June 1st, but there are all these little forms I guess I'm supposed to be acknowledging or something and I know I'm supposed to get an academic advisor. I know *how* to register for classes, but how soon do you guys think I'll get the email notifying me of my assignment of academic advisor? Or is it even an email? Am I supposed to like, check student link everyday? IDKK help pls, lowkey stressing \u25e1\u0308",

I'm an incoming transfer student in CAS, at the transfer student open house a few weeks ago they said that our advisors were supposed to contact us over the summer. But idk how early that means realistically.\n\nI've actually been trying to take some placement exams for like language classes but I know through that I haven't been added to the system for Blackboard and stuff yet. If I click degree advice report it just says I either don't have the clearance? Before it said I haven't been added yet. I'm hoping it saying like I don't have access etc. (rather than saying I haven't been added) is a sign that they're in processing of adding everyone now, but idk if that's me being overly optimistic.",

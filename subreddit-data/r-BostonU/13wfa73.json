    "postText": "I have been admitted to my Stony Brook University's CS program, which is pretty high ranked on most websites (T50ish mostly),  BU will be much more expensive, however, I am lucky enough to afford both schools and not have to go into significant debt to go to either one. On almost every single ranking page Stony Brook is similar to BU in terms of ranking, I am aware that nobody can decide for me in terms of where I want to go but I would like some input or advice in this situation. Some factors I heavily consider are social life, job recruitment/internship opportunities, course curriculum and ability to network. (I am trying to become a software engineer with either school)  \nI also have some questions for BU's CS program.\n\n1. Is the course curriculum really mostly theory based and hardly teaches any applicable skills for a software engineer? \n2. Do you have to do a significant amount of self learning on top of BU's cs program if you want to become a software engineer?\n3. What is the workload of the classes like? Is it possible to balance a job/fitness and school as a cs major?\n4. How is the internship opportunities for CS at BU? \n5. Do most CS graduates end up finding a job easily after graduation or is it a struggle? \n\nThe format of the post is really messy so I apologize for that but any input or advice would be greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "Sorry for text wall. I am a cs graduate from BU. When I was deciding where to go to school I also ended up deciding between BU and SBU. I ended up choosing BU but know some people who went through the SBU program. From what I've seen they are comparable. This is totally anecdotal but from what I have heard it seems that BU wins out in terms of social life. At my last internship there were interns that came from a variety of schools in terms of ranking and not only did we all have similar knowledge levels coming in it seems that our curriculums were largely the same. I would personally consider weighing the financial and social aspects fairly heavily as I feel from an education standpoint both universities will give you a really strong cs background with a lot of opportunities should you seek them out.  \n\n\n1. CS != programming and programming is not the hard part in my opinion. After introductory courses where you learn python/java you will have more than enough background to pick up a language and run with it.  I think its particularly helpful to have professors spending time explaining the theoretical concepts (I really liked the more theoretical cs classes but I understand that some do not). Theory is important for software engineers too- especially cs330 type stuff for interviews.   \n\n2.  I pivoted to wanting to become a software engineer kind of late in undergrad so I did need to learn some things on my own. Having taken cs courses though it makes this type of learning significantly easier. There are electives offered that teach software engineering and development skills.  \n\n3. You can balance a job/fitness with cs if you manage your time well. This kind of depends on the person though I guess.  \n\n4. I feel like internship opportunities are the same as they would be at SBU. Not really sure though. My friends here got internships and my friends there got internships. There are a lot of really cool companies in Boston to potentially intern at.  \n\n5. This also kind of depends on the person so I can't speak objectively on this. Finding an entry-level software engineering job can be tough but most everyone I know that graduated from both universities found jobs. Your personal projects and internships matter most in my opinion (haven't really talked about my time at BU much at all in interviews ever- what comes up most are projects and experience).  \n\n\nHope this helps! Best of luck in making your decision.",

            "comment": "hey, a theory based component of a CS degree is what you'll find at most highly-accredited programs. I'm a dev from BU. unless you go to a school known for CS (CMU, Georgia Tech, Stanford) any kid is going to have to do self-learning for CS, but that normally comes in the form of internships. The schools I just mentioned mainly just incorporate internships into the curriculum. it's worth saying, I also have friends who went to instate schools who are making just as much, if not more than the people I know who went to top 10 programs. Are you saying theory has no application in real life? Where else are you supposed to learn these theories? \n\nBU social life vs Stony Brook Social life is honestly like comparing 1% and 2% milk. they're different for sure, but they're in the same category. I did have a friend who transferred out of SBU for mental health reasons that were completely un-academic related. the campus of SBU is extremely bleak and isolated. They do party really really hard, though. \n\nIf you're looking for the get-rich-quick scheme with CS, goodluck. Any kid who actually enjoys computers and/or math is gonna make any important class a living hell for you at any school, because they simply enjoy it. Rankings and names don't matter at all outside of a select few schools in tech, and so all of the things you are using to decide are highly subjective to what you make out of any school you go to-- once you get there. If you want to be a dev, you'll wind up there regardless of these next four years. Who knows, you might take data structures 1st semester in and fucking hate everything about it (very very common)",

            "comment": "Can't answer CS related programs, but I think BU tends to carry more weight than Stonybrook, even if the CS programs are ranked similarly. However, both schools' brand recognition fall off outside of their general regions.\n\nNot to say you shouldn't pursue CS or SWE if that's what you want to do, but I don't expect either school will let you get a job \"easily\" based on their perceived brand in the current market and I would expect to have to put in a solid amount of work to prepare for and land an SWE position. Tech's experienced a ton of layoffs of late. (I personally haven't bothered to look at the specific roles/business units/departments affected in each round of layoffs.)",

            "comment": "Ok so in fairness I don\u2019t go to BU my little bro does and he\u2019s not in CS. But simply by the questions you are asking you are going about it all wrong imo. \n\n1) it should be. If its mainly practical then it would be programming degree and you don\u2019t need to go to school at all for that. The theory matters and a true understanding of it is the difference between a programmer and a computer scientist. There\u2019s always multiple ways to solve a problem but without a clear understanding of the why you will never know how to properly evaluate your choices in the field. \n\n2)Self learning is part of the job. It\u2019s really not possible to learn every stack and language out there. A good CS program will teach you the concepts (classes, OOP, encapsulation, control flow) as well as how to read an API. If you really have all of that down then picking up a new language really isn\u2019t that difficult. \n\n3,4,5) no clue not a bu CS student.",

When I graduated from a University of California school , I had three job offers.  Part of the reason was i got those job offers is I had two summers of internships on resume.   Secondly I had job experience at my school\u2019s internal and career center so I knew how to write an impactful resume and I knew how to interview.\n\nIn today\u2019s market, I\u2019ve heard of summer internships being cancelled by Meta 1 month before it was suppose to start.  \n\nWith that being said I know a 2023 CS graduate from Carleton College who got a job offer as software engineer from Boeing.   Pretty much every company needs tech folks. Expand your job search to look for non pure software development roles like Sales engineers, technical account managers , QA engineers, product managers, technical architects.  \n\nWhen I graduated 27 years ago, Microsoft, HP, Sun Microsystems, Yahoo!, excite@Home  we\u2019re hiring.  Hotmail and Netscape were small companies were hiring. In boom years consulting companies like Accenture hiring many smart kids even without CS degrees got hired.\n\nGood luck !",

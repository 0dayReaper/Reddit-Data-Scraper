Which of these classes have you gotten the most out of that I wouldn\u2019t find practical applications in a book? which ones are actually worth it. If anyone has any input on any of these classes I\u2019ll take it. Ty in advance: \n\nCOM 101, COM 201, COM JO205, COM CM217, COM CM 215",

            "comment": "COM 101 is fairly easy since its the intro class for all COM majors. COM 201 is also pretty easy but there are a lot of assignments and projects. They aren't difficult but when I took the class all the assignments were back to back. COM JO 205 is sort of a video production class. You learn how to use cameras, take photos, edit photos, use some fancy recording cameras and edit videos in Adobe Premiere. While the class isnt hard, some of the projects require you to go out and take pictures and make video packages about certain topics, so you might need free time during the week or weekend to do it. And, idk about the other two since I havent taken them.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am an incoming freshman about to register for courses and was wondering if anyone could help out. I am pursuing a major in Questrom and also a minor in CS.  I am coming in with AP credits in macro, micro, calc1, cs111, and stat.\n\nas of right now I\u2019m only taking sm131, a writing studio, and a seminar for KHC during my first semester. Any opinions on what else I should take?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthank you!",

It's not a method geared toward everyone's learning style but, it contains all the info that you'll need to know for the class taught in greater depth and detail. The other aspect of passing this class is understanding what information to filter out and what is needed. Whether it be for exams or even MCAT studying. \n\nThis is why I suggest to use lecture time to make note of what the professor thinks is \"important\" and then using that as a basis for your further self-study sessions.",

You should get the textbook as it\u2019s a great resource that goes more in depth than the class does, do note that the both 421/422 uses Achieve for HW, so consider that when you get the book. Or just try to find a free online biochemistry class, a lot of the important info was verbal and not on the slides, listening to the lecture is essential for learning if you don\u2019t read the textbook.",

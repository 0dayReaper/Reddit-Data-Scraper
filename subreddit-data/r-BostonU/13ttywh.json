    "postText": "I\u2019m getting an on campus job during the summer and one of the onboarding questions is whether I applied for a summer work study (they said it was highly encouraged). I don\u2019t understand what benefits signing up for a work study would give me as opposed to just earning the regular salary from my job. Will it grant me extra money towards tuition if I fill out FAFSA and accept work study or is that not how it works?",

It doesn\u2019t affect your actual job with the department, it\u2019s doesn\u2019t affect your hourly wage. It\u2019s just a technical thing on the backend for them so they need to know.\n\nAlso departments have a high incentive to hire work-study students over standard students, because work-study salary is paid I think 75% by the federal government. A non-work-study student is called a department paid student because the department pays 100% of the salary.",

I did it and they ended up taking away my work study for the fall (that\u2019s when I actually really needed it cause the office I work in during the academic year has limited funding). It screwed me over and it made it super hard to get hours for the entire year.",

    "postText": "Ok so last semester I had a huge craving for mac n cheese (the real stuff, not just kraft). I used to get it all the time from Bay State Underground but since that was closed I didn't have a way to satisfy my craving. And whenever the dining hall had mac n cheese it was usually like buffalo chicken style or something with meat in it, and I'm vegetarian.\n\nSo I started filling out the dining hall surveys asking them to make more regular mac n cheese every time they had mac n cheese that I couldn't eat. Because I just had to have some goddamn regular mac n cheese. In hindsight, I probably submitted a lot of these surveys and accidentally made it look like there was this huge demand for mac n cheese.\n\nI'm now regretting my actions and would like to publicly apologize because now the dining hall just makes bad mac n cheese every single day and I only ate it once",

And he said \"the students kept requesting mac and cheese so here we are.\"\n\nSO YES, IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE OF YOU",

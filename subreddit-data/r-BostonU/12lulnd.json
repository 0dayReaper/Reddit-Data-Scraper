    "postText": "As a grad-student teacher that reads student papers, please do not use ChatGPT. TurnItIn has an AI detection software now with a 98% accuracy rate, and the students using it are getting caught. The professors will know if you copy/paste or switch some words around.\n\nIf you know what's good for you, take the L on the assignment rather than fail the class and possibly get kicked out for academic misconduct. Don't jeopardize your future with one assignment at the end of the semester.\n\nEDIT: (Because there are some misunderstandings happening) I'm referring to people using AI writing programs as copy/paste/no-edit tools and submitting that. AI has its uses, yes, but don't let it write an essay for you. It's likely that you will get caught, and you will not have the evidence to claim the contrary.\n\nI understand that other tools such as grammarly or google translate can skew these results. With AI writing becoming so prevalent in academia, the software to catch it will keep getting better. User beware.",

                    "comment": "Another grad assistant here! \n\nAs it stands in my department, even if AI is detected, we can't do anything because there's no way to actually prove AI wrote it. Sure there might be detection software, but it's not particularly accurate - same as SafeAssign (blackboard's plagiarism tool); students' papers will often be flagged for plagiarism and after going through what's flagged, it's nearly always wrong. Of course when it is glaringly obvious that a student plagiarized or copied from another student the department does take action, but we also err on the side of caution because it's not fair to accuse someone of cheating when we don't have solid evidence (and an AI detector is not solid evidence). The only solution right now is to encourage the students suspected of using AI to add a bit more personality into their work. \n\nI feel really iffy about the detection software anyways because I've run bits of my dissertation work through it just for fun and it often flags it as AI written likely due to the nature of how academic writing is structured/sounds. I think it's foolish of TurnItIn to release a detector so soon into this because 1. they can claim it's 98% accurate but many teams have shown that AI detectors are not at that level right now, and 2. they *have* to know will be staff out there that will trust that number without looking into it further which only harms students.\n\nI know I'm saying the same things as you lol just wanted to say I agree with everything!",

The claim itself will curb a lot of to-be cheaters... \n\nIt'll probably reduce most cheating cases, but students could always just use ai writing as a draft, and iterate from there, which will probably remain undetectable (without significant numbers of false positives) for a very long time.",

I'm speaking to the couple student papers that are getting 100%-80% AI matches on their papers. The professors that I work under have conversations with the students and administration many times before these situations escalate to failing classes. \n\nWriting programs have automated backup saves that can be used as evidence, and this is the main point that I see discussed. If a student's paper goes from blank to fully 2 pages populated in 5-15 minutes with no edits, it's a pretty simple conclusion if they're flagged for AI.\n\nI also was a student that got flagged once, so I completely understand the fear of being falsely accused. I was able to prove that I didn't plagiarize. This was meant as a PSA for students that might be considering it.",

There\u2019s essays you can clearly tell are AI written, but there\u2019s some that really are difficult to discern. It\u2019s all about the skill of the user. There is no such thing as \u201cAI generated text\u201d. It\u2019s \u201cAI-mimicking-human generated text\u201d. How can you tell?\n\nIt\u2019s important to always consider the risks and benefits when it comes to using AI-generated content. Keep in mind that while AI detection tools may return false-positives, it is ultimately up to the administration and faculty to determine whether a student is plagiarizing or not.",

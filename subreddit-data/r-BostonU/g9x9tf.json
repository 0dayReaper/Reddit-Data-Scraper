    "postText": "I wanna preface this by saying that I know cheating is wrong, I get that. But I really didn\u2019t think I had an option, there was no way I could pass this final without using chegg. I know the chem and physics department are cracking down, but I was wondering if those of us (most likely many) who cheated on our DA 140 PDP final are up shit\u2019s creek? I just couldn\u2019t master modern dance, regardless of how hard I tried. The final asked me to perform a basic \u201cwhip and nae nae\u201d, and while I tried many times on my own, I ultimately needed to use chegg to find out how to whip and nae nae for my finals. I was able to Superman without the use of online tools, so would i at least still get the roughly 30% of my final that wasn\u2019t helped by the internet? Please I really need to know, I\u2019ve heard the dance department is really strict with this kinda stuff.",

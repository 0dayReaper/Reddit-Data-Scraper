Like I literally went in and there are just like 3 stations open now and I\u2019m charged that much. \n\nBoston food so expensive like why\ud83e\udee0 every time I think about this I just don\u2019t understand lmao",

Only graduating seniors and RAs get access to the dining hall that week in between, everyone else's gets cancelled (not sure why and it's fucked but that's how it is). If you have a nice RA or graduating senior friends they may be able to use guest swipes on you otherwise you have to pay this week.\n\nYou being let in was either a mistake or the person felt nice, also check that they didn't charge your account if they took down your info.",

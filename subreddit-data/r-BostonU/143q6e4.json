    "postText": "Hi, I'm a new transfer international student who is interested in finding a job on campus. So recently I checked the quick job and part-time job website. Tbh, I'm kind of confused. I know I need to have my I-20, visa and other immigration documents checking in in international center. But other than that, is there any other things I need to done?\n\nI saw I need to fill out a quick job survey and I-9 on employment website, do I have to finish both before I searching for the job? For the I-9, I finish the part one, and the part two is required to finish in person. So I gotta come to Boston for just finishing that form in order to get hired? Or can I search for the job before I finishing the I-9?",

You have to be a full-time student to keep whatever visa it is you get as an international student that allows you to work. You need 12 credits to be considered a full-time student. If you're an undergrad then your standard course load is going to be 16 credits per semester with four classes at four credits per class so you'll easily meet the minimum.",

As an international student you'll complete your I9 with ISSO rather than the department you'll be working for.\n\nMy department has student employees and we'll do interviews later this summer, including international students, and hire them. Once they're on campus for fall, we'll then do all the paperwork and send those required to ISSO to complete their I9. So technically it's more like a intent to hire, cuz you're not on payroll until ISSO is able to process that I-9, But that's just like the final step in the process too officially get you on payroll.",

You need it before you can actually work on the clock for the department but right now while you're looking for the job you don't need to do it. You'll complete your I-9 with ISSO on campus when you get here.\n\nI don't know of any other documents you might need as an international student. I was a domestic student and I had to accept my work study award as part of my financial aid but that was the only thing I had to do.",

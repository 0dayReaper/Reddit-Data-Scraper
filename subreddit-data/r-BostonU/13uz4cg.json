I'm just trying to knock out the philosophy and ethical reasoning hub units, so I'm debating between PH 100 and PH 251 and I'm just wondering which course would be better as someone who really isn't into philosophical-related topics.",

The readings are definitely useful and pretty important for the exams, but you can get by on skimming them wnd just focusing on taking super detailed notes of the lectures. I think its good with both professors from what I\u2019ve heard- I took it with professor Powell and really enjoyed the class",

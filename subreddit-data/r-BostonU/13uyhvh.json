    "postText": "\nHey everyone, I\u2019m subletting my room in Allston for the summer. Rent is $1200/month plus around $40/month for utilities, however I would be willing to reduce rent to around $950. 3 BU graduate guys will be your roommates. They\u2019re all very kind, respectful, clean, and easy to live with. Recently renovated, washer and dryer are located in the unit. Location is about a 3 minute walk from the Harvard Avenue T stop. Feel free to dm if interested, I would be happy to answer any questions. Thanks!",

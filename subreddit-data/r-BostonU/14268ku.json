Info [here](https://www.bu.edu/housing/assignments/changes/summer-room-change-requests-for-the-academic-year/). Submit that, and if something opens up, you will be emailed and have something like 24 hours to confirm that you want to switch. My understanding is that the people with the worst lottery numbers for the initial selection get selected for summer swap first.\n\nThis is different from direct swaps, where YOU find a person you want to switch with, since BU is in full control of whether or not you get a swap offer.",

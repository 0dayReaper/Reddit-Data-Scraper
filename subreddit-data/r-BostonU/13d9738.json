They should probably reach out to their academic advisor...\n\n'Most Boston University courses are not designated as \u201crepeatable for additional credit.\u201d The following policy applies to all such courses that are nonetheless repeated, e.g., because the student has not earned the minimum grade required for their current or intended degree program:\n\nWhen a course not explicitly designated as \u201crepeatable for additional credit\u201d has been taken for a grade, that same course can be taken again for a grade only once.'",

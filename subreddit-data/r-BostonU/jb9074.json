When I have a question that I've tried very hard to find on my own, or asking for clarification, and they're like \"as stated in the syllabus/this...\" and it either doesn't actually address my question at all, or part of my question is asking whether to go by the syllabus or what the professor said. It comes off so condescending.\n\n Like I wouldn't be asking if I didn't know, and yes I've read all the materials you've given me, but sometimes they aren't clear or they contradict, so I have to ask. If blackboard says I have a test on this day, but you said it's on another day, and the syllabus says it's on a different day, which is it?? \"As stated on the syllabus...\" idk if it's just me and a pet peeve or what, but it makes me feel like an idiot when I'm just looking for clarification.",

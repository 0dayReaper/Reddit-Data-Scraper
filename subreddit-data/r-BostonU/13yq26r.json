And I don\u2019t know what do I need to do now.\n\nI just saw a post of another freshman saying they have already registered for classes, am I spouse to do that too? or can I wait after I\u2019m done with finals and have already graduated? and if I need to register asap would anyone be so kind to assist me that?",

Hope this helps!\n\nFor registration, the first day for freshmen to register was yesterday. You can register any time from now until the first day of class, and can change your classes until a few weeks into the school year. Because of this, there is no requirement to register right now, so you can wait until you are done with finals etc if you want. However, some classes are very popular and might run out of seats if you wait too long to register.\n\nYou should try to get in contact with your advisor. They should have emailed you, but if they haven't you can look up bu advisors for your department online (List [HERE](https://www.bu.edu/advising/your-advisors/find-the-right-advisor/)). You can email or set up virtual meetings with your advisor to talk about your class choices and the registration process, their job is to help you!\n\nIf you want to register on your own, you can follow the steps that I wrote up on [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/13wnb40/how_does_registering_for_courses_work/) and there are some more info from BU [HERE](https://www.bu.edu/cas/academics/undergraduate-education/academic-advising/advising/course-planning-registration/).\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, I am always happy to help!!!",

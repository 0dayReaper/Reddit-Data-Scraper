    "postText": "I'm just struggling with the course work and career expectations right now. My second semester is almost over (grad). \n\nAs always I let my stupid mental health get in the way of my studies and now if I don't do exceptionally well on a final I might fail a class. And to add on that I don't have any internship offer for over the summer either, the market is fuck-all competitive. What's with BU advertising itself saying there's plenty of career fairs, but there's literally none. None. Well there were two, very early last semester, but it hardly had employers hiring in my field. \n\nAnd what's with BU not allowing co-ops, wtf? Do they want to wall us off from getting more professional experience? What in the Eldian-Marley Confusion is this.",

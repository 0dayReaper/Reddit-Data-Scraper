    "postText": "I was at a dept. meeting yesterday where the person trying to work on LFA and help the department navigate the changes burst into tears. The reopening plan focused so much on the optics of safety that the minutia of teaching a hybrid course in this new setup have gone untended. Teachers don't know what their classrooms will look like, there is still insufficient information on ventilation in some buildings, and new rules and announcements are coming every day making it difficult to solidify course planning. Your teachers are stressed af over their ability to teach in this system during a terrible time, the safety of their students, and the safety of the families they live with.\n\nSome teachers may bend the rules when it comes to in person learning. Some may only offer office hours in person, or set up a loosely defined discussion section to meet those requirements. If you think your prof is going more remote than they're \"allowed\" to, please, out of compassion for your fellow humans, *do not snitch them out to the administration*. They really do care about your learning and are working hard to make remote learning work better (remember that the remote learning in the spring was not planned well at all - most schools gave teachers an extra week of spring break to work on converting their courses, BU did not. teachers had about 4 days to transform all their courses to online courses, so you should expect improved pedagogy in online learning now that teachers have had time to prep for it).\n\nIf you think you are being \"cheated\" because remote learning isn't ideal for you, ask yourself whether your burden is greater than that of a teacher who, unlike you, does not have as much choice about returning to in person learning (of course there are those who need to return to dorms or for personal/financial reasons) and who is forced to choose between risking covid transmission and providing for themselves and their families. \n\nYour teachers know remote learning is not ideal for everyone, but it's the best solution they have right now and they may use it beyond \"official\" capacity. Don't rat out your teachers.",

            "comment": "I'm a faculty member, and I can confirm that faculty are trying their best and are working really hard. But the administration did not listen to us when we expressed our reservations about LfA, and they continue to exclude us from the decision making process. Many faculty think that the LfA model will actually be WORSE than completely remote for a variety of reasons, including:\n\n1) There are more opportunities for technical glitches (instead of just Zoom you now have room cameras, microphones, and projectors to deal with)\n\n2) Masks will make it harder for students and faculty to understand each other. Many language classes will be fully remote because their faculty pushed hard on the need for students to be able to clearly see the face of the instructor when teaching a language.\n\n3) Small group work is harder in the hybrid model. On Zoom you can easily make breakout rooms and share documents or worksheets. How do you effectively do small group work in person if you can't get within six feet of each other? I normally constantly move around the classroom helping students with their work, but I can't do that in person. I'll be trapped at the front of the room because of social distancing.\n\nHonestly, students should be prepared for spending a lot of time on Zoom, even in their \"in-person\" classes. Many CAS departments have done classroom simulations, and the best option for discussion-based classes is to have everyone on Zoom at the same time. It's really hard to teach to both groups simultaneously otherwise. And with some exceptions, students should expect to spend maybe an hour a week in the physical classroom for each class, on average. \n\nI'm dreading this semester. Not only will it be much more work for me, but I know that many students will be disappointed by LfA. It's impossible to create the \"normal\" classroom experience that I know they want (I want it too!). But I honestly could do much better if I were allowed to develop a completely online class. I get that some students need to be on campus, but I think that the overall learning experience would be better if most classes were online.",

            "comment": "I appreciate this post and get what your saying. But if all of my classes went remote after we were told it\u2019d be hybrid then yeah I\u2019d be upset. Not at the professors- it\u2019s not their fault and obviously its important we all stay safe at these times; however, the university had a responsibility to inform us of this long before anyone confirmed if they were coming back to campus. I wouldn\u2019t rat out the teachers but you bet I\u2019d call someone to talk about adjusting tuition- I know paying that tuition is supposed to go towards helping current workers stay safe, but isn\u2019t that what all those increased student fees are for? Plus, president brown is literally one of the highest paid university presidents in the country- sure he could take a nice salary cut to help out his beloved institution. \n\nTLDR: I agree it\u2019s not the professors fault for trying to stay safe and create a healthy environment for us to learn in, however, we shouldn\u2019t be paying those full fees and tuition if we\u2019re learning online because we\u2019re essentially using less resources.",

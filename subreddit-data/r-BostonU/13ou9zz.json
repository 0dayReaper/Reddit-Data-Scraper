    "postText": "Hey y'all... So I got my financial aid package a bit ago and it was NOT what I expected. I'm fairly sure I turned in all my financial aid documents and what not on time and everything. I'm low-income and $30k isn't what BU says they'll leave students with according to their calculator and website. I'm a transfer student but I'm fairly sure that doesn't change financial aid at all. I submitted an appeal a week ago but I'm worried that the most that I'll get is a few thousand bucks from reconsideration, knowing how a lot of appeals go. I'm thinking if this 30k thing is just this year and the next two years would be practically free than maybe I should do that but I'm not sure. I'm thinking that maybe after turning in confirmation docs like W2s there may be a huge change, but again not sure. Anybody experience the same thing? Anybody have a guess why this is like this? Advice?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Appeal was rejected. But it's okay because I'm attending a better uni and they gave me $90k in financial aid",

Meaning, schools can let in students with lower SAT or GPA etc, and these numbers don\u2019t factor into the formula USNWR uses. Why would a University do admit students who\u2019s scores may have been below the bar a few months/year ago? Because they\u2019ll pay. These students will not have the highest need in the eyes of how valuable they are to the university, and so they get lower aid.",

I think you\u2019re following the right path for trying to get more aid, just make sure to be persistent. They seem to keep aid locked in for all your years at BU so barring any major changes you will probably get the same aid as the previous year (a little more probs with increases to tuition). \n\nIt is strange how inconsistent financial aid seems to be at BU",

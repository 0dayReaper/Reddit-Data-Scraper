My main concern is, is that this year whenever I went to Warren i found myself eating really unhealthy foods so I was wondering what you guys recommend to do esp for someone who\u2019s main dining hall is Warren. Thank you guys a lot",

            "comment": "\n\n\nSomething I liked to do (and many others too) was go to the grill and ask just for the patty or go to the home cooked station and make a burrito bowel. \n\nFor warren I would always go to the stir fry station and ask for vegetables with no sauce (you can also ask for no rice)\n\nIf you are going to the stir fry station and want a sauce get soy sauce (I think that\u2019s the \u201chealthiest option\u201d) \n\nPersonally I preferred to ask for no sauce because I felt they put way too much. Instead I opted to add soy sauce on my own (there is a soy sauce bottle by the ice cream machine) \n\nMoreover I would try to follow a general template. Personally I like half of my plate to be vegetables and salad and then a protein of choice plus one serving of carbs.\n\nIf ur at marcianos one of my favorite healthy-ish deserts was at the waffle station! No, not the waffle. I liked to get some of the frozen berries and strawberries and then add some whipped cream. It was somethings nice to finish off with. \n\nThe main issue with eating in the US (as an international student) is that added sugars are EVERYWHERE (even in things like bread!). This makes food so incredibly addictive. \n\nI would keep note of some of the nutrition on the boards Bc sometimes it\u2019s shocking. Also consider how things like sauces, butter, oils, etc can add up (Starbucks drinks is a good example of how things can add up). \n\nAnother thing for me is to make sure u have a good mentality when going into dinning halls. Personally I would binge and eat a lot at dinning halls Bc I kept thinking to myself \u201cI have to get my moneys worth\u201d. What helped combat this was to look at the menu online before hand and decide rationally what I was going to eat and the of course follow that. \n\nI hope this helped! Lmk if u have any questions :)",

            "comment": "try to get stuff from the salad bar, sometimes they have chicken and you can have a lot of vegetables and fruits to choose from. Avoid high trans fat or saturated fat food/processed meat such as those from the grill station (too many fries, sausages, hotdogs, etc.) The stir fry station is always a healthy choice with a lot of protein options and a lot of vegetables to choose from. Making a sandwich at the sandwich station is always a safe bet if no other stations are appetizing/healthy as you can choose your own toppings. Finally, grabbing a slice of cheese pizza or two is actually not as bad as it seems as it contains a decent amount of protein per slice (12g per slice according to nutritional facts listed on the website). I honestly think it\u2019s easier to eat healthy at warren compared to marciano or other dining halls. Hope this helps.",

            "comment": "The more 'unprepared' foods you can eat from the dining hall, the better. Mainly I would suggest eating from the salad bar and getting a bunch of different things from there. My main dining hall used to be Marciano so idk if this will be as helpful for Warren, but I recommend getting big portions of the kinda standalone stuff they have and then supplementing it with the options from the vegan/vegetarian station. Like it would be normal for me to get a bowl of tofu cubes, a salad, a bowl of peppers, and then getting one of the entrees (pasta, chicken, soup).\n\nTry to avoid eating prepared foods from multiple stations in one meal. Someone else already said this but it really is important: check the nutritional info before you pick something. So much of the food in the dining hall is loaded with extra sodium and sugar, even in the dishes that you don't expect, and both of those take a toll on your energy and health over time. I find that prepared foods are usually the worst in terms of additives, so it's better to avoid eating those in high quantities (ex. I usually don't get a piece of pizza and a bowl of pasta in the same meal because I know that I will fill up with both of those, then I won't want to eat any vegetables or protein, then I will feel sick afterward.)\n\nRemember to check the 'extras' you're eating. Stick to water at the dining hall instead of juice or soda and avoid prepackaged snacks like goldfish or cereal. That stuff never really felt like they 'counted' to me because they weren't really a part of breakfast/lunch/dinner but your body still has to digest and break them down.\n\nBut also don't be too strict with yourself. If you eat well 80% of the time and exercise regularly, you can probably handle the other 20% with whatever you want.",

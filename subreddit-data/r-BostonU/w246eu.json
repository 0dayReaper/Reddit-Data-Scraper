You shouldn\u2019t have to endure subhuman treatment just because you\u2019re at work, and implying otherwise tells more about your character than about how \u201csoft\u201d this generation is. \n\nCollege isn\u2019t accessible to everyone, first off, but assuming that these workers aren\u2019t already in college is classist, asinine, and actually dumb. The labor market sucks, even for people with college degrees, and that is the fault of exploitative corporations putting profit over everything. Don\u2019t take it out on employees.\n\nThese people are the ones who make coffee for people like you. Not to mention they put in more actual positive labor than a stocks bro does. Keep any anti-labor feelings in your head, it does no one any good.\n\nSolidarity.",

Of course, I am assuming that they are in college. I mean it's a fact of life that you move up the pecking order as you gain experience, so I wouldn't expect to be treated like royalty at my college job.\n\nFor your information I am a college student and work at a gym where I am certainly not afforded any special treatment nor do I expect any, and if you want to talk \"asinine\" how about we talk about describing Starbucks working conditions as \"subhuman\". We want to talk about perspective? You're in Massachusetts, one of the wealthiest states in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, I might use some different vocabulary just simply out of respect for people elsewhere who are actually making $15 a week, not an hour. \n\nLook I get it, I am not some wall street finance bro who thinks capitalism is the most based system ever invented. However, we live in the real world here, yes there are flaws, but there's also a lot of things we are extremely fortunate to have. It just seems to me like this generation has largely lost sight of how lucky we truly are to live when and where we do. \n\nMaybe we can see eye to eye on that.\nCheers.",

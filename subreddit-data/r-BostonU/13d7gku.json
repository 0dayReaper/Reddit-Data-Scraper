I know it could be worse, but I did so well my first year at BU and stuff keeps getting harder (which is obvi expected). Do you think GPA is very important if I want to go into business/ finance/econ. Pls b nice \ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "From what I understand, once people graduate, most of them don\u2019t put their GPA on their resume unless it was really high. Or just put their honors. Feel free to correct me if I\u2019m wrong.\n\nHowever, most college internships do require a transcript and/or minimum GPA. And people who did internships have better chances of getting a job right after graduation.\n\nIf you\u2019re a sophomore though, just remember you\u2019re only halfway there. My first year at BU, I had the same GPA as you, maybe lower. Now I\u2019m on the dean\u2019s list (I\u2019m a junior). You already know what it\u2019s like to put in the work, so you can definitely do it. Just make sure you play to your strengths, and if you don\u2019t already, cross-check all your classes on ratemyprof before you register.",

I'm a transfer had to undergo a LONG appeal process but eventually was given a significantly larger amount of aid. I also asked professors I knew to advocate for me if needed. Just exhaust all your options and don't give up! They have the money, you just have to pry...",

Then you'll need to write a letter to describe your situation and provide any documentation that shows your situation. A letter from your non-custodial that says they will not pay for your education.  Your w-2 if you have worked in the last year, etc...  \nBest for student and parent or non-custodial to write something.  Non-custodial letter can be short.",

All January May and August graduates of 2023 are invited to the 2023 commencement.\n\nI had a D in one of my classes my senior fall so well in advance of May graduation and my graduate advisor reached out to me. I was still allowed to walk I just have to take the summer class and I got my degree in September which is when they mail it for August graduates.\n\nIt's not a matter of them disallowing you from walking. You're allowed to walk.\n\nOP if you want to be sure reach out to your department commencement coordinator. But you're allowed to walk.\nhttps://www.bu.edu/commencement/events/convocations/",

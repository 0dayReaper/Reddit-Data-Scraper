    "postText": "I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of comments and posts about how to sneak people into dorms this semester. I understand that people want to hang out but this is truly not worth it.\n\nA 21 year old in my city, that I used to talk to years back, died of COVID-19. All she had was asthma. She didn\u2019t have any huge underlying condition or disability, all she had was asthma.\n\nI have friends who are returning to campus (for reasons I don\u2019t need to justify for them) and also have asthma. They are going to be extremely careful, but what good does that do if other people are reckless.\n\nIf you think that sneaking one person into a big residence isn\u2019t a big deal, imagine what kind of issues that\u2019ll bring if 15 people have that mindset. Or 30. Or 40. All of a sudden, you\u2019re risking the health of people who have nothing to do with you.\n\nPlease please please just suck it up for a semester. If you really don\u2019t care and want to hang out with friends, do everyone else a favor and move off-campus. I don\u2019t want my friends to end up in the hospital because you wanted to see your friends in someone\u2019s room and not safely, outside.",

I mean compared to the rest of America I guess Massachusetts are doing better, but if you look at other countries it's not really great in comparison. For example, Massachusetts has 114k cases while Korea has 14k cases. That's a big difference in itself already but if you look at the difference in population between Korea and Massachusetts, that's where it actually becomes extremely worrying. \n\nKorea has a population of 51.5 million. Massachusetts has 7 million yet has about 8x more cases. And when you look at deaths, Massachusetts has about 8.5k to Korea's 300, which is 28 times more than Korea's. \n\nThe fact that Massachusetts with these numbers seems to be one of the best places in America to live is so telling that Americans have become extremely desensitized to these numbers and don't even truly realize how much the country has failed.",

Our infection rates are way down and our positive test rate is only 1.7% as of last week. We can\u2019t control how our country affected our outbreak but given our circumstances, yes, we did do a good job.",

It also doesn't help when the American government have not done the best job in recognizing and acting appropriately during this pandemic. \n\nBut from February 24 to March 1, Korea went from an increase of 230 cases in day to about 1000 cases in a day. Now Massachusetts experienced something similar in a week from March 22 to March 28 where it went from an increase of 120 to about 1000 in a day. However, the difference is that Korea was able to reduce the number of new cases from 1000 to 248 in the following week. \n\nI also must remind you that Korea hit 1000 new cases in a day about 27 days earlier than Massachusetts. Well for one, what the fuck was going on going during those 27 days? Did no one think preparations were necessary or something? \n\nSecondly, a month later, Massachusetts experienced an increase all the way up to 5000 new cases in a single day. So doubly what the fuck was going on during that month between 1000 new cases to 5000? Obviously this isn't only Massachusetts' fault. When your brothers and sisters from other states are suffering more than you, it does make it seem like you're doing a good job. \n\nBut when I see posts complimenting Massachusetts, I feel like the applause is being done way too early. You haven't even crossed the halfway mark and people are already popping the champagne open. And there's also a huge ass hill you're approaching which is when the college students return in the fall and schools for children start opening (I don't know what's happening with schools for children yet).",

Don't get me wrong, I don't think the USA as a whole is some star-spangled awesome at everything place, but there are a lot more factors to consider when comparing MA to South Korea. \n\nSome factors to consider: \nA. The virulent strain that was the predominant strain in both regions (we have seen that different strains have mutations that alter their transmissibility and fatality).\nB. South Korea having learned from MERS what is needed to quell an outbreak including having a plan for this exact type of pandemic from every level.\nC. Potential possible partial immunity for SARS Cov-2 from their MERS outbreak.\nD. Governmental differences that allowed S. Korea to openly deploy containment measure that would be seen as a privacy infringement here (not to argue whether it's right or wrong, but a clear confounding difference).\nE. South Korea had full support as a small nation to contain everything for the best choice of their nation as a whole, something the United States struggles with owning such a large land mass and huge population, making it difficult for every state to secure the tools necessary. \n\nAgain, this isn't to say MA did everything right, but they have handled what could have been a much worse catastrophic event as best they could while pushing back against their own federal government and experiencing a whole new disease for this continent.",

BU and Massachusetts haven't provided enough details or solutions for the coming fall semester (as far as I'm aware), which just makes me extremely nervous about what's going to happen in the fall. \n\nExpecting an decrease in cases in the early fall is just delusional, so the best case scenario is that the number of new cases stays consistent with as it is now. But the best case scenario is probably not even going to occur so we have to anticipate an increase in cases. Well by how much will the cases increase by? 50%? 100%? 200%? \n\nI'm not in Boston right now so I'm not getting the most frequent updates so perhaps my gauge on the situation is not completely accurate. However, Australia was doing relatively well but recently there have been another spike in cases. I would guess that complacency was the largest contributing factor in the rapid increase, and I fear that Massachusetts will suffer from a similar event.",

If we continue social distancing we will continue to see our good results, and while incoming colleges can change that, the whole point of this post was to make sure that this behavior is continued. While it makes sense that we can\u2019t say we\u2019ve succeeded fully, that\u2019s not what anyone is saying. What people are saying is that we\u2019ve done a good job quelling our initial outbreak. I simply don\u2019t see the point of this debate because no one is saying this is over- it\u2019s far from over. As someone who actually lives here and was able to see how bad it really was I don\u2019t see any problem in congratulating our hard work so far and encouraging its CONTINUATION. I guarantee you that no one from Massachusetts is remotely proud of the rest of our country. I have chosen to dissociate our success with theirs because we have local leadership that chose to actually lead. I\u2019m proud of Massachusetts, not the United States. Have a good day.",

My aunt and uncle were both in the ICU for about 3 weeks, my uncle was basically a chain smoker but he made it out alive, his wife however - who never smoked a cigarette in her life - didn't make it. They're in their late 60s but it was still a shock that an otherwise healthy family member could just pass away like that and now that we're hearing stories like yours about younger people getting seriously sick I'm scared to think about the possibility of a classmate having to be hospitalized because they were careless.",

People in social groups of peers may have a hard time following health guidelines at the best of times (eg. Non pandemic binge drinking), which is not to say anything bad about college students, but rather that when, inevitably, people slip up (as anyone might), it would be wrong to villanize them.",

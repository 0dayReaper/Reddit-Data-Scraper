    "postText": "hiii everyone! i am moving out of my on campus apartment and was wondering if anyone would like to pick up some (free) food if you're staying here over the summer! i already donated what i could to the food pantry but i think they took the bins out of the hallways already, plus i have more items that didn't fit the bu pantry requirements. i haven't taken stock of exactly what i have yet but some of the items include frozen fruit, frozen meat, assorted sauces, etc. if anyone is interested please dm me and i can give you more information (probably tonight since i plan on cleaning my kitchen section out after my exam this afternoon). thank you!",

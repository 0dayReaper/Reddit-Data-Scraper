    "postText": "I'm looking for a female to sublease a furnished, spacious room in a 6B2B apartment at Euston St (Brookline). There's in-unit laundry and A/C. You'll be sharing the room with one other female as a double. It's really close to the BU campus, Green Line B at BU Central and C at Saint Mary's St. There are also a lot of restaurants nearby. It's also within a short walking distance to Target. This place is extremely affordable at a fraction of the BU's housing costs while offering the same proximity and convenience as BU dorms! DM for more information as soon as possible. (Move-in date negotiable)",

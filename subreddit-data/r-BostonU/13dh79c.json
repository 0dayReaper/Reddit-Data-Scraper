    "postText": "Do people actually go to class, clubs, and the gym in 24 deg weather as much as during the Fall or Spring?\n\nI understand the practical strategies (wear layers, plan ahead, use hand/foot warmers, snow days/online classes). But wondering how it actually plays out. I used to live in a pretty warm town and people didn't even want to go out when it was lightly raining! Not to mention seasonal depression.\n\nBut I hear BU has a very active student life and of course lots of academics going on. So how does it actually play out? Do you just decide day to day if you feel up to going to club meetings and such? Or are determined no matter what?",

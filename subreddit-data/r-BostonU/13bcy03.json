    "postText": "I'm a current college Freshman and I will be transferring to BU this Fall. However, Right now I'm taking a semester off so I'm not sure whether I will still be a Freshman or I will pass as a Sophomore. Are freshmen and sophomores equally likely to end up in Towers? Since transfers are the last in getting housing, how likely is it that I get into towers?",

We are looking to swap into three singles or a double/single in South Campus, Whitestones, Stuvi1, or Bay State. Please let me know if anyone is looking to swap!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o3fbkc4j4y1b1.png?width=1348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3386d93365f540e2dc4214c8c01a54145f41e209",

Also dependent on if you have ap credits which seem to be almost necessary for this in 4 years. You will likely also be reliant on luck to hopefully have a good amount of classes in the summer.\n\nSo it MAY theoretically be possible, but it\u2019s very hard and dependent on so many things",

It simply was not allowed due to being too similar. It would be hard to triple major in fields that have zero overlap and you would have to really plan it out to make sure that you are not exceeding the maximum amount of overlapping classes. Right now a double major and double minor and was able to finish this in 3.5 years. Please remember that even a single major is an accomplishment in and of itself. You will have achieved an incredible feat no matter the amount of majors or minors",

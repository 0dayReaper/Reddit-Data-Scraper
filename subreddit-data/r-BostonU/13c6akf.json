    "postText": "im a rising sophomore at BU but i wanted to talk about something that kinda bugged me about applying to college. Mental health is not taboo in essays, so long as you've gotten over it. you *had* depression and *learned* from it. Suffering and surviving a mental illness is ok but its not ok to currently have mental illess. Does anybody else feel this way?\n\nEdit: I didn't write my Common App about mental health. What i did do was add someting in the personal/community circumstances section about covid and mental health explaining grades as was recommended by my counselor and an admissions officer. my point was that everything i read made it seem like i shouldn't say \"i suffered from depression in high school and still do\" but rather \"i suffered from depression but now im a better person because of it with more knowledge\"",

They are so so common/over done and there is always some applicant who has it worse than you. I just don't think it is a good essay topic period. Especially since BU unfortunately does not care about mental health in any meaningful way...",

I'm sure many universities do, but BU's classes are especially challenging leading to lower GPAs than comparable universities (and the grade deflation myth). Students come from very strong academic backgrounds just to be admitted to BU and have high expectations of themselves, which leads to a rude awakening at BU class.\n\nWe have had a few suicides in the past few years, countless mental hospital admissions, and multiple traumatizing events just this semester (a stabbing, a non-BU person smashing a window and committing suicide jumping out of stuvi, bomb/mass shooting threats, sketchy people on campus, etc) and BU responds with a lukewarm \"we care, get help uwu\".  Student Health Services hosts \"yoga night\" and hands out motivational quotes which are less than helpful. Everything is so performative.\n\nIf you have a mental health disability diagnosis, you will have to fight with DAS and many of the professors to get any accommodations that your doctors recommend. DAS is notorious for being unhelpful and often rude.\n\n[This post here really sums it up](https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/113xzgy/bu_needs_to_do_better_in_supporting_students/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nOverall, it is up to you to get outside help or SHS referrals, BU does not make it easy. Though I am not sure how much better/worse this is at other universities.",

I'm pretty sure I talked about a competitive sports struggle for mine. I don't know, maybe I'm being naive, but I always felt like colleges were just looking for skills/lessons learned from that prompt rather than a tragic experience.",

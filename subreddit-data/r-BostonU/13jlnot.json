She is understanding and as long as you have taken the prerequisite courses and have enough credits to graduate I don\u2019t see why not. Be cautious about the fact that you may have to stay a bit longer than your senior year to complete the program, not saying it\u2019s the worst situation but you would have to pay another semesters worth tuition",

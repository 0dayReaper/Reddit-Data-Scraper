    "postText": "Hi everyone, basically I applied to BU as a transfer student, but in the end I wasn't sure the school was a right fit (I had applied to other uni) and I would have had to translate my high-school transcript by an official translator so I just let it there without it. Now I regret it and I wonder anyone knows if I submit it now will it still be considered ? \n\nI have also heard that transfer sometime struggle with their transfer credit and cannot do double major/minors, does anyone has any feedback on that ? \n\nThank you very much for any help and have a great day !",

Note these resources are NOT just for those struggling with suicidal thoughts. If you are in emotional distress or any mental crisis, use these resources! Don\u2019t wait till it\u2019s too late to help yourself. Use and share these resources for whoever needs them.\n\nGENERAL RESOURCES  \nGeneral Website for Help Lines (trauma, emotional distress, domestic violence, SA/SH, SI, etc) (Call/Text):\nhttps://findahelpline.com\n\nWorried about yourself or someone else? Check out the JED foundation: https://jedfoundation.org/mental-health-resource-center/\n\nList of general resources for LGBTQ youth (greater Boston): https://www.bagly.org/resources\n\nbody-based coping skills and other exercises:\n[resources for resilience](https://r4r.energypsych.org) \n\n[coping skills 4 students!](https://www.anxietycanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/anxiety-bc-coping-strategies-v3-6.pdf)\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nCRISIS LINES (confidential)\n\nNATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE (call/text): 988 or 1-800-273-8255 [anonymous with licensed counselors]\n\ntext HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor \n\nFor LGBTQ+ identifying students, the Trevor Project Hotline is START to 678678\n\nBU Crisis Line: 617-353-3575\n Call the number and stay on the line (it will prompt you) to be connected to a licensed crisis counselor. I personally have used this multiple times and have found it helpful for short term distress management. \n\n(i understand some ppl have issues w text lines- it can be a little frustrating at times but it can be cathartic to vent to a stranger!) \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nFOCUS/SUPPORT GROUPS\n\nBU Behavioral Medicine has specific weekly [focus groups](https://www.bu.edu/shs/behavioral-medicine/services-we-provide/behavioral-medicine-groups/)dealing with trauma, depression, anxiety, Black support groups, Asian support groups, different cultural groups and even just mindfulness groups (yoga, meditation, organization and study skills, etc) \n\nthe [Justice Resource Initiative](https://jri.org/services/behavioral-health-and-trauma)(JRI) provides tons of amazing culturally-sensitive and individualized mental health services all over Massachusetts (Trauma-Informed Individuals, Group and Family therapy, School-based services, Yoga and Expressive Art therapies, etc etc). Located in Boston/Brookline and relatively inexpensive \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nthe world is a tough place but you are never alone! i\u2019ve been there and so have many other people. pls reach out if ur struggling. if someone doesn\u2019t provide u the care u need, DONT GIVE UP! there will always be somebody (crisis counselors, friends, family, n random ppl like myself) willing to listen.\n\nEDIT: note these are resources for distress management and are meant to supplement, NOT REPLACE, traditional forms of treatment",

            "comment": "Great list but BU needs to step it up YESTERDAY. They need to stop being embarrassed or ashamed about mental health issues and make the wellbeing of terriers their PRIORITY.  \n\n988 is the main number to call for help anytime or if worries about anyone. \n\nBU has to be willing to invest in terrier support campus wide and below are ways to do this . They used to be ACTIVE with JED foundation but never did what was needed and now are no longer \u2026 why? JED has templates for everything. When we take care of our mental health we all win!! And if BU invested / they would shine and be the example for all other campuses ! \n\nBU has NEVER been transparent or understood the need to communicate with support and comfort to ALL terriers about mental health - never understanding that talking about these issues and any traumatic incidents is not a NEGATIVE - it does not trigger MORE incidents - instead it helps reduce anxiety and fears and reminds us all that there is help out there and it takes courage to ask for help ! \n\n988 is the number to call when there are not enough counselors or support on any campus esp BU . For years parents have advocated and pleaded with terriers to BU to do better in these ways : \n\n1. therapy dogs as other colleges have ..not just at BU Hillel which has tried hard but they cannot be responsible for serving all terriers - they do enough for morale all year long \n\n2. hire more counselors !!!\n\n3. Mental health and stress management workshops IN PERSON combined with speakers and concerts and comedy throughout the year to show terriers that mental health IS physical health \n\n4. Retrain RAs and give them more support in dealing with mental health crisis and supporting students in dorms throughout the year \n\n5. Campus wide campaign as they did for COVID precautions with signs and messages everywhere showing numbers to call in emergencies, when just stressed and always including that it\u2019s OK NOT TO BE OKAY and sharing the main crisis line 988\n\n6. Retraining and offering support to professors and BU Police and all staff to successfully help and intervene with students struggling emotionally or after traumatic events\n\n7. Always implementing prevention and POSTVENTION when traumatic events occur to include system wide text messages and emails to all terriers and staff whenever needed in a TIMELY manner. \n\n8. Having an anonymous hotline to call if a terrier s concerned about another terriers and sharing ways to help them get help if terrier feels comfortable \n\n9. Offering wellness or mental health days to students more and the flexibility to have one chosen one per semester as needed. \n\n10. Campus wide anonymous mental health surveys that ask the tough but needed questions of terriers to measure mental health climate along with resources listed . \n\nAs a therapist, alumnus and parent the time for excuses and delays are over. Too many students have lost their lives, felt BU did not care about them or their wellbeing except for the tuition check, and BU has spent too much time worrying about reputation and stigma themselves instead of helping implement necessary changes to reduce isolation, anxiety, suicide attempts and suicides. \n\nEvery life matters. Every student matters. You are not numbers and if you are hurting, please call 988 anytime to talk to a licensed counselor. You can even call if worried about someone else.",

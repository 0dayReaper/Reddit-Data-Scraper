    "postText": "10 days ago I got an email from BU saying my guaranteed transfer application is complete after submitting my self reported midterm grades and the transfer college report. \n\nMy question is whether or not I'll still need to submit my final grades at the end of the spring semester to BU even though the email I got says my application is complete? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy guaranteed transfer offer was that I must complete two semesters at a college and maintain a gpa of 3.0 or higher.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy midterm grades indicate I'm well in the clear to meet the requirements, but I'm currently studying for my finals for spring semester and I was wondering how important my grades from my finals will be? Will BU still ask me for those grades even after telling me that my application is complete?",

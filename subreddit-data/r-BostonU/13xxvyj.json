What kind of arts are on campus, is there a good music scene? I feel like all I hear about is how hard it is to make friends at BU, is this true?",

So you might not have many classmates in the same major as you, or professors with backgrounds specifically tailored to your interests. Maybe it\u2019s easier to make friends that way though, since it\u2019s a pretty tight-knit community. I don\u2019t know. Good luck regardless!",

As for listening to live music Boston is excellent.\nThere is a theatre program here as well, but I can\u2019t vouch for how good it is I have no idea. \nGood luck!",

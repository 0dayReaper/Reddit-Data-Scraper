They\u2019re all very kind, respectful, clean, and easy to live with. Recently updated with new wood floors and bathrooms. Washer and dryer are in unit. Location is about a 3 minute walk from the Harvard Avenue T stop. Feel free to dm if interested, I would be happy to answer any questions. Thanks!",

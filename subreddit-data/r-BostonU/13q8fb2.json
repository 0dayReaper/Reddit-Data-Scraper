    "postText": "I\u2019m trying to get my gpa a little higher for grad school and I recently learned that course overload is free if you\u2019re a senior. Is it worth it to take five classes per semester? Does anybody have any experience with this- I\u2019m an Econ/CS major btw\n\nEdit: I think course overload is for people trying to graduate early/on-time. Since that\u2019s not really my issue I\u2019ll probably just take four classes that are relevant to my major and try to do well in them. Thanks y\u2019all",

            "comment": "Be careful with course overload if you're trying to *raise* your GPA. You've greatly increased your workload over 4 classes. It takes a lot of time and effort to push for high grades in all 5 classes. Consider the tradeoff between taking 4 classes and doing well in those compared to 5 classes. There's a big risk that you'll end up doing worse if you spread yourself too thin.",

I had a scholarship that meant I didn't have to work outside of my school commitments. Hence why I warn folks that it's possible but very demanding.",

You can always work for a few years before pursuing further degrees. You could even work somewhere that pays for employees to go or offers tuition reimbursement or discount (how I'm doing graduate school p/t at BU).\n\nYou can also gain experience working in your general field. For example, it's extremely common for folks who want to go to med school to work for a few years in an healthcare setting. This is a particularly good option for folks who don't get in immediately after completing undergrad. That time working in healthcare not only gives them experience in the field, but the opportunity to network and gain references. I know a number of people who did. A few who worked in health research even got a few journal articles under their belt. I gave the med school example because it's what I see the most, but it's absolutely true for other fields.",

Taking 5 classes is totally feasible and worth it, but you have to pick classes and professors very carefully. \n\nFind a class that you would like and check the syllabus to see the requirements beforehand. If it's 75% written exams or highly quantitative you probably want to steer clear. Gen ed 100 level classes can be good for boosting GPA if you pick the right one. Use RateMyProf. ALOT of profs at BU screw students on grades, so do your research. \n\nUsing this strategies I was able to buff my GPA alot by graduation and Im going to Cornell for grad school.",

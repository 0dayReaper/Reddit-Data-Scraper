    "postText": "This morning on my way to class, I saw one of the facilities workers who usually works in my building eating food from the dumpster out back. He is always super helpful and so sweet and seeing that just broke my heart. Does BU not take good enough care of facilities so that they can at least afford a warm meal?? Idk what to do at this point. I'm planning on getting him some Dunkins but idk what the next steps should be. Does anyone have any more insight on how BU treats facilities employees? Has anyone seen something similar?",

But please don\u2019t give his name out, or if you choose to escalate the situation don\u2019t tell them you saw him eating out of the dumpster. Sadly, we live in a world where he\u2019d probably be reprimanded for eating out of the trash + being seen. It\u2019s not a good look for the school. \nOtherwise, he\u2019ll appreciate the Dunkin\u2019 more than you know. Don\u2019t mention the seeing him eat for the garbage can! Just paint it as a nice, random gesture. I\u2019m honestly not sure what to do beyond the immediate. Whatever you do it\u2019ll mean the world to him tbh. You\u2019re a good person for feeling a sense of responsibility for this and I wish I could help more. ):",

Which, this isn't the fault of the managers of these locations at all. They're not bitter people or anything and they would help if they could, but they could get fired if students give away food and of course it's not helping much if I give one person a snack but then another person loses their entire job for something they didn't do.\n\nIt's sad :( but this the way a lot of food places are. I agree with not mentioning seeing him in the trashcan. Maybe OP can pool some money together with some friends to get him a gift card? Or if anyone has a lot of convenience/dining points, maybe they can buy some things at City Co for him? Like peanut butter, noodles, rice, tuna, granola bars, canned beans, etc., things that will last a while.",

Say that you appreciate his work, and if you're comfortable, I've found that gift cards to grocery stores, 7/11, or even to Starbucks can be helpful for those in difficult situations. You can't fix the overall problem, but I hope this helps. I'm sorry you had to see that and that he was forced into that position.",

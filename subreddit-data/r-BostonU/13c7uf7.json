    "postText": "Hi! I just got accepted, but I haven't made the final decision to commit to BU and I wanted to ask about how the transfer situation is over here. I wanted to throw it out there and see anyone's thoughts regarding the transfer experience as well as student life. I've heard that student life is almost nonexistent since BU is in the city, but I try to keep an open mind and thought to ask around. I'm 21 and from California and I've never been to Mass so it's already going to be a different experience, one that I'm super stoked about.",

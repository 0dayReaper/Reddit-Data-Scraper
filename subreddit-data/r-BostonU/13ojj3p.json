I\u2019m curious as to what was actually accomplished? Zaslav gonna go back to being literally the same identical person and yall go home with\u2026 the satisfaction that you booed him?\n\nSeems like nothing was done. Just got some superficial news stories that will do nothing to anybody\u2019s reputation. A few shitty photoshopped graphics that the average arts student can complete completely wasted in less than an hour.\n\nI didn\u2019t graduate. My perspective of this is very warped. I\u2019d really like to hear what was accomplished with the protests, the booing, the everything.",

Call it as you said \u201csatisfaction that they booed him\u201d. \n\nI think what they did was better than doing nothing and just stand there while the dude talks about peace, love and respect on the podium as it was supposed to be a speech for young graduates to go out in the world while everyone knows its all dog shit. \n\nSo yeah. Sometimes its just calling out on someones bullshit even if it doesn\u2019t have a huge impact in the long run.",

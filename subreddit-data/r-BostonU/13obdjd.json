    "postText": "I'm an incoming MSCS student interested in doing a master's project but I'm not quite sure how it works. Is it competitive to try to do a directed study with a particular professor? Do you need to have done research with that professor or taken classes with that professor prior to signing up for a directed study/master's project? Any other info would be greatly appreciated, thank you!",

Don\u2019t straightaway ask for a directed study class, but just request to participate in their research in some capacity. Then, you could ask them for a directed study after the first semester or the second with a concrete plan. \n\nOf course, there are professors who you could straightaway approach for a directed study and they do accept a small group in that way. This however might have too many competitors at that point. The first option gives you an opportunity to explore their research area and also prove your worth.",

    "postText": "So, I have a few years before before I can qualify and commit to either, but I'd love to hear from people who've done an honors thesis or the BA/MA program.\n\nI'm hoping to go to grad school and would love to get an idea of how useful either has been.\n\n**General questions:**\n\n**BA/MA:**\n\n* Did it feel overwhelming? Did you feel adequately prepared to start research?\n* How was balancing senior year and the start of grad school?\n* How was your advisor? \n\n**Honors:**\n\n* Like the BA/MA \u2014 did it feel overwhelming?\n* How was your advisor? I'm assuming they'd be more generous (understanding?) toward undergrad students, but I obviously have no clue!\n* If you went to grad school after completing the program did you feel it gave you a solid resume item/background in research?\n\nAny information is appreciated! :-\\]",

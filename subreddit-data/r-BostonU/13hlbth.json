I reached out to the professor on Friday when she posted the grade and she hasn\u2019t responded to me yet. I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s not going to respond considering it\u2019s summer now, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be too late to have fixed next semester. Has anyone had this happen? What should my next step be if I don\u2019t hear back from her?",

The online interview she had was pretty chill with basic questions about how to handle difficult roommate and housing situations and some personal questions about past work experience/life experience and how that will contribute to how well you can manage the floor as an RA. Overall, just be yourself and enjoy the interview process. Hope you can become an RA soon. All the best! :)",

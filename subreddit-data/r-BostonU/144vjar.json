    "postText": "Hello Terriers,\n\nI\u2019m subletting a room in a 2Bed 1Bath apartment on Bay State Rd. Move in time could be anytime after June 24th and the duration of stay is very flexible meaning you can move out any time before September. This unit is recently renovated. Place is furnished and there\u2019s shared laundry inside the building. Bonus point the mattress is yours if you want to take it when you move out!\n\nWho you will be living with: A female student and two cute kitties! That means I prefer female and preferably students or working professionals to sublet but guy is okay too if you are clean and respectful.",

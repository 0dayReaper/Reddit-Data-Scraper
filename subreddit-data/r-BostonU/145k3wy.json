    "postText": "Do all apartments near campus have either a bug or rat problem? And if not please direct me to the ones that don\u2019t.\n\nI live in Brookline and my apartment would be the best thing ever if it weren\u2019t for the huge big problem I\u2019m facing here. And pest control said that other than spraying every couple of months, there\u2019s nothing that can be done because the building is just old and they may be coming from the basement. Things have gotten so bad that I\u2019m considering breaking my lease early and canceling my lease for next year. But I\u2019m worried that there\u2019s no use in moving because at least I know what to expect here. If I go apartment hunting again, it\u2019s gonna be the same sugarcoated apartment tours and I won\u2019t know what to expect at the new place, things might be even worse.",

They also were at a lost for words on what could be causing the infestation and said that all they could do is spray and hope it reduces the issue. Apparently the building is old and that enables the problem.",

If they kill them inside, you'll just get more and they feed on other insects, so the beetles probably make for excellent hunting. They are harmless, but, I agree, very gross. Carpet beetles are unacceptable though. That is something your landlord needs to address.",

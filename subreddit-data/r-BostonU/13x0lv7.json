            "comment": "yeah, it's pretty much hopeless. what you're looking for exists, but it's not common and is snapped up almost immediately. accept the possibility of having at least one roommate and your search and life will be a lot easier. you're gonna get more bang for your buck with a 2/3 bedroom generally, and there's a lot more available.\n\nNewton depends on where you are exactly, but I would only accept that commute if you knew all your classes were during non-peak hours - bc the 1 hr by transit/20 by car is gonna be a lot longer during rush hour. Your potential social life might suffer too (not a lot of students live in Newton) Try Allston, Brighton (ideally east of Chestnut Hill ave), or Brookline (North Brookline or Coolidge Corner, not the village)\n\nCraigslist and fb groups are good options for finding places, but make sure you're not getting scammed before you send any money or personal info like your social",

    "postText": "Hello! Was told I could walk this spring despite taking an extra semester to finish up in the Fall, but was recently told that I couldn\u2019t be an \u201cexception.\u201d (Which is fine, rules are rules.) \n\nThat being said, I already bought my cap and gown. I\u2019d love to give it to someone for free, but I could barely afford it in the first place. I bought it for roughly $70 but will sell for $40/$50. If anyone needs it, DM me!\n\nIt\u2019s a black tassel for an undergrad earning a BS.",

            "comment": "I wonder if because you're taking a Fall class and thus your graduation date is Jan 2024 that's why you can't walk this year? Jan, May, and Aug graduates are all invited to the commencement in the same year.  \nEx: I was an August grad for my undergrad and was able to walk the May just before then. I was given an empty red envelope when walking (back when they gave you the diploma in person) and my degree was mailed in Sep after my program was finished.  \n\n\nAs a Jan 2024 graduate, you would be invited to the May 2024 Commencement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike the other person said, hold onto your gown if you plan to come next year. But if not, I hope you find a buyer!\n\nI recommend listing your height and if it's the standard gown size/width or the larger version so you only get replies from people who are looking for that size.",

    "postText": "Hi guys!\n\nI'm a rising senior in BME and it's been almost 3 years since I last visited the campus because of COVID + other personal reasons. So excited to go back after all, and tryna catch up w/ the recent events of the department (hoping to pm to any BME students if possible!).\n\nThough I'm still struggling to navigate my career path, for now, I'm planning to apply to graduate schools. I've done some lab internships related to Neuroeng. and Machine Learning in my home country, and pretty much enjoyed it, but would like to gain some more lab experience before I apply.\n\nCan anyone recommend me good BME labs where I can learn and utilize deep-learning skills? I'm also open to other options that are not related to NeuroE. or ML, so please share your thoughts!",

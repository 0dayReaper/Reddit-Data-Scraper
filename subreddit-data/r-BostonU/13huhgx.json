    "postText": "I (19F) had a hard time starting college, I entered on the Fall of 2022, and though I initially was on 16 credits I had to drop one of my Major introductory classes (which sucks because It feels like I delayed my Major a lot), and I struggled both academically and socially the first semester and I was in a deep state of depression which Ignored during the whole winter break. Once I started the spring semester I thought things would go better, but the universe seemed to hate me and due to a number of mental health issues I decided to take a semester off and transfer schools. I transferred schools from a small LAC in Ohio (where I was extremely unhappy and depressed) to Boston University. I like this school so much more, I think it will be easier to deal with my mental health in a place that isn't as isolated as my last school. However, I'm 1 year behind in my Major, minor, and general education requirements and I feel like a failure, I'm the 1st person in my family to go to college, and I've always been so dedicated to my education, I spent my entire life only studying as I had parents that did not allow me to interact with anyone for anything with the exception of school work, I never got to experience friendship with anybody as I was always home. I feel like everything was for nothing, I don't even know if I will graduate on time with my class or if I'll have to make another year/semester in order to catch up. I'll be entering Boston University as a sophomore and I only have 16 credits of which 4 are from an AP class when I'm supposed to have at least 24. I will enter my introductory classes and I'll be one of the few sophomores among so many freshmen, it just feels wrong and I honestly don't know how to stop feeling like all those years of study and all the effort were in vain.",

            "comment": "It's not bad at all. Heck, it's likely fairly common for transfer students to discover a few credits don't count at the new university. Every takes their own time to graduate, especially when you factor in mental health issues. Plenty of people need 5 years for the degree.\n\nI wonder if you're feeling pressure as the first person in your family to go to college. You don't have anyone in your family to talk about the college experience, so it can be tough navigating everything on your own. Be sure to take advantage of the [support groups offered at BU](https://www.bu.edu/shs/behavioral-medicine/services-we-provide/behavioral-medicine-groups/). There's a First Generation Students Support Group for folks exactly like yourself.",

Guaranteed you will find people/groups that are the same way. Not an easy process by any means, but if you put yourself out there, people will happily make you feel at home. Easier said than done, but I promise, you will be totally okay.",

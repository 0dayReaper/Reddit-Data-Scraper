After the cheating on exams this past year (people were looking at notes/googling), Naya said he\u2019s going to actually take measures next semester to make cheating more difficult. I honestly thought it was harder than 203, but other people thought it was easier",

            "comment": "213 is better than 203 in my opinion. It\u2019s both the same material give or take. 213 just has to read articles in discussion which helps in future courses tbh. I took 203 with beffert and although his exam curves are generous it\u2019s rough. He gives mcat questions for exams and it\u2019s a flipped style course so you have to do a lot of work outside of class (at least when I took it idk if it has changed). Flipped style (watch videos before class and come prepared to ask questions in person, and attendance is mandatory since he asked questions in lecture+ video questions+weekly quizzes). The curve is good tho but everyone gets a C but he curves to a B lol",

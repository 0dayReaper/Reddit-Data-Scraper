I\u2019m sure there are a lot of us that might feel the same way about going into work when you guys come back. Don\u2019t forget that your actions not only effect your fellow students and teachers, but effect us in a different way. There\u2019s been no detail to what we will be doing when everyone returns, but am pretty certain we will be disinfecting classrooms after each class ends. I personally have been doing my part in basically hunkering down in my home, and I understand it\u2019s different than a dorm room with no AC in most residential areas you guys are provided. But please try your best to social distance and follow covid guidelines. A lot of people that work in facilities are in the older demographic. Including my parents that also work here and I fear for them. We are here to provide you with safety. We would like to feel somewhat safe as well knowing that the students are doing their best in social distancing.",

It\u2019s selfish and disgusting to break the rules.",

And for facilities I\u2019m not even sure, maybe require that the room is empty but honestly I think disinfecting a room after every class is pointless because everyone knows 95% of how this thing spreads is via the air and not someone coughing on a chair or desk.",

They're not calling it an airborne virus because that would imply it spreads through aerosolisation, which is a medical term with a specific meaning. As far as I know, the evidence indicates that the virus spreads through respiratory droplets, which are smaller particles and much more limited in spread than aerosols, but aerosolisation is not confirmed.",

Respiratory droplets being spread through AC doesn't change the fundamental nature of the particles. Aerosols are much smaller and lighter, which means that they can remain suspended in the air for long periods and often evaporate before they fall to the ground. To be fair, the distinction isn't black and white - particles exist on a spectrum and even the experts seem to disagree on where exactly the distinction lies. But the fact that COVID is primarily transmitted in indoor environments suggests that the main source of spread is large droplets and not aerosols. \n\nBtw, I highly recommend browsing r/COVID19, which is a sub dedicated to the scientific literature on the virus. Not much sensationalism or bullshit there - the primary texts are from academic sources and there are plenty of well-read people to help explain or critique.",

The other thing is that nobody to my knowledge knows how far a viral particle can travel outside under different weather conditions (more humid vs dry conditions). I still think that we are engaging in a circular argument. The fact remains, until someone establishes the average half life of the current coronavirus by labeling it with a fluorescent market to visualize it under different sets of conditions both in indoor and outdoor settings under different weather conditions, nobody really has a solid answer. Most rooms are not 100 percent dry or 100 percent humid, it\u2019s a gradient and there\u2019s usually humidity which in my opinion, provides an opportunity for the virus to remain airborne. I think if the room was 100 dry, I don\u2019t think the virus would be able to travel in enclosed spaces and add to that that people use air conditioning during warmer temperatures, I think that changes the indoor weather conditions of the virus to remain airborne for longer periods of times.",

All of the discussion of safety measures the university is taking are prioritizing students, with faculty as second-fiddle and staff as an afterthought. That makes sense in terms of the sheer volume of students compared to faculty/staff, but I\u2019m appalled (not surprised, but appalled) at how BU administration seems to view us as expendable. And it\u2019d be one thing if they actually had an effective plan in place to protect students, but weekly testing and relying on individuals to maintain social distancing is going to be like using Silly Putty to plug a hole in a sinking ship. And we\u2019re not even getting hazard pay to add insult to injury. Either way, if they keep insisting on opening, I only see it going one of two ways: best-case scenario, they\u2019ll start hemorrhaging staff a few weeks into this as people are forced to choose between their jobs and their health, grinding the University\u2019s operations to a halt before too many people get sick. Worst-case scenario, cases keep rising through the fall until they have no choice but to go online-only by year\u2019s end, putting god knows how many people at risk just to end up making the same decision they could\u2019ve made months prior.\n\nI don\u2019t want to blame students for this, you\u2019re not the ones pushing ahead while cutting benefits and slacking on providing PPE. But no matter how much BU talks about their bold plans to get things back to normal, there\u2019s a shitshow on the horizon, and I just hope it\u2019s a labor dispute rather than an increased COVID casualty count.",

If I was in BU\u2019s position, I\u2019d just sell all the student buildings to a billion dollar real estate business to convert the space into a bunch of luxury apartments. There\u2019s no money to be made trying to bring the students back and trying to learn in these small apartments, considering how unsafe these old apartments are. It still literally blows my mind that there is no elevator in the apartment I live in, which makes it next to impossible to move out of my apartment safely without requiring assistance that allows me to maintain social distancing. Also, my apartment currently has mice so the apartments won\u2019t even be free of mice if new students move in. Mice carry diseases and I am allergic to them, so it brings me great pleasure that I will be moving the fuck out of this place. I would not be surprised while reading the newspaper later this year if they resort to laying off some maintenance employees.",

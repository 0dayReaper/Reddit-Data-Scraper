    "postText": "I want to do a CDS minor but I'm super confused. So you need 24 credits, and the pre-req is 4, foundations is 8, and core is 12. That's already 24, so what's the point of having an electives section? At least on degree advice, it doesn't show the minor as complete if you only do 8 credits in core and do an elective for the final 4 credits, so can someone help me out? Am I allowed to do electives instead of core/foundation courses or do I have to do the full 8 credits in foundations and full 12 credits in core.",

            "comment": "The Marine Program is excellent - I don't know anyone who's participated in it who hasn't enjoyed it. I'm not sure what you already know about it, but here are a few things:\n\n* It consists of 4 month-long block classes (one in Sep., one in Oct, etc.). This means you are only taking one class at a time. The classes meet pretty much all day every day, and the format allows lots of time for field trips, boat trips, and days in the lab. Lectures and traditional classroom assignments are de-emphasized, but several of the classes have group research projects and presentations at the end.\n* The pace can be exhausting, but rewarding and never boring. For example, because the courses are so short, you might have several field trips in one week, with early start times and late finishes, and then on the non-field trip days, you are in the lab or processing your data on the computer. \n* You become really close with the rest of your marine semester cohort, especially if you do any of the classes where you get to travel (like to Belize, as some of the Nov. and Dec. blocks do).\n* There are generally 3 or 4 options for each block, so you can choose classes that appeal to you. Some of them are really popular though, so you have to list your second and third choices too, and they try to give you a schedule that you'll be happy with.\n\nIf you have any specific questions, I'm happy to try and answer them!",

(I will be a senior in the incoming year and will be graduating with marine major)\n\n  \nYeah, I'm about to complete that semester that was described to you by sabla in comment. But what they were talking about specifically is called the \"Marine Semester\". \n\n  \nExcept for that one really hands-on semester, all other semesters are normal and you'll be working on your prerequisites and such.   \nThe one difficult thing about pursuing a marine science major that u should be prepared for is all the prerequisites. You will need two semesters of Bio, two semesters of chem, one of physics, three of math (one of your math credits can be a computer science course). And of course the marine science classes themselves and the 'marine semester'.\n\n  \n It is a lot to do and especially chem hard at BU but if you are up for the challenge, it is amazing to be able to graduate as a Marine Scientist. There are soooo many rewarding jobs in the field; just need to get through all the difficult/tedious prereqs. I wished someone warned me about how much work it is to get all the degree requirements so I thoughts I'd do that for you.  :)",

I took a calc class freshman year before I transferred and it got counted for a math so then (because I hate math too) I took a statistics class for the second math credit (which was pretty easy) and a Computer Science intro to programming class for the last math credit so basically I took the least-mathy path haha",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a film &amp; tv major and plan to also do a major in business. I was wondering which one of these is better to take. I\u2019m looking more at marketing, management, or law rather than something like accounting. Will CALC 121 be less useful (preq wise) for other classes. Is one harder/ more of a weed out class than the other. What Professor do you recommend, right now I\u2019m looking at Enkosky. Thank you",

            "comment": "MA121 and MA123 give the same credit for business classes, so they both SHOULD be sufficient and SHOULD start at the same place. MA123 is a more challenging class, and there is a very wide range of students who take MA123, from math majors who already know the content to students who didn't take even precalc. I would not call MA123 a weed out class, but it is a harder class that you will need to spend a good amount of time on.  MA121 is more directed toward biology and social science students. \n\nMA123 has been taught by every professor in the math department. It gets traded off because none of them are really passionate about intro calculus... Look at Rate My Professor for this semester's options.\n\nOverall, you will be able to succeed either way and will get the knowledge you need out of either class. You know yourself best! You can always switch to the other class in the first few weeks if you think it isn't a good fit.",

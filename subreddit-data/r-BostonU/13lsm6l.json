Others might be leaving in anticipation that the new President will want to hire their own picks for top slots at the University.",

So they are excessively (and negligently) deflating student grades.  For example a B+ is something like a 94-95%. \n\nA friend of mine just finished her last semester in the online MBA program now and apparently the students had a big \u201cuprising\u201d of e-mails and personal complaints. BU quelched it by sending a big threatening message from the executive director of the program to all the students to \u201cStop complaining about the grades\u201d.  I saw a screenshot and it was F**king ridiculous. \n\nIn the end grade deflation is taking money out of peoples pockets. People missing out on good grad schools and other opportunities because of it. So the rats are fleeing a sinking ship, and when a class action lawsuit comes in they will be paying out millions. I assume that some people, probably the people that made this decision,  are fleeing any potential backlash.",

    "postText": "hello! im likely transferring to BU this fall but admissions still hasnt evaluated all of my credits.\n\nfor context, im transferring from a CC so i should be in my third year by the time i get to BU. \n\nim wondering if anyone has any insight as to why they havent evaluated all my credits yet? im slightly concerned that all my creds won\u2019t transfer over and i wont be considered class of 25 here. has any one experienced something similar if you\u2019re also a transfer student?\n\nthank u!!",

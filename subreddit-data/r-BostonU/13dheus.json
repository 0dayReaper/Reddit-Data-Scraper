TIA\n\nSo...\n\nHow much interaction with the medical school is there (since the program highlights being at a medical school as a big pro)?\n\nWhy did you choose BU compared to other schools (especially considering the high cost?)\n\nDo you think it's realistic to work full time while doing part-time classes?\n\nAnything you especially like or don't like that you wish you'd known before starting?\n\nThoughts on the faculty?\n\nHow helpful were they with getting internships and jobs? \n\nHow helpful with thesis guidance?\n\nHow does being in Boston impact your experience, both good and bad?",

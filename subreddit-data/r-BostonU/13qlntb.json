    "postText": "Hi! I paid the deposit on time for grad housing but I submitted my application late. I'm on the waitlist and I was wondering if anyone's been in that situation / if getting off the waitlist is likely or not? \n\nI've called grad housing numerous times and they've told me that they don't know if/when I'll hear back and that they can't give me an estimated time or what spot I am on the waitlist. \n\nTLDR: I'm on the grad housing waitlist and I'm really stressed because I have no other housing options currently",

She found a Facebook page for incoming students and ended up getting into a 4br apartment in Brighton with her best friend and two others she met on that site. You may want to start looking for something like that.  Her portion ended up being $1025/m plus electric and its the 2nd/3rd floors of a large house, with onsite parking. Deals seem to be out there. Good luck!",

If we are able to offer a space to students on the waitlist, you will be prompted to pay the Housing Guarantee Payment, select a unit, and sign the Residence License Agreement.",

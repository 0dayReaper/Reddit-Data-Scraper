Does anyone have any experience with this / tips? I've been cold emailing professors but I haven't had any luck yet. Should I just keep doing this or is there a better way?",

            "comment": "I think cold emailing is your best bet, though the timing is a bit late. Since you\u2019re a rising sophomore and have been finishing up basic requirement courses, you probably don\u2019t have strong connections with professors in your area yet. \n\nI would suggest contacting a broad range of labs. The specific work that a lab does doesn\u2019t matter too much for you right now. You\u2019re there to get a taste of research, see how a lab operates, and gauge the department and school research resources.",

            "comment": "Cold emailing isn\u2019t ideal. What is ideal is to be in the professor\u2019s class and to make a good impression, make yourself known at office hours, and to express interest. Some professors only take students through the courses they teach. \n\nIf cold emailing is your only option, there\u2019s lots you can do to stand out. Most professors will get emails from dozens of students a semester and most professors will turn away most if not all of them. You can put the odds in your favor by reaching out to new professors who are just getting established. You can also stand out by actually showing interest in and knowledge of their research along with a compelling set of details as to why you\u2019d be great in their lab.\n\nSomething you should know is that professors aren\u2019t looking for warm bodies and pretty much every undergrad is a net negative on the lab at first (some more than others). They take undergrads with the hope that they\u2019ll work hard and stick around for 2-3 years and become actually useful at some point. They don\u2019t expect anything of you but if you can demonstrate you\u2019re responsible, reliable, and a quick learner in for the long haul then you\u2019ll likely reach that \u201cnet positive\u201d moment more quickly and thus thus more likely take you.\n\nJust be careful in the bio department: they\u2019re known for having some real stinkers esp. if you\u2019re interested in neuroscience. Ask around about the profs reputation before joining.",

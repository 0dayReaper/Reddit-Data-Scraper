    "postText": "I'm an incoming transfer student and saw that on-campus housing is guaranteed for transfers. Does anyone have input on whether this is worth it in terms of money/location/etc, and if most transfer students choose on or off campus? For the record, I am 22 and have lived off campus at my last school, and am currently living in an apartment in the Boston area. So, I'm used to living on my own and I don't want to go back to on-campus housing with a bunch of 18 year olds and feel like it sucks/ there's no independence, etc, if that makes sense. On the other hand, if on campus housing is a big bonus and what most students choose, then I'd lean towards doing that. \n\nThanks for any advice!",

Otherwise the current housing system is horrible if you have any issues with your room or your roommate. They don\u2019t help you at all. If they do, the help is very slow or doesn\u2019t help the situation at all. Also all the singles are pretty much gone so you\u2019d probably be living in the same room with someone, which I don\u2019t know about you, but for most is generally stressful. If you aren\u2019t getting a lot of aid off campus is probably more cost efficient anyways.",

BU is charging more than an apartment with a kitchen and you\u2019d have to be in a room with another person. (I\u2019m 25) I will never go back to living in the same room as someone for MORE money. Heck no.",

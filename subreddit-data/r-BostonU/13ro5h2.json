It asked for examples from existing models of healthcare systems around the world and we watched a whole entire documentary about at least 6-7 different models. The word requirements were quite short and the TFs can definitely guide you through ideas.",

There was a fair amount of reading but it was all very relevant and didn\u2019t feel like busy work. There are only a few assignments in the class but I felt there was adequate instruction on how to approach them. The discussion sections were helpful and the TFs were approachable and also clearly cared about the teaching. I didn\u2019t personally come in with much knowledge about the healthcare system (I\u2019m not in stem or premed or anything) and while there was some specific discussions that might require technical knowledge, I feel the class as a whole was more focused on the policy and human aspect of healthcare, rather than the hard science or clinical aspect.",

I don\u2019t remember exactly but there were also two written assignments and some participation stuff like posting in the class Slack channel. There was also a discussion assignment where you signed up one week to present on a topic with a partner. Not super involved or anything.",

    "postText": "so i\u2019m an incoming transfer student (sophomore) and i\u2019m trying to explain to my parents that off campus housing is probably better and more cost efficient, but they\u2019re completely disregarding what i\u2019m saying. i figured with the mandated meal plan it\u2019s not really worth it, (i would never use it- i have way too many food sensitivities and got extremely sick from my schools dining hall this past year) plus i had an awful roommate experience last year and i am terrified to go through that again. id rather have my own room at the very least. please help me\u2026 is on campus housing worth it? or am i right and is off campus better? \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29",

PDPs are 1 credit each. I've taken fat burn, Tai chi, healthy cooking, yoga, rock climbing, sailing, aqua aerobics.\n\nI wish I took more PDPs. I wish more had fit in with my class schedule so I could have taken more. They were always fun.",

Aqua aerobics was also really fun and a good workout and I didn't feel gross/sweaty because we were in the pool.\nNote that PDP classes are either once or twice per week, so if you want multiple workouts each week, take more than one class or take what you learned in class and do it on your own at FitRec.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I was accepted about a week and a half ago as a transfer and I really want to attend, but the finaid package they gave me was so unrealistic (EFC \\~$16k they gave me $30k). I've submitted an appeal and included my parents most recent tax returns as our income dropped substantially, as well as some hefty medical bills, but I don't know how helpful this will be or how generous BU will be with appeals. \n\nCan anyone offer some advice as to what else I can do to get more aid if the appeal doesn't result in what I'm looking for?",

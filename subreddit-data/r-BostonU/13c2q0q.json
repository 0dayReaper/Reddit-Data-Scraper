    "postText": "Hey guys, just wanted to post and let y'all know that I'm doing grad photos for (after observing what others have been paying) fair pricing. Just want to cover costs and make sure people get photos commemorating their achievement!\n\nMy equipment:\n\n* Canon M50 Mk II\n* Lenses: 16mm f1.4, 30mm f1.4, 50mm f1.2\n* Tripod (if necessary)\n* Lights (if necessary)\n\nMy specialty is 3/4 and 1/2 body portraits, but I'm flexible in getting you what you want. I'm a student like you (or like you were) and not a professional so be prepared to brainstorm ideas with me!\n\nFor privacy reasons I don't want to post the pictures I've already taken publicly, but if you DM me I'll give you the password to access some samples at [loganchoi.com/samples](https://www.loganchoi.com/samples). Feel free to look around at my other photos [here](https://loganchoi.com/gallery) (it's mostly product photography since there's no privacy issues there haha).\n\nIf too many people ask to get their photos taken it'll be too much of a workload for me to edit everything so I'm setting the price at **$100 for the first five people** and **$150 for the next five**.\n\nThis is for a 30-90min session (depends on how fast we get everything we want).\n\nI may decide to not accept any more work if there's too many requests; I'll edit this post to reflect that if it comes to it.\n\nIf you're interested feel free to DM me and I'll show you the samples and we can schedule a time and date.\n\nEDIT: Availability right now: this week and the weekend, not available next week",

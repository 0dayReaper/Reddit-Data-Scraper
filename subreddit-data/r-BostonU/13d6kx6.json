    "postText": "I had 90+ meal swipes left for the semester, tried to swipe in 2 friends with me for dinner. The lady stopped us and started to yell at us that I cant swipe my friends in, and that I have to pay 18.90 per person. I only had 1 guest pass left so I used it for one of my friends, and was forced to pat 18.90 conv pts for the other. Im already draining more than $1500 down with the unused swipes and this happens to me. Ridiculous",

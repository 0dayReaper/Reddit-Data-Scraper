    "postText": "I was accepted as a transfer and am currently waiting on my financial aid offer, I submitted css around two months after the deadline(ik I\u2019m an idiot idk how I forgot) and apparently they never received my FAFSA even though I filled it out early in the year and put their school code, I\u2019m just wondering if I would get less aid than I originally would\u2019ve gotten because of this. Has anyone been in a similar situation and gotten a good aid package anyway?",

They probably won\u2019t give you as much this first semester, you can try appealing though, but they should in the following semesters if you appeal second semester and apply on time following semesters.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,  \nI got an admit into MSCS program at BU MET for fall23, I've been searching stuff online but I am not able to get some concrete information.  \nI need some info regarding :  \n1. TUITION : as an international student I am required to take full time only until my last semester which I can do in part time. can someone tell me how much  would I be paying if I take the course in 4+4+2 fashion? And can one do 3 subs in their final semester as part time or is 2 the set limit for all the part time semesters?  \n\n\n2. COMPLEXITY : as good as it sounds, I am skeptical about the work load and how hard the subjects are at BU. Is a 4 sub semester too heavy? If it is heavy then are there any ways for me to make it easier?\n\nAny information is appreciated, i am so confused.",

Yes. \nBut it\u2019s very doable.\nMET has a fairly easy syllabus compared to GRS and CAS\nSo you\u2019ll be fine.\nTake 4,4,2 (you save money)",

You can pull now.*\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.\n\n*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*",

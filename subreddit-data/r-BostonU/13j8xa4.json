Don't let what you learned in 112 slip over the summer and use your knowledge from your first attempt at the course to get ahead on material! You're going to have a lot of problem sets with these particular 3 cs classes.\n\nIt is better to take two cs classes and pass both than take three and pass less than two / retain less information / need more retakes. Make sure your schedule is within YOUR limitations, only you know what you are capable of, but I know that this course load is possible if you put your mind to it!!\n\nBest of luck!",

            "comment": "I actually had a pretty positive experience with Fenway Campus. A lot of people hate on it because it\u2019s not on Comm Ave with most other dorms but it\u2019s really not as far as people make it out to be\u2014maybe a 10 minute walk to Central Campus if you walk fast. Also the dining hall is the best on campus with delicious food and great staff.\n \nAdmittedly, it can feel a little isolating at times because you\u2019re actually in Boston when you step outside, not BU campus. Honestly I liked how peaceful it was and you\u2019re close to Fenway stadium/Target/bars in the area so it\u2019s not awful. One note though: the shuttle is unreliable and I almost never took it to class. Housing told me they were working to improve it which was a lie. \n \nOverall it has it\u2019s pros and cons, it just depends what you personally are looking for. In my experience it was a lot more pleasant than I expected based on all the shit it gets. Just my two cents.",

            "comment": "It's across the street from the Simmons campus and Time Out market. There are four campus buildings, two of which have been renovated. It was previously the Wheelock College campus before BU bought them in 2018, and now it's mainly (at least this past year) been CGS students, transfers, exchange students, and those that got poor housing numbers like me lol.\n\nRiverway is nice and renovated. Quality is good and the dining hall is quite lovely as well. I only wanted to move out because it's very isolated from the rest of the campus. There are no study spots as they've permanently locked the library to students, and removed the on-campus Starbucks. The location isn't bad though, 5 minute walk to the Fenway Target.\n\nShuttle isn't very reliable, and they stopped service May 5th which really sucked with finals.",

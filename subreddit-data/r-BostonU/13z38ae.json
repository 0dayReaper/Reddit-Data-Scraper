    "postText": "Hi! I am a Danish student who will be joining BU next semester and I have a couple of questions I haven\u2019t been able to get answered by the exchange coordinator, Sage. The problem really isn\u2019t that she wasn\u2019t able to answer, more that I wrote her 6 times until I got a generic reply that did not solve anything. But as stated in all the information emails send to us, she is very busy.. So that\u2019s why I thought you could help!\n\n1. I am 28/29 the next semester and will be taking courses from 400-600, I am on my second year of my masters. I am a bit afraid of being much older than my classmates but how does it work over there, does it even matter?\n2. Same question with the age but with housing. They say you will be put in undergrad housing - but as I understand it this will mean I have to share with somebody 10 years younger than me? That\u2019s not optimal for any of us I think..\n3. The extracurricular classes such as ballet, swim, tennis etc. will you be able to sign up for those in the same period as you can swap and change you other classes?\n\nI hope you can help me, I\u2019m sorry I know I worry a lot..I would just like to know before I move halfway across the globe \ud83d\ude2c\n\nTLDR: help me",

            "comment": "1. I'm not sure what classes you'll be taking, and it depends on the major, but there were definitely older students in a lot of my classes (particularly 400-600 level classes, because those generally had a lot of graduate students). I never thought it was strange for there to be a wide range of ages in the class.\n2. If you're going to be put in undergrad housing, there is a chance that you'll be with an 18 year old freshman. My understanding of exchange students is that they're placed in whatever is open, but you can always try contacting BU Housing directly to explain the situation. There might be something they can do. If you do get put in a housing situation that you don't like, you can always try to transfer to different housing on campus. \n3. Yes, you can sign up for the PDP (extracurricular) classes during the beginning of the semester. I'm not 100% sure when the deadline is to register for the PDP classes, but it's after the semester begins.\n\nI hope that you enjoy your semester in Boston! Feel free to reach out if you have more questions about life at BU/in Boston.",

There are single apartments available for grad students. https://www.bu.edu/housing/graduate-housing/\n\n3. Yes!\n\nWelcome to Boston!",

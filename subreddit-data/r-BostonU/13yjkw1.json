But I found this online: https://www.bu.edu/undergradorientation/how-to-join/accommodations/ \n\nOn this page, it says bedding is provided. But I would still bring a sleeping bag since the mattresses are very uncomfortable, especially when it\u2019s hot outside. The sweat+plastic mattress=not good.",

Although representative of where you\u2019ll live freshman/sophomore year, it was quite miserable. \n\nLike most dorms, no AC. But all there is to beat the heat are these tiny desk fans. The windows only open inward 45 degrees too so no luck there.\n\nJust hope it\u2019s mild weather.",

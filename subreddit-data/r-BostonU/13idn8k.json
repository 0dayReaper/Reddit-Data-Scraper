    "postText": "Hello! \nMy senior is moving back home to Tx and may have some items he needs to get rid of.  He worked hard and got a scholarship and I\u2019m a single mom who helped him with everything else so I know how hard it is, when you don\u2019t have a lot.  If you are in need like my son, message me and I can send you a list of things he is not going to be able to take come and we can talk.  I would love to give them to just anyone but seeing as I am sure there are other students in his same predicament I really want to help out those kids.  I am not sure what he is going to have to leave but I can possibly provide a list , later this week",

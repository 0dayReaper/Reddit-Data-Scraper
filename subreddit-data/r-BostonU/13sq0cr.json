Law school building is open during the day and they probably won't kick you out but it'll get busy soon with orientation and other programs. There are a couple of cafes in Coolidge Corner and Allston that stay open while it's hottest out (Temptations, Pavement). You might have some luck at cafes around Back Bay, just check hours on Google maps.",

    "postText": "There\u2019s a homeless man on Harvard Ave that I\u2019m sure a lot of you who live off campus are familiar with. He definitely suffers from some issues and sometimes yells to himself and it can be startling but I have never ever ever seen this man be aggressive or even really talk to people. He minds his own and is completely harmless. This is probably the third time I\u2019ve seen a group of teenage boys antagonizing this man by laughing and pointing at him and mimicking the way he paces up and down Harvard Ave, then running away mockingly when he moves towards them. I\u2019m so sick of it. I know he sees them and it just makes me so sad because in what world do you think that\u2019s okay. I wanna say something but I\u2019m a girl and often feel pressure to not get involved in situations involving groups of teenage boys. Idk it just makes me mad. If anyone has advice on something I can say without making these boys get aggressive let me know",

            "comment": "If it is Eugene you are talking about (I just saw him at 711 so I assume it is), then rest assure the last thing the man does is \"mind his business\" . Just now he was making a fuss at 711 and yelling at the cashier (the nice guy who's always there), and it looked like it could get messy. He eventually ran away (I think with some goods bc one of the cashiers went after him, but I couldn't care less for 711's loss of revenue so no judgement for that), and I saw him standing at the 66 stop when walking back to my apartment after. But it is definitely not the first time he does something like that. This one time last semester I hopped on the T at Harvard Ave on my way to campus, and he got in as well with a group of people. It was one of the cars with accessible entrances, so the seats were parallel to the car's length and ppl sat facing the inside of the car. At first Eugene is quiet, but as the T starts moving the starts talking (don't ask me what) with this girl sitting on one of those seats, who was wearing her headphones and probably in her 20s. She ignores him, as I'm sure many women are used to doing when random guys start insistingly talking with them, but he persists and at some point is so in her space that his head hung above hers and his knee stood between her legs. The girl got out right on Packards Corner, and I'm pretty sure it wasn't her stop since she had just got on the car at Harvard. On the same note of harassing young women, another encounter I had with him was when my friend and I were walking to Star one night and spotted him talking to a girl at the bus stop in front of that gym next to the UPS store. We decided to wait at the bus stop too, as google said the bus was more than 10 minutes away. We get to the stop, and after hearing their conversation (more like a monologue about secret cities from his side accompanied by a few awkward nods from hers) we casually intervene with some excuse about the bus taking too long, and fake a conversation with her that we were calling an uber and she should come with us. Thankfully she agreed, and after some complaints from Eugene and a fair amount of saliva escaping his lips we managed to get away and actually call an uber. She tells us she is an exchange student from Chile at BC for that semester, and that her phone battery had died, so she didn't even know when the bus was coming, and that he had showed up and held her verbally captive. Keep in mind, this occurred a month after I had first met Eugene, when we were moving into our apartment and he kept trying to convince my roommates and I to not take shifts watching the Uhaul as the others moved stuff in because Allston was \"a safe area\". He proceeded to vomit on the sidewalk. I could keep on going: yelling at people eating at Five Guys, smashing glass bottles in front of people as they walk or try to cross the street, etc. Obviously I'm not saying all this to defend those kids that were making fun of him, or to say he deserves it, but I'm trying to make a point that the guy is clearly not harmless. It is clearly pathetic to mock a person in a situation like his, whatever it may be, because the guy clearly has some issues that are out of his control, but I think it should not be a priority concern when it comes to Eugene. On the contrary, I think he is a risk to others, as you never know what he might do. So just be careful in believing he really just minds his own and is harmless, as you might learn otherwise if you approach him or he approaches you. Also, I'm not even sure he is homeless, as I have never seen him asking for money, which many homeless people tend to do at Harvard Ave since it's so busy, and he is often wearing different clothes. Anyway, sorry for the long expos\u00e9 on Eugene, but I wanted to make it clear that he is less harmless than he is a harasser, apparently especially when it comes to women. I think those kids should go get screwed as they are clearly not helping his or anyone's situation, and making fun of someone like this is just unfunny and cruel, so I absolutely see where you are coming from. That said everyone should be careful when interacting with him, whether intentionally or not.",

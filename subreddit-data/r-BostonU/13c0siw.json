I'm going to be seeing Taylor Swift on Saturday May 20th, and I a missed the MBTA special train tickets. I was wondering if anyone else was going here and would be willing to share an Uber to just get there or just get back or had room in their car for either of those scenarios? I would be eternally grateful :)",

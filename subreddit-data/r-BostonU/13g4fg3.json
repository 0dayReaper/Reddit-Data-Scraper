            "comment": "currently finishing my gap year and starting med school in the fall. i personally have found my gap year to be extremely beneficial and i wished i had taken another one. i\u2019ve gotten work experience but most importantly i feel like i have grown significantly as a person. i\u2019ve had a lot more time to reflect on who i am as a person and what i want for myself down the road. and i feel like i\u2019ve only been able to do this because i was away from the stress of school/studying. i\u2019ve had time to pursue my hobbies and meet wonderful new people and especially in my 20s it\u2019s really important because once you start med school you will be busy. not that you won\u2019t have any free time but this is kinda one of my last opportunities to really explore and have some fun. i still do research as my full time job so i\u2019ve been able to have fun and do something productive during my gap year as well. of course not everyone will have the same positive experience i have had with a gap year and don\u2019t feel they need one and that\u2019s totally ok too! this is just my personal experience. i could keep going into this so feel free to dm me if you want to discuss more!\n\nedit: also wanted to address your mcat concerns. only take the mcat when you are ready. you don\u2019t want to risk having an ok mcat just to start med school a year earlier when it\u2019s probably better to take your time studying to get a stellar score and start maybe a little after you had planned. some people are great self learners and i\u2019ve had many friends take the mcat before taking all their prereqs too and it\u2019s great that it worked for them but if medicine is what you truly want to do, then don\u2019t feel like you need to rush into it. it will always be there",

            "comment": "took two gap years- initially was planning to matriculate straight from undergrad but COVID prevented me from taking my MCAT and getting the score back before applying, and I didn't want to risk having to apply bad score. I am so glad I took two years- I bumped my MCAT from a 516 to 524 with the extra time to study (took it after studying 3 mo straight in the fall of my senior year), and I was able to apply with better letters of rec and way more experience. I was accepted into a couple really good schools with full ride/close to full ride scholarships. (including this info in case you would like to use these as pointers for your parents lol).\n\nI got a great research position and have been able to work on really relevant projects/topics that I hope to continue with in medical school. As the other commenter mentioned, I also grew and matured a lot as a person. I would 100% say if you don't think you are ready, it is worth taking a year (or two, three, etc) and solidifying why you want to pursue medicine and building our your resume. You can also save up money and have a nice little cushion- it won't do much to pay for school, but it can take some of the sting out. \n\nTaking more time is becoming more common, too- the average age of many classes has increased one or two years, so your parents' concerns that you are not \"doing what everyone else is doing\" may be a bit misplaced.",

            "comment": "Just tell her that gap years are becoming so common that med schools will sometimes actually prefer those who took gap years because theyre considered more mature and experienced due to age. Med schools get more worried about burnout and unprofessionalism with younger students now. I attend conferences for pre meds and have literally had countless medical schools say this to my face.",

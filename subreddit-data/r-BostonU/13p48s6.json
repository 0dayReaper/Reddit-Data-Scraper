I\u2019m moving back home to my parents with zero job prospects and although I\u2019m really grateful I have a support system like my family I just feel a sense of sadness\u2026like college is really over and it kinda just hit me. How do you deal with this post college depression? Does it eventually get better once you find a job and start your career? Feeling really anxious about the future right now :/",

I spent the summer being the most depressed I have ever been trying to battle these thoughts if what I had to achieve and what my life was SUPPOSED to look like after college. The big thing to keep in mind is that there is NO PLAN! THERE IS NO AGENDA!!!! \nAs soon as I accepted that I started applying to things I've always wanted to experience and now I live in Australia and work on a boat. \nWork at Game Stop, learn to kayak, start a YouTube channel dedicated to hamsters. Do not listen to what other people are doing. There is no right way to live.",

But as time went on and I got settled into my new living situation and surrounded myself with people (mix of hometown &amp; BU friends/acquaintances), I slowly adjusted to this next chapter of my life. It was uncomfortable, but with my support system of family and friends, I just learned to accept that this part of growing up in my 20s.\n\nThere\u2019s really no agenda to how you choose to live your life. Take a breather, you just graduated! \u25e1\u0308",

I moved home, I missed all of my college friends who mostly lived in NYC and Boston (I was in Pennsylvania), and all in all just felt lost and depressed. Like everyone else is saying, go figure out what you want to do and have fun. I ended up loving that year after college. I ended up applying to graduate school and then going to medical school. Life works out. One of the most important things I learned from that year off was how much weight your BU degree holds. It will help you for the rest of your life in whatever field you decide to pursue. College is over, a little mourning is more than warranted, but you have a whole life ahead of you to figure out what you want to do, and now you\u2019ve got a powerful piece of paper to help you achieve that.",

Try your best to stay in your state where your friends and family are by getting remote work. Situational depression usually goes away if you can spend the money you earn. Become extraordinary enough the work is not stressful to you. Hope you didn\u2019t pick something like accounting or law or dentistry. \n\nWhenever you see the new wave of college graduated YouTubers being depressed and quitting their job, it\u2019s usually because they\u2019re living ALONE in a HCOL city for their stressful white collar jobs.",

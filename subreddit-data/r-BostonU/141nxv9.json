    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI'm an incoming transfer student(sophomore) and thankfully, I received enough financial aid + scholarships to pay approximately 5k a year. However, I do have questions that will decide if I will end up at BU or not as I have been waitlisted by Vandy with the possibility of being accepted.\n\n\\-Will off-campus housing require me to pay more than what I got for my financial aid package?(if possible, can someone briefly walk me through the process?)\n\n\\-As an IR major, is this department recognized as prestigious?(in terms of getting employed/internships/networking)\n\n\\-I heard from someone that if you wait off the on-campus housing, there are occasions where BU even grants transfer students \"hotel rooms\"; can anyone confirm this?\n\nThanks for any advice!",

            "comment": "I think that the IR major is pretty good, BU really doubled down on putting in money after it became Pardee a few years ago as opposed to just another dept within CAS. I think that BU may really try to advertise that AOC was an IR major at BU so it's clear that graduates are out in the real world doing cool stuff with their degrees.\n\nYou are lucky in the sense that Boston is the capital of MA so you can apply around to various positions in the city. Myself, I interned for the Gov during my junior year.",

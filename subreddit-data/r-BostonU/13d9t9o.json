    "postText": "Hi! Im an incoming freshman and I was wondering if anyone has recommendations for dining plans? I\u2019m leaning towards all access + so I get more points to spend outside of dining halls (im not the most picky eater but I get pretty sensitive to the food I eat.) Is the weekly 10+ a bad option?? Thanks!",

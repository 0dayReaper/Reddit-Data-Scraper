    "postText": "I'm an incoming class of 2026 transfer students and I had to take a semester off during my first year. I'm planning on either doing an Economics Major and Political Science Minor or an Economics BA/MA but I'm worried about graduating on time with my class because I don't want to miss the graduation ceremony. I wouldn't have a problem missing it if it wasn't such a big accomplishment in my family (I'm a first-generation student). Because I lost a semester's worth of classes I'll have to overload during all my semesters at BU to graduate on time and I don't wanna clump all of my hardest classes together but I also don't wanna miss the ceremony. Could you guys tell me if I would still be able to get a graduation ceremony if I graduate a semester or a year later?",

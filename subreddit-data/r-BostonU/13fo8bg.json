His system for the homework is that you turn in a draft of the problem set, which he gives an initial grade and returns to you, and then you can revise it and turn it in to get any lost points back.\n\nThe class itself starts pretty easy if you've encountered any logic and proof-writing in other courses. It definitely ramps up in difficulty - mostly in writing the proofs, but I found them to be enjoyable puzzles and it's a very different kind of math to the typical calc/linear algebra sequence. It's entirely theoretical and proof-based - there are no calculations at all.",

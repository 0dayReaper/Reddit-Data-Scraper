    "postText": "I'm a rising junior, just switched majors/schools into COM. I want to study abroad in the Spring, but am taking CM201 this fall semester, and won't be able to do CM331 until after abroad. Has anyone done this before/know if it is possible to do? It says 331 is a requirement for abroad, but I can imagine other people have been in this situation before too...",

I don't know whether or not it was because that was my final full-time semester, but as long as I was registered to take CM201 over the summer, it was allowed. These things happen, and they're not as rigid as they claim to be. \n\n As a rising junior, I'm fairly certain that as long as you talk it through with your advisor and assure them that CM331 is slated for your schedule after abroad, it'll be okay. Just reach out and ask them.",

For instance, if you got a 4 or 5 on AP Microeconomics then you\u2019d get credit for CAS EC 101 and a social inquiry 1 hub unit. If you had taken EC 101 at BU you would have gotten social inquiry 1, ethical reasoning, and critical thinking.\n\nJust use the link assassingiantshark sent and you\u2019ll be fine though. :)",

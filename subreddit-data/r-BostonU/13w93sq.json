(ik BU is higher ranked school but i trust personal student experiences a bit more than rankings)\n\nany insight or advice would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "I think this is BU easily. Obviously everybody comes from different economic backgrounds and I don't know how meaningful $5k a year would be to you, but that could easily be covered by internships and your full time jobs. The delta is so small, that to me personally BU seems to be the obvious answer. Not to mention that in general, BU would make it easier for you to get an internship and I imagine there are some companies that would probably recruit at BU but not UMass Boston. I'm not saying BU is a target school for recruiting in business, but UMass Boston is less so a target than BU.\n\nIDK how it is at UMass Boston, so you'd have to go to their subreddit or speak to students there. But at BU, you could definitely join a plethora of business clubs - whether it's finance, consulting, business fraternities. Go with BU and don't look back.",

It\u2019s also in a terrible location disconnected from the rest of the city, for 5k more a year it\u2019s 110% worth it to go to BU. I understand u not wanting to look purely at rankings when making ur decision but there is some merit in them\u2026 just the quality of students / ur peers is going to be a lot different (locals at Umass or people from across the globe at BU)",

I know for me when choosing schools umass boston looked cheap but came out to be more expensive with housing that is practically nonexistent. UMB is a commuter school for mostly locals and they have completely different experiences. I\u2019m from the area and have friends that go to both and both say that BU was a better experience",

It's super easy to switch majors here, I was actually admitted to Questrom (business school) and switched to econ and you'd have no problem doing the other way. I know people like to make fun of UMass Boston on this sub, but I have no real knowledge of that school but idk I'd think 10k a year for BU is a great choice.",

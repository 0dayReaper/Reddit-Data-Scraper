    "postText": "TL;DR: I\u2019m a fucking dumbass and put the cotton swab in my mouth instead of my nose. Had to do a retest. \n\n\nI woke up this morning, heard the birds chirping, the hustle and bustle of Boston as it whirred to life. I said to myself, \u201cAh, what a beautiful morning to have a COVID test\u201d, as I promptly hit the snooze button on my 8am alarm. \n\nOr so I thought. \n\nIt turns out a critical error in the decision to hit snooze had occurred. I had hit the OFF button. Next, I awoke with a start. Frantically running around my apartment as I realized I had awoken at 8:58, while still having an appointment at 9:10. I brushed all 32 of my teeth individually, washed my haggard face, and threw on my best BU Apparel\u2122\ufe0f as I prayed to President Brown for good luck on the ensuing journey. \n\nAfter running like I stole something at the risk of having my hand cut off, I finally arrived. As the sweat caressed my brow, I looked up: The Agganis Stadium. It was there, I was there. I strolled through the doors confident in my ability to smash viral tests like my name was Jill Valentine, but alas I had overestimated my COVID dodging abilities. As I approached the counter, the woman asked for my QR code, one that I showed her while simultaneously spinning my phone on my finger. \n\nI approached the counter, and received a cotton swab. As I was given instructions on how to proceed, I began to dissociate. My thoughts raced, my heart pounded. And I l did the only thing that seemed natural to me. I put the fucking cotton swap into my mouth instead of my nose. Everyone within a 10 mile radius looked at me with pure abhorrence. They wondered how someone could commit such an atrocity. The worker leaned forward with the power of 100 \u2018BOI \ud83d\udc4b\u2019s and said, \u201cIn your nose, honey\u201d.\n\nI had been defeated. Bested by a cotton swab. I hung my head in shame as I probed my nostrils for any invaders. The walk of shame back to my dorm was one of reflection, introspection, and internal screaming alike. I am now gazing upon the vast expanse of Allston as I write this entry, and I implore you, don\u2019t be a fucking dumbass like me.",

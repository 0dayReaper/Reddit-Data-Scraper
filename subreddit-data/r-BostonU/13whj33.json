As a student body we definitely made it more difficult for him to get money from a possible mark. \nBut I will also say that was a shit graduation speech, the protests were one of the few things keeping me awake during it. He really should\u2019ve paid his writers for a better graduation speech",

Still, it being awkward seems like a moderate inconvenience when placed next to what the WGA is trying to do, which is make sure it\u2019s members can make a living. Brown is just acting like an aggrieved little child who seems to think that he and his buddies are above criticism.\n\nThere is also the aspect that a lot of schools are just spending more and more resources to cozy up to the rich and powerful for donations instead of creating research and teaching infrastructure. This whole episode with the speech and screed letter just seems to me to be another example of this problem in our society.",

This is not \"cancel culture.\" It is laughable to think that the CEO of a major media corporation is being silenced by some undergrads. He has so many resources to make his voice heard: protestors were objecting to him being elevated by the university during the writers' strike.\n\nAnd protests *need* to be disruptive. That's why they are protests! To say that you respect protests but then turn around and say we need to uphold decorum is just a contradiction.\n\nLabeling this \"cancel culture\" also feels like a bat-signal to The Worst People^(TM) to characterize the students as \"triggered liberal snowflakes who can't handle opposing views\". This article just feels like throwing the student body under the bus in order to appease Zaslav. Just a bad bad bad response.",

I get you have issues with the person speaking, but if it was an event you were looking forward to attending (e.g. a speech by your favorite musician) and someone was disturbing the peace you'd be pissed as hell and be wondering why are they not being escorted out. This is an event that an institution has set up as a service that a lot of people are looking forward to attending and I don't see how it's cool for some people to ruin it for everyone by being loud and making it their personal political protest no matter how shitty the speaker may be. Not saying that I agree with BU's speaker choice but I don't get why this has to be so political",

The rest of the ceremony was perfectly tame and encountered no disruptions, and I don't really think it's comparable to someone's favorite musician. This was a stand against the complete and total apathy of the institution that students were told respected them and held their interests in high regard. You don't have to like it, that's hardly the point, but BU was fully aware that this was a risk when they brought Zaslav aboard.\n\nThese things don't exist in a vacuum -- Zaslav was uplifted by the university to \"welcome\" students into an industry that he is personally responsible for making unhabitable, quite literally at the fever pitch of a historical Union strike. There were hundreds of picketers outside of the event, advocating for workers rights that HEAVILY pertain to the future livelihoods of many, many graduates, but Zaslav stuck his head in the sand and couldn't even be bothered to acknowledge the landscape. It has to be \"political\" -- if that's the word you want to use -- because he is a representative of all the industry Big Bads that these students will come to face, and if you want to make a distinctive impact for Union efforts, you're going to have to be a bit disruptive.\n\nThere's nothing illegal about students making concerted and combined efforts to condemn the speaker when the sentiments are pro-labor and semi historical. Annoying, sure, that's the point, but certainly not illegal.",

How many of them can name even 1 writer for WB? I have no love loss for Hollywood elite ( if that is what he is).

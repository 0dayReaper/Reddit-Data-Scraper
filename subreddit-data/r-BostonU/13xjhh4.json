I was thinking of double majoring with econ or french, but probably econ because what other practical things can I do with a french degree besides translating? The only problem is that I'm a bit challenged when it comes to econ but I'm willing to push myself. Idk, any advice?",

You can still take French classes because it'll just count towards your language requirement for CAS so even if you don't end up doing the French major, it still helps.",

I'm aiming at moving onto or nearish to the campus and am looking to get in touch with others in the same spot. If there's a better way to do that, I'd really appreciate any info, and if you're interested, feel free to reach out. I'm a 22 year old guy for anyone keeping score.",

It\u2019s been my experience that the majority of users of this sun are (naturally) undergrads and if you\u2019re looking for other law students this probably isn\u2019t the place to find them congregating.",

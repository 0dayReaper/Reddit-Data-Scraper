You can support the protest, and that's great, but that doesn't mean you have to miss your graduation and that doesn't mean you're a bastard for going to it. It's your call obviously.\n\nLots of union workers, who stand in solidarity with the WGA, still have to cross the picket line (often by contractual obligation). Some movies and TV shows were already written and were filming by the time the strike started and some of these are finishing filming without their writers. In these cases, union workers, including actors, are still obligated to do their work, with the scripts in the state they were in when the strike started. If someone starts covering a writer's duties on a union show, that's messed up. But otherwise, we can film/perform/work with what is already written.\n\nOn the other side, if a company/producer (of a union project) asks someone to cover a writer's duties during the strike, then that person would be a scab and that's not cool.",

It\u2019s more like the studio hires a 4 writers at the same time, pieces together a script from the scraps they personally believe work, and shit out a movie. That\u2019s why 90% of major studio releases are fucking terrible. \n\nSeems like you don\u2019t care about art OR workers, which is super fucking based actually. Good shit, v cool",

    "postText": "Hello, I am an incoming freshman CS major and was wondering if it is feasible to redeem credits for the Higher Level courses I took in the IB programme.\n\nI will probably get a 6 or a 7 on the IB HL Computer Science exam, so I will be able to redeem credits for those CS 111 and CS 112. However, is it a good idea? I have a solid grasp of everything in the [CS 111 syllabus](https://www.cs.bu.edu/courses/cs111/files/cs111_syllabus_23spring.pdf) other than the last few lecture topics (inheritance, finite-state machines, algorithm efficiency and problem \"hardness\"). As for CS 112, I don't know any Java but I do have a decent understanding of topics like recursion, sorting algorithms and some abstract data types. Right now I am considering skipping CS 111 and heading straight into CS 112.\n\nI also took HL Math Analysis &amp; Approaches, and will probably pass with a 5 or 6. Therefore I will most likely be able to redeem credits for MA 123 and MA 124. I already know the vast majority of MA 123's content. I have not reached the last few topics taught in MA 124. I am confident in redeeming credits for MA 123. The only thing stopping me from redeeming credits for MA 124 is not knowing whether the knowledge I get from that course is heavily relied upon in the rest of the CS major curriculum. Will skipping these two courses negatively impact the rest of my studies in CS?",

            "comment": "I was in a similar situation as you. I decided to retake Cs111 and CS112 because we didn't do Python or Java in IB. I know that the majority of people skip it. The topics you mentioned are important but can be self-taught. However, I don't think they are extensively tested in courses after 111 and 112, so it shouldn't be an issue. As a CS major you should be fine without retaking MA 124. I did skip both and I haven't faced an issue yet.",

CS 112's topics seem a lot more advanced and I think it could prove useful to have another more serious look at them. As for math, which math courses are mandatory or recommended to take as a CS major?",

As someone with no CS experience I still found 111 super easy but relatively informative. 112 I learned a lot but struggled with the actual coding as I had very little experience at that point.",

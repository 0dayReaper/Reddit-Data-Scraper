I\u2019m unsure wether my insurance will be able to qualify for SHIP waiving because I can only use it in NY. It does comply with BU checklist except for point 3 that says that it needs to be of open network in Boston. I was able to waive my insurance at my last college that was in the Midwest but I\u2019m not sure if that would be the case at BU and I\u2019m really worried about it since I cannot afford to pay $3280 in one semester for the insurance. What do you guys think I should do?",

            "comment": "I came into Higher Ed at BU after nearly 2 decades in retail banking, so mine might be an extreme example, but my work-life balance at BU is absolutely delightful. I love my job because of this very reason.  I feel like I can leave my work at the office every day and on the weekends. I feel like my senior management actually gives a sh\\*t about my well-being and job satisfaction. In return, I feel good about putting energy into my work, doing a good job, being accountable and helping my coworkers, when I can. It's nice to be treated like something other than a replaceable part in the vast machine.  People complain that the financial benefits  (salary) arent as comparable as in the \"real world.\" There is some truth to this, but the so called \"soft\" benefits go a LONG way to making my job satisfaction higher than it ever was in banking. I've been in my current role at BU longer than I was ever was in a single job during my corporate years. in the past, I could expect to be looking for a new gig every 2-3 years.  I've been in my current role for almost 8 years and couldn't be happier.  \nEdit: I'm now realizing you probably meant how is the work/life balance related to COURSEWORK (duh).  Sorry.  As you can probably tell, I'm a happy BU employee.",

            "comment": "Really depends on what you choose to do both in terms of classes and your other activities. Classes are definitely manageable, and like some other people said here, Core will be a bit intense but if you\u2019re not doing much alongside it you\u2019ll be fine (a lot of people will really talk up how hard it is but it\u2019s actually not that bad). Extracurriculars, depending on which and how many you do, can really eat up your time or can be really chill. There are some people who also chose to intern during the semester, so that\u2019s another variable that could add to someone\u2019s workload. But overall, work life balance is fine at BU and is mainly determined by how you decide to live out your time here. Final note I\u2019d add though is that I came from an intense high school, so my perspective of BU is based off that experience. Feel free to reach out with any questions!",

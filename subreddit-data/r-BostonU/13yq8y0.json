I took the course this past semester and want to LA in the fall.\n\nDoes anyone know people that didn't get it or have any advice about the application?\n\nAll thoughts appreciated",

I worked hard on the application because I figured the chem department doesn\u2019t think as highly of the off-sequence general chemistry. They didn\u2019t reach out to my reference at all. \n\nI think the most important thing to relay on your app is the experiences you had with your LAs in chemistry and how they contributed to your success. Share how much you enjoy working with others and possibly some anecdotes from when you helped your fellow classmates learn. They already know you\u2019re good at chem, they want to see you\u2019re a good teacher and a kind person.",

    "postText": "Basically tittle: \nContext I am in SM275 and I know it\u2019s a tough class to do well in but I\u2019ve been through some shit with this professor with accusations on cheating that were dropped. This prof has been heading my work and I think there are clear biases. I do the work to the T of the rubric and get lower than people who don\u2019t follow the assignment. Got my last assignment and thought I deserved better then my average grade and I got a B. Can I do something to get my work graded by a different professor. It feels unfair to be stuck with a prof who holds biases from false accusations.\n\nedit: i can\u2019t really prove any biases since they\u2019re not explicit or recorded but i have the feeling of unsafeness",

Maybe if you are familiar with the other profs you can go to their office hours to have them check instead? Although it is pretty late in the semester at this point but worth a shot",

Always email the college Dean about any sort of suspicions lol I doubt they\u2019ll \u201cget annihilated\u201d if they have reasonable suspicion. Also see my comment on how I think if the B is an overall grade, they should let it be. But if they have solid proof of bias then they need to email the Dean lol so you\u2019re being really dumb by saying not to do that",

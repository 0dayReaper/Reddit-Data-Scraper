    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI'm trying to declare a data science minor through my major school: ie questrom. I went on this link however it also asks me what I'm concentrating in. I'm not sure as of now and just want to declare the minor. How do I get around this? Would you suggest just putting a random concentration and changing it later on or declaring the minor later? fyi I am a rising junior, so I would have to decide soon.",

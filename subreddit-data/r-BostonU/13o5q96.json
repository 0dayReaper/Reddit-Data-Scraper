Vaping and blowing it in peoples faces, talking the entire time, and constantly making fun of the degree candidates who worked their entire lives for this achievement?? Y\u2019all are classless and I truly hope you spent 80K+ to end up working at McDonalds. No pickles on my burger please \u2764\ufe0f",

Believe it or not: there is a world outside of your privileged 80k+ private university where people are trying to make a living.\n\nBU could have done better by its students by not having Zaslav as its speaker, as controversy will follow him during this strike no matter what, and by inviting him they invited said controversy to commencement. If you are upset at anyone, be upset at BU admin and their disappointing choices!",

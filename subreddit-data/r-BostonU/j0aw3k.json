    "postText": "Please don\u2019t take this down because I\u2019m not trying to make this political (because it isnt) but I support planned parenthood, and unfortunately there are often times protestors outside of the PP on comm ave. I know it can be scary walking into the building alone (especially if you are a young adult woman) when there are protestors outside, so I am willing to walk you to and from your appointment, given I am free at the time. You don\u2019t need to tell me why you have an appointment (unless you want) and we can never speak again if that\u2019s your cup of tea. I don\u2019t judge anyone for using their services, and I know for low income students it is often the only option. I have been there myself and am thankful that they did not charge me the full cost because I was a student and didn\u2019t have a job. **If you are pro-life, you do you, but don\u2019t bother commenting on this post because I am not going to change my position. I have done plenty of research on the topic of abortion and my views are what they are.**\n\nEdit: I love that people are also offering to help and I am currently in contact with someone from stugov to *maybe* turn this into an actual program. I\u2019ll try to keep everyone posted :-)\n\nEdit 2: this planned parenthood is a part of the program that PP has that has escorts and you can volunteer through their website! I am trying to figure out how to do that now and will do a new post with more info!!!",

They've been making me angrier and angrier lately; the other day I couldn't resist telling a lady she was an absolute goddamn hypocrite for wearing a \"defend life\" sign while not wearing a goddamn mask.\n\nWhen I got my IUD, it was absolutely fucking terrible. I could barely walk after, and had to stay at that Planned Parenthood (the very same one you're offering this service for) for hours before they felt safe letting me go. As I left the clinic, feeling tired and sad and emotionally exhausted, I was accosted by a crowd of protesters. One of them, a tiny older woman, followed me down the street for several blocks as I hobbled as fast as I could away. The entire time she was yelling at me in a language I didnt understand and brandishing a pamphlet with the large words \"living in sin\" and \"eternal damnation\" emblazoned on the front. It was a terrible, scary experience, and I WASN'T EVEN GETTING A GODDAMN ABORTION. I was doing something that was incredibly helpful to my life and my health, a decision that I made with a doctor's help. I can't even imagine how I would have fared had I been actually doing that heavy, serious thing and then had to walk out to that crowd.\n\nLong story short, fuck those people. And thank you, OP, for supporting people; if you'd been around at that time, I probably would have asked for your help.",

They'll give you a vest/uniform so you're instantly identifiable as a friend to people coming for services, and they'll schedule you. It's nice to offer on here, but working directly with PP is where you'll be able to help the most.",

But one day after I moved in down the street I asked him what his favorite part of living there was.  He wasn't sure but he was adamant that it wasn't being woken up to the sound of praying outside his window every Sunday morning...  Apparently people protesting planned Parenthood pray quite loudly using a bullhorn some mornings.",

I would be there for emotional support and to tell the protests to fuck off if the woman I am accompanying doesn\u2019t feel comfortable to do so herself. Additionally, after an abortion, iud implantation, or other procedure, a woman would be very weak and can sometimes barely walk. The protesters take advantage of this and will follow them blocks yelling at them. If the protestors see someone walking with the woman they are less likely to do this. And I always carry pepper spray on me as a woman living in the city and would use it only in self defense",

    "postText": "Hi, Ad/graphic design students!! My prof in com 417 showed some of yall's portfolios on Squarespace and I've also been looking at some on LinkedIn... I really want to make one like that. I want to be a strategist or an AE but i am taking portfolio development next semester and would love a creative/strategy portfolio to show well-roundedness. My concern however is that I'm not sure if I'll be able to navigate Squarespace to make it look professional. Does anyone have experience with making a port on SS and can testify to this? I also was wondering how much u guys pay a month to use it/if its worth it/if BU has some type of discount?? any tips at all are appreciated. thanks!!",

            "comment": "Hi, so the thing is you'll inevitably have to pay for a portfolio website so I suggest you pay for Squarespace. I know a lot of portfolio websites have offers for students so check that out before you choose which website you want to go with.\n\nSquarespace is fairly easy to navigate and has templates/ sections you can use when showcasing your work. It's a matter of trial and error to see what you like/ what you think looks professional. If it's too hard, you can always ask one of your professors to help you with it.",

For individuals of Latin American descent, it's imperative to use the term Latinx instead of Latino or Latina. The terms Latino and Latina are inherently gendered and do not acknowledge the wide range of gender identities present within the Latin American community.\n\nWe, as a Latinx community, prefer the use of Latinx as it acknowledges and respects our diverse gender identities. It is crucial to prioritize the voices of marginalized communities, and using gender-neutral language is just one of the many ways in which we can work towards a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\nI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Figure out what you are interested in and have aptitude for - and pursue it - without destroying your sanity and finances.      I've had Princeton grads come out an ask me \"How a UMass gets to work here given how selective the firm is about schools.\"   We had an MIT grad that we had to terminate claim that I should have gone before him.   These kids are mislead into believing that a high GPA or a particular school is a guarantor of success later in life.   If you think your low GPA is \"Unfair\" despite all the \"work\" devote to your classes, then things are going to get very rough for you very soon. LOL!",

Keep in mind, that senior compensation salaries are pretty much in this 200-250K range.  The real wealth is not from W-2 Income, but ISOs and RSUs,  and Annual and Quarterly performance bonuses. \n\nA young person in Tech will receive a very high salary simply due to scarcity and the need to retain talent. However, younger tech people are more vulnerable to layoffs once firms experience a revenue or financing pivot.  My advice to you is to live like the other 22 years olds out there - get some roommates,  own a cheap used car,  dump the expensive girlfriend - and Pack as Much of that $$$ you are making into Tax Efficient investments and maybe even create a Living Trust so that the wealth you build is exempt from future divorces or lawsuits.\n\nBoomer Out.",

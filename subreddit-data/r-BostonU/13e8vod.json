    "postText": "I got accepted as a transfer and just got my package after 2 weeks of waiting. I have an EFC of 0 and I only got 24k in aid. Boston University claims to meet 100% need based. I am extremely confused and saddened by this and I submitted my information for appeal but I have seen people with an EFC of 0 as a transfer get over 82k in need. Can anyone help to give advice?",

Most people actually get happy when they see a beginner because it's awesome to see someone starting a journey toward bettering themselves! Everyone is there to improve themselves and focus on themselves. Just full send it you got it.\n\nAlso I found that YouTube videos helped me feel good that I was doing exercises correctly so you can try that!",

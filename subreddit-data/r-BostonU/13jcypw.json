I would get an air if the money is a concern and a regular mbp if it makes sense for you. \n\nI use a windows for work rn and my lead and I are on a crusade to switch over\n\nI got a mac for college and I'm over 2 years out at this point and I still use it everyday (I even game on it sometimes\ud83d\ude2e)",

I've only needed to use virutalBox in my upper level classes (500+) so hopefully by the time you reach those classes there will be a good virtualization solution for ARM Macs. But other than that I'd go Mac all the way.",

Mac is also good sometimes cuz it feels more smooth when you use it but windows can be easier to deal with sometimes. But regardless, instead of worrying about brand, I\u2019d say look into how much ram or storage it gives you.",

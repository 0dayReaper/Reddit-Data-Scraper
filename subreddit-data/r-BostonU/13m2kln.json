For kilachand seminars I would recommend getting classes that fulfill hub units that are not easy to find out outside of ENG like Aesthetic Exploration, Historical Consciousness and some other ones. For gen Chem I would recommend Professor Abrams or Professor Chen. Professors for studio don\u2019t really matter as much bc the class is pretty easy\u2014i wouldn\u2019t take it in the morning tho bc it\u2019s a long class. I would recommend going straight into MA225 it\u2019ll free up a lot of space in your schedule which is nice because with KHC and BME there are a lot of courses (but if you want to study abroad sophomore year this may not be the best  option bc for the program u need to take MA226 aboard). For intro to programming it\u2019s one professor and is basically self taught",

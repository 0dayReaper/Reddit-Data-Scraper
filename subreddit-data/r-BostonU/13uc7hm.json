    "postText": " \n\nDear Boston University\n\nFrom a \u201823 Graduate\n\n**PREFACE**\n\nI am writing this after much reflection and I want it to be clear that this is not coming from a place of hate or a need to get back at anyone. This document is simply to share my side of things as a student.  \n\nI want to express how poorly I think BU does about mental health issues. This is by no means a personal attack against any professor or TA I\u2019ve encountered but rather what they\u2019ve been trained on and how they could possibly do better. Sorry, I mean how *you* could have done better. If you\u2019re reading this, it\u2019s being addressed to you. I hope you don\u2019t take this personally but rather use this to think about how you, as a professor, can help even one student out.   \nFor many of you, you won\u2019t even remember my name by next year. Whether or not I did well, I\u2019m just another student on a giant list of all the students you\u2019ve had and will have. I\u2019ll remember your name. To Professor H\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*, Professor C\\*\\*\\*\\* and M\\*\\*\\*, and Professor H\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*, thank you for being the only people at this school that even bothered to check in on me, even if it was over one simple zoom call or a brief OH meeting. \n\nThis letter is also not meant to be well-written but rather a slurry of thoughts that I just need to get out on paper. I hope any comments made about this are directed towards the meaning behind my words rather than how they\u2019re written. \n\n**CLASSES**\n\nThey say that your years at college are supposed to be some of the best years of your life. When I was a freshman at another institution, I thought that I\u2019d be making so many memories. I had wanted to attend Boston University because I believed that I\u2019d be able to grow so much more. I spent both semesters that year doing my absolute best\u2013 ending with a 3.6 GPA both semesters and getting accepted into my dream school. \n\nWhen COVID hit, it was incredibly hard going to a new and bigger school with no friends and with no idea about how much harder it would be in my classes. Everything was online so it was difficult trying to meet people. Online classes seemed like they\u2019d be a breeze but I ended up failing a class my first semester. It would be an understatement to say that I was shattered but after talking to people I had met that semester, I quickly realized that I wasn\u2019t alone. A lot of people I knew also failed a class, so I didn\u2019t let the negativity fester and told myself to just do better the following semester. \n\nIt ended up just being the beginning of a cycle. I\u2019d do well in the spring semester, then do worse in the fall. Knowing that my mother worked so hard to keep my head above the water financially and I was pouring it down the drain really took a toll on me. \n\n**BU STUDENT HEALTH SERVICES**\n\nDuring finals week my Fall semester last year, I had my first mental breakdown. I did what I should have done much earlier, and called whatever services BU had to offer. I will say that it didn\u2019t take too long to get me connected to someone and I set up a meeting to talk about next steps, scheduled the next day. This is kind of where things go downhill. I talked about what I was feeling and what I wanted to do about it (speak to a therapist) and I was given a list of possible therapists. I know the next reasonable step would be to reach out to these therapists and see where my insurance lines up blah blah blah but I think where BU failed me was to give me an immediate resource. I really needed someone then, and all they could offer me was a list of people I had to personally look into and reach out to. \n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t struggle mentally, I want you to know that even calling the BU mental health services was taxing enough already. To then sit down and research therapists in a period of mental crisis was not something I felt like doing. So\u2026I never reached out to anyone again after that. I blame myself for not doing anything, already. Please try to understand that it\u2019s hard to reach out to people sometimes. One thing I\u2019d have them change is to have someone call back and check in on me. If someone from BU had done that, it would have told me that they actually do care about their students. A simple call could have prevented me from thinking that the services BU offered were completely worthless. Sure, there are other things that need to be worked on and I wouldn\u2019t have thought that it\u2019s a perfect system, but literally anything to show that they care could help. Take some notes, BU. \n\n**FRIENDS**\n\nI wouldn\u2019t consider myself to be an extrovert but I managed to find a good group of friends. There were a few times where I think my overthinking got the best of me and I felt lonely. There were moments during my junior year when my overthinking got the best of me, leaving me feeling incredibly lonely.  I\u2019ll admit there were times I felt like inviting me was an obligation rather than the fact that they just wanted me to be there. \n\nThat feeling has gone away now, but it really sucked my junior year starting off that way and not being emotionally capable of just having that conversation with them to ease any doubts of dislike toward me. Senior year was much better and I was able to have those conversations with them if I felt like things were off. The worst part of my mental health issues was my relationships being sabotaged. I\u2019d distance myself if I felt like I was being distanced from to almost feel like I was the one who initiated it. After all, if it was my choice to be distant, I can\u2019t be sad about it, right?\n\nI\u2019d like to think I got better with it all, though. I took the time to think about what it was that I needed from my friends to make me feel like they actually cared about me and wanted me to be around them and things quickly fixed themselves. I think surrounding myself with my friends was the only thing keeping me in check. \n\n**PROFESSORS**\n\nMy junior year, one of my professors noticed that I wasn\u2019t performing as well as I should have been. We had a couple zoom meetings and she basically asked me what was up. I didn\u2019t really know what to say because I wasn\u2019t really aware of my mental well-being. I think I ended up telling her how it\u2019s been hard coming to a new college and that I\u2019m just adjusting to being in person. Looking back, I think it was true but I should have definitely started looking at mental health resources that year. I think a part of me was just scared to admit I had any mental health issues. \n\nTo another junior year professor, I dislike how stupid you made me feel in your office hours. In fact, you\u2019re the sole reason I stopped going to any office hours altogether and it bit me in the ass. Again, after reflecting, I realize that I should have just not let it bother me but it\u2019s really hard to just ignore the feeling that your professor might think you\u2019re stupid. I feel like the older professors don\u2019t really care much about how their students are doing? I could be wrong but those were the vibes I was feeling. He just didn\u2019t explain things to me fully despite my efforts to clear up any of the questions I had previously asked. \n\nMy advisor wasn\u2019t any better. Junior year, when students around me were talking about GREs or whatever, I didn\u2019t have the slightest fucking idea what that meant. After all, my parents didn\u2019t go to college. They were immigrants who relied on their daughter to read every form for them. I had to fill out my own FAFSA, figure out my own college plan, and figure out everything else that came after. This isn\u2019t to say that I am the only one with this struggle but I was not made aware of all the resources at BU that could have helped me navigate college as a first generation student. Where does my advisor come into all of this? For starters, she\u2019s an old white woman. I don\u2019t think she knows the first thing about being dropped into the deep end and having to figure things out all by yourself.   \nI wanted to pursue grad school. I wanted to actually do something meaningful with my life but I didn\u2019t have any clue how to even start. All she saw were my failed classes and how my GPA was dropping. As someone who\u2019s in charge of my classes, I think a simple conversation about how I am doing mentally rather than academically would help, too. Anyone in a position of some sort of power at this school could have shown the slightest bit of empathy and things could have maybe been different.   \nInternships? Not a chance. Sophomore year was completely virtual so no one was taking in anyone for an internship. Junior year, I didn\u2019t know where to even begin looking. I inquired about them during a meeting with my advisor when picking courses and I believe I was simply directed to a link sent through email. Great, one more thing I need to do by myself. I felt incapable. I knew I wasn\u2019t the only one doing things by myself but everyone around me seemed like they knew what they were doing. I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but imposter syndrome was slowly creeping up on me.\n\nI\u2019ve always disliked history class. Every time I take one, I can\u2019t stand being in the room for any longer than I need to be. Nothing wrong with it, but it completely bores me. I do want to give a shout out to the professor and TA that reached out to me when I stopped attending classes and took the time to meet with me on zoom. It took 3 semesters for someone to do that and gently place me back on track. I felt relieved knowing that my absence actually meant something. It gave me a reason to stop laying in bed all day and feeling bad about myself. However, this meant going to a history class\u2026\n\nMy final semester was kind of a shitshow. One of my classes related to my major seemed exciting, when I stepped into class on the first day. I felt like it was something I could totally get a grasp of and feel like I belonged there. There were only like 12 students in the class so I really didn\u2019t want to (mentally) stick out. However, I fucked up. \n\nYou may or may not have heard of ChatGPT. Let this be a lesson: do *not* use it to edit a paper you\u2019ve written for an assignment worth like a hundred goddamn points. This professor very kindly let me rewrite some of the portions to regrade. What he didn\u2019t know was that a couple days before the deadline, I was having another mental breakdown. I had already asked for an extension and I didn\u2019t think writing an email saying \u201chey just to lyk, not feeling mentally ok\u201d would be alright. In fact, it might have raised quite a few red flags and me being the person I am, did not want to bring any more attention to it than I needed to. \n\nAs time went along, I stopped showing up to classes. Some mornings, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to leave my bed. I was starving myself and would eat once a day, at 8 or 9 PM. I am not *unhealthy*, according to US beauty standards, but I definitely was not, and am not, healthy by any means. \n\nSo much was happening all at once. I wasn\u2019t doing well on assignments, I wasn\u2019t eating, and I wasn\u2019t communicating with my mom about ANY of this. I finally had a meeting with this professor but even then couldn\u2019t even fully tell him what was going on. In my head, I thought \u201che\u2019s not a therapist and he does not get paid to care about my wellbeing\u201d but I don\u2019t know\u2026maybe I should have. Maybe then things could have been different. It\u2019s in the past now though but damn, hindsight is a crazy thing. \n\n**GRADUATION**\n\nI didn\u2019t walk. \n\nThe past month before graduation, I was having an internal struggle about whether or not I should walk. I didn\u2019t even purchase a cap and gown because of this and part of me wishes I felt different. \n\nHowever, my decision to not walk was my own and with the way I am feeling, I wouldn\u2019t change that decision. I do wish I could change how I felt and am feeling, though. The reason I didn\u2019t walk was because I genuinely felt like I did not deserve to. I couldn\u2019t stand up there in line, waiting to walk, surrounded by people who I know are infinitely smarter than I am. They passed their classes. They did what they were supposed to. If I walked, I still had to take 4 classes, due to my class failures and some of my transfer credits not going through. I still would be bound to this school, whether or not I walked on May 21st. \n\nAgain: \n\n**I felt like I did not deserve to walk.** \n\nI genuinely hope that no one *ever* feels that way. It fucking hurts being in that mindset. I wanted to give my mom the opportunity to see her daughter walk and shake her professors\u2019 hands. I wanted her to take a video of me walking across, smiling, and posing at the end with my red diploma folder. But I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t stroll across, knowing there were professors up there who knew I did poorly in their class. They knew this wouldn\u2019t be my last time on campus. \n\nThese thoughts made me embarrassed to even consider walking. I was on the fence for a while, all the way up until the night before I had to walk. But I couldn\u2019t let go of those emotions. \n\nI lied and told my mom that it would be too crowded anyway and that it wasn\u2019t worth making the trip. The trip being only 40 minutes if you account for traffic. At the time of writing this, I have a lump in my throat, knowing that my mom, who worked so hard for me to come to this school, did not get to see me walk. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever regret not walking, but it does hurt knowing I took it away from her. \n\nI really wish I had someone reach out to me and just tell me that everything would be okay and that I didn\u2019t need to feel embarrassed. I wish I had someone tell me that I deserve to walk with everyone else. \n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS**\n\nI wrote this all in like, two hours. I cannot get everything I have ever thought of in this document. That would require me to actually sit down and think about my feelings and I\u2019d rather not. Again, this isn\u2019t an attack on any of my professors, but I do hope you think about your students and if you notice them skipping class, they\u2019re probably going through some shit.",

            "comment": "I can\u2019t attest to your mental health issues, but when you reflect in the future I hope you\u2019ll consider 2 things:\n\n1) COVID is not a cop out answer. Millions of high school and college students have had their grooves of learning pace completely fucked from this pandemic. I had two years of college under my belt when COVID hit and I can tell you the general atmosphere, motivation, and preparedness of students has been so much worse. I taught classes at my undergrad and now at BU and pre vs post pandemic has just been night and day.\n\n2) This is my experience that others may not share, but the people who say \u201ccollege is the best years of your life\u201d tended to either have bad grades or majors with a lot of easy classes. Occasionally there\u2019s someone who has an insane work ethic and regiments their time such that they can go be social after 5 PM, but upon hanging around dozens of high-achieving students I can count the number of people like that on one hand. Ultimately what college is supposed to be can depend on your field. For some majors, it may simply be a pipeline to graduate school or government/public sector related work. For other majors (like engineering in theory) you are there to get an internship and eventually work at a company right out of school. For some majors the purpose is almost entirely to put you in touch with people that can get you jobs. \n\n\nDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself, identify what you can do in the future to improve your work flow, and just remember once you pass the classes you need that crawling past the finish line is still finishing. Best of luck!",

While my experiences at BU were in many ways different than yours, I share all of your feelings, all of the way up to walking for graduation. My college experience was in no way what I expected, and more of a rollercoaster that descended far more than it ascended. I am a fellow first-gen student, and it is 100% a different experience for us than for those with family that can help guide them through it. Add that to struggles with mental health and you're in for a rough couple of years. BU is really lacking in mental health services and support for students. I won't get into too much detail here, but if you want to talk to someone who was in a similar boat, feel free to message me! It's so easy to feel like just another number on BU's roster of thousands of students, but you are never alone in your feelings. As much as it sucks to struggle in college, at the very least there's a decent amount of us that can all relate to each other, even if we don't get to meet each other. \ud83d\ude05",

It was so bad that they stopped giving us advising codes and just made us able to register for anything because the entire department couldn\u2019t meet with her by their registration dates. I switched to art history and my advisors now are caring, kind, and check in on my mental health and offer resources every time we meet. The culture shock was real!

The issue is knowing that someone is distressed and all that happened after the call was \"hey heres this paper with a list of therapists\". It just seems off putting that they didn't make a follow up call asking if I found a therapist that worked or something. Not saying it's on them personally, but there should be some sort of protocol in place for these types of situations. I mean, I was on a zoom call with the guy they made me an appointment with, and I was fully in tears saying I was feeling terrible. I think people are thinking that a phone call would change things, but I'm just trying to say that it would make me think they are attempting to care about the students that call them. Even an automated message asking for an update of some sort through email would've worked, maybe even prompted me to call back and say \"hey, this actually didn't work\"",

What you suggest is a seemingly small act that likely would help numerous students take that next step, which is as difficult as the first one was. You reached out for help and were given a list and had to summon the strength to take the next step. \n\nSometimes, particularly when we are overwhelmed with emotional pain, we simply don\u2019t have the capacity to summon that strength again so soon. I have supervised work study students who have been given that list. What I\u2019ve done is alter the student\u2019s work duties for their shift. I give them my work space and tell them that their job for the shift is to make those calls. I bring them a glass of water, take my laptop, close the door, and find a space to work in a common area while they summon the strength to plow through the list. \n\nIf any admins read this and students confide in you and you are able to do something similar, I urge you to do so.",

I can attest how hard it is to get the help you need, even when you take the first steps, it doesn't make taking the next ones any easier. The systems in place are very hard to navigate for someone struggling with mental health, and I agree that BU should take a more active role on ensuring students continue to work on getting to a better place. You did what you were able to at the time, and that's amazing in of itself. Many people don't even get as far as you did. I have struggled many times to take those same steps, you'd think it'd get easier every time I fall into a deep depression, but unfortunately it doesn't. I assume this person has not struggled with mental health, or if they have, their circumstances were different, as they are for all who struggle. Don't let anyone talk down to you for this, if you're anything like me you talk down to yourself enough without people making comments like this. \ud83d\ude09 You deserve to be kind to yourself and have others treat you as such too.",

But...they have no availability and and severely overbooked/worked. When I went through a bad health period right before graduating (I lost my regular insurance and the wait for any state mental health resources was months long) I felt so 'lucky' to be able to get a *few* free appointments with SHS. Which is messed up, but I say this purely to not dissuade others from trying to see SHS/BM when they are struggling. I'm not sure how it has changed over the course of the pandemic, but I can only imagine they are really busy. (Which is not an excuse for the institution - BU needs to do a lot more in terms of its student support infrastructure.) There are great people and initiatives across campus, they just need to be funded and staffed appropriately.\nI hope you are able to get the supports you need now (even if they should have been there all along). If you need any help finding low-cost health services in/around Boston now, let me know. I have some experience navigating that field (I am also an only child of eastern European immigrants, so I know the challenge of not having family that is familiar with the convoluted US health system.)",

It's almost like an alcoholic, gambling or drug addict checking themselves into a facility.  You have to take that first step yourself. The first step is the most important step. No one can do that for you. They can only point you to where you should go. I hope you seek help. Work life is just as stressful. It doesn't get better post college. In life, you will always have constant stress and continue yo face adversity.  I wish you well.",

I have sought out help and my complaints are that the resources out there meant to help people aren\u2019t all that helpful. I\u2019m not sure if you read my entire post but most of this is me saying that things happened, how I dealt with it, and I think professors should be more aware of what\u2019s going on. Surely you\u2019re not suggesting that my mental health issues are solely on me, right? It\u2019s a product of my environment",

Taking paid leave time for mental health or family mental health reasons is extremely common. I absolutely cared and appreciated when my team members kept me in the loop. Details aren\u2019t necessary - all I need is enough information to help me plan and help you from a work perspective, whether that\u2019s hiring a temporary contractor while you\u2019re on leave, or pairing you with another team member who can help take the load off. I realize this isn\u2019t the case with all managers, and that what you\u2019re saying may have been the norm up until recently, so I understand the sentiment. Please give your managers - particularly millennials - the opportunity to help you! There\u2019s no need to suffer in silence and on your own with us at the helm. :) And while we may be limited in the scope of what we can do in a professional position for your personal mental health, we\u2019ll do our best to help ease the pressure professionally so you can have space to do the personal work. \n\nThis may be what you meant, but I just wanted to clarify. I would hate for anyone to feel like they can\u2019t talk to me about mental health because I am their boss, especially as someone who has personally struggled with anxiety and depression. I can\u2019t be a therapist in my role because obviously I\u2019m not qualified, but what I can help with is managing workload, navigating leave time if you need it, making it so you can go to therapy appointments as needed during business hours, etc.",

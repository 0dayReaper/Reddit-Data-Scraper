Most are moving across the country. I\u2019m starting at a big company where I\u2019ll be the only person my age and most people are in their 40s. How am I supposed to expand my social circle when I\u2019ll be spending 8 hours in person every day with people so far from my stage in life?",

Or you could find your people in activities/hobbies/passions and cultivate after work places for pub fun and sports etc.  Some friends of mine join writing, theatre groups, and book groups and others do all kinds of sports... Also just hanging out where the people are, there's a great pub on Comm ave called Hopewell for example that has good food and a lot of goings on.",

I'm in grad school, but I also did my undergrad here in Boston. Close to every single friend I made has left Boston, whereas I decided to stay and make a life here. \n\nThe best way to make friends is to go out and meet people, but more important be the person who invites people out. Throw parties. Set up gatherings.",

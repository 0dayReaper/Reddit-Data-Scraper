As long as you have a valid government-issued driver's license u can drive a uhaul.\n\nJust be very competent and confident in your driving ability if you plan to drive such a big car in Boston.\n\n(just check the uhaul faq; can easily find site with a google search or if needed can always give uhal customer support a call if you want to see if they can give any clarifications)",

            "comment": "In my experience, the course was challenging but rewarding. Professor Keylor was highly knowledgeable and passionate about the subject matter. His lectures were engaging, and he encouraged class discussions and critical thinking.\r  \n\rTo get an A in the course, I found that attending lectures regularly, actively participating in class discussions, and completing the assignments on time were important. The grading criteria were clearly outlined in the syllabus, which helped me understand what was expected of me. Professor Keylor was also approachable and available during office hours to provide additional guidance and clarification.",

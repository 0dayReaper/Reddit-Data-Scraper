We are humans/ social mammals, we shouldn't eat alone. It's better to try and eat meals in the company of friends, even if it's by zoom or ft (ideally in person). Trust me, we are not meant to eat alone for the majority of our meals (if that's part of your situation)",

I like to literally cycle through a loose list of people whenever I start getting lonely: best friends, then friends and family ranked in order of how much I like them. Sometimes you get lucky and find yourself an hour deep into a phonecall talking about something meaningful to you. Those calls help, and over time make you less lonely- and also help you realize who has your back + who wants to deepen their bond/connection w you",

From the outside, it looked like I had everything, friends, a good social life, etc. But when I looked around me I didn\u2019t feel deeply connected to anyone. I graduated 5 years ago, and now I realize how college is just a blip in your life and it doesn\u2019t have to affect the way you live the rest of your life. I moved to another country, made amazing friends, starting doing things I was passionate about. It was hard. In college, you don\u2019t have to think about what you ~actually~ want in life. You just study and take tests. Being out of college will force you to understand what you want out of life. Like someone else said, you have the rest of your life to live!",

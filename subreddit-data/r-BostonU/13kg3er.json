    "postText": "I have a guaranteed transfer admission and I\u2019m going to go to BU this fall, but I am worried that my admission may get rescinded. I had A\u2019s and B\u2019s this year but I had one single F and it was in my second semester. My gpa for the whole year was above a 3.0 which is what I believe I saw on one of their emails was the recommended gpa to stay above, but I\u2019m still worried that the F will cause me trouble. There are people on this sub in similar situations that say BU never really cared, and then there are some with horror stories. If anyone has some advice I\u2019d appreciate it.",

I do know for certain there is a GPA requirement so u shouldddd be fine if it\u2019s above idk what it is but 3.0?? Unsure if they\u2019ve emailed u more info so def check",

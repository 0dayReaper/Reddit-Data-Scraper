If you don\u2019t do that it\u2019s inconsiderate and if your laundry gets taken out so somebody else can do their laundry, you shouldn\u2019t get upset about it. Especially if your clothes are dry, your cycle completed, and you weren\u2019t there within 5 (maybe 10, but that\u2019s a stretch) minutes of your cycle finishing. \n\nBut if somebody takes a persons clothes out of the dryer while the dryer is still going AND THEN they put their clothes into the dryer on somebody else\u2019s cycle... that\u2019s fucked up, not okay, and is straight up stealing.\n\nObviously that\u2019s not what happened here in this instance, but having experienced the latter in the past two weeks in south, I\u2019m still annoyed and it unfortunately for some reason needs to be said.",

Like hard science and CS majors are lumped in with poly sci/IR and humanities majors, no shade to anyone (ofc humanities majors have their work cut out with networking and such) but if we talk pure class difficulty the science and CS majors have a lot harder time getting the high GPAs required here. Would be interesting to see gpa breakdowns by major within CAS.\n\nEvery other college (QST, ENG, COM) have similar caliber of difficulty within but you cannot compare a chem major and an English major.",

    "postText": "Hi guys I am a HS senior thinking about applying to BU COM. My GPA and SAT are high so BU is more like a safety for me, and I'm independently wealthy so money isn't a problem. I just want to find a school that's a good fit.\n\nI was wondering what the culture is like and if it's easy to make friends (not like just people you talk to in class, but actual friends). Also, is it a friendly environment for conservatives or is there alot of \"wokeness\" going on? I'm fine with social justice stuff and whatnot as long as people don't expect me to support it.",

We are a college and colleges are notoriously liberal. The fact that you\u2019re even worried about wokeness says a lot more about you than it does about the conservatives at BU. \n\u201cI\u2019m fine with social justice stuff as long as people don\u2019t expect me to support it\u201d yeah you\u2019re going to have a lot of problems likely on any campus that you go to??

            "comment": "Please be careful about calling BU a safety for you. I had a 1530 sat and 3.97 gpa with national merit and a national music award, plus captain of a sports team and also thought BU was a safety/match. When decisions came out, I was rejected or waitlisted then rejected from all my reaches and even one of my targets (northeastern). I opened BU last, and BU didn\u2019t feel so safe anymore. I was very fortunate to get in and I\u2019m now enrolled but please don\u2019t call any selective school a safety (especially one with a 10% acceptance rate). I thought I would for sure get into one of my reaches but opening all those rejection letters destroyed my ego. (I also had a lot of financial need which could have been a factor but college admissions is hard to predict so don\u2019t bet on getting into any selective school)\n\nIn terms of culture, I\u2019m not a com major so I can\u2019t speak directly to that. I was also concerned going into college that I wouldn\u2019t find friends who actually connected with me well. First semester was difficult but second semester I met some math peers who share my sense of humor and have stimulating math conversations with me. BU is a massive school, but there\u2019s lots of small, super smart groups of people that will match your interests/goals. Go to splash (the club fair) and youll find some group that catches your eye. As long as you\u2019re trying new things and open to talking to new people you\u2019ll find your people.\n\nIn terms of political views, I think that you would be fine expressing them, but a lot of people will likely initially disagree with you. A vast majority of people at BU are really nice so I don\u2019t think anyone would be rude to you because of your political beliefs.\n\nOne more thing, if you\u2019re interested in com, I suggest looking at the bu bulletin to see the requirements for each major to get a better idea of what it\u2019s like to actually study at BU. \n\nhttps://www.bu.edu/academics/com/",

It\u2019s a really big school and you can find anyone here, but the average is definitely skewed towards progressive politics.\n\nThat said, you really shouldn\u2019t be picking a college based on that. Look for schools where you\u2019ll be challenged, academically and otherwise. At BU, you\u2019ll find people with radically different views to your own and most of the time they\u2019ll be happy to discuss those differences amicably. And definitely don\u2019t look for a school based on having a high proportion of white and asian students as good thing. That\u2019s\u2026 problematic.\n\nAnyway, if you want to study in a city, you\u2019ll likely be in a very liberal campus regardless of where you go. If that\u2019s something you\u2019d rather avoid, I\u2019d suggest Brigham Young (and they have good Communications programs too).

And although your family is wealthy you are not nearly wealthy enough for that to play a role in your acceptance.

A lot of them are rich and come here with a plan to graduate and get a six figure job. Just don\u2019t be racist to them or tell them jokes or even flirt with them because that\u2019s not common in their culture.

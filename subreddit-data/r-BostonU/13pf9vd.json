    "postText": "has anyone not paid full summer term fee on due date? I just paid a little short of 2k of my $3360 class payment and I know it\u2019s due today. I was wondering if BU handles it the same as for fall and spring semesters where if u submit at least a portion of the payment, they will not charge the late fee. I\u2019ve been so caught up with graduation that I hadn\u2019t taken the time to call and ask.\n\nAlso, is there fr no financial aid for summer terms? I emailed a while back and they said no but i\u2019m rlly wondering how &gt;3k for a single class is affordable. i\u2019m only taking it because it\u2019s a requirement.",

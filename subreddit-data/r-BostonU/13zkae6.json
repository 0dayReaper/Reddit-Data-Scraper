A BOARD GAME GROUUP\n\nBut seriously tho, anybody wanna get a group together and play board games (extra points if you're in Myles). Im thinking of playing games that take large groups and involve deception, negotiation, and group politics (looking at things like Dune, King's Dilemma, and Diplomacy).\n\nPM if interested!",

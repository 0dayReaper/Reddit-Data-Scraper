Already, alumni and ex students can not access the new MyBU Student landing/homepage. They can still access specific student link menus via the direct URLs, which the error message provides. Right now, the underside of student link is still the same and alumni still have access. But once that gets upgraded to the new system, alumni won\u2019t have access from my current understanding and based on the error messages already received on the homepage.",

I (class of \u201812) can no longer access the student link. \n\nI have to say, I kinda love that the StudentLink still has that awful 90s organization. Much better than what I experienced at five other institutes of similar size and standing (2 public, 3 private) in that it\u2019s actually usable and navigable, even if it looks ancient.",

I applied for a room change request for a single in an apartment; how likely is it that I\u2019ll get one? If not I\u2019ll probably look of campus, as my severe insomnia won\u2019t be very helpful in living with a stranger.",

I\u2019m not sure if insomnia would be enough to get me a single in their opinion but I\u2019m trying to get documentation at the moment",

(i\u2019ve heard some not so good things about bu\u2019s disability offices so some advice may be helpful)",

            "comment": "Hi friend, I received accommodations for my ADHD (I\u2019m a grad student on the med campus but the process is the same as for undergrads). My accommodations are 50% extra time on exams, 48 hour extensions on assignments, and a quiet room to test in (if I wanted it but most the time I didn\u2019t use it) I also received the testing accommodations for my CPCE but I had to request a separate letter for that\n\nI started the process in later April and they got approved in mid June. Start the process soon because they are much less busy during the summer \n\n1. I submitted my documents to the student disability/accessibility office on their online portal.\n \n2. I called the office, explained I needed to get accommodations and needed them to review my documents and they set up a meeting with Dr. Wolf (some people don\u2019t like her but whatevs it\u2019s a necessary step to get approved faster)\n\n3. About 6 weeks later I received an email explaining the accommodations they approved me for and confirmation I was registered\n\n4. At the beginning of every semester I\u2019d login to their website and send the accommodations letter through their online portal. \n\nGood luck! Also definitely call their office once you\u2019ve submitted Sometimes they\u2019re slow to respond to emails and calling definitely expedites the process",

My documentation was old so they said I needed a letter from psychiatrist with my ADHD diagnosis but it required no neuropsych testing , she just just used a 10 minute screening tool. \n\nBut I also have NVLD which requires the full neuropsych testing battery for diagnosis and my documentation was from like 4th grade so they told me it would be best just use my ADHD diagnosis for accommodations \n\nGood addition",

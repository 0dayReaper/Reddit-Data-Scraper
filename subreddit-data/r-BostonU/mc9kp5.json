    "postText": "I literally created a Reddit account for the sole purpose of this post. I was walking down COM ave and this old man stopped me to ask me if I believed in a creator and asked me if I was religious and kept handing me these little handouts and I could not find a way to leave. This girl in a bright pink sweater came up to me and asked me if I was in her class and I said yes in econ, and then we hurried away because we were going to \"work on the homework together\". I literally got to my dorm room and just burst into tears because I don't think a stranger has ever been so concerned or caring about my safety. If you are the girl, please PM me, I would love to take you out for coffee.",

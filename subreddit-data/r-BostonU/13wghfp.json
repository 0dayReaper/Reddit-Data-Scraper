Rather than having to pay for those individual classes or sign up for the PDP during the regular year, fitpass classes are available at various times of day and if you have the fitpass you can attend any of them whenever you want, without having to pay because you already bought the pass.\n\nIt's a good way to sample the different classes FitRec offers without having to fully commit to a specific class/sport/exercise type and not waste your money if you didn't want to go back to that same class after the first session.",

I had my hard times but i also did have good times and if i can graduate, anyone can. For those of u stressing out about ur future and ur grades, i did it so u can do it too! And for my graduating friends u guys worked so hard for this and good luck on ur future!!!! \n\nSorry i can get very sentimental sometimes lol thanks for reading for those who did",

            "comment": "BU is a weird place. It's the only college I ever went to where the exams didn't match the lecture content at all. The grading curve in science courses was absolutely nuts. Coincidentally it's the only place including colleges I've ever had a below 3.0 GPA. I literally had a 3.6+ at other colleges including a 4.0 at a certain rival college down Comm Ave.    \n\n\nGraduated BU with a Biology degree over a decade ago but went to nursing school as that Bio degree couldn't pay the bills nor get any real job offers. Best decision ever",

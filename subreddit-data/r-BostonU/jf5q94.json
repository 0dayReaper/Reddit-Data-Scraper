It's better that we get someone who isn't political, especially in this era of political division. This is purely from the lens of getting more attendance and excitement about commencement, I'm not justifying or giving any moral credence to right wing ideas (which are selfish, cruel, hypocritical garbage).",

They probably grew up in right-leaning families and don't fully understand the harm that they do when they vote for republicans. That's why I think we should have a speaker that doesn't automatically turn all those people off (no matter how stupid their reasons are) since we want a commencement that includes all, even those that are politically misguided.",

    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019ve found a roommate going into freshman year at BU, and we\u2019re both queer and signed up for gender affirming housing. However, nobody\u2019s giving me a straight answer on which buildings have it! Kind of an important question, because we\u2019re both CFA and we don\u2019t exactly want to walk all the way across campus to get to class. Let me know if you have an answer!",

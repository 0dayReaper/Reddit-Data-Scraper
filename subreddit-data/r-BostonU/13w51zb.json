(it'll also mean I'm gonna take CDS DS 320 fall of Sophomore year idk if that's good either)",

Seniors can take 100 level courses. Freshmen can take 400 level courses. What matters is whether or not you have met the prereqs for the course (have AP credit OR know some Python is the prereq for 110, and DS 110 is the prereq for 210). Taking a course like DS 210 is perfectly normal for a second semester freshman, and DS 110 -&gt; DS 210 is literally a sequence so you SHOULD take 210 in the spring if you take 110 in the fall.",

I took mostly 200 levels my freshman year b/c of AP credit and was fine. There will usually be people of all grades in your classes regardless of level.",

            "comment": "As a data science major with a few good friends also in data science, I\u2019d recommend *not* taking DS100. I personally didn\u2019t take it because of AP credit but most of my friends took it and told me it was a waste of time. I feel that I could have taken DS110 without any coding experience because of how much time is spent on learning python. DS110 is not a hard class at all, but 210 is a bit of a jump up in difficulty. Definitely talk to your advisor before locking in DS100.\n\nIn terms of course numbers, I agree with what everyone else here is saying. I took a 400 level math class second semester freshman year and did fine. CAS MA213 Basic Stats and Probability is also not a super difficult class (subjective though) that would be good to take freshman year because of its relevance in alot of other ds classes.\n\nA little unrelated, but is there any reason you are doing data science over comp sci? It\u2019s good to have a solid reason to choose one over the other (not including reasons like \u201cI want to make money\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s a new major\u201d). At the moment, DS210 does not transfer over to CS112, so it would be annoying to switch to cs later on (though CS112 can count for DS210).\n\nhttps://www.bu.edu/academics/cas/programs/computer-science/ba/",

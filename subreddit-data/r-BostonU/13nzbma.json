The protest is the natural and necessary consequence of BU's decision. The protesters are the ones grads and their families should be looking to for inspiration today, not Zaslav.",

His being the head of an exploitative labor organization just didn't matter enough to BU not to offer him as an inspirational figure to its community.",

            "comment": "Hey!!! I commented this a few months ago, but thought it would apply here. I am a commuting student so have to spend extended periods in study spaces/cafes since I don't have a room to return to. Overall, this really depends on your preferences. Like what noise level you prefer, do you want food nearby, do you like desks, armchairs, couches, booths, tables, or want to be close to classes etc. Walking around and exploring/trying out different spaces was very helpful for me to get familiar with the campus tbh, so I would def recommend doing that at some point! Here is my list though:\n\n&gt;CGS basement: very quiet, comfortable couches  \nBU Central (GSU basement): Talking level sounds, not too loud, not crowded, seconds away from food/coffee, comfy booths  \nMugar Library: Dead silent and always too hot or too cold in my opinion, but some people like it  \nCAS: take over an empty classroom with spinny chairs and tables, lots of space but possibility of being kicked out when a class starts  \nCDS: Spark area couches are really comfy, coffee and breakfast/grilled cheese downstairs, but always very busy. 13th floor has comfy office chairs and nice views, but study area closes really early, like 6pm  \nQuestrom Starbucks: Very busy and hard to get a seat, but if I can get a booth I can stay there all  \nSCI building basement: Nice spinny chairs and tables. Cute turtles to look at upstairs\n\nLmk if directions/more info on campus spaces would be helpful!!",

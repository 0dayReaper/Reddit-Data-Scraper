My first year was much more focused on classroom work, my middle years were a mix of teaching/working in a lab, while my last six months were mostly spent writing my thesis. To get a good answer you'd have to talk to people in the specific program you're considering. I had to do interviews as part of my PhD application, and I got to meet current students when I interviewed. For me that was really valuable to get a sense of the work expectations and culture of the program and it helped me decide where to go.",

They told me that I can still switch majors after completing a semester at BU. I want to know if any transfer students has tried to cross transfer schools at BU, was it a difficult process and are you still going to graduate on time?",

Was a very simple process for me but idk how it works going from Something else to questrom. \n\nIf they give you a hard time you can always easily go to Econ and add a minor in question, depending on what you want to work in. Won\u2019t work for accounting but it\u2019s an idea \n\nI\u2019d recommend going to the general advisors vs your personal one - the ones that are above the Kenmore dining hall",

In the middle of my 2nd semester at BU I met with an advisor and all they had to do was click a few buttons and it went through. And I graduated on time but did have to take a couple of summer classes to do so.",

            "comment": "I switched WITHIN my school before I began my first semester at BU lol. If you KNOW that you are going to switch, just take the classes you need to for your intended major. Like if you're currently a bio major and want to be a business major, your first semester schedule could literally be business 1, business 2, business X, etc with no bio. No one can stop you if you've got the prereqs. Whether or not you can complete your degree on time is a separate question.\n\nThe issue with QST is that they have lots of prereqs to get INTO the school with in IUT (intra university transfer). See [HERE](https://www.bu.edu/academics/questrom/policies/intra-university-transfer/). Also, I'm not sure what year standing you have, but QST has a rule that you need to have 5 semester at BU (not a different school), to graduate. See [HERE](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/admissions/undergraduate/transfer/). So if you're a junior you're SOL\n\nI would recommend reaching out to [Questrom advising](https://www.bu.edu/advising/your-advisors/find-the-right-advisor/questrom-school-of-business/) and ask to meet / express your interest and commitment in pursuing a business major. They help students who want business degrees for a living and might be able to expedite the process for you. Admissions just gets enrollments...",

You\u2019ll just need a code from the current major advisor, but an email explaining the situation should be fine. \nThen, assuming you do well in the first sem at BU, you fill out a transfer form and you\u2019re done.",

You have to take a bunch of prereqs before you can officially get in. It\u2019s not a new application process, it just takes time. Just try to get started on the needed intro classes your first semester and you\u2019ll probably be fine. Tbh you probably made it easier on yourself getting accepted as a transfer into CAS compared to Questrom. As an IUT I\u2019ve had to take some summer classes and overload a semester or two, but I\u2019m definitely set to graduate in time.",

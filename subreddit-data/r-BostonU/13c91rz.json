    "postText": "I put off applying for like a month because I was afraid to make the phone call to fix an issue with my application. Literally took ninety seconds so I'm an idiot. I'm an incoming freshman and ranked warren #1. Do I have a solid shot at getting a dorm there? Low-key in love with warren \ud83d\ude2d ik everyone complains but I'm already romanticizing. I also put location as my top priority if that helps. Didn't pick a roommate, going random.",

Large freshmen dorms like that are basically last choice for anyone who is not an incoming student. You'll be fine, I'm pretty sure you'll get it since housing has not been assigned yet, and just know there is always the opportunity to switch if you are assigned somewhere else since there will be lots of upperclassmen trying to get OUT of Warren haha",

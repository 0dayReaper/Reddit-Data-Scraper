The Dean got back to me the next day and not only was super enthusiastic to call me by my chosen name but also noticed my dead name is on my diploma and asked if I would like that changed and directed me to resources on how to do that.\n\nThank you BU for caring about your trans and non-binary graduates &lt;3",

You could probably make it work, but keep in mind you more than likely will have a roommate that's like 5ft away from you. I'd say bring the gaming rig to your sophomore year dorm and just use a laptop your first year.",

My most recent build crams an entire PC into 3.7 liters which saves on space. You just need to make sure the PC you bring with you won\u2019t take up a lot of room. Also as u/bobsmith97bs says don\u2019t be that guy. Aside from that I wish you the best!",

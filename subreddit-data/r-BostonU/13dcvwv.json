I was admitted to the MSCS program at BU and am planning to take classes part-time while working full-time and I'm looking for some insights from current or former CS students.\n\nHow are the courses and the workloads? Is BU incredibly difficult to do well in? How are the professors?\n\nAnyone who has taken 500-600 level courses: Do you think taking 2 classes would be manageable while working full-time?",

            "comment": "I think 2 + FT might be hard, but I don't think it's impossible depending on whatever job you might have. I am a BA/MS student, so keep that in mind. Classes are honestly not that much harder than undergrad classes, but some depend on having previous knowledge so you might have to do some self-study to catch up. There are some courses that are super intense, and some that are super chill, and it usually always depends on the professor, so make sure to look at RateMyProfessor in order to make informed decisions on what to take. Again, I think in terms of success, some professors set you up really well to succeed provided you put in the hours, but some don't give a flying f about your wellbeing and do not make themselves readily available outside of class for help.",

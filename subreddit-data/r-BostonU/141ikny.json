    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman trying to schedule a writing course, and I'm a little scared by the amount of reading I have to do (both by the course description and by student reviews on RMP), especially when I have one unavoidable heavy-course-load foreign language course already. Currently, I'm looking into taking Giraldi's Memoir section because the topic looks interesting to me. My other option is to go down a level and take WR112 (since I'm an international student). My overall goal is to make sure I have a good GPA for my freshman year.\n\nTherefore, my questions are:\n\n1. For WR120, have there been people who tried the strategy of reading all the books in the summer so that they don't have to spend that much time reading during the semester? Has this strategy worked out for them? Do you get tons of reading in WR120 that is NOT part of the books?\n2. What are some professors of WR120 who are pretty chill and don't assign that much reading? When the majority of the topics are not interesting to me, I'd really prefer not to have to do that much reading.\n\nThanks in advance for your response!\n\nEdit: wow thanks everyone for your quick and detailed response! Sorry, I should've been more clear about my situation. This is the first time I've used online forums like Reddit so I apologize for the confusion. I'm a CAS student and the foreign language course does indeed refer to the CAS Foreign Language requirement (which I now realize doesn't actually apply to me). I've already taken the MWP placement and I was placed into WR120.",

Often times the prof won't actually get thru all the books within the semester, and pretty much all of the books chosen will have great summaries and videos online that u can pull from anyway.\n\nLook on rate my professor for reviews about what goes on in each class - keep in mind u should only value the reviews where they actually put their grade, and its a B or higher.",

                    "comment": "^^ Completely agree with this person. Even if you do get into a wr120/112 class with a topic you like you probably won't be able to fully read through any books/articles/papers assigned. Online summaries and skimming the necessary chapters/sections is gonna be your biggest help when the reading is too long or boring. If you can get pdfs of the texts, there are also web extensions that will read to you or summarize a selected section. I also like to come to class with some talking points on the one section to at least appear to have done the reading.\n\nReading over the summer will be difficult since most profs don't post their syllabus until a week or so before class, sometimes not even until the first day of class. If you can find copies of previous syllabi that can give you an idea of the courseload/types of reading you'll be doing but the content could possibly change.\n\nAs far as grades and having a good gpa, a lot of profs my freshman year had writing contracts which basically say you'll get at least a B if you show you're trying",

            "comment": "I think your questions are more loaded than you think...\n\nYou mentioned that you are an international student. Are you an English language learner (did you submit a TOEFL or similar test?)? If so, you will need to look into placement for writing classes. See [HERE](https://www.bu.edu/writingprogram/writing-program-curriculum/placement/) for info. The Placement Test will decide for you whether you are ready for WR120 or if you need to start with WR112 or 111. You will need to take WR120 at some point, but the placement test will determine when you can take it.\n\nI have never heard of someone doing all of the readings over the summer. Seems like a lot of work, and the content will be less fresh and you will remember less of it than your classmates. Also, some professors assign articles or specific book chapters that you will not know about until the semester begins. In my writing class, most of the readings were not from books, but all WR120 classes are very different so it depends on which one. Def continue to look on RMP.\n\nYou mentioned an \"unavoidable heavy-course-load foreign language course.\" Are you referring to the CAS language requirement? (If not ignore this comment). Are you a native speaker of another language? If so, you are NOT required to do the CAS language requirement. See [HERE](https://www.bu.edu/cas/academics/undergraduate-education/academic-advising/advising/language-advising/foreign-language-requirement/).\n\nAlso, readings are a very important part of college. It is important to learn how to read quickly and prioritize what is important (how to skim through books and take away main concepts). For WR classes, readings are often the only weekly assignments, with only a few papers to write throughout the semester. If the only assignments are readings like in WR classes, then that class is comparably a lower course load class. Many STEM courses have weekly readings ON TOP of weekly problem sets.\n\nFinally, in my opinion GPA should not be your priority. LEARNING, getting the most out of your classes, completing prerequisites, and taking courses that interest you should be your goal. Learning well does often lead to a good GPA, but if getting a 4.0 is your main objective, spend some time thinking about WHY you are attending college.\n\nSorry for such a long response. Lmk if anything doesn't make sense or if you have any other questions!!!!",

You should never hesitate to reach out for help and advocate for yourself (even though sometimes Reddit in particular has some pessimistic people haha). I would strongly recommend talking to an advisor, like a first year advisor or a major advisor, just to make sure you are on the right track. BU degree requirements can have some unclear rules (like with language), so it would be best to speak to someone whose job is to know these requirements to confirm that your course selections are a good fit for you!!\n\nFeel free to reach out / DM me if you ever have any questions; I am always happy to help!",

I mean, you could, but it\u2019s probably best to have the content of the books fresh in your mind when in class and while writing. You could, though.\nFor 2, as I\u2019ve only taken Giraldi, I can only answer for his course. I think 120 was three books around 200 pages each and another short memoir (~10 pages). 151 was only two of those three same books and the short memoir. I didn\u2019t think it was bad at all and you get a lot of time to read them as there aren\u2019t many \u201cfluff\u201d assignments in his class, if any at all. Literally just has you dedicate your time to reading whatever book you\u2019re on for over a week as homework, so even if that might be considered a lot of reading it\u2019s the only thing you\u2019d have to do for his class. Hopefully this is helpful if you do decide to take Giraldi, which I do further recommend after reading your whole post",

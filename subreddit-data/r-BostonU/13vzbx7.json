Back when the print center required you to pick up the print job in person, the print center was closed on veterans Day. Fortunately now the printers are all self-service and you don't have to pick it up from another human.\n\nAnd every student who is a veteran is rightfully pissed that they have to go to class on veterans Day.",

So you have 4 days in total between the last day of classes and first day of finals.\n\nNext fall there's only 1 study day and it does run into the weekend so you get 3 days instead of the usual 4. But they're also not going to be consecutive days. So instead of like 4 days to study for all your finals you'll have 1 day to study for maybe your first final that's on the 15th and then the weekend to study for your other finals.",

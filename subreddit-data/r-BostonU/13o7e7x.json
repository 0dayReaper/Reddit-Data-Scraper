God forbid we end up working for him.\n\nObviously it\u2019s in bad taste to shout curses at him during the speech but the boos were justified. Honestly top five moment when he paused to wait for boos after announcing his final life lesson.",

All these people complaining about how the protests were somehow \u201cdisrespectful\u201d or \u201cinterfered with their celebration\u201d obviously did not have to suffer through an incredibly boring three hour commencement like I did where nothing of interest was said or done. This was actually nice to attend because I got to witness incredible student solidarity.\n\nI said this in another thread, but if you see the all-university commencement as the culmination of all your hard work, you either do not understand what the purpose of higher education is or you are hyping yourself up for nothing. I enjoyed my college-specific graduation. I was with my peers and professors and I heard speeches that were relevant to my experience instead of a whopping 2.5 hour BU hype package targeted at big money alums and givers. I truly believe that my all-university commencement experience would have been enhanced if there had been a projectile vomiting outbreak after the first 30 minutes and we all had to go home.",

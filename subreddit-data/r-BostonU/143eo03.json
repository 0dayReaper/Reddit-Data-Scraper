I am assuming you're at least okay at math if you're pursuing CS, but if it's something you can see yourself tumbling with it could definitely lend to a couple tough semesters. It's definitely doable. I wound up doing math and cs instead of math and econ-- am a dev now",

Obviously you have to be prepared to handle the degrees, but if you\u2019re interested in the AI space an undergraduate CS degree is the right start but you\u2019re going to get much more in depth and technical knowledge with a CS Masters. From my experience you can always build that technical base first and subsequently go work in an econ-adjacent field. Another pairing that could work really well is Econ and Data Science, since through the DS major you get a lower barrier to entry to DS and AI and ML. Just my two cents",

            "comment": "ENG EC414 is also Intro to ML, and is very well-taught by Ishwar. It is challenging, and it might be a little confusing that it is taught in MATLAB, but it does a great job of introducing ML. It focuses on the math behind ML algorithms (not as much neural networks/deep learning) and implementing them from scratch, which MATLAB is actually very well-suited for because it is very easy to implement matrix math in it. \n\nENG EC418 is a solid reinforcement learning course taught by Olshevsky. EC414 is supposedly a prerequisite but you could probably just take it without, since RL is not really covered in 414 so there isn't that much transferable knowledge, just skills. It focuses on proofs and implementing reinforcement learning using PyTorch. \n\nENG EC523 is an alright deep learning course (I took with Kulis) with not terribly useful lectures and a lot of difficult work. It focuses primarily on implementing deep learning architectures in PyTorch. The work takes an extremely long time to debug, so it is mandatory to start the assignments a week or more ahead of the due date. \n\nIDK what the process is like in CAS, but I imagine you could petition to get most of these to count as CS electives. In particular, EC523 was cross-registered in the CS school, so you could definitely get it to count as either.",

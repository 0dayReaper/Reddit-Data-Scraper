    "postText": "If i\u2019m receiving an university scholars scholarship and my gpa is below a 2.0 this semester but a 3.0 last semester, do i still lose it for this upcoming fall? How does it work, do they take cumulative gpa? I\u2019m really worried right now because there is no way my family can afford 32K of tuition for one semester and my mental health really fucked me over so my grades were shit. What should I do? I\u2019m so stressed right now over it please help",

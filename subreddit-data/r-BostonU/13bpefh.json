    "postText": "Senioritis really hit and I did not submit these late assignments my professor had said she would still accept (with a late penalty ofc), I thought I had more time but she has already submitted grades to StudentLink. Are professors allowed to change grades they\u2019ve already submitted? Is it even worth it to reach out to her and send those pending assignments today, even though there\u2019s a good chance she wouldn\u2019t accept them at this point anyway? Should I just email a genuine apology?\n\nI still passed the class, I\u2019m still graduating, it\u2019s more so just for my ego because I know I could have gotten a way better grade in this relatively easy class. Not a huge deal but this is also a professor I like and would ideally like to keep in touch with post-graduation, so I do feel guilty. I did well in all my other classes this semester, it just happened to be this class that got the brunt of my burnout.",

I wouldn\u2019t change the grade at this point if it were me, but if you\u2019re looking for general feedback for your own development without expecting the grade to change, I\u2019d happily give you that if you ask first if it\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t just submit/send the assignments unprompted - grading is work for us! And by the end of the semester we\u2019re likely hitting burnout too.\n\nAlso, if you are honest and explain the situation without expecting a grade change, I know I wouldn\u2019t hold burnout against you and would be happy to keep in touch. \n\nI\u2019ve had this happen a few times. The best thing you can do is talk to the prof when you start feeling burnt out, before grades are due. The next best thing is to accept the situation, but reach out and apologize and open the lines of communication back up. This isn\u2019t just good advice for college - it\u2019s what your manager will want from you when you are starting your career. Congratulations on graduating and don\u2019t worry about the grade - you\u2019ll have other ways to measure your success before you know it. :)",

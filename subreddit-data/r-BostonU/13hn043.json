    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am taking core next semester and was wondering what the set up is, I am currently in the 11:15 am core and am a little worried about how the whole set up is.\n\nHow exactly are you assigned groups and roles in your group? How much time did you guys dedicate to your core group weekly? And what are some tips to having a successful experience I really want to do well in core since my GPA is suffering a bit lol.\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "&gt; How exactly are you assigned groups and roles in your group? \n\nGroup assignment is done by the professors, role assignment ya'll decide between yourselves. In my group it was pretty natural, some people started doing certain things, enjoyed it and were just naturally considered the \"Finance team\" for example. \n\n&gt; How much time did you guys dedicate to your core group weekly? \n\nReally depends throughout the semester. In the first half it's not much honestly, not more than 2 hours a week (with a few exceptions when close to deadlines where we spent around ~4 hours in teamrooms). But as the semester goes on more and more time is spent on the project, to the point where the last week we probably spent some 20 hours together. \n\n&gt; And what are some tips to having a successful experience \n\nMy number one recommendation is when you're assigned to do something for the group even if it's not graded to do it, do it well the first time so you get valuable feedback. A lot of the teams in my sections when doing the submissions that weren't graded didn't put a lot of effort in and got the most basic feedback since they were missing a lot of crucial things. I highly recommend putting the most effort and complete submission possible to show to your professors during this review (even if it's not graded) so that for your final project you have all the basics down and can work on the harder parts.\n\nBut also remember the core project isn't the majority of your grade, a lot of people focus too much on the project and not on their exams and homework. Those matter more. Focus on your individual grade first, use the project as a way to apply what you have learned.",

    "postText": "How do you optimize your food budget? \n\nI am thinking of buying crickets and eating that with rice, chicken, and Brussels sprouts every day. I don't mind if the food I eat for the summer is bland, as long as I get every vitamin and it can keep me going. \n\nAny resources too for free food (i.e., food pantries, etc.)?\n\nI appreciate any other general apartment-ing/adult-ing advice. Will be a fun experience.\n\nThanks!",

You need to figure out some budgeting first if literally all your money is in housing and you have nothing for anything else.\n\nThat said, 80/20 ground beef is the best bang for your buck as it\u2019s the cheapest with the highest calorie content / nutritional value. Also, if you\u2019re buying chicken already why the fuck would you buy crickets. Get your carbs from sweet potatoes and regular potatoes, as those are cheap and nutritional, though not as cheap as rice. The only thing your diet would be missing is vitamin C so you\u2019re gonna have to eat some grapefruit or oranges, whatever\u2019s cheaper, assuming vegetables cover your other needs.",

Still, food pantry food won\u2019t be super nutritious probably, but that could be a resource - just google what\u2019s in Allston. I know there\u2019s one right off Harvard Ave https://allstonbrightonapac.org/services/ , but they do once a month food. \n\nIf this is your first time living alone, experiment with recipes until you find something you can eat consistently, make food in bulk for yourself like rice, beans, meat in 2-4 pound quantities that last a week, and don\u2019t rely on eating out. That\u2019ll be more sustainable and easier than forcing crickets down your throat.",

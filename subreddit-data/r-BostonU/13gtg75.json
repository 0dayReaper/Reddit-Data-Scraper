Rather than focusing on what someone should have done, it is more constructive to try and understand their perspective and the reasons behind their actions. We all have our own unique circumstances and obstacles that can impact our ability to act in a certain way. Taking the time to listen and understand someone's side of the story can lead to better communication and a more supportive environment.",

Even though the semester has ended, colleges often have procedures in place to accommodate grade changes. Make sure to email them asap though because once the grading system is closed, making changes becomes super difficult due to security reasons or extensive administrative processes. Good luck and hope you feel better.",

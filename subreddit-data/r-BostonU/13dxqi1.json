I'll be interning in Boston over the summer, and so I'm looking to sublease an apartment or any place to live from June 10 to end of August (flexible on the dates).\n\nI'm hoping to live near Boston U for the social life, but also curious, will campus and surrounding areas still be social over summer? Also, what are typical rent prices in the area?\n\nThank you!",

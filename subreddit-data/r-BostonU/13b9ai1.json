Being away from my parents and living in a dorm with tons of friends resulted in reckless but also very entertaining experiences. Sophomore year was a more toned down version of Freshman year. Junior year my friends were all split across campus so it was harder to do stuff together as a large group. By the time senior year rolled around, some friends I saw rarely and some friends dropped out/switched schools because they couldn't keep up. Missed hanging out in a giant group of like 12-16 people freshman year to hanging out in a group of like 2-5 people at a time senior year.",

Somehow I managed to finally get a life by the end",

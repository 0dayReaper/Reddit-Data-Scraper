    "postText": "Hey guys, I was wondering if anybody would recommend a good first-year schedule for a Compsci major. I am also planning to minor in innovation and entrepreneurship. So far, I have planned this for the fall:\n\nCS 112 (APCSA Credit)\nCS 131 (5 on AP Calculus so skipping MA123)\nWR 120\nSpanish (will test for level)\n\nWould anybody recommend taking any classes related to my minor? How should my spring semester look, ideally?",

            "comment": "What you have so far is a really great start! For the fourth course I would absolutely recommend taking a course related to your potential minor so you can see if you are def interested in pursuing it. Either the minor class or a HUB class for fall.\n\nFor the spring, I would recommend WR150 (next freshman writing), CS210, another Spanish if needed, otherwise maybe a Group B course (132 is easy imo), and then another minor/HUB course. Get those writing and language classes out of the way ASAP even if they aren't fun!!!!\n\n[This site](https://www.bu.edu/cs/undergraduate/academic-programs/computer-science-major/) has an excel sheet you can downloaded with a recommended 4 year plan, which is of course adjustable but can give you some idea of how to structure things out. I will warn you, registration can get competitive for upper level courses and things might not always go as you expect, so remember to stay flexible and be willing to change plans around.\n\nFeel free to DM me with any questions!!",

            "comment": "I had a very similar first semester courseload with the same incoming credits as you. My fourth course was in a subject I was interested in that ended up becoming a minor. You usually want to take at least one coding class and then maybe a math class each semester, so 112 and 131 is a great start. Definitely try for 210 in the spring as your coding course. Math can be 132 or 237; 235 is the third group B option but most people don't take it unless they're gearing towards crypto/security.",

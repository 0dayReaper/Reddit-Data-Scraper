    "postText": "Hey! \n\nI hope all is well :) I'm an incoming freshman majoring in Biology (CMG) on the pre-med track! I was wondering, is it a bad idea to take PY 105 and CH 101 in the same semester? I heard that CH 101 is a weeder class, but PY 105 seems easy according to most of the posts I've seen. I would appreciate your opinions :)) \n\nThank you!",

And the more advanced bio courses seem to have BI 108 as a prereq, which I have to take in the spring- \n\nanyways, just hoping I'll end up with a good prof!",

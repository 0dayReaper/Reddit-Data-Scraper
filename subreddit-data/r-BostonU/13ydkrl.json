    "postText": "Hey all, I\u2019m an incoming freshman and I registered for all of my classes yesterday. I\u2019m an undeclared major and I didn\u2019t really know what to sign up for especially because most of the \u201ccool\u201d classes were already filled. I\u2019m taking language, writing seminar, and intro to anthro and intro to comparative lit, all 100 level classes. I\u2019m wondering about other people\u2019s first semester freshman year experiences. Is it normal to take only intro classes at first or should I try to push myself to take a 200 level class in something I have more experience in? Anything helps.",

            "comment": "i wouldn\u2019t really worry about pushing yourself tbh, especially if you\u2019re undecided. i think intro levels are good for your very first semester and it\u2019ll also get some hub units out of the way. imo there\u2019s no rush to take more advanced classes, especially if you don\u2019t know which field you want to pursue. but i\u2019m a rising junior and i still haven\u2019t taken a class above 200 level lol so maybe i\u2019m biased.\n\np.s. if ur taking intro to anthro with prof parla i\u2019ll be in that class too! :)",

            "comment": "Freshman year is the perfect time to explore topics you wouldn't otherwise try out!! I came in undeclared too. Are you leaning toward anything, deciding between two, or have no idea? My only advise is to take classes for a reason. Your language and writing classes are required, perfect choice. For anthro and lit, are those things that interest you? Are those things you might eventually major in? You have plenty of time to try things out and start fresh in new fields. You don't need to major in something you \"have experience in,\" college is the time to get the experience!\n\nNot taking a 200 level class is perfectly normal and there is no need to force yourself to take one if you aren't interested in it. Overall, the 100 is for freshmen, 200 sophomores, etc etc is completely false... All that matters are the prereqs. I took a 400 level as a sophomore and am taking a 100 as a senior now. It is sooooo flexible!\n\nJust spend your freshman year making progress toward a degree, whether than means exploring new things or going in depth into a specific field or just completing HUB requirements. Hope this helps!!",

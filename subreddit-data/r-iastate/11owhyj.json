    "postText": "There's the university undergrad ceremony and then there's my major convocation. Is the one I attend the ceremony and I ignore the convocation? The convocation asks for guests but the ceremony does not.\n\nAlso is the gown size just how tall you are and should I go less more more for the size?",

I decided to do convocation since it was much shorter, mine was about 45 minutes where as the big commencement can last 2-3 hours. You do only get a diploma book cover thing at commencement and not convocation but I didn\u2019t mind bc Im framing my diploma.\n\nAnd for the gown I just ordered one on amazon, much cheaper.",

Black is what you'll want, but you'll also need a tassel that coordinates with your college (each college within ISU is a different color).\n\nIf you decide to just attend the convocation, you might check if you need the gown.  Some colleges might not require it.",

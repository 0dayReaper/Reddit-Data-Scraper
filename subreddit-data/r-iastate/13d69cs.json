    "postText": "Anyone know if ISU sell their rolling chairs they supply for classrooms? I'm asking cause they must have extras somewhere in case some break. Hoping they may give a discount since I'm a student. I'm also aware of ISU surplus but I've never seen anything good there. \n\nIf there's no luck, anyone have some banger desk chair suggestions that are not more than $100?",

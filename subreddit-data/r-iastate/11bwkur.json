But I'm not sure what the differences are, like if one looks better on job applications or if one is better for grad school. I also want my credits to transfer and knock some time off my degree \n\nI found an old post that talks about the differences, but it's 6 years old so it might not be as relevant.\n\nTldr: which one does an associates transfer better for and which is better go to",

If you are interested in programming with physical devices and digital logic SE would be better if you want a broad experience within programming. Also classes in Software Architecture, Design and testing are specific to SE. Also with SE there\u2019s a lot of flexibility in the kind of classes you can take since you can take a CPRE class or Coms class. This is helpful because for some the harder classes past coms 227/228 have professors who make their classes difficult but do not have the ability to teach compared to higher level CPRE classes where the professors are better at teaching complex material. However I would suggest majoring in CS if you are interested in being in a graduate program or doing research.",

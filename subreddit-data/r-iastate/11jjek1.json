Last I checked, the regular donation compensation is $20 for the first donation of the week, then $50 or $70 for the next. you can donate up to twice in a week (and you probably should to make the best money), but you have to have a rest day between your donation days. Each session is like an hour to an hour and a half depending on how busy it is and how much you weigh (it determines how much plasma you can donate), so you can definitely make a good $/hr \"wage\" by doing it.",

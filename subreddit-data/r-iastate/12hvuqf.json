    "postText": "Hi, so it\u2019s looking like I\u2019ll have to take ME 345 (Dynamics), ABE 378/L (Fluids), EM 324 (mechanics of materials), CE 306, and an SSH elective next semester. I\u2019m a civil engineer and have a co-op this semester, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m taking 324 and 378 a semester late.\n\nI did pass statics with a C, but I do feel that I understood the concepts. If it comes down to it, I will drop 306 or the SSH elective but it\u2019s a language elective which I\u2019m native in, so I\u2019m not to worried about it. I\u2019ll be an RA for the dorms, so that\u2019ll be my form of employment.  \n\nIs this biting off more than I can chew? Has anyone done something similar to this? Thanks!",

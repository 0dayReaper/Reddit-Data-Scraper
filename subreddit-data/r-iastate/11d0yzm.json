Any idea how is the exam conducted?",

You might be able to take it fully online with the option of an approved online proctor.\n\nThese type of questions are best asked to the respective departments. I would email them to make sure.",

I ended with a B- but I had a four week overlap with Calc 2 also. It's definitely doable here at ISU.",

    "postText": "Their first assignment to us is to make a simple HTML page. At one point they asked us to write this:\n\n        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n        &lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n        &lt;head&gt;\n            &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\n            &lt;meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\"&gt;\n            &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"&gt;\n            &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;/head&gt;\n        &lt;body&gt;\n    \n            &lt;h1&gt;Hello World !&lt;/h1&gt;\n    \n            &lt;h2&gt;This is a Header h2 .&lt;/h2&gt;\n        \n            &lt;h3&gt;This is a Header h3 .&lt;/h3&gt;\n        \n            &lt;h4&gt;This is a Header h4 .&lt;/h4&gt;\n        \n            &lt;p&gt;The Next is a List UL&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;ul&gt;\n                &lt;p&gt;This is a List of things :&lt;/p&gt;\n                &lt;li&gt;Thing number 1.&lt;/li&gt;\n                &lt;li&gt;Thing number 2.&lt;/li&gt;\n                &lt;li&gt;Thing number 3.&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;/ul&gt;\n        &lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;\n\nThey put a &lt;p&gt; tag directly inside of a &lt;ul&gt; tag, so they're instructing us to write invalid HTML. If they can't do basic fact-checking so early on, how can I trust what this class has to say? Is this class worth taking?",

Assuming the class hasn't changed since 2019.",

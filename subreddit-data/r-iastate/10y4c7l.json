I stopped by with some friends who also like chess and played a few games and chatted. He wears silly hats and plays music to get attention of kids so they play games with him. It's just something for him to do.",

I was a little out of practice, and he kicked my ass. Thoroughly. Multiple times. He explained to me simply where I went wrong. He genuinely loves the game and wants to pass his knowledge and love for it to others. He\u2019d probably be rated pretty well on chess.com if he used it.",

His name is David, he used to live out in California but moved back here to take care of his mom before she passed. I don\u2019t remember what his job was but his other hobbies include photography and painting, he even gave me a signed copy of one of his works. He studies chess most of the time and he can replay famous chess games with you and help you figure out the strategies used by the winning player. The music he plays are all mixtapes he burned to CDs himself and he just tried to make people happy. He\u2019s a great guy and deserves a good chat if you ever can.",

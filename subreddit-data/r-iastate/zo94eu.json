    "postText": "Hi guys, I\u2019m attending this Spring semester and i\u2019ll be living in Freddy Court in a 4 bedroom private. I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice coming into Iowa State regarding literally anything, Cyride, best places to eat, the nightlife, how to join study groups, where to get a job, freddy court, things I should bring during move in, where to study, etc. Literally anything you wish you would have know before coming in. I\u2019ve been pretty nervous about making friends, since I heard that Freddy court is not very social. Also I\u2019m not 100% sure how to use Cyride, I did download the MyState app though. I do have a car but I\u2019m also not sure where I would park if I drove it to classes. Please help (:",

            "comment": "This may just have been me being stupid as a freshman, but you can use Google and Apple Maps set to public transit to plan CyRide bus rides, and I figured that out Sophmore year and it\u2019s been a game changer ever since. If you wanna eat out I would suggest Care Baudelaire, Thai Kitchen, Wok and Roll, and Taste Place. I know a lot of people study in the library, but, especially if your an engineering major, Howe and the TLA in Coover are also good places to study. Hopefully you have fun and any of this was helpful!",

            "comment": "Welcome! I can definitely tell you everything you need to know about CyRide. I'm an ISU graduate and have lived in Ames for about 10 years now and worked at CyRide for 8. \n ---\n**CyRide -** Can be intimidating at first, but once you figure it out it's pretty easy. The apps are useful, but I would recommend taking the time to read our printed bus schedule, because that is what we go by. Sometimes the apps and google transit get very confused whenever we go on break schedule so they might tell you a bus will be there when it isn't running. \n\nFor now, I would start by going to the CyRide website and look at the \"maps\" and \"schedules\" tab. You'll be riding Cardinal if you live in Freddy, and if you're planning on using the system for anything else besides class (such as grocery shopping,) you'll want to figure out routes that will also get you there.\n\n[This is our system map](https://www.cyride.com/Home/ShowDocument?id=9463). It seems like a lot at first, but if it's overwhelming just focus on one route and figure out where it goes. \n\n[This is what a timetable looks like](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule/weekdays/21-cardinal). I selected #21 Cardinal since that is what you'll be riding. Those times in there are called \"timepoints.\" The bus will not leave those stops before the scheduled times. When you look at the [cardinal route map](https://www.cyride.com/home/showpublisheddocument/9991/637401732726630000), any of the square box stops are timepoints. \n\nOnce you get here, there are schedules in the buses - the first time you ride I would grab one and read the information in it.\n\nThe last information I'll leave you with is that you will need your student ID to ride most of the buses. Just show it to the driver, you don't need to scan it or anything. For any route that starts with a \"20\" (21 cardinal, 23 orange, 25 gold,) those are free buses and you don't need to show your ID. Every other bus you will (1 Red, 2 Green, 3 Blue, etc.)\n\n---\n\n**As a transfer student** - Not sure if you're coming from another university or if you're coming from a community college. I transferred from a community college and got my ass handed to me when I came here, and it took a lot of adjustment to orientate myself to the new standards. You will need to go to class and study in order to be successful, especially if you're doing anything in STEM. I used the private desks on floors 2 and 3 on the west side of parks library - I needed the peace and quiet in order to focus. I also made friends with some of my classmates and would work on stuff together - that seemed like it was the easiest way to form a \"study group.\" Group chats and discord channels are especially helpful with this if you're not able to meet up.\n\n---\n\n**Nightlife** - Welch Ave is generally going to be where all of the action is. All the \"bar\" bars are 21+, so if you're not old enough yet you'll have to wait. If partying is your scene, make some friends so you can attend some social night events. I can't tell you much about fraternities or sororities because that was not my cup of tea, but if that's something you're interested in it's a great way to make really good connections.\n\n---\n\n**Best places to eat** - I'm boring, but I really love Macubana on Welch. They serve some really good Cubanos, Burgers, and Mac and Cheese. I don't even want to know the amount of money I've spent there. I also really like 1+1 Chinese over on West street, along with West Street Deli. If you like Mexican food, El Azteca is my favorite for that and it's up in North Ames, along with Brick City Grill for American.\n\n---\n\n**Things to bring** - This advice is age-old, but buy a plunger before you need a plunger. Trust me. Other things that I didn't think about when moving in was a vacuum, broom, bath towels, kitchen towels, extra blankets. Someone should have kitchen knives but if they don't you'll want a set. I would communicate with your roommates because you won't want to buy duplicates of things if it can be shared.\n\n---\n\n**Jobs** - Almost everyone is hiring, so it shouldn't be too difficult getting a job. I would recommend starting with something at Iowa State first because they work around your schedule a lot easier than others. Otherwise there's always CyRide, but honestly we're getting to the point where we're almost hired up and aren't taking as many of the low-hour applicants. If that's something you are interested in in the future, you can always reach out to me on here and I can walk you through that process.\n\n\nHopefully this is some good starter information!",

There's a place right next to Dominos called India Palace that is also really good (especially if you really enjoy spicy indian food like me).

            "comment": "First of all, welcome to ISU! \n\nFor CyRide, the ones that say \u201cfree circulator\u201d which are 21, 23, and 25, you can just walk on. Any other bus you\u2019ll just need to hold up your ISU ID so the driver can see it. I highly recommend taking CyRide or walking anywhere on campus, don\u2019t drive. It\u2019s too congested, nowhere to park. And even if you do find somewhere to park, it\u2019s expensive to pay for. \n\nI believe in freddy court you\u2019ll have to pay for a parking pass to park your car outside your apartment. Not 100% sure on that though. \n\nWill you have a campus meal plan? I don\u2019t think you HAVE to have one in Freddy (you do in the dorms). If you have a campus meal plan, you can eat at the dining centers on campus. The one up in Freddy is called Hawthorn. I guess you can still eat at the dining centers without a meal plan, but it\u2019s expensive so I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. I\u2019d recommend cooking your own food if you have the time and ability. \n\nIn Ames there\u2019s lots of places to go eat or to pick up food from. There\u2019s some on the south side of Lincoln Way, which is called \u201ccampus town\u201d, some on Duff Ave, and some downtown on Main Street. Most of those probably aren\u2019t walkable from Freddy. \n\nPlaces to study: there\u2019s the library, of course. You can pick a random seat or you can reserve a private study room. You can also go into most buildings and if there\u2019s not class going on you can use lecture rooms/halls. I think most buildings are open until 10 pm or so. \n\nFor getting a job: you can check the student job board on AccessPlus or just check out the stores &amp; restaurants around town. Pretty much everywhere is hiring. \n\nNightlife is mostly all the bars on Welch Ave (Campustown area). There are some bars on Main St, but those are less of the college bar type scene. \n\nFor what you should bring during move in: I can\u2019t think of anything special other than your own stuff! I don\u2019t recommend running to target or Walmart the day of move in, it\u2019ll be crazy packed with other students who forgot little things (like command hooks, extension cords, etc). If you can make it a few days without running to the store, I\u2019d try to wait to avoid the craziness. \n\nHope this helps!",

Friendships will form naturally which can form study groups, you can also just ask. Overall it's pretty chill, nothing to stress too much about.\n\nTons of study spots all over campus, there are so many buildings it's hard to even pick a few - check out the library, Howe hall, Coover hall, memorial union. My favorite is the student innovation building - it just feels like a place where you can do your best work, and there's a cafe on the top floor. \n\nCyRide and MyState are pretty simple. Usually have to have your ID ready unless on Gold route I think, that's what I take. I think there are multiple bus routes, and a specific Freddy route to take you to and from campus and within the freddy complex. Seems obvious, but south goes to campus and north goes to you (freddy). As far as the bus stops - one side of the street will always be north and one side will always be south, don't forget that. Google (walking) can get you precisely anywhere on campus.\n\nMy fav spots to eat are The Cafe, Provisions, Taza Mediterranean (#4 is so good), CFA, Five guys, Thai Kitchen, Wasabi. \n\nFor work, that's on you. Not sure how much experience you have, but check the research park for student jobs. They pay very well. Otherwise you can probably find something on campus.\n\nWelcome and good luck!",

Otherwise, you will be walking 15+ minutes to get to your class. The cyride has a pull cord by the windows that request the bus driver to stop at the next stop. This is not normally required, but if nobody is at the bus stop and there is no request, they will drive past it.\n\nThe best chance of making friends is through your classes imo.",

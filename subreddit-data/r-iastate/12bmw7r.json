Coms 321 I don\u2019t remember the workload being as bad, but it\u2019s where u learn assembly and those assignments are the worst. COMS 363 is prob the easiest course you have listed still some work required tho, is easy if you are familiar with SQL. SE 309 can be a fun class if you have a good group, but will be the worst class ever if you have a bad group, this class is also very time consuming. I took COMS 230, and that class is notoriously hard but not as much busy work, I imagine CPRE 310 is similar.",

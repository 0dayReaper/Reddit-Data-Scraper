Can't imagine they would offer free developing in an ISU darkroom either. It's just so expensive and rare",

The course is open to everyone, but you don't even need a developing room to process film. Personally, I just use my bathroom; all one needs is a dark room/film changing bag, a developing tank, and devloping chemicals. Once the negatives are processed just digitally enlarge them, it's much easier than dealing with photo paper.",

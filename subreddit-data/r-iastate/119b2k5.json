I, a 25 year old nontrad, got roomed with a *freshman*. When he left for another university, I picked up my pal Julie from Freddy Court. \n\nSide note, one of my neighbors at the time was employed by the university, not a student. \n\nPoint is, *one* resident needs to be affiliated with the university. \n\nThere are decent off campus options, but you could do worse than SUV. Laundry sucks, though, especially when you live in 62.\ud83d\ude05",

But also, if your partner graduates in a spring semester, they can extend their contract to stay for the summer as well, if you end up liking the place. (Not sure if their scholarship would cover it at that point though)\n\nI've lived in Schilletter for three years, and it's... okay. It has its pros and cons. I can write up more details about it if you want?",

Schilletter Village is slightly more expensive at $6305. Break UV's rate down to 9 months (because you have to pay extra for the summer contract) and it works out to $690/mo plus gas, which... suddenly is much less competitive for tiny two bedroom apartments.",

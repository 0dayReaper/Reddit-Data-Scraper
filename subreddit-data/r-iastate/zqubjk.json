Does the math department have different requirement to pass the class. \n\nAlso should I retake the class or move on continue with my degree, save my retake credits and potentially retake in the future if I need a GPA boost. \n\nAppreciate the advice!",

I\u2019d ask someone else in your major or maybe your advisor, any friends in years above you, etc.",

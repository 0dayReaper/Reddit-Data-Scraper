I took Psychology of Women in hopes to see some brain functions and what different parts of the brain are used and how that part of the brain affects women in their actions compared to men and what parts are generally active in men's brain. Turns out it was a more political class about women in society and almost no actual psychology involved. The description says it would go over women's psychological development and behavior and it didn't. It was all about the cultural issues.\n\nNot the \"psychology\" class I wanted to end my college life on.",

            "comment": "I can label MIS 340 as the most disappointing class I took when I was a student, though most MIS classes I took are close runners up. The subject of MIS 340 was supposed to be on \u201cProject Management.\u201d \n\n* Scheduled class time was wasted with the professor constantly storytelling, often without regard to relevance. (Yes, attendance was mandatory.) \n* The objective for the semester project was unclear at first, but I eventually found out that all our group needed to do was piss around with a Jira board and hack together a presentation on it. \n* The professor provided question banks to study for exams, turning them into nothing more than hoop-jumps.\n\nWhile MIS 340 was my most disappointing class, after almost a year of experience in the workforce post-graduation, I can acknowledge how little I learned from the MIS curriculum alone. Most of the MIS classes were simply too generic to teach any useful skills. For example, as far as I was aware, there were no MIS classes on configuring Microsoft Azure AD and Endpoint, administration of Oracle NetSuite, or simply educating less computer-savvy employees and helping them put out fires, just to name a few of my biggest responsibilities today. \n\nEven if there were classes on those subjects, I wouldn\u2019t have known if I needed to take them. MIS is an extremely broad major that can take you many different directions, so the generic content of the classes is not completely unjustifiable. However, as it pertains to my current job, I honestly think I learned a lot more useful skills through my cybersecurity minor, my on-campus job at one of the departmental IT helpdesks, and personal interest in various subjects. \n\nFor these reasons, time-wasting aside, I don\u2019t place blame entirely on the professor or the MIS curriculum. Your university experience is what you make of it. The more you learn now, the better off you will be in your future profession.",

What we got was an exercise in tedium and labs that took 8 or 10 hours past the alloted 2 each week.\n\nThe robots are utter trash and can't even drive in a straight line with help. We were expected to work fucking magic with the worst sensors I've ever seen. I wanted so much more from the class. But it's mostly just about register machines rather than the robots. We were not required to take any sort of stats or data science prior to this but damn did we need it.\n\nJones was a not insignificant source of problems as well.

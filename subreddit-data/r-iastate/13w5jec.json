I took COM S 309, CPRE 288, and EE 230 together last semester and was busy, but it was very doable. 309 is easy if you find a good group, so be on the class discord early looking for other people wanting to get on it. 288 is VERY lab heavy, I finished maybe 3 of them in the actual lab period, but they\u2019re easy to get 100% on. 230 was probably the hardest class I\u2019ve taken so far, but I didn\u2019t do too hot in EE 201 either.",

When I took 310 we had 6 homework, some quizzes, and 3 exams so it's not much. I had Kamal for 310 and he was a good prof, it's too bad he's no longer with us.",

I guess it\u2019s really a question of taking 309 with 288 or 381. I\u2019d really like to have a project to show employers tho, but I also have heard from many people that E E 230 is very difficult",

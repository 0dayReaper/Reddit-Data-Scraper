You give up some rights for security, because there is no greater loss of freedom than dying or having some dipshit cause the death of family members because they cant think of themselves in context of everyone in the room they are in.\n\nFucking selfish, democrats arent perfect and a two party system sucks but i cant really add up the numbers to make them even close to the lack of patriotism or dishonorable acts that the Republicans have done. I dont care, we shouldnt have to act like we need to walk on eggshells on this issue just like we shouldnt have to act like people who fly the confederate flag and dont tread on me stickers dont look like traitorous assholes.\n\nAs for \"politicizing\", Im on the side of the CDC. I agree with 95% of doctors on the vaccine, and probably even more on masks. I hate wearing them, but I will if its what i need to do to protect myself and my fellow countryman. \n\nRepublicans project that anyone who disagrees with them are politicizing this. Everyone else is following science. Republicans are following their own political smut.",

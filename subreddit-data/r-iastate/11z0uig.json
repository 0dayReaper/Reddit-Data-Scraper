    "postText": "I am choosing between the university village and Friley, which is a better choice? Price wise the university village is cheaper, But Friley is also good, Which is closed to engineering hall, I can take classes easily. and it is near the gym, the price of the Friley is twice as the SUV for single person room. I have struggle to choose between these two. Can you please give me some advice to where should I choose?",

The overall space compared to a dorm was nice, and it's the cheapest apartment you'll find in Ames. The front porch area and backstep were quite nice to have, as I enjoyed grilling and growing plants. \n\nHowever, the place also showed its age. The seals of the doors were in bad shape, my water heater kicked the bucket (but was replaced quickly), and outlets were scarce in some rooms. Also the thermostat was downstairs so the upstairs temperature was usually hotter or colder than you wanted.\n\nYoull also be a but farther from campus but buses run fairly often and its not a terrible walk.\n\nOverall id say you get what you pay for and its a solid transition from dorm living to apartment life.",

It's nice to have a bathroom and kitchen you don't have to share with a ton of people.  Also, a meal plan is not required at UV. You will need a meal plan if you live at Friley. The only downside is it needs to be updated and the walls are thin. However, I would 100% choose UV over a dorm room. It's nice to have your own space :)",

For some reason my room is also much smaller than my roommates, which is frustrating. My room is probably about 9\u2019x9\u2019. Other than that, I really like it here and the price is right.",

There are some single units, but I just stay in a pets apartment and pay the whole portion myself, which is still cheaper than other apartments. If you live in a pets apartment they can't randomly assign you a roomate. It's pretty big for just one person, and yeah it's a little old but definitely worth it.",

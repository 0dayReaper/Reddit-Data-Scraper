She's going to give you the regular manager spiel about attendance policy and those points will stick around for a hot minute, but you'll be fine.\n\nAs others have said, the points system is largely ignored at this time because of demand for employees, but you *can and will* get fired if you get complacent. Your best ally is, if you're gonna miss, be honest, sack up and communicate. Transparency will save you.",

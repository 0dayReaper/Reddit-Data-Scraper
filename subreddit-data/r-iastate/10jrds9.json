Mix em all together with some ketchup and you could get 3 days off food for like $10.\nSame with chili. 2lbs beef, some tomatoes, black beans and onions and you've got 20 meals straight of semi healthy, semi tasty food for $1/each. \n\nCooking in bulk keeps time and cleanup down too.",

You need to think about nutrient dense foods, and what meals you plan on making. Going to the groccery store with a list of ingredients and an idea of what type of food and meals you would like to make is the biggest step.\n\nFrom there, planning out your meals ahead of time, tuesday I'll roast a chicken and eat it with a salad and bread for dinner. Wednesdays i'll make leftovers from chicken into a chicken noodle soup, now i have soup for the week. ect ect. \n\nIt all stems from a bank of techniques and reciepes you have in your mind. Cooking is not an over night process, it takes years to get good at planning and cooking your meals out. The better you are the more efficent you are at it, the more you can buy the same ingredients but also make different types/flavors of meals from the same said ingredients it all comes from techniques and reciepes we already know. \n\nWHen it comes to time and cleaning, CLEAN while you COOK. I laid a piece of chicken down on the pan, i'm going to wash the stuff i used to prep it. Cut and prep all your raw ingredients before the heat even gets turned on on the stove. Clean while you are waiting for said food to cook. By the time you sit down to eat, your kitchen should already be clean. \n\nIt is a process and it takes time. Alidis' is the cheapest way to go in terms of groceries in Ames. It's expensive else where. I make gourmet meals that are restaurant quality, yet i only spend about 50 dollars a week on grocceries and i dont eat out.",

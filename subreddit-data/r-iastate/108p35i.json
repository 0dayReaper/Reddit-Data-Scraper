The \"alternative energy\" class might be a little thermodynamics heavy for you, but there is a wind energy class (I signed up for it but it got cancelled due to lack of interest). There is a \"technology, globalization, culture\" class that is somewhat energy focused, easy, and few pre reqs that would probably work too.",

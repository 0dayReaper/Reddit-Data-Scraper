I also go over to [Spinning Wheels Skating](https://goo.gl/maps/oyMpA5iHQLpWVhNT9?coh=178571&amp;entry=tt) in Ogden pretty much every week to roller skate.  \n\nI'm pretty good at roller skating (you might see me practicing outside), and I can teach how to do the cool rollerskate dance stuff.  DM me if you're interested.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/enjdaw3jxz1b1.jpg?width=1941&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f422718ca28fea1819246b574871e42399926d16",

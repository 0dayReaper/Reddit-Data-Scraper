Just keep your door open, go to the social events they have for freshman, and you\u2019ll make friends regardless",

Because Martin is suites the people keep to themselves and don\u2019t really talk amongst other suites. I\u2019d say Martin bc bathrooms are nice to have private but Friley bc the experience of meeting people that way is classic. Cant go wrong either way.",

It's a little weird the first week, but you'll get used to the communal bathroom fast. The non-communal bathroom really is the biggest luxury in Martin. If it is a deal-breaker, go for Martin... But I'd recommend Friley.",

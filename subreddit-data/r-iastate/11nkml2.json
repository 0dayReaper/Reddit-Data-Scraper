    "postText": "Hello \ud83d\udc4b! I am an international student got an PhD offer from CBE at ISU. I liked a few of the professors and their works align with my interests. Is there any CBE grad students (well, anyone can help!) who can help me with my queries?\n\n1. I think it's important to know who are the primary employers of isu grad students. Would love to learn where most of them are going for job. (This question is to finalize my decision as I have another phd offer as well) \n\n2. (This one's for cbe grad if any) If I want to explore certain niches in different lab other than my primary one, can I do that? \n\n2. Which housings are usually occupied by grad students? How would you rate those in terms of cost, distance, community?\n\n3. How about the living cost right now. I believe the cost has been rising steadily and would love to know how much someone with a 33k funding (have health insurance separately covered) can save a month?\n\nThanks in advance!!!",

            "comment": "1) grad students and undergrads have 3 career fairs a year, the career fairs are I believe one of the biggest in the nation. Anywhere you want to work at would probably be there, for CBE I would guess there would especially be a lot of employees for agricultural products like pesticides but also a lot of plastic plants and things like that. You name it you\u2019ll find employers.\n\n2) sorry I\u2019m not in this program\n\n3) for grad students most will either split apartments off campus, or for school run housing a lot live in University Village. I\u2019ll be honest they\u2019re not nice but they do have air conditioning and are perfectly livable. That\u2019s like 3000 per year if you split a townhouse with someone, and you don\u2019t have to pay utilities or internet.\n\n4) I can\u2019t estimate but few places are cheaper than Iowa so you\u2019ll probably have an easier time saving here than almost any other university\n\nHope that helps! If you\u2019ve got any other questions reply or DM I can try and help",

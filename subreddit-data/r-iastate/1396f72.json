School is M-F 8-5, when you're not in class you're finding somewhere on campus to read, work through notes, study. \nObviously you need to work outside that too as needed, but you'll be much more organized and prepared for the weekends.\nAnd also, have fun, meet people, find a club or two.",

Legit, u can knock out some of ur required classes and decrease the amount of classes u have to take, frees up time for \u2018for fun\u2019 classes\n\nStudy abroad center is in the 2nd floor and ask for Jenny Macken. She\u2019s amazing and even if ur stuff gets canceled for various reasons that lady will get u on a trip one way or another\n\nAlso clubs rock",

            "comment": "Sleep is important.\n\nWhile it is okay to sacrifice it for brief periods of time, such as studying for an exam, do not make a habit of it. Do your best to go to bed on time every or almost every night.\n\nI did not my first two years and paid for it dearly. Mental health below zero. This year I've been happier than ever, and that has meant skipping some classes because I needed my sleep. Yes, my grades have suffered somewhat, but at the end of the day, as long as you understand the material at the end, a few decimal places off of a number that only really matters for your first job is nothing compared to being able to smile each and every day.\n\nBasically, put your health above your grades.\n\nYou're likely about to embark on the most difficult think you've ever done (might not be true for you but it is for a lot of people). If you can't do as well as you want to, don't attack yourself over it. Try not to succumb to those downward spirals. This means getting enough sleep, having a good support system (friends, family, hobbies, maybe a therapist, maybe rapport with the professors to ask for the occasional extension), and good googling skills. I can't speak for genetics, but at least in engineering, there's almost always a guy on YouTube who explains stuff better than your professor could dream of.\n\nThe above might seem like an over reaction, but I came here during Covid. Roommate bailed, too late to cancel housing and go home, so I was stuck by myself in a room for nearly a year, I knew nobody, I was discouraged from meeting people because of the pandemic, my sleep drifted because almost everything I had to do was asynchronous, I got caught in procrastination, and it. Was. Not. Fun.\n\nI like many others here was one of the smartest people in their high school, and suddenly going from unique to one amongst a sea of similar people, suddenly unable to excel when your entire life you've been the one who excels can be jarring under the best of circumstances. With Covid and isolation and lack of sleep and nobody to turn to, it hit like a freight train and didn't let up for months. Don't be like me, and if you do turn out like me, know that there are more people to turn to than you think there are.\n\nAlso, don't cheat. If you do decide to look up the answers, don't just copy them down, do the work yourself until you get those answers. It may seem like a good way out in the short term if you don't get caught, but long term you NEED to understand the material, especially the stuff from your first year or two of school. Don't Chegg it, don't ChatGPT it, don't just blindly plug stuff into online calculators, etc.",

If you show them that you\u2019re actually interested in learning, they can be very helpful. It\u2019s also nice just to stop by during the first week or two and introduce yourself.  \nAlso, the university offers free or very inexpensive tutoring and extra classes (can\u2019t remember what they\u2019re called right now).

            "comment": "This is about to turn into a rant, but I\u2019m still alive and kicking. Going down like a sinking ship. I decided not to open today and work in this heat to see no business. The campus is largely abandoned. There is nobody walking about and my business is now a tiny fraction of what is normal. Iowa State said they will fill any of our spots with other carts if we aren\u2019t going to be back this fall. We can\u2019t give up our spots, but we can\u2019t afford to operate them with no business. Macubana is hurting badly and I heard through my ice guy today that Carlos Quesadillas might have to close their store at the mall. For the comments that say I show up just when I want to, that\u2019s not really true. I try to be there as much as possible. Rain and wind are my two biggest enemies and Iowa gets a lot of it. My bread is fresh daily but I have to order it the day before. If it was supposed to rain and doesn\u2019t, I have no bread to open. I\u2019ve taken a lot of chances on rain and end up throwing hundreds of dollars in bread away every week. We seem to get a lot of rain right in the middle of the day sometimes, too. If I can\u2019t get open by noon on campus, there\u2019s not much point and towing the cart in the rain makes a mess of it. Then of course there is winter. I don\u2019t think I need to explain much there. I wasn\u2019t there as consistently as I should have been last fall. I was dealing with some extremely painful back issues, mostly attributed to that massive cooler of beverages I had. Got rid of that and I\u2019ve never felt better. As far as Welch Ave is concerned, yeah, I do that when I feel like it. Dealing with drunk students and all the drama that comes with it is not how I like to spend my weekends after a full work week on campus. So if you want to see me on Welch more, certain people ought to behave themselves a little better. I\u2019ve been assaulted, stolen from, verbally abused, had property damaged, had some douche peeing on the side of the cart last fall, bottles thrown at me from passing cars, fights in front of the cart... etc etc. I don\u2019t need to deal with that. This is my business and I put my heart and soul into a great product for the students to enjoy, and I don\u2019t feel I deserve to have to deal with the Welch crowd unless it\u2019s a lucrative night. Right now? Can\u2019t be there anyway. Construction for one, and the city pulled all the permits back in April because of Covid. This brings me to the people that call me rude. I know I can be sometimes. You have no idea the stress I\u2019m under and the things I have to deal with, or hard and fast I have to keep the pace to make this even halfway timely for my customers. I don\u2019t mean to be rude. I don\u2019t want to be rude and that\u2019s not my intention. You must understand that people ask the same questions multiple times per day and most of those questions can be answered if you just look at my sign. The same 4 questions are often asked. What do you sell? How much is it? What comes on it? Do you take credit cards? Then both on the sign and on the daytime order forms, there is an explanation on what giardiniera is. Guess what the 5th most common question is? Or I say \u201cI\u2019ll be right with you\u201d in a cheerful voice and am at a crucial point in the 6 sandwiches I\u2019m making at a time and people won\u2019t wait and they demand to be taken care of right now. Or instead of just waiting where they\u2019re supposed to at the head of the line, they wander off. Or they ask where they should put their ticket and I say \u201cjust hang on to it and wait right there, I\u2019ll be with you in a moment\u201d, and they set their ticket on the table and walk away. Next thing you know, I\u2019m chasing it in the wind. Then a stack of tickets starts to form as more people do the same. Then I have to get everyone back over to the cart and get them rang up. That takes so much more time and slows down the process. Of course there are the ones who have been waiting in line and wait until it\u2019s actually time to pay to start digging through their backpack for their payment. Or the people who hand me a wad of money. C\u2019mon. Grow up. That\u2019s no way to hand anyone cash. Or the people who fold the order forms up, or the ones who can\u2019t follow the instructions right on the order form to circle their choices. Not check marks, stars, underlines, etc. There\u2019s a reason for all of this and it\u2019s to get people through the line as fast as possible, to get the best quality food, and the least amount of confusion and mistakes on my part. On a super busy day, I\u2019m trying to pump out 120+ cheesesteaks in about 3.5 hours. 6 at a time, as fast as I can go, no breaks to even take a sip of water usually. BY MYSELF. My line never quits. So, get with the system so everyone can get their food faster. I take 6 orders, I start 6 sandwiches, I take 6 more orders, finish the first 6, start the next 6, and repeat. I\u2019m actually a pretty nice guy when it\u2019s all going well. I like to get to know my customers, I try to remember their usual orders, and I\u2019ll chat with anyone if I\u2019m not insanely busy. I have a lot of regulars that I have gotten to know very well. Rant over. Hopefully will be back tomorrow. Next week for sure. It will be cooler next week. And please, remember to support these carts and trucks, NOT THE ISU DINING FOODTRUCKS, and other small businesses about town. We need it desperately. So, thank you to those that do support my business and the business of guys like Carlos of Carlos Quesadillas and Herbert of Macubana. We\u2019re not getting rich off of this, were just trying to make an honest living.",

There are no preservatives or modified starches in it and it doesn\u2019t freeze well either. It will be moldy by day 5. I only use day old bread if I run out of fresh bread and I will tell the customer it will be made on day old bread and they\u2019re usually fine with that.  I will not use 3 day old bread. When I donate it, I almost feel like I\u2019m dumping my trash on to them. But things like expired chips and overrun on veggies going into a school break always get donated. During November, Fareway gives away free turkeys with over $50 in meat orders. That\u2019s where my steak comes from and each year I donate about 15 turkeys to Food at First.",

During these two weeks of classes I\u2019ve already being able to visit each once. After all campus dining will remain no matter what, but there is no certainty with the small businesses on campus.",

Read my rant I just posted and you\u2019ll find some of the reasons why I get that way. Or maybe I\u2019m just a dick? That\u2019s entirely possible, but I can also be super nice and my food is fire.

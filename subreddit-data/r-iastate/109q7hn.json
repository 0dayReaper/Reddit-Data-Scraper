Idk if people like to post complaints more than achievements but im worried.\n\nwith the cost of living increasing by alot but jobs not matching inflation, im worried i might only be able to find $15/hr jobs and be left with crippling debt and a piece of paper saying i graduated. I already know to apply early, bulk up the resume and practice interviewing but I like to think worst case scenario and I'm fucked.\n\njust buying groceries (eggs: $4 for dozen) makes me worried for the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I see the stem majors don't have problems, i'm curious of the social sciences or business ones too if there is anyone else.",

It's going to be because there aren't that many good paying entry level jobs to be had and high competition for the ones that do exist.  \n\nI graduated at the height of a recession and struggled to find a job, ended up finding a job outside of my degree field. Fast forward 10 more years and I'm in a very well paying job with great benefits, although still not in my degree field. \n\nLong story short, the farther you get from graduation, the less importance is placed on your degree. In the corporate world, it really only matters that you have A degree, not really a specific one (obviously this will change depending on the field). Work experience is highly more preferred than a matching degree.",

My biggest advice is to get involved with a club (or something outside of classes) that allows you to practically apply what you do in class.

Congrats you\u2019ve taken the exact same classes as the kid with a 2.9 except he/she spent 30 hours a week demonstrating that they had the chops to do more than learn from a textbook meanwhile you have nothing unique to talk about during interviews. \n\nI was a shitty student in class but my extracurricular experience led to some cool internships which then led to a really great job with pretty solid pay right out of school. \n\nI realize not every situation or major is the same but the biggest takeaway is to do something that sets you apart from the average student and that will do 90% of the work of getting you a decent job. The last 10% comes down to you knowing how to leverage that experience and demonstrating that you can bring something of value to a potential employer.",

I even know one guy who started at 150k for a sales position, but he had some other stuff going on that helped with that. I ended up doing grad engineering work, ended up making around 120k out the gate. \n\nOn the other end, I know two individuals who got biology degrees with middling grades. One got a job for 42k (eventually moved to IT for a &gt;10k+ raise) while another got a job doing hourly non-profit work for about 35k (two years later, upgraded to a similar job paying 50k, then went to grad school). \n\nI don't know exact numbers on their jobs, but I have two other friends who got psych degrees and went into social work in the Des Moines area. My guess is a similar ballpark of 40k based on lifestyle (one lived with parents), although that work is burnout central and now both do other things. \n\nIn terms of non-ISU grads, I also know one teacher who makes in the 45k ballpark, and a nurse who makes a bit more than that (50-60k). The nurse got lucky during Covid and got some travel work to pull 6 figures that year, but now she's back to normal.\n\nHope that helps! For what it's worth, everyone I just mentioned has about the same level of happiness because they're doing stuff they care about and it pays the bills. Several don't use their degrees in the slightest, while some sought out the education to enable their goals (financial or otherwise).",

Really gets your foot in the door with job postings that require 1-2 years minimum experience. It's a big regret of mine that I didn't do research with a professor. \n\nAnother piece of advice is to make use of the Career Services office at ISU. Fantastic resource and their mock interviews probably helped me land the internship I had.\n\nBottom line, there are a lot of opportunities at ISU that will help your career development. One of the benefits of a big school is that there is something for everyone.",

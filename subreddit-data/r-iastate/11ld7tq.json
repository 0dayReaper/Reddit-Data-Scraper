    "postText": "If I want to graduate by Fall 2023, I'd have to take ~8 credit hours divvied up between 3 classes. How challenging are Summer classes, or at least of this load size? Has anyone done it? What are your experiences? Would you (not) recommend it? I'd have to work a minimum of ~30 hours/week while doing so. \n\nI took a winter class before as context and thought it was absolutely horrible, although I attempted to work ~33 hours/week while doing so and was completely unprepared. \n\nMy other choices would be to graduate in Spring, or be done by winter and get a certificate of completion, and would still actually graduate by spring but not have any classes.",

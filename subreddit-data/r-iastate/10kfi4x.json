    "postText": "I recently was pulled over on campus (over winter break) and the cop noted that my car smelled like weed. Long story short, the cops found nothing on me or in my car (I was not smoking and driving or driving while high) but because they smelled the weed they wanted to do a drug test. I was essentially forced to take the drug test which I know will come back as positive since I did hotbox my car over winter break while in IL visiting family (I know it was a stupid thing to do, I should have thought that through more). I was stopped on campus by the ISU PD. I don\u2019t know if it makes a difference but I was not arrested at any point and I was only initially stopped because my exhaust cracked a few months ago and is fairly loud. Will ISU be notified of this and if so, is there a chance they will try to kick me out? I tried looking it up on ISUs website and reading through their code of conduct but didn\u2019t find anything concrete. If you have been in a similar situation any feedback would be much appreciated, thanks!",

He\u2019s not cheap but please give him a call at the very least and talk to him. They had me dead to rights and he got me off the charges completely. No probation, no jail time, no nothing. Bryan is on a different level when it comes to being a lawyer. He dog walked the absolute shit out of the prosecutor going after me and made him look like a fool. He\u2019s not cheap, but I\u2019d rack up the credit card debt again in a heartbeat again if I was ever in the same situation.",

Eubanks, 335 N.W.2d 57, 59,\n(Iowa 1984), our court found the odor of marijuana by itself was adequate probable cause for a warrantless search, stating, \u201cIn addressing the smell of marijuana supporting a vehicle search, our supreme court has held \u201ca trained officer\u2019s detection of a sufficiently distinctive odor, by itself or when accompanied by other facts, may establish probable cause.\u201d \n\nState v. Stewart, No. 17-0705, 2018 WL 2084832, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App. May 2, 2018) (emphasis added).\n In Eubanks, the supreme court determined \u201c[T]he patrolman clearly had sufficient probable cause to search the vehicle and its contents\u201d based on the fact he \u201csmelled the odor of marijuana drifting from the car when he approached defendant, who was seated behind the steering wheel.\u201d 355 N.W.2d at 59; see also \n\nState v. Pickering, No. 16-1272, 2017 WL 1405913, at *1 (Iowa Ct. App. Apr.13, 19, 2017) (\u201cAfter initiating the traffic stop, the deputy detected the smell of marijuana wafting from the vehicle as the driver was exiting the vehicle. This is sufficient to establish probable cause to search further.\u201d); \n\nAs for Iowa state, they are notified about all violent, drug, and vandalism related charges. However, I doubt they will do anything about it since it\u2019s no biggie\n\n\nIf you do consider legal action, submit a \u201cFOIA\u201d request for the bodycam footage and traffic stop information. It will speed up the process.\n\n*I am not a lawyer and do not have the power to give legal advice*",

They took pics and prints, but let me go because they didnt want me to stay in jail over the weekend. I had to meet with someone from ISU and the guy was super cool about it. He basically said it wasnt a big deal and it wouldnt affect my standing at ISU. He said it wouldnt be a big deal if I were to get caught again. It was a huge relief. It might affect financial aid, depending on what you got going on. I was given a deferred judgement since it was my first offence and I had to pay a ~300 dollar fine and was on probation for like 7 or 8 months. My probation officer was very nice and understanding. She said to try to pay off the fine as soon as possible and to not smoke on probation. I was never drug tested during probation, but I would still avoid it. If its your first time getting in trouble in Iowa, you will most likely get a deferred judment, which means that after your probation, your record will be sealed to some degree and you can say that you have not gotten in trouble when you fill out forms asking if youve ever been arrested for xyz. Also, I had a public defender, so If you cant afford a private one, the public ones arent so bad. The only thing im unsure about is that your offense was an OWI, which is different from my case. Best of luck G, if I made it through, im sure you can too.",

Also make damn sure they can't relate this to you! A good lawyer might say they didn't have a fair reason to test you just because of the smell. If they didn't bring a dog out, and your eyes weren't red in the photo it could easily get dropped. I'm just saying don't incriminate yourself.

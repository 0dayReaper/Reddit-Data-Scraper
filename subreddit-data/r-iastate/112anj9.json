    "postText": "I have an appointment with my advisor to change my major from political science to history. I have taken a couple history classes and enjoy them way more than political science, but I have recently heard about the History department facing a significant budget cut. I was wondering if there are any current history majors on here that could tell me just how much these cuts have affected their education.",

As much as I love my former department, if you are interested in a graduate history degree in the state, start to talk to the Iowa History department sooner rather than later. An Iowa State history B.A. won't carry much water very soon.\n\nIf you are just in it for the B.A., there are still excellent people there teaching for now. Take advantage of them while you can.",

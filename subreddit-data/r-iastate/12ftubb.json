    "postText": "My roommate asks ChatGPT weird stuff and I don't know what to do\n\nAt first it was normal. I'd walk by and see fully written discussion posts and solutions to his ECE homework. But about 4 weeks ago, he bought ChatGPT *plus,* and this when things started to get weird...\n\nIt started with fairly... I don't know... innocent things, I guess? He would on occasion ask it if it can keep a secret. Maybe he was using it as a journal that talks back (kinda like the one from harry potter). Anyway, I largely ignored this, I mean he was spending 3-4 hours a day (that I saw) talking to the damn thing but I guess he just needed friends and he doesn't know me like that. It stayed like this for a while. I'd come home to the apartment, he'd be talking to ChatGPT. I'd come out of the shower, ChatGPT. I woke up at 3am to get water once, ChatGPT. Like clockwork. \n\nThat's when the jailbreaking started. \n\nHe came up to me about 2 weeks ago and told me about about this \"DAN\" which *I thought* was a new AI bot. But then he showed me a recipe for methamphetamine that ChatGPT just happened to shit out. I said \"bro, that's fucked up\" and went back to my room. But then he started screaming at it, like it was supposed to do everything he asked. I thought he was playing some video game or something, but nah, it was just him yelling at the AI.\n\nSo, now for the reason I felt the need to post this, and hoping to god he's too busy to see this post. He started asking ChatGPT for really oddly specific things. I walked by his computer and in his chat log I saw something that said \"Molarity of Sulfuric Acid to dissolve pork roast.\" He's vegan. And then I remembered that there was this big blue plastic container delivered to the apartment, that sorta just, disappeared? He's also been acting really weird lately, I'd come home from class and catch him sitting in my room. He usually stayed there for just a few minutes after I settled in, I'd say hi but he just gave me a weird, almost longing stare. He said he was just there to pet my cat... I have a fucking fish. \n\nAnyway, I'm thinking about going to my advisor, but I'm looking for some advice here first. Has anyone had a similar experience?",

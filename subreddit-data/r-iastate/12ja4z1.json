    "postText": "Like title says, I'm a little annoyed because professors won't let me see exams I've taken for their class, even if I go to them during office hours (looking at you MAT E 273). It's frustrating because I'm paying so much money to be here and learn engineering in a place where messing up doesn't risk lives and can't even learn from mistakes, which is one of the best ways to learn anything. I think it's incredibly immoral for any professor to not let you see exams at all and it goes completely against what learning really is. Additionally, I know a common reason is that exams are reused, and my counter to that is that showing exams in person would avoid the exams getting posted online somewhere. What does everyone else think?",

FERPA states that a student's academic records must be available to them upon request. I'm not sure if exams fall under \"academic records\" but definitely speak with the department chair and find out.",

As that is what an exam is, and for a professor to tell you that you may not see what you did wrong is pretty much counterproductive to education.",

I had 273 last semester and he threatened to make the exams much harder and change the basic format from what was outlined in the syllabus because he had a select number of students that would supposedly talk and distract others. Many of my friends have had similar experiences in other years, he\u2019s just a bit of an ass and seems to loathe his students.",

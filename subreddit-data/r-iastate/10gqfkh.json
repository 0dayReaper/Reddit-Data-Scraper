Yes, some songs are hits and misses with the environment, but for the most part I think the songs hype people up. As for the Alma Mater and the fight song... how can you not like them? They are traditions that spur everyone up and unite all fans of the team with their familiarity making everyone feel a sense of solidarity and in a win, pride.",

The under 4 timeout where we play the slowed-down fight song to go with whoever is trundling along on the upper deck with the flag drains energy right at the key point in the game. I\u2019d rather hear juicy wiggle or sandstorm or some other hype song at the under 4, especially if the game is a close one. There\u2019s lots of big moments in basketball where the band playing gets drowned out by the crowd anyway, and using a different song would boost the crowd more.\n\nThey are definitely still key, but moderation is the biggest thing. There\u2019s a balance to be had to create the best atmosphere. Plus, wearing yellow shirts when the theme is whiteout is ridiculous. They should\u2019ve wore white as well with everyone else. Just makes them look like a stain in what otherwise was a fantastic photo of Hilton from Tuesday",

But when Bill Self burns his last timeout in Hilton after Caleb Grill drills a dagger with under 4 minutes left to play the last thing I want to hear is the fucking band playing. Give me something to get hype to and keep the students going!",

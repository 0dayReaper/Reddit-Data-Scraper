In an actual tornado warning, go to an interior room on the lowest level of the building you're in, away from glass and exterior doors.  Do not take tornado selfies.",

We may not know the exact specifics of when the rain will start or what the peak wind gusts will be or where there'll be a tornado touchdown, but we can usually look at forecast data and interpret it to know what the likely effects will be and what our options are for protective actions.\n\nOur National Weather Service partners shoulder a lot of the load for us.  As is typical for this sort of thing, they're holding a briefing call in about half an hour to give all of the emergency managers in their service area their latest analysis on what's coming.  NWS is the most common source that local leaders - whether that's counties, cities, universities, K-12 districts - use when deciding to modify or cancel operations for a severe weather threat.  Can't say enough good things about them.",

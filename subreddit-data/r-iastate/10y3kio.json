            "comment": "I took it last Fall, it is a beast. I got an A- in COMS 311 in Spring 2020, but in COMS 511 I got a D and barely passed. However, I didn't take it as seriously as I should have as I had already secured a job. I wasn't going for a masters and was just taking it because it looked interesting.\n\nI was able to do well in COMS 311 because it involved a lot of programming mixed with proofs. COMS 511 is all rigorous and formal proofs and everything is very abstract. You'll learn about Network Flow algorithms such as Fold-Fulkerson and Edmonds-Karp at a very deep level. You will have to be able to use these and many other algorithm's properties to solve other problems. You will learn about many different problems that are NP-Complete as well as how they were derived from 3SAT or other NP-Complete problems. \n\nIt requires a lot of very deep and complex thought to be able to understand a problem, it's solution, and how that solution mechanism could be used to solve other problems. When I saw questions on homework or exams, I spent most of my time trying to understand what the questions were asking in the first place because of how much intricate language was used. It feels very rewarding when you finally put the pieces together.\n\nDr. Eulenstein is pretty good but I very rarely understood lecture and usually just read the book and slides. If you want to learn about algorithms deeply, it's very interesting!",

I have a few follow up questions. \n\n1) any idea how your classmates did?\n\n2) I feel like anyone who reads slides/textbook outside of class to understand the material is at least taking the class somewhat seriously. What do you think you could've done differently to have done better in the class?\n\n3) do you feel Oliver's expectations were reasonable, or was the class hard because he expected you to do things on a test that you were never even remotely taught and/or didn't have time for?\n\n4) how similar are the tests to the homework?",

On the final exam I studied for days straight to try to keep my grade. I got a 50/100 and my friends both got 54 and 56 but managed Bs. No curve.\n\n2) The problem for me was that when it started with Big O I thought I knew enough. I got (80 - 100) /100 on the homeworks and didn't feel like I needed to study that hard. Big mistake, once it got hard every lecture built off the previous one. Even though I rarely missed lecture, if you don't fully understand what was taught the last lecture, then you will learn nothing from this lecture, and the snowball will begin. I also think they are much more lenient with homework than with exams. Both exams I got about 50/100. I'm about to start a masters with Georgia Tech's OMSCS, they have an algorithms course that seems to be equivalently difficult. I am not worried about going through this material again because if I had given the time and effort needed all throughout the course instead of just the second half I think I could have maintained a B. Also utilize the TAs! I definitely should have done that!\n\n3. I think he did a good job with the course. He told us exactly what concepts would appear on the exam so we knew what to study. It's very difficult to grade proofs, but that was mostly to my advantage. Some of the problems had specific solutions that I didn't know about, so TAs had an easy time grading those proofs. But when I turned in my round-about 3 page proof where I use everything I've ever learned to solve this problem I've never seen before I think they just trusted my answer. Oliver has a very strong accent that can be difficult to understand for a while and his handwriting is not good, but I eventually got through that part. \n\n4. The 2 exams are the same style as the homework. The homework will have 2-3 questions and will take more time to solve usually and require a lot of studying. The exams will have around 7 questions and will have very elegant and clear solutions - as long as you deeply understand the problem. Every exam will have the same problems shown in lecture, however with some tiny twist very deep in the problem. Solving the problems should be very easy if everything about the algorithm is deeply understood, else it will seem impossible to solve and you probably won't even know what the question is asking. If you follow him in lecture you should do well on the exams.",

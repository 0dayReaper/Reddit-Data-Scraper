    "postText": "Any one who has previously taken this course, how difficult was it? \n\nAnd how strict is Prof Yan-Bin Jia in grades and homework assignments? Is it a theory course or a programming-heavy one? Which programming language does Prof Jia use? \n\n(I really like the course structure and want to pursue a research project on AI. But I do not want to end up getting a bad grade.)",

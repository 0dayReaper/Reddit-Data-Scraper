Can anyone who\u2019s lived or know about it tell me what it was like? I\u2019m pretty outgoing and I want have a \u201ctraditional freshman experience\u201d. How much does being in singles affect that?",

It's OK if you just want to live alone and not have to deal with roommates, but it is a bit far away from the main campus compared to other dorms. If I'm going to be honest, it's not known for being socially active like it used to to be decades ago from what I've heard. There is definitely a sort of bond you form with familiar faces there as a group living on an isolated campus property but no one is going out of their way to become friends with each other like the on campus dorms.\nAs for the building itself, it has everything you could need. A gym, study space, student convenient store, pool tables, and a theater as well as outdoor sports facilities. I'm not sure if Storms is still open since I heard it was being closed permanently sometime in my junior year after I left.\nTo be honest, it feels like you are in prison. No AC, everything is super outdated, bathrooms especially feel like prison bathrooms but the janitorial staff work hard to keep it clean so kudos to them. The internet connection ain't that great so I usually had to do the heavy data tasks at night when most people were asleep and I could get more bandwidth. The worst part for me was cooking since the kitchen was at the end of the hallway and I had to carry everything I needed there, cook, eat, wash the dishes, and haul it back which was exhausting.\nIf you plan on being at Towers and want to be more social I highly recommend switching to Wilson which is the other one where you will have a roommate and double the amount of people on a floor.",

            "comment": "I stayed there just last year. It's great because you get your own room, but that also means most people are pretty reserved and not outgoing at wallace. It's important to make friends quick there. The traveling by bus to campus can get annoying, but it's also nice not living directly on campus and feeling like where you live is separate from school itself. \n\nAlso, Wallace has 3 floors that are just for freshmen. I suggest making friends with the other freshman as being a year older won't matter. Others will say it, but I'll say it again: on the first day or two, keep your door open and see if people will introduce themselves but also introduce yourself to people. (This is how I made friends the first two days.)\n\nOverall, Wallace is a great hall. It comes with positives and negatives, but it's honestly just what you make of it. Wallace can be a very tight-nit community, and part of enjoying living there is making friends that live there so all your friends don't live in dorms over a mile from you. \n\np.s - freshman living in Wallace get first dibs on moving to different dorms if you don't like it there.",

I'm planning on staying there this coming year and didn't put in a request soon so unless I want to live in Frederickson apartments, I think this is my only choice.",

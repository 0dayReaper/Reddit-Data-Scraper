    "postText": "###Hope you had a great break!\n\nHello all, hope you had a great winter break and that you're ready for the Spring semester! I'm proud to say that I'm excited for this spring and upcoming Fall, as I have some decent news regarding CyRide that is bringing some service into the 21st Century as well as service restoration.\n\n\n\n---\n\n###Spring Schedule\n\nSpring Schedule starts today, January 17th, 2022. We will be on our regular schedule until Spring Break. **This includes restored weekend service!** We are no longer running a break schedule on the weekends as we have done an extremely hard push to get hired up. On Saturdays, riders can now expect 20 minute service all day on Red and 20 minute service on Blue from 11am-6pm. On Sundays, Red is still every 40 minutes (that has been the standard for years,) but riders can expect 20 minute blue service between 12:00pm-6:00pm. \n\nMoonlight will be operating on Fridays and Saturdays beginning January 20th until Spring Break. This also brings me to my next section...\n\n---\n\n###Moonlight and EASE improvements\n\nI'm not sure if many of you have ever used EASE or even know what it is, but I'm sure at least a few of you have used Moonlight at some point during your college career. We're proud to announce that we have implemented a demand-response software through a company called The Routing Company. Riders can download the \"Ride Pingo\" application on IOS and Android and now get a ride using the Pingo app instead of calling us. We will still be taking calls as normal but over time will encourage you to use the app, as our EASE and Moonlight drivers will essentially be getting turn by turn instructions to get to you. To use it, just open your application between 10:00pm-2:30am on Fridays and Saturdays and request a ride. Our driver will accept it and take you to your location within the service zone free of charge.\n\nThere is still limited service zones for this service, so if you already live along where the A shuttle operates, it will not allow you to request a ride and will direct you to that instead. \n\nThis service has also been implemented for EASE which has a much more limited service zone. EASE riders must either pay the standard fare or show their ISU ID or bus pass in order to use it.\n\nThis product is still in testing, so please be patient while we work out any bugs. At the moment it appears to be working as intended, so feel free to test it out this weekend! It's a pretty neat improvement in my opinion!\n\n---\n\n\n###Staffing\n\nI'm proud to say that since June 1st, 2022, we've hired and trained nearly 40 drivers and have reduced our weekly unfilled hours by almost 1000. Additionally, driver attrition seems to have decreased compared to previous years. That being said, we still have a very long way to go. \n\nWhile things are a little better for CyRide in terms of driver/dispatcher/supervisor burnout (I'm no longer working 60-70 hour weeks,) our next goal is to bring service back to what it used to be and bring back some extra buses on heavy trips, especially on routes like Orange, Blue, Gold, and Cherry. We simply haven't had the resources to ensure that everyone got a ride if they were at the stop, and my future goal is to make sure that we can provide that service most of the time. **That being said,** this will likely be another 6 month project. We will start bringing some extras that were permanently cut back this semester, however it will be spotty week to week in terms of consistency. For this semester at least, some days there might be an extra bus to help with loads, some days there won't. It all depends on what we have for staffing that day which can change week to week.\n\nNow normally, I would usually point out that CyRide is hiring, but I want to do a disclaimer here: we're still hiring, but we're really looking for morning (6:30am-12:00pm) and afternoon (1:00pm-8:00pm) availability, *especially* on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. We've hired quite a few students which has helped us significantly with our nights and weekends coverage, but for the time being night/weekend applicants likely won't be as prioritized as those with more open availability.\n\nI also have to include here if you're planning on applying:\n\n*Ames Transit Agency (D.B.A CyRide), an agency of the City of Ames, is an equal employment opportunity (EEO) employer. Position is subject to drug and alcohol testing.*\n\n---\n###Questions?\n\nThat's really all that's new so far! If anyone has anything that I can clarify or answer, please let me know! Feel free to PM me or leave a comment if that's the case.\n\nThank you!",

The wave indicates that all the drivers sort of have each other's back and will help each other out when needed. It's not just about the wave, it's about the sense of teamwork that our drivers should share.\n\nRealistically, the wave isn't distracting unless it's excessively animated - I don't think we've ever had a close call or accident related to a driver waving at another driver before.",

Drivers don\u2019t generally look at each other when they wave anyway; they\u2019re still focused on the road.\n\nIf there\u2019s ever any damning evidence that a simple wave is unsafe, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll revise our policy. Since 1976 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a single accident involving drivers waving to each other or it wouldn\u2019t be one of our priorities.",

Thus adding a quick wave should not add any distraction; instead it's just a quick acknowledgment of your surroundings.\n\nA similar, but not identical, idea is the [Point and Calling System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_and_calling) which is actually a proven safety method for operating public transit. I mention this to say that pointing or waving at something is not a noticeable distraction, and in fact improves critical awareness.",

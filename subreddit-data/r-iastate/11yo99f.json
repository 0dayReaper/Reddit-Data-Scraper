There are some bad reviews on google but that seems to be the common theme for every apartment. I would appreciate it a lot!",

It seems like they do that to everyone jeez. \n\nAbout the noise, I will be staying on a middle floor with a 1 bedroom above me. How bad is the noise from the people above? Are you saying the walls are like paper ?",

Had a friend staying in the same exact unit but different building also didn\u2019t resign and they didn\u2019t have a single person tour their until.",

I haven\u2019t had any issues with them, they tell us when maintenance is coming and other than that typically leave us alone. I only pay electric through Ames and rent is online. The biggest issue I\u2019ve had with them is the internet kinda sucks.",

We are each paying $495/mo (3 person apartment).\n\nSomeone else was talking about the noise thing, and I can confirm that you can hear your neighbors from time to time but it's not something that has ever been a serious issue. I also hate noisy neighbors and its not something that has bothered me much. We already resigned for next year because I think it's one of the better choices for apartments in Ames.",

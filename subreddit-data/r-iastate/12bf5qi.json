I would recommend taking initiative of meeting people in your dorm, classes or activities/clubs you attend, I made my best friends to this day this way. Engineering I would recommend living in Helser or Friley but not required. Definitely a college town and you can get around well enough without a car but having one after moving off campus helps.",

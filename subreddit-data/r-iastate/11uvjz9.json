I only had a meal plan my freshman year and now I cook for myself. There are always enough options that you can pick something you like.",

            "comment": "It's doable for the first year, but beyond that you just get tired of it. I think the biggest thing is the menu resets every 2 weeks, so after a year of dining center life you'll have tried everything it has to offer. In terms of how it compares to high school lunch, I'd say it's on par (not really better or worse), but you do have more options. For example, if I didn't like what was on the menu that day I could default to cereal, pasta, or salad which were always available. I do recommend having a stash of snacks for when the dining center is not open (early morning and late at night) or don't feel like walking over to one. These can either be purchased via the grace of your parents or most dining plans come with dining dollars you can use at campus convenience stores. Disclaimer: take my review with a grain of salt as I attended dining centers pre-pandemic; I'm not sure if they've recovered a full selection of options post-pandemic. P.S. I hope you like Pepsi products.",

I\u2019m not anywhere near seasons, but I only started going second semester and that has helped to give me more options. It\u2019s normal to want to go out, as well, so you still have that option. \n\nI don\u2019t know how good your high school lunch is but mine was pretty good, and I\u2019d say the dining halls here are miles better. I think it\u2019s best to start with the cardinal plan, and then you reevaluate how much you like the dining halls for second semester. If you just want more flex meals, then the cyclone plan might be a good option. The cardinal plan, though, is more than enough for most people. \n\nOverall, I like the dining halls a lot, considering it\u2019s incredibly easy to grab something quick and head to class. You\u2019ll have a lot of options as long as you check out each dining hall and try different flex meal locations.",

            "comment": "The food here is really good compared to my high school experience, but it does take some adjusting to. Personally, I can\u2019t each too much dining hall food in one week, or else my stomach starts to feel weird, but I also have an issue eating out too often. If you have a similar issue, they always have cereal, salads, and pizza. Plus seasons and UDCC both have made to order stations that are great. \n\nThe biggest issue is that you will get tired of it. Eventually it\u2019ll just be the same thing over and over, but that is when flex-meals and dining dollars really come in handy, so you can switch it up every so often.",

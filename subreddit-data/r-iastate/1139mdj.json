    "postText": "Does anybody know how will Chem 177L practical will go. I have it next week and I am confuse if I need to memorize all the experimental procedure from the reading for practical. Looks like I need to experiment make table, and know how to make a graph, but I am confuse if I need to memorize all procedure like how I do the experiment or is there going to be what do I need to do for experiment? Since English is not my first language, I am confuse with that.",

            "comment": "The 177L practical will be pretty simple and you\u2019ll have access to the procedure the entire duration of the practical. You will run an experiment and the purpose is to test how you interpret data. As long as you\u2019re able to take simple observations, then you\u2019re good. Also mess around with making graphs from data in both excel and google sheets.\n\nYou don\u2019t really need to have much prepared, but make sure to email your TA with questions or directly ask them during the practical for clarification.",

            "comment": "Hey there! I took Chem 177 in fall of 2021, and the practicals aren\u2019t bad at all! The first one was pretty easy if I remember correctly, just make sure you don\u2019t mess up on any calculations. You\u2019ll have the procedure available to you the whole time. It\u2019s basically like doing another lab but by yourself\n\nI do recommend looking at it beforehand and getting an idea of what to do, though. The second practical this semester deals with calorimetry and I made the mistake of not remembering how to do my stoich, so I messed up on the second one.",

Think about if you went to school in a country with a language you didn\u2019t know well. You\u2019d be worried about things you haven\u2019t done yet and look for advice.",

The two types of people who struggle are those who get anxious with the time limit and those who have a hard time processing written instructions quickly (there's also those who simply haven't been paying attention, but that's a different type of problem). Your TA is there to help.  \n\nBecause of the time limit, it will be very similar to a previous lab you've done. I was a TA a few years ago, and you'll probably do an experiment like one from the weights and measurements lab.",

I can't speak for everyone here, but I definitely don't have the money or frankly the time to show up to a basketball game every Saturday. And the fact that our team is doing badly isn't making want to go any more. If it were a women's game or something else where students get free tickets, I would be far more open to the suggestion, but expecting us to pay to show up to see our team lose is just bad practice.",

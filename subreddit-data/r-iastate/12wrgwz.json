Would appreciate any quick pointers getting up to speed l, submitting acceptance fee, housing list, dos/donts, etc??? \n\nWe went to U of Iowa visit after leaving Ames &amp; before we even hit lunch before the tour ... I think her decision was made...whew! \n\nTy",

Finishing her Junior year and has enjoyed her classes, going to football and basketball ball games.  She joined a sorority and lives in the house.  \n\nIf you live any distance away, buy bigger things online but ship to the stores in Ames or Ankeny.  We bought her microwave and mini fridge that way so I didn\u2019t have to carry it several states when driving.  There\u2019s a parent Facebook group where you can ask questions.  Probably not a lot of parents on this page.  \n\nDaughter didn\u2019t have a car freshman year, just used Cyride.  Depending on major, some have laptop programs.  Our D is design so we waited until she was accepted into her major after freshman core to purchase her laptop.  Also some majors the tuition increases once they get accepted into the major so be aware of that.  Best of luck.",

It doesn\u2019t take too long before those phone calls get further and further apart. \n\nAmazon lockers in town are a good option for when you need something delivered quickly, though they do fill up quickly in the fall. \n\nAir tags are useful if she\u2019s prone to losing things. \n\nThe parents group on Facebook is really helpful.",

I waited too long and ended up with a bunch of morning classes and everything was spaced out uncomfortably far apart. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but it affected my introduction to college more than I expected.\n\nAlso, as of two years ago, the acceptance fee was on the UBill. Everything goes on the Ubill, from the labcoat you buy at the MU store to a semester's tuition. It's honestly pretty convenient and makes things easier to keep track of, and you can always find it on AccessPlus. (AccessPlus is being phased out really soon so be prepared for things to get confusing with this.)\n\nMost questions are going to be more personal and up to the person in question. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions about anything specific like that!",

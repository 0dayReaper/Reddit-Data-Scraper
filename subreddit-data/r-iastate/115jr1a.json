            "comment": "\"Take home\" refers to your pay after tax and other things (401k contributions and benefits like healthcare) are deducted. It's the number on the paycheck.\n\nYear-to-date adds up things from the beginning of the year to the specified date. Usually the current date, but it sometimes is used for other date ranges. \n\nMy workplace (not ISU) shows YTD sums as my Gross pay, which is the opposite of Take Home since it's the pay before any deductions. Without seeing your pay stubs, it's really hard to say anything specific, but I hope this helps!",

Odds are, they've made a handful of exceptions here and there, because, well, they're human, and life happens. But its easier to justify your own choices because you known you and your own story. You have a full understanding of your own motivations. It's easy to assume the worst of your neighbors because you only see actions, not motivations. \n\nSome life advice from an Old: Don't try to control the behavior of other people. In any situation.

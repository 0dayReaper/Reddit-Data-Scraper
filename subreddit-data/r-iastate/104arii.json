I'm at a crosswalk with others waiting to cross Union where it meets up with Bissell, as there's plenty of buses out. A Cyride bus is turning from Bissell onto Union and a girl (texting on her phone) just walks into the crosswalk in front of the bus. I instinctively grabbed the back of her backpack and pulled her back over to the curb, while hearing the Cyride brakes being pressed and the bus just wasn't able to stop on the packed snow/ice. She looked up at me and was like \"what the fuck man?\" and was completely oblivious to the fact that she'd almost gotten pancaked while texting. Thankfully, one other student was like \"girl, he just saved your life.\"",

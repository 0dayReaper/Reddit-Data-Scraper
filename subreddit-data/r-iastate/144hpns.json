    "postText": "I got Freddy assigned to me. If I'm not able to get a dorm, what are the best possible buildings to live in at Freddy? I wanted to be close to main campus/gym. And would you reccomend 4 person 2 bedroom or 4 person 4 bedroom? \n\nI'm trying to change my room assignment, but it's only giving me Frederiksen Court and Wallace. Is everywhere else full, not open for selection yet, or am I not allowed to pick a dorm? I have been told my roommates will be younger if I pick a dorm, but my current ones are already 18. \n\nLastly, is it too late to join a learning community? They didn't allow you to select where you want to live if you joined one which is why I avoided it. Now it doesn't matter since I was assigned something either way.",

            "comment": "I can only really comment on the best buildings in Freddy- anything\u2019s in the 20s, 40s, 60s, 70s, and 80s will be on the southern side of Freddy and therefore closer to walk to campus or the gym. There is a bus top by building 22, between the 40s and 60s, between the 50s and 30s, and in front of the 10s. Route 21 (Cardinal) is what comes through freddy and can get you to most of campus and  close to state gym.\n\nAs far as rooms, 4 person 2 bed means you\u2019ll share a room with someone else like in a dorm. 4 person 4 bed means you\u2019ll get your own room but it will be quite small. The nice thing about freddy is that you have in unit laundry which you don\u2019t get anywhere else living in ISUs campus.",

            "comment": "I'd say the 60s cluster could be a good fit for you due to their proximity to cardinal bus stops and lied gym. I lived in building 63 and loved it there. \n\nAlso, make sure you have a dining contract cause in my freshman year I had forgotten to take one and these two were my only options until I took a meal plan.",

I just got it now, but Freddy and Wallace are only showing. I'll check again over the next few days and see if that changes anything. Hopefully that fixes it, thanks!",

    "postText": "hello! I am wondering what a 'good' score on the aleks math placement test is? I already knew I would score lower, but not too low on it as I am neurodivergent and am in a lower high school math class but I am wondering if I should retake it or go with what I have? I am close to the second level of minimum score, 39 but I am not sure if I would struggle in those classes. I am going into graphic design as well so I wont need math a whole lot compared to other majors. any words of wisdom on what is a 'good' score and the different level of classes?",

The most important thing is that it actually reflects your capabilities. Unless you feel like you got some wrong that you know you'd be able to get if you reviewed the material more, just stick with the score you got.",

            "comment": "I believe a \u201cgood score\u201d is subjective to how good you are at math to begin with. You said you already knew you would score lower, so I wouldn\u2019t put pressure on your expectations for what score you got. It\u2019s important to note that the test really does help determine which class you should go in for the sake of helping you build specific foundations or stepping stones, so you can take it again but if you score are the same I don\u2019t think you should take it again. From what I understand, unless you\u2019re required to take a specific math class it is up to you which one you decide to take. I would look closely at the descriptions and maybe do some research on past reviews for the classes you think you might wanna take.",

            "comment": "I would say a good score reflects the courses you have successfully taken.   That is, hopefully your score points you at the next untaken course.  If your score is substantially lower than that, perhaps a few hours refreshing your memory on concepts you learned but are perhaps now a bit dusty will result in a better and more accurate score.",

            "comment": "The test is out of /100. I wouldn\u2019t pay too much attention to your results, just listen to what your advisor recommends for which math class to take. I got a 98/100 which SOUNDS good but I took the test over a course of 6 hours (bc I am insane) &amp; I also studied a lot since I haven\u2019t taken maths since 2017. I tested into Calc 2 + I think, but no way in hell am I ready for that, so I\u2019m starting with Calc 1. \n\nHighly recommend taking the next class up in math you took from previous schooling, if you tested into it. If not, just take the test again. It\u2019s no biggie, people retake it all the time and if you don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s an accurate reflection of your math knowledge it won\u2019t hurt.",

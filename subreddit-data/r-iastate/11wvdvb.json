If it Isn't im pretty sure you can retake to improve your grade?\n\nI will say back when I changed my major and needed some credits I found a bunch of half semester online courses that were a lot of fun! Age of dinosaurs, geological disasters, world film... I don't know if they are all still there, but it might be worth looking into a fun half semester course you will enjoy!",

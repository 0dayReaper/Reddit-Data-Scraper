My photo doesn't really do the food justice, but it tasted great and was nice to have a \"normal\" Thanksgiving meal while being stuck in the dorm. (There was also green bean casserole and another roll that I already ate along with a bunch of other bonus treats.) I hope this option will be available again in the future!",

Besides, your email is tied to your university account. All they need to know is that you are a student/staff. Once you graduate/drop-out/quit, it stays active for maybe 6 months before they deactivate it. I doubt there would ever be a situation where you would have to validate through email where it would be legit.\n\nAnd sorry if I didn't catch any sarcasm.",

    "postText": "Hello! As the title says, I\u2019m a transfer student beginning my second semester here who\u2019s been having a tough time, to put it mildly, fitting in here at ISU and meeting new friends. When I returned here after a two year hiatus back in July, I really didn\u2019t have any idea how different the university experience is (socially, that is) for transfer students vs traditional students who come here straight out of high school and stay all 4 years. \n\nI live off campus, which is a lot more limiting it seems than living on campus in terms of being able to get involved in clubs. Speaking of which, while I did attend Club-Fest last August, I\u2019ve quickly realized that I\u2019m really only going to have time to get involved in one or two clubs seriously enough to meet people. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just curious to hear from other transfer students here at ISU who may have been in a similar situation as me. How did you fit in here? Are there any other social events/gatherings in the area (either in Ames or Des Moines maybe) that could help me meet new people around my age? (22) I\u2019m going to be here for the next two and a half years, so I really want to make the most of this time and not be a complete social hermit like I was in high school.",

            "comment": "I hate to sound redundant, but join a club.  I was a non-traditional transfer student who lived in Ames and knew no one. I committed myself to joining one club and sticking to it.  It happened to be my major club, so that was nice. If you're a woman in STEM, check out the WISE programs. Maybe sign up as a free agent for an intramural sport. \n\nAlso, I just normally met people in class.  I attended every day, participated, and didn't hide in the back row or corner.  Normal interactions happened with those around me, and sometimes we'd exchange info for homework or projects.  That's a start.\n\nWhat are you into? There has to be at least one club on campus that you share an interest with.  If you're comfortable sharing, what's your major?",

Being in too many things can actually make it harder to meet people and make friends (at least in my experience). There's another ClubFest this week or next week if you want to find different clubs. But definitely pick one or two and attend the meetings regularly. It just takes time to really meet people and get to know them.\n\nGetting a job on campus can also be a good way to meet people. I made friends from all grades from my campus jobs.\n\nIf you're religious, there's a lot of options for clubs related to that. I know a lot of people who have formed really close friends from different campus ministry groups.",

It seemed like everyone my age/year had already established their friend groups and weren\u2019t looking for newbies. \n\nI lived on campus which helped. My random roommate was also a transfer student and we became good friends. I got involved in my dorm leadership team to meet more people. I wouldn\u2019t say I was \u201cfriends\u201d with many of them, but it\u2019s nice to have acquaintances to chat with and who know you exist. \n\nI had an internship/job and am still in touch with quite a few of my coworkers. \n\nI joined one club relevant to my major that would look good on my resume. Try to find a smaller, more niche club where you can make a bigger impact. Some clubs have 100s of people and if you\u2019re an introvert, it\u2019s hard to find your way into the group. I personally found clubs boring unless I had a chair position, I liked to be actively engaged, not a passive attendee. If nothing else, it\u2019ll keep you busy and add to your resume. \n\nIf you\u2019re even slightly religious, look at joining a church group. They seemed to have the most close knit fellowship and are generally very nice people. \n\nFind a girlfriend/boyfriend. Easier said than done. But obviously helps fill your time. \n\nTake care of yourself. Go to the gym, take fitness classes. Iowa State has a club for everything but the Ames community also has some clubs. One friend made a lot of friends in the ROTC fitness class, mainly because it was brutally early and they could commiserate lol. \n\nIt probably took me a year to feel happy on campus. Until then I just made sure to keep busy. I personally liked having structure so I would plan out all my evenings. And keep in touch with your family and friends from community college or high school.",

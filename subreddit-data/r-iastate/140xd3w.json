    "postText": "Rent is 325 a month and utilities are separate, usually around $40. I\u2019m looking for 3 male roommates, preferably juniors or older, for a 4 bedroom apartment in west Ames. 2 roommates graduated, and the third is going abroad for the fall.\n\nThe apartment has 4 bedrooms including mine, 2 bathrooms, laundry in unit. Parking is free, pets are allowed. The lease is for a full year, August-July, but the Landlord won\u2019t have any issues with subleasing if you don\u2019t want to stay the whole time. DM me if you are interested or have any questions!",

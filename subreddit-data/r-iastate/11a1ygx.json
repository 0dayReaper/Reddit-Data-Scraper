If we start with a different product, we actually have to have management contact our menu guy to change what's listed to reflect what's actually being served. \n\nThis does not, however, always occur, and also doesn't have to happen necessarily when a product runs out and we run a replacement item. Regardless, signage on the product itself should be correct.\n\nAs for the rest, you're likely not wrong and that's definitely above my pay grade.",

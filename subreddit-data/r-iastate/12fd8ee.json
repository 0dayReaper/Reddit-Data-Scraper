And I have noticed that whenever I talk to them its hard for them to understand what is coming out of my mouth and I have to repeat myself. Is there a facility on campus that can help with me with speaking clearly?",

He teaches a graduate class on pronunciation (don\u2019t know exactly when the class is offered) where he runs a pronunciation tutoring project. You may be able to be a tutee in that. It\u2019s only a couple of weeks, but it\u2019s still something. He might have other suggestions that will help you in the long term.",

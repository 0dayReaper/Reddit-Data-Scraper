            "comment": "When I took 311 over the summer (2021) it was very intensive, but only for 8 weeks. We had class every day Mon-Fri, and there was an exam every Monday (7 exams). Unsure if your instructor will structure it the same though. I had it with Mitra, who by all accounts, is quite literally the best professor that teaches the class. \n\nI\u2019m very thankful that I was able to take it by itself without needing to work, because I\u2019m not sure how I would\u2019ve managed. If I\u2019m being totally honest, working 40 hours a week during the summer semester will make passing extremely difficult if you don\u2019t already have a good understanding of algorithms. Few undergraduate classes match the sheer brutality of 311. \n\nIf you must do both during the summer, here\u2019s what you should do:\n\n1. Find a section that starts in June. \n2. After finals in May, really enjoy the hell out of yourself for one weekend. Relax like you\u2019ve never relaxed before because you\u2019ll need the energy.\n3. Get an algorithms textbook, find a whiteboard, and begin to ACTIVELY study. Meaning that your study sessions will be you, on your feet, painstakingly working out the intricacies of the textbook material. And you will keep doing this as much as time will allow in between your co-op work until class begins. \n4. Survive the horrors of 311. \n\nGood luck.",

Lectures were recorded so I would just watch them after I got off work. \n\nThe class was way easier over the summer than it was when I failed it during the Fall semester. It probably helped being able to just focus on one class during the summer, but it was also graded more leninetly.",

Now you know. No one is gatekeeping you, just correcting your semantics.\n\nEdit: The reason for this distinction is that the remakes are only able to directly trade back and forth with the other games of their generation.\n\nFor example, FireRed and LeafGreen can both directly trade back and forth with Ruby, Sapphire,  and Emerald, (and Colosseum and XD), so they are all Generation 3 games. These games *can\u2019t* freely trade back and forth with the Gen 4 games (DPP and HGSS). Pok\u00e9mon can be transferred from FRLG to HGSS, but they can never go back.\n\n**TLDR**: The *region* of a Pok\u00e9mon game refers to where the game takes place, not the generation. The generation of a Pok\u00e9mon game refers to what other games it can trade with.",

The generation is determined by what Pokemon and moves etc exist at the time. HGSS has Generation 4 Pokemon available in it, so it can't be a Gen 2 game as Gen 4 Pokemon didn't exist in Gen 2.\n\nhttps://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Generation",

While this may not be technically the correct usage I think this is why people usually use the terms like that",

Generation 1 is clearly RBY, and spin off games as well including Stadium, hey you, tcg, etc.. basically 1996-2000. Generation 2 is primarily GSC, and sides like Stadium 2 and anything really between 2000-2003. Gen 3 is RSE, but also FRLG, and many spin offs like mystery dungeon, Colosseum, XD, etc.. 2003-2007. Gen 4 is DPPt, HGSS, and some others like Pokepark, Ranger, Mystery Dungeon 2 and Revolution, 2007-2011. 2011 is BW and BW2, with a few other side games like Conquest, 2011-2013. Gen 6 is XY and ORAS, as well as Bank, Super Mystery Dungeon, and Rumble, 2013-2016. Gen 7 is a little weird because it is SM and USUM, but also GO falls on the frnce eith the release of Melmetal. LGPE falls in Gen 7, making it really 2016-2019, and we are now in 8 with SwSh.",

You could then use local wifi to connect to another 3ds with a legit copy of heardgold/soulsilver and trade the pokemon.. then transfer it all to black/white, then to poke bank. As long as the pokemon stats were not hacked it will be accepted.",

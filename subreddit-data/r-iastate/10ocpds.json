Claimed normally those lower picks get a lot of prints, but he says Brock for one reason or another didn\u2019t have many prints. I\u2019m on the fence about whether or not I should get a custom jersey for PURDY. Want to rep him if he makes the SB, but also want to a legit jersey and not a knockoff.",

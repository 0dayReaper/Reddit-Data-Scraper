    "postText": "I am a freshman currently majoring in computer engineering. I was planning to graduate a year early, and after completing my POS, it is possible to complete this 4-year degree in 3 years but take some of the courses in the summer. I don't mind the workload,  but I'd like to know if it's a good idea. I might miss out on something; I am trying to determine your thoughts.",

There\u2019s no point in staying here longer than you need to, every class is free after 15 credits so you\u2019d be saving money in the long run. \n\nAlthough be careful not to overwork yourself. It\u2019s incredibly easy to fall behind when you take a lot of classes. You know yourself better than anyone, if you know you can keep up and will stay on top of workload then it\u2019s a no brainer to do it in 3 years.",

Enjoy college, explore, take random classes that don\u2019t have anything to do with your major\u2026 expand your intellectual curiosity! Study abroad, learn about new cultures and meet new people! This is the time for you to make mistakes (within reason) and learn from them\u2026\nTrust me! Once you are out here in the workforce and realize that you only have a couple of weeks of time off a year, to travel, visit family, explore new hobbies and interest! You\u2019ll look back and realize how good life was back then! (It\u2019s been 8 years since I graduated and sometimes I wish I could go back!)",

            "comment": "Computer Engineering is an incredibly difficult degree. While I'm sure you could probably pull it off if you plan your courses correctly, you're probably going to be miserable the whole time.  Also, instead of taking classes over the summer it'd be worth considering going for an internship instead. That'll give you an idea of what kind of work you want to do and make finding a job much easier once you're out of college.",

You can leverage real world experience when interviewing for post grad positions. If you think about it, summer internships/part time engineering during the next three-four years may add up (salary wise) to the year you would shave off by grinding school only. But you\u2019d have experience at multiple companies rather than a year as an entry level at the same company. In this scenario, the kid with multiple internships has a better resume overall.",

You\u2019ll never get that opportunity again. The \u201creal\u201d world isn\u2019t that much fun and you\u2019ll make enough when you graduate to compensate for the potential extra year of school",

It opens up ur ability to do things outside of school like others have suggested, but also helps you get opportunities to boost your career like working in a lab, being a TA, doing internships and Coops, Potentially doing a concurrent program where you get an under grad and a masters in 5 years rather than 6+. School is more than just classes and those extra experiences matter too!! But it is ultimately ur decision if u are confident in urself and your decision. Go for it",

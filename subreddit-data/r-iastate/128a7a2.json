            "comment": "Are you talking about the Academic Program for Excellence? \nIf so, hands down, this will be one of the best experiences you\u2019ll have at ISU. \nBack in the day (holy shit! 2010!!) they were two summer programs for multicultural students, Apex and Speed. Speed was focused on students that were going into engineering, while Apex was more general. I was part of speed and both groups were housed on the same floor, so I got to meet some peps from the Apex group. \nAnyways, besides the fact that it\u2019s free and you can gain up to 8 credits in the summer! You\u2019ll learn about resources available and how to get around the campus. Trust me, it\u2019s way easier to get around and learn where everything is at when there are only a couple hundred people on campus, than when you arrive the first week of school along with +30K students! \nYou\u2019ll meet people that will become your support system through your next four years and some will become your friends for life. \nDon\u2019t know the current stats, but from my generation almost everyone graduated! \nI can share my entire experience, but do you have more specific questions?",

Basically, APEX is a jump start and ease into College type program that Iowa State offers. Students can also earn credit hours towards graduation and live on campus for the Summer and get a fee of both the Iowa State campus and Ames generally. I did a similar program at a different university 20+ years ago. My experience was great to transition from high school to college and I have told my daughter the same.",

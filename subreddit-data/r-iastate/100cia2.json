    "postText": "So I was an undergrad here, and got into a grad program here. I\u2019m pretty sure I finished everything I needed to do to graduate, but I never got any sort of confirmation on it. \n\nSince I\u2019m a grad student I can\u2019t access the degree audit, and my advisor won\u2019t respond. \n\nIs there any way to check that I actually graduated? Am I supposed to get a letter or something?\n\nEdit: they sent me an email today confirming I did in fact graduate. The registrar was able to tell me that my audit looked fine, which is nice ig, but not if I actually was considered graduated.",

You first need to fill you POSC in accessplus and have it approved by the major professor (if you have one) and DOGE as well as committee members (if you have them and they are usually have them when you have MS thesis to defend). \nEither you are an undergraduate or graduate student, you must apply for gradation I believe the semester before in order to graduate",

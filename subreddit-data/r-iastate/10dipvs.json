    "postText": " I'm going to start attending classes here this spring and have tried doing a little research into different things I'll need for classes, such as a laptop. I did hear several people saying that the spec recommendations from the college itself are overkill, so I tried to keep that in mind while looking for a laptop. I bought a laptop that I thought should be fine (i5-7300u processor, 8gb ram, 256 gb nvme ssd), but I wanted to make sure that this should be completely fine for coursework over the next 2-3 years. I don't know how much is actually done in a class or lab, but I do have a powerful computer at home that should be able to handle anything outside campus.   \n\nThanks for any and all responses!",

Windows will always eat up 2GB, and chrome eats the hell out of it too.\n\nThat being said, as long as you don't keep like 30 tabs open along with 8 other apps, that should be fine enough. You really don't need something super powerful, and if you ever need more I'm pretty sure you could just remote to a faster computer in one of the labs.",

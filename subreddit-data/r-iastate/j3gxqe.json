That's the equivalent of the main desk near the entrance now. ~~You'd tell the staff there what book you wanted, and they'd go back into the tiers to get it for you.~~ Edit - misremembered, this was just the reference station to get help. The equivalent of the circulation desk with the staff who would go get the books for you was in the rotunda.\n\nThe original building has the footprint of the reading room (so the rooms below - like classroom 198) and rotunda areas, the hall leading from them back to the double doors (where it Ts into the LCC on first floor) which used to be the west wall of the building (so this area includes the cafe, fireplace room, and Solution Center staff area), and the tiers north to where the floors turn from marble to linoleum (the marble is the original).\n\nThe first (of three) additions moved the west wall out to about halfway to the current wall to make room for more shelving areas. The second moved it out to include the entirety of the current LCC area for yet more shelving room and also extended the tiers and added a new entrance on the south side of the building. Both of these additions were in the '60s.\n\nThe third addition in the '80s added the southern part of the building with the big curtain windows and whatnot. If you're on the second floor walkway towards the periodical room, and look north further into the building you see all of the windows into interior rooms? Those used to be the exterior windows from the original '20s building.",

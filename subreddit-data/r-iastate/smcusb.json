Let me walk you viewers through it:\n\nYou'll notice the lack of a sun, both from the perspective of the individual with a camera, as they're walking toward the ladder, and as they're walking up the ladder. Now, we know the face of the Campa-Meal faces to the South, so the cameraman is walking Northward. Logically, the sun would either be to the right of the screen, as it rises, or to the left of the screen, as it sets. It cannot be overhead, as we would otherwise see during the ladder climb.\n\nThis puts the sun ***behind*** the cameraman, a fact further proven by the completely horizontal lines of shadow across the southern face of the tower. If the sun were real, we'd either have seen it, or the shadows would be different.\n\n8/10, though, really honestly great CGI work I doubt the layman would otherwise ever be able to tell.",

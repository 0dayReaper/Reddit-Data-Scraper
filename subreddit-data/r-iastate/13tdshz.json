It freaking sucks and you can\u2019t hardly do anything in the programs without having some sort of buffer time that locks up the program. Granted fusion 360 has never been good with large files with multiple components. but a good, solid laptop is so worth it. No matter what engineering major you go into I am assuming they will make you use some sort of CAD program. I\u2019m running a Lenovo Thinkpad P15 gen 2 and it is a dream and was built to handle CAD programs. It\u2019s a workstation so it is pretty beefy, but so worth the extra weight. They came out with the P15v gen3 which I would highly recommend looking into (it runs about 1.5k-2.3k depending on how you build it out). I\u2019m personally not a dell fanboy and haven\u2019t had good experiences with them, but Lenovo Thinkpads have  never let me down.",

A lot of engineering majors probably don't have to run 3D CAD software that often, and if they do, their major is going to have computer labs set up to run those programs just fine. It also usually wouldn't be until junior/senior classes. I may be wrong, but I don't think that Ag Engineering is going to be doing a bunch of modeling on solidworks. If they are, it would be later in the curriculum, so it's a bit silly to overpay for a laptop now if you aren't going to use the extra hardware until later. Especially since the technology in a laptop will definitely improve within those 2 years.  \nPersonally, I'd rather just have a desktop at home to run the hard stuff, and if I really need to run it on campus, go to a computer lab. If you've got $1.5k-$2.3k burning a hole in your pocket that you really want to throw at an overpriced laptop, more power to ya.",

Generally, speaking Precision lines are better quality than XPS, you can also buy refurbished Precision 55X0 from DellRefurbished.com for cheap. RAM as mentioned would not be an issue for the Precision, these are user upgradable, remove the rear panel, plug and play the new RAM. I believe any engineering student should have the capability to do it. \n\nTLDR: save your money use the school computers, spend the money elsewhere: hobby, new shirts and suits for interviews, socializing with other engineering students. If you have to pick, get the Precision",

            "comment": "Agron 342 was insanely easy, and every business class I\u2019ve taken for my minor (including 300 and 400 level) has been really easy too. The business classes are extremely easy in terms of difficulty, but they have a frustrating amount of non-value adding/ busy work that makes them less recommendable. I\u2019ve heard a lot of the TSM courses are easy tech electives.\n\nMy favorite tech elective has been ME / FSHN 273X, which will be ME/FSHN 373 this upcoming fall. It\u2019s the science of beer brewing, it\u2019s a super interesting class, dedicated professors, and genuinely a class that\u2019s a one-of-a-kind opportunity. You\u2019re learning about the biochemistry behind brewing and also making your own beer in labs.",

It will get changed to 373 this fall which will make it less confusing. I just checked and it\u2019s listed as 373X this fall so that\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to search for.",

    "postText": "I didn\u2019t really study for it and I got a 76 on the ALEKS test which is exactly the minimum score for calc 1. I\u2019m worried that won\u2019t be enough to get into calc 1 since I barely qualified. However, I took AP Calc AB in high school and I got a B+ first semester and a B the second semester (didn\u2019t take the AP test), so I think I\u2019d do well in calc 1 but idk if my ALEKS score would allow me to take it.\n\nEdit: I met with my advisor today and he put me in calc 1, if anyone else is wondering the same thing",

            "comment": "ALEKS test is just something to guess how well you know stuff. You have 5 times to take it so perhaps just study up (worth doing anyway/provided links below) wouldn't stress it and just take calc 1 fall semester (cause it is harder than AP Calc AB and worth it), and use the summer to study your algebra basics, trig identities, unit circle (used a lot), and basic trig. Calculus 1 at ISU is fairly hard and is pretty good for setting you up for success in calc 2. Then check out Steve Butler for his vids [https://www.calc1.org/](https://www.calc1.org/) He is a good math professor at ISU and I think he writes the exams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSteve Butler has 2 videos he wants people to take before taking Calc 1. You should study them anyway so might as well now and use that for prep for the ALEKS test.\n\nAlgebra: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q\\_P-MsaAPU0&amp;ab\\_channel=ProfessorButler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_P-MsaAPU0&amp;ab_channel=ProfessorButler)\n\nTrig: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aOXKckoFMU&amp;ab\\_channel=ProfessorButler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aOXKckoFMU&amp;ab_channel=ProfessorButler)",

Plus it\u2019ll likely be your first semester at school so it\u2019s good to take something that you\u2019ll already have some understanding in with how stressful the first semester is (or was for me)\n\nGood luck!",

I got a 93 and ended up with a B+ in Calc 1, however, my friend got a 77 and she ended up with an A. \n\nALEKs isn't the only factor testing your math skills. Make sure to put in the work, do your HWs, ask questions, go to help hours and TA hours, and do all the practice tests and you'll end up doing very well. Treat it as a job instead of class and you'll succeed.\n\nI didn't really do much of that for Calc 1 and I ended up with a B+ but I did it for Calc 2 and ended up with an A.

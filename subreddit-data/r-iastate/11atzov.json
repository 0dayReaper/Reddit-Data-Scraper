However Man Basnet curved it a lot and gave a lot chance to get points back.\n\nBoth classes have Steve Butler videos so neither should be too devastating if you watch them.",

Calc 1 and 2 were quite easy for me, but I really, really struggled in calc 3. 266/267 has been much smoother so far, which seems to be the general consensus with everyone I know",

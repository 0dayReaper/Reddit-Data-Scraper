    "postText": "I just looked at my U-Bill and saw that I received a refund of the prepayment for my dorm. If I get this money to my bank account through direct-deposit, will it create any tax problems? It's a refund, so I think it would be okay, but I'm an international student, so I'm not sure. Oh and I'm supposed to get this money back, right? It's not an error or anything?",

    "postText": "I am currently a community college student transferring to Iowa State next fall, and I am interested in majoring in electrical engineering. I was hoping to get some input on certain professors I should avoid; for some context, I will have calc 1-3, Physics 1 and 2, and linear algebra finished before I head there in the fall. However, I have been told that certain courses, signals and systems in particular to be weed out classes. In addition after seeing the low rated professors in the EE department on rate my professor. I wanted to get input and see if there are any professors you recommend for the EE-200-EE-300 courses and some to avoid like the plauge. Thanks in advance!!",

            "comment": "It will be difficult without knowing exactly what classes you mean to take. Signals and systems wasn't terrible, it was just difficult because Bolsted likes a reverse class room setup where you watch videos over the subject before coming to class. The videos were not great and the subject is a bit confusing. Overall EE 230 was the hardest for me thus far, but most teachers give a good curve.\n\nI believe you will do fine, most of the difficult class will have a curve that should get you a good grade as long as you do the work.\n\nGood luck",

Others are right it's hard to control who you get when enrollment opens, but pro tip you can change your class sections up to the end of the first week of classes without advisor help.\n\nIf you want a specific prof or time just keep checking access plus til it's open, at least every day. Eventually someone will drop or switch sections. Pay special attention the days after grades are released, right before classes start, and during the first week. People drop out, plans change, work schedules shift. There will be a slot at some point for all but the smallest and most in demand classes.\n\nAlso, attempt to add the class, even if it's full. Advisors in ME told me that this adds to a report and they may adjust class sizes or open up slots late. Not sure how often this happens tho...",

If you don't plan on working in a semiconductor fab, you don't need EE330. Wish I'd taken the easy way out and saved a lot of time and effort.\n\n(For context: EE330 is all about how the wafers are made. Etching, chemical vapor deposition, designing a chip and using NAND gates a lot. EE332 is a more abstract look at the same things, with less work.)",

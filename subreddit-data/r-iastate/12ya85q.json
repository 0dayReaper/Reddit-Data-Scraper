    "postText": "My partner and I are looking to live in the university village for the school year of 24-25 (just thinking ahead, lmao), and we would need to live in a pet-friendly apartment. \n\nOur biggest concern is whether or not it is competitive to get an apartment unit or not- specifically the pet-friendly units. We just want to figure out logistics :p\n\nThanks for the help yall",

            "comment": "I lived in a pet friendly unit in the 21-22 year and from my experience there would probably be no issues if both of you apply on time for the same unit. There are usually a couple empty pet friendly units during the school year. \n\n\n(Please disregard this section if not applicable) Keep in mind that if you guys are not returning   students, they might try to separate you guys because they prefer same sex housing. Just make sure to contact the housing department and let them know your decisions. IIRC, they cannot legally assign roommates of different genders to regular units so pet friendly is your only option for on campus housing in the area. \n\nAnother thing to note about pet friendly units is that they cannot legally assign random roommates to your unit so should 1 of you move out, the remaining person will be responsible for the full rent. \n\nTLDR; not really, just apply as soon as possible during the application window and you should get it.",

I (M) applied to a pet friendly unit with a female friend of mine. We quickly found out a week or 2 before the semester started that we were both reassigned until we contacted the housing department. \n\nSince you are both returning to campus, there probably shouldn\u2019t be any issue :)\n\nThe staff at SUVCC are also quite helpful if you would like to talk to them.",

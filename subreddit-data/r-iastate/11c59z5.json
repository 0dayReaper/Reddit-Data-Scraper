As an employer that goes to the Iowa State career fair every fall/spring, I can tell you that any computer-related major is very competitive and you will likely find a long line with any company you might want to talk to",

As if party goers are constantly on the hunt for people studying for an exam so they can drag them to a party by force or something (or peer pressure, whatever). Outside of a handful of interrupted sleeps, it has never been a big deal. \n\nControversial option here maybe, but you should absolutely party in college. The trick is learn to be an adult and party responsibly. Most people aren\u2019t going to think you are a stick-in-the-mud if you party/drink in moderation. That\u2019s really the key: Moderation. Moderation. Moderation. You\u2019ll get most of the benefits of social connection without destroying your liver and grades.",

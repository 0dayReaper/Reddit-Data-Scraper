If dancing is your thing I know the swing club goes dancing at lake Robbins some weekends. If biking is your thing consider joining the isu cycling club discord and see if anyone wants to go cycling to ada Hayden or around town. Or maybe just bring a paper and pencil to ada Hayden and draw by the lake and try to make small talk with people around if they're interested.\n\nThese are all things I do or have done in the past to meet people, but I think the most effective for me is talking to people at parties but you kinda gotta know someone who's hosting.",

If you're high-achieving, comfortable coding medium-sized hw projects in Java, AND fine with discrete math and proof techniques, you'll be okay. There's a reason they advise against taking 228 and 230 at the same time though, and adding GenChem 2,  Linear Algebra, AND another class will be rough. \n\nI only have experience with 2 of the 4 courses you have listed as an SE major, but this seems heavier than I'd suggest. Maybe swap some gen eds around from your plan for future semesters to fill in the credits if you need to be taking 5 courses in the Fall.",

If you're willing to drive, Ciro at Cryptic Crow Tattoo in Fort Dodge has done two of my tattoos (one when he was an apprentice) and has a really nice thin line stuff. @crypticcrowtattoo and @inkedbyciro on instagram",

Heroic Ink has always screwed up any piercing they\u2019ve given me, both from wrong jewelry for healing and giving me infections. I\u2019m a huge fan of Asylum on Welch because they always know how to reverse the damage.",

    "postText": "I am a junior classification as I\u2019ve taken all my gen ed\u2019s in hs but I still consider myself a sophomore. I\u2019m in 319, 363, 288, and 230 for a minor in CYB. I like coding but I don\u2019t think I want to do it every day forever, and would rather have a manager position in the future. I loved 281 and the hands on stuff, and was hoping 319 would help me decide on SE or CPR E but now realizing it\u2019s cross listed with COM S a part of me is like what are the differences in the degree and should I switch to CPR E if it\u2019s a more desirable major for employers? I am starting to feel like SE is just a justified COM S. If I switch this semester or next I would still be able to graduate on time. I\u2019m not sure which is a better major for a management future / job security.",

            "comment": "Hello, SE/Cyber grad here (Who works in Security currently). I didn't want to code all day either (hence the cyber) but learning good coding practices is a very important part of working in Cybersecurity. Secure code reviews and being able to write python scripts to help automate your job is a strong skill to have. There isn't a better one for a job in the future. Realistically staying in SE will just mean you aren't required to take Physics II or Calc 3 and you can skip the EE course(s)? that CprE has to take. If you enjoyed 281, I think you'd enjoy CprE 288 (Embedded Systems) over COMS 327(?), and as an SE, you can make that choice. The majors have a lot of overlapping classes. Hope this helped!",

There\u2019s plenty of other fields besides SWE, but I\u2019d also say that in generally I found internships to be significantly more interesting than course work. I think it\u2019s really difficult to get a true feel for any CS job by only taking the classes.",

Then SE or CPR E are applicable.\n\nAny of these majors can get you towards the management part. The most important part is applying/securing internships to help you land the jobs you want. You can also adjust your classes to add those that you think may be helpful.",

But I know senior software engineers and tech leads who majored in mis or math. If you\u2019re thinking more delivery manager, product manager, engineering manager, a technical background helps but most people I know have more of a business oriented degree. Like mis, accounting, finance. \n\nLike someone else said, focus on internships and experiences to build our your resume. The degree is more a foot in the door, you still have to sell yourself.",

You can take most classes either way.",

I will say there are a lot of Software Engineering managers who were even Com S or MIS, including some I have had in the past. The fact that you're minoring in cyber security is a positive and I think that with SE will be good.",

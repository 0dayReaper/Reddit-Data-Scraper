    "postText": "Hey all, some kids from my apartment block found an abandoned bike outside and were giving it away to whoever wanted it, so I'm holding onto it and seeing if it belongs to anyone. It's a fairly new looking Magna Outreach, brakes are a little busted, but I think it's a victim of the bike theft circle around here. It doesn't look like it's been pieced out yet.\n\nIf you're missing a Magna Outreach, DM me a picture of it or some characteristics, like what kind of seat etc. I can bring it back to you.",

Someone who's a non-redditor might have filed a police report.\n\nISUPD non-emergency: 515-294-4428.\n\nAmes PD non-emergency: 515-239-5133.\n\nBest to call both of those numbers during normal office hours.  Let them know you have an abandoned bicycle that you suspect might have been stolen and you'd like to see if anyone has reported it.  They should be able to direct your call appropriately.",

I've nearly had my own bike stolen from me by ISUPD after I'd recovered it in the past because they \"couldn't be sure if it was mine\" with anything short of registry, so I'm, I hope understandably, hesitant to contact them directly.",

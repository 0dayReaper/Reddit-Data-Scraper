I\u2019m not sure what you mean by a natural thing that can be planted but if you are referring to cover crops, then yes they can help with SOME runoff and help greatly with soil erosion, but the majority of farmers do not want to deal with planting them. The reality is that widespread implementation is very difficult, and it\u2019s not a black and white issue. \n\nYes, ag runoff is a huge problem, I know. I\u2019m an ag engineer, so I\u2019m acutely aware of the problems it causes. But it\u2019s not something that can be fixed overnight.",

Also, not all of Iowa is like you describe. I\u2019m from southern Iowa and you are just as likely to see a field of CRP (native grasses and wildflowers) as you are row crops, due to how hilly the land is. \n\nIowa also has the Nutrient Reduction Strategy, which aims at installing the practice you described and many more, such as saturated buffers, bioreactors, etc. \n\nThe Ag and Biosystems Engineering department here is practically leading the country in conservation practice innovation and development. Iowa ag certainly needs to change, but to say we have done nothing is completely disregarding the hard work done by researchers, county conservation boards, the almost 100 NRCS field offices in the state, and the farmers that put time and effort into making their farms more sustainable.",

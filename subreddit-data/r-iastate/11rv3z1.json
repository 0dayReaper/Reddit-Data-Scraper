The cage locked, kept the \u201cvaluables\u201d secured, don\u2019t ever remember locking it, tho\u2026 The computer guy before me started the wipe and price part of the sale, I was his replacement. Saw the inside of most computers from late 70s era up to current-ish equipment. All kinds of really cool stuff, computers and otherwise!\n\nMy favorite item we picked up and sold was probably the original safe that came out of Beardshear, like where they put student payments waaaay back when. We did sell one of the university planes on closed bid, too. Coolest computers were probably the SGI workstations that had an original price tag of like $35k. Each.",

Microsoft came after the university for selling computers with Windows that had OEM licenses and 2. our PXE server somehow was compromised and was DDoS'ing other EDUs. I had to completely rebuild the network and PXE server from scratch. My favorite part about that was I started to install Ubuntu on Macs instead of OSX and the first weeks those were out on the sale floor, you would have thought you killed the Mac fan boys' mothers. I'm pretty sure I actually heard one scream. \n\nThat was probably one of my best jobs at ISU and have fond memories of it. My other one was IT Support for the College of Mechanical University in Black from fall of 05 to winter of 08.",

The garbage can was always full of drives. But that was before monitor recycling was a thing, once every couple weeks the dump truck would show up and we\u2019d pitch all CRTs into it. We did eventually ship all the monitors to a recycler in STL.\n\nWas ML still running Surplus when you worked there? He had just taken over when I started. Good times, working in the warehouse, I still regularly talk to a guy that also worked computers back in the day. And it was always fun to get out on the truck for some pick ups. Sale days were insanely busy for the first 15-30 min",

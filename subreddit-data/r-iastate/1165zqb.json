If you are living in ISU housing, I would skip the RA and speak directly with housing (preferably in person) in Friley and let them know you want to move to a different dorm/apartment. You don't even need to explain. ISU housing will let you know of open housing options for you to move to. If you stay within ISU housing, it won't cost you anything unless you move to a more expensive room, and if you move to a cheaper room, you will get some money back.\n\n  \n I was in a similar situation and wished I had done this sooner. Instead, I tried to work with the roommate and ultimately ended up wasting my time/sanity. \n\n  \n I am sorry this is happening to you, and I wish you the best of luck!",

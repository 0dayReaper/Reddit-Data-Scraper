I've filled out my map quite a lot over the years, I believe I have some miis from Japan and Ireland.\n\nThere are also games you can play and the characters level up based on how many times you have streetpassed them. Its fun to look back on since of course all of my high level fighters are from high school.\n\nBe sure to quickly buy anything you want from the eshop! It closes on the 27th!",

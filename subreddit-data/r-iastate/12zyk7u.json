    "postText": "Hey guys,\nI'm a returning student and I plan to take 166 over the summer. \n\nI'm assuming the only difference between the face to face section and the online section, is how they deliver the lecture.\n\nDo they deliver the quizzes, exams differently by any chance? Are there any other differences between the two?",

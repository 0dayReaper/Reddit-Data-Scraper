A few of them are third party recruiters for financial institutions in SoCal. Once I said Iowa State they said they love interviewing and hiring students from here since they are always nice and have good work ethics. One of the big reasons why I decided to come here for school.",

I think it's pretty obvious based on the top schools that this is kind of an academic popularity contest, and it measures people's top choice (that they got accepted at). Another way of saying that is that high scorers aren't a 'safety school' for a lot of people. One factor that could influence the data is that Iowa uses the same acceptance criteria for all its public universities, so fewer people apply to all of them. \n\nBut the reason ISU has 6 points on Iowa would probably have to do with popularity/public perception (which could be tied to a lot of things) or because they have a reputation within specific majors that makes them a top pick. I can't really say more than that, but that would be my interpretation of the chart.",

So not exactly budget; there's still quite a bit of talent and responsibility here, just a slightly cheaper price tag. And that's not even considering the vet school here. Veterinary generally is a pretty difficult major to get into, so if you got in, you'd probably go with the place that offered it.",

Plus a great engineering department with excellent faculty and \u201creasonable\u201d tuition does help. But from what I\u2019ve experienced, it\u2019s extremely hard to get out with an engineering degree. About a third of my peers from my graduating class dropped engineering a few semesters into it. I think it\u2019s the same with a few other colleges like Purdue and Michigan state, easy to get in, but hard to get out successfully.",

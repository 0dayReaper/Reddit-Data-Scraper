From what I heard, the professors for Econ 101 aren\u2019t the greatest but they are okay enough to understand the class. However it is an easy enough class to get an A in with a little bit of studying. \n\nI had Irene Jacqz. She was ok and I think she was new. Easy weekly online quizzes and 4 tests. Big curve. I had a B- but ended up with an A",

For valid reasons I'll grant. \n\nAll he has are quizzes and tests, and his lectures are no help for them.\n\nHowever I never paid attention in class. Instead I just looked through the PowerPoint on canvas briefly before the quizzes and did well.\n\nThe tests are easier than the quiz imo. They give the answers to 10 of the 40 questions before the test and most of the other questions are from the previous quizzes.\n\nIf you read the PowerPoint notes it should be an easy A, since the class only requires you to get an 82% or above for an A.\n\n\nGood luck",

Seemed like a good teacher if you actually go to class, but i'll give a word of warning: if you struggle with attention issues, he will make you suffer. I have ADHD and it was a hell of a struggle sometimes lol. He's a rather dry lecturer in a rather boring class IMO, YMMV. Good teacher though, if you can make it through.",

It is not the dramatic animal testing you see videos of, it is testing new types of treatment for animals in vet medicine. So like if a dog has arthritis they may test a new human arthritis medicine to see if it's effective for dogs and at what dose. Or a dog in heart failure may get a type of pacemaker that hasn't been used on dogs yet\n\nAny new type of treatment for animal medicine requires testing. Please do not trust PETA, they have no understanding of this kind of stuff they just think all of it is bad. Personally I'm glad animals can live longer because we try new types of treatments to help them",

I forget which year it was but somewhere in Bush's second term, cuz it was after I graduated ISU but before I hopped jobs.  They had to destroy most of the chickens in Iowa and were doing the incineration at Ames.\n\nIf you go drive around Dallas county, like around Adel and Dallas Center, you can still see chicken quarantine zone signs up that were never taken down.  It was a big deal.\n\nI think it was the same year the recycling company on East MLK by the SE 14th Street bridge in Des Moines burned, whenever that was.\n\n\\-----\n\nBesides, \"seeing it from Des Moines\" isn't that much of a feat.  The main NADC building is so big you can see it itself on a very clear day from the Elkhart exit.",

There's also testing on mice, rats, pigs, sheep, cows, chickens, rabbits, ... etc. Much of it is focused on agricultural or veterinary research. ISU also uses animals as a model for human physiology because, well, you can't experiment on humans.\n\nEvery single study is subject to ethical review by IACUC (institutional animal care and use committee) and will face push-back and even rejection if it's deemed unnecessary to use animals. \n\nBasically, PETA is a piece of shit organization that loves to pry people's pets out of their hands, but they're right that ISU does research on dogs and cats and other animals. All of that research is done under a lot of ethical scrutiny and isn't done willy-nilly.",

As others have said, there are rules in place to make sure this is done as humanely as possible. There is a national regulatory board, [IACUC](https://www.aalas.org/iacuc) and researchers have to lay out every step of the procedures, how they're housing and feeding the animals, how they're providing pain relief, etc. They also have to prove that the research question they're trying to answer cannot be done without the use of the animal model and that their method is the most pain-free and ethical way possible to carry out the experiment. It's very strict and if someone is found in violation of any of their rules I think ISU as a whole could lose its ability to have research animals so it is taken very seriously by researchers and admin at the university.",

            "comment": "The short answer is yes, but PETA is guilty of gross oversimplification. First off, yes, many research labs test on mice, dogs, pigs, and other types of animals. Iowa State has a facility that raises these animals and breeds them for the express purpose of research.  You can look up the Laboratory Animal Resource facility, they have a website: https://www.research.iastate.edu/laboratory-animal-resources/\n\nYou should also know this is an incredibly common thing in the field of medical research, and it doesn't look anything like the scary images from movies. It's much more boring, involving a ton of paperwork. Universities have an Institutional Review Board that has to approve proposals for anything involving live subjects, even those random psych studies you can sign up for. ISU specifically has the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) that approves animal research. \n\nHere's an example of a paper from ISU with an animal testing component if you want an example: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2019.10.016\n\nhttps://www.compliance.iastate.edu/committees/iacuc\n\nEvery grad student at Iowa State takes an ethics course that outlines this. In mine, we had someone from the LAR come talk to us, and they really don't take it lightly.",

To quote them \u2018Mixture.\u2019 The Atlantic pointed out the disturbingly high euthanasia rates, and so did Newsweek. Snopes also reported on instances in which PETA employees were arrested, although not charged, for stealing people\u2019s pets. They also referenced the case of a chihuahua, where PETA employees attempted to coerce the dog off of the family\u2019s porch, then, when that failed, grabbed the dog right off of the porch themselves. When the family later contacted PETA, after reviewing security footage to find out what had happened, they informed the family that the dog had been euthanized. In this case, PETA was found guilty and fined $50,000. \n\nAs mentioned in the Atlantic, Snopes, and pretty much all of the sources, I think. PETA has an issue with euthanasia. They have very high euthanasia rates for a group that claims to protect animals. So much so, that according to NBC12, the Virginia senate passed a law to clarify that animal shelters exist to find pets a permanent home. \n\nhttps://www.nbc12.com/story/28699856/euthanasia-controversy-sparks-new-law/\n\nHowever, in my view, it seems that PETA is all about the appearance and not about results. They pay people to make posts on social media about using a term for an animal in reference to a human behavior, is derogatory to animals and perpetuating that \u2018humans are superior to other animals.\u2019 For example, calling someone who is acting in a cowardly fashion \u2018chicken.\u2019 \nMeanwhile, they\u2019re euthanizing 80% of the animals that they took in\u2026. Seems somehow off to me. So, let me get this straight PETA, it\u2019s derogatory toward the animal to call a human a insult relating to animals, but it\u2019s perfectly fine to kill them. Ok. I\u2019m surprised that PETA doesn\u2019t advocate for human euthanasia, since they euthanize animals and consider humans to be on the same footing as animals. But, I digress.\n\nAs far as the other two go, yes, they are paid marketing, but that doesn\u2019t make what they say to be a lie. It\u2019s sort of like auto insurance companies saying that a disproportionately high amount of accidents occur due to texting while driving and excessive speed, so you should download our app to that tracks your driving habits to get a better rate. ProtectTheHarvest interviewed a former PETA employee, allegedly. Maybe, she wasn\u2019t really a former PETA employee. I don\u2019t know.\n13NewsNow claims she is. Are they actually a news agency? Also, why is she in Honduras? I don\u2019t know the answers to these things. \n\nhttps://www.13newsnow.com/amp/article/news/local/former-peta-employee-calls-group-deceptive/291-418016794\n\nLook, I think that both of us want what\u2019s best for animals. You may think that PETA is a force for good in this regard. I think that what they say and their slogans are good, but in action they are not a force for good. You have your opinion on PETA and I have mine.",

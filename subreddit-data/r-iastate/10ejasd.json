    "postText": "How do you guys find apartments available before August 1st? I need to find a new place thats available at the beginning of May but almost all of the places that fit my budget and needs are not leasing until August 1st. I've also reached out to places and they've all told me no openinings until that day. Subleasing is also not good because I'm living with my fiancee with multiple pets.",

            "comment": "Look for places that are owned by individuals as opposed to property management companies. In my experience, they\u2019re more flexible, and also more likely to have a different start date to begin with. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t discount subleasing, usually subleasing has the same rules as straight up renting the apartment and there are definitely single family apartments/homes (with no roommates) that people are looking to sublease.\n\nFacebook groups and marketplace seem to be the best place to look for housing in Ames.",

If you search in the facebook groups, a lot of times people post subleasing options there which is mostly same as normal leasing but it depends place to place. Most of the time they will let you renew the lease around July. You may not find your ideal choice to rent through subleasing.",

I live on the SE side of Des Moines and my commute is never more than a hour. Ankeny would probably be the best choice in terms of commute distance, but like most suburbs, there isn\u2019t much to do without driving across town.",

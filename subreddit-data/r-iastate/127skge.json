But they may fire off just West/Southwest of us so please stay alert.\n\nAlso, please give friends and family in these bubbles a heads-up. Doesn't need to be a full forecast breakdown or anything panicky, just something to tip their mind towards safety.\n\n[Storm Prediction Center](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/)\n\n[National Weather Service DSM Twitter](https://twitter.com/NWSDesMoines?s=20)",

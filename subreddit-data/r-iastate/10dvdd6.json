            "comment": "I\u2019ve only taken ME 280x but it\u2019s a pretty fun class. Only five assignments that ranged anywhere from 3-10 hours in the amount of time it took to complete. Lots of guest lecturers presenting their research and it\u2019s relation to CPS.   I\u2019d say the CPS minor would be better for mechatronics for an ME major but both would be good. I think that the CPS minor only requires one additional class combined with the  mechanical engineering major as two of the classes can count as tech electives.",

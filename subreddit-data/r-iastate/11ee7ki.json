            "comment": "Took Calc 1 over summer 2022. Would not advice. I don't know if it's still like this but I had anywhere from 1-6 mymathlab hw assignments. And each could have from 15-30 questions each. The hints weren't always very intuitive.\nLecture was just a video of the professor giving lecture material, help hours were limited but you can email them your questions and my instructor was really helpful\nExams were just a pdf. Time limit was two hours but our instructure let us know he had no way of enforcing it so \"use the honor system\".\nI did an internship and took care of my daughter so the time I could dedicate to Calc 1 was limited and I didn't get to absorb the information I needed to for Calc 2 so that was a step backwards.\nResults may vary, everyone says just take it at dmacc.",

You had to download/ print them out, do the exam or quiz, then upload it as a pdf. Having an ipad with goodnotes made it super easy to do this. They were timed as well. The exams and quizzes would open at a specific time and close at a specific time. We had to finish them and submit them within the time window. Over the class wasnt bad. A bit accelerated but was an easy A. The only part i didnt like was taking it over summer (of course).",

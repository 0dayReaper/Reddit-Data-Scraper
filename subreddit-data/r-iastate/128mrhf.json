            "comment": "I took the test two years ago and from what I remember I had to write a mini essay (maybe 500 words) in response to a statement arguing for something related to higher education (I can't remember if I could choose from a list or if I was just given one). I believe there was a brief summary assignment too.\n\nFor the spoken part, I had respond to a few open-ended questions related to education and summarise the main points of a recording. I think I then had to argue for the opposite side of the argument afterwards. \n\nI'm sorry if this is not a very detailed explanation (and I may be misremembering some of it), but I hope it helps you get some sense of what to prepare. I wouldn't worry too much because the goal of this test is to determine where you're currently at in terms of English proficiency.",

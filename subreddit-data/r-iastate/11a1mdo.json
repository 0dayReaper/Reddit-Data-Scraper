    "postText": "Hello, first off I want to apologize for creating another dorm post I know there are tons  but a lot of the old ones were from like 2020,2021 which was the year for covid which was a pretty different era socially and everything. I was just wondering what is everyone's opinion on the best dorm? I personally would like a more social dorm for sure. I also applied for honors so depending on if i get accepted that is also an option. Also while at the subject, what is better, a traditional dorm or a suite. Or even the singles? Thanks much appreciative",

            "comment": "I loved in Helser and whenever we would have people over from other dorms they would comment on how social we were. I think this is due to having no AC. It sucks for the first 3-4 weeks but you suffer with the people on your floor and it makes for easy conversation starters because you have something in common with those around you. Almost all of my frends are form Helser or from a Helser party. your right next to the biggest bus stop and its easy to walk to class if your an engineer. I wasn't but it was still nice.",

I met some really good people on my floor and met one of my best friends because he lived down the hall from me. Another plus was it being within a 10-minute walk to all of my classes that year and two dining centers right next door. MacDonald was a good fit, and it just so happened to be right below where my dad stayed. We like family traditions I guess.",

            "comment": "From my knowledge, maple-willow-larch seems to be a pretty social dorm community. However, a big part of it is that the campus is so big, that MWL is pretty far from classes, and the bus that comes by fills up very quickly. A dorm like Friley would probably better location wise, but I don\u2019t know too much about it otherwise. I lived in Oak-Elm and it was super quiet and not very social, but is nice because it is smaller. In terms of suites vs singles vs regular, I think that it mostly comes down to money. A suite or a single is gonna be significantly pricier than a traditional style dorm. But if you have rich parents, that shouldn\u2019t be a problem\ud83d\ude02personally I think as a freshman a traditional styles is best and can help you meet people through your roommate.",

I joined mine and its been fantastic, i made a floor of friends and you can all help each other on  assignments. Its a great way to build that sence of community/belonging.\n\nI digress back to dorms, so since i picked mine Im living in Willow and theyre good dorms, they dont look outdated, the ac situation is ok, you can control well (ac or heat (60-80)).\n\nThe showers are fine, the preasure is like using a hose, pretty hard at first but you get used to it, doesnt get hot, above warm at best.\n\nDining, Seasons is literally an elevator ride down, food decent and if youre looking for a job theyre always hiring and its convenient, at least i did.\n\nParking, if youre bringing a car GET A LOT PASS they sell out quick if not ull be stuck parking in Stadium and it sucks having to walk \n\nLocation, its not too far from campus about 10-15 min walk at most, theres an Orange and Blue stop, Orange is the goat.\n\nSingle/Shared Room,\nDepending on your roomate and yalls set up this is a wild card, some of my friends roomates either are always in their room, never in there some theyre civil with some just butheads",

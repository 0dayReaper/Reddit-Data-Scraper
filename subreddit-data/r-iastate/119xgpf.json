Here's the full text of the email:\n\n-----\n\nFebruary 23, 2023\n\nDear Iowa State Community, \n\nDue to the icy conditions yesterday that continued overnight, classes will be held virtually, when possible, and employees should work remotely on Thursday, Feb. 23.\n\nStudents please look for additional class information from your instructors. Employees who do not have the option to work remotely should contact their supervisors and arrange to make up the time or take leave.   \n\nSupervisors in police, public safety, security, power plant, food service, animal care and critical maintenance should make arrangements for team members to report safely to campus.  \n\nWendy Wintersteen, President\n\nJonathan Wickert, Senior Vice President and Provost\n\nToyia Younger, Senior Vice President for Student Affairs\n\nShawn Norman, Senior Vice President for Operations and Finance\n\nKristi Darr, Vice President for University Human Resources",

Which creates a whole new set of challenges in coordinating 700 students and multiple large classrooms in a short amount of time. It would also mean having people learn new material while studying for the exam.\n* Modify the way that the course was set up and remove one exam. This puts more weight on one exam, but would not otherwise interfere with the flow of classes or study plans of students.\n\nNeither option was desirable, but in the end the second option seemed to be the one that could best serve the students, or perhaps we could say that would do the least harm.\n\nI understand that students are worried about having one large exam. We will be more transparent about the nature of what questions will be on the exam (so very few surprises) and the questions themselves will tend to be more straightforward. In particular, I will personally avoid adding \"flavor\" to the exam problems.\n\nOur goal is still to get as many people successfully through the course as possible.",

How can I make the most out of Starbuck as an honors ME freshman? Any advice and suggestions would be incredibly appreciated.",

I found friends through the learning community (the learning community setup was a little dumb imo but it was a great way to meet people). Also if you can befriend your roommates (if you don't know them already) then that helps",

Do your best to force yourself to socialize with people during the first month even if it is difficult. It is totally worth it. Some of my fondest college memories coke from living there.",

If you\u2019re not a \u201cband kid\u201d (as in *that* kid in band; not all kids who do band are band kids), you\u2019ll struggle to fit in with the common-room crowd\u2014 or maybe you won\u2019t even have a desire to. Most of the other people on the floor were pretty cool though.",

You should definitely be able to make friends, just try to hang out in common areas for the first week or so, and you\u2019ll start to make friends. Plus with any luck your suite mates will be potential friends too. If you don\u2019t end up making friends within your floor you can always join clubs and learning communities too. \n\nAlso, someone else expressed they didn\u2019t fit in with the \u201cband kid\u201d honors kids, if that\u2019s something you\u2019re worried about just don\u2019t hang out with those people, there are plenty of different types of kids, from different backgrounds, you just have to be willing to socialize with them. \n\nJust remember you\u2019re not the only one looking for new friends!",

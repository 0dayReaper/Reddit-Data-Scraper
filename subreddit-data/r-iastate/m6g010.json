Especially the ones where you have to show your room constantly and that have the background process trackers etc. Even one of my professors called out the use of stuff like that. Maybe just don't copy your exam questions from quizlet  or Word for word from the textbook and actually write a good conceptual exam? (Some professors are great at exam writing, but some totally just Google relevant questions, or reuse old exams)",

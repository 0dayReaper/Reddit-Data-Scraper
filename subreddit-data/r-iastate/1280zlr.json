    "postText": "Hey everyone I\u2019m looking for EE tech electives as I go into senior year. I have to keep my course load low stress so I\u2019m looking for courses that were either fun or relatively easier. Right now I\u2019m in between EE 465 or 414 and 411 for my sequence. I have been looking at 333 and 451 as well. \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "EE414 is one of my favorite courses I took as an undergrad. I did not think it was too difficult, and as long as you do the assignments and don't get behind in the lab, it is pretty easygoing. EE333 is also a great course where you learn to build things using your stuff from 201 and 230. I did not take it, but everyone I have talked to that took it really liked it. I found all the power engineering classes I took to be pretty boring (all theory, no application), but they were online during the pandemic when I took them. The homework for these classes can be really long, but I thought the exams were pretty easy.",

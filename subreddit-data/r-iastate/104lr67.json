I do know that Costco usually has more protein and supplements available year round. But Sam\u2019s also has a large selection of meats, rice, veggies ect. Also to note, Sam\u2019s club has an app with scan and go. Which makes bulk shopping a lot easier. Costco on the weekends gets super busy no matter what time of day and you\u2019ll be waiting in a line for the majority of your trip.",

If you're looking to get in bulk, good choice. Full discl: My experience is with Costco in NJ a few years back. If you have time, you can go check it out and wander around.",

While you have to buy items in ridiculous quantities, the value is much higher than shopping at target, Walmart, etc. it has everything you need. It\u2019s also a good place to buy milk, and even gas, as they are cheaper there.",

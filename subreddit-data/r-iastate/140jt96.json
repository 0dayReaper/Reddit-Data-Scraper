One is Trent Muhr and the other is Feifei Cheng, and I assume they are both graduate students. Does anyone have a recommendation? \n\nAlso, this is my first summer class. Are there live lectures with required attendance? Thanks",

I know that Trent has taught summer courses before (not sure about Feifei), like 227 and 228, so that might be a reason to go for Trent, maybe?\nIdk anything about lectures in the summer, but I doubt the attendance will be mandatory.",

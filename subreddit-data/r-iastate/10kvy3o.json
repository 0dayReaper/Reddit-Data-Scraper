    "postText": "Hey All, \n\nI am an international student starting my Ph.D. program in May this is my first time in Ames. Yesterday, I received an email from the housing department stating that I can't sign a contract for the University er village which it was my option. They limited my choices to the halls only. I am looking for a private room quiet and clean where I can concentrate on my study and workload. Could you please recommend anything that help me to find a place to stay before coming to Ames. \n\nThanks in advance.",

I would double check with them to see if you could be in university village in the fall. There are lots of people who sublease their rooms off campus over the summer, so you would get the individual room and usually bathroom to yourself as well.",

One good group to join is the \u201cIowa State University (ISU) Housing, Sublets &amp; Roommates\u201d group. How the sublease or lease assumption works will vary by person or apartment complex. People will post about their apartment or room and you can just reply in the comments or message them directly about it.",

If not The Grove and I believe some other apartments in the area allow you to rent the apartment by the room so a 2 or 3 bedroom apartment but you\u2019d get a private room with a lockable door. They may have someone else in one  or more of the rooms but you still have a lockable room and bathroom that\u2019s just yours. Sometimes you may also get lucky and they won\u2019t assign you anyone and you\u2019ll get a cheap solo apartment.",

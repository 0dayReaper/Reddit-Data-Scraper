Just find something out there will good reviews that fits whatever form factor you'd want and had the connectivity you'd need. What I would suggest considering is getting something that you can interface with a laptop dock, a laptop stand, and an external monitor, so you could set it up as a pseudo dual monitor setup at your dorm desk, while still having the laptop portability.",

I'm sure that mechanical engineering students especially would lean towards Windows. \n\nFor me as an EE student, I just don't find that there are a lot of disadvantages to having a Macbook. The heavy-duty software that we need to use at a junior- and senior-level won't run well on a laptop unless I'm willing to shell out the money for a gaming laptop, which is kind of a scam (speaking as an enthusiast nerd). I personally find that it's really important to have a laptop for taking notes on campus and a desktop for the CAD software at home. By the time I was using that software, I was living off-campus and had space for a desktop, so it wasn't as important for me to be able to run it on my laptop.\n\nI value easy iMessage communication with group chats for clubs and group projects. I can see why that wouldn\u2019t be as high of a priority for some people, though. We\u2019ve all got different needs.",

The productivity gains from being able to look at 2 things at once without it getting awkwardly small has been amazing.\n\nHaving a homework pdf open on one monitor and Matlab on the other, or having a window for documentation searching open, or playing Minecraft during a zoom lecture...\n\nIf my desk was big enough I'd have a third monitor by now!\n\nIt is also a big drag on productivity and procrastination to have to set up your laptop every time you have to do something.

            "comment": "Fun fact: Iowa state actually has a webpage specifically for your question, with some navigation you can even find a list of recommended computer specs organized by major.\n\nhttps://www.it.iastate.edu/resources/requirementfaq\n\nBetween the site and my personal experience:\nDefinitely bring a laptop, I say it makes life easier to work wherever you are instead of waiting till you're back in your room. You can certainly bring a desktop if you'd like but it's not necessary.\n\nI'm in mechanical so I don't know if any CAD is in your curriculum but as an engineering major there might be. So you may want to consider having something with good enough specs to run CAD software, but if you don't it's no sweat, you can just use one of the many computer labs on campus",

The price is about the same as buying it elsewhere but you avoid paying sales tax and get a decent warranty.",

Honestly I prob didn't need a specific \"gaming laptop\" but I had some extra scholarship money so eh \n\nThere is a gaming room in Beyer hall with PC's, playstation, xbox, etc., but the list of games is limited I think, so it would depend on what you play.

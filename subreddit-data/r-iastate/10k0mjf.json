I\u2019m also planning on doing an internship over the summer, so I\u2019m curious to know how much time I should expect to spend on the class and if it will be overly stressful to do along with an internship.",

            "comment": "I took physics thru IWCC. It was easy, but idk how much I retained from it. Generally, I think there was a quiz/exam and a \"lab\" due each week. Both didn't take that much time. The latter involved using a simulation software that is probably 40 years old and recording data from manipulating various sliders. So, while you can definitely pass with minimal effort each week, it may be fruitful to take some extra time to study the topics on your own during any lulls in your internship (in the event you go with iwcc).",

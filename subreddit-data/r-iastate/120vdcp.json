            "comment": "Former math major here, I have taken taken most of these classes so here are my thoughts; I don\u2019t think any of the classes are \u201ceasy\u201d but some are more interesting to me than others. I highly recommend taking taking abstract algebra or number theory. I also recommend geometry even though I don\u2019t see it on the list here. Complex variables was just calculus with imaginary numbers which was fun but I also think it depends on the professor. Analysis was rough and it\u2019s a rigorous approach to calculus. Partial differential equations is a tough time as well. Intro to probability and statistics was the most boring class to me but that is because I\u2019m not a big fan of the subject area. I am biased towards these classes because Of the experience I had in them so take this with a grain of salt.",

Although I have attempted to self study some graph theory. I found the vocabulary to be a bit overwhelming. And I know next to nothing about Combinatorics besides that it is the study of counting and ordering while graph theory is the study of graphs and their properties. I recommend just asking yourself which class you\u2019d be more interested in or if either would be more applicable to your main area of study. I would also recommend finding a textbook on both topics in the mini library in carver hall. Read the intros and see which subject catches your eye better.",

I am biased because algebra is my favorite subject, but I think it is all around an incredible course to help you get to understand more about how math is actually done and thought about. I know Jonas Hartwig is teaching it next semester and I would highly recommend him (I had him for math 504 and 505). Best of luck!",

            "comment": "Thought I'd add tk what others said even though it's late (assuming you've signed up for classes already).\n\nMath 424 was fairly easy, and I overall really enjoyed it, but I was a CS major too and had a lot of programming experience - the class teaches introductory python in the context of math problems at first, but ramps up very quickly in terms of programming and you end up doing C / c++ by the middle of the semester. There weren't any exams, just coding assignments in a \"lab\" setting twice a week, then a final project/presentation the last few weeks. Sometimes  assignments would take quite a while even after working on them in lab, so it became somewhat time consuming -but it was not hard to get an A if you went to class and did them. I mostly struggled with some of the assignments that imemented calc3/ linear algebra type problems since I hadn't taken those for 2 years.  \n However in terms of math it felt super easy compared to MATH 481, which also involves some programming. I dropped that after week 1 or 2 because I didn't remember enough from taking calc3/diffeq during the pandemic and it jumped straight in. 481 might be a better choice than 424 if you are more interested in something like using Matlab / python to solve more advanced diffeq problems and applying it to something like engineering/science for example? Appeared to be a lot easier in terms of coding, but much more upfront math knowledge than 424\n\n341 was not bad, labs + homework weekly to do, again, requires time consistently but content didn't feel bad. It appeared to be harder than like stat 330 or 305 based on what I saw from friends but can't say for sure.   \n\nGraph theory is a pretty interesting class, learned quite a bit, proofs felt more \"straightforward\" than some other classes, but still definitely not an incredibly \"easy\" class I wouldn't say. not sure about combinatorics.  Number theory is really interesting, but honestly I couldn't wrap my head around it personally most of the time, and did poorly (also didn't put enough effort in though). It felt a lot different than any of the above classes to me (graph theory was a lot of proofs too, but felt much more familiar conceptually  after cs 311/331 ) . I've heard it is much easier to grasp if you have taken things like abstract algebra and analysis,  but no clue since I didn't take those, and it wasnt taught with those as \"prerequisites\" or anything. Very interesting, but just felt like the proofs were a lot different from every  other proof class I had taken like COMS 230/331/311/math 317/314 and I was not great at it, but I bet most found it easier than I did.\n\nThat's really most of what I can speak to here, I did the math+applications which it looks like you're doing(?), And I personally just went for the ones cross listed with COMS, but I think 301 and 414 are probably at least two of the really \"fundamental\" math major classes I skipped out on, that I maybe should have taken to really learn math to a greater extent(from what I know at least).",

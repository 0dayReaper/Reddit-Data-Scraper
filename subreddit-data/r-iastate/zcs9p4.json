Wishing the best for the kid - we'll see how he does after Tampa Bay has a week to prep for him.\n\nI will say I was SUPER impressed with his ability to hang in the pocket and deliver passes while getting smoked. Did well enough against the cover 0 blitzes Miami was bringing once he was in to force them back into normal coverage. That's gotta feel good.",

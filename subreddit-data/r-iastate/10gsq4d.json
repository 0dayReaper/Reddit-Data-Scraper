    "postText": "Dang, I was almost finished posting when the page refreshed so now I have to retype the whole thing. \ud83d\ude43\n\nBasically I know I have two wisdom teeth coming in for my top set of teeth. Only 2 wisdom teeth for me! YAY! \n\nWas supposed to see an orthodontist during winter break, however they no longer take my insurance which is medicaid, they were sweet enough to tell me the day before my appt of this change. I stupidity stopped thinking about it as about a year ago was when I began to feel pain associated with the wisdom teeth. However, by the time of my supposed appt, the pain had subside. Thought I was in the clear. \n\nWell starting yesterday I noticed that one of the areas where one wisdom tooth might come out was tender. I didn't think much of it, during my morning brush I saw my toothbrush had a bit of blood but I that whatever for some reason. \n\nTonight when I brushed my teeth I went over the tender area, without thinking. Blood came out, it wasn't gushing out but I was alarmed at the amount. When I rinsed my mouth with water it came out red. It took a few minutes of rinsing for the water to turn clear.\n\nI panicked. I googled. Obviously this isn't normal but everytime I call a denist office and they hear what my insurance is they say they won't see me. I've even offered to pay with money. I'm not sure what to do, the only places that accept my insurance are community centers that offer dentistry, if I'm not wrong there like 2 in the state of Iowa. I don't have a car, and if it is something like having to get my wisdom teeth removed I don't know any orthodontist that would accept my insurance.\n\nIs there really no place I can go? I know im not dying or anything but the blood just freaked me out. Can dentist really just turn me away? Does anyone know what I can do? My concerns with community centers are the distance and the wait list, one of them I called over break and they where booked for a few months. I willing to pay out of pocket to seen. \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude23\n\nEdit: I want to give thanks to everyone who commented! I made an appt with Primary Care as they are cheaper and close by. \n\nHowever, I'm glad to know that there are many options, some that take medicaid or others like Somerset that won't turn me away!\n\nHonestly, I was really discouraged because I had been turned away so many times, I guess I called everyone who didn't take my insurance first, lol. Thanks again everyone! May everyones dental health be well!!",

It's no surprise that the departments that bring in the most money also have the newest/shiniest buildings. The university I went to still has several brutalist buildings on campus. The engineering and business schools have amazing facilities while the departments that don't bring in the money have kept the old brutalist buildings that only a few people still appreciate.",

Some of the main colleges Iowa State is known for are Engineering, Ag, and Business, which all had new or renovated buildings in recent years. Design and human sciences are less recognized as being major colleges for Iowa State, so their facilities aren't as nice.",

I\u2019ve heard both classes take a bit of time and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019ll be able to manage both classes simultaneously along with my other gen ed classes and having a social life etc.",

Based on my experience and what I've heard from those who did take 288, both of those classes have a very high workload requirement. Assuming your other classes are on the easy side, this semester should be difficult but possible. You'll need to know your own limits here, since having to drop one of them would probably hurt your course planning a lot. If you have any doubts about whether this would work you should try to switch one of them for another course.",

Imo this is probably a good time for you to take 309 because taking ComS 309 with CprE 381 will be a lot harder if you delay it a semester.",

I have heard 381 has a bigger project at the end of the semester but I don\u2019t know much about it. It seems like 381 may focus on hardware a little more though.",

You might be pressed for time depending on what else you're taking but it's doable.\n\n288 you'll have labs every week and a final project once labs are finished. 288 tends to be easier in the beginning (if detect bump go backwards), but once you hit the PWM labs (translate duty cycle to distance) and such it gets a bit harder.\n\n309 you'll have to demo the progress of your semester long project a few times. So you can expect to work on it/coordinate with your team quite a bit during the week. Kinda hard to know when you'll have to commit more time to 309, it just depends on what your project is.",

There are so many projects in those classes that it was too much. However, I retook the class the next semester and got an A.  I did bad the first time mainly because I did not do a good job of getting help when I needed it. If you're going to do this, just make sure you use office hours if you have any problems with any topics. Also, I would say maybe combine these with gen eds and maybe a math class since none of those are going to have large projects.",

The final project is basically just putting together your code from the whole semester to get a final working product so make sure you invest time into creating quality code throughout the semester. As for 309, I worked on the backend which, in my opinion, was less time-consuming than the front end. I also had a great group that worked well together so it just wasn't a difficult time. It all depends on how well you time manage though. I was taking 319 as well and between the 3 classes, it was definitely a grind but doable.",

You might be overwhelmed by the data sheet at first but you'll get used to reading it pretty quickly. I didn't take it in the fall so I didn't have Jones so I can't speak to his teaching. \n\n363: This isn't a \"hard\" class, but it's definitely a different way of thinking. Utilize the Piazza and office hours when you need it and you should be perfectly fine. It's definitely a tedious class at times which can be annoying but overall it's good.\n\n319: When I took this class it was a lot of busy work and I didn't get too much out of it. However, it sounds like with the new prof it's taught a lot better and people are getting real value out of it which is great! It's not too difficult and won't take as much time compared to your other classes.\n\n309: Try to get into a good group and if you want to hate your life less, do backend. I took this class before one of my internships and I actually used a lot of the backend knowledge I picked up from 309. The documentation for both backend and frontend is outdated but backend is slightly less outdated. Android Studio (frontend) has a steep learning curve as well. However, it's really about what you want to work on at the end of the day so if your really want to do frontend, go for it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall: Your semester will definitely be a busy one, but that's kind of the whole vibe of junior year. Good luck!!",

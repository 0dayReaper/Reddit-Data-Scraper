The final project in that class is basically the LTA but utilizing fly-by-wire to apply the control theory it covers.  Focusing on good engineering rather than aesthetics was also a plus, as was working with a group of upperclassmen in a smaller class size.",

Plus, its not like the university didn't sanction \\*much\\* larger gatherings during the 2021/2022 school year.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, mission accomplished!! I just got back and I was definitely overthinking. I was literally the only person on the bus for the last 80% of the trip from campus to West Ames. I guess no one takes the bus Sunday nights so that was nice. Bus driver didn't care at all and was super nice like how usually CyRide drivers are. Pizza was good too! Just cold by the time I got home lol\n\nThank you everyone for responding to my original post and for your encouragement!\n\nDon't overthink like me, don't let not having a car stop you from getting your pizza! God bless CyRide for operating even on Sunday nights!",

Just wondering because last time I ordered from there the delivery fee was only a few bucks -- in my mind, definitely worth the time and trouble it would take to either take a bus or drive to dominos and pick it up myself and without one of those carriers the delivery people have to keep it warm.\n\nGranted, OP, it's a free country, so do what makes sense to you.  But for me delivery is worth it.",

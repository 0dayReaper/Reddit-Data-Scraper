    "postText": "So some of you might know the chess man who plays at the MU, North Grand and welch. I played him once at MU and yesterday at Welch. And he beat me everytime. I came home and started learning and grinding chess. \n\nI went to welch today hoping to see him again but unfortunately he wasnt there. I googled and found his name is David Skaar. \n\nI would probably try and go to welch for a few days at the same time seeing if he\u2019s there again but if any of you know him, I would be happy to get in contact and play some long games with him.",

            "comment": "As an active member of the chess club I know exactly who you are talking about, the Chess Mad Hatter (self given title). In the best way, he\u2019s like a video game NPC. He randomly \u201cspawns\u201d at various locations (Welch Ave, the MU, and the North Grand Mall). He has a distinct look (always wearing his yellow and green checkered hat). He has battle music (he always has his boombox with him and will play music out of it). He has a dialogue tree (not kidding, ask him about his favorite Bobby Fischer game and prepare yourself for a long lesson about the 21st game in the 1972 Chess World Championship, Fischer vs Spassky aka \u201cThe Game of the Century\u201d). Also, if you beat him at chess he has a chance of dropping loot (still not kidding). All this aside, he is genuinely passionate about chess and loves teaching people, best of luck finding him and playing against him again.",

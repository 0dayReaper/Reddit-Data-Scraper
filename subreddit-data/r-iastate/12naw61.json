To take it you should have COM S 336: \u201cIntroduction to Computer Graphics\u201d, but you might be able to still take the course without it if you speak to the professor.\n\n437 will need an adequate amount of people enrolled in the class to be offered, so please tell your friends if you decide to take it.",

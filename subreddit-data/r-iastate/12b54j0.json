TIA",

            "comment": "I took physics at IWCC is super easy. There was a weekly quiz and a weekly homework assignment + 3 exams and weekly labs. Everything was on chegg. Passed with an A. extremely easy.\n\nCalculus II at DMACC is a bit more work but not by much. There was 4-5 weekly homework assignments, around 15 questions each. I think there was 3-4 quizzes and 3 exams. The quizzes were easy as they were on chegg but the exams questions were not as the professor makes new exams every semester. Also passed with an A.",

You need to apply as a \"non-degree\" student at https://www.iwcc.edu/ and then you will be able to register for classes similar to how they do it here (not sure when summer registration starts). You may need to prove prerequisites for the courses but they usually just want to see your unofficial transcript from ISU. They use canvas for the courses too.",

This is seemingly happening with a route from Chicago to the Quad Cities and it could extend to Iowa City and Des Moines later, but a north/south route doesn't seem likely anytime soon sadly.\n\nThe biggest obstacles are probably our state government and freight rail issues which affect passenger service across the US. Do with that knowledge what you will. If enough people care about this it can happen someday.",

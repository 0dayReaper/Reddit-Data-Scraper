    "postText": "So ive been parked at SUV outside of my dorm since the beginning of the semester and have yet to recieve a fine. Ive noticed other cars have the permit stickers on their windshields, so I assume a permit is indeed required. Did I hit the jackpot (so far) or should I turn myself in and just buy the pass?",

            "comment": "Yes, parking permits are required for SUV. You would need a lot 201/202 tag to avoid getting a ticket. From what it sounds like, you lucked out so far. These lots are not frequently ticketed, but you will most likely eventually get one without a tag. I know full year stickers are $166, but there may be a reduced price for only one semester.",

The tag I got was reduced in price by half as well.\n\nThis is more than 7 years ago now iirc.",

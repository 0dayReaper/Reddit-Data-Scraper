Questions about system design are being asked in interviews, and MOST universities require distributed systems as part of the core curriculum due to its importance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow is Iowa State not offering them?",

There's a lot of classes on the catalogs that haven't been taught in a while. \n\nLooks like ComS 527 might be relevant to what you are looking for, along with CprE 450 (may be more hardware oriented). There are a few big data classes like CprE 414 that would likely be relevant. Some of these classes are under CprE since software systems is a CprE focus area.\n\nWe do have basic parallel computing taught in our OS courses: CprE308/ComS352, which is in the core curriculum.\n\nI don't see UIUC or UMichigan requiring a parallel algorithms course or anything beyond a systems programming course.\n\nI'm sure there's a better way to complain to the university than through reddit. You might want to look to see if it's possible to ask for classes to be re-added, but I think there are a lot of classes that will teach you adjacent (if not the same) skills that you are looking for from other classes.",

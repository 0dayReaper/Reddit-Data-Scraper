    "postText": " \n\nSo I am a sophomore student placed on academic probation because I didn't attend classes much last fall 2022 semester. Now I am in the spring 2023 semester, and even after attending classes, I cannot increase my GPA above 2.0, and Iowa State has a rule that the student has to stay away for one semester before reapplying. I don't know what to do except maybe appeal my academic dismissal (most probably, I will lose the case).\n\nSo, if I am academically dismissed, do I have to retake the passed courses too? And also since I am an international student, this academic dismissal will open a huge can of worms. Should I tell my parents? Also, will taking summer courses at a community college help me get back to college by fall?",

Taking courses at a community college when you are dismissed is fine, but keep in mind that transferring credits from a community college doesn't change the letter grade you received for the course, just marks it as passed, so in your case it would be recommended to retake the courses you did poorly in at ISU to recover your gpa. Also keep in mind that different departments have different ways of dealing with transfer credits, I know the COMS department specifically is a stickler and commonly WON'T accept transfer credits from ccs. And yeah, I would suggest speaking to your academic advisor as they have more specifics on your situation.",

            "comment": "I was academically dismissed after a couple of bad semesters after covid broke out. I\u2019m not an international student but I think the process of getting reinstated to the university is similar(talk to your advisor to make sure). I had to stay out for a semester and during that time I took some community college courses. To get reinstated I had to appeal to the college of engineering (you\u2019ll have to appeal to whatever college your in) with my community college credits as well as a written letter. I did up getting back in and am now graduating.\n\nIf you do end up getting dismissed, it is definitely not the end of the world, but a good learning experience. It will take some effort getting back, but there is processes in place that your academic advisor can communicate with you.\n\nBest of luck!",

My first semester back was my last one I needed to graduate and the time I spent away helped me get my shit together and prepare to do well in school.

Hit rock bottom moved home and I took an entire year and a half off to work a number of jobs and figure out what I actually want to do with my life. Completely reinvigorated me, went to community college, got my associates working full time and reapplied to ISU under a new major, accepted and graduated a year later. Helped to have a good support system but am three years out, started a family and on my dream job career path. Do not let this define you and you will find your way!",

Talking to your parents can also be helpful as well once you've talked to the advisor. \n\nSo sorry you've had a rough time.

I got a substantial amount of scholarships (above 10,000) in April as a freshman that definitely influenced my choice to attend Iowa State. Good luck!",

OneApp should give you recommendations for more specific ones that you can apply for, or you can flip through their whole catalog (\ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd72) to find ones that apply to your degree/field. Like I applied to a Cyber security one that I found while searching through their whole catalog",

But I heard back from WiSe, Walter and Lucille Murken, and the general scholarship application scholarship and LAS excellence scholarship. I haven't heard back from Lewis and Zeller Scholarship (pretty sure I didn't get it that's why). Think it just depends idk",

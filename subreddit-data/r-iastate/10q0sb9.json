FYI, curse is real, stepped on it purposely during a tour in high school, failed my geometry test.  It was supposed to be an easy test.",

Also, I'm not sure it can be pulled off, but if you can manage to get ahold of some corn on the cob and grill it, then do it.  \n\n\nFor stuff to do that hasn't been mentioned yet, there's the arboretum (weather depending), Living History Farms (and the Machine Shed, which is another great restaurant), the Des Moines botanical garden, and the Science Center could be an option.  \n\n\nAlso also, if you can make any state fair type food, that could be a stay at home type deal.",

Idk about food anymore, we never went to the Ox Yoke because a family member got bad food poisoning there way way back, but I'd imagine since it's like the only one left it probably got better.  The Millstream Brewing place is good to stop at, (not the haus one, the bar/original place), they had something like 22 beers on tap and their soda/root beer, which was all available for buying bottles to go.  The root beer is pretty good.",

There was weekly assignments, but they were mostly smaller pieces of the larger assignments, which would compile together into the major term assignments. I think overall, there was 3 or 4 reports that were made over the course of the semester, but they felt very manageable they were completed one piece at a time with feedback from the instructor and your classmates.",

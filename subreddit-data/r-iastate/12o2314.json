The only downside is you waste a lot of time talking to people in a house you know you don\u2019t fit in with.  As far was who to suggest it depends on what you\u2019re looking for.  If you\u2019re a student now I suggest going on instagram and messaging certain houses recruitment chairs and get a house tour.  DM me if you have more questions.",

During my time at Iowa State I was in a fraternity, I never experienced any hazing, aside from simple and (legitimately) harmless mind games. I did hear stories about some actual hazing going on in other houses, but those houses have since been kicked off campus. Iowa State is a pretty good school for Greek life, but it's not like what you see in movies or at SEC schools. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suggest going through the recruitment process, talk to multiple houses and try to find your fit.",

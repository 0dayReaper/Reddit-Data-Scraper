    "postText": "My friend and I submitted an on-campus housing contract on December 1st. Our only priority was UV housing. Today we got assigned to Linden hall.  \n\nWe are considering to cancel the contract and look for off-campus. I'm aware of the 14 day deadline to cancel, but I'm not clear whether it is \"14 days after submitting the contract\" or \"14 days after the room assignment\".\n\nAny clarification would be helpful.\n\nThanks.",

There is plenty of space available at UV for next year (fall23) so they might be able to help you out.\n\nIf you were looking for spring23, UV is full or near-full so that might explain why you didn't get the space",

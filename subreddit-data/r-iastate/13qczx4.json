Honestly they enjoy having other majors, as I was the only electrical guy in a group of mechanical guys. In my case, when compared to my EE senior design project the mechanical one consisted of much simpler electronics and coding, therefore it was a lotttt easier.\n\nActually, I don't think my group ever worked outside of class time as well since we got total team time. Definitely a plus.",

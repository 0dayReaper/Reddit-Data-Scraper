(Though for the college of design, accommodations aren\u2019t really possible to implement at all outside of exams).\n\nThe failing grades are due to attendance and not the projects themselves, which I do well within. \nIs there any advice on what to suggest? I\u2019m in touch with my advisor, but they have yet to respond.",

You might also be able to take an Incomplete grade in these courses if the attendance issues only happened partway through the semester (like if instead of missing a class every other week, you attended all the classes for a few months, then had a few weeks of not showing up) but that is heavily up to the instructor's discretion.\n\n^But ^again, ^different ^college, ^I ^don't ^know ^much ^about ^the ^design ^core, ^sorry",

I took an incomplete grade in, filled the design waiver (fortunately had it approved), and met up in person with my advisor and instructors for lengthy discussions. Though one my courses wasn\u2019t salvageable (received a D in), the other studio course I got a B in to slightly balance it out. \n\nI got notified on the first that I got accepted into my top choice for the my design major, so it went well regardless! However, I am in the process of scheduling with getting proper documentation during the summer; despite this new optimism and advanced planning.",

I have literally had the dean of students and another faculty member set up appointments for me after hearing my situation, and surprisingly that didn\u2019t help. I\u2019ve been denied twice and I wasn\u2019t approved until my very last semester after another diagnosis (although they told me apparently I had one I could use back in 2019 when they told me I was denied). If you\u2019re looking into getting accommodations, you\u2019re going to need as much documentation as possible to show them how badly your issues affect your ability to do work and attend classes. In most if not all cases you will need to get a doctor\u2019s note with them backing you on how your situation affects you academically. Hope you can get it figured out!",

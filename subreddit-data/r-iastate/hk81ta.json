That way, students have to stay in more expensive housing.\n\nThe university is also probably updating the language in housing contracts to waive any refund in the event the spring happens again.\n\nRemember: Never let a crisis go to waste!",

(For those wondering what the difference is, quarantine will be for those who have tested positive for COVID while isolation will be for those who have had contact with someone who was positive and are waiting on test results.) The DoR is having very little to do with both and they will mainly be run by whatever health team ISU has now.",

    "postText": "This doesn't involve me, but instead someone I know that I'm concerned about.\n\nThey recently had their appeal denied for the spring semester due to their grades in the fall.\n\nI was wondering how likely is an appeal denied when it's just over an academic warning, and what would be the possible reasons outside of grades? (Since they weren't provided any regardless of confrontation).\n\nI\u2019m overall concerned because they are now forced to go back to their home state. \n\nThis also confuses me since I was in the same position last semester with my GPA being a 0 (due to starting in the summer semester), but my appeal was granted shortly after submission while in academic warning. So it seems conflicting when their GPA isn\u2019t that low at all.",

            "comment": "Academic Warnings are not dismissal, Academic warning are just that, warnings. Letting you know hey, if you continue to do poorly we're going to put you on academic probation. If you're on Academic probation you have to meet a GPA requirement for the semester in order to not be dismissed from the university. If you're dismissed then you cannot register for classes until you have applied and been approved to be reinstated at iowa state. \n\nIf your friend was dismissed, applied for reinstatement but failed, they usually will tell you what they'd like to see more of from you. Usually that involves taking classes else where getting good grades at said class and then coming back. \n\nThe other reason why dismissal would happen would be misconduct, so like if your friend say... raped someone or assaulted a teacher ect, you'll get dismissed. Typically it's usually just for poor grades thou.",

I don't know your friend but going home and taking some time to reflect on what is important to them may not be the worst thing in times of challenge.\n\nI didn't go home and kept trying and trying and failing. I hit ROCK bottom. While I learned about hard work, I would not recommend doing academic or financial damage when things are not working. Sadly we need to figure ourselves out before going and embarking on these kinds of things. It could be that we just don't have all of the details. If you want to be a good friend, help them get whatever it is that can help them, even if that means a change in geography or mental health care near home to process what is happening. Helping them understand that this is common will be important to reduce stigma. I know for me I needed to hear other people's stories. [This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6x9wmlFz_c) in particular was helpful for me. Amazing how far we've come on the mental help discussion in 10 years. They probably feel very guilty and may be hard on themselves. Coming back later is an option. Finding a spot closer to support systems may be the best thing you can help them understand as a friend. Sounds like you are concerned which is really caring of you.",

I hope you are too\n\n\"I am afraid I will never find genuine happiness, because I have already realized that my mind was never created with that bone in store. It is not a structure to my being, and instead I thrive off of the depression fueling my broken half. But I do not approach the world cowering before the hate and darkness my blind eyes see. I walk into my problems with my head high, showing broken smiles, and endless stares because I can only do me, and failure is not fear filled when one can grow to accept defeat\"",

Though, I wonder if you and your friend are talking about the same type of warning.\n\nThere is an Academic Warning -&gt; Probation -&gt; Dismissal side of things academically.\n\nThere is also the Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Warning and Suspension. They may be connected but not necessarily. If someone is on SAP Warning or Suspension, an appeal is required to receive financial aid again.\n\nGenerally, if either appeal has been denied it's because the student has been able to show that their circumstances have improved and they are ready to have a successful semester. There are so many different scenarios, though. Hopefully your friend's academic advisor has been helpful in the process and/or figuring out the best next steps.",

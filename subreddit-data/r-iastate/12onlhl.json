Trying to sing and create a good atmosphere while he's shouting about hell isn't exactly easy.\n\nHe totally refused every single time tho. I believe he said he wasn't going to stop or be quieter because this \"was just his preacher voice\" and \"it's his right to say what he wants.\"\n\nI don't know what he thought he was gonna accomplish by shouting over us, because the entire crowd we gathered kept shooting him dirty looks (rightfully so tbh). \n\nIt's his right to say what he wants in that square, but that doesn't stop him from being a total dick to the performers there (who were scheduled a very long time ago). Could he not just be quiet and enjoy some music for 45 minutes lmao.\n\nThese people have no common sense or courtesy and I'm afraid they don't particularly care",

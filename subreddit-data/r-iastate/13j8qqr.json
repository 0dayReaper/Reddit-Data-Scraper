I put maybe 4 hours a week in, got a B+ and was happy.\n\nThen in 2021 the summer session was taught by the usual professor and it was like 20 hours a week of absolute hell for my friends in it.",

The class had an hour-long lecture everyday around 11am, and weekly or biweekly homework/assignments. I was able to concentrate on that one class by itself, and I think I got more out of it than what I would have during a regular semester.",

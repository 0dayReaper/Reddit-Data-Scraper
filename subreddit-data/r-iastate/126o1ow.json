    "postText": "I'm taking PSYCH 280 and planning to contract it as honors next semester. There are 3 sections (2 in person and 1 online). \n\nRobert Hessling teaches the in person ones, but there isn't a professor listed for the ARR class. Does anyone know if he also teaches the online PSYCH 280?\n\nI've heard great things about Prof Hessling, so I'd like to have him as a teacher. I'd also like the flexibility of an online class.\n\nIf anyone knows anything about how the class differs in person and online, or about contracting this particular class as honors, please share!\n\nThanks!!",

You will still learn the content from him but virtually.  The online section has a discussion post and test every week. The tests are straightforward if you watch the lectures.",

However, the weight of each exam is proportional to how well you do on them. Verbatim: \"Of the mid-term exams, your highest mid-term exam is worth 20%. The 2nd highest score on the mid-term exams is worth 15%, and the lowest midterm score is worth 10%.\" So that should be reassuring! Besides that, there's always those Learning Curve assignments, they've got curve in the name for a reason. It's too late to do them for extra credit points if you haven't already, but you can still study from them. Just do them, immerse yourself in the concepts and terminology, and you'll be fine! WE'LL be fine! We got this.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! Hope your spring semester is going as well as it can in the current state of slosh, snow, and dreaded ice that we are finding ourselves dealing with! The DOR sent out emails to those who applied for Resident Assistant positions, and I got my assignment. I\u2019ve heard that people put down preferences for what hall they would like to live in, but I can\u2019t recall going through that process during the application/interview rigmarole. I just got assigned a hall, and was wondering if they did away with the preferences, or if I just missed it like a fool? Regardless, I\u2019m very happy to have been accepted, and I hope my fellow applicants on here were just as lucky. Thanks for any input and stay warm, friends!",

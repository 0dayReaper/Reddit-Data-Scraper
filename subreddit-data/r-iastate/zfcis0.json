Verizon has the best coverage across campus, and I frequently am in dark basements of buildings servicing telecom equipment with cell service. The black poles by Friley/central campus with the loooong cylinders on top are small-cell Verizon towers. The only US cellular tower I'm aware of is the one north of the tracks by Freddy Ct.",

    "postText": "Stupid question but when registering for classes, does arranged mean its an online class? Or does it mean its yet to be determined? \n\nI am registering for a class thats dual S.S, and USD, but the only way to make it work was for it to be the arranged section. \n\nIs there a possibility that it will overlap with my other classes later down the line? \n\nThanks in advance",

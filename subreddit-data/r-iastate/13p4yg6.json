    "postText": "Hey guys, hope everyone is having a good summer. I received a few emails today that are offering me a position for SI leader for Math 165 or Math 166 and was wondering if anyone has any experience being an SI leader for any classes and if they were still able to keep up on schoolwork? I am a second-year aerospace engineering major and will be taking 15 credits next semester so I'm guessing I'll have a lot of schoolwork to do, and my main concern is if I'll have enough time to get it done while also being an SI leader. Is there anyone who has been an SI leader before and could share their experience with time management? Thanks!",

            "comment": "I think most SI leaders are students who just finished the course, this is due to courses always changing and having someone that just took it is the best way to make sure you are teaching information that is relevant and easy for you to understand / interpret for the students, If you want to work on your public speaking skills and also it looks really good on the resume I recommend highly trying it out, if you hate it you can always quit though I doubt you would",

I am comfortable with both classes but I don\u2019t know if it would be a good idea to SI for a course I\u2019m only one course higher than. Thanks for the reply",

I watched A TON of those lectures by Steve Butler which saved me in both calc classes so far. He\u2019s got a video for every lecture so any topic you\u2019re struggling with, you can look it up on YouTube and find Steve\u2019s lecture over it. Definitely recommend",

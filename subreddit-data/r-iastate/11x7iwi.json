    "postText": "Hello! I am an incoming phd student and am moving from across the country and looking for potential roommate(s); I am big into outdoorsy things such as hiking, birding, kayaking, foraging, etc. I am also an avid baker, and cook. I play a fair few board games (terraforming mars, twilight imperium, etc.). Those are just some of my hobbies that have hopefully sold me as a good/fun roommate.",

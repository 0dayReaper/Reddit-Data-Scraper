    "postText": "Im going to be a junior coming to Iowa State for Electrical Engineering next fall. I know that the coursework for engineering is time-consuming and that getting used to failure is a part of the major. So far, I have done well in my calculus and Physics courses. However, Im interested in studying Chinese, more particularly mandarin, and wanted to know if anyone has done this or if it is double. \n\nMy reason for studying Chinese is that my girlfriend is an international student from china, and I would like to speak to her parents when they come over for our graduation within the next two years. I have tried Duolingo in the past and have been able to do very basic conversational skills. Still, when exams start, I end up dropping my streak and feel I need to find another alternative to the app to be more accountable for studying the language.\n\nI would love to travel abroad to china during a summer semester next year, get immersed in the culture, and spend the summer in china with my girlfriend.\n\nIs it better to learn Chinese on my own and not risk my GPA or stress by taking a language course in a University setting?",

Of course no language is \"easy\" to learn, but Mandarin is especially difficult, because of how different it is from English (Non-romanized, non phonetic alphabet, along with there being no tenses in Mandarin). It would probably take much more the time to become equally proficient in speaking Mandarin than languages with Latin bases and an extremely long time to even understand basic phrases in writing that you would see in your day-to-day. With that being said, Mandarin is probably one of the most interesting languages in the world, because of it's rich history and how unique it is. I would not worry about GPA so much as the sheer time commitment it takes to learn.",

If their website doesn't have a suggested 4-year-plan you can ask one of the advisors. Not explicitly pertinent to you if you're not going to also major in Chinese Studies, but it could give you some idea of how to make the scheduling work.",

It helped double dipping 300 level electives and get through the international perspective requirement using actually interesting electives. Language courses are not a joke though is my warning, I went through all 3 years of high school German in the first 8 weeks of German 201. Taking usually at least one summer course every year was a must tho to fit in everything. Any questions let me know. I'd be happy to help.",

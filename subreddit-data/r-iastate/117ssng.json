            "comment": "I took PSYCH 301 with Dr. Tynan last semester, and I received an A for that class. The exams are multiple-choice, but sometimes there are some short answer questions. Honestly, the exams are not that challenging as long as you paid attention and studied the material. Dr. Tynan would normally give out study guides or a list of topics that are expected to be tested on on the exam. I would normally study the slides, and try to answer the study guide without referring to my notes. Basically, I would master all of the topics given on the study guide, and I would normally get an average of 35-38/40 for the exam. He also gave out extra credit opportunities by the end of the semester. \n\nYou\u2019ll do fine! Good luck.",

    "postText": "I recently graduated this December, received my diploma, and moved out of Ames. I lived at university village and they have been a few months behind in charging me my gas bill. This has caused me to be charged about $50 since I\u2019ve graduated. I don\u2019t plan to pay this since I am no longer a student there but was wondering if any negative repercussions could occur from this, i.e. lowering my credit score. Has anyone had any similar experiences? Should I just suck it up and pay it?",

They sound like legitimate charges for when you lived in the unit. The only thing related to you being a student is you are billed through the university.. you no longer being a student, doesn't really relate to you paying for a legitimate utility bill?\n\nNot sure if they will take you to collections for $50 or just eat it.. I guess I don't understand why you would risk your credit score over $50. Might be best to contact them.",

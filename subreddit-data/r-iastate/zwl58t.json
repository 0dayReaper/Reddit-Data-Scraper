    "postText": "Spring semester I'll be taking COM SCI 309, 331, 327, and 342. I also have a club that takes up about 4-5 hours weekly. Would it be a bad idea to also take on a part-time job with these classes (about 4-6 hours weekly)? Is there a lot of coding overall?\n\nEdit: thank you to everyone who responded. I've replaced 327 with 319, I believe this should be more manageable.",

            "comment": "309 is mostly coding, as it is a project class. 331 has pretty much no coding, but will take up a lot of time, IMO one of the hardest Com Sci classes, other than maybe 311. 327 depends on the teacher, my 327 has a yearlong group project with milestones due every week, so lots of progamming in mine. Never took 342, so not sure. \n\nHonestly, it\u2019s just up to you if it\u2019s too much, although I can say I probably would have trouble balancing everything.\n\nEdit: It also depends on the job, some on-campus jobs that aren\u2019t in a dining center can allow you to do homework while working, which could make it more manageable",

I don't know how well you handle heavy loads but to me it looks like your semester is gonna suck ass. \n\nI did not find 327 or 309 too difficult but they were extremely time-consuming. 311 and 342 probably aren't terrible if you're good at learning from lectures. I only learn from doing the homework so in the latter two I had to spend entire days poring over problems.\n\nSide note: [This YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@user-dx8qs3zm5c) helped me a lot with 311.",

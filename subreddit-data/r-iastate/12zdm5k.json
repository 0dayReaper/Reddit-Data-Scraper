    "postText": "I\u2019m having a hard time finding engineering electives that 1, fit my schedule and 2, I have the pre reqs for. According to the chem eng required classes thing, an engineering elective will be any 300+ level course outside of chem eng (and does not repeat any material from chem eng courses). I\u2019m enrolled in IE 305 (engineering economic analysis), but debating whether I should take it online or in person. One of my friends also recommended ABE 325 (Biorenewable systems) or CON E 380 (Engineering Law), but I gotta see if those work with my schedule. I also want to make sure I can handle the course load. Any advice is appreciated!",

I didn\u2019t necessarily like economics, but I did fairly well on it (microeconomics and macroeconomics) and since it has an online option, it works best for my sched. I\u2019m more interested in the other two or if there are other options out there that I\u2019m missing!",

            "comment": "Mat E 273 is a pretty popular one. At lot of the harder parts of it (like phase diagrams amd stuff) you already have learned in chem eng classes, so it's much easier. Also at least for me it was pretty interesting too! I know Mat E 273 isn't a 300 level course, but at least back in my day there was an exception for it. It largely depends on what sort of thing you are interested in though. I don't have any experience with ABE 325, IE 305 or CON E 380, but I would say if any of those sound interesting, go ahead and try them out! Also one pro strat is to sign up for more classes than you actually need, and then a few weeks into the semester, you drop the ones you don't want. Can be difficult to fit in your schedule though. Good luck man!",

I took MatE 273 and the first exam is mostly on bonding which was kinda a freebie for ChEs, second was toughest about steel phase diagrams and properties, final was on Ceramics and Polymers with ceramics just requiring memorization and polymers being kinda easy for ChEs. Only other grades from my memory were the lecture quizzes. Quizzes were about 1 per lecture, but they wouldn\u2019t be due until exam time so you would be able to go at your own pace (or cram the week of the exam). IE 305 I\u2019ve heard is very useful and at least when I had registered for it Helwig was still teaching it this semester (conflict with another class and dropped). Helwig is a great professor according to rate my professor and all my friends in IE.",

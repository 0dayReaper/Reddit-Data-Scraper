    "postText": "Hello, I am in the process of picking my last set of classes that I will be taking at ISU as a CprE student. In efforts to narrow down my list of contenders, I typically consult our glorious subreddit so see what other students and faculty have said in the past in regards to any \u201cgood to know\u201d information. Given that there is no history of any talk of 440 here, I wanted to make a post. \n\nWith that being said, does anyone have any insight for this class? Things such as how valuable it was, class load, labs, etc.",

Everyone I know couldn\u2019t even get the first project to work even though the deadline was extended twice. Nothing in the class was graded until last week. I honestly can\u2019t tell you what workload to expect because the class might change next semester that it\u2019s offered. I\u2019d recommend looking at some other classes first.",

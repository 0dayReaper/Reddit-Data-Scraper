    "postText": "I did bad at 1 of my Gen Ed classes, I was wondering if I could repeat this course at a community college and transfer in? Would my previous grade affect my GPA? Or it won\u2019t be bothered at all since I am only transferring in credits?\n\nSorry for asking here, I will speak to my advisor, but also wanted an insight from students",

So when transferring in classes only the credits are transferred in. In the case of retaking the course, the grade you received will remain on your transcript but you will be accredited for the class.",

Most of the work isn\u2019t super difficult, and isn\u2019t terribly time consuming. \n\nYou also don\u2019t have to renew each year. It applies all four years.",

            "comment": "current GWC freshman here! (lengthy response ahead...)\n\nthere's usually a few required things which you should be able to find on the website. i can list some.\n\n1. service hours - \n\nthis year, our cohort didn't have to because they changed some stuff around ? but next semester we're required to serve 20 hours OUTSIDE of campus. it's usually 10 every semester but our cohort will have double to make up for this year.\n\n2. ISCORE -\n\nit's a conference held here on campus and you're required to attend it because scholars present during that day about social issues. it's really easy and you go over it in class during the semester so minimal outside work. it's not like you present on stage, you just have a booth with a poster, kind of like in career fairs.\n\n3. UST courses -\n\ni don't know if this applies to all majors but i'm guessing it is, but there's a us diversity requirement of 3 credits, and if you take UST 105, 106, and 205, you've basically got that covered because each class is 1 credit, so not a whole lot of time commitment. super easy to pass (it's a requirement to pass the class or you lose the scholarship).\n\n4. 2.5 GPA minimum -\n\neach semester, you need to maintain a 2.5 GPA or you lose the scholarship. faculty will understand that you're a first semester student and you're trying to figure out how college works, so go talk to them if you're not confident because they're more lenient. if you do end up going under 2.5, usually, they'll have you file an appeal.\n\njust don't slack off is my best advice. i've always been a 4.0 student in high school so i thought i'd do well in my classes, but oh boy was i humbled. it adds up, and i even had to talk to my GWC instructor for it, but thankfully, i passed 2.5.\n\n5. required events -\n\nall throughout the semester, you're required to attend a minimum of 3 events hosted by the Multicultural Student Affairs (MSA). these could include the lecture series, empower hours, social events, etc. you have to prove attendance such as swiping your id card or just take a picture for backup if they do ask for proof. you then make a one page, double spaces reflection of it. super easy. plus, a lot of these events are fun!! painting pottery, afterdark, latinx cultural night, etc. lots of food!!\n\nPRO TIP THOUGH!! DO THEM EARLY!! things pile up week after week, and a lot of these events, you might not be able to go to because of exams, quizzes, extracurriculars, other commitments, or class schedule conflicts. get them done as early as possible because there's a hard deadline!! learned it the hard way!!\n\n\nCONGRATULATIONS!!!\n\nthere might be a few more i'm missing, but most of these are things that don't require much sweat unless you want it to be. as long as you're on top of these things, you should be fine, and they automatically renew as long as you do whatever is asked of you. i think you do have to file for FAFSA every year ? they remind you of your requirements throughout the semester, so honestly, don't worry too much. \n\nif you do have any questions you're curious about, please let me know! i'll be more than glad to help you out!",

All we had to do was take the classes I think. Which was nice, but after freshman year there was no way to connect with the other students and they didn\u2019t do any alumni outreach.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the information here. Our son was offered the GWC scholar opportunity and Iowa State has been on the top of his college list because of this. Has anyone heard if this new Iowa bill defunding DEI will ultimately defund the GWC scholar program? I did read through the entire bill and I presume the state could do this. It says nothing specific about scholarship money in the bill, but presumably the program itself supports  underrepresented students and thus could be in scope. This is concerning -- not to mention sending our kid to a state that feels this is necessary. I guess it is election time. During the last election our kid got death threats for being hispanic\u2026\u2026that was in a blue state. I am curious if Iowa is the right place now. This is frustrating. I\u2019m concerned that even calling the University won\u2019t get us a clear response as the bill is not even passed yet. Just curious what current GWC scholars are perhaps hearing on campus?",

I think you\u2019d be fine most likely from a financial standpoint, as any changes would most likely take a couple of years to plan and implement. But from what I heard when I visited campus last fall, a lot has changed in Iowa in the past 10 years politically and socially, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that has crept onto campus too. Due to Covid there are also fewer international students , which then decreases diversity further.",

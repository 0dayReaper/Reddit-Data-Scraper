    "postText": "I got a summer internship through the career fair, and it's my very first one, so I'm kinda freaking out because I know nothing about this process. If there's anything you can tell a freshman civil engineering intern, please do so, I would appreciate it a lot. Like what do I do the first day? What should I bring? What should I wear? What should I expect? All that stuff.\n\nAlso, when I accpeted the offer about a month ago, I wasn't given any documents to sign or that sort of stuff. Is that normal? Do I do that my first day there or are they gonna contact me as summer approaches? They did say they'll keep in touch, and I told them I'm more than willing to send out any documents they need so... Just wondering because I have no idea how this works.",

            "comment": "They will probably be in contact within the next month. In my experience most paperwork gets signed on the first day so don't worry about that.\n\nAs for what to wear, just ask your point of contact what the dress code is. If they say they don't have one I have found khakis and a polo or button down shirt to be a relatively safe bet. \n\nThey should tell you what to bring but I always bring a notebook and a pen or two on the first day to take notes. Also bring a photo ID, birth certificate, and social security card. They will need those for the onboarding process.\n\n\nThe first day is usually a lot of general training. You will get a standard training on what the expectations are for the internship along with being introduced to the company policies. You will be assigned your work area and will get to know the team you will be working with and who you will report to.\n\nMainly go in with a willingness to learn and a good attitude and you will be fine.",

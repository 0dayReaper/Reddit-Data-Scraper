    "postText": "Hey everyone, I am a soon-to-be graduate student moving to Ames in the fall and I am looking for 1 bedroom apartments to hopefully hunker down in for the whole time that I'm in school there. I am about to go visit for a tour of the campus/town and I am planning on visiting some apartments while I'm there, but being from Baltimore I don't have time to visit every single one. A lot of the previous posts about apartments are mostly pretty old too, so I was wondering if anyone has any they would recommend/avoid. Thanks!",

It is also pretty recent construction. I would avoid The Social at all costs. I have not heard anything good from friends that live there.",

It's in South Ames (the Riverbirch apartments) with a bus stop at the front of the property and pretty much everything you need within a 10 minute walking distance including Aldi, Walmart, and Target. It $760 a month, all utilities included and comes with a patio. DM me for pics if interested.",

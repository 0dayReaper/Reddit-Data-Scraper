Vote during the elections; we're a swing state that has been red for long enough that we're almost not a swing state anymore.\n\nDon't miss vital information for your exams because you're skipping class in the name of protesting a government that does not see eye-to-eye with you.\n\nVote. Get someone in there who does see eye-to-eye for the change you want to see in this world. At the end of the day, Kim does need votes to stay in there.",

Any sources on this stuff going on at the state level?\n\nEdit: I'm not worried about this (or any) walkout in particular, I'm asking about the political climate in general. Also, on average, people from my country of origin are significantly more \"liberal\" (left leaning) than Americans. So please, conservatives, refrain from invoking the spirit of Ronald Reagan to tell me that trans people are mentally ill or that trickle down economics is a sound economical theory.",

It's mostly people from IL and MN that come here and bring their blue state ideals with them (IL and MN are historically extremely liberal), but also a generational thing (people tend to be more liberal when young and get more conservative with age). You'll see stuff like this once or twice a year, but in reality only like 10-100 students actually go through with it.",

    "postText": "Hii! I'm an international grad student, and I assigned a contract for the University Village intending to live alone.\n\nHow is the safety to walk around the village and live alone there? I accept any kind of tips on that lol\n\nAs it's a little distant from the campus, I feel anxious about being a woman and living alone in a distant neighborhood and apparently far away from the supermarket and stores, but the price is way better.\n\nAs a background, I'm 26y and won't have a car at first.\n\nEdit: \nThanks for all the comments!! For sure it was super helpful and made me feel secure about my decision!",

There is really not much to worry about. The worst that could happen is someone steals your detergent while you do laundry &gt;:/ but seriously there is minimal danger. Every once in a while students receive emails about campus crimes and a majority of them actually occur in the on-campus dorms where male and female students share social spaces. Since there arent any social spaces and everyone keeps to themselves, you will be fine in UV.",

It might be more difficult for both of you guys to get a room together, but if you apply as soon as you can, you should be able to get a room. You guys might have to settle for pet friendly apartments just in case you dont get the regular non pet friendly apartments. You might have to pay a little bit extra for it, but its nothing compared to what you would pay for living in other school housing options.",

I used to study late on campus or go to a friends place and use safe ride to get back to SUV at the end of the night when the busses no longer ran. \n\nOn a different note one thing I always kept on my keychain was pepper spray for my own peace of mind but never needed it for the 5 years I was there for. Iowa nice is a real thing and a big reason I picked this school.",

There are frequent buses which might stop very close to your apartment, or might leave you with a small walk. The 6 bus and the 25 bus pass through or near UV, so it will just depend on which building you are in.\n\nOnce you are on campus, you have many options for going to a supermarket. 6 North goes right past Fareway, then out to Walmart. You can make a loop on the 1 Red that will take you out to the West HyVee. Then catch your normal bus going home.",

    "postText": "Perspective mechanical engineering student here. \n\nWe recently visited UF and were surprised that some early level math classes have between 300 and 500 students. They were saying that, even senior year, expect up to 120 students in classes specific to my major.\n\nShould I expect similar at Iowa State?",

            "comment": "Class sizes are that large for many entry level courses like calculus and physics, which are a core for many STEM degrees at ISU. I am not an ME major, so I can't attest to how much this holds true through the rest of their courses.\n\nWhat I will add is that these 100/200 level math and science courses are usually 4 or 5 credits, as in addition to the large lectures they have weekly recitations with a TA and ~15-20 students. Those are the opportunities to ask questions and gain understanding of material you may not have understood during lectures.",

Your first couple years of classes with the broader stuff like math and physics will be in bigger classes between 100-200 people but then when you get to stuff like mechanics, dynamics, and all of your other later classes those are usually in smaller groups like 50-70 people. All of the really big classes are usually 4 credits though which means you'll have a recitation with a TA once a week which will be with 20 or 30 people so then you can ask questions more easily",

I can\u2019t think of any where it\u2019s different. \n\nClasses later on should definitely be smaller than 120 and by a good margin. If you\u2019re good at seeking out resources here they offer a lot of support as long as you show up through reduced priced tutoring, free SI (group tutoring kind of), TA office hours, etc. if you need help you can find it",

I\u2019m taking PHYS 242 this semester and I took PHYS 241 last sem this class is for physics majors mainly so there\u2019s just 15 students in my class. But PHYS 231/232 usually have a lot of engineering majors. So it depends on the class.",

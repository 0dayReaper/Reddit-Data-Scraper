I got an email saying I have to have a meeting with the Department of Residence. I was sent a list of possibly reprimands and one listed was expulsion from the university. Does that seem likely or had anyone else gone through this? What is a likely outcome?",

Write ups ranged from being caught with alcohol to \"hallway sports\". Also, for some reason they let us put beer boxes on our wall as decorations, I think I said I got them out of the recycling or something like that.",

Calling me \"Responsible\" They don't do Guilty/Not Guilty, it's LITERALLY just a meeting w/ the Hall Director. Since then Nothings occurred with me and I'm assuming it wouldn't with you. You wont get a fine, you wont be contacted by the police you did nothing Illegal by having empty beer cans (So I assume I actually don't know), you wont lose your scholarships. Dont worry about it. &lt;3",

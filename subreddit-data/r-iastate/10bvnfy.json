Everyone's situation is different and even if you have extreme interest there's only so many hours in the day and it can be a tough balancing act between school, work possibly, and your own mental health. So even if you're interested in the subject, some people really do care.\n\nThat said, in my own experience, while I haven't taken a religion class, the workloads are about the same because the they have the goal to reach the same material. The difference I see for myself is that online classes require extra motivation to tune into lectures or watch asynchronously if need be. It is a lot easier to skip a lecture if there's no physical place you need to be at. \n\nWith that, I prefer the in-person experience because it can be more interactive experience while the workload tends to be similar.\n\nSome classes I've taken have also been hybrid, some of these classes I've realized are just the professor lecturing at the students and I don't find a real benefit from being there in person. With these classes, I prefer to do them online because I don't have a car so it can be more convient to watch the lectures at home, but like I said before it can be very tempting to skip a lecture when I do this, which has bitten me the butt a few times.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! I'm a prospective international graduate student at Iowa State University. I'm starting to research housing options for the upcoming semester and I'm wondering which would be a better choice - on-campus SUV or off-campus housing options. I'd love to hear from those who have experience with either or both.\n\nLocation and safety is important to me, as I want to be within a reasonable distance from my classes and campus facilities. Cost is another concern, and I want to make sure that I'm getting the best value for my money.\n\nIf you are also searching for a roommate and living space, or have any leads, please feel free to contact me. \n\nIf anyone has any experiences, insights, or advice to share, I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you in advance for your help.",

            "comment": "Well if it's your first time here, on campus is your safest bet as there will always be buses to and from there, specially SUV. I know a lot of international students who live in the village so it is a good option. \n\nOff-campus is bettter, in my opinion, if you can get an apartment close to campus. Once you get here and get used to the roads, you can have a better idea of a good on campus apartment. So far, the most popular options are the apartments on Sheldon avenue, Welsh, campus avenue, Union and towards the Hy-Vee. I myself live on Sheldon avenue which is right in front of Howe.",

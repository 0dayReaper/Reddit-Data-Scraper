Expect around $200 on a controller, $250 on quad kit, and $500+ for FPV gear if you want decent stuff new (at least from what I remember). I used to fly around Carroll Marty in my college days but living in downtown MPLS now so I'm not flying much.\n\nJust to be clear, when I say decent I really mean not garbage. You can spend a lot more, but if you spend less you may have a bad time. Also have no idea if flying at Carroll Marty is legal.",

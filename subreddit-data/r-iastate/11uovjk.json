    "postText": "Here is my situation, I transferred into ISU\u2019s ME program at the beginning of first semester. I am technically a sophomore but my course load is essentially that of a freshman going through the engineering program. My question is should I have done a internship this summer? I have heard from a lot of other ME students that sophomore year you really need to get a internship.",

They obviously help, but my friend never got one and he had a job shortly after he graduated (and would've had one sooner but he was super picky with where he worked). So not having one for this summer is no problem",

The license helps with promotions/getting better jobs outside of your current company and also if your wanted to do freelance work. It's generally suggested to take the first licensing exam within a year of graduation since it's mainly just an exam covering everything we've learned",

Having been someone who didn\u2019t have an internship before graduation, getting a job after graduation without an internship all depends on your project experience and your GPA. I graduated in May and spent 2 months to study for the FE EIT license. Was licensed in August and started to apply, finally landed a job in May. It took me 8 months to land my first job. Although, I do agree that not being picky with your first job or industry will help you land one quicker. Don\u2019t be afraid to look into recruiting/contract companies like Palmer Group or Actalent if you\u2019re finding difficulty in getting interviews.\n\nHaving an internship by sophomore year isn\u2019t crucial but just getting one before graduation will help immensely. Internships aren\u2019t available to post graduates. \n\nRegarding the license. I can speak to this since I have my EIT from passing the FE exam. It\u2019s not needed at all depending on the industry you go into. As a civil engineer, it\u2019s common to have to need one because as you advance in this career, if you become a PE, you will need to be licensed to sign off on design drawings and such. This isn\u2019t really the same in ME unless this is the path you intend on following. An EIT license can help you leverage yourself against other candidates in the application pool if you have weak academics and no internship experience. I do agree also that it will help with well-roundedness and provide more opportunities in more industries. Hope this helps and good luck.",

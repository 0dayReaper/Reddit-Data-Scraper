The homework is the hardest part as it\u2019s double assignments and some of the weeks will literally take 10+ hours and even longer if you don\u2019t cheat on them. However, for me the exam was open notes 2 pages front and back. Practice exams are very good problems to study for as if you can do the entire practice exam you\u2019ll pass the class. The test is 100/130 and you\u2019re not expected to finish it. The class is just a million miles wide but 6 inches deep. Understand all the concepts and it\u2019ll flow together nicely. Do not miss class and don\u2019t skip studying or cheat on the homework and you\u2019ll do fine. The final  project is very tough on the time limit given\u2026 we had about 5 days for it. However, it\u2019s 6% of final grade and the first 3% are easy to get as long as you\u2019ve been paying attention in class and labs. Good summer class if you can not submerging in classes and really just not focusing on much else.",

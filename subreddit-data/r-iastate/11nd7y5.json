I lived in Buchanan and it was very boring with no community. \n\nPretty sure there\u2019s a club sport for just about anything you could want. I would have a couple in mind and then invite people on your floor to go with you or form a team.",

There's also like 2 dining halls, Clyde's, and a convenience store literally a minute away from each other. Plus, it's near state gym.\n\nFriley has a lot of social events that you can go to and they're mostly with food and at night, and you run into people all the time, especially if you stay in your house's den the first 1-2 months. That's where I met most of my friends right now. Also, I got in the elevator once and these two dudes just started complimenting each other's heights out of nowhere. They got off the same floor, and I'm pretty sure they're friends now. Kinda cute honestly",

Both of them do have learning communities for some majors including Computer Science, so if you want to meet people in the same major as you, a learning community would be a great option if you could spare 1 credit hour or maybe 2? I'm in an LC right now with the living option, and most, if not all, of my friends are engineers which is great especially your first year since you're all doing your basic program courses, so yall are taking the same classes. All I have to do is go to our den and they're usually in there studying. Friley is also much bigger, with like 500+ ? more people.\n\nI don't know much about Helser, but I'd say it's really up to your preferences. I considered Helser myself when I was applying, but what sold me is Windows and the AC. It was convenient having a dining hall open til 11pm.",

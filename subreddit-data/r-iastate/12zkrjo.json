The Dinky was the easiest way to get from the Ames depot onto campus, otherwise you\u2019d have to hire a wagon if you had luggage.  At the beginning and end of semesters they would have special full size train service twice a day between downtown and campus to handle the mass of incoming or outgoing students.",

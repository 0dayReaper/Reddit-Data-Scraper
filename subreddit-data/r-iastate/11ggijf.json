    "postText": "I'm gonna be living in Ames over the summer and I want to have a space to store and work on a motorbike and a few other mech projects. Storage lockers are an option, but I'm looking for something with a bit more flexibility, like a detached garage of a house that somebody's willing to rent out. Budget's pretty flexible. \n\nIs this a thing you can do or a place you ask people about this?",

I don't live in Iowa anymore; I'm just back for Thanksgiving with family. \n\nI don't know much about the current state of things, but the [Creative Corridor](http://iowascreativecorridor.com/home/) regional alliance seems to be plugging along steadily, and that was initially born out of an attempt to be proactive and strategic about attracting more high-tech businesses to Iowa City and Cedar Rapids. Riding the coattails of urban development and growth in those two cities is helping too, I'm sure.",

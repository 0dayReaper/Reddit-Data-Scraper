    "postText": "My son was offered full tuition scholarship at Iowa State for Electrical Engineering.  He was also accepted to UIUC and Purdue, but without FA and will be paying OOS tuition.  While we can manage paying OOS costs, a full tuition is hard to pass up and we are wondering if there is substantial difference between these schools. Looking for input from current EE students here: are you satisfied with the quality of education, professors, courses, opportunities for research/internships, etc?  Any input is appreciated.",

The classes and professors are generally pretty tough, but are very knowledgeable in their respective fields. I think one of the best things Iowa State offers is the ability for undergrads to be a TA for classes, not all schools will offer that opportunity. There are also many opportunities to get involved in projects, research, and clubs if you seek them out. Iowa State also has 2 career fairs every year for internship opportunities, but I have found more success with online applications. In my opinion it would be best to take the full ride and save that money for a prestigious grad school if your son is thinking about doing grad school.",

They are borderline freakish in their knowledge and abilities.

Iowa states power systems and control systems are \"at very least\" 5 years behind local industry and possibly more like 10. \n\nI have frequent complaints from friends and colleagues to back my claim most working in utilities, control systems, and product design.\n\nTheir lag on modern software and techniques is embarrassing and made me sound like a moron in interviews early on in my career. I spent years re-educating myself online and with books so I could get anywhere at all. Over a dozen certifications later and thousands of pages of iso standards, I'm doing all right. \n\nIf they want research they will get it. If they want to get aPh.D. and teach at ISU they are pretty much good to go here. \n\nI am an ISU alumni currently working as an engineering manager for a large international corporation.

For those who have taken MGMT 478, did you actually need your textbook or was the supplemental material (videos, PowerPoints, etc) enough for you to succeed?\n\nNOTE:  I want an A in this class and am not just looking to pass.  I don't want to miss required assignments if the only way to access them is through the textbook.",

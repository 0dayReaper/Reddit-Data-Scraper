            "comment": "Is this cross-listed Env Sci/Geol 324 taught by Aaron Wood? I believe that it is and if so I took it last semester and would say it\u2019s not too difficult. Class is 3 exams and a final with lowest non final score dropped. 3 homework assignments that didn\u2019t take too long and a ~5 page paper that did take some time but there are multiple prompt options and I had no difficulty reaching length. In class pop quizzes are given ~ once a week where if you take it in class you are given the answers and get full credit, or can be taken outside of class for full credit, but won\u2019t be given the answers. If you attend class I am sure it is an easy time, but there is also plenty of opportunity to get a good grade while missing some classes.",

Just be sure to follow up with online lectures and actually watch the entire thing. \n\nAlso, to expand on what you said: You can finish in-class activities up to the end of the day they\u2019re delivered, but without knowing the content, they\u2019re super hard\u2014 thankfully extra credit can make up the difference for at least a few of them. He also grades them more harshly if you don\u2019t complete them in class. I\u2019d just make sure to show up to lecture, which isn\u2019t hard because they\u2019re pretty engaging.",

Three exams plus a final, occasional quizzes/homework, and in-class activities make up almost all of your grade, and you can get a fair amount of extra credit. \n\nIt\u2019s just a genuinely great class to expand your perspective as an engineer and as a person. It\u2019s never boring, and you learn a lot about environmental science in a way that\u2019s super quantitative and digestible for engineering students like us. And it\u2019s a pretty easy A. I highly recommend 324.",

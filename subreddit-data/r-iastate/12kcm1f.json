A queen is 6\" wider.\n\nMy roommate has a queen bed and was fine, they just did most of their work / living in the living room downstairs.",

Either way the squeeze will be snugged but doable so long as your desk isn\u2019t to big",

            "comment": "I live in pet friendly apartment. I also have a full size but it is already crowded if you put a table to the other end where the wall is tilted. That makes it pretty hard to make full use of every part of the room. I used to live in a small room in Hong Kong so it is not a problem for me, but I expect one really need to spend some time to find out the best way to smartly fit a queen size bed in the room if you don't want to only have a bed in your room.",

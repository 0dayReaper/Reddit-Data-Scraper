            "comment": "For Friley, by FAR the most social floors are up in the rafters.\n\nThat means Lorch-Russell (on the west side), and the twin houses of Bennett and Niles Foster (on the east).\n\nFor a house to be \"social\" it basically needs to be a place where people feel comfortable leaving their doors open.  Which is only the case when an area doesn't get much (if any) non-house people walking by.\n\nOne might think that the basement houses would be good, but no,  the basements are where all the laundry rooms are at.  If you want social atmosphere you need to climb to the very top of the building.",

If you can find a Class E license holder willing to work with you (Ingersoll Wine &amp; Spirits down in Des Moines is a good starting point), they can put in an order to ABD but it'll be pricey, and it won't happen over night.\n\nAnd if it's a limited supply product, what ABD calls \"highly allocated\", the state holds a lottery for which stores get the bottles.  If a product isn't on the inventory, but a store has it, then they won it in the lottery.",

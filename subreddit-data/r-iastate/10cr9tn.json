He tried to do homework, but between not always knowing about homework and not understanding homework, it was an extreme challenge. He wound up going on the five year plan. I\u2019m not sure how much of that was grades vs scheduling, but especially with the cost of tuition, try to get done in 4 years or less. Go to class and do homework.",

Keep your dorm door open when you're hanging out and say hi to people when they pass by. Join a couple of clubs. I didn't, and I kind of regret it. Enjoy campus; it's beautiful.",

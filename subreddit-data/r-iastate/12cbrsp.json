    "postText": " \n\nI recently had interview with one of client from classboxes. So, I had applied via Indeed and had received interview from one of their client. If you don't know than classboxes is consultancy company. I didn't knew much about classboxes and only looked at glassdoor reviews. The position was for entry level position.\n\nHere are things that made me angry and I want your opinion of what should I have done.\n\nIn the interview, I was started asking questions related to Springboots and RestAPI Annotations. I had already clarified them before interview that I do not know much about Springboot and I only used in during class project but they said they will provide me every training.\n\nSo, in that Interviewer started asking me basic questions which I answered correctly. After that, he started asking me questions that not anyone having little experience will know. He started asking me how to integrate program using Hibernate framework, describe every annotations that Springboot use and when you use annotations, how do you inject dependencies, list me names of dependencies, etc. At certain point, I got fear and the interviewer madly shouted at me that you don't know anything and you didn't even prepared for interview. When he asked me questions related to Rest annotations at the end, I was correct to my answer but the interviewer started saying that no you are wrong. This is wrong answer. correct answer is this. And he literally kept shouting at me. At the end, when i was asked question that does Springboot uses java7. I said yes. than that interviewer told me this shows you do not know anything about Springboot and everyone will laugh at you. It uses java8. I was so shattered with the confidence that I didn't knew if I was right or wrong.\n\nAfter interview ended, i looked up to some of the questions but I was indeed right. I am feeling to reach out to this interviewer. Do you know what should I do? Because I have applied at other companies as well but I never saw this type of reactions from any of interviewers. In fact, I have 2 job offers line up and I only interviewed because this application was submitted very long back. I thought to take this as learning lesson and that's why only I showed up for interview.\n\nDo you have any suggestions what I should do? Because no interviewer will do this like yelling at you, saying this type of words.",

Beyond that, you don\u2019t have control. \n\nIt sounds like you tried your best and he was being very unreasonable. Any kind of yelling or shouting is not acceptable in hiring process, that\u2019s not your fault he has anger issues. In his position even if a candidate is being rude, you simply either end the interview then, or continue the interview then don\u2019t hire them. It\u2019s not personal, especially at that point before you\u2019re an employee. \n\nSince you have two offers already, you obviously are merited enough to get a position in the field. You shouldn\u2019t overthink it and instead should discard this interviewer as someone else being unreasonable. Nothing more to do about it.",

However\u2026 I had friends in most other dorm halls and very few had the social experience and sense of community I had there. Now this was over 10 years ago and each class is unique but every one of my groomsmen that wasn\u2019t family was in my Helser dorm hall. No guarantees but I wouldn\u2019t trade my first two years at Iowa state in Helser for just about anything.",

Other times, it was always one fan constantly on with the window still open.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to be more social and having a community, helser isn\u2019t a bad option to stay at. Just make sure that you bring a REALLY good fan, I used one made by Honeywell and it helped with the heat.",

            "comment": "And are students, in general, kidding themselves that they are going to college for purely educational reasons? Or that they are moral paragons void of responsibility for the current state of ISU? Or, I don't know...are students complex creatures with multiple motives, like securing an advantage in a job market (money), preparing themselves for something larger than themselves, experiencing a novel and libertine lifestyle outside of the home, partaking in a ritual of the American dream that they've been told is mandatory since grade school, pleasing their parents, pursuing fascinating areas of study, discovering who they are and what they want in life, meeting new friends and relationships, watching sports, staying on their expected timeline for life events, and on and on, etc.? Boiling people's motives down to one thing is great for memes but poor for critical thinking. Are we as students motivated to attend ISU? Yep. Will ISU returning in-person make ISU money? Yep. Will it also do about a thousand other things that keep our desires from being impeded by ISU shutting down? Indeed. Every person enrolled is part of a complex industry that, at each tiny little decision or avoidance of the inconvenience of not going to ISU, slightly values the world pre-COVID to the contemporary COVID world, and all the ethical and moral dilemmas therein. \n\n[Bentham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham), founder of utilitarianism, invented something called \"felicific calculus,\" a way of quantifying whether an action was right depending on how much pleasure it caused versus its harm. \n\n1. Intensity: How strong is the pleasure/pain?\n2. Duration: How long will the pleasure/pain last?\n3. Certainty or uncertainty: How likely or unlikely is it that the pleasure/pain will occur?\n4. Propinquity or remoteness: How soon will the pleasure/pain occur?\n5. Fecundity: The probability that the action will be followed by sensations of the same kind.\n6. Purity: The probability that it will not be followed by sensations of the opposite kind.\n7. Extent: How many people will be affected?\n\nLots of students will answer these questions related to COVID differently. For instance: *How bad is it really? Doesn't it only last a couple weeks? Most people seem to be just fine, right?* etc., regardless of the accuracy of those answers. Philosophers have since shredded Bentham because they recognized that pleasures were not all equal: is the joy of feeding the hungry the same as getting a buzz? (John Stuart Mill attempted to shore up these deficiencies, but that's beside the point.) However, most of us are not philosophers (or epidemiologists) and, indeed, operate in pursuit of our pleasures and in avoidance of pain. Before trashing ISU, consider how your felicific calculus led you to attend school instead of stay home, and how that desire put pressure x 30k on the administration to act exactly as they have acted so far. Then add in the Ames community, its economy, most other universities doing the same, the board of regents, etc...and the image gets more flawed, but also more human.",

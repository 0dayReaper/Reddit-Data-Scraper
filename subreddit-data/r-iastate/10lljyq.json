I just realized clubfest was a few days ago and it would have been cool to know....",

It's weird that ISU doesn't have a page that lists all the benefits (that I can find, anyway). Sign up for The Daily's email list, they cover events on campus and other student-interest topics. ISU also has an official Events Calendar on their website you can use.",

There will probably be some free food.\n\nLibrary - You can access a lot of academic texts for free online through the library's website.\n\nState Gym - Gains, exercise, stress relief, etc. I regret not going more often. It has a nice little track, wide variety of machines and free weights, climbing wall, pool, badminton courts, and basketball courts.",

They had these biofeedback machines where you could go, sit in a comfy recliner, and play video games that you controlled with your breathing/heart rate to help you learn to self-soothe. I would fall asleep in the chair, lol. So under-utilized",

Also Culvers gives a discount when you show your student ID. \nHonestly, it is worth asking at places like the mechanic, tire places, mattress places, etc if they have a student discount. When I have asked, even if they don\u2019t have a student discount, they will try to give me some other type of discount.",

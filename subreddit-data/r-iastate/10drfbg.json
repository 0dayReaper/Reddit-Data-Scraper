It\u2019s not hard at all (got an A and really didn\u2019t do much outside of class except exam study), once you understand a lot of the terms, the MC on the test can be self explanatory, because you can rule out 2 or 3 answers per question even when you don\u2019t know the question. In conclusion, know the terms, (for example \u201cwhat are the 4 things needed to prove intentional infliction of emotional distress?\u201d) and also know the cases that you discuss in class to the level of being able to explain the two sides, the key issue, and the verdict. If you have any questions at all, let me know!",

    "postText": "Hello, I am currently an early entry Masters student in mathematics at another university. However, I have an internship in Iowa this summer, which more than likely will lead to a full time position after I graduate with my bachelor\u2019s degree. I love my current university, but it would be impossible to continue attending there if this happens. Does anyone know if there is a process for transferring as a graduate student or would I need to apply as a new graduate student and completely start over with zero credits? For background, with my current GPA, I am not required to take the GRE at my current university and haven\u2019t done so.\n\nThanks for any help.",

But I do remember that at the graduate level things are much more based on reputation than tests/grades/other scores.  If you are on good terms with the faculty at your old university you are much more likely to get into ISU.",

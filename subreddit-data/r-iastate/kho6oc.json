            "comment": "Howdy, y\u2019all!\n\nMy obsession with making campus maps continues! For a while, I\u2019ve wanted to make an animated map that reveals buildings as they were constructed. I started working on this roughly 2 weeks ago.\n\nMy process:\n\nI downloaded a high-res satellite map from a USDA database (edit: I pulled the satellite imagery from the [Iowa Geographic Map Server](https://ortho.gis.iastate.edu/) ). After importing it into QGIS, I made a layer for buildings/Lake Laverne, where I drew those features and entered the construction date available from FPM. I made a second layer that had roads on it to give the viewer more context for building placement.\n\nIn R, I used the ggplot2 and gganimate packages to create an animation of the map. Here\u2019s my code:\n   \n    # Load necessary packages\n    library(tidyverse) # For piping, mutating\n    library(sf) # For importing shapefiles\n    library(gganimate) # For animations\n    library(transformr) # For using gganimate (?)\n    \n    # Load in files for campus buildings, roads\n    shapes &lt;- st_read('~/Documents/buildings_campus/buildings.shp') # Campus buildings\n    features &lt;- st_read('~/Documents/buildings_campus/features.shp') # Roads\n    \n    # Create an animated plot object\n    anim &lt;- shapes %&gt;%\n      mutate(year = as.factor(year_built)) %&gt;% # Converts the \"year_built\" variable from numeric to factor\n      ggplot() + # Specifies that we're plotting something\n      geom_sf(data = shapes,\n              color = \"black\",\n              fill = \"black\") + # Displays campus buildings in black\n      transition_states(year_built,\n                        transition_length = 1,\n                        state_length = 2) + # Reveals buildings based on year_built\n      geom_sf(data = features,\n              color = \"gray\",\n              fill = \"gray\") + # Displays roads in gray\n      shadow_mark() + # Keeps the buildings in frames as year_built progresses\n      theme_void() + # Gets rid of grid lines/labels\n      labs(title = \"Iowa State University central campus buildings\",\n           subtitle = \"{closest_state}\") + # Titles the plot, says the subtitle should show year of current frame\n      theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n            plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n            plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"bold\",\n                                         size = 16)) # Gets rid of legend, centers title, makes subtitle bold and larger\n    animate(plot = anim,\n            nframes = 330,\n            fps = 4,\n            end_pause = 10) # Animates the plot with 330 frames, 4 frames per second, and 10 frames at the end of gif\n    anim_save(\"anim.gif\", animation = last_animation()) # Saves the last animation as a gif\n\nAnyway, this was fun to make! I hope you find it interesting and informative!\n\nedit 2: I also forgot to mention that I've only included buildings that are currently on campus, and that I had trouble discerning original buildings from extensions/additions built later on. I was able to tell some additions apart but not for the majority of buildings.",

The book has a few old re-created campus maps in the back, but the biggest plus is the old info on buildings no longer around. Being able to do the streets like they were in the past would be the biggest plus, though it is a big task. However, the [Ames History Center](https://archive.org/details/Ames-History-Archives) has several old phone books and student directories, which frequently includes maps, on its Internet Archive page.\n\nI attempted a similar project for Campustown and the dormitories some years ago. It still sits very incomplete and mostly an outline.",

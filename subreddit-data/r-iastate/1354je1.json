    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI'm an incoming freshman for Iowa State, and I want to purchase a laptop for college through the ISU book store because it's cheaper. However, whenever I try to login with the ISU ID, I get sent to a page that says \"Invalid login attempt\". \n\nDoes this mean I have to wait until I actually start classes at Iowa State to purchase from the bookstore, or do I need to register as a new customer?",

I'm guessing it's not the first time that's happened.",

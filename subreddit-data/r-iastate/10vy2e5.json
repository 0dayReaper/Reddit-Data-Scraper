I am considering applying for the Data Research Analyst job at kingland but I\u2019m in my last semester so I won\u2019t be working 2 semesters with them. \n\nIs this a deal breaker for employment or are they desperate enough for employees that they won\u2019t mind",

I don't think you'd care because you're graduating. You may also not want to use them as a reference for your next job due to leaving before your contract.\n\nI'm sure they are very used to people leaving before the contract ends. Also, people quit without giving two week notices all the time. It's fine.\n\nIf they ask if you can stay for two semesters, be honest. If you can work through summer break, mention that. Some graduates stay in Ames for the summer while looking for work, I don't know if that's you. You could also ask if continuing to work after graduation is a problem. Perhaps you didn't anticipate getting an awesome job offer (of course you did), and that's why you suddenly have to leave.",

I didn\u2019t want to do that work either but worked at Convos as a last resort and ended up staying for almost 2 years. It was super easy and as long as you put in a decent effort and don\u2019t no call, no show they genuinely liked you (and would even shift some of the stricter rules to accommodate you)!",

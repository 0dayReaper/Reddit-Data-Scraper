Your first semester you only have to work 4hrs/week and 5 during finals week so it\u2019s pretty easy. I worked there last semester and I absolutely loved it, easy to squeeze between classes, and the manager was awesome. They do typically want people to work mornings though, so if you\u2019re available in the morning that will improve your application a lot.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m taking dynamics this semester and I\u2019m having trouble conceptually understanding what we are doing. My professor is an assistant professor, he will go over the conceptual ideas and the equations that are relevant however, examples of how these equations are used are far and few between. \n\nIs anyone taking dynamics this semester with a professor that demonstrated problems during lecture time so that I could sit in? \n\nAdditionally I have not found any information about SI for dynamics this semester and I think they may not be offering that as an option but I may be mistaken.",

            "comment": "To be clear, the point of this vpn is NOT security. It may provide a tiny bit of security, but it has no promises and it's well within the university's rights to see all that you do. Also, you don't get the main benefit of a normal vpn - location spoofing (unless you're out of state and want to spoof as Iowa I guess). Its intended use is to be able to access on-campus only resources. I think a lot of the things that you used to need it for, like the remote computer lab access, don't need it anymore either.",

So I panicked when I tried to finish my project while visiting my parents for thanksgiving, because i could not open SolidWorks. I then remembered I could use the VPN and was able to finish my project.",

            "comment": "Cpre 381 mainly consist of you making a basic processor from scratch and then testing it with basic algorithms at the end. The class subject is similar to 321 but instead of ARM you will learn MIPS as your low level programming language. Labs for 381 took a shit ton of time for me was very hard to digest. The teachers such as Zamberno or Duwe were very good teachers and I highly recommend going to office hours if you ever get stuck. (THEY ARE MVP Resource) and you will get stuck.\n\nSo why would you take 381 if 321 is so much easier?\n\nIf you like the challenge and its great if you want to learn more about embedded processors and how to learn to use/implement low level programming.\n\nSecond, students who take the 4-credit lab courses CPR E 288, CPR E 308, and CPR E 381 instead of the corresponding 3-credit alternatives can apply the additional credits toward Supplemental Electives. The total number of credits required in the Software Engineering Program remains the same for all students.",

            "comment": "I can't speak for the workload of 321 but in 381 the most notable thing is you're going to be making a processor. The lab work will really pick up once you hit project 1 (single-cycle processor) and project 2 (pipeline processor). I think it really helped that I liked the content of the course, because I spent a lot of time debugging digital circuits.\n\n\nIf you really want to continue your learning of digital circuits from 281, I'd recommend 381. Otherwise, I'm sure 321 takes a more SW approach to processor design. And would serve you similarly well.",

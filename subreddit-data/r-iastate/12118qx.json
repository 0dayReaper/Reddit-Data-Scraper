By the end of my senior year, I will have over  90 percent of my general Ed\u2019s done. Should I double major in both of these? What are the programs like in each major?",

            "comment": "CS and CybE are in two different colleges/departments so they have different gen Ed requirements. CS is college of LAS and CybE is college of engineering.  Double check you have the gen Ed\u2019s done for both. If you do, then double majoring would be solid, considering a lot of people transfer majors from the difficult gen eds *cough cough, calc 2 cough cough*.\n\nI would never recommend double majoring in 2 different colleges because taking all the gen eds would take a lot of time. But if you are truly 90% done and they all transfer, go for it.",

They are very similar in terms of classes you have to take. \nIt's up to you to decide if you have the mental capacity to take on a double major, especially something that is both stem majors which will be highly time consuming. The cybersecurity program at ISU is still very new. You still have a while to go before you pick your path in college, many come in for one thing and leave with a different degree then what they came here for initially. (also doubt on the gen ed's done considering our school has some weirdly strict requirements on those classes and they must be taken at ISU, not that it matters that much).",

Most of the time transfer credits will not be accepted to fulfill those requirements. ISU has a website for evaluating transfer credits. https://transit.iastate.edu/  you can use this to find out what your transfer credits are equivalent to at ISU. It's literally like 2 or 3 classes for Gen Eds. and then there are tech electives as well that are different.",

            "comment": "I'd recommend checking out either computer engineering, software engineering, or cybersecurity. Computer science here is more theory based and rather than technical. This meaning that it's more for solving computing problems rather than making code and making projects. You also miss some classes in CS that help you understand how computers work that is also helpful for cyber, but not crucial. If you go into  any of the three above majors you also have the option of more security electives. Additionally you have the option in computer engineering to master in security. I think if you want to do anything in security or relating to security your best bet would be the majors listed. I would recommend going through each of their course catalogs though and looking through their classes and see what one interests you most. All are good options though, very similar in the end.",

If you are interested in cybersecurity, reach out to cybersecurity professors about doing research as an undergrad, there are almost always openings for those interested. Not sure if I can recommend cybersecurity of CprE, as CprE is a much more versatile major.",

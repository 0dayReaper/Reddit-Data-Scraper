How can I do that? I am a transfer student and new to this university so it\u2019s difficult for me to know everything",

Write down your questions so you can go through them one by one.\n\nRemember that your advisor is also just a person so when they miss answering some questions in an email just remind yourself of every time you've messed up an email and that they're likely the advisor for dozens of students and if they're a professor there's additional time constraints. (Like the college of business hires people as just advisors but the agronomy program has professors be advisors to undergrads sometimes so the ability to focus on one role is different in different programs and colleges)",

In person doesn't help either, however, I would always do in person with advisors and write questions down so you don't forget. You can switch advisors, and if you're early on, I would suggest it. I had this same advisor and he never really took the time to help me while I was there so I just quit seeing him. He screwed up and recommended classes that didn't count for my gen eds. He's also given other advice with classes that really put me into worse situations than if I had done what I planned out. \n\nFeel free to DM me I graduated almost 2 years ago and always see posts about this advisor and like to help.",

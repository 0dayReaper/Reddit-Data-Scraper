Or I disconnect and when I turn my wifi back on it doesn\u2019t automatically connect and I have to manually go into wifi settings and click eduroam for me to connect.\n\nHopefully this fix it while majority of people leave this summer, cause the wifi issues are ridiculous all over campus (can never do anything in the library because of it).",

    "postText": "Hello, since we are coming to the last few weeks of the semester, I was wondering what I could use my CyCash on? I have mainly only used it for washing and drying my clothes in the dorms. I only have around $8 left, so was just wondering if there was any other application. Also, if there is none, will the CyCash roll over into next semester? Thanks.",

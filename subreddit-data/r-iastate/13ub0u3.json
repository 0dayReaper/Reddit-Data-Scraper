    "postText": "Hello All,  \n\n\nI am an MIS student and choose to take CS 228 instead of the MIS equivalent because I want to take COM S classes as electives to work on a specialization in SE. My issue is I got a D in Com S 228 and don't meet the C- minimum requirement for pre-reqs. Since I am not a SE/CS major how likely is it the profs would waive the pre-req for Com S: 327 / 362 / 363 / 309? I Severely understand the material I just chronically fail tests and we didn't get a curve.   \n\n\nAdditionally, If these classes are typically taught by the same professor could you please inform me what prof so that I may get in contact with them.",

That being said, they didn't contribute a thing so they may be more strict now?\n\nMy question to you is, why are you just not an SE? Sounds like you're planning on taking enough of the curriculum that you should really just be in the major. It'd help you so much more in your job search if you want to get into software development.",

It's one thing to be bad at the math; you can suck at calc 2 or diff eq and scrape by.  But a D in *Intro to Data Structures* is another thing entirely.  \n\n&gt;Com S: 327 / 362 / 363 / 309\n\n309 will absolutely destroy you.",

I know that different people learn differently and not everything is entirely your fault. \n\nI would look at what was graded that led to the D. Was it circumstance or were you at fault? If it was circumstance, I would appeal to have the grade changed with the reasons why. If you were at fault, although you may not like it, it is very much core classes and concepts to understand. \n\n&gt;I Severely understand the material I just chronically fail tests and we didn't get a curve. \n\nThis I am also a little unsure about because of the above-mentioned. Honestly, for data structures you should be able to remember them and pull them out like it's nothing. It's a very critical component that the class attempts to address. So from this post I am not entirely convinced you know the material well (but I know some processors are just difficult, which is why I offered an appeal process)\n\n&gt;Since I am not a SE/CS major how likely is it the profs would waive the pre-req for Com S: 327 / 362 / 363 / 309?\n\nAlthough I would not recommend it at all, you can pretty much get into any class as long as you can give a valid reason for it. However, if your reason is to be able to \"graduate on time\" I don't think that's good enough reason. It should be deeper than that. \n\nThat said, 327, 362, 363 and 309 are all very different classes bit will require good knowledge of Data structures (but honestly, any and all good coding classes should). Again, not sure how fully you understood the material, but I would really try to find out exactly why you got a D first before doing anything else. \n\nHope this helps. \n\nTldr: try to find out why you got a D before jumping into anything else",

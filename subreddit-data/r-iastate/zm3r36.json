I was looking for short term leases for this fall and ended up getting a contract at university village. \n\nI found a lot of places increase the rent by at least $100 for short term leases. Not many people come in during the spring for a lease so it\u2019s a unit they have sitting empty for half a year. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to live on campus your best bet is sublease. Facebook is a great way to find one. I would guess most people won\u2019t be making a final decision to study abroad for Fall 2023 until next month so you won\u2019t hear much until then. Hope you can find something that works!",

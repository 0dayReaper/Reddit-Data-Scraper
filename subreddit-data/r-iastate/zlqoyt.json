I realized we had accidentally swapped last time I was at Seven Oakes (12/16) and left your son\u2019s skis with the ladies at the front desk. They called you that evening, and they said they could swap them out for mine next time you were there. So sorry about the whole thing! I could also facilitate the swap if need be, I\u2019m hoping to get my skis back by next week for a trip. -Thanks",

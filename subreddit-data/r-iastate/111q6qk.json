            "comment": "First of all, there's a difference between \"hyper-masculine\" and toxic. Many gym bros can be nice and very friendly, and almost none of them hate on you, especially female gym goers. Second of all, this is major circular reasoning:  \n\n\nMore men go to the gym than women. Why is this the case? Because women are afraid to go to gyms \"dominated by men\". Why are the gyms dominated by men? Because men go to the gym at a higher rate than women... and so it goes on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut tbh, there's a ton of women I see go to the gym at state (where I go). Given, they moreso dominate the treadmill/stairmaster area where guys I see dominate the weigh training area, but still.",

Lat pulldown, cable row machine row at state if you want one and its taken sit at the benches. Hacksquat/Leg press the benches next to the water fountain, racks and platforms, the benches opposite the basketball court, and if you're not ready to take that equipment, especially on a busy day. Someone who doesnt know others were waiting will just fucking take it not realizing and most people dont pre-emptively say \"Hey, I'm waiting on this machine same as everyone behind me\" or \"Hey, I'm waiting on this machine first but feel free to work in\" like to me thats just a big misunderstanding theyre not close to you because of YOU theyre close to you because they want the machine and dont want someone to take it",

You may not like it and there are steps you can take to mitigate it, but it's nigh impossible to avoid it.  \n\n\nFor the record, women have had feelings of discomfort attending regular gyms for a number of years. That's why Anytime Fitness, or hell, even Curves, has a market value.",

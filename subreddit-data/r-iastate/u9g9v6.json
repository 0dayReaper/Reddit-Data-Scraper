YOU CAN'T DO THAT! ESPECIALLY NOT WITH TAX MONEY I HARDLY CONTRIBUTED TO THAT COULD BE PUT TO BETTER USE BY PUTTING IT IN A VAULT!\n\nI honestly don't understand how these insufferable bastards are allowed to have a group. All they ever seem to do is cry about people that aren't straight, white christians existing. Do they actually do anything? Or stand for anything? Anything other than \"Iowa is mostly white Christians so we should not permit anyone who is not that to enjoy life.\"?",

They begin shouting insults down at the protesters from a parking ramp for basically being \u201cpoor\u201d telling them to get jobs, bragging about their wealth.  When a group of protesters come up to confront them Collins and his buddies run away like fucking cowards.   If anyone can find this video don\u2019t let it die.  \n\nTaylor Collins is the grandson of Bob McCulley owner of Tri-Oak foods.  Collins has never had a real job in his life. He is a Drake drop out.  He\u2019s coasted by on his families money and used his grandfathers pull with Iowa Republicans to get Himself a job working for Kim Reynolds directly out of college.  After that brief gig he moved back to southeast Iowa into an apartment his grandfather pays for so Collins and his GF can live rent free.  Collins chose this district because he knows he can run uncontested.  \n\nThe last thing Iowa needs is another Trumper born with a silver spoon up his ass acting like he has Iowans best interest in mind.  Collins only cares about one thing and that\u2019s his taxes (and the estate tax) being as low as possible so he can one day inherit his grandfathers wealth.",

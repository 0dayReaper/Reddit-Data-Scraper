    "postText": "Hi, I am an incoming freshman in civil engineering. I have all my classes picked out on the planner for my course schedule, but I cannot register for my classes without the RAN number. The only problem is that I can get my RAN without an advisor, which I do not have, according to access plus. Am I missing something, or do I just need to wait for freshman orientation?",

To prepare though, check out the \u201cfour year plan\u201d on the ISU website for civil and mark down the classes it says for first sem, and if you have any AP credits or CC transfer classes see if you have any of those completed already.\n\nI would recommend taking it easy and not going above what they say since you\u2019re gonna be busy figuring out how college works and making friends and stuff",

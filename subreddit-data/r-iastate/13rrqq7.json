Those are goated.\n\nI also agreed with what you said about brief bouts of strong focus being much better than longer bouts of distracted studying. I have been working on a page for increasing focus for those with sub-clinical attentional issues, or straight up diagnosed ADHD. I think the resources I've found are invaluable, so feel free to check it out here if you're interested: [https://www.notion.so/nickstreithealthresources/ADHD-Focus-Technology-Hygiene-Dopamine-and-Feeling-Motivated-e641ce9a378046438a021b5f50f2cec7](https://www.notion.so/nickstreithealthresources/ADHD-Focus-Technology-Hygiene-Dopamine-and-Feeling-Motivated-e641ce9a378046438a021b5f50f2cec7)\n\nLet me know what you think!",

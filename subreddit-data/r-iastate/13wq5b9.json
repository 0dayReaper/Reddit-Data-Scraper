Lectures are useful and interesting, however you can probably get away with just reading the textbook if you can't go to lecture. The class will be significantly harder if you choose to not go to lecture though, and I recommend that you try to.\n(Also, Sheaffer is a great professor and his classes in general are worth attending)",

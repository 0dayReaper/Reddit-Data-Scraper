Dude went to the risk manager, the person dedicated to this kind of thing, and the risk manager laughed at him. His entire job is to keep the frat out of the public eye and now he's on the news for SA. Nice one. \n\nIf y'all want the rest of the world to stop laughing at you then you have to start self policing.\nSomething like this comes up once every other week.",

At what point will people see that it\u2019s just a stereotype? The vast majority of frats have had no reports for over a decade, are they guilty too because it\u2019s convenient? Can all of ISU and colleges in general be condemned for the same reason all frats have to be?\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201cwe do good stuff *too*\u201d either. It\u2019s we do good stuff. Most literally don\u2019t do anything like what\u2019s reported at all but get dragged through the mud because people think of Animal House as a documentary on all frats or something.",

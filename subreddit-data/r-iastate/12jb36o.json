Is the old C++ version of CS227/CS228 compressed down to a single semester and skipping all the really basic concepts.  The killer here will be the homework... and all the \\*\\*\\*\\* that Java does for you that you now have to do for yourself. &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n\n**CS319** I didn't take, but I see it mentions UML and in my experience any class that mentions UML is dangerously boring.\n\n**CS362** See above.  This one I do remember.  UML is boring, the tests were hard because they were nitpicky, and the lecturer couldn't stop bringing up anecdotes about how she worked on the code for the Voyager probes.  And at least when I took it, it was in Gilman 1652 which is just a terrible classroom.  \n\n**CS331** is the second coming of CS311.",

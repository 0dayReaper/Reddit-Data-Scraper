I have an exam at 7:30am tomorrow morning and I missed the memo that I need two blue books for it. The bookstore doesn\u2019t open until 9am. \n\nDoes anyone have any I can have or know anywhere I can buy some tonight or any ideas what to do, because I\u2019m freaking out. I\u2019m willing to pay, I really can\u2019t fail my exam.\n\nThank you",

The department doesn't have funds for some Costco paper? I feel you, this is messed up. Unfortunately the only piece of advice I can give you is to take a screenshot of the book cover and back and scale it in a word doc so it is 8.5\"x7\" and then print it in color along with lined paper to match it. Trim off the excess and staple the middle together. If you need access to a color printer the go to the COD since it's open 24/7 and print off from the color printer by the elevator on the 4th floor. Just email it to yourself and access it from the open lab computers nearby the printer.",

Luckily I was able to find some at westside market, but I agree that this entire situation is really fucking stupid. Paper is paper, I shouldn\u2019t have to buy something to take my exam.",

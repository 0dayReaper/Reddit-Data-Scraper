    "postText": "I am a senior in high school, and considering both Iowa State University and DePaul. I would attend Iowa State because they offer me $43,969 for a year including living expenses, but DePaul is in Chicago (a big city) which is I will likely have more job/internship opportunities in Chicago and they offer $50,000 to me per year. However, I had been seeing that Iowa State's computer science major ranking is higher than DePaul's in many different sources. Is there anything special at Iowa State\u2019s computer science program that DePaul doesn\u2019t offer and which one should I choose? Thank you.",

I was there 05-10 and was able to work in town and got a 6 month co-op internship elsewhere. IA state does a great job of connecting with businesses to get internship opportunities. They also invented the first digital computer, but didn't get the patent because their lawyers are idiots.  \nAll things aside. Of friends who have degrees several chose by \"quality\" of education over other deciding factors and it didn't matter as much as their ability to succeed in the environment they were in.  \n\n* Do you feel safe on both campus's? \n* Do you have support? \n* Are you getting distracted by non-school things? \n\nEach of these questions can have a much bigger impact on your success then the quality of the school's education.",

I\u2019m about to graduate with my DS degree, but I\u2019ve taken my fair share of CS classes (207, 227, 228, 230, 311, 363, 424, 474, CPRE 419). Some professors are decent, but since this is a research university first and teaching university third, some instructors are absolutely horrible at it. If you\u2019re coming in with a decent CS background already, you\u2019ll be ok. If not, I\u2019m not so sure. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve learned a lot but that\u2019s mostly because I\u2019ve learned how to teach myself the material. \n\nInstructors also tend to throw students into the deep end without a life jacket with a lot of their assignments. Meaning, you\u2019ll be taught a basic overview of the material but you\u2019ll be put thrown into tasks you don\u2019t feel prepared for all the time. It really feels like you\u2019re constantly being tested on material you haven\u2019t been taught and that just gets exhausting after awhile. I understand that there are time constraints, but I\u2019ve come to disagree with this approach as a learning tool.",

All i know is they invented the digital computer at ISU and the CS program is highly regarded. I\u2019ll give you some insight into ISU/Ames as a whole that may aid you in your decision, but as others have said, either school would be fine and a degree from either would be attractive to prospective employers. Im in a different field obviously, but what I have found is many employers are more concerned with relevant experience than where your degree came from. Someone with a community college degree, but has a few years of relevant experience is often ranked higher than someone with a degree from a top university with no/very little actual job experience. If you can find a part-time job while you\u2019re in school that is in your field, that gives you a head start out of college in the job experience part of your resum\u00e9 and will likely get you hired quicker than your classmates who didn\u2019t work in college or worked in a different field than their degree. \n\nThe cost of living in Ames is wayyyyyy cheaper than Chicago, so your money would go much farther here. Campus is pedestrian-based here so you dont need a car. Cyride busses will take you just about anywhere in town you need to go and riding them is free as long as you can present your student ID. If you dont have a student ID I think its just a couple bucks per ride. There\u2019s an app that shows where the busses are and the time till their next stops and routes that makes it all super easy. \n\nISU has great career fairs to make connections and companies from all over the state come to recruit students. There may not be anywhere near the amount of job opportunities actually in ames as in chicago, but if you find a remote job, it is a great place to stay after college and eventually raise a family, or you can move somewhere else for work after graduating. Just 30 minutes south of here is the biggest job-hub in the state (Des Moines and its suburbs). There\u2019s quite a few job positions on-campus as well if you need to work while in school and they\u2019re more likely to be able to accommodate your class schedule than off-campus jobs and they tend to pay better than the mom and pop small businesses. Many fast food places and Walmart/Target/Hyvee are also *somewhat* accommodating to students. There\u2019s also lots of factory/warehouse jobs on the edges of town that pay quite a bit more and most dont require any education or prior training, but you\u2019d probably need a car or a ride from someone to go that route as i dont know if cyride goes all the way out to some of them. \n\nOverall Ames is a great place to live, you got pretty much anything you\u2019d need in terms of shopping and food and it only takes about 15 min to get from one side of town to the other. We get a lot of international students so ISU is really good about helping students who have moved from far away get settled in and if you end up w a local roommate or neighbor they\u2019ll gladly show you around town and show you all the interesting stuff to do. \n\nEither way you choose to go, best of luck in college!",

Not sure if you're from IL suburbs, but another thing to keep in mind is you may end up having lots of friends who commute from home at DePaul, which is a big cost saver, but also makes it a bit harder to make friends.   \n\nDePaul has less research activity, so if you want to go into academia ISU might be the better choice, but I don't think you'll be getting an education that is significantly better or worse at either.  \n\n I would guess they would have fewer companies that may come to their career fairs (?) Than ISU,  but you would have access to networking events across Chicago to make up for that.  \n\n In general IMO career-wise the school you go to doesn't matter much for CS (for industry at least), people will tell you it does but the specific US news rankings of your school mean hardly anything to recruiters in CS (unless maybe top 5-10 school, but even then it matters much less than other fields).  So I would ignore rankings in that respect personally and look at what environment you'd rather be in deep down, cost, logistics, etc.",

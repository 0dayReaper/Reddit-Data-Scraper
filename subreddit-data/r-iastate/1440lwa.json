    "postText": "Has anyone taken the course CL ST 273 in their freshman year? I have to take a class on humanities and was given only a few options to choose from, and this seemed the most interesting, but I'd like to know more about class workload and homework/assignments in this class. Also please give me other recommendations for fun easy humanities classes to take in the future.",

If you are a Percy Jackson fan, the mythology Rick Riordan taught in those books won\u2019t get you anywhere near an A as this class is way more tedious than it should. The topic is not hard, but this class is surprisingly difficult. Too much work for what is supposed to be an easy elective. \n\nAlso, cool username. I love the Grishaverse.",

The good thing is you only have to complete 3 credits from the IP list, 3 from diversity, and the remaining can be any from the SSH list",

You can always take it later too once you are in your sophomore year. I know lots of people who took 200 level history courses and enjoyed them. Definitely use the ISU schedule of [courses](https://classes.iastate.edu/) to see who is teaching a class you\u2019re thinking about taking and check the rate my professor website to see student experiences in that specific course with that professor.",

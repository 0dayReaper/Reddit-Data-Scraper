I would love to get one started here if there are enough people. At the least, it would be great to connect with others interested in the space.\n\nAnyone else interested in that stuff here?",

The only issue I have with it is it\u2019s more focused towards traditional entrepreneurship in my experience rather than like high-growth software/technology startups. Like Silicon Valley\n\nMaybe I\u2019m looking in the wrong places though",

If your GPA is good enough, I would personally try for a T25/T40. Even a \u201clesser\u201d UC will be substantially better equipped. Of course, nothing\u2019s impossible! Though it may be more like a severely uphill battle in a blizzard compared to a Stanford student\u2019s downhill stroll. I am somewhat familiar with what you\u2019re talking about and would love to chat. My cousin is a founder from an Ivy, can maybe shine some light?",

Like if its to start one then you could totally find like minded people with a variety of skills if you look around, and theres the pappajon center and innovation stuff in the SIC for getting help with the business side of things like venture capital and patents and whatnot. \n\nIt\u2019s true you\u2019d probably find more people interested in that kind of thing at some other schools, but I\u2019ve encountered plenty of people who have taken various steps towards what you speak of in my few years here. \n\nIt is tough right now though as the hayday of VCs flinging money around has dried up considerably with the changing monetary policy and overall market conditions.",

    "postText": "Hi guys! I'm planning on testing out of MATH150, and I'd like to know if anybody that's tested out could give me an insight into how difficult it is. I've taken plenty of math classes throughout high school and think I should be okay testing out. I was planning to put in a little bit of studying over the summer, but I was wondering if anyone had any idea if the test was multiple choice or short answer? And if there are any study guides available? Any sort of help is appreciated!",

Here are the scores needed to start in various spots https://math.iastate.edu/academics/undergraduate/aleks/placement/ \n\nIf you attended a reasonably competent HS and took the usual sequence of courses and paid attention you should have no trouble skipping 150 with a few good hours of review.  Especially as you can retake the exam some number of times.",

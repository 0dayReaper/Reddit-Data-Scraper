    "postText": "Hey guys I\u2019m wondering if anyone wanted to lease my apt in clock tower for next year, it\u2019s in campus town and it\u2019s a 2bd 1bth third floor apt that looks over AJ\u2019s! It\u2019s going for 1350/month (you can rent just one room, but you\u2019ll need another person). Please lmk if you\u2019re really interested then I can send you pics of the place and maybe do a walkthrough as well.",

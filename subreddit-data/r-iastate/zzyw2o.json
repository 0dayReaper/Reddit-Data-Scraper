    "postText": "I started working remotely over break, and while I have a decent setup at home, I would rather not bounce back and forth between home and campus once classes begin. I like to work out on campus in the morning, and my classes are in the afternoon. \n\nThe nature of my job makes it difficult to work off of one monitor. Is there a lab or other space on campus with dual monitors that I would be able to hook up to a hub for my laptop? I feel like unplugging stuff is discouraged, and connections are usually under desks. I could make one monitor work with my laptop as a second screen, but I prefer a dual setup. Also, a place I could talk on my headset without distracting others would probably be ideal, but I don't take calls enough for it to be a huge deal.",

            "comment": "I know you said you would rather be on campus but finding a private area would be tough. Library has double monitors but is always busy. Study rooms would be good, but you can only book them for 2 hours a day. There are several major specific rooms with computers but you have to have that major and is normal quiet.\n\nIf you want to stay on campus would suggest using your laptop and buying a portable monitor. This way you can go anywhere on campus and aren\u2019t bound to a specific location.\n\nOtherwise there is a coworking space downtown Ames. Pay for a monthly membership and full of other people doing the same thing you are, so you wouldn\u2019t be bothering anyone. Even comes with free snacks and coffee which is a plus. Get done with work, grab a quick bite since you are already downtown, catch the red bus and head straight to campus.",

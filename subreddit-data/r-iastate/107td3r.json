Anything else like that close to campus? Also, are people allowed/willing to sell one of theirs to me?",

If you drive a lot you can try parking in commuter or staff lots on campus such as the ones north of university off of stange. You wouldn\u2019t need a pass for overnight there but they do require you to move your vehicle before I think 7 am if you don\u2019t have a pass. You may be able to purchase a pass for the paid commuter lots in which case you could leave your car there. I\u2019ve seen vehicles parked there for weeks at a time that have passes.",

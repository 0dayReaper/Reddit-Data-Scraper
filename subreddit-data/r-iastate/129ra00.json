    "postText": "I have finished my time here at Iowa State but I wanted to pass something along to everyone else.\n\nCALCULUS MADE EASY by SILVANUS P. THOMPSON published in 1910 is a fantastic resource to learn calculus.\n\nIMO it makes way more sense than current text books today. \n\nThe verbiage from the 1910 version is a little dated but the explanations and mathematics are still solid. \n\nHopefully this makes Calc 1 a little easier for my fellow engineers and everyone else as well! \n\nhttps://calculusmadeeasy.org/\n\nEDIT: The updated 1955 version of this book is available at the library as well! Along with MANY of their other books on many other topics such as physics \n\nhttps://quicksearch.lib.iastate.edu/permalink/01IASU_INST/q0r84t/cdi_hathitrust_hathifiles_uc1_c106030943\n\nHere is a ISU library query for all books published by them. They also have some pretty neat lectures! \n\nhttps://quicksearch.lib.iastate.edu/discovery/search?query=any,contains,SILVANUS%20P.%20THOMPSON&amp;tab=Everything&amp;search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&amp;vid=01IASU_INST:01IASU&amp;mfacet=tlevel,include,online_resources,1&amp;mfacet=tlevel,include,open_access,1&amp;mfacet=rtype,include,books,1&amp;mfacet=lang,include,eng,1&amp;offset=0&amp;came_from=pagination_2_1",

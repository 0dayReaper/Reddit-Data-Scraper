    "postText": "ITS is planning an update to the devices that power the WiFi in the dorms on Wednesday, February 22nd from 6:00am to 8:00am. Assuming all goes according to plan, there should be 2 10-minute periods of internet loss towards the beginning of the maintenance window. This includes devices plugged into the wired ports on the bottom of the access points, but does not include those in Freddy Ct or Buchanan that have paid to activate the wired Ethernet jack in their bedroom.\n\nSee [this link](https://status.it.iastate.edu/maintenances/81536) for the official announcement",

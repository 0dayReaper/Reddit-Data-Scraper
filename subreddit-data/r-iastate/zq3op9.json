    "postText": "Tldr: taking cybe 331, cpre 381, cs 309; is it easier to take diff eq (at scott community/DMACC) or calc 3 (at Scott community) or lin alg (at DMACC)?\n\nI plan on taking CPR E 381, CYB E 331 and  COM S 309, and I was wondering if I should take diff eq before math elective (calc 3 or lin alg). I plan to take these at a community college as last semester I  took Calc 2 at Scott community college. I really liked the professor and she also teaches calc 3 this upcoming semester. However, everyone says lin alg is easier which DMACC offers. I can Diffeq at either. Can anyone can attest that lin alg at DMACC was easy, if its self pace or live lecture, if the classwork and exams were brutal or am I better off sticking with calc 3? I get math is hard but the less classwork needed means more time for my 3 other problem solving classes. I appreciate any feedback :)",

The material is interesting and worth learning, however his teaching did not make it learning easier. I probably could have taught myself better, his accent and chalkboard writing for 50 minutes straight every single lecture didn\u2019t work well for me. You either pay attention and learn quickly or write quickly and don\u2019t take in what he\u2019s rapidly saying with a heavy accent. I would avoid him for Linear algebra if you take it at ISU.",

If they were to teach Diff Eq from the beginning, everything in Calc 1 &amp; 2 becomes trivial.",

It may be even easier at DMACC, but the drop down in difficulty is likely larger for calc 3 or diff eq.\n\nI did technically take Calc 1 and 2 at Scott. Took calc 2 again at ISU to brush up and it was much harder.",

Those math classes are known to all be easier than Calculus 2 at Iowa State which people usually take at a community college. However, if you don't care about spending more money, math is always easier at a community college and as long as you pass, you get credit and it won't count in your GPA.",

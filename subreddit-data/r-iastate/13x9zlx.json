    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm a sophomore majoring in Aerospace engineering and I'm taking ME 231, MAT E 273, and CE 274 in Fall'23. Who are the best professors for the above courses? In terms of good teaching style and ease of understanding. Since all three are hard classes, I want to have good professors.\n\nI've heard that Hosting and Minor are good professors for Statics (CE 274).\n\nThanks!",

You basically watch a short video before every lecture and then he goes through some really tough examples in class. \n\nHe does go really fast because he wants to get through as much as possible and doesn't waste time. If you put in the work (this isn't calculus or physics anymore it's more difficult) and talk to him when you have questions you will do well in the class.",

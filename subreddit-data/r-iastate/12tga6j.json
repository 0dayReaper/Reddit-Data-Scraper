    "postText": "Going into my Sophomore year in M E, I need 3 SS credits and don't know what classes to take. I'm looking at M E 220 / Globe 220 and maybe Phych 101, but I have no clue what the lab would look like. I also am looking into Agron 342 but have heard the homework takes a while. Any good classes that are relatively easy and preferably online?\n\n(For context, I have all IP / H credits covered)",

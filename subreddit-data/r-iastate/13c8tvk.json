    "postText": "I'm taking 2 accounting classes this summer, one is the first 4 weeks of summer and the other is the last 4 weeks. a 3 credit class seems pretty intense for 4 weeks, but i need it to graduate.  is this like a weekly exam thing with just non stop homework or are the classes condensed down?  I'm not a great student and I'm doing a full time internship this summer as well.  just wondering if anyone has any experience, and if i should be mentally prepared to start hard next monday.",

I've taken two summer classes and both of them were 3-4 hours a day minimum of commitment, with required lectures and/or lab every day during normal working hours.\n\nIt was a homework or lab report due every weekday for the 4 credit lab course and I think 3 homeworks a week for the 3 credit course. Remember, it's 12 weeks of content condensed into 4.\n\nBoth courses were electrical engineering courses, so it may be handled differently in your department.",

Those get stolen everywhere since they\u2019re hard to track and high value. \n\nI\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not like you leave your hat on a table and it\u2019s gone in five minutes. Where I\u2019m from you could leave class to go to the bathroom and some of your stuff would be gone when you got back because your classmates took it. That kinda stuff doesn\u2019t happen here",

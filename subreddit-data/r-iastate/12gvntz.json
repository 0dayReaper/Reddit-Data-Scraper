They\u2019re also the best located dorms on campus, along with Helser and Friley. They are suite styles, though, so they are more expensive. As someone who lives in Friley (not quiet at all), a pair of over ear headphones has saved me and I haven\u2019t had many issues.",

The campus is close enough to most dorms to where you can study on campus and still get home fairly quickly. I also found studying in my dorm room was less impactful and had more distractions than somewhere on campus like the TLA.",

Ended up being awesome though, and when I needed to study I did it at other places on campus. The library, student innovation center etc. are open until 2am and most dorms have decent 24hr study rooms",

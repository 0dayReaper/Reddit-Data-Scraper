Was informed by the college of engineering that I was no longer a student there; was able to get accepted by the college of ag and finish out my program.  I had to take a few classes over the summer to help boost my GPA a bit, but I was able to get it done.  Major went from Ag Engineering to Ag Systems Technology.  Graduated the following spring.\n\nGet with your advisor NOW.  They are the only ones that can really help you - they will know all of the options available to you.",

But, it will not fix the grade-point of someone who is not willing to do the work, focus, and study. I have seen a number of students who believe that all they need to do is pay tuition, Chegg their way through courses, and the University owes them a degree and the workplace owes them a decent job. That rarely seems to work out well.\n\nCollege is serious stuff, and a number of folks are not capable of the responsibility. I think the biggest mistake is to run up student loans or spend your parents money and end up with no degree or a degree with minimal job prospects. Some time off working or a stint in the military might help these folks mature.",

Like I said, it has been two decades since I graduated now, but I want to say part of the college of ag's requirements for accepting me was I had to get my GPA up before the fall semester, so I ended up taking two classes over the summer - entomology and........something..... Both were online courses, and I had to drive to Ames once a week for tests in one of them.  It was a pain in the ass, but it was the wake up I needed - I went from academic probation and flunking out of my program, to almost making the deans list spring semester.\n\nI want to say the official letter I got from the college of engineering stated something to the effect of \"You are no longer a student of the college of engineering, and unless you can be accepted into another college, you will no longer be a student of Iowa State University\"",

To get here, you had to be put on academic warning and probation which means you didn\u2019t improve. right now, take the semester off, recalibrate, set your priorities. Figure out if the major you want to pursue will work for you. *Maybe* try DMACC and peck away at a class or two. Try to find some sort of job over the summer and fall to help with bills and keep you busy. \n\nFor future you: it\u2019s been so long that it happened to me, so I don\u2019t remember how to process works. But when you reapply, you should have to fill out an explanation about what\u2019s changed. Make sure to detail what you\u2019ve done in the meantime and what steps you have taken to make sure that your education is a priority for you, and what steps you will take to make sure you will be successful if reaccepted (utilize office hours, tutoring, ISU resources, counseling, etc.)\n\nHere is my story:\n&gt; I\u2019ve had a wild ride here at Iowa State, so I hope this story finds you well. Sometimes it takes a lot of life experience along with growing up a little bit to find what you want to do. I think you can do it.\nI started out at Iowa State in Software Engineering. I started out okay, but things snowballed towards the end of my first semester and I decided that I would rather play GTA5 all day and party the night before exams rather than put in the effort. I got a 1.3GPA my first semester, and dropped out.\nI decided college wasn\u2019t for me, so I moved back home and got a job as a welder. It only took 4 months of working 3:30pm-2:00am 4 days a week to decide that I couldn\u2019t do that the rest of my life. So I moved back.\n&gt;I moved to Kinesiology where I was actually doing okay; I had about a B average but halfway through the semester I developed pneumonia and was out of school for 3 weeks. I missed quizzes and exams, professors just weren\u2019t working with me, and I was so far behind on the material that I decided it would be better if I withdrew and try again next semester.\n&gt;I transferred to the College of Business after that, and pursued a degree in Management. I bought the book \u201cHow to Be A Straight A Student\u201d by Cal Newport, and used that as my bible. Although it wasn\u2019t nearly as difficult as Engineering, the principles I learned from the book helped me with my balance between working over 40 hours per week at CyRide along with full time class. I used resources like office hours and made the investment to buy a subscription to Chegg to supplement my learning (100% worth it.)\n6 years from when I first came to ISU, here I am. I just finished my last exam ever yesterday, and got a 4.0 this semester. My major GPA is about a 3.75; my overall GPA will be about a 3.3 due to some transfer credits and that first bad semester. I had some struggles along the way and have spent god knows how much on energy drinks, but I\u2019m done. It took a lot of effort, dedication, and saying \u201cno\u201d to parties every once in a while, but I came back. So can you.",

Going to college for no reason without any passion or reason to want to attend class is going to lead you to underperform.\n\nAlso, if your parents are paying for everything then it may be you don't grasp the monetary value that is being put into your education. You had said you got fired from the dining center so it seems like your lack of motivation pertains to more than just school, such as having to work.\n\nI can't tell you exactly what your problem is, and honestly part of me wants to say you're just lazy, but it could always be something deeper like an attention disorder. You could try signing up for a campus therapy session to talk out your problems with someone that specializes in the mental health field and see if that gets you anywhere.",

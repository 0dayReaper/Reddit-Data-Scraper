Some are automatic consideration by the office of admissions, they have some for international students. There\u2019s a website called OneApp where you can apply for any additional scholarships at ISU so I also recommend you fill out as many as you can on there in hopes you get something.\n\nHope this helps! If you have any further questions lmk",

Definitely make sure your heat works though, we have the occasional day of -35 to -50 wind chills in the winter (rare but has happened at least one day the last 5ish yrs in a row)",

Additionally all other buildings on campus are air conditioned as well so during a particularly hot day you can escape to those. \n\nIt typically cools down significantly at night although the humidity doesn't go away, keep track of the humidity and temperature and open your windows when it gets cold or dry outside to keep your indoor temps nice. Additionally do not open your blinds during hot days as this will have a SIGNIFICANT effect on heating by the sun especially with a sun facing window.\n\nThe temperature typically become very pleasant a few weeks after the semester starts and currently, it's not forecasted to exceed 80F before the end of the semester so not much of your time spent here will be ones you'd typically need AC for.",

As someone who has gone through a summer without an AC, staying on campus is the best and nights will require baths and a fan right in your face.\nHaving a heater will be much more important in the fall and spring.",

During the hot months, I spend almost all of my time in the air conditioned common room when I\u2019m at the dorm. I have a 16\u201d fan tied to the corner of my bed to blow across me when I\u2019m sleeping. We have a box fan in the window for circulation. It\u2019s absolutely an issue but most of the year it\u2019s cool enough that it doesn\u2019t matter at all, and honestly having to be in the common room all the time at the start of the year means my dorm has an exceptionally strong community. Is there a particular dorm you\u2019re looking at?",

            "comment": "I took it last summer with Tathagata Basak, but it doesn't look like he is teaching it this summer. Since it's a 4 cr. course, there's a lot of work: 3-4 homeworks per week on Pearson MyMathLab, 5 written quizzes and 3 written exams overall. We basically had either a quiz or an exam due each week.  \nGood thing is that it was all online, so open notes but the difficulty was also set accordingly. I loved the professor and the course, it was so much better than Calc I/II for me. Just going by my friends who took it during spring/fall, I think summer might be easier.",

Any community college would be good too and although everywhere is 8 weeks they have different start dates mine is 6/5 so Iowa state is fucked for starting tomorrow. Most common CC around here for diff eq are Iowa Western, Eastern Iowa (Clinton), and DMACC",

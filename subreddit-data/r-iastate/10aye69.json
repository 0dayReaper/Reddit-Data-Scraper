    "postText": "One year ago I had a Cumulative GPA of 2.5. It was rough and I was close to dropping engineering. My parents convinced me to give it one more semester and I had my first good semester, a 3.35 (I know that\u2019s probably not impressive to many). Then I got an A in ENGL 250 over summer which In combination with the 3.35 semester brought me to a 2.8 cumulative. Then this last fall I really got to work. Ended up getting a 3.82 with 17 credits and now I\u2019m finally above a 3.0 at 3.04. It is not easy but if you are worried about your GPA and if you can get it high enough, you definitely can. I mean shit I did it and I\u2019m really not that good at school IMO. My other strat was that I never sacrificed sleep for anything. 8 hours a night every night, unless there was homework that went really late and was very very important. I would rather be rested and clear of mind and have studied as much as I could, than be really tired but got through everything.",

But once I did, I really excelled, and was promoted as an engineering manager of a department within 3 years of working there.\n\nSchool has absolutely zero bearing on how successful you'll be, just get through it. Working life is soooooo easy. Like unbelievably so.",

                    "comment": "First thing I should say is I do not work during school so that is a complication. This most recent semester I would wake up an hour or 1.5 hours before my first class. I don\u2019t tend to do good work or much work within 2 hours of waking up. I would go to class and if I had more than 45 mins between classes I would work on homework. I completed all assignments 1-3 days early depending on how they align with the lecture topics (I also attend every class unless it\u2019s easy to watch online). My Tuesday\u2019s and Thursdays were pretty dead so I would do 6-9 hours of the weeks homework on those two days mainly. I would also study lecture topics I didn\u2019t understand when I had free time during the day so I didn\u2019t fall behind. \n\nI would study for tests for 4-10 hours each depending on the class, with the exception of Thermodynamics 2 because my thermo 1 prof taught me most of that stuff anyway lol. I never studied past 10:30PM as my brain seems to stop working right and I miss easy stuff and make simple errors every problem. I don\u2019t have a go to study strat either I just kinda go with the flow. \n\nThe way I see it, college is like a funny reverse job. I pay money to work. I treat it like a job where if I get my work done I will spend extra time reviewing and answering questions I have about lecture topics. My main rule only being that if possible always try to get enough sleep. \n\nSaturday was my off day and I mostly would game or hang out with my friends. Sunday was also a bit like Tuesday or Thursday since not much ever happens on sundays I could do a TON of work if I needed too. But to avoid burn out I typically didn\u2019t go crazy on sundays. \n\nOverall I like to have days where I do mostly class and down days with only 1 or 2 classes and time for lots of work. I spend 8-9 hours a day on average each week on school, which includes class, HW, and studying. Always try to keep good sleep, and have one rest day a week if possible. My best advice for the HW is do a topic right after the lecture and not before the due date. I feel like if something\u2019s fresh from lecture and I do the practice in the HW quickly it cements in my memory better than if I have to go back and check my notes a trillion times.",

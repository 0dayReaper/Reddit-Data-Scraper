I\u2019ve been feeling lost on my major despite enjoying the courses within the College of Design, but I am a bit nervous of career and internship opportunities. \n\nI thankfully have a full ride, but it\u2019s been getting to me that I might not be taking full advantage of it. (The majors I\u2019m the most intrigued by aren\u2019t as profitable in the long run).\n\nI\u2019m looking to branch out at other majors with more opportunities, (it doesn\u2019t help I\u2019m curious about everything and how things work consistently) but they don\u2019t interest me too much in comparison. Even with this opportunity, I\u2019m still so uncertain!\n\nI also think my issue is that I\u2019m not too exposed to what a lot STEM majors/careers did growing up. Like for engineering, I never been around people within that field and always have been pushed to do art and design instead.\n\nEdit: I should also mention that my current major is Integrated Studio Arts with a minor in Digital Media. (But considering a psychology minor too).",

There WILL be good opportunities for jobs in design, although they may be a bit harder to find, but if it\u2019s what you enjoy doing it\u2019s probably better to stick to that.\n\nBut at the end of the day, keep talking to people in both majors, talk to advisors to hear what they think as well, maybe you will find something that you like just as much or even more than what you do now. Even if you don\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t hurt to at least look for different opportunities",

(Though growing up in poverty makes it more of a necessity).\n\nI have discussed this issue with my advisor, but it made it more difficult admittedly. They kept showcasing me other majors and what they do, and it added to the already long list of ones I find curiosity for and research obsessively about. \n\nThey did offer to look into career services, so I will most definitely do that after break!",

(Though I love how industrial design you can do more to change the lives of others through designing a variety of objects, and can really be more affective for accessibility).",

I didn't want to go fully stem and give up my creative side (later learned that there are many ways to apply art/design to stem), so I found something called BPMI\n\nhttps://www.bpmi.iastate.edu/\n\nWhile the focus is going on to grad school to be a medical illustrator, many students apply the skills this interdisciplinary major provides to a variety of careers. Some go into computer fields, others research fields, others art fields.\n\nThere's a focus on hyper realism in the curriculum, but you can take more free-form courses and if you have an ambition (I wanted to go into the entertainment industry) then focus on building skills for that.\n\nIts an intense major and im going to be honest, finding a career after requires you to think outside the box and really sell yourself. But it opens the door for you to be the bridge between both creatives and academics, as a huge skill from this major is to illustrate advanced concepts for different audiences.",

            "comment": "Coming from a Senior in ISA, I think you should stick with it! You can still take introductory courses geared towards other majors too. Or you could do Art and Design, which is a sister major to ISA, and has a lot more flexibility with it (allowing you to take even more classes geared towards other majors). If you're still unsure about job security / income, I'd reccomend going the graphic design route with a minor in illustration. I'm sure having more options doesn't make it easier, but it's good to know what all is available to you. All in all, stick with what you're passionate about, because a lifetime of doing something you don't care for is gonna suck bigtime. Having a full ride is the perfect opportunity to do what you love rather than what's profitable. If you have more questions about ISA, feel free to message me!",

            "comment": "I faced a very similar struggle when I started at ISU. I have been drawing my whole life and running a small commission-based digital art business since high school. When I started college, I initially wanted to make art a full-time career by majoring in Industrial Design or Integrated Studio Arts. However, my Dad is a chemical engineer and pushed me to pursue a STEM major.I chose to pursue Mechanical Engineering since there are so many routes and jobs you can do as an ME (including design) for the following reasons:\n\n1. With an engineering degree, you would be able to comfortably afford to do art as a hobby\n2. Your hobby does not become your job, which prevents burnout and ultimately resenting your work\n3. You don't have to get a degree in art to make money off of your art\n\nHowever, any engineering degree takes serious commitment, and you need to be interested in engineering, or you will have a very hard time in your courses. ISU provides many great resources to succeed as an engineer, but you need to put just as much effort into taking advantage of those resources. The ME program and faculty are some of the best the university offers, and I couldn't recommend it enough!   \n\n\nI wish you the best of luck and hope you have a great time at ISU!",

I can take multiple suggestions since I can pick up to 12. I'm also looking to make friend's and meet people so nothing too antisocial or else I probably won't talk to anyone.",

            "comment": "I lived in helser all of freshman year and got a good idea of how each of the union drive dorms felt like. Friley is a mostly quiet dorm. Some houses are noisy but everything is so spread out that in order to talk to people you have to find them first. The old hall also doesn't bode well bathroom wise. Martin and Eton are the good dorms. Private bathrooms but shared living quarters mean you will become good friends with those you live with, but a bad match leads to a bad experience. Single dorms are best for putting your nose to the grindstone. Now helser, helser is a whole other beast. Most freshman it has a party atmosphere most weekends and was a ton of fun to socialize. No ac means that people huddle in the dens early in the semester and get to know each other really well. This of course comes with downsides as especially as a junior you are gonna get hard classes and need to focus at 12 a night rather than investigating why chuck down the hall is cry/laughing on a wensday night. Random roommate is also luck of the draw, and if at all possible, find someone you can halfway tolerate before transferring. Most people doing random roommates are either freshman or desperate. Try to find where your classes are going to be and pick a close dorm. It's that or learn the bus route. I can give more insight on other dorms too.",

This increases the chances you will have classes with your roomate and can help weed out deadbeats. As far as I know there isn't any specific thing to request someone in your year but it might be worth sending a email to housing services. Your best chance might be rooming with a freshman though to keep it as random and even as possible.",

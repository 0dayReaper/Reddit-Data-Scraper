    "postText": "Hi, I currently enroll in Physics II at NWICC and somehow I made a mess with Canvas account. I did not set up the password (it\u2019s not what the help desk gave). And more stupidly, I deleted the google authentication account after scan the QR code, therefore, I could not pass the Multi-factor Authentication. Is there any recommendations for this situation? I would really appreciate that. Thank you. \n(The reason I do not use phone number is that I\u2019m outta US now).",

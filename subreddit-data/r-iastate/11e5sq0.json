What are you guys experiences living on campus, also I\u2019m an international student if that would make in difference.",

All of us have different religions (atheist, Catholic, Jewish, Christian, and Hindi). We all still get along amazingly well, and are a very close group. From what I\u2019ve seen your time in the dorms depends both on you and the people you get stuck with. Most of us were freshman when we moved in and looking for friends, so some of us just started hanging around the common areas constantly the first few weeks. A lot of other houses didn\u2019t do that and had a lot less of a community environment or close-knit group. I personally loved the dorms, but I understand it\u2019s not for everybody. If that does sound like something you would want then go for it, you never know who you might meet!",

We didn't become the best of friends because of the language barrier, but we were friendly and she left me notes on postcards she brought from home. She picked up a few slang phrases of mine and it was adorable. I kind of loved the experience.\n\nYou will find people on campus to bond with - it doesn't have to be your roommate, but they might be on your floor. If it is bad enough to be intolerable for you, there are solutions. It's scary for everyone to be honest.",

That way you\u2019ll be able to explore your options and meet more new people than you would in an apartment. \n\nThe walls in the dorms are thin and I have extremely loud neighbors, but they don\u2019t really bother me when I have headphones on, which are a must. They will also quiet down if I ask them to nicely. \n\nIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re being critical, but sometimes the same issues that come from dorms can appear when living in apartment.

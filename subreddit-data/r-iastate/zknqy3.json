I am not sure where to work but Ik the extra money would be nice to have and keep me busy during the school year. \n\nI have been thinking about working at the tech lending in parks library, but I can\u2019t find anything online about it. Can someone help me where to find it or have any job opportunities on campus.",

            "comment": "The tech landing, IT solution center will be the best paying in terms of on campus jobs and they are very flexible with schedule as well. I worked there for a year and was very satisfied. You should be able to find the open roles on Access plus student job board. You can also just walk up to the office and ask someone if there is a open role available for winter break.",

            "comment": "Any job in IT is amazing and easy for student workers. I would recommend a SSG or student systems support job instead of tech lending simply for the fact that it\u2019s less busy I.E more time for homework. Also you can only work from 8-5 Mon-Fri, so you have more time for friends and weekends/afternoons will always be open. \n\nSometimes I see tech lending in the library at like 10pm and think \u201cman that must suck\u201d",

As much as other jobs don't take much of my brain power, I'd rather work and learn tbh. It's also great to talk about in career fairs and interviews.",

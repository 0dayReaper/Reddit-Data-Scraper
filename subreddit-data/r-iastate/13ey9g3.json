I chose SE and thankfully K love this route and am happy I picked it, but looking back I think CPRE would've been the smartest route since I wasn't sure. \n\nYou cover both software and hardware classes during the CPRE load and its easy to switch to full EE or SE from CPRE if you decide you wanna purse one of those routes more deeply. I think CPRE at ISU is one of the best degrees you can get at college as you learn an intense amount and can go to such a huge range of careers with it.",

You will also take mandatory SE core classes also. It all depends on the person. If you really enjoy hardware, or not, you have options. I would recommend doing all core classes first, and COMS 227, CPRE 281, and the EE circuits class. These three are all different and will count towards each degree for the most part.",

    "postText": "Hello my fellow cyclones. Do you ever remember a obscure drink in the aisle next to the coke products that was Apple Fanta Soda? It seems it sold in the states for a while but it has gone almost extinct. I\u2019m wondering if anyone knows of this product or knows if it can be purchased around the area. \nThank You",

Sometimes they'll do limited runs of flavors as a promotional thing, sometimes they'll roll out new products in January and maintain them for the whole fiscal year to see how they sell. More than likely, it got discontinued. Was probably before my time with the company.",

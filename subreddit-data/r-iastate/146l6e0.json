Send an email or talk after class to the professors that you want to do research with. You won\u2019t get a yes from all of them as they may not have the budget/space for an undergrad but they should at least let you know when they will have the capacity for an undergrad. \n\nAlso, there may be department specific grants and programs that allow undergrads to do research. Im not familiar with comp sci so I can\u2019t help you there but some google searching might turn something up.",

Work with them to market to more women, try to get a girls only night on the schedule, etc. and then try to create a women's wrestling club when you have the numbers that demand a little more resources. Or just go straight to the club office and see what they say about the whole idea. Either way I love the idea! I've been sending emails to Jamie pollard the last 15 months or so since Iowa added their women's program trying to convince him that we need to be exploring the same move, but maybe if you get a women's club going that would be a great first step in that direction!",

The club team at my time was actually part of the ncwa which already had collegiate women\u2019s wrestling. I would definitely try to reach out to them!",

    "postText": "I was at a career fair last fall and SpaceX was there, so I threw in my resume because why not? Had a handful of super discombobulated phone interviews and after not hearing from them for over a month they offered me a job for this summer. I was planning on studying abroad this summer, but I'm wondering if this is an offer I shouldn't pass up. Is anyone else in here planning on working for them this summer or has worked there before that would be willing to answer some questions I have?",

            "comment": "Without you providing any context on the position, or your education, it's hard to say. However, the value of SpaceX alone on your resume will give you an edge for many years. But if you don't really want to do it, then don't and study abroad, since you won't really get another chance to that. Let them offer the internship to someone who wants it more than you, if that's the case.",

I would be working with the power systems and microgrid SpaceX has that powers their production facilities, launchpad, offices, etc. I can always study abroad next summer after I graduate with my masters in may of 24, but I won't be eligible for the scholarship that would pay for it next summer, as I will no longer be an undergrad student then. So the choice between mostly free study abroad this semester or making a lot of money at SpaceX is difficult.",

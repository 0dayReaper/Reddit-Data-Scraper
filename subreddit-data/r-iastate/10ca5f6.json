            "comment": "TLDR: Great professor. Fun course. Not too difficult, just lots of work. Math reviews are provided in case you forgot diff eq or didn't learn it well :).\n\nI took ME 421 with Professor Schafbuch and really enjoyed the course. Prof. Schafbuch is super nice and also a great lecturer. He was a controls engineer for Emerson, so he has quite a few industrial insights to offer as well. The course involves modeling systems with differential equations and some fun mathematical manipulations. Prof. Schafbuch did a pretty good job of explaining problem solving processes. He provided reviews of all the math we needed to solve problems. Homework and practices reflected exams pretty well. You have to put in a fair amount of work to do well. \n\nLab was a lot easier and more organized than labs for Fluids and Heat Transfer. The TA would give us helpful mini lectures to help us with the math and important concepts. Lab reports were mostly just compilations of Matlab code and outputs. There was one written lab report, but it wasn't too bad. \n\nAfter putting in a lot of work in class and lab, I managed to get an A. \n\nTips for getting that A:\n- Go to all lectures and take notes\n- Use the shortcuts the professor gives on exams (otherwise you may not have time to finish)\n- Do all the written HW \n- Do any practice available (even if it is not graded)\n- Find a buddy to compare HW answers with\n- Go to office hours if you're a bit lost\n- Pay attention in lab\n\nEdit: Explaining that OP is probably not doomed.",

Like problem-solving shortcuts for certain problem types?\n\nAlso, I have a pretty packed semester, is the homework load similar to any other courses to compare to?",

If you know Matlab, it should be a breeze. It's a bit harder than instrumentation lab, but really well organized.\n\nI had to spend a significant amount of time outside of class on homework. I'm a little slow though. Collaborating with others might speed up the process.",

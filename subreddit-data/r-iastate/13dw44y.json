I had some medical issues after I applied and they lowered my grade pretty bad and I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t be able to receive the Journey Award for South Dakota. It was really going to help us pay and I\u2019m kind of worried if I\u2019ll be able to go without it.",

If you are concerned, you can always try reaching out to the Financial Aid Office and seeing what they have to say with your extenuating circumstances. Best of luck!",

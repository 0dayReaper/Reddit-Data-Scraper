    "postText": "So I\u2019m a freshman in Electrical Engr. right now, but I\u2019m thinking of switching. Honestly, I\u2019m not having that good of a time, and I think that I might be better off in Music. I wrote that off originally because I was told I \u201cwouldn\u2019t make any money\u201d but honestly I\u2019ve finally hit the point where I\u2019m not enjoying any of my classes and don\u2019t have any job aspirations no matter how hard I tried.\n\nI\u2019m working to a music tech minor right now, and I\u2019m enjoying that, and I have a lot of experience in music theory and piano, so I\u2019m thinking about switching over to Composition. I\u2019m looking at all the classes and honestly I think I\u2019d have a much better time in that. \n\nBasically I\u2019m just putting this out here to ask for any words of advice or stories from people in similar situations. Anything would be appreciated, so thanks in advance.\n\nTL;DR I\u2019m thinking of switching from Electrical Engr. to Music Composition. I\u2019m not happy with my major and I think this is what I want to do. Any advice/thoughts?",

You won't make loads of money, but it's achievable. There are plenty of music education majors at Iowa State who can fill you in.\n\n2) Working in the music industry - this is going to involve moving to a major city like New York, LA, or another major entertainment hub. There's not a huge pipeline from Iowa State specifically for this, but it's still doable with the right connections.\n\n3) music academia - if you are the kind of person who can see yourself in academia your whole life, and feel driven to do it, this is again possible.\n\n4) being a freelance composer/musician - this is a hard path. You won't be able to support yourself only by making music for a long time. That's not to say it's impossible, but it will take years of grinding. There are a number of YouTubers that are also musicians that can give some helpful perspective on this. For composition specifically, you might be interested in this video by David Bruce that reflects on his career as a composer: https://youtu.be/5Yyr33E4BV4\n\nIf none of these seem appealing - you can still be a musician or composer on a part-time basis. I'm an IT guy during the week and a church organist on the weekends, and that's great for me.",

I loved music as much as the next guy, and almost studied opera (before I moved here to go to school), and ultimately decided to go with engineering (not electrical). The job prospects in the music industry is just so competitive, and can be super draining if you\u2019re not  extremely dedicated. \n\nI work with musicians for my remote job, and it might be part of the reason I really don\u2019t want to go into the field. If you\u2019re not doing production, you\u2019ll probably end up as a teacher. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re doing theatre, so luckily you probably won\u2019t end up working at a grocery store like a lot of my theatre major friends did. \n\nMy partner and I have opted to have music be a hobby, and make money so we can buy pretty much any music equipment we could ever need. \n\nObviously do what makes you happy \u2014 ultimately you do not need to force yourself to do something you don\u2019t enjoy, life is too short for that. Just wanted to offer my perspective since I\u2019ve been in your position before.",

I would also recommend looking at other engineering majors as well, as you may find something such as construction or chemical engineering to be interesting. This would save you time and money as some courses would transfer over. But if you do go with music composition, try to find people in both electrical engineering and music comp careers to find a better idea of what it is like before you switch. This is what I am currently doing as I consider switching from AerE to CivE.",

I don't know every detail of your situation, so take from this what you will.   \nYou'll be advised to either switch majors to your passion now if your grades are suffering because it will cost you financially/in time, or to push yourself through the curriculum if you are doing well enough to graduate. After graduating, you can pursue the music stuff as a hobby and being able to afford all the best equipment with your engineering salary.  \nI think there's yet another path. I think electrical engineering can be a stepping stone. Perhaps you enter the audio engineering field after you graduate, and mix your hobby with your passion. Or you can spend a few years in electrical engineering and switch into a music career after a few years to take your shot. Either way, you will luckily be more employable with your engineering degree as opposed to a music degree should you decide to stop pursuing music.",

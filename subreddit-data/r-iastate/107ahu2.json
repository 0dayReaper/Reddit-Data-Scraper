Mostly it\u2019s weekly zybooks and eight labs, four main projects that you\u2019ll have under two weeks to do and then three increasingly difficult exams. Go to lectures if you actually plan on learning otherwise don\u2019t go. Kautz provided a tentative schedule and Java examples that he discusses in class.",

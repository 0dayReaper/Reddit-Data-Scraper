If you haven't donated before, the process is quite simple and usually fairly quick (plus you get free food and find out your blood type). General eligibility requirements for donating blood can be found [here](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility).\n\nEdit: Thanks for the Reddit Gold on the post stranger!",

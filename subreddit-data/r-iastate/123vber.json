I was just wondering if anyone has lived at the social west, what is it like?\n\nIs Management good? Are the CyRides going out there reliable? Is it easy to socialize if you try? etc.",

You are living off campus, so little to minimal socialization will be happening within the apartments to be honest with you. \n\nKind of over priced since you're paying for a furnished apartment. It's not really worth imo getting furnished apartments in ames. There are plenty of nice furniture to be had for cheap if you source it correctly. The furnished stuff is usually just complete crap.",

Management was good when I lived there. \n\nUnfortunately, unless you have a pretty tight knit group willing to make the trip out there, you\u2019re most likely going to have to bus to campus to socialize. However, my roommates and I bussed to campus all the time on the red route and took midnight express back and it was not too big of a deal. I will say, the pool scene in the summer is pretty poppin on a nice day so that was fun.\n\nWhen I lived there I believe rent was around 1500 for a 4 bedroom unfurnished. We lived at both Steinbeck area and the main building around the pool. Both were nice but preferred being closer to the pool/gym. \n\nAll around I preferred it because it was cheaper, quieter and had good sized units. However, if you value convenience and don\u2019t want to have to commute, may not be for you.",

A pro the guy who said you pay extra for a furnished apt is that you barely have to move anything out. I was graduating so it was nice to graduate and just leave with my clothes and not have to get rid of anything.",

Great if you have pets, used to be cheaper but now that I\u2019m looking elsewhere I\u2019m finding it can be on the more pricey end especially with the furnished unit (but still not terrible.) management is usually good, but my old roommates had some problems with maintenance over breaks. They have a few social events throughout the year mostly centered around alcohol from my experience. Busses run through often.",

I personally met more drug dealers than anyone there so not a good sign. Pricing is reasonable and they have a pool, gym, basketball, and volleyball courts. \n\nIf you are looking to do absolutely whatever you want in your apartment and don\u2019t mind being far from campus it\u2019s a decent spot.",

Management is okay, but maintenance has been a little shit for our unit this past year. It took three (3) months for them to fix a broken washing machine between June and August, and we've had issues with water leaking through our ceiling on and off throughout our time here. It could be that we have a particularly shitty unit, but it's something to keep in mind.",

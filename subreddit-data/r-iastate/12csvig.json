My roommates each provide a couple services:\n\nMe: Amazon prime tv, fox sports\nRoomate 2: Hulu, Apple TV \nRoomate 3: Netflix, Disney plus, ESPN+\n\nWe all leave it logged in to the tv.\n\nHowever, my roommates DO NOT know my passwords nor do I know theirs. I also have payment notifications on so if they purchase something through my account I will know. You should not share your accounts through personal devices like laptops and smartphones.",

It was signed in on the person who brought its accounts and they said they were cool with anyone using it if I remember correctly though.\n\nI'll be honest, I don't know anyone who watches streaming services on anything other than their phones or computers.",

And, of course, with a shared TV, people aren't going to bother signing in and out of accounts so a TV will most likely need a shared account. Whether people share accounts with their roommates for other devices is probably very dependent on their relationship with their roommates.\n\nIn my opinion, for things like Netflix, there's very little harm to throwing in a \"guest\" profile or something to share with people.",

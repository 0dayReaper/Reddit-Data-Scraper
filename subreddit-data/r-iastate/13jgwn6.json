Yes less people but the ones you met on campus were always happy and friendly (not saying that isn't the case the rest of the year). Feels like you get the entire place to yourself, sit anywhere you want without being over crowded.   \n\n\nCourse that is more my personality of enjoying a few people over a whole lot of people.",

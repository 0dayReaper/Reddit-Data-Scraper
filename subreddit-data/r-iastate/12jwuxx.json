I just made sure to go to every career fair every semester and talk to people evem if I was not super interested in their company. I would assume with a 3.0 and two internships it would be even easier regardless of the field of engineering.",

Dude had an amazing MechE career: designing bulldozers at caterpillar, group lead, design chief of a new product, eventually principal engineer for an entire product line.\n\nThe punch line: dude graduated with what was then the lowest GPA to ever get an ISU diploma 2.003\n\nYour GPA sets the pecking order for your first job out. Any degree can land you a job that you use to launch yourself to where ever you want to go.",

Once you're a year or two into the workforce, it will no longer be relevant at all. \n\nDepending what field you're going into your mileage will vary.\n\nPro tip, if it takes you a little longer after graduation, don't stop. You can have the internships and put in the work, but especially out of school there's a pinch of luck everyone needs. Your direct competition almost all look the exact same on paper.",

While a lot of people say to aim for a 3.5, you don\u2019t need that to get a job. Especially in your case with internships on your resume, you will be fine when you graduate. Also, after your first full time job, you can remove it because no employer will care anymore since you have full time experience(Atleast in my experience)",

I ended up finding my passion in CyberSecurity and graduated my MS with a 3.98.\n\nWhile jobs in the past asked for my GPA, I found that the best jobs come from those who don\u2019t ask it. When employers belittle your intelligence to an arbitrary number on a 4 point scale, you are shooting yourself in the foot by working for them. \n\nYou can do this. I promise you it will be okay. \nIf you\u2019re an anxious test taker (I was too), reach out to student disabilities office. Even if you do not have a formal diagnosis they still have resources to help you!\n\nWhile I know it\u2019s hard, don\u2019t focus on what others are doing and their path. You have your own timeline and that is the point. You are YOU. \n\nThe fact that you exist is a 1 in 400 trillion possibility. \nI think that makes you pretty awesome! \n\nTake a breath, believe in yourself, and I promise it will all be okay in the end.",

Make them want to hire you. Make sure linkedin and resume is stacked. Projects, if you want to go the extra mile, not necessary since you have 2 internships. However I believe everyone should have projects.. like show me what you worked on the last four years? Ya know. Make sure you know STAR method for interviews. Have your experience listed with tangeable metrics and how you acheived them. The more prepared you are, the more prepared you feel, which will allow you to be relaxed during a potential interview. Don't forget a timely, but not urgent, thank-you follow up email post interview.\n\nGood luck!",

I applied for a job that \u201crequired\u201d 3.5 minimum, and still got in. I know a few friends that graduated with even less, like 2.4-ish and secured well-paying jobs they like! Most employers don\u2019t seem to focus on that number anymore; they hone in on problem solvers and innovators, not bookworms or memorizers. \n\nGood luck OP, you got this! :D",

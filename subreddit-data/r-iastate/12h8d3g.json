    "postText": "Senior in HS that is pretty much decided to come to Iowa state, and I\u2019m trying to decide between Electrical and Mechanical engineering (Aerospace is a fun yet real \u201cwhat if\u201d). Because of this, and the fact I really haven\u2019t learned much details about the programs, I\u2019d really love to hear what you\u2019re working on and what you\u2019re doing and learning in your classes. Any input, from what classes you\u2019re taking to what project you\u2019re working on this week, would be greatly appreciated to help me decide. Thanks!\n\nEdit: If anyone entered as an Undeclared Engineering Major freshman year, what did you think of that engineering 101 class that explored all the different disciplines? I\u2019m kinda nervous that that\u2019d be a waste of time, as I\u2019m really only interested in these 3 disciplines, and frankly the others bore me quite a bit.",

            "comment": "Mech E here. \n\nHonestly I have had a lot of fun. Almost all of your classes are going to be very heavy in math. Personally my \"fun classes\" are thermo, mechanics of materials, and circuits and motors this semester. They are challenging but like I said quite fun. \n\nA quick rundown of what we are doing currently...\n\nThermo: analysis of different systems from turbines, compressors, diffusers, and nozzles and calculating work, temperatures at the input and output, efficiency of these systems. Next chapter is on power plant stuff so that should be cool. \n\nMechanics of materials: This class is basiclly \"if I put this load on a material or object what happens?\" Currently we are looking at where stress will be largest in an object (beams, pressure vessels, etc.) \n\nCircuits and motors: Honestly I don't know how the EE majors do it. This stuff is hard. Once you do a bunch of problems though it starts to make sense. Motors is definitely much more enjoyable and interesting. Right now we are looking at generators and steper motors. \n\nThe engineering 101 class was required for me and like most required classes... A complete waste of time. Just go and get through it. It did briefly talk about the other engineering majors however do not expect to get any in depth description or information about them. For that you will need to talk to one of the advisors or better yet someone in the program. \n\nLmk if you are curious about anything else",

            "comment": "This past week or two in junior year aerospace classes have been roughly like this:\n\n* AerE 331 forgot-the-name-but-basically-Controls-2: Learned how to sketch two useful graphs (rlocus and Bode) that show information about control systems (still don't conceptually understand it because it takes place in the s domain and that is still kind of magic for me). Previously we would plug this into Matlab but doing it by hand has helped my understanding a little bit.\n* AerE 362 also-forgot-the-name-but-its-about-optimization: Learned a few more methods used to optimize functions/designs, in particular quadratic penalties (instead of directly cutting off a constraint, it severely penalizes it without introducing discontinuities and makes the math nicer). Also did some basic stuff with Matlab's built in neural network functions two weeks back.\n* AerE 361, aka programming is pain: Translated my C code from a few weeks ago into Python code. Tasks included writing to and reading from a file, a hangman game, creating various very specific functions, and coming 2 inches away from murdering whoever programmed the autograder.\n* AerE 361 group project portion: Fought with the Arduino IDE to get it to recognize the microcontroller, and instead of making the game I got distracted and started making a piano instead.\n* AerE 311 Aerodynamics II: Electric Boogaloo: Stuff with converging-diverging nozzles (rocket engines lite). 2-3 weeks ago the principle that makes it work finally clicked for me on a molecular level and I love those moments where everything suddenly makes sense!\n* AerE Propulsion Laboratory: Got to watch a supersonic wind tunnel do its thing through a converging-diverging nozzle. Unfortunately it looks less cool than it sounds, but it is the fastest thing I've ever been within a few feet of!\n* Make To Innovate: Began using GNU radio to attempt to decode signals from our under-construction microsatellite after all other methods failed. Learned about software defined radio, and accidentally got the ADCS (the thing that points the satellite) working again by staring at it aggressively.",

            "comment": "MechE:\n\nME 421: System Dynamics and Controls:\nBasically a ton of putting circuits, servomotors, heat transfer, fluid dynamics, and dynamics problems into the Laplace domain. Lots of determining how to connect courses we\u2019ve taken both to each other and to transfer functions, which we can use to prove stability for systems. MEs focus a lot more on getting the system representations correct, AeroE and EE take similar classes but focus more on PIDs and implementing controls, but also don\u2019t go as far in-depth into the system dynamics realm of control theory. \n\nME 370 - Instrumentation: Weird combo of circuits, signal frequency, a little mechanics, first-order, Fourier series, analysis of those topics.\n\nME 373X - Science and Practice of Brewing:\nA really cool, unique, interesting course about everything about the science behind brewing beer. Taught by 3 knowledgeable, experienced, dedicated professors, in the nations biggest and best university beer lab. Mostly biology and chemistry, not a lot of mechanical engineering.\n\nME 415 - Capstone:\nThis is a senior level design course, basically a company comes to ISU with a problem they want engineering students to solve. You\u2019re given a group of students and a budget, and the semester to solve it. Because ISU doesn\u2019t get to pick the projects, the difficulty can vary a lot. Some other groups in my class are solving some extremely difficult, theoretical problems that even a group of experienced, full-time engineers wouldn\u2019t be able to do. Some other groups might get less difficult ones.\n\nEDIT:\nI came is as undecided engineering. The 101 class was pretty helpful at that point, but admittedly Mechanical Engineering is very different than how someone can describe it to you as a freshman when you are only taking math and physics classes and haven\u2019t touched any true engineering. Every class is basically just differential equations (\u2026not fun) and calculus (kinda fun) applied to some niche field of physics. A lot of my friends are AerE, and the two majors are nearly identical for over half of the degree. AerE focuses more on fluids in the last few semesters and, well, airplanes, whereas MechE focuses more electrical stuff (circuits, motors/generators, instrumentation)  and thermo stuff (thermodynamics, heat transfer, etc.)",

            "comment": "AER E here,\n\nAER E 462: The second half of the senior project. The teams in my class have to design and build a prototype drone with the ability to drop a payload. Last semester was the design phase, and in late February/early March we started building the aircraft. Our flight readiness review is this week and (weather allowing) we begin test flights this week or next week. I had previously taken Make to Innovate so it felt a lot like doing that again, though my project was also working with aircraft. \n\nAER E 411: Propulsion, basically Aerodynamics III. Focuses a lot more on aircraft engines. Right now we're going over using stoichiometry for fuel and also turbine efficiency. The course has been a bit rough (especially the recent exam), but not awful.\n\nAER E 452/I E 452: Systems Engineering and Analysis. Probably the most chill class I've been in. No exams, only a couple of case studies and assignments. Right now we've been going over lean six sigma which is commonly used in businesses and optimizing systems.\n\nASTRO 346: Astrophysics, which counts as a technical elective for Aerospace and M E (also taking it to finish out my Astronomy minor). Focuses on the physics of stars, stellar atmosphere, birth, evolution, and death of stars, supernovae, black holes, etc. The professor is very chill despite the intimidating course material, though you definitely need a decent grasp of physics. Side note, ASTRO 344L is another technical elective option for AER E, M E, and E E. It's an interesting, relatively chill class where you get to use a telescope to get imaging of stars, galaxies, and other stellar objects. You get to even do a project of your own choosing, as long as it's doable with the telescopes. If you're interested in space and want to play with a telescope for credit, I highly recommend it.",

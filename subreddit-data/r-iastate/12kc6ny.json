    "postText": "Hi, so it\u2019s looking like I\u2019ll have to take ME 345 (Dynamics), ABE 378/L (Fluids), EM 324 (mechanics of materials), CE 306, and an SSH elective next semester. I\u2019m a civil engineer and have a co-op this semester, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m taking 324 and 378 a semester late.\n\nI passed statics with a C-, but I do feel that I understood the concepts.\n\nIs this biting off more than I can chew? Has anyone done something similar to this?",

My 5th I took CE 206, STAT 305, CE 355, EM 327, CE 332, and ME 345.\n\nDynamics isn't a prerequisite for any class, so there's no worry of pushing it back a bit. Other classes that could work with it would be CE 306, or even something like CE 326 or CE 372. I took it when I did, as I knew other people were taking it at the same time, and wanted to be able to get help from them and talk about it and study together. My catalog year flowchart has it on 5th semester, but I sat next to someone doing it during their 7th semester.\n\nYour advisor can also definitely help.",

Now if you\u2019re taking them together\u2026.you most likely will not have a life outside of school for that semester. Its tough balancing those 2 classes but aerospace students sometimes do it to fit in the classes they need",

I took EM 324 over the summer and actually tutor it now and I couldn't imagine taking them both at the same time and most people I tutor who sign up for both end up dropping one or both of them. Is it doable? Probably, but it's really tough",

That mat be a slight overexaggeration, but it's what I remember. \n\nI typically watched lecture, did notes, and did the homework typically from 6-10ish in the morning. Some days it was really easy and only took an hourish some days it took more. \n\nThen I just went to work until about 6, had actual lecture at 7, and finished the homework if there was any. It's lecture every day M-F, you typically have a homework due every day, and an exam every other Friday.",

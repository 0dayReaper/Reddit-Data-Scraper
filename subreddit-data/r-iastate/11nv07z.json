I took Calc 1 through 3 at DMACC and Differential Equations at ISU. Guess which classes I actually remember. \n\nAt DMACC, not only did I actually learned the info, but kind of enjoyed learning it. The professors make an attempt to help the students learn in class and answer questions instead of requiring you find extra time in your week to attend office hours or SI.\n\nIf anyone wants a recommendation: Nancy Woods at the Boone DMACC is easily the best professor I have ever had. She teaches Physics and Calculus and teaches them well.",

    "postText": "What do you guys think my chances of getting a single dorm are if I just now submitted my housing requests? I\u2019ll be a freshman this fall. I would REALLY prefer a single dorm as I am extremely introverted and would like privacy and a quiet place to do work. I put Friley as my first preference but I\u2019d also like to hear all of your thoughts on the other halls. I\u2019ll be studying Computer Science, so I\u2019d prefer if the hall is close to those classes",

            "comment": "Most freshmen REALLY want their own room too, because like you, they had their own at home.\n\nLiving with roommate is a really great way to grow as a person and become a better human overall. You can still have privacy with a roommate, you just gotta.. communicate with them.\n\nMost people that are introverted can successfully have roommates, but you describe yourself as \"extremely introverted\". How extreme are we talking, are you antisocial? Could your extreme introvertness be a symptom of a mental illness?\n\nIf that's the case, then I think you can get put on a priority list for single room for mental health reasons, as long as you have a doctor backing you up with a tangible diagnosis. I'm guessing ISU would be happy to accommodate you in order to avoid major roommate issues, as long as you're willing to pay single room prices.. lol\n\nIf this isn't the case, then it is okay to be introverted! Just don't let it be a self fulfilling prophecy before you even start college. Don't psych yourself out of having a roommate if you're nervous, it's not that bad. Everyone you know was a stranger at one point.",

I get anxious around people and will go out of my way to avoid social interaction if possible. \n\nThank you for this though. I think I\u2019ll leave some single dorms as my top preferences, but it won\u2019t be the end of the world for me if I do get into a double. I think I can turn college into a fresh start for me and try to push myself to get better with people (for reference, I haven\u2019t had any genuine friends since around elementary school\u2026 so that\u2019s an issue).",

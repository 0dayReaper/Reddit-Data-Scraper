I was looking at Iowa State\u2019s website and I have auto admit for the college but I was wondering if this also includes auto admit into the major I want (computer science). And if not what does the acceptance rate look like for comp sci.",

However, selecting a major does not lock you into a program, it merely helps to assign you an academic adviser and customize information for orientation.\n\nYour HS guidance counselor should be able to help you with your questions.",

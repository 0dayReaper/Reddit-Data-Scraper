Around here, though,  it almost seemed as if no one knew or cared about what happened. The people I\u2019ve heard acknowledging it seemed to be mad that they were still hearing about it two days after it happened. \n\nI do realize that this happened a few states away. And I know my situation is unique, being so close to it. But I kinda expected everyone to be a little more concerned. That could\u2019ve been us. It still could be us. Don\u2019t we think this has gone on too long?",

And when you can do absolutely nothing about that in this country or state, it is psychologically distressing to keep bringing it up and talking about. Yes it has gone on too long, but there is realistically nothing that will be done to change it.\n\nThe 2nd goes along with the first- you can only care about so many things before you just become dead inside. With mass shootings happening regularly, it becomes harder and harder to invest emotions in them. People are essentially numb at this point.",

I think /u/green_platypus and /u/alienatedframe2 are both correct.  When so many horrible things are happening constantly, and have been for so long (with social media algorithms ensuring that they're constantly injected into our visual cortices), I'm not surprised to see numbness and compassion fatigue around any given incident.  Holding things like this at arm's length to avoid examining them too closely can be an defense mechanism, too.\n\nHaving said that, those are not universal responses, and your own feelings on this matter are valid, reasonable, and justified.  With your personal connection to the affected community, it would be weird if you *weren't* engaged.  I'm glad everyone in your circle is okay.\n\nFor my part, I hate that we're here again.  I hate that in a year or two, I'm going to have a stack of literature on this to add to the stack of literature on Virginia Tech.  I hate that I and my colleagues at every other university are going to be sifting through those documents, searching for ways to enhance our own playbooks for something like this happening at our schools.\n\n(And for what it's worth, I think MSU has done a phenomenal job of communication throughout the week, and /r/MSU has been an amazing resource and source of support for its campus community.)",

Absolutely not.\n\nI think it would be really weird if people were actually upset about hearing it, because I\u2019ve literally never heard anyone react to these events that way in my life, so I find it hard to believe multiple people in a few days span at ISU all did. If this is the case, the people you surround yourself with are assholes. I\u2019m honestly guessing your proximity and sensitivity to the situation could have made you interpret a normal response as negative.\n\nAs for students thinking this has gone on long enough, obviously we do. However, this problem affects everybody. I worry about my sister going to work. I worry about my niece going to a mall. I worry about my parents at a restaurant. We all think it\u2019s gone on too long, but there isn\u2019t much we can do about it right now. And as college students, I\u2019m sure you understand that students face many stressors that take priority over the ever-growing amount of shootings in this country.",

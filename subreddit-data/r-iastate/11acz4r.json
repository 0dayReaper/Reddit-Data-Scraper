            "comment": "I was in a fraternity when I was at ISU around 10 years ago. Fraternities are desperate for enrollment to keep their numbers up so you basically get to pick which you want to join. I'm not sure if wet frats even exist anymore but honestly I'd avoid wet and look for a dry house. It's easy to drink in college, but if you can at least keep it out of your house you'll have more success. If you're outgoing and want to be a part of every activity then go for it. I found the constant never ending \"mandatory\" activities to be exhausting. I wish I would have spent more time getting involved in on-campus groups but the frat had non stop commitments that you were expected to be a part of. I came out of it with a couple good friends I wouldn't trade for the world, but overall it wasn't the best experience for me.\n\nAlso you should know that they really sell the greek system as resume building, networking etc but in the real world it doesn't mean a fucking thing having greek letters next to your name, and in some cases it can have a negative context. And then they hit you up non fucking stop for money after you graduate.",

Unless you're into that. If they talk trash about another house to get you to join (that's dirty rushing), stay away from them. Unless you're into that. Ask about hazing, and of course, they'll say no, but try to sus out the 'wiggle' in their answer. Ask about dues and housing commitments.",

            "comment": "Iowa State is in the Big12 not the SEC. This is important to remember when you\u2019re looking at the Greek System as a whole here.\n\nAs it is now almost March \u2014 most of the fraternities are not recruiting for the current semester. Many fraternities will do most of their recruiting over the summer before freshmen even step foot on campus. I would recommend finding the contact of a chapter\u2019s recruitment chair and setting up a meeting. \n\nMost Important: Be aware of what you want to get out of the experience when you start going thru the rush (recruitment) process. Each house has different strengths and weaknesses. \n\nThe Greek System is an excellent way to make friends and make connections with people. Just be conscious of if you want these connections to be solely drinking buddies, or if you want them to also be academic peers and supporters of your values.",

Homework problems were much harder than any exam but you got unlimited guesses so you could guess and check every problem. I didn\u2019t take physics 1 here but heard it was way worse than physics 2. If you are doing fine with Physics 1 then you should be fine with physics 2.",

Physics 2 is more difficult content-wise, but it was much easier exam-wise. They have to switch the class coordinator to make it much more manageable. Save your money and take it here. It's a past misconception that it's much harder. I spoke with the professor when I took it, and this comes from 2016 when they had a very rude and difficult professor teach the course.

I think a lot of the complaints levied against it are moreso problems shared by both physics 1 and 2, but they're problems nonetheless.\n\n\nProblems on the HW, at least in my experience, are way harder than the problems on quizzes and exams. For whatever reason, physics has two kinds of quizzes (the in-person ones you take at recitation, and weekly online \"checkpoints\"). Lectures can very much go either way, but if you have certain profs, all they're going to be is a research prof saying equations at you and expecting you to absorb them. If you haven't taken calc 3 or diff eq, certain units may be harder than others. \n\n\nOverall, I don't necessarily regret taking it here (although I still have to take the final, so that could change) - my grade isn't stellar, but I'm not at risk of failing the class (again, final pending). If you can afford to take it somewhere else, I don't think it's a bad idea, but if you don't struggle with electricity and magnetism and you're good at reading equation sheets, you'll probably come out well enough that you don't need to retake it",

    "postText": "I want to 3D print some parts I made in Solidworks for my Senior Design Project. I want to use the \"Ultimaker\" printers (the white boxes) found on the 2nd floor of the SIC.\n\nWhat file types should my 3D models be if I want to print them? I've tried .stl and .obj files and the printer couldn't find them on my Flash Drive. Am I missing a step?\n\nThank you for the help.",

I would also walk in and talk to the person in there. They will get you set up with training for the printers there",

From there you can slice the model into the gcode the printer will need to print the file. You would also input your temp settings and other stuff at that point depending on how \"pretty\" you want your print to be.\n\nEdit: I went and traced the export steps... \n\nIn SOLIDWORKS with your part open go to:\n1.  file \n2. print3d \n3. Then click on the model\n4. Go to the bottom where it says save to file and open the drop-down\n5. Select stl\n\n6.save the file to your computer using the save file button\n\nYou would then need to place this file in a slicing software to create the gcode needed to print. Then you give that file to the printer to actually print the item.",

    "postText": "Hey,\n\nI'm (m/24) excited to spend my semester abroad at Iowa State University, and I'm currently in search of the best housing option. I'd love to hear your opinions and experiences on whether I should go for the dorms/halls or an apartment like Frederiksen Court.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: \nI will be staying at ISU for the fall 2023 semester, majoring in Computer Science, and I have been assigned to Frederiksen Court. However, I am now considering changing my housing to Friley/Helser Dorm because I'm concerned that Frederiksen Court may not offer enough social opportunities, given that there are only four people in each apartment. Can someone help me and provide their opinion on whether Frederiksen Court can be a social place to live, or if it's worth it to switch? Considering that I am a bit shy/introverted, and I really want to meet as many people as possible and make a lot of friends, what would be the most social option for me, considering I will only be there for the fall semester?",

            "comment": "Given your age, freddy court makes more sense as your roommates &amp; people in that area are typically older. Dorms are full of freshmen &amp; are louder than apartments (usually). I think you\u2019ll be fine if you lived in freddy &amp; made it a point to put yourself out there! Say hi to people in classes, spend time on campus instead of your room, &amp; join a few clubs at club fest. Having multiple roommates in freddy could also be useful, as you could become friends with them &amp; meet their friends potentially.",

Should I not change? I'm not brining a car and it seems like a hassle to have to take the bus back and forth. Plus I'm a little nervous on taking the bus.",

However remember it\u2019s basically all freshman fresh out of high school so the maturity level a 22 yr old has is not present in most freshman. \n\nThe bus system can be intimidating at first but its very easy to use! It comes in handy in the winter &amp; the bus to freddy court comes every 15mins I believe. I\u2019d recommend taking a friend or roommate on the bus just to ride it around or go to Target before classes start thats what i did as a freshman in 2019. Also download the app mystate &amp; u can see live where the busses are, where the routes go to, &amp; where stops are etc. If you don\u2019t want to use the bus, then having a friend with a car is nice, but you\u2019ll eventually need the bus on the bitter cold days to make it to classes.",

You can walk to lagomarcino and all those buildings near there in like 7 minutes. It took me several minutes longer to walk to that side of campus from the design center on the northwest side of campus than from freddy. Depends a little on where your classes are but you\u2019d be right next to a bus stop and like 5 minutes away from a ton of bus routes that go through campus. I was nervous to take the busses too, but you\u2019ll have to do it at some point and the mystate app makes it super simple to figure out which ones to take to get where you need to. That whole east side of campus is easily within walking distance if you absolutely do not want to take a bus, west side of campus is probably 20-25 minute walk at most, but it doesnt make much sense to walk that far on campus where the busses run pretty much constantly and theres a stop like every few hundred feet.",

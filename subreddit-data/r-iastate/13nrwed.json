He's basically an on-campus deity who guides engineering students (and math majors) through their arduous journey through all levels of calculus with a heartwarming smile.\n\nOkay maybe that was a bit much, but I can't think of a single person who knows of Steve Butler and doesn't like him. The man has a whimsical fascination with math and is so happy to teach it to those who will learn. He genuinely enjoys what he does. Even if you don't get him for any of your classes he has recorded lectures for calc 1-3 and differential equations, which has been a massive help to me personally.\n\nIf you're not good at math, just wait until you meet this man or watch his lectures, cause you'll probably find out, you're not as bad as you thought.",

It was a spectacular storm, being able to capture the lights over ISUs brightly lit campus was jaw dropping. Even w my bare eye I could see pillars and the sky rippling with white light. \n\nThe view from my apartment has been incredible this year and allowed me to take some very nice photos. I will miss it dearly like I will miss everything about ISU.",

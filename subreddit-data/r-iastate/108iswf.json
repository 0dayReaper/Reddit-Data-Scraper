    "postText": "When is there an intermission after five matches at a college wrestling dual? \n\nI\u2019ve been to two Iowa State Cyclones duals. The dual I went to during the 2019-20 season had a 10 or 15 break in the middle. There was no intermission when I went this last weekend. (We therefore didn\u2019t get Clone Cones.)\n\nWas an intermission tried and then rejected? Is it only some duals (Big 12) that have the intermission?\n\nI posted this question in r/wrestling and the best answer was that it\u2019s up to the host. The Big 10 duals have intermissions. \n\nWhen does ISU wrestling have an intermission?",

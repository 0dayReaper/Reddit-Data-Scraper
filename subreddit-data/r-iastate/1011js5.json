            "comment": "took this class just this fall. Note that I have had a web dev internship and knew basic HTML, CSS, and JS very well before coming in.\n\nDidn't go to lecture past first week. Weekly 'lab' which is really just a quiz takes about 5 minutes a week from your room and all answers are in the lab instructions. 4 homework assignments took about 2-3 hours on average. Final project in last 3 weeks is where things ramped up. Me and my partner procrastinated it but we knocked it out in a weekend. I thought our project kinda sucked and was very simple but we made it to top 5 projects in class. I finished the class with over a 100%.\n\nIf you have a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS / have had an internship and/or taken 309, this class should be a total breeze.\n\nEven if you are a complete noobie, this will probably be one of the easiest courses in the curriculum.",

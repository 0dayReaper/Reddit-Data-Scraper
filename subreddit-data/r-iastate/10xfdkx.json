    "postText": "Taking dynamics this semester and it\u2019s a real shit show. Professor has constantly cancelled class that\u2019s led us to fall behind and then we\u2019re expected to finish 8 HW assignments on things we barely learned about because they decided to rush through each topic. There\u2019s an exam this Monday and if it weren\u2019t for the little bit of physics knowledge I wouldn\u2019t even know what I\u2019m doing. Really annoying as this is the only class this semester that is giving me a hard time because it feels like they don\u2019t know how to teach. - rant over",

I signed up to rush, but after receiving financial information about how much it costs to be in a sorority at isu, my parents said I can\u2019t.\n\nare a large number of students involved in greek life here? I\u2019m worried that I will feel left out not being apart of it.",

Even then, is such a small deal that I personally didn't even know that homecoming happened until a few days after this year lmao. It's definitely not something I'd worry about.\n\nHonestly, I might even lean towards recommending avoiding bothering with Greek life depending on who I'm talking to.",

And in my experience, Old RCA tends to beat the Greeks at KQ.  The rest of the year the only way you'd know we have Greeks at all is by reading the police log (stay classy Farmhouse).",

I was in a sorority, do not feel worried at all about not feeling apart of social life on campus because you aren\u2019t in greek life. \nthere are some scholarship opportunities that can help cover some of the cost, if it\u2019s something you really are interested in it\u2019s worth just shooting a dm to the panhellenic penny insta account asking about it. Another thing you could look into is the multicultural greek council, their chapters are a lot smaller so the experience is different but if it\u2019s tradition and network that you are looking for that could be an option and their dues are a bit lower.  \n\nas someone who wafered a bit on their membership there are certainly pros and cons to greeklife but it is not at all needed to have a whole social experience at isu. if you want to rush there\u2019s no harm in that and using it as a way to meet people and then from there deciding if the experience is worth the money. \n\nas others mentioned clubs are a great way to get involved on campus, there are plenty that even have a ton of members living together in houses and throw parties and stuff if that is what you are looking for. another thing to keep in mind is that you\u2019re going to meet friends in the wildest of places in college, i met my closest friend in tutoring. Sororities make socializing convenient but they to not guarantee a close knit friend group. figure out what it is out of a sorority and see if you can fulfill that elsewhere, for me it was meeting girl friends outside of my major (it\u2019s 12% girls so i knew this would be difficult) and taking classes outside of my major and having roommates with different majors def helped with that for me. \n\nkeep in mind, everyone coming into college is in the same situation as you and less than 20% of the girls coming in with you will be rushing. hope this was helpful :)",

Although I did not join a sorority simply because I thought the time commitment and not being able to cook in my own kitchen just wasn\u2019t for me. It is dwindling down from years prior for rush and many houses are struggling with that. I love my sorority friends and there is a week or two a year I wish I was in a sorority . The other hand of that is that there are MANY weeks I am grateful I am not. The time commitment, the cliques that are formed (I\u2019m friends with at least one girl in each sorority and they are all eerily similar with drama), the rules you have to follow on going out, it really sort of molds you to be friends with only people in Greek life which sort of sucks. Point of this is, go through rush, meet friends, after rush you\u2019ll still b friends with those girls and get the benefits of sorority life with 0 cost.",

I\u2019d say just a rough estimate like 40 out of the 375 people I\u2019ve come to know on campus are in greek life. There is so much for you to do. There are organizations for anything and events that cover a wide range of interests. It can be scary coming into school not knowing anyone, but as someone who was Not Welcomed as much by students when I first got here for\u2026various reasons I promise you will find your crowd whether that\u2019s in a sorority or not.",

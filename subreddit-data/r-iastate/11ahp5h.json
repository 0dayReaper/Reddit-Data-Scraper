    "postText": "I have a question about transferring majors within the engineering school. Let\u2019s say that after my freshman year I wanted to switch my major to a different engineering discipline. Would whatever corresponding engineering class I took that semester transfer to the new disciplines corresponding class? For example would Aero 161 cover Mech 170? Or would I have to take mech 170 the next semester?",

            "comment": "Your first-semester courses would almost certainly transfer fine, but most classes outside of the engineering basic program, in your case AerE 161 and ME 170, generally won't. I recommend setting up a meeting with your academic advisor to discuss the possibility of changing majors and see what they know about transferring credit for that class.\n\nRegardless, even if the classes don't transfer, I wouldn't pay too much attention to that because, in the whole scheme of things, taking one extra class would almost certainly be worth it to have a career in a discipline that you prefer.",

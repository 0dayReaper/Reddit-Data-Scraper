If you're planning to eventually get the car plated and use it around town, they have recorded the VIN in their records even though it may not show up on your ticket.  Then if you try to get a university parking permit or whatever with that car, you'll need to provide the VIN, and their very efficient systems will match this ticket to you.\n\nIf you were only visiting town, you should be fine.\n\nEDIT - this is dated info; I'm an alumnus who hasn't been on campus in many years.  ISU police may have gotten lazy in the interim, but why chance it if the ticket is cheap....",

It is $5 per session, but there are other funding sources available if you need them (like the ISSO, WISE, etc.).\n\nEcon 102 is easier than 101 if you are needing an econ course. The alternatives will depend on what requirement this class is fulfilling for your major. Reach out to your academic advisor and they should be able to help! :)",

Make sure to get perfect scores on the homework and top hat questions (which shouldn\u2019t be too hard.) study the slides for the tests. Tests are all multiple choice with lots of questions directly from top hat. At the end of the class there was a chance to increase you grade by 4% from one simple extra credit assignment. Overall class should be an easy A.",

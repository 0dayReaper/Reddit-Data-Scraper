I can now apply to engineering scholarships, but I know that software engineering has a sort of deal with the liberal arts building. Would I lose this money because it's specific to liberal arts?",

If you switch from LAS college to Engineering college, you likely will lose any LAS specific scholarships. This is not always the case, but I know people who wouldn\u2019t change their major to a different college because of this. \n\nOne of my friends is considered LAS (does science stuff don\u2019t remember specific major) and has scholarships, and she wanted to switch to Agriculture and Life Sciences for a specific biology degree, but when she discovered she\u2019d lose some scholarships, she decided against it.",

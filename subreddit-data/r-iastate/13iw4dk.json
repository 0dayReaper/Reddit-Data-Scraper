The owner is incredibly chill and pays better than most places. He also owns all 3 DQ locations in Ames, so it\u2019s quite easy to get more hours and to find shift covers. We could always use more college-aged workers to work at night. I\u2019m not working there this summer, but I work during the school year. That\u2019s my recommendation!",

Every summer I didn't have an internship I kept working at my job as a student IT. The general workload was reduced as fewer students meant fewer things being used meant fewer things breaking. Though there was an uptick in physical work as in rewiring and reimaging the computer labs and taking a ton of cardboard from recently unboxed machines to the recycling dumpster.",

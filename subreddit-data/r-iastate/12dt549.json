    "postText": "So upon registering for classes for the fall 2023 semester, I realized that all of the ASL courses no longer count for diversity credits. This is kind of annoying, as I\u2019d been planning to take ASL 101 for those credits for a while. After all, it\u2019s more diverse to learn how to properly communicate with an infamously overlooked minority group than almost any other class on the diversity course list. Also, ASL classes were some of the only classes on the diversity course list that actually teach a practical skill; I\u2019m paying for a class no matter what, so I might as well get an applicable skill out of it. I\u2019m also aware that I can still take ASL courses, however they\u2019re much harder to prioritize in my schedule when it won\u2019t contribute to my degree.\n\nI know it probably won\u2019t make a difference, but does anyone know where I can file a complaint about this matter? I just feel like erasing incentive for taking ASL courses is the opposite of diverse.\n\nOn a related note, anyone have any recommendations on good diversity courses?\n\nTL,DR: Starting next semester, ASL courses will no longer count towards the U.S. Diversity credits required to graduate. This pisses me off. Where can I complain?",

            "comment": "The focus of the U.S. Diversity requirement is understanding the social complexity of human beings based on analytical categories such as race, ethnicity, or gender, and the ways those categories have excluded historically marginalized groups. Intersectional understandings of diversity consider other categories of identity (e.g. sexuality, culture, and religion) related to race and ethnicity. A diverse and robust education means exploring these social complexities in a structured learning environment to familiarize students with the historical, societal, and political contributions of diverse populations. \n\nThrough completion of the U.S. Diversity requirement, students will achieve at least three of the following learning outcomes:\n\n1. Identify the experiences and contributions of underrepresented or marginalized groups and how they have shaped the history and culture of the United States.\n\n2. Understand the analytical concepts of culture, ethnicity, race, gender, sexuality and/or religion and be able to apply these concepts to an analysis of the United States.\n\n3. Analyze systemic oppression and personal prejudice and their impact on marginalized communities and the broader U.S. society.\n\n4. Evaluate important aspects of diversity, equity, and inclusion so they can live, work, and collaborate with others in the 21st century United States.\n\nThe ASL course does not meet requirements for a diversity class.",

That fulfills criteria #1.\n\nIn a hearing-centric country (and world), Deaf and HoH people continue to fight for equal opportunities to experience life. How many aspects of our lives are focused on speaking, music, and sound in general? The financial burden of having to pay for an interpreter or be disadvantaged daily is something that hearing people don\u2019t have to think about. Criteria #3.\n\nLearning the language of a marginalized people that created a way to connect beyond speech is inherent to communicating, collaborating, and living with said marginalized people. The impact of knowing even a little bit of ASL and having the desire to interact with Deaf and HoH people in a way that respects them can be profound.  #4.\n\nWhile I am a hearing person, I researched Deaf culture for awhile when I was considering med school for audiology. I\u2019ve never taken a language course at ISU, but I doubt they never cover any culture or history of the language that is taught.\n\nIf the ASL courses do not pass the diversity criteria, then the department may find it impactful to have a \u201cDeaf Culture, History, and Future\u201d type course to fit the criteria.\n\n(also, Disability in a Diverse Society, SP ED 210X is listed as U.S. Diversity, which does not focus on a race, ethnicity, or gender group but how disability interacts with all of them, similar to how anyone of any ethnicity can be Deaf \ud83d\ude42)",

The desire to have it classify as diversity requirement class should go to the chair of the respective department.",

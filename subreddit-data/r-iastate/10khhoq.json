Normally with a turbocharged car when you get off the gas the turbo loses boost and when you step on the gas there is a short time before you have boost again (called \u201clag\u201d). An anti-lag tune when you get off the gas keeps the throttle part way open and delays the spark timing.  As a result the \u201cexplosion\u201d that normally occurs in the cylinder occurs in the exhaust\u2014keeping the turbo spinning.  Result: instant boost and power when you get back on the throttle.  It\u2019s originally a rally car thing, but some people put on their street car.  It\u2019s hard on the engine though so maybe he won\u2019t be doing it all that long ;)",

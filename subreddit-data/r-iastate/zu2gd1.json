Is it possible for those to be waived or is there something else I should plan on? I\u2019m meeting with my advisor before classes start but want to mentally prepare myself for what I need to do",

            "comment": "It sounds like you need to completely reevaluate how you go about studying/ doing school work. 1.9 is extremely low. But if your gpa gets too low then you will be put on academic probation and if you don\u2019t improve you will get kicked from the school. I don\u2019t know how it is different since this is not your cumulative gpa, but that\u2019s what happens with the cumulative",

However, I would like to agree with u/Maroczy-Bind in regards to your method of doing coursework as it is clearly not effective. There are several academic resources that can help you get on track that I have linked below :\n\n1. asc.dso.iastate.edu/resources                      - different templates to get organized.\n2. aso.dso.iastate.edu/academic-coaching    - an academic coach that will help you cover your weaker points and help you organize yourself.\n\nThere are also SIs\u2019 and tuition options for classes you might be facing difficulties with that I suggest you visit when required. Otherwise, have all your classes in person and attend all of them! If you don\u2019t feel like going to one, the fear of academic dismissal is a good motivator!\n\nI\u2019ve been where you are (very recently), so trust me when I say, you can do this!",

And I'll definitely acknowledge Iowa State is known for those kinds of programs, and I commend them for that... Compared to the University of Iowa and their slurry of useless liberal arts programs they claim to be known for. \n\nHaving said that, institutionally, the system is broken. Even if college worked for you, defending the system we have is out of touch. \n\nIf you can figure your shit out before you go, and know what you want to do,  what the reward will be, and have an idea of the challenges, great. \n\nThis is just not the case for so many people, who enter college at 18 or 19... and it's an expensive  thing to learn the hard way. \n\nI didn't go to dmacc. I have a high school diploma and a better job than a lot of my friends with bachelor degrees. Most of these people just ended up in college after high school because it was an expectation.",

I did it by getting a AAA membership ($50 annually) which allows you to rent from Hertz without the minor driver fee (which is way more than $50) provided you are at least 20. I believe you can rent from Hertz at 18 regardless, but it\u2019ll cost you a lot.\n\nAs a bonus, I locked my keys in my car the week after I got back from spring break, called AAA, and got a locksmith out to me for free.

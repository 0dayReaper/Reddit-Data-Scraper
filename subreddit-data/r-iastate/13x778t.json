If you are promoted&lt;1&gt; you jump one (or two sometimes) levels  (eg 807 to 808 or 809).  There is a min 5% raise when promoted, but you must make at least min in your new level. The ranges generally shift up annually with inflation and occasionally with a market review \u2014 this is another way the minimum can be triggered.  If you reach max, then the only raise you can get is however much the max moves up due to the previously mentioned range updates.\n\n&lt;1&gt; eg Analyst I to Analyst II (there is a whole process around this)",

Assuming the state legislature allocates money for it then employees typically will receive a raise on 1-July. Sometimes these raises are flat (2% for everyone), sometimes they are merit based (some get more than others), often it is a mixture.  Midpoint and top third are basically just statistical markers. You may not exceed maximum.",

However, ISU has some really attractive benefits: very comprehensive insurance, 34 days off (24 vacation, 10 holidays) [plus sick leave] starting in year 1, and a 200% retirement match (you put in 5% of your salary and ISU adds another 10%).  Another major plus is largely the absence of the kind of insincere back-stabby office politics you find at some private employers.   Also very little chance that ISU will go out of business ;)",

            "comment": "Pay distributions while you're in that grade. That's pretty typical. If you were hired or promoted you can expect your minimum salary to be more than the min. Every year you get a raise ( or not). If you reach a point too far above mid they will start to consider you for a promotion to the next grade. The distribution is determined by equal or similar job types across the industry you're in. In this case it's probably university pay scales across the mid west. I know nothing about p&amp;s but I bet I'm pretty close. Since the university is public, your salary will be too. You could also reach out to the university HR and ask how grades are determined, but I bet it's a combination of years with the university and job type",

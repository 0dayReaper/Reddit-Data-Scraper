            "comment": "Your posted split looks pretty solid. I am not an expert, but my mother is a certified personal trainer. She has suggested to me in the past that instead of doing certain parts of the body on certain days you shuffle up those workouts so you hit each part of the body multiple times a week. For example, instead of doing three leg exercises on Monday, you do one leg exercise on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. And the same w the other targeted days.",

            "comment": "Try a Push, Pull, Legs split. In my opinion, and a lot of other people, it is the most optimal in terms of hitting each muscle group and being efficient in the gym. For example, on Monday, do chest, triceps, and shoulders (pushing), on Tuesday do back and biceps (pulling), and Wednesday do legs. You can repeat this again and then do a rest day on the 7th day of the week if you are really committed, but ofc you can modify it to suit your needs. As far as what workouts to do, there\u2019s tons of information online and the best way to learn is to just go in and try it. One piece of advice I have tho, don\u2019t listen to social media gym \u201cinfluencers\u201d because they tend to provide incorrect information, too complex information for beginners, and assume you have 3 hours to go to the gym which most people don\u2019t. Keep it simple, lift heavy (with good form), 8-12 reps, slow and controlled with high intensity. \n\nUltimately, it all depends on your goals. It is most beneficial to train a muscle group 2x per week, hence the Push, pull, legs being preferred. As some people have mentioned, a full body split is nice, but imo you need to dedicate more time to each muscle group",

Additionally it\u2019s important to have a goal or purpose for why you\u2019re doing this. If you just want to stay fit then you can continue with this, maybe add some cardio each time you go, and increase weight as necessary. If there is a specific thing you want to do then it would be go to adjust based on that goal.",

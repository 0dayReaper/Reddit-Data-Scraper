    "postText": "I ended up getting a D- in DSN S 131 this semester, and I am worried as I know the bare minimum for a lot of the design majors are a 3.2-3.3 GPA for the design courses within the core year.\n\nThough I\u2019m interested in applying for the art majors primarily, (they are way less selective and have more openings) I am also considering applying to the design majors too as they have more opportunities. (I\u2019m looking into applying for Integrated Studio Arts, Graphic Design, and Industrial Design). \n\nWhat can I do? And what will happen? \nI think overall I\u2019ll have to retake DSN S 131 as I don\u2019t want the failing grade on my transcript, but I am worried since taking two studio courses a semester sounds awful.",

Don\u2019t feel afraid to do so during this winter break too.**\n\nWhen I contacted my advisors, they offered the following options:\n\n- [ ] **Retake the studio course you failed in addition to the new one, but contact your advisor(s) for dropping spring gen ed courses.**\n\nThere\u2019s a wavier that they can pass onto those looking at appliances for entering the COD that they don\u2019t have to take gen eds when in this position. (However, if you failed any previous gen eds this is still applicable to the ones you haven\u2019t taken yet, but you will still be advised to retake the gen eds you failed in addition to the failed studio).\n\n- [ ] **Contact (not just) your studio professors before the spring semester starts to inform them of your situation in regards to taking both studio courses in one semester.**\n\nThey will be accommodating and it will at least give them better consideration and context for your situation! A lot of professors don\u2019t genuinely want to fail their students (ironic based on my initial post lol) and instead offer assistance, so please look into this!\n\n- [ ] **If retaking a studio course, try to get into the same section you were in the previous semester.**\n\nYou may be able to resubmit projects you did beforehand if your professor agrees to it, so it\u2019ll give you more time to work on the other design projects while in class! I specify getting into the same section since each design professor assigns different projects even when teaching the same studio.\n\n- [ ] **Depending on what major you are interested in, you could apply for the COD the following year while taking courses required for the major you\u2019re interested in.**\n\nHowever, remember that a lot of design majors are very restrictive on non design majors taking their courses, so be sure to look at the four/five year plan in advance on what you can do! Contact the advisors in the departments you are interested on applying for beforehand!\n\n- [ ] **Following what is mentioned above, don\u2019t retake the studio course in the spring and do so in an upcoming year if you are able to squeeze it in your schedule and get the newer grade!**\n\nYou may have to take summer courses for gen eds that are necessary after your freshman year to make room, however.",

    "postText": "Due to a late job offer, I have decided to stay in Ames over the summer. I currently live in Freddy Court and want to stay in the same room if possible. I know it is a bit late to be doing all this, but it is what it is.\n\nI log into the housing portal and I see it: Yes! They are still accepting contracts for Summer 2023! So I sign in and go through the big scary \"YOU WILL OWE US HALF OF THE CONTRACT VALUE IF YOU CANCEL AFTER XXX DATE\" part, and then sign it with my ID.\n\nAlmost immediately after I realize I have made a dreadful mistake. I have accidentally signed up for Spring 2023 instead of Summer 2023. I left the department of residence a phone call asking them to help out, they aren't open until tomorrow morning though.\n\nQuestion 1: With 2 weeks left, why is the university even accepting Spring 2023 applications? And why do they let someone sign multiple housing contracts for the same term (I already live on campus)?\n\nQuestion 2: How likely is it that they waive the (potentially quite hefty) cancellation fees when I talk to them tomorrow?\n\nQuestion 3: Is there anything else I should be doing in this situation?",

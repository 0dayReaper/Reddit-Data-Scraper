In today\u2019s day and age, everyone should know how to code at least a little. Especially as a mechanical engineer, the number of computers and software programs that interface with machines is always growing and it\u2019ll help you learn how to adapt to that.",

            "comment": "I did this at the end of my sophomore year.\nPro: you will learn how to code in Java, meaning that you can pick up other languages like C and Python really quickly. It's extremely useful to know how to code in the job market to automate tasks and the like. Another benefit is exposure to a different field and industry. I'm considering doing statistics and data science for my masters degree even tho I have an ME undergrad because I found out I really like those two things.\nCon: it adds a lot of load onto your schedule. For me, 227 wasn't that bad but I took 228 and 230 together which was a lot of work. 311 is a contender for the hardest class I've taken only up there with thermo 2 and heat transfer. It is incredibly hard to wrap your mind around the concepts and such. \n\nOverall, I'd say make sure you're actually interested in advanced topics and not just coding. If you just want to code learn that on your own, but if you want to learn about data structures, algs, and whatever your tech elective is (I took 474-machine learning) then go for the minor. Just make sure you can balance everything.",

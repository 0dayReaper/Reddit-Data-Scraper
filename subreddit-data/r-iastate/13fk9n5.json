    "postText": "Hey everyone! I am an out of state rising senior in highschool from South Carolina. I go to Iowa every summer so I have been to the area. I want to major in Computer Science but I heard the program is competitive at ISU. Is this true? Do you think I would be accepted with a 3.4 gpa and 28ACT and few EC\u2019s? Thanks. Also I would love to hear the highschool stats of other comp Sci students! \n\n(Also if I applied as a different major would it be easy to switch before school starts? English to CS?)",

I'd also recommend taking a look at the Software Engineering major https://catalog.iastate.edu/collegeofengineering/softwareengineering/ . As for the HS stats of other comp sci students, Iowa State does not require you to apply for your major like a lot of other engineering schools, you pick it, and as long as you keep the required GPA, you're in. So, it's kind of irrelevant.",

I had very similar scores you'll be fine, you'll probably get an automatic scholarship even. Utilize office hours!!\n\nAlso saw someone posted SE vs Com Sci, they're very similar programs. You'll have to take diff eq and do a senior project if you do SE, there are a few other differences too. I believe in CS you'll do a couple more computer theory courses\n\nHere are the flowcharts (imo the most helpful thing)\n\nSoftware Engineering:\nhttps://se.iastate.edu/files/2022/10/23-24-Software-Engineering-Flowchart-branded-final.pdf\n\nCom Sci:\nhttps://www.cs.iastate.edu/files/page/files/flowchart_2023-24_catalog_1.pdf",

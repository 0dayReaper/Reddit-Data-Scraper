I remember when I came to Iowa state for a college visit during my senior year of high school, an Iowa State senior came there to introduce us to ISU and what his experience was like. I remember him saying something like \u201c4 years of undergrad seems like a long time but flies by fast\u2026\u201d. I thought what he said was very cliche and cheesy at the time, but it\u2019s true, 4 years is gonna fly by fast and the next thing you know, you\u2019re on the stage with your peers getting your degree. The friends you will make here will be lifelong and they sort of become your second family, especially if you\u2019re coming here out of state like me. Enjoy it :)",

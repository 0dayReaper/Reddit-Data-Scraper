I am too, I\u2019m taking 324 this summer and find this accelerated pace to be a little bit to much at times, but I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m going to pass the class (albeit with maybe not an A). I just want to know if the gaps of confusion in this class are going to make for a super hard lab next semester.",

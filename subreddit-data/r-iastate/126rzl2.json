As someone who helped run it and went as a freshman. \nCus it\u2019s very good to get to know the campus, meet new people, chance for prizes, but also it\u2019s soemthing where if it is not for u it isn\u2019t for you and u can walk away anytime ;) at the very least the first day they give u food and there is a mini club fest. But at the very least the hypnotist is glorious. Every time",

You're placed in a group with other ppl in the same dorm as you, so it's a great way to meet people who live near you and make friends with people who might be outside your major. There's also free food, some items (t shirt I think?), and an opportunity to get to know the campus and speak with your DIS team leader who has already been at ISU for at least one year. \n\nOn the other side, the last day is usually less interesting, imo. Since greek life rush is that week, lots of people will also skip DIS to spend time with the people in their frat/sorority. So if you're planning on joining a frat or sorority, it might be a good idea to spend a day or two at DIS and the rest of your time with your greek community. \n\nPerhaps the best thing to do is go to DIS on the first day and check the vibe. If you like it, you can keep going since it's only a weekend. If you don't like it, there's really no commitment for you to attend the whole thing. Check out the schedule and see what entices you!",

The activities themselves frankly weren't really worth the time, but you meet people in your dorm and even if you don't become best friends it's atleast some friendly faces you'll be comfortable with around the building. \n\nGeneral consensus amongst most students was it was a waste of time which created something to bond over complaining about, ironically creating community.",

My friends who didn't go probably don't know about 50% of campus resources. \n\nI was able to make some really good friends and I would totally recommend it. It starts in the evening in Hilton Coliseum and they bring out speakers so it's kinda boring but everything else is pretty cool.",

That makes them flare, too much can stress them and damage their health. But a betta put him in a 5 gallon tank, no bowl I swear to christ. Then if his lights are on the room lights have to be as well or he could literally die. Then you don't have to remember to turn them off.",

Kindof like when its dark outside and your lights are on, the window becomes barely reflective. Also all bettas are different some care a lot more than others. My betta here cares, but my in my tanks at home some have been completely chill. Currently in my two bettas tanks they both dislike it.",

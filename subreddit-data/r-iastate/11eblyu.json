I wanted to get a US driving license. May I ask if it is possible to replace the European or Jordanian? If it is possible to do so what is the required documents and the procedure. Also, the estimated costs please.\nI tried to find answers to my questions on the Iowa Department of Transportation but could not. Any help is highly appreciated. \n\nThanks in advance.",

In the FAQ there is this:\n\n&gt;I am a student and  I have a valid driver\u2019s license from another state/country. Do I need an Iowa driver\u2019s license?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Iowa Department of Transportation provides an answer to this question [here](http://www.iowadot.gov/mvd/driverslicense/MM935_NewToIowaFAQ.pdf).\n\nFrom that DOT document:\n\n&gt;A student who has a permanent residence and a valid driver\u2019s license in another state or country may operate a motor vehicle on Iowa roadways without obtaining an Iowa driver\u2019s license. A student is required to possess the driver\u2019s license while operating a motor vehicle and may need to have the license translated into English if not already done so",

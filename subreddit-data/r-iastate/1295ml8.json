    "postText": "Hello. I'm an incoming freshman this fall 2023. I paid deposit for the school so I'm up to deciding which dormitory I should apply to. I'm majoring statistics so I think west campus dormitories are ideal. However, since I couldn't find any pictures about bathrooms and shower place on each dormitory, I'd like to ask ISU students who currently live there about how they think about their dormitories. Which dormitory do you guys recommend the most? I'd also get involved in a friendly social community. Thanks for your advice!",

I lived there for two years and am still in daily contact with my friend group three years after college. \n\nHelser has a good community too but no AC was a deal breaker \n\nThe other two, Martin and something are north of Helser and are newer and nicer. They cost more though if that\u2019s a co cern for you",

Besides Friley, do you recommend other dorms too on other sides of the university?? I need to write a list for the contract so.",

I didn\u2019t know many people that lived there but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it \n\nThe Maple Willow Larch complex was cool and right above one of the better dining places. I was in the rooms a couple times - I didn\u2019t like how high everything was. Friley is more spread out \n\nThe new Buchanan and Geoffrey are across Lincoln way and have a more independent feel, but they might not be open to freshman \n\nThe roberts Welch and oak, all those between MWL and the union were.. weird lol. They just kinda seemed removed even though they were between everything, probs oh just kept to themselves\n\nTo break down:\n\nFar west: friley, Helser, Eaton and Martin. Friley is it\u2019s own unit and Helser is it\u2019s younger brother. Eaton and Martin are apart of the group but people are generally richer over there \n\nMiddle: oak elm linden roberts Lyon, etc are sort of an eclectic group of smaller dorms that swear by the dining hall in the basement of oak elm lol (it wasn\u2019t that good)\n\nEast: maple willow larch, great compact dorm towers over a great dining hall. The bud system is amazing at isu and there\u2019s one leaving every ten minutes to take you into campus\n\nCampus town: Geoffrey and Buchanan, new and independent. Don\u2019t know much \n\nTowers: middle of nowhere, good parking",

That said, big single rooms, quiet place to get away from campus, not many people to share the washrooms with, and close parking so I like it. They\u2019re opening the other tower next year too. Definitely not a place to source your friends from though imo.",

The suck I'd what brings people together. But my best bet is the go for a learning community for your major as you'll be put with the same people that's in you classes together.",

Found it helpful that it was right in the middle of east and west campus, and not too far from the MU, as well as being just north of most of the fraternities and sororities. In terms of the dorm itself, it's definitely the nicest dorm but also one of if not the most expensive to live in. It's pretty social, I'm still in touch with a bunch of the guys who lived on my floor. There's also quite a lot of events put on by the hall which are a good opportunity to meet people and have free food and usually prizes.",

I lived in the west side it was pretty great, For a lively community I highly recommend Friley, but almost any traditional style dorm is gonna give u that community feel but also participating in events like Destination Iowa State, and checking out club fest and trying some hobbies\n\nTo answer ur question about the bathrooms, this is for my dorm at least, it is a communal bathroom that are kept pretty nice, but shower shoes are always a good idea, I did appreciate them, however always keep in mind when the bathrooms are cleaned since they will be closed",

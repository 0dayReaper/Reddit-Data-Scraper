    "postText": " \n\nIntroduction\n\nIowa State University is a world-class institution, known for its excellent academic programs, vibrant campus community, and beautiful campus. However, one area where ISU could improve is in the availability of dining options for students. Currently, the campus dining centers are located in various buildings, making it difficult for students to access them quickly and easily.\n\nTo address this issue, we propose the addition of a new dining center on top of the Campanile, called the Camp-a-Meal. The Campanile is a well-known and iconic landmark on the ISU campus, and its central location would make it an ideal location for a dining center. The Camp-a-Meal would provide students with a convenient, unique, and appealing dining option, while also enhancing the use and visibility of the Campanile.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Campanile is a 277-foot tall bell tower that is located in the heart of the ISU campus. Built in 1912, the Campanile is one of the oldest and most recognized buildings on campus. It currently serves as a carillon and is open to the public for tours.\n\nThe Campanile has a spacious observation deck on its top level, offering panoramic views of the campus and surrounding area. However, this space is currently underutilized, with only a few benches and a small museum exhibit.\n\nAdding the Camp-a-Meal dining center to the top of the Campanile would provide a unique and appealing dining option for students, while also enhancing the use and visibility of the Campanile. The Camp-a-Meal would offer a variety of food options, including healthy and sustainable options, to cater to the diverse tastes of ISU students.",

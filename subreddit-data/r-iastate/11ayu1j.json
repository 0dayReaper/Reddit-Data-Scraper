    "postText": "TL;DR, go to https://collegefootballrisk.com/ and join Iowa state. Make a move every day (but Sunday) before 9:30 CST to help Iowa State survive!\n\nDreaming of the Sweet 16? Iowa State is already there, at least in College Football Risk, but we need your help to get to the Elite Eight! This large online game pits fans of various teams against each other, and Iowa State fans are shocking the world by surviving almost 30 turns longer than we ever have in past iterations of the game. But now our neighbors seem like they might wipe us out and we need all the help we can get.\n\nIf you like [strategy](https://imgur.com/a/13LZIod), diplomacy, espionage, or just hanging out and [memeing](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeFootballRisk/comments/10yai19/iowa_state_no_more_adults/?context=3) about an online board game then this is for you! All it takes is one click a day to help Iowa State against the attacks from Nebraska, Wisconsin, or the dreaded goliaths of Michigan and Texas A&amp;M. We need YOUR HELP to show them why you should never pick an online fight with the Iowa State fanbase!\n\nEach day you have until 9:30pm CST to go to https://collegefootballrisk.com/ and attack or defend a territory. The more players for a particular team that attacks or defends a territory, the more likely that team is to win, so that's why we're asking for your help!\n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeFootballRisk/) is the link to the main subreddit for the game (several people playing for Iowa State have posted memes here, including the one up above!). And [here](https://discord.gg/fV5sfPmNRj) is the link to the discord if you want to discuss strategy and help us craft memes to keep us moving further in the game. If you do join the discord please say what your reddit username is when you join so we know you're not a spy for a different team!",

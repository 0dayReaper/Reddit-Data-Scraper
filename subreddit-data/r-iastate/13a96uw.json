    "postText": "Hello. I have question about which school I should enroll to. I got off the waitlist from university of pittsburgh, indiana university bloomington. I was originally going to go to iowa state university as statistics major because of it's reputation. However, since I got two more options I am wondering where I should really go. I intend to become a data scientist and I want to ask you about these universities. What are your thoughts?",

            "comment": "I have some experience with both ISU and IU statistics. First, in general, statistics is kind of traditionally *best* as a graduate degree since you don't get into the real meat of it until after all the prerequisites. Graduate departments are also what people kind of base their opinion of specific departments on unless they are specifically talking about the undergraduate program. Sometimes programs with good graduate education and formation don't do well teaching the undergrads.\n\nIowa State is a larger, more established department with a better reputation. The IU statistics program is small and recently established, which is neither good nor bad, but it's information that may color your decision. If you were going specifically for statistics itself and judging solely on that, I would 100% say to go to Iowa State first. If you were thinking about this for graduate education, I'd say Iowa State unless you had a specific faculty member in mind at IU to work with. If you broaden your concerns to something like data science, informatics, or AI type things that go beyond statistics, I can't comment on those. In both places, that's going to be a newer program, probably rapidly changing, and pulling in departments outside of statistics (particularly at IU), so any opinions I have would be quickly out of date even if I were well-informed about them. \n\nI would also ask about what you want to do after if you're majoring in statistics. If you want to go directly to work instead of, say, going for a masters (note: in statistics, I think as far as actual statistics jobs, getting the masters is almost required for interesting work), you have to consider where you're going. I honestly think that, unless you're wanting to work in Iowa, IU has better reputation and portability.  But if you're going on to get a graduate degree after (either at same institution or elsewhere), ISU 100%.\n\nMoving on from \"where you go\":\n\nI think, and this is my personal opinion, a good data scientist is a good statistician with good programming skills and experience in practical statistics, probably best way is become a good statistician who emphasizes practical programming and grinds hard to get good internships over the summers. Whether you do that in a statistics program or a data science program might vary, but just on paper I'd trust a statistics person with good internship experience over a data science person and not care where they came from.",

Also, iowa state university offered me the greatest financial aids so I'm really glad to hear what you said. I don't plan to stay iowa for the rest of my life so maybe I should go to different grad school later. Do you believe I can get many internships around the country even if I go to Iowa?",

Undergrad, not as much (for industry). Going to ISU for undergrad in statistics probably has good reach for going to grad school anywhere if reach is needed -- grad schools care about department. \n\nHonestly for internships, it really depends on what you're doing etc but if you go to ISU and get an internship at someplace like John Deere and have good projects you can talk about, you'll do quite well for yourself.\n\nBut like: the grad program is great, and it's a big department with a lot of professors, but undergrad, well, as I said in my first post, statistics is traditionally best done at the grad level and ISU is traditional.",

            "comment": "Bro, dont take calc 3 at isu. Calc 3 is an interesting topic (it really is!!) but at ISU it is ass. Unless it is professor steve butler. Calc 3 is wild. Take it at DMAAC. Take both theory of linear algebra and calc 3  at DMAAC. I am currently taking theory of lineat algebra with prof. Song and it is terrible. The test average it 60% and he says we don\u2019t study. Go to DMAAC and study there. Calc at isu is horrible (coming from a calculus supplemental instuctor). Please DM if you need advice. Id be happy help!!",

I'm not sure why, but it seems like the professors here tend to make these classes a lot harder than they need to be. I'm not sure if it's because they came here for research and were forced to teach. Or maybe if they're just so deeply educated in their majors that explaining \"simpler\" courses is harder for them to break down. Or maybe it's the larger class sizes and people aren't very engaged. I don't know.  \nI also can't stand the professors who try to blame their students for their own inability to teach properly. If every or nearly every student is doing bad, the common denominator is the professor.",

The online sections of MATH 265 - Calculus 3 should be fairly similar to this structure as well.\n\nInstructors will be available for live office hours on Zoom or Webex as well, so make sure you reach out if any assistance is needed.",

I took Calculus 1-3 and Physics 1-2 with her, and I can not recommend her enough. 4 hour night classes 2 days a week is a bit rough, but it is only 8 weeks, so it isn't awful. She also recognizes it's a long class, so she gives a couple breaks and she'll let you get up and walk around if you need to.\n\nAll that said, Calc 3 is probably the easiest of the 3 Calculus courses, so it wouldn't be awful to take online imo. I think some people recommend Iowa Western, but I'm not exactly sure where you'd be able to take it.",

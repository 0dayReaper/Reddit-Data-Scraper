Most of those preferring a roommate are returning students.\n\nAs an incoming freshman, a roommate isn't something you'd prefer unless maybe you want to live with an older brother/sister or other relative, or if you know a classmate in your high school class who is also going to Iowa State and who you want to live with.  Most incoming freshmen don't have these situations - it's not bad to have a randomly assigned roommate, either.  I did and it worked out fine.",

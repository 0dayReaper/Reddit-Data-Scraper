    "postText": "Hi guys! I've been looking at the dorms at Iowa state and would like some information about them. I'd like to know the best dorms on both west side of campus and east side of campus. Also what exactly is the difference between the bathrooms at Maple and the other halls because they are apparently semi-private? How is it sharing a bathroom as opposed to living in a suite and having a private one? What aspects do I need to consider when choosing a dorm, other than the social aspect? I'd appreciate it if someone could answer these questions!",

            "comment": "I lived in geoffroy freshman year (traditional style) &amp; martin sophomore year (suite style). Geoffroy was nice &amp; only 2yrs old at the time in 2019. Its basic shoebox rooms with one roommate &amp; communal bathrooms. The main difference between suites &amp; traditional is suite\u2019s usually have multiple roommates from 2-5 people sharing a bathroom in your room. Traditional is the entire floor (20-50ish) sharing the bathroom but they\u2019re cleaned every week day. Suites you clean your own bathroom. Suites are nice but i\u2019ve found they\u2019re less social as people tend to stick with their suite-mates where traditional style has people out &amp; about more. \n\nThe term best dorm is pretty subjective &amp; varies on who you ask based on personality &amp; what they value in a dorm experience. If i were to do it over again, I would do Helser or Friley on west side because food is very close &amp; there\u2019s a very social community in helser. My friends always knew everyone on their floor over there. On east side, the older dorms in Richardson court also have the same vibe as helser &amp; there\u2019s food nearby. As a freshman dorm location doesn\u2019t matter too much as your classes will be everywhere. A side note: Geoffroy &amp; Buchanan are very much Greek life heavy buildings. If you aren\u2019t greek, i found it\u2019s a bit harder to make friends as everyone already knew each other from sorority rush when i was just moving in. \n\nIf you search the subreddit, you\u2019ll find plenty of posts about the dorms &amp; people\u2019s experiences!",

            "comment": "Friley is old but by far the best dorm location wise. Right next to campus and two dining centers (one right inside!). The downside is that the heating/cooling system in each room is hit or miss (some rooms have no A/C). I was in 3 friley rooms and each AC unit had something wrong with it (too hot, too loud, etc). \n\nI liked the public spaces in Friley though. Great to study or watch movies with friends. I would probably pick it again to be honest, but I can't really speak for any other dorms.",

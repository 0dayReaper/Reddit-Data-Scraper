            "comment": "Depends, what is your major? If you are aerospace, mechanical, electrical, computer, or software, I would highly recommend signing up for [Make to Innovate](https://m2i.aere.iastate.edu/make-to-innovate-projects/) through the aerospace department. It is not a club per se but a one or two-credit class depending on your year in school. Basically, you sign up and join one of the project groups to work on an aerospace-related project. They have groups that make satellites, rovers, astronaut tools, rockets, drones, etc. Several participate in NASA competitions where they travel to a NASA center to compete.\n\nI like it much better than being in a club because you communicate often with your faculty mentor and the program leaders, who are great for letters of rec, and I find that these relationships are stronger than what you would develop with the faculty mentor for a club who you would likely see less often. The class is arranged, so your group picks the times to meet, and you work when you are able to. They have a big lab space in Howe Hall with lots of tools to work on your project. It is really easy to start getting a lot of hands-on engineering experience since you have to submit weekly reports of what you worked on, and having a grade attached to the class makes you more motivated to dedicate time to the project.\n\nClass is an easy A if you put your hours in. During the semester, they have expos where you can share your project with other students/faculty and occasionally industry leaders. I started Make to Innovate right away during my first semester at ISU, and it landed me an aerospace internship the summer after my freshman year. I made several great friends through the program who also obtained highly selective aerospace industry internships due to their participation, and I can't recommend the program enough. There can also be leadership positions available within your group if you want that type of experience. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions or look at their website linked above.",

No prior knowledge is required, and we teach/learn as we go. Our team has decades of experience, so there's plenty to learn. And we have fun while doing it. And and, *we're recruiting* for the fall semester for starting our new car. Highly recommend!",

A lot of our group is graduating tho and so we\u2019re looking for new people.",

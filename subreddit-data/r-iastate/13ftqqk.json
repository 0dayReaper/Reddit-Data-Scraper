I think the balance is something like $500. If your car gets towed, you don't necessarily have to pay the university. You just have to go to the towing company and pay their fee. But you would probably get towed again",

If your car is titled/registered in your name, they will be able to figure out who you are (even if its another state). \n\nThey don't really go to that effort unless you \"earn\" the honor of being towed. In that case, they will give the details they have on the car to ISU PD, and the police will get a hold of you to let you know what happened. \n\nIf it's just for an unpaid ticket, they will send your details to a collections company and let them deal with contacting you",

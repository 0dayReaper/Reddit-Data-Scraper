If someone notices you\u2019re doing something wrong and are in danger they will help, it\u2019s part of the culture. As far as how to rent equipment, climb correctly with a harness and ropes, that\u2019s what the rec staff is for. And you can 100% ask them. I\u2019ve been climbing for a few years and I ask them stuff all the time about routes and beta etc. if you just want to try bouldering (no ropes, short wall) then just rent a pair of shoes and do your best. Newbies welcomed :)",

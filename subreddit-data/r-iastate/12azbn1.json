    "postText": "So I have a club idea now; maybe it's been done before, but I haven't heard anything about it. So here's the idea, \n\nNow public speaking is something very few want to do, and when you have to give a presentation, it can be the worse feeling in the world. Now, what sucks is, on average, you may only have to give a handful of presentations a year, so how can you possibly improve and get used to being in front of so many people. Now, of course, you can practice a presentation over and over, maybe even in front of some friends, but it's never really giving you the actual experience of presenting until you are on stage. \n\nSo I'm thinking of a group that would get together once, maybe twice or even more a month and would allow anybody who wanted to the chance to get on stage and present. They could present an upcoming school project or talk about a hobby of theirs or do some improv or just get on the stage and get used to the environment. If you want to get in front of the audience, then you can do so. This would allow people multiple times throughout the year to get used to public speaking and being in front of so many people. So basically a public speaking club with the sole purpose of helping people improve and become more comfortable on stage in a laid-back environment with fellow people who want to improve. \n\nSo what are everyone's thoughts on this? Has it been done, or would people even be interested?",

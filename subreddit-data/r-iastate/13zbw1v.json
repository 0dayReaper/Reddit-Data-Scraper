I think Friley is a good choice. Some of the rooms can be pretty big. They just remodeled (or are currently remodeling) some of the bathrooms, so you could luck out and get a nicer house. Friley is also good for access to dining centers, bus routes, and state gym.\n\nYou'll be fine in whatever dorm you pick/get assigned. Don't worry about it too much.",

Shower lines weren't long. The big convenience was having 3 different eating options (Clyde's, UDCC, Windows) with windows being IN Friley, which is great for the winter. Overall great experience with good open hangout areas; however, my dorm life was in 18-19 before COVID so I am unsure about the social changes since then.",

            "comment": "I worked for the DOR for a really long time and each have pros and cons. \n\nI will first say that there are learning communities that you can join that help you get a social network to connect with. Often times they are college based so they will be folks that you are likely to regularly see around campus and/or in your classes. These learning communities are not just located in one area, there are several different learning communities in several different resident halls. \n\nIf you're worried about money, Friley is the cheapest place to be, and does have a rep for being pretty social since it is so large. As to house-to-house community vibes, it really depends on how social the residents are. If you're in engineering, Friley is very close to the majority of the engineering buildings, which is nice. Note that not all rooms in Friley have air conditioning, which sometimes is a big turn off for folks. Friley is also sometimes hit or miss on their common areas. Some are great, others are not. \n\nIf you're in LAS, Geoffrey and Willow are closer to those buildings. That said, Geoffrey is definitely more expensive than Willow. The Maple Willow Larch complex (MWL) does also have a dining center included in the building that is open for late night meals. This is a nice perk to consider that Geoffrey does not. I did not live in Willow specifically, but I did in Maple. I know Maple has individual restrooms and showers, I assume Willow is the same but I do not know gor certain. \n\nLastly, working as an RA in Geoffrey, there tends to be a large sorority population that lives in Geoffrey. Some people are looking for that or absolutely hate that. So that's my last mention. \n\nTLDR: \nOrder of expensiveness: Geoffrey &gt; Willow &gt; Friley\nIn building dining: Friley and Willow",

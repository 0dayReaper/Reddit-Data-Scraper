I\u2019m always going to say that friley is the best place to live as it\u2019s in the best area on campus with its own dining hall and another one super close. If your main goal is to be on campus, it\u2019s most important to choose the best location, in my opinion. I couldn\u2019t imagine living anywhere but friley, helser, eaton, or martin. At that point, I\u2019d get an apartment. That\u2019s just what works for me. I hope others with experience in other dorms are able to help you.",

They offer two person and two bedroon or four person and four bedroom options, so you'll have your own bedroom as well as a kitchen, living room, laundry room, and bathroom to share. The one caveat is, while it's technically on campus, it's on the outskirts, so it's a bit of walk to get to most things.",

            "comment": "Over 10yrs ago I lived in Buchanan, which is across the street from the MU, by all the Greek housing.  The details below were at that time.  Each room has heat and AC that you can control.  You practically have your own bathroom, only sharing with your roommate and/or next door neighbor(s) \u201cdepends if you in a single or double.\u201d  If a double, you are sharing the bathroom with at most 3 other people, sink in your dorm.  If a single, then you share the bathroom with only one other person and no sink in room, but in bathroom. \n\nThe 3rd floor tended to be the social floor.  The top 2 floors are/were 21+ only.  The building as a whole I thought was very friendly.  Though I am very outgoing and practically knew everyone there, even the maintenance folks (that came in handy a lot).  If I recall correctly all the basketball girls lived on floor 7 (if that matters).  I was a transfer student, so I was able to live there (I feel that was a requirement, if not a transfer I think you had to be at least 19).  Lots of laundry machines, rec room in basement, each floor had a \u201ckitchenette\u201d.  So stove, oven, sink, TV, tables, couches, microwave.  On-site parking, but odds are you won\u2019t or cannot get as a freshman, or even a transfer iirc.  I had to park at stadium my first year there.  Only downside I guess is a meal plan is required.  \n\nI hope this helps if you meet the requirements (if they still exist).  Again this is slightly over 10yrs ago knowledge, but I hope this helps.",

He would play the entire series (including the \u201cmovies\u201d) of Futurama throughout the semesters.  Wanna say we got through them twice.  I think he was the only one to ever reserve it.   Quite a few people would show up.  A lot of good memories made in Buchanan.",

The love this community had quickly made it my most watched video (by a factor of about 100). Today a clip from it made its way onto a [montage video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/DkJ-50GLi2I?t=43) (I show up around the 43 second mark); and I wanted to share. (Fun bonus, if you search \"[living through 2020](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=living+through+2020)\" you will see the image they chose to go with for promoting the video.)\n\nThanks for all of the love that this community has. I hope you are doing well and make sure to take care of yourself and keep an eye on your loved ones.",

Im not even in your classes anymore, but I hope more professors take note of this teaching strategy. \n\nCalc tended to whoop my little adhd self, but it was the class I was always inclined to study for because of how accessible you made learning.

            "comment": "I took DS 301, 303, and Stat 347 with Lynna so I feel that I can weigh in.   \n\n\nWhile she may not be my favorite professor, she is knowledgeable in these areas and can be a good resource for questions that you may have, however it is very much up to you to make the most of the class. There is very little handholding and it is really up to you to learn certain materials on your own, and you really need to have a strong foundation to be successful in the course.   \n\n\nThe homework's to me were very intimidating, as I would spend hours working on them only to still struggle to finish them, and receive poor grades on them. I still strongly encourage to do them as they are closely related to what might appear on exams - when I took these courses (ranging from Spring 2021 through Fall 2022) the exams were all online take home exams - so being able to look back on homework and see what I did was very beneficial.   \n\n\nThe lectures are theory heavy, but while not required for you grade, there are many important pieces of information given that are not in the PowerPoints and lecture notes. It is also where Lynna goes through code demos, which if you don't attend lecture can be difficult to understand. This is very much important as most of the homework and exam answers can be gained from these answers.   \n\n\nPersonally I would not take another course with her again, not because her courses are bad, or that she is an unfair professor. I just learn learn in a different way that how she teaches, and it makes these courses difficult and unpleasant for me.",

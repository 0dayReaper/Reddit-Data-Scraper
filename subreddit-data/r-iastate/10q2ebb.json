            "comment": "A pump of vanilla syrup is 70c and milk alternatives are also 70c (or maybe 80c I don\u2019t remember for sure off the top of my head). I\u2019ve been going to the cafes pretty regularly since freshman year and the prices haven\u2019t noticeably changed from what I can tell. I think it\u2019s scummy to charge so much for milk alternatives, but most coffee shops do so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f the added syrup and milk alt probably tacked an extra 1$ or more on the cost of your latte.",

They also had $1,25 medium drip coffee every Monday (loved that bc first semester it was the only coffee I could afford). Imo sparks in the student innovation center is a way better option.",

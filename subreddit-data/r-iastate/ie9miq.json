ISU was embarrassed on national television. That's why the new policies were created, not 50% of ticket holders at the football games, not students wearing masks at destination Iowa State or the small gatherings of socially distanced students wearing masks at the cyclone cinema, but hundreds of students throughout the city standing shoulder to shoulder playing Cornhole saying \"yeah, I believe the disease is a hoax\" and \"I don't care, only old people die\".  \n\n\nIn fact, any of the things made fun of in this meme could still be done with the new policies in place. What can't you do? Attend large parties and get drunk, boohoo. No one should be complaining about these new policies. Grow up. Not partying for 6 more months won't kill you, covid could. Sure, statistics show it probably won't, I'm currently self-isolating while asymptomatic, but you know what large outbreaks will do? Shut down the campus. I don't think anyone wants that...\n\nI'm not trying to flame you or anything, but I have no respect for people who don't give two shits about the disease and prioritize having fun and their social life over academics and safety.",

And this does nothing for gdi parties.\n\nThe vague part is the isu email doesn't constitute what seperates a \"large\" party from a \"not large\" one, they don't say what the punishment will be for violators(they allude to suspending, but it's highly unlikely that they're going to suspend thousands of students).  They don't say how it will be enforced.  Many campus events are mostly business as usual (with mandated masks, but masks aren't not some magical forcefield, they help somewhat).\n\nThe reason they decided to have in person classes was purely monetary.  They were worried students were more likely to enroll in community college/ have a gap year if it was purely online learning.  This is all about money at the end of the day.",

The hometown that I am from has a college and just a few days ago 17 students were suspended for partying during covid. I don't think it's as unlikely as you think.

Count on 36k+ students to each individually make the decision to sacrifice and each behave responsibly, when even 10% percent of students NOT doing that will create massive problems.\n2. Have online classes.\n\nPretty black and white.  Don't blame 18-22 year old barely functioning alcoholics for not making the public health conscience decision.  Blame the administration that ever thought they would.  \n\nBeing a very affordable state university with lax admission requirements means we get a lot of tards at ISU.",

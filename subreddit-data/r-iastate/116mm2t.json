Sport clubs are still on thin ice and the introduction of a higher risk person would probably be less welcome simply because you getting hurt in an already \u201ccompromised\u201d state may put said clubs in the path of the evil Sauron-like gaze of ISU lawyer-douchbags (due purely to the university policy, the members wouldn\u2019t be mean to you by any means). \nTLDR; maybe just wait until you\u2019re healed/if you do join don\u2019t be physical",

Lots of great walking trails around Ames, I love the one through brook side park. Meander down Main Street, get a book at dog eared or the library and an ice coffee or ice cream and sit outside and read. See if ISU rec services has any trips you can attend or if you have your own car you can rent canoes/kayaks/just about any camping gear you can use at Ada Hayden or big creek (or anywhere you can get to). Ledges and mcfarland had decent \u201chiking\u201d and so does white rock conservancy which is a bit further out but also has camping. Some people already mentioned concerts at the park but check websites of ISU, Ames public library, Ames parks and rec, and local shops and bars for other events- there\u2019s lots to do if you know where to look!",

Go downtown to Main Street.  Campus is awesome in the summer.    \n\n\nI'd take Ames in the summer over just about anytime.. except maybe fall.  \n\n\nBiggest regret was only spending one summer in Ames and that was consumed with taking actual classes so I didn't have to go another semester. Boy I wish I woulda stayed down there every summer.",

You can get a bunch and then freeze them.\n\nFarmers markets in Ames and Des Moines are nice. \n\nDes Moines has some fun festivals and and live music events, things to do around downtown, lots of bike trails.\n\nAmes also has several nice places with trails through the woods, my favorite being Reactor Woods and Pammel Woods.\n\nSummer's also when all the outdoor patios are getting used so that's something to take advantage of. A favorite hidden gem of mine is Reliable Street, with Lockwood Cafe, public art, and gardening plots available.",

Then taking the path right to Ames High. Then taking the neighborhood up to 24th street to Strange Rd and back to campus. \n\nThe other starts on Sheldon just north of the Southwest Recreation Campus going west. Goes well past the Dakota avenues which you can take north and bike up to Sawyer elementary then go east back to campus.\n\nI would highly suggest using Google map's bike path layer to looknup other routes.",

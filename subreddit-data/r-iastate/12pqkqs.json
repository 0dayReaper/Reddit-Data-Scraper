    "postText": "Hey guys, I don't think I've seen anyone post about it just yet, but there's a detour for Gold that will be in effect as of today, Monday April 17th, through July. \n\nThe final two Gold/Brown/Peach stops on Stange going northbound will be closed as Gold takes a turn into SUV early (right turn before the second bus stop). The stop Peach and Brown use going southbound will also be closed, so if you regularly cross the road to catch them there going into campus, it may be best to catch Gold instead, or walk further down the road to the next stop. \n\nI've included the map we've been given as well for convenience! If you have questions, you can call cyride, or ask me, and I will answer to the best of my ability!",

Also useful if you just need to get from one side of campus to the other since it comes through about every 12 minutes during the day.\n\nhttps://www.cyride.com/maps/school-year-maps/individual-pdf-maps/25-gold-map\n\n^ That's what the regular route looks like, so the only real difference is it takes a slightly different route through Schilliter to get to the endpoint.",

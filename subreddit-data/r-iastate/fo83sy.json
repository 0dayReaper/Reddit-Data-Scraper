I can explain why.\n\nThe window design and [model of the bus](https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Bus?file=Bus_model_BOII.png) appear to be based off of a [1948 GMC TDH-3207](https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2015/06/14/hemmings-find-of-the-day-1948-gmc-tdh-3207/).\n\nIf we look at CyRide's [Active Fleet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) information we can see that CyRide does not have any active GMC's at this time, and if we look at the [retired fleet](https://www.cyride.com/about-us/fleet-information/retired-bus-fleet) you can clearly see that CyRide has never owned a GMC TDH-3207.\n\nWith this information, I can without a doubt say that this is 100% not CyRide.",

Bus systems from all over the country retire some of their fleet and then buy \"new\" ones, even if they are old, for funding purposes. So after they get bought and sold a few times from other agencies, their *actual* mileage is likely above 500,000 while the agency mileage (in our case, CyRide) is way less than that. It's not uncommon for some older buses to be over 1m+ miles.\n\nFrom my understanding, the \"miles\" on them when we sell them is the mileage that are put on them after purchasing them.  So like if you look under our active fleet, the 1990's Gilligs only have 20,000 CyRide miles on them, when their actual mileage is more likely in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nSorry if that's sort of confusing.",

Here you can find far more details, but IIRC those buses are real close to $1 million a piece, while a normal 40ft is close to $400k.\n\nThese buses also aren't completely practical as they don't fit in any of our bus cutouts and Cyride administration, and APD aren't huge fans of these buses staying out late at night, because they have to stop on the road and not in cutouts and are crazy expensive to fix when someone hits them while texting and driving or because their windshield is covered in snow. This means they may never be a day you see the lon bois driving a normal route throughout the day.",

A few years back we were on a detour that required taking the bus through haber tunnel. They ended up parking every single hybrid and not letting anyone drive them as they don't fit in the tunnel and they were worried about the potential for collisions. \n\nWith that base of knowledge I stand firm in my belief. I know for a FACT there would be a day where I drive back to the bus garage, whip that double decker into the tunnel without thinking and not have a clue why my bus ground to a halt. \n\nWe all have those days at work where you're doing your job fine but miss the small stuff (like when I wave at random pedestrians thinking they're a bus somehow) and I and many other drivers could definitely miss checking bridge and overhang clearance, plus the trees already scratch our short buses.",

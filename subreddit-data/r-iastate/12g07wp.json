Having a car on campus is definitely a luxury but if you plan to be very active running around ames/Des Moines and not just campus then it could be very worth having that freedom. \nI don\u2019t know what residence hall you\u2019ll be at but many of them have some sort of parking available on the weekends or after 5:30 on weekdays so it could be worth it.",

Now once you've been around a while, and should you stay living on campus, you can get a parking permit for a spot in a lot closer to your dorm.  THEN it might be worth bringing the car.  (full disclosure - alumnus here, spent all 4 years living on-campus at Maple-Willow-Larch, brought my car soph-senior years and parked in M-W-L lot after winning a spot there after fall semester.  Started out parking at Football Stadium.)",

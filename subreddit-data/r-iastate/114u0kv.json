As far as RS goes, talk to the university about increasing funding to the department so they can properly teach the full range of RS courses. They're constantly being sidelined and ignored and defunded. Full professors leave or retire and are not replaced. It takes time for those at associate and assistant rank to progress to full professor. But they're all excellent teachers, regardless of rank, both the tenure-line professors and the teaching professors.",

As I see, they have one associate and 3 assistant professors. One assistant professor and one associate professor for teaching. \n\nhttps://www.philrs.iastate.edu/faculty/#filter=religious-studies",

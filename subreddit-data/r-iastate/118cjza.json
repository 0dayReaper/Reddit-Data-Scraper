Burnt Ends pretty much originated at Arthur Bryant's and I prefer Gate's sauce to most others. Right now, I really like Joe's KC pulled pork and Z Man sandwiches, Gate's half chicken and Porky's Blazin's brisket. I have been to many places, but only a fraction of them, it's kind of every street corner around here.\n\nI'd say you should make an effort to go to the classics in KC: Gate's, Arthur Bryant's, and Rosedale. They're the old guard. Joe's KC, Q39, Slaps, Porky's Blazin, Harp and LC's are all places I enjoy",

Also doesn\u2019t serve dinner as others pointed out. \n\nMy vote would have gone to +39 which used to be where brick city grill is on Stange, but they obviously didn\u2019t get enough academia traffic to fit this description either. Provisions kinda fits the bill, especially due to its location, but that place is genuinely good. Ames isn\u2019t really a place where a parasitic pretentious place would survive long anyway.",

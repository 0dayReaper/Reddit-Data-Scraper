The sad thing is I feel like I genuinely understand the content, but don\u2019t have enough time on the exams. I really cannot waste any time on the next two and need to be able to put 2 and 2 together immediately or else I\u2019ll lose more points like this past exam. It bothers me that they don\u2019t give us any past exams except for the 2017 ones (which are way easier). \n\nHow are you feeling for next week\u2019s exam?",

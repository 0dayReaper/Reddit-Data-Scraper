This was Covid year though so not sure if anything changed from two years ago.  The portfolio may be more critical if your grades aren\u2019t as strong.  She definitely needed it in her internship interview a few months back.",

I think they ask for you to upload your 5 best works or something. Just make sure you got stuff scanned and watch your email for the form.",

However I remember classmates in my core classes who were wanting to go into interior design had to also make portfolios (this was 2017-2018 school year, so things may have changed). \n\nIf nothing else, someone from the interior design department/ an advisor should be able to tell you :) good luck!",

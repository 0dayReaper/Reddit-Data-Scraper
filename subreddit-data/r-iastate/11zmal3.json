            "comment": "If you've ever wondered about a job at CyRide, or what things are like at CyRide, please watch this video!\n\nMost of the time when we tell someone about this job, they always say something the lines of \"oh I could never drive something that big\" or \"that sounds scary.\" That nervousness wears off after the first full day of training.\n\nIn the past 9 months, we've trained over 50 new drivers and are no longer in the hiring crisis that we were for years. That said, I'm still looking for at least 10-20 more since our attrition rate usually rises during the summertime, and we will be implementing additional \"extra bus\" shifts in the Fall to help with high-volume loads. If you've ever been interested in the position and will be around during the summer for training, *now* is the time to apply. We can get you trained during the summer and you'll be set for the Fall.\n\nOur starting wage is $20.14/hr with annual Cost of Living increases.  My estimated calculation puts the wage on July 1 $20.80/hr. \n\nWhat we're looking for in candidates is a good attitude and a friendly demeanor with customer service skills. No large vehicle driving experience is necessary and we will teach you how to drive the bus and get your CDL. Right now, candidates with weekday availability are being prioritized as we have very few nights and weekends shifts available. Most morning shifts are from around 7:00am-11:00am and most afternoon shifts are anywhere from 2:00pm-7:00pm.\n\n(Also, since this is an official statement and I'm acting in CyRide capacity, I have to include that \"Ames Transit Agency D.B.A CyRide is an Equal Opportunity Employer. Position is subject to drug and alcohol testing.\")\n\nIf anyone has any questions, feel free to let me know!",

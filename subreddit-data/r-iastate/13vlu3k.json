If you want something related to your career/major, you can definitely contact your respective department and ask about that. They will usually have some openings that you can apply for, which obviously has varying pays.",

Expenses are very tight and I can only get by because I had savings from the time I was living in my dorm. Groceries can get pretty expensive. I would suggest getting a meal plan/block(Although dining gives you a free meal whenever you work) if you\u2019re planning on working for 20 hours a week.",

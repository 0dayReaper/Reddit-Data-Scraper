    "postText": "Hey'all,\n\nWe'll be learning the game go from william tonight if you want to join around 6-9 at 1326 Lincoln Way today (Feb 1). Even if you've never played before, feel free to join our unofficial club - we'll teach you, there are only like 5 rules anyway. We also have coffee (and maybe brownies).\n\nGo (baduk) is kind of unique in board games because experience is much more important than calculation speed. And the board looks beautiful after a complete game, inspiring QR codes, Conway's game of life, and a lot of philosophy.",

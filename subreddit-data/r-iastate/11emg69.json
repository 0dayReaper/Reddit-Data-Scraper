I know people over at DMACC, UoI, Drake, and a few others plan to but I'm curious if people here plan to join in tomorrow.\n\nI'm also curious if people would be interested in organizing something I guess.\n\nEdit: I have had a spur of inspiration to practice my right to protest. I will be making a discord with details about the protest. Feel free to Dm me to get the invite link.\n\nEdit 2: The current plan is for people to meet outside Memorial U at 1 pm.",

You can\u2019t win with the organization as it exists now, it\u2019s populated by people terrified of speaking up or completely unsuited to the job in other ways. We\u2019re only a few notches above the FL Dem party insofar as competence at literally anything.",

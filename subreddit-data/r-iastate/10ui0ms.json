    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm posting here because the Facebook groups are taking absolutely forever to approve any of my posts. I'm looking for someone to take over my lease next January at Stadium View. It's a two bed two bath apartment and if you can sign by tomorrow night (2/6) then it's guaranteed to be $650 with the bedroom furnished or $600 without. I am still trying to figure out the roommate so I'll let you know more about it but it will just likely be a guy. Please dm me if you're interested or have any questions!",

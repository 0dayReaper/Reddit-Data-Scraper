If it's too complex, hopefully crews can do some switching and get y'all back in power while they make major repairs.\n\nSource: I went to ISU, but decided to become a lineman",

Think of it like your whole house has power, but an outlet won't work because a breaker is tripped.\n\n\nEDIT: Call your electrical provider and report an outage. Too many times people assume the company knows or someone else will call. Trust me, these systems are not in top tier shape and it cannot hurt to call their dispatch number found here if you have alliant https://www.alliantenergy.com/accountandbilling/customersupport/helpcenter/outage",

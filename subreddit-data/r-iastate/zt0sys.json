I\u2019ve been doing that for a few weeks now, and I\u2019m guessing it won\u2019t happen.\n\nAre professors or anybody else able to accept me into a course? If it makes a difference, I\u2019m in the college of Engineering. Thanks!",

On the other side some departments have a policy that prereqs are strictly enforced and they can\u2019t allow anyone into full classes. For example I know English is strict like that for Comp 1 and 2 at least. I would trust your advisor as they would know the details of what\u2019s possible for that particular class.",

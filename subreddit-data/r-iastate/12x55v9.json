    "postText": "I wanted to ask how the move-in date of the dorm is going to work this year. I'm an international student who need to be on campus before August 8th and will request interim housing. \n\nHowever, Interim Housing for international student only last until August 9th and the Halls are only opened to all students on the 12th (I'm not in any sorority). \n\nSo, I'm wondering where the international students would be staying from August 10th - 11th? (Also I don't have a prior contract with ISU so I can't be switched to permanent housing, once the interim housing process ends)\n\nThnx for any answers in advance. \ud83e\udd70",

There's only a few big projects, but you'll need to do the readings if you want to do them right. There's also weekly assignments on McGraw Hill, but they're pretty easy. Dr. Seier in particular is a tough grader but makes her expectations known in rubrics, submission comments, and assignment descriptions. Let me know if you have any more questions.",

I am still not entirely sure how groups will be put together. However, there is a \"team charter\" assignment where we will decide on methods of communication between members and plan on how we will collaborate.",

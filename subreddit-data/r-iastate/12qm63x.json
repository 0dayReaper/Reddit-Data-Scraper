He will be finishing the semester on a mobility scooter with pins in his foot.\n\nHe is concerned about finishing school because he is a good student. I have called his academic advisor, but does the community have any other suggestions for resources or people that may be able to help make sure his professors and others accommodate him after this injury?\n\nThanks in advance!",

He needs to contact his advisor and Student Accessibility Services (SAS) for short-term accommodations. \n\nOnce he has those accommodations,  SAS will email all of his professors with them and then he'll have to meet with those professors to talk about how to implement them. For the most part, it would probably just be \"Student can be x minutes late and leave x minutes early without penalty\", but SAS and your son will work together to determine what he needs to succeed while injured.\n\nEdit: FERPA not HIPAA.

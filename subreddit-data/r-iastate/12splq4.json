            "comment": "If you're in the dorms, especially Helser and Old RCA, leave your door open when you're in, and buy a couple nerf guns; I guarantee you won't be bored.\n\nOther than that, it really depends on what activities you're in.  Most of the activity clubs meet on weekends.  And then there's there's game day if you're into that.  Football and men's basketball are ticketed, but wrestling, gynmastics, volleyball, and women's basketball are free admission for students.\n\nKURE runs two events over the year: [Kaleidoquiz (in the spring) and QuickyKwiz (in the fall)](https://kure.stuorg.iastate.edu/trivia/).  QuickyKwiz is 6 hours, and basically a practice run for Kaleidoquiz which is 26 hours.  These are team contests intended to be taken on as house (dorm or greek).  Houses that compete will typically turn their house den into a war-room for the weekend.",

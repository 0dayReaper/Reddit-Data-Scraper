    "postText": "I am a grad student taking MATH 385, Partial Differential Equations, this semester, and I'd like to know how difficult the course was compared to MATH 267/266 and the Calc classes. I have not taken linear algebra. \n\nFor those who have taken MATH 385, what did you do to be successful in the course? What resources did you use?   \n\n\nFor those who are currently taking the class, would you like to form a study group?\n\nThanks!",

HWs are (depending on the grader) graded harsher than in previous classes.\n\nBut with a good HW score, there's a bit of wiggle room on the rest of it.\n\nI was a grader for the course (grad student), but never took it. So others may have better opinions.",

    "postText": "Hi there, I got accepted a few months ago and wasn't necessarily planning on going--I actually have planned to go to Oregon State University instead because it feels like the campus fits me better. However, ISU is offering me $$ that is hard to turn down. Overall they offered me about 22k in scholarships, and that's not counting federal aid like Pell Grants. I definitely could use as much financial help as I can get, but am nervous about going to ISU. \n\nI'm currently living in Florida, and am transgender. I'm trying to get out of the state and go somewhere where I'll be accepted and have legal protections, and Oregon seemed like a good fit. I also really value undergrad research, which OSU prioritizes. I'm a biology student and they seem to have a good program there. OSU is offering scholarships too, but with ISU's tuition already being lower it would almost cover my entire tuition there, which again is really hard to turn down.\n\nI'm looking for general pros/cons/opinions on the school, as well as more specific info about:\n\n\\- ISU's biology program\n\n\\- Undergrad research opportunities\n\n\\- Campus attitude about LGBTQ+ students, specifically trans students \n\nThank you so much for reading through and taking the time to answer. Please be as honest as you feel comfortable doing!",

I do know that the Governor and conservative legislature in Iowa is trying to copycat what people like DeSantis are doing, and trans folks will probably see more discrimination than gay folks as it stands, but college towns are generally as good as you'll get.\n\nI have a lot more experience in the Horticulture and Entomology programs than Biology, but we have some very good faculty in the College of Ag and Life Sciences (CALS). As we have a lot of agricultural interests in Iowa there is a lot of funding going into research relevant to field crops and livestock, but there are still plenty of researchers in other fields of the life sciences. We are one of the increasingly few Universities with an independent horticulture department, for example.",

Some of my former students went to OSU.\n\nEDUCATION: both are R1 schools, so you'll probably get the same quality of education at either school. Advantage: EVEN\n\nPOLITICS: in general, Oregon is better than Iowa in terms of being non-cis, non-white, non-cismale...but only because there are more oases to go to (Portland, Eugene, Ashland, maybe Bend). For the most part, both Ames and Corvallis are centrist-to-right-leaning towns in centrist-to-right-leaning states. You're much more likely (for now) to run into the KKK in Corvallis than Ames. Iowa is MUCH shittier to trans people than Oregon, BUT Ames is slightly better than Corvallis. Advantage: EVEN\n\nCAMPUS: Ames has the better campus BY FAR. It's more walkable, it's gorgeous, and it just feels more like a home than Corvallis. Advantage: ISU\n\nLOCATION: Corvallis is an hour away from the Pacific Ocean, an hour-and-a-half from Portland, and an hour tops from Eugene. Ames is at least three hours from Minneapolis.  Advantage: OSU\n\nI think you might be able to get by in Ames for school, but GTFO as soon as you graduate.  I think the funding should clinch it.\n\nEDIT: for some dumb reason I thought I was in r/GradSchool . My bad.",

I would recommend it here! I am a math student so I have limited understanding of the bio program, but I know several people doing undergrad research in the bio program so I don't think you will have any issues with that. If you have a good deal for ISU I honestly think it would be a great choice. If you have any questions let me know, and If you come to ISU I will always be happy to help!!

I managed to get (paid) research experience every semester after my first year there. It may vary by research interest, though. If you're interested in anything related to agriculture or natural resources, you'll be set since ISU is Iowa's land grant university. I'm pretty sure OSU is also a land grant, so that's something to keep in mind.\n\nBiology is offered through two colleges at ISU - LAS (Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences) and CALS (College of Agriculture and Life Sciences). They have slightly different graduation requirements. CALS offers the \"Science with Practice\" program which allows undergrads to conduct a research project with a professor, get mentorship, and learn more about the research process while the program pays for half of your wage (which is an incentive for professors to take in students).

I was a biology major who graduated in may of 2022 and I have nothing but great things to say about the program.\n\nThere\u2019s a learning community for the major which will allow you to meet others and have an easier adjustment to the campus. Essentially this is just an orientation class led by an upperclassman in the major to talk about resources on campus, degree plans etc. doing this was very impactful for my experience.\n\nThe degree itself has a lot of flexibility and you can definitely find your niche! I ended up starting off doing immunology research and hated it then switched to researching bumblebee physiology and loved it. There are countless of opportunities for researching on campus and you can easily change it up. I did end up adding a microbiology minor, which is very easy to do. I also served as a teaching assistant, tutor, and peer mentor for two learning communities. I would like to be a professor so this was plenty experience. On top of that, I was able to fit a semester study abroad program into my degree plan (you have to plan this early). The faculty are nice and willing to help you.\n\nAs for LGBT acceptance, there are a few groups on campus you could join. The advisor you would have in the biology program as a first year is so kind and does a great job at trying to create a safe space in the major. I think iowa state as a whole is a place where people are allowed to find their place, despite iowas political climate. \n\nAnd as an out of state student, it was so worth it to go to ISU.",

Imagine if all ~30,000 students drove to campus and parked. Now make the systems in Minneapolis, NY, LA etc as efficient and you'd have so little traffic! \n\nAlso, public transit is totally cool to be observant of. Super cool vehicles, overhead switches, and when filled with people; the most valuable vehicles on the road",

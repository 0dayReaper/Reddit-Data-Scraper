I highly recommend looking it up and watching. \n\nNostalgia - its delicate, but potent. Teddy told me that in Greek nostalgia literally means \u201cthe pain from an old wound.\u201d It\u2019s a twinge in your heart far more powerful than memory alone. This device isn\u2019t a spaceship, it\u2019s a time machine. It goes backwards, and forwards\u2026 it takes us to a place where we ache to go again. It\u2019s not called the wheel, it\u2019s called the carousel. It let\u2019s us travel the way a child travels - around and around, and back home again, to a place where we know are loved.\n\nMan I would do anything to feel the way I felt walking to my 8 am lectures when campus was so calm and quiet. Thanks for sharing this very nostalgic photo!",

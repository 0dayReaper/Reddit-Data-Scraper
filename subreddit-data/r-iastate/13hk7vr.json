That way, you have plenty of time to ask for help when you run into issues and also have time to add bonus features that contribute to your grade for extra effort. \n\nI had a teammate who basically disappeared after the first week and 2 other teammates who only get started a week before demos and it made running into issues and debugging super stressful. \n\nThe bare minimum features are easy to implement and the instructor gives a lot of resources to do so. You will have more than enough time to implement bonus features and make something amazing. Good luck!",

            "comment": "Try to decide who will be in your group before coming to the first class. If you don't know enough people in your section already that you can trust to get work done, the 309 Discord server should be open a couple days before classes begin, so you can figure out your other group members in that. There will obviously be exceptions, but people that get ahead and find their group members that way are more likely to be the ones that get work done throughout the semester, and in the case of my group, it worked out very well for us. \n\nYou will have a short meeting with your team at the beginning of class everyday, but I would recommend having an additional 45 to 60 minute meeting scheduled each week to discuss the project with each other. Also, make sure to communicate with your group members on what you are doing and what you expect out of them regularly.",

I just know that learning this kind of stuff is hard when it's just presented to you on a 40 slide powerpoint, so make sure to go over the material before each class. Then most of the content shouldn't be a surprise to you, the instructor can go more in-depth, and they can clarify stuff you didn't understand.",

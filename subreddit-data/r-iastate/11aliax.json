    "postText": "I got into computer science since I enjoy coding but the more I see my computer engineering peers, I feel like they're doing exactly what I want to do. \n\nI am a sophomore and want to switch to computer engineering from computer science, but I don't want to take more than one extra semester to graduate.\n\nWhat would be the best pathway to switch majors? Is it possible with just one extra sem? I tried talking to my advisor about this but she wasn't much help.\n\nThank you!",

You're not changing Dept, you're changing College, and the Engineering college has higher math standards than LAS does.  \n\nNow, if you've completed all your Calc without incident, then you might be fine.  But if you haven't... well, the normal path is people dropping FROM CprE to ComS just to graduate.",

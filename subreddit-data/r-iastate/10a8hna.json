    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI am a Mechanical Engg. student from outside US and was going to apply for Masters in Mechanical Engineering at IAState later this year. Funding is (unfortunately *\\*sigh\\**) obviously a big thing for me and wanna graduate debt-free. \n\nAnyway, I was looking through the website for possible funding from Graduate Assistantships and this chart looked interesting. I haven't checked out many other unis but this is the first time I have seen GRAs or GTAs **not** waiving off tuition. Is this common? Could a Masters or PhD student (preferable STEM) please share their experience cuz this could be a dealbreaker for me sadly. I would appreciate any help. Thanks!\n\n[Taken from IAState's website \\(https:\\/\\/www.grad-college.iastate.edu\\/finance\\/tuitionscholarships\\/\\)](https://preview.redd.it/fvtd3tuoynba1.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7ffebb5259f622ec6742e842c1f9fe9a4d63fccc)",

There are exceptions in both cases. \n\nAnd for your other question, just know that half time assistantship = full support.",

On the way to a Diffy-Q test I passed the campanile and daydreamed about the dining center some more. The lighting was great, so I took a snap of it and drew the dining center on top, and came up with the name \"Campa-Meal.\" I realized that you can't get up there through the clock tower itself, so I hastily added a ladder to my drawing.\n\nAfter the quiz, I had some time to kill before my next class, so I made a few memes about the Campa-Meal. I showed them to that friend from earlier, she thought they were funny. I showed them to a group chat, they thought they were funny, so I decided to post them here: https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/sjoxud/daydreamed\\_that\\_they\\_built\\_a\\_new\\_dining\\_center/\n\nSomeone downvoted it to zero in the first 5 minutes so I got really discouraged, but after the class I looked at my phone again and every time I refreshed the upvote counter just kept growing. I'm like \"cool, they think it is funny!\" but I check reddit again later and people are making memes based on my memes. First it was like 2 or 3 posts but then, someone made a high quality 3D model of it. That is when I knew it was going to keep going for a while.\n\nThe memes just kept coming, and probably won't completely stop for a long while (although they will probably slow down soon). This is, not going to lie, probably in the top 10 things I have thought of, ever, and definitely the best \"joke\" I have ever told, if you can call it that.",

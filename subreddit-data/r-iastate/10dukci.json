It has great community, but poor amenities. The trade off is probably worth it though,  I am still friends with many people I met there.\n\n It\u2019s only unpleasantly hot for a couple weeks. Sufficiently warm in the rooms in the fall and winter but the common area and bathrooms can get a bit cold",

Made a lot of friends from both towers and the Storms dining was satisfactory. I never had any issues with the distance from classes. Try to get room on top floors as they were better air circulation with windows open in summer months. I chose it because they were the only residence where you didn\u2019t had to opt for a meal plan back then.",

There\u2019s a lot of good study spaces around and having your own room is nice. There\u2019s also a fitness center for residents. In my opinion, it\u2019s a little pricey (~600/mo) and kind of far from campus. You do get free parking if you have a car, and there\u2019s 2 buses on weekdays.\nNot having AC is a little rough in August and part of September, but there\u2019s AC in the den on each floor and in the commons.",

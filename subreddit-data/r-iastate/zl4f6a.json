Hopefully this should reduce the need to post images instead of text posts.\n\nIn the event that spam makes it through the filter now, please report it.\n\nAs a reminder, your account must be 24 hours old to post or comment in /r/iastate \\- the automoderator settings should now give a heads-up message to submissions by new accounts.",

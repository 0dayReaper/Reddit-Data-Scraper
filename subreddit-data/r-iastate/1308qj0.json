It's really not a very hard language to learn, but it's quite different from more modern languages - it actually reads more like English, believe it or not.  The notice I saw on the web said it's offered only in the summer.\n\n[https://www.cs.iastate.edu/computing-non-majors](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/computing-non-majors)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took that as a summer course many moons ago, and now work in IT.  Believe it or not, that class really helped me at work when we set out to rebuild a COBOL-based system in Java.  I was nearly the only one on our development team who could read and understand the data specifications in the old code.",

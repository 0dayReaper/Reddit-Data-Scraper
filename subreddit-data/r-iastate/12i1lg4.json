Is there a place in the dorms that I can get some ice in a bag or something like that? Or do I have to go to the store to get it? Thanks",

Red West/Cherry/Purple will all get you there. It's like $2 for a whole 20lb bag, or bring your cooler and fill it up and you get 25lbs. I get ice from there all the time for tailgates and such, definitely the best bang for the buck. (You will need cash or coins)",

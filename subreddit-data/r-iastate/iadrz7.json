If they don't go back those kids will be punished by not receiving their credits that they worked hard for. Governor Reynolds has the lowest approval rating out of any governor at 28%. Reynolds has blocked any city from requiring masks on their own. She even refused to declare a state of emergency after the durecho when hundreds of thousands of people in Iowa were out of power with severe damage until she personally visited those areas, days after the storm. Iowa is suffering under the mongoloid that is Kim Reynolds and that's undeniable. \n\nIf you need something more materialistic,[here](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2766229) is a study done saying our next door neighbor Illinois is doing better than Iowa",

A state like Michigan has less positives per capita than Iowa and twice as many deaths.  That is an example of someone who is testing less. The odd thing is people in Michigan feel like they are doing a good job which might be more indicative of them already having been through the worst of it and maybe having some community immunity at this point since they were hit so hard early like NYC.\n\nAppreciate the Texas anecdote. They have had it much worse than us down there.  I just went on a road trip through 10 different states and all of them had mask mandates, but in many places we were the only ones wearing masks.  Usually the more heavily populated areas had more people wearing them but as soon as you got out to the smaller towns almost nobody was.   Being from a small town in Iowa I think the same fate would apply here. \n\nThe situation we are in sucks.  And it sucks that we have to look after ourselves and can\u2019t trust our neighbors to do the courteous thing.   The best course of action is to arm yourself with knowledge.  Don\u2019t lie to yourself about your situation being worse than anyone else\u2019s.  Take the precautions you can based on what you know about spread and be safe.",

If there were Cyclone Aides who weren\u2019t doing that, then they weren\u2019t doing their job. I know that I pushed my students and the other students around me to wear face coverings and constantly reminded them about wearing them to keep everyone safe.",

At DIS students would gather in groups before/after but still on campus property and take their masks off.  There are photos on here, social media, and my own phone that show this.\n\nWe are putting waaaaay too much faith in personal responsibility at this point.",

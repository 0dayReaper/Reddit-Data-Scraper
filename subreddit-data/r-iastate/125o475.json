    "postText": "Good morning, Cyclones.  This is Severe Weather Awareness Week in Iowa.  At 10am today, as part of this annual event, the National Weather Service offices serving the state will conduct a statewide tornado drill.  Ames and Story County will participate by activating the county's tornado sirens.  There is no severe weather threat today (though Friday might be interesting...).\n\nAs the weather warms up, we are at increased risk for severe thunderstorms and tornados.  The purpose of Severe Weather Awareness Week is to remind everyone of this as we emerge from our winter burrows under the frozen prairie tundra hellscape and begin to spin our hammock chrysalises.\n\nThis week, please take a few minutes to learn where the severe weather shelter areas are in each building where you live, study, or work.  This information is available on the emergency maps that my Fire Safety colleagues post in central locations in each building on campus (also available by drilling down to individual buildings from [the main campus online map](https://www.fpm.iastate.edu/maps/)).  You may also want to ask your instructors what their procedures are for modifying classes if there's a severe weather threat, and what their intent is for moving to shelter if a tornado warning is issued during class time.",

The big thing to remember is that it's generally debris during tornados that cause fatalities and not getting sucked up into the air like you see on the movie Twister.",

They're active on Twitter at [@NWSDesMoines](https://twitter.com/NWSDesMoines) and Facebook as [NWSDesMoines](https://www.facebook.com/NWSDesMoines).  Yeah, I know both of those are old people socials, but their social media policy is probably older than most of their meteorologists.\n\n* [Here's the NWS local forecast page for campus](https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=42.034660400000064&amp;lon=-93.60693489999994#.ZCRYg4TMIwF).\n\n* And [here's the NWS Des Moines home page](https://www.weather.gov/dmx/).  Whenever there's a severe weather outlook, their most recent set of briefing slides will be linked from the top ~~left~~ __right__ - look for the yellow box with the hazard-triangle symbol and the words \"click to view briefing.\"\n\n* There are a bunch of free or low-cost phone apps for monitoring radar, forecasts, and weather alerts.  My preferred one on my personal phone is Clime (formerly NOAA Weather Radar).\n\n* Our campus weather sensor package is on top of Jack Trice Stadium's press box.  You can find current conditions and historical data at http://story.weatherstem.com/iowastate.\n\nI expect some of our meteorology majors will be along shortly with other recommendations.",

Any apps or suggestions people know of that will sound an actual alarm if there's a tornado?",

                    "comment": "Well, the sirens aren't designed to be heard indoors - if they were, anyone standing next to them would be bleeding from the ears when they went off, and someone would probably get sued if they survived the tornado.  Their intent is to provide outdoor warning for people in parks or on the street.\n\nMost weather apps will have an option for an audible alert when a tornado warning is issued.  The National Weather Service should also push a Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) over the cell network, so make sure that's enabled in your phone (on iOS, it's in Settings &gt; Notifications, then scroll all the way down to Government Alerts).  It'll be *quite* audible even if your phone is silenced.\n\nYou may also want to consider a NOAA weather radio, which is a radio receiver specifically designed to activate when NWS sends an alert.  They're about $40 at retail, probably a little cheaper on Amazon.  My caveat here is that radio reception kind of sucks in heavier-constructed buildings.  They're great for use in houses, not so much in many of our classroom and office buildings on campus.",

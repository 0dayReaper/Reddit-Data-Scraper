            "comment": "I took it a few semesters ago. There was no curve, but they did change the grading scale. At the end of the semester 55% was a C-.\n\nIn my opinion, if the whole class is doing so bad that 55% is a passing grade, there's a red flag that the professor ought to see and figure out a better way to teach the material.\n\nUnfortunately, professors aren't teachers. They're scientists, mathematicians, etc.\n\nAnyway, don't count on a grading-scale change. Go to class, take notes, and do the homework. You'll be fine.",

            "comment": "I took it last semester with a professor teaching it for the first time and it was the grading scale that was adjusted with a C- being a 50% or so. People have said the class got a bit better after the first exam since he asked the students for suggestions in teaching and took them into account. I would say go to class (I didn\u2019t go after the first exam and pretty much used YouTube for the entire course so if that works better, consider that too), take notes (however you do), practice problems, and use office hours. The tests were pretty hard, average of around 60% on each and like 40% on the final, the HW kept me alive.\n\nSome resources I used (they should have a YouTube playlist called \u201cdiscrete math\u201d or something along those lines: \nTrevTutor - Youtube\nKimberly Brehm - Youtube",

If you could create a class, not in your planned major, that let you pursue a personal interest, what would it be, and why?  \n**B. Home or away? Explain your reasoning.**\n\nWhat is \"Home or away\" in the context of the theme? English second language here. \n\nAt first I thought maybe they mean to ask if I would want this class in the classroom or rvirtual, but I am really not sure.\n\nI would really appreciate an explanation.\n\nThanks",

They are definitely not related at all.\n\nThe home or away question is meant to be very broad and give you something that you can answer creatively. The most literal interpretation is if you prefer to be home (whether that means at your house/apartment or just in the town, city, or country that you're from would be up to you) or away from home. However, you can be creative in how you interpret the prompt as well as in how you answer it.",

This drove me crazy, I thought it was supposed to be related.\n\nThere were 2 sections, each section had A and B questions, however in the first section the questions were definitely related. That is why I was so confused with the second section.\n\nI believe you are 100% correct. I must answer just 1 question from each section.\n\nThis drove me mad.\n\nTHANK YOU!",

After about 6 PM on Wednesday, conditions will rapidly deteriorate and will not normalize until the weekend.\n\nTravel will be very difficult. I personally expect around 6-8 inches of snow to fall, but the biggest factor will be the wind. Consistent winds of 20 MPH with gusts up to 40 MPH will be present for multiple days. Even when plows go out, their work will be quickly erased. Large drifts may form in inconvenient spots. Your vehicle will be pushed around on the highways.\n\nTemperatures will be brutal. We may not top a wind chill of -20 for 24 hours+. If you do need to travel any distance, please have a cold-weather kit. [This is what the NWS suggests.](https://www.weather.gov/media/top/prepare/CarWinterSurvivalKitChecklist.pdf)\n\nThere is no need to panic buy anything as four days is not a long time, but I do suggest making sure you have the things you need to stay home as much as possible during that stretch.\n\nPlease just be safe. Tragically students at both ISU and Iowa have been claimed by the cold since I started college. Almost all of us have the tools to get through this just fine if we take the basic precautions.",

With visibility below a quarter-mile, drivers have about 10-12 seconds to perceive and react to a slowdown or wreck ahead of them.  That was a major contributing factor in [this multi-vehicle wreck from February 2018, which occurred on I-35 just north of US 30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QCmuqS0Kac).",

They might be running late, and there may be unexpected detours if roads get blocked or extremely unsafe, but we\u2019ll be out there to get you where you need to go. (Well i won\u2019t be thankfully i happen to be off on Thursday this week)",

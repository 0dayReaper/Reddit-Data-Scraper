However, if you have a group that doesn't put in their fair share of work, I imagine it could get pretty difficult since the class is largely up to the group to set their own deadlines and how closely they follow them. At least for me, CprE 288 and EE 230 which I'm also taking right now, are significantly more time-consuming. Though I don't know much about 381 or 311 since I haven't taken them yet, I have heard 311 is incredibly difficult, so it may be better to take that in a semester that's otherwise less difficult.",

I can't even think of what that would achieve if you did click the link (although I never clicked on it so maybe it just tries to get data from you or something)",

Unfortunately, the main groups need the admin\u2019s approval I answered all questions and still waiting. Other pages/groups don't have that many of options and are full of weird links. I hope I can find a proper place to look for a room for the summer semester. Anyhow, I don't recommend clicking those links as cybersecurity is a big issue nowadays and we all have valuable data. Good luck",

Often a line for the showers.  Always waiting for a dryer.  Always.  ALWAYS.  Seriously, goddamn there are not enough dryers in Friley.\n\n**BirchWelshRoberts Advantages:** Socially a lot like Helser, people keep their doors open, you know your neighbors, houses are fun.  Also, you're close to Lied.  Never a line for the showers.  Sometimes no line for a dryer.\n\n**BirchWelshRoberts Disadvantages:** WAAAAY far away from engineering, although that's why CyRide.",

Too many people walking past all the time.\n\nPeople keep their doors open when they mostly know the people walking past.  Helser is good like that, because it's a series of wings.  Helser veterans would say Helser is the most social dorm but that opinion is born out of shared hardship (although I hear it's finally been renovated).\n\nThe real social dorms, which might as well be greek houses... are Barton, Lyon, and Freeman.",

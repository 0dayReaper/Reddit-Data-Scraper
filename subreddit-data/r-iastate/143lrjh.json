Easy things to think of is if you want to be in a wet or a dry house (can or can't have alcohol in house) and then just start figuring out the group of guys you want to hangout with. Good luck with rush\n\nLots of the fraternities are similar groups of guys, it comes down to who you fit in with the most",

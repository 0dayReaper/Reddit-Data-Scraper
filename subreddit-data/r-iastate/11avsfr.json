    "postText": "I\u2019m in my senior capstone for ME right now (specifying because I know ConE can kick out bad group members, pretty sure MEs cannot) and there is one member who is totally worthless.\n\nThis member usually shows up for 1 of the 3 required weekly meetings, so is hardly ever even there. He also hasn\u2019t brought a laptop, pen, paper, or even a backpack yet. He just plays games on his phone if he bothers showing up. He has not even opened any documents our group has shared (they\u2019re online so I can check, and it\u2019s almost week 7!!). Also, he has avoided any required outside of class activities and has encouraged other team members to skip class. One of the more annoying things he does is tells the rest of us that we need to make sure to turn stuff in on time lolol. This student is genuinely holding us back, and the professor knows that this student is not helping us and never shows up. We have asked him to help out and says he will and then doesn\u2019t do anything.\n\nIt may sound petty, but I really don\u2019t think this student deserves credit for this course, after all of the work the rest of our team has put in (plus extra because we\u2019re carrying his weight and he\u2019s trying to convince us to not show up). Any advice? Or anything I can do?",

What I would recommend doing is notating his lack of effort and what he has contributed. The project will probably suck as you do it short handed. \n\nI would sit down, ask what the person what they have contributed to the group so you can credit them appropriately, take their list and the list you\u2019ve taken of all the other work and ask why there\u2019s a difference and ask him to point out his work. \n\nYes that will be uncomfortable and tough but this also a regular duty at any job overseeing people (including operators on the line). \n\nProject needs to be done, finish it, it will suck. This also isn\u2019t unique and I swear I hear it every year for capstone for every class. At the end let the professor know, with full notes, everything you and the group has done vs what they contributed. At the end of the day the professor will be the final decision maker on this.",

In my experience if those kind of people do contribute you\u2019re going to have recheck and probably redo their work anyway.  This happened in my capstone class.  It was all worth it when after the presentation, the prof asked each team member questions and the dipshits looked like f-ing morons. I got an A, the girl that at least tried and contributed got a B and the two deadweights barely passed.",

Eventually, the loafers get weeded out. \n\nOr they get rotated to some other job. Then they have a diverse amount of experience, and they get promoted. While you are stuck in one position, because you are good at it. And then you can't get a promotion because you don't have a diverse amount of experience. So you have to quit that company and get a job in anther city, And your spouse doesn't like the move, so they start cheating on you with the UPS driver. And  then, things really start to go downhill.

One elegant way of documenting things is to volunteer (or get someone to volunteer) to take notes and email out a summary of every meeting, and include attendance and contributions (even as simple as Steve suggested X, and Nancy showed us Y). This is intrinsically valuable anyway, and leaves a very clear record. \n\nAs others have said, this is how the real world works. If your boss is trying to help you get a promotion, you'll notice an uptick in emails congratulating you on a job well done. If they're trying to get you fired, everything you do will get written down. \n\nIf you get to the end and you feel that your professor graded you unfairly, take your documentation and appeal to them for a better grade. If it's still worth fighting for, go over their head to a higher up in the department.",

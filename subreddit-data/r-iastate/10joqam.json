    "postText": " Hello!\n\n My name is Malia Cockrell and I am Alpha Sigma Kappa's VP of Recruitment. I just wanted to share about our spring recruitment to all those who might be interested. \n\nASK is a unique non-facility social sorority for women and gender minorities in STEM or science related fields. We are committed to achieving our academic and post-graduate goals through leadership, friendship, and support.\n\nBesides our recruitment events, you can also catch us this Wednesday (Jan 25th) at Clubfest. Clubfest will be from 11:00am - 4:00pm in the MU Great Hall. You can also visit our booth at the COB fair which will take place February 9th from 4:00-7:00pm at the MU Sunroom. Feel free to also come to one of our open chapters which are Mondays at 7:00pm! \n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask me or DM our Official Instagram @ isualphasigmakappa\n\nwebsite: https://alphasigmakappa-epsilon.weebly.com/",

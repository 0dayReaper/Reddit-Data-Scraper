Anyways, it started rather mellow, seeing just the green faintly, then an hour later you could see fairly strong, almost like waves coming outwards, truly an incredible experience. NOAA also said it was a G4 severe geomagnetic storm, with sightings as south as Alabama and North California. Absolutely beautiful",

I saw a couple of posts and ventured out to some dark spots around slater/ Madrid around 12:30 but couldn\u2019t see anything resembling the northern lights. I\u2019m assuming it was a combo of not far enough north and I was too late",

You don't get much warning, but if you see ahead of time that clouds are clear and a geomagnetic storm is possibly incoming, you may want to keep your nighttime schedule clear lol.",

Last night it got up to G4, which is a severe geomagnetic storm, or lots of auroras. Also, in the next 2 years, we'll be expected to get more of these, so seeing them in person is more likely. I'm not too well versed on northern lights, but that's what I know. It's rather unpredictable when it pops up, but you can moderately monitor it.",

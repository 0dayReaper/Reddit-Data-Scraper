    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming international student. Housing says move in date is 12th of January, but school asked to come 1 week earlier. So I\u2019m looking for cheaper options to stay for 1 week. The hotel that partners with ISU and airbnb are too expensive, like monthly cost of rent. Maybe someone has a free bed to spend couple nights? Thanks",

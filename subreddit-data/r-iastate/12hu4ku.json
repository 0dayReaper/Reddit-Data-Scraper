She\u2019s wanted to go to ISU since I decided I was going - ten years ago (holy shit). Specifically, she\u2019s going on the path to become a veterinarian, so anything AG/Animal Science related would be extra dope. \n\nFor her graduation gift, I want to compile a set of \u201chacks\u201d from former/recent graduates. Ideally, things that aren\u2019t included on a typical \u201cSurvival List for College Freshmen\u201d listicle. \n\nIf you have any advice, leave a comment. If you could include your major and graduation year (or anticipated graduation year) that would be fantastic! \n\nWords of wisdom\nHidden places\nFood recommendations\nThe best place to nap between classes\nThings that you wish someone had told you\nThings you wish people HADN\u2019T told you \ud83d\ude2c\nHow to avoid the parking division\nHow to get into the tunnels (for legal reasons, this is a joke)\nThings they told you that were complete bullshit\nThings they told you that WEREN\u2019T complete bullshit\nHow to find Bigfoot\nHow to be safe as a small, single girl moving from a tiny, tiny rural town to a big \u2018city\u2019. \n\nPeople who didn\u2019t go to Iowa State and are just lurking this sub, I\u2019ll take your advice, too!",

Some things I did not know at first:\n\n* How do I tell the driver that I want to get off the bus? (pull the cord and the driver will stop at the next stop)\n* Why does the bus stop at some stops and not others, even if nobody is there? (some stops are mandatory stops, they have a red outline. Some other stops are time points, if the bus is ahead they will stop there and wait)\n* Why do some buses ask for my student ID and some don't? (Orange, Cardinal, and Gold are free routes, no student ID or payment is needed. The other routes, you should show a student ID, bus pass, or pay with cash/a ticket)\n* Why is this driver just sitting here and not moving? (Drivers have a \\~10 minute break every cycle at the end points where they record values, change settings, do inspections, and relax. There may be shorter 1-3 minute stretches of downtime at time points if the buses and roads are empty)\n* Why are the buses always late/early? (I was using the ETAs on the app instead of the actual accurate schedule, also at non time point stops there is a ton of variability based on stop lights and traffic and load and such)\n\nNobody told me any of these things and I spent a while figuring it out myself. Some of those questions didn't even get answered until I started working there!",

It feels like 99% of students are afraid to show their personality, or talk to the teacher casually. Since I started doing this in my last year (graduated December 22\u2019) it changed everything. 1) it made me popular among my piers, ppl from other semesters coming up to me in class saying they remember me, random people in your classes going out of their way to stop talk in the hallway or bars because they knew I was nice, etc 2) teachers LOVE this, students all act like brick walls to them generally. when one person starts talking a lot, sharing new ideas, asking questions, and importantly making jokes, it wears off on the other students and they start to open up more and let their guard down. All of a sudden you have changed the classroom dynamic for the better, and the teacher will love and respect you for this. When you have the respect of your piers and teacher, it lets you get away with a lot\u2026 in classes where this was the situation, I have successfully negotiated with teachers for: extended deadlines for the class, canceling class on Fridays for the remainder of the semester, changing course structure, having our final be online with an extended timeline and lowered expectations, extra credit opportunities for the class just to name a few. All of these teacher I got an A in their class and offered to write me a recommendation letter (I\u2019m NOT even close to being an A student). I\u2019m not saying to start negotiating and starting arguments like I have, but showing my personality and making teachers like/respect me helped me accomplish these things.",

Once you find a professor that you get along with and feel comfortable talking with even outside of class, keep in contact with them! They can be a great source of advice (and also references for applications).\n2. A job through the university, like at one of the teaching farms, will be FICA and Medicaid exempt for students taking more than 6 credit hours (if I remember correctly), over time gets 1.5 hourly pay as well\n3. CLUBS! That\u2019s one of the best ways to get in contact with new people with similar interests. Also a great resume builder and source of volunteer hours! I highly recommend Students Helping Rescue Animals!\n4. The Mexican food truck that\u2019s often outside Kildee Hall has great food for pretty reasonable prices if you need something quick between classes!\n5. TopHat will be a regular occurrence for a lot of classes. Just get the longest subscription so you don\u2019t have to worry about buying it multiple times (made that mistake)\n6. Watch out for skateboarders or those one wheel electric boards. Cars will slow down for you, they will not.\n7. Trust Rate My Professor when signing up for classes.\n8. Don\u2019t worry about taking as many classes as you can. I was taking 18 credits for the first year and last semester, and I burned out big time. Remember, 12 credits is considered full time!\n9. Save some easier gen-Ed\u2019s and spread them throughout harder classes. An easy class can help keep your GPA up if you have some hard classes that you don\u2019t do too well in",

            "comment": "2015 Grad, Graphic DesignI realized my items are more about college overall and not specific to freshman year. But it's the things that stood out to me :)\n\n* **Short on Money?** Looking into Iowa's SNAP program (Food assistance) The requirements could be different than now but I was enrolled in my junior and senior year when I worked part time. I worked 20 or so hours and was able to buy more and healthy food which helped immensely!  [https://hhs.iowa.gov/food-assistance/SNAP](https://hhs.iowa.gov/food-assistance/SNAP)\n* **My biggest regret is that I didn't** **study abroad** in my later college years. I love traveling abroad now, but spending several months actually living somewhere is something else. My now husband studied abroad in England back in 2012, and just this past year we traveled back to London and met his British friends he still keeps in touch with! The world is bigger than Iowa.\n* **Spending the summers at ISU was one of my highlights in my years when I lived in apartments**. I had friends that stuck around because of internships, summer classes, or home was many states away. it was too much work to find a sublet. So we stayed the summers and it was a blast! The town get quieter and slows down compared to the school year...but there's still people to hang out with. Also way less traffic. The weather is nice and the campus is gorgeous.\n* Less people around in summer + warmer weather = **Great time for the curtiss to Beardshear run. Just saying.**\n* **Ledges State Park and High Trestle Trail bridge** are nice areas nearby to get out and explore outside Ames. Also nice date spots.\n* Have a good balance of everything. Schoolwork is important, your health is important (mentally and physically), and being social is also important. Leave some time to party.\n* I didn't bring a car freshman year. I brought a car when I moved off campus. But very useful if you have a job where the cyride doesn't really go. I worked in hickory park catering for a summer and I had to get people to drop me off at home sometimes because the cyride didn't run late enough.",

The vast majority of degrees are hardest during Sophomore and Junior years, so lean into that and leave ISU off some easy semesters.\n\n- Go to a home football game at least once, even if you don't like football it's still a great time\n\n- Go for a classic (not suite) dorm freshman year\n\n- The fastest way to make friends freshman year is to go door to door on your first day moving in and asking everyone on your floor to lunch/dinner\n\n- Go to ISU Afterdark, it's always a good time.\n\n- The most fun thing you can do at Afterdark is to grab a table up front at Bingo and get rowdy. The energy is contagious and it will be the best time you've ever had playing bingo..\n\n- Stay away from the geese. They will attack.",

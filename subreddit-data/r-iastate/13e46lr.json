    "postText": "There has been pretty much exclusively one TA answering questions the whole semester (two others made a couple of responses but that was at the start of the semester) and the one who was answering questions hasn't posted anything in ***three weeks.*** Considering the final is happening today it seems strange that they haven't even bothered to answer a single question or concern about the final on there. With a total of 5 TAs, two professors, and two co-teachers its crazy to me that only 3 of them have posted on there.",

            "comment": "For Ames, there are quite a few. For starters, there's the M Shop located in the MU. They've always had really solid talent. You can check out their Instagram or website for shows. Another cool place is a DIY venue called The A Hole. They host a lot of local bands but also draw in talent from other states too.\n\nAs for Des Moines, one of my favorite places was Vaudeville Mews but that sadly closed down in 2020 (RIP). If a small venue is your vibe though xBk Live in the Drake neighborhood is pretty good. Wooly's is pretty popular and has good shows often. Horizon Events Center (FKA Seven Flags Event Center) is solid as well - the likes of Beach House and Cage the Elephant have played there. As for specific events, 80/35 happens in the summer but the lineups haven't been as good in recent years IMO but it's hard to keep pumping out lineups when your debut was The Flaming Lips. However, I always love going. Hinterland in St. Charles was a great experience when I attended as well.",

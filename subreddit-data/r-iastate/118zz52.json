Even though we are 1/4 in, you can still get most of that %. Plus there is 2% help hour. So overall 34% just from that. So it leaves room for the crappy exam scores. With the curve it will help. Plus getting 100% on quizes allows you to be good enough to do ok on exams.",

You still have a chance. \n\nDont mess up again though, because this is your only realistic shot. If you dont do well starting now, it will be much much harder to get out. I am currently in Calc 2, and so far this is my pass calc ticket. I did ok on exam 1, but currently doing well with hw and quizes.",

Both of those classes are known to be very difficult. My point is, if you really think you\u2019re gonna fail, your best bet is to drop it. Otherwise, do well on the homeworks, participation (things besides the exams) and your grade can be pretty decent. And the curve for that class will be pretty big too.

That being said, you have to work for it. With calc 2, you have many resources, unlike 300-400+ level engineering courses. \nGet a tutor, go to SI, try to form a study group. Those are my 3 tips of advice, working with students is much easier to learn stuff than it is from a professor teaching to a large lecture.",

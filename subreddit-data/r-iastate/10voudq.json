            "comment": "Are you in Mechanical Engineering? If so, I don't think you can take ME 345 and ME 335 in the same semester. Dynamics is a prerequisite for Fluids and Controls. The department is very strict about prereqs for the higher level classes.\n\nOn the subject of difficulty, EM 324 and ME 345 are not necessarily difficult, but require significant time outside of class. If you did well in Statics and Physics, you shouldn't have too much of a problem. But taking them together in addition to 3 other class might be spreading yourself waaaay too thin.",

            "comment": "Hey! I did this last spring, and asked the exact same question lol. I took these two classes along with diff eq, materials, and linear algebra. It definitely is a lot of work outside of class, but it is def doable to take both at the same time. \n\nDynamics (for me) was way tougher than mechanics. But with ample studying and extra youtube videos (Jeff Hanson), neither are necessarily very difficult. And you\u2019ll find this out with many classes, is that if you put the time and effort into learning the material and doing problems, you actually learn and get good grades!! Seems simple but it took me a while to learn that lol. \n\nThe main thing is to be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to these as well as the rest of your classes. If you have a job or want to have a social life, then you might consider your workload and might have to switch a class out for an easier one. Good luck!",

I don't think you can take fluids since it looks like dynamics is a prereq so you'll have to take that next semester",

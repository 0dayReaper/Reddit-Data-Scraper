    "postText": "I\u2019m sure others have posted something along these lines, but I\u2019m really kind of desperate for work this summer. I\u2019m only taking one class and this research \u201cjob\u201d I thought I was going to have has so far only given me like barely 10 hours in the last two weeks. I need money. I need some way to earn money starting ASAP to save for the next academic year which is going to be very stressful for me. \n\nWho all is hiring right now? I\u2019d like something that isn\u2019t too physical and would be willing to get me started as soon as possible. It\u2019d be nice to have something on campus but anything works really.",

It\u2019s tough to parse through them and oftentimes I never receive any responses from them after reaching out. I was hoping someone here had more detailed info on a specific position",

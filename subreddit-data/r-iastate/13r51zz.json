    "postText": "I live north of campus and I think there is an Ames Fitness Center near me. However, State and Lied gyms are free for students but would be a bit further away. Just looking for a free weightlifting and treadmill setup I can go to a few times a week. Ideally in the AM to avoid busy hours.\n\nWhat is everyone\u2019s experience with Lied vs State gym, isn\u2019t state gym newer? Also, is Ames Fitness Center worth the money in comparison to these free ISU gyms?\n\nThanks!!",

When I called about their student rates they said it was $50 a month which is a lot, although it does include their two facilities/sauna/steam/classes. State Gym is fine but I\u2019ve found it gets extremely busy during the school year. It\u2019s not too calm even during those \u201coff hours\u201d in the early morning and late at night.",

I think the rec site has a live count of people somewhere.\n\nMy opinion is go to state. However since they are both free you can go to both once and decide which one you like more.",

I prefer state because it has more space and more lifting equipment.  \n\nHowever during the semester there is about a half hour window where both are not swamped. I chose to get an Ames Fitness center membership and I do not regret it. Yes it\u2019s $57.78 a month but it\u2019s 100% worth it if you are serious and hate waiting in lines like me\ud83d\ude02\nSouth center is top of the line, great equipment, and spacious even during the busy times. I go at 5 am and it\u2019s a ghost town. I know it does get busier later in the day but for me it worked perfect. \nI did go to the west center once and it was a little disappointing compared to the south center but it\u2019s nice to have a 24/7 option. Cannot speak on the north center but it looks ok in the pictures.",

I\u2019ve also noticed on tuesdays and thursdays that window is a lot bigger. But in general, yes, the gyms are way too crowded most of the day sadly",

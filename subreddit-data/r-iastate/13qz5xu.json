If you can deal with one or two weeks of hot weather at the beginning and end of the year then no AC is really not that big an issue, and is something I think most people blow a bit out of proportion. The rooms themselves are nice, and the bathrooms get the job done.",

I never had a problem with the bathrooms, but one of my friends (also in helser) would walk to a different building to go to the bathroom.",

I had a friend who got very sick due to the heat and her underlying health issues when living in Helser. It was a great community and she had fun while living there but could not return the next year due to her health issues.",

But, if you purchase a fan or two it will be relatively fine even with the door closed, the heat is only there for the first couple of weeks then is cools off. \n\nAs far as Helser itself, the rooms were renovated in 2019 and last I heard the bathrooms were supposed to be renovated in 2020. So the rooms are as nice as your typical dorm room.",

But a lot of rowdy guys tend to live there and there are proportionately higher number of sexual assaults there (it\u2019s like a difference of single digits though compared to other dorms), so there is a slightly negative rep. Some of the best guys I know lived there though",

The beginning and end of the semester are the worst times regarding heat, it\u2019s crucial to have the fan going at that time. You can also have the windows open to help circulate the room. I always had mine open even in the winter because I was on the top floor and it\u2019d get hot fast. \n\nPeople say the dorms are tiny, it\u2019s honestly pretty roomy if you set it up correctly. With udcc and windows plus late night right next to you, you have plenty of food to choose from. You should also be closer to your classes than anywhere else. You should also invest in noise cancelling headphones, they\u2019ll come in handy.",

The reason why it gets hot fast is mainly due to poor air circulation (ahem, people who close the windows) and there\u2019s nowhere for the heat to go besides up. Luckily, the lounge room has ac so if you need that nice cold breeze, just go to the main floor and sit in front of the ac doing homework or something.",

Some of my friends I still have after graduation came from Helser. But candidly speaking, the no air conditioning got me. You need a good nice fan to help push enough cool air into the room, maybe even 2 fans. Otherwise, have fun! Maybe bring some ice packs if you\u2019re bringing a mini fridge!",

Not sure about how big dorm parties are now, but when i was freshmen I used to just roll with big crowd and most times u end up at a house party. Frat parties you probably have to know someone in the house to get in (I was in one, and we didn\u2019t let randos in).",

If you\u2019re a guy frats only let you in if you know someone in the house &amp; they vouch for you. There\u2019s house parties in various places, just gotta be in the know. In the fall there\u2019s 801 day the Saturday before classes start where at 8:01am everyone starts drinking (because the rush week drinking ban ends then). Cops are out everywhere so don\u2019t get caught with open containers, especially if you\u2019re underage (MIPs aren\u2019t cheap).\nTLDR: If you want in, just ask around &amp; find a group that knows where the parties are.",

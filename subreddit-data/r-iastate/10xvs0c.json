    "postText": "Currently doing my 4 yr plan, and I know I'm taking Physics 2 this summer at a community college but I was wondering what else I could get out of the way since junior and senior years are looking a little rough. I'm pretty much done with my SSH electives from high school. Also, which classes should I not take together?\n\nEdit: I'm also planning on taking CON E 380 over one of the winter breaks :)",

Of course whether it's offered during the summer or not will vary but this will give you a good start.",

I was out of school for several years before I decided to start on my CE degree so I took a general college math class to refresh my memory.",

I do know that some physics and math classes are supposedly easier at CC than at ISU so definitely continue looking at that. \n\nI would highly recommend taking ANYTHING you can fit into your plan. As an ARCH student, while transferring my credits did not shorten my time at ISU, it did lighten my load. Instead of 17-18 credit semesters, my heaviest was 15cr. So even if this summer the CC does not offer a physics or math class that you need, I would consider any humanities or elective class that appeals to you, so that your other credits can be fulfilled.",

So if you completed 15 credits of classes your 1st semester, then 14 your second, then that number should be 29. Will keep increasing over the years.\n\nYou can adjust your graduation date yourself. I think it's just a guideline for your advisor to be able to determine where you're at in your curriculum. I assume it defaults to 8 semesters from when you started.",

Whether you're also starting out or already studying at ISU State, I'd love to hear from you and benefit from your experiences and advice.",

Search up iowa state class of 2027 &amp; you\u2019ll have to request to join. I wouldn\u2019t sweat it meeting people before school though! There\u2019s plenty of time &amp; opportunities your first few months there. Also if it takes you longer to find your people don\u2019t worry, most freshmen friend groups are made out of living convenience &amp; don\u2019t last all 4yrs. As a senior, i\u2019ve made new friends basically every year.",

Destination Iowa State is a three day event purely dedicated to helping you meet others and learn how to be a student.\n\nThere\u2019s also ClubFest, which allows you to take a look at all the clubs offered.\n\nDon\u2019t think of these as the only opportunities to meet people, I made one of my best friends by sharing classes with them.",

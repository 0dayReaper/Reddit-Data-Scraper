Judging by the Employee taxes section I would guess that it is just taxes. You will likely be getting a substantial portion of that taxes back considering the first 10k earnings are not taxed.  \n\n\nThe only upside to this being done upfront is that when you file your taxes there is a high likely hood of you getting money back instead of suddenly having to owe the government. The ideal solution to this is to figure out how much you may possibly earn in a year and withhold taxes payed on earnings based on your estimate of what you would owe the government.",

This screenshot looks like it is from corporate ADP payment software, which my last job as an intern used, and it is highly likely that this employee just jumped up a tax bracket for this pay period. I'm not an accountant, but these things are something I noticed over 8 months while I worked and when I filled taxes last month I got almost 45% of it back since these programs tend to withhold the maximum based of the algorithms.  It even happened with Workday when I used to be an intern at an on campus job. You still get your money back, just at the end of the government fiscal year, if you fill them right. Sure, it sucks that so much is withheld while working but you look forward to a nice lump sum in refunds during this time of the year.",

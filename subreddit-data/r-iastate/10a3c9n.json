    "postText": "Hello! I just got admitted to ISU and am looking at housing options and other university stuff. I'll be entering as an Agronomy major and I have a couple questions about the learning communities and the Honors program.\n\nSo the Agronomy learning community doesn't have a dorm together, but will they put you near other people with similar majors in the dorms? And if you were in an ag lc do you think it was worth \n\nWhat all does the honors program entail? Do you think you benefitted from it?\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Well, I can tell you my thoughts on the honors program but I am an AerE student so the other stuff I do not know much about. For me the honors program brings 2 benefits; early registration in classes and a good looking point on a resume. However, the honors program is very annoying. There are a lot of requirements and in my opinion a lot of the requirements are stupid/ a waste of time. I only remain in the honors program to keep early registration. If that would be taken away then I would leave the honors program. For your specific major I\u2019d go to ISUs honors website and look up the requirements for your specific college. There you can find a complete organized list of what you must do.",

            "comment": "I second that the early registration is nice. I also really enjoyed having access to jischke honors building and their programming - board game nights, retreat, free food. Honors seminar is fun; I got to see a musical playing at Stephen's auditorium at no additional cost to me, but that is dependant on your group members and group leaders. Also, their undergraduate research program was helpful in gaining lab experience and deciding my major. So, I would say that for the first year, honors program is definitely worth it. Now after that is debatable. I chose not to continue after my first year because the requirements for engineering majors is excessive and not worth it. Though, the requirements for other colleges seemed at least attainable. If I were to go back, I would have turned in my \"I'm going to continue with the program\" form and just took advantage of the benefits until I got formally kicked out for not fulfilling requirements.",

            "comment": "Look specifically at the \"First Year Honors Program\" and decide if that seems fun to you. It's a relatively structured course that has moderate time requirements (no like tests or anything though) for the first semester. You basically have to go through it your first semester, and once you do you'll know for yourself if you want to stick with it. \n\nIt attracts many high achieving students, but it's not nerd central, and some people get really into it while some prefer to make friends and spend their time elsewhere. I liked it, for what that's worth.",

I\u2019m in grad school now at a different university and doing just as well, if not better than, some of the honors students I knew in undergrad. \n\nA lot of the perks they advertise for the first-year honors program can be achieved outside of honors by simply being a driven student. Want research experience? Contact a professor whose class you enjoyed and ask to do a project with them. Want to take more challenging courses? You can take graduate level courses as an undergrad with the permission of the instructor (and I guarantee you that\u2019s more impressive than a class labeled \u201chonors\u201d). Want a community of like-minded people to hang out with? Join a club or volunteer with an organization you like. \n\nBasically your undergrad experience is what you make of it, and you can achieve a lot without ever needing to jump through the hoops of the honors program.",

I lived in an Honors cluster last semester, and most of my friends came from it. We\u2019re a really tight-knit group, and it was absolutely amazing. I don\u2019t know about non-honors housing options, but from what other people have told me they tend to be a lot less social. Obviously it depends on what you\u2019re looking for, but I thought the requirements for the First-Year program weren\u2019t that difficult to fit in (I also made new friends through my HON 121 section), and it was totally worth it for the support system and friend group I made, regardless of whether I end up staying in honors long-term. It\u2019s a great way to meet like-minded people, and to be introduced to more resources around campus. \n\nAs for the more specific details of the honors program, I agree that the early class registration for the next year was super helpful, and 121 can be a super fun seminar if you have a chill group. Honestly so glad I joined this program, would definitely recommend!",

Aside from the friends I made it also had a great location (with its proximity to two dining centers, Windows being my favorite, and State gym).\n\nI also have a friend that lives in Harwood honors house over on east campus and he says their floor is really social as well, but that there are a decent number of upperclassman living there. Lorch-Russell was definitely more freshman then anything else (as well as engineering/design majors, since it\u2019s near those buildings) so it depends on what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nMy two main pieces of advice: (1) think about location, i.e. is it near your classes, dining halls, the majors/ages you want to be around, etc.; and (2) put yourself out there. It\u2019s probably really cliche and you\u2019ve probably heard it a lot, but just showing up in communal spaces and being friendly for those first couple of days (and I mean the first couple before class starts) can make a world of difference, and wherever you live will definitely be better if you\u2019re living with friends.",

Choose maple 5th floor since it\u2019s a mix between Ag Business and Agronomy but the Maple Dorms is home to a lot of Agriculture majors. The learning communities are worth it since you have similar classes you gotta take even for just Gen Eds",

I'm gonna sound like an old man, but all the people complaining about it being pointless and burdensome sound lazy to me lol. Are there some things you are required to do that I found dumb? Absolutely, especially for engineering. But there are going to be more dumb things in your future career than what is involved for Honors. And the community with Honors is one of my favorite.\n\nAs far as housing, do it 100%. Pick Harwood or Anders. Those two have the most tight knit communities and you'll get the most out of them. (Harwood is better and I will die on that hill)",

    "postText": "I am a transfer student that needs at least a two credit 300 lvl gen Ed. I also will be driving 1 hour up and 1 h back every class day. Tuesday and Thursday are bad days in afternoon because I get visits with my daughter. Same for Sunday if it's a option.\n\n I feel pretty overwhelmed and would like a fun class but the advisor dropped something like 10+ pages on me and said these will work. So I was curious what people have taken and what was fun.\n\n I would like to get a master's in Cyber Security Engineering. I like American and European history. However, I have a good range of world history. I also love computer hardware and software. \n\nThank you all for your suggestions and time in advance if I don't get back to you right away. Working on series and Taylor series and having some trouble.",

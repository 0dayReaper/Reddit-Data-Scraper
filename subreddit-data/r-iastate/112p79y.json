Quite frankly I thought it was way more difficult than the problems from the last exams we were shown in class.\n\nJust to clarify, do we all have the same exams? Or does each Professor make their own exam?",

I definitely have a bad habit of writing too much and that may have cost me some points on the later questions because I ran out of time, but looking over the questions, with some thought, they seemed \"doable\". One thing that scarred me was figuring out the window pane problem. Should've skipped it and come back later.\n\nIn terms of how I felt from when I was practicing exam problems, it felt almost easier. Just wish there was more exams to practice from.",

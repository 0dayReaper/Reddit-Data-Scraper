If you have the money to buy a decent car, I\u2019d say probably 3-6k minimum then get to hunting on Facebook for some sort of sedan in your price range. \n\nFrom there, I\u2019d probably learn some common problems that come with the make and model as well as trying to gain an understanding of how the car works so when you do find something you want you\u2019re competent enough to be able to check the fluids, (oil, trans, antifreeze) and wear on parts like the brakes, rotors and tires. \nThis helps you find if the car you\u2019re buying has underlying issues that may not have been disclosed by the seller. (It helps a lot if you have a friend who already knows this stuff come with you)\n\nThen you\u2019ll have to pay someone for the car you want to buy after making sure it\u2019s not going to blow up on the way home. Make sure to get a bill of sale and be sure it has a title with it. I think you have the person sign the title over to you then you take it to the courthouse and get it signed to your name. \n\nAfter you\u2019re in possession of the car with the title in your name, you\u2019ll need to get insurance and register it with the state so it\u2019s legal to drive on the roads. \n\nThen, go take your drivers test and be safe!",

Great culture, leans extremely far left and due to the recent elections, a lot of good agenda is getting passed, including better healthcare, more housing options, legal weed, subsidized post-secondary schooling, abortion protections, etc. They are doing a lot of really great stuff and it's just the beginning. \n\nI live in Robbinsdale which is a cool little diverse streetcar suburb of Minneapolis and I love it. I used to live in Eagan, which is a super white, upper middle class suburb it was great in a lot of ways, but culturally a lot more similar to Iowa. There are so many options here, and it's a great place to live, especially if you love parks, lakes, and nature. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/11f38c0/moving_to_minnesota_faq_and_simple_questions/",

That\u2019s not leadership, that\u2019s cowardice.\u201d\n\nThe correct solution is to look at the numbers and see how education money can be most effectively used in this regard. These efforts aren\u2019t cheap\u2014you can expect about a 1:1:1 breakdown [(corroborated here)](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=75) in university costs to faculty, facilities/services/supplies, and admin. The admin fraction of the pie has been expanding rapidly over the last 30 years, and is part of why college tuition has been rising so quickly. 26% of spending is going to support staff, while only 4% is going to grants. I\u2019d much rather double the grant money, at the cost of 4% of that 26% slice.",

I remember back in the 00's the Regents called out U-Iowa for being a whole order of magnitude worse than UNI and ISU at admin spending growth.\n\nIt was always that Iowa was the loony, expensive school.  Partly because of the writer's workshop, partly because of the hospital, and partly just the momentum of history since Vietnam.",

A base in-state tuition of $8,678 + unlimited meal plan for $4,632 + dorm room for $4,725 is [$3,302 less than the average total cost for public 4-year universities](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d21/tables/dt21_330.20.asp). Out-of-state is $4,534 cheaper than the average. That's pretty impressive considering that this school is solidly above average in that class.",

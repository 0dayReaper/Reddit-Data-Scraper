    "postText": "Hey'all\n\nI have a small go/baduk/weiqi club that meets at 1326 Lincoln Way (abrohome) Wednesdays from 6-9, so we'll be meeting today. Come by if you're interested. We have one extremely good player who is always willing to start anyone out from zero. We also have coffee, some other drinks, and juggling.\n\nSince most people haven't heard of it, I'll give a quick advert: Go (baduk) is the oldest continuously played board game ever. It inspired QR codes, Conway's game of life, surreal game theory, AI, and Sun tzu. Learning the game is like climbing a ladder, especially when you start out, every week you climb a new rung and shit on lower rungs of players. Like, the amount of improvement you have is insane, so I like playing it when I feel like I'm stupid to feel smarter. oh and the game is beautiful, so after you're done with a game, it's tempting to take a picture.",

They are working on a tournament next month, I think in Urbandale. \n\nI definitely recommend baduk to anyone who wants a good passive hobby that you can do on your phone instead of doom scrolling -- but also to people interested in getting super into the game and studying to get better. There are Professional players who spend their whole lives studying the game, much like chess Grand Masters. \n\nThough I hesitate to mention chess, because I find baduk much more engaging (less about memorizing openings), and also the baduk community is much more welcoming, in my opinion. \n\nAnyway, hope y'all are doing well with your club up on Ames! I graduated from ISU about a decade again, and still have friends made through baduk!",

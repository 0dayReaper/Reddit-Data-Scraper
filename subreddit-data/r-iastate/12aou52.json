    "postText": "I am incoming graduate student at IAstate and I was wondering what the best housing option would be? I was looking at the social west since it is close to Hy-Vee and close to cyride bus stop. Was wondering if there are other good options? My preferred rent would be max $520 and looking for something that's closer to the campus or the cyride with access to a grocery store.",

            "comment": "Close to campus and close to a grocery store are not necessarily the same thing. \n\nRentals in Ames are full of undergraduates which can be good or bad, and is very related to the neighbors that you have. \n\nI did not enjoy The Social, formerly University West. Your experience might be different. They own primarily newer, cheaply built buildings. If new is important to you, then you might enjoy these?\n\nFinding an apartment for that price is going to be very difficult unless you are open to room mates.\n\nI would recommend looking at smaller property management companies and even craigslist postings. Many of the positive experiences I and my friends have had with rentals have been outside of the big rental companies.",

The grove is another good option in your price range that\u2019s close to hyvee and a bus stop plus a little closer to campus. Smaller units than the social tho but you pay for the location. That\u2019s all assuming you have roommates. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find much in your price range without roommates.",

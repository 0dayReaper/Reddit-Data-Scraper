    "postText": "Hi,\nI'm a prospective international student majoring in Chemical Engineering.\n\nTo maintain my scholarship, I have to get a Minimum cumulative Grade Point Average (CPA) of 3.0. \nI wonder how hard that is major-wise? How possible is it to maintain this GPA and have enough for student life and finding internships? \nISU curriculum seems quite heavy (6 courses - 16 credit hours per semester) so I'm a bit worried about this.\n\nAlso, how are the student life/ interactions/ diversity there? There isn't seem to be a lot of international students at ISU so I'm kinda nervous about this.\n\nWould also appreciate any other tips!\nThank you!!!",

            "comment": "Iowa State actually has a large international student population (Mostly Engineering/Business). I wouldn't say it's hard but it's definitely not easy, especially with some of the courses you will need to take. Student life/diversity/fun is all over the place. You get out of it what you put in is what I think it could be best described as. If you're coming from a warmer climate (e.g. the middle east), invest in a good coat when you get here, you will get cold, very very cold.",

I\u2019ve been looking at the school\u2019s AP credit policy and I\u2019m confused as to what the limit is for transferring AP credits from high school to ISU. According to the site:\n\n\u201cIowa State will allow a maximum of 60 credits of prior learning credit to satisfy a student's undergraduate degree requirements, of which no more than 32 credits may come from the credit by exam\u201d\n\nSo if I only have AP scores, can I only have 32 credits transferred?",

            "comment": "Yes.\n\nThat reads as: you can use up to 60 transfer credits from a prior education to count for your Undergrad Degree. Within that 60 up to 32 of your transfer credits are allowed to be via AP exams.\n\nSo, with no other sources of transfer credits (like community college) the max for putting AP Credits to an undergraduate degree is 32 credits.",

            "comment": "AP credits generally allow you to opt out of a few gen ed classes and maybe skip an intro course. \n\nIf you took courses at community college like Calc 1 or something that may transfer. But AP doesn\u2019t opt you out of prerequisite courses.\n\nIt depends on your major, but engineering you will not put much AP credit towards any core classes.",

Because I was able to go straight into Calc 3 due to my scores from AP Calc AB and BC. I agree that most AP scores don't get you too far ahead in the engineering curriculum, though.",

When you have equivalent course credits through the AP system, everything which comes from that course is unlocked. Since I got fives on Calc AB and BC, I came in with credit for Math 165 and 166 and could go straight to 265 without any ISU-related placement exam or class.",

    "postText": "i\u2019m a junior in SE, and i want to move COM S 321 back a semester, but by doing so i\u2019ll graduate in 4 years rather than 3.5. my options are to either take 321 at the same time as another class, take CPR E 381 instead, or just take it easy and graduate in 4. (right now, i have it planned so i\u2019m taking 17, 17, 3 in the summer, and 17 credits)\n\nis 321 a class i can skip lecture most of the time for? i did well in 227, 228, 309, and 319 thus far, but i want to check before i do it\n\ni really want to do this class if you couldn\u2019t tell\n\nEDIT: I meant 3.5 years not 3 lol; also i\u2019m thinking of getting a masters",

Do it in 4 and pick up some clubs, intramurals, or just use it to refine your resume and projects more. Graduating in 3 is just one less spring break, winter break, and any other breaks to look forward to and spend time with friends and family.",

So your two paths are:\n\n1. Stay in school for a year, pay 10k to 20k for tuition, come out with a masters but no work experience.\n\n2. Get a job for 85k, come out with a year of experience but no masters.\n\nDoor number 2 is by far the more lucrative option.",

(and obv get 321) The SWE job market is kinda ass right now and if you take it \"easy\" you can use that time to get an additional internship to help you upon graduation when the market hopefully gets better (or return offer? etc) and generally be overall less stressed each semester.",

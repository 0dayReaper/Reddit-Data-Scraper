    "postText": "I am a grad student at ISU taking classes remotely. \n\nToday I received an insurance ID card for Blue Cross Blue Shield. It has all of my information and says I am now registered for insurance, even though I never filled out anything and have insurance through my employer. I called BCBS and they said I am signed up for health insurance.\n\nDid any other students also receive a card? Has anyone heard of this happening before?",

One day a bicycle appeared, chained to the catwalk at the top of the water tower. It stayed there for a few weeks. One day we all come out of class to see a cherry picker lifting a guy up to the ladder that starts way up there. He gets to the catwalk and starts cutting the bike free. By this time there was a huge crowd gathering to see what would happen and they kept us back so the bike wouldn't fall on anyone. We wait and finally the bike is cut loose and falls to the ground, now slightly mangled from the crash. About one second passes and some random guy runs out of the crowd picks up the bike, gets on it, and rides off, wheels wobbling and never to be heard from again. Everyone just stood stunned at what had happened and then slowly cleared out to go to class. Someone I was with took some sort of video, likely potato quality, but I never got a copy.",

They stopped by in the morning, were friendly, basically said 'as long as you keep things in control there will be no issue', offered help if things got out of control for those that lived there, and handed out tshirts\\hats. A news reporter was riding with him that interviewed some of our group. \n\nOver the following years the cops started getting more and more hostile again, showing up to welch in riot gear, etc. I give them a chunk of blame for both 04 and 14.",

A few weeks in and I hop in the little bobcats they drive around and end up at the cemetery and realize that our first job of the day is to finish burying someone. was really creepy and I had no clue what to think.. it was so unexpected",

The program that is now Cyclone Cinema (I think?) in the basement of Carver was originally created-- and fully approved and passed and funded-- as a full movie theater owned by ISU Student Government. It was going to be open five nights a week. There were already architect and engineering plans ready to go for the renovation, a funding and revenue model, a business plan, an operations plan, everything. It was completely ready to go, then... nothing. It never materialized, and I wasn't able to track it as closely after I graduated in 2010, but the real estate sale fell through in 2009. Eventually ISU suits walked everything back, since the StuGov leaders who had spent years working on this were graduated and gone (though two of them were by then on the board of the Campustown Association) and there were no longer any knowledgeable champions to defend the project.\n\nThat was *so close* to being an amazing amenity for students and the community alike. Instead, now you have a CVS.",

One of my friends said there was a secret staircase with a weird shrine on one of the upper levels of Science 2, and with Science 2 being my major's building, I definitely had to check it out. Turns out, they were completely right. There was a statue of Jesus (which was purple and covered in glitter) and a sign that said \"The Federal Association of Befuddled Fumblers: Meets here, Mondays from 1:00am-3:00am\". Came back the next year to show a friend, and it was gone. I have pictures though, so it will live on forever in my mind!\n\nAnother cool thing I found was the inner plaster dome of the Beardshear dome. In between the roof of Beardshear and the ceiling, in the dome part, is a room that looks like it's straight from the 1800s. On the plaster dome, students who have also found this secret room have signed their names, some dated from the early 1900s! My friends and I signed our names of course. I consider it my lasting legacy at ISU.",

One night we were out drinking and we saw a kid laying on the ground outside of maple and we just thought he was drunk so we kept walking as we were on the bridge but we came to find out the kid jumped from 5 floor and was down there with a ton of broken bones and lucky to be alive. The night of birthday we were getting dinner and we drove by the golf course and a ton of cop cars stopped us and we were confused and later found out they were finally catching the kid who killed the poor girl. Those were very vivid memory for me but there was a ton more that transpired when I was there.",

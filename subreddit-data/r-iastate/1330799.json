    "postText": "Hi, I am an incoming graduate student this fall. I just got my NetID and applied for an on-campus housing contract. I selected University Village(UV) as my best choice, but I want to know whether I can secure my room without a roommate. If that is not possible, I will cancel the contract as soon as possible before I got binding to the cancellation fee, then find an off-campus studio or 1 bed apartment.",

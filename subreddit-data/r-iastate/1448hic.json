    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm a sophomore majoring in Aerospace Engineering at ISU. I am looking to add a minor this coming semester, but I'm confused between Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE).\n\nI want to know which is more beneficial for an aerospace engineer in the future. What do the minors really cover?\n\nThanks.",

            "comment": "It depends on what you are planning to do with your career afterwards. If you aren't exactly sure, the broader application would be CPS.\n\nNDE is more niche but Iowa State's Center for NDE is pretty renowned and the minor in NDE is one of only a handful in the country which is why I took that option. There is a decent push for NDE in spacecraft now since everyone and their mom are trying to make space travel be more \"reuseable\". And obviously, NDE is very rampant in the aeronautical world with regular inspections being required on aircraft.\n\nThe lab portion is very interesting, very hands-on, and you get to use a lot of NDE instruments, however, it is somewhat off-campus so having reliable transportation is somewhat of a must in that situation, even though there was an hourly shuttle from Howe to the CNDE when I was there 5+ years ago.  \n  \nIn my opinion, take a class or two from each of them and see which one intrigues you most. They should count as a Tech-Elective anyways so you shouldn't be wasting class credits if you decide not to go that route for your minor. For NDE, that would be the EM 362 class. I didn't declare my double-major and minor until my Junior year, so you should have ample time to complete what you need.\n\nFeel free to ask about the NDE stuff, however it might have changed since I was there. Since you wanted to know what the Minors cover, the NDE minor covers the theory behind NDE methods while also providing hands-on experience using the NDE instruments. A lot of the classes I took for AerE also counted for NDE so the workload may not be too much. The theory courses for NDE are more high-level and intimate lectures. My AerE 480 course had maybe 5 students in there with Dr Chimenti.",

My job now is completely unrelated, but I got my job because of skills I learned doing undergrad NDE research.\nMy advice is to pick whichever interests you more and will give you more exposure to different topics. You probably won't get a job just because of a minor, but knowing something about a lot of topics is valuable.",

            "comment": "I just graduated ME with a minor in NDE, so I have a reasonably up to date opinion on it. If you think that NDE is interesting at all, I would highly recommend doing the minor. NDE is a fairly important field in aviation, as well as nuclear power generation where I\u2019m working at. As previously mentioned in another comment, it was very little extra effort and class load for me. Adding the minor didn\u2019t delay my graduation. \n\nThe mandatory course, Mat E 362/L wasn\u2019t hard, though the lab reports were a royal pain (12 total, each about 15 pages). The labs are no longer off campus, and are in the basement of the SIC. When I took that class it was taught by professor Bond, who has since retired so that may have changed. The other optional classes for the minor that I took (ME417, Stat 231, Stat 305) were also tech electives or already part of the ME program so I got to double dip on some of that. The one truly hard part was analytical NDE (EM 480), taught by Chimenti. Some higher level math concepts are involved there, and Chimenti is\u2026 divisive. He\u2019s one of the most visibly competent and intelligent professors at ISU. The problem is that he shares that opinion, and can be a tad arrogant. \n\nIf you do decide to take the minor, I would recommend finding a research job with a professor at CNDE if you can. You learn a lot more practical skills there, getting to do inspection work and tooling design. You\u2019ll be able to learn how to run both the inspection tools, and the machine shop equipment (mill, lathe, loads of other cool shit). The people there are great, and will help you with anything they can (shout-out Dan B and Thomas). CNDEs mixers and industry partners often lead to job opportunities, it\u2019s how I got mine and how several I know got theirs.",

            "comment": "If you have the extra time to get a minor it definitely makes you a little more marketable than students that don\u2019t. But really all employees are looking for is experience. I would say unless you want a Job in NDE or CPS than you don\u2019t really need to take a minor. Rather focus on building relationships with employers. (This is all coming from a senior who graduates in December and I have several full time offers). You will really only use 10-15% of what you learned at ISU in your job , the other is all stuff that you learn on the job. Your employer knows this and they teach you what you need to know.",

As far as I know all the other Gillig LowFloors (12x, 18x, 111x, 113x, 114x, and 116x series) were bought new. All the Artics (bandy buses) were also new. I believe all of the remaining Orion Vs and VII (old looking ones, 90xx, 9xx (Vs) 50x (VIIs) were also new to my knowledge. \nAdditionally, most of what DART uses now are New Flyer which would impact our fleet uniformity for maintenance reasons.",

They sent me a check for like $2k and emailed instructions to deposit the check and within 24 hours send $1.2k to them and pocket the rest. Obviously I never did it, as the check most certainly would have bounced within 48 hours and they'd have my $1.2k. Funny this same scam is coming around almost a decade later.",

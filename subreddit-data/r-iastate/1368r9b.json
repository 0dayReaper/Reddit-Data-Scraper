Don\u2019t know if interested in online lessons but thought to let you know I give hour long online guitar lessons for just $30.\n\nIn these lessons we'll focus on the students interests, like technique, improvising, composing, arranging, ear training or music theory, and also how to build practice routines and update them weekly to keep them fresh. These lessons are aimed at every level, from beginner to advanced.\n\nI graduated from music school and have been playing as a session player and teaching guitar for 5 years now, and I can play comfortably a variaty of genres like rock, blues, fingerpicking, jazz, bossa, classical, etc... The reason the price is low is because I live in Argentina and the economy here is a mess.",

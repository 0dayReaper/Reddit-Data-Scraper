The thing is, a lot of these people are freakishly good, and take the club very seriously, where as me and some others came for fun. I think members of the actual tennis team are in the club, which is no problem, but exclude others and kinda ruin the fun. I wish they\u2019d split the club by level and just lighten the tone a little bit.",

We do have a competitive team and a recreational team but we both practice together, so sometimes you might play against someone way better than you during a game, but that\u2019s fine! I\u2019m on the competitive team and will usually play a little lighter against rec team members. I like to treat the club as a social experience and get to know and befriend everyone I meet, and it\u2019s a relaxing, fun way to end my days. We meet Monday- Wednesday 5:30-7, feel free to come by or dm me with any more questions",

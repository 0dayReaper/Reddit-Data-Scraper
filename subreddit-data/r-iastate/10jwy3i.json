            "comment": "I also grew up karting and do a lot of sim racing now a days. One thing i'll tell you about SAE, they dont actually care about winning races in that sense. Best time ect. since the goal of the entire organization is not to have the best lap time, but to have the most reliable, efficient, and decently fast car under \"race\" conditions. \n\nI tried doing the same thing you are, joining SAE to drive for them, but they basically pick out of a group of people who are interested in driving, and then of those they see who actually was involved the most in the club, contributed to the car, and they're the ones that get to drive in the race.",

            "comment": "So sorry for posting twice, I realized I didn't answer your question fully but the way driving works is the clubs will pick those interested. I know some SAE teams are more competitive than others. PrISUm is fine with whoever wants to drive you just have to be trained and put under insurance and stuff. But I will say that the clubs are not very constant racing if that's what you are looking for. It's 90% engineering + building/planning/meetings/work-days and then 10% racing. So keep that in mind! Feel free to check out these sites:  \n\n\n[https://www.stuorg.iastate.edu](https://www.stuorg.iastate.edu) \\-&gt; main ISU club page, you can search their names to find more info and contact info and stuff.  \n\n\n[https://www.prisum.org](https://www.prisum.org) \\-&gt; PrISUm/Solar car. Make a solar car every 3-4 years then race them in a competition called American Solar Challenge(happens every 2 years) and do occasional track meets.\n\n  \n[https://stuorgs.engineering.iastate.edu/sae/baja/](https://stuorgs.engineering.iastate.edu/sae/baja/) \\-&gt; Website for all SAE related clubs.  \n\n\nFeel free to dm me with questions you have. I can not speak as much as on the baja side but can speak on the PrISUm side of things.",

Baja does off road racing if your into that. Their courses include going over logs and off of jumps. Everyone in the club can drive, and there are multiple competitions throughout the year. Formula does more on race track racing with one big race on the spring. Formula EV is new- they are researching how to make a formula chassis run on batteries- unfortunately they are not racing yet. And they\u2019re is also aero- who build an airplane but they don\u2019t do racing in the traditional sense. DM me if you want more details!",

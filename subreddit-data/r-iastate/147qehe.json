Thanks to all who helped me!\n\nHello Yall, I'm a senior and I know I should have registered back in spring but there were problems popping up like daisy's so I couldn't at the time but now those problems are gone I need to register for fall of 2023, but in accessplus it's just showing summer 2023? Should I call and ask if I could register for Fall 2023? I need to register if I want to work on campus this summer.\n\nEdit: Heres what I see on accessplus:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53ysjz2p5m5b1.jpg?width=520&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ac4d168f0460eb3e8c448bdeb433f70f0482c5d9",

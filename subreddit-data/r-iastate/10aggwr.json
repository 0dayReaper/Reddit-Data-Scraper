But seriously I want to know if the people at Ames are friendly. I know that there will always be racist people but are the majority of people at Ames chill or not?",

            "comment": "Ames is a college town in the less populated portion of the Midwest. That being said, most people won't discriminate based on race. The few people who do probably came from corn and will do so passively. If that happens, bring it up to them or someone you trust (faculty member, etc). The university does not tolerate racism and there are also students who don't realize that their comments can be hurtful as they lack experience.\n\nAfter your freshman year, I highly recommend checking out the university's UV apartments as there's a large population of international students. I'm from a very diverse area of my home state so living there has been nice as Iowa is, race wise, a very monolithic state.",

            "comment": "I will say that I (as a white guy) haven't experienced much racism on campus in person, I have heard from multiple people of color over the years about racist incidents. In 2019, following some racist graffiti in a dormitory, an organization called Students Against Racism was founded and was aggressive in it's pursuit of justice. They did not have much success in getting their demands passed, and the college instead went with the typical \"special trainings\" approach to combating racism. Since this event, there hasn't really been any other forward movement on combating bigotry on campus.\n\nI have seen and heard some racist deeds and words on campus, including by students. I've heard racist and antisemitic jokes receive applause at open mic nights. I've seen slurs and hate symbols written on boards and sidewalks. I've seen folks supporting the preachers that come to spout hate at students. I've also seen incredible bravery. Student orgs taking on a slow to change administration face to face. Folks putting together anti-racist protests and leading marches across campus. People taking time to spread love in the free speech zone, rather than vitriol. Honestly, it's all about the people you surround yourself with here\n\nI cannot tell you what your experience will be at ISU, but I can say that you will probably be exposed to racist/bigoted people at some point. Ames is a fairly liberal part of Iowa, which certainly provide some level of inoculation from the bigots, but they're still there. Still, ISU is a good college with a beautiful campus and plenty of wonderful anti-racist people. If you do choose your adventure here, I hope it's what you're after!",

    "postText": "Hello! My name is Kierinn (F) I'm going to be a senior in genetics and have a University village lease for 23'-24'. I was not aware, or made aware, that I would not be assigned a random roommate in a pet friendly unit. So me and my 2 year old black cat Nya are looking for roomies. She doesn't get along well with other cats but we are working on socializing her with a dog this summer so we might be able to work that out. If you don't have a pet but want to share an emotional support cat that would be great as well!!! Nya us very cuddly and very social and is a top tier roommate in my opinion. Please DM me if you are interested.",

Similar vibe to older campus dorms but they come with everything you need such as washer/dryer, double bathroom vanity plus basic kitchen appliances. I think the most important thing when living here is having good roommates. Personally I wouldn\u2019t choose the 4 person/2 bedroom because having your own room is the best part about living in an apartment, but also keep in mind that the 4 bedroom rooms are super tiny. The best parts about Freddy are that you don\u2019t have to pay for utilities on top of rent and cyride is super convenient. If you do choose to live there, go for one of the 30\u2019s buildings because they were just remodeled and they\u2019re furthest from the train so you can barely hear it. The worst thing about living at Freddy is probably how expensive rent is compared to off campus apartments especially if you have 3 roommates. Overall, super bland but has everything you need all-included.",

I worked at Hawthorn Market as well and loved being less than a 5 minute walk from work. I only had 1 roommate so 2 of the 4 rooms were empty and never got filled. It's so nice having a full kitchen and living room. It was PERFECT for the 2 of us. Probably would have been less enjoyable if there were 4 people. Loved having friends that lived just down the hall. I think I met my CA once? Which I prefer way more than having an RA up in your business constantly.  \nSucked having to pay for a parking permit, and sometimes parking was hard to find and I ended up in the overflow lot across Haber. \nOverall, I loved living there and would absolutely recommend it.",

    "postText": "I'm currently in my second semester of senior design. We have done I would say minimal work, but it is a 2 credit hours class. My question is how easy was it for some of you to get A's or B's? In 491 we put in about the same amount of work, and had a pretty bad presentation, but we still passed the class with an A- astonishingly.\n\nI'm just kind of curious how easy it was for some of you who already have passed the class to get an A or B. It seemed pretty easy last semester, but how different is the grading criteria and whatnot for the second semester? Does anyone have any stories on how they either failed or got considerably low grade in their second semester of Senior Design?",

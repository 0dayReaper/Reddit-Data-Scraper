            "comment": "ISU is pretty diverse, Iowa in general isn\u2019t. Traveling to Des Moines is like 30 mins away. Consistently, the majority of engineers at ISU are MechE. Around 6000 students here, are engineers (from most recent enrollment report). A lot of people still think we are an ag school, enrollment says otherwise(2x +). We have a strong engineering program here with tons of direct recruitment history through career fairs also. And yes the campus is pretty great.\n\nI checked GWU enrollment for engineering in 2021, it was less than 1,000.\n\nSounds like the only GWU pro is being in Washington DC, if that\u2019s a pro.. Would you rather say, I went to George Washington or Iowa State for engineering?",

Also it\u2019s a lot cheaper to live here than D.C.  I would go to ISU, not even bias talking,  just knowing that what school you go to matters.",

We are, of course, pretty biased but for engineering especially, you\u2019ll get a lot more out of Iowa State in terms of your department resources and post college opportunities. I\u2019ll say, as well, that there is a good amount to do in Ames, but you having a substantial amount of time to explore everything is unlikely\u2014not to scare you off, but it\u2019s the truth. Engineering is very time demanding, so since you\u2019re spending a lot of time on your coursework, why not choose the better school and program? This school tailors very well to engineering. 1/3 of the student population are engineering majors. I wish you the best of luck in making your decision!",

            "comment": "I have a friend who is now at GWU in a math graduate program and he hasn't been enjoying it as much as he intially hoped. His biggest issues that he has expressed to me have come with the campus culture itself. Him and I were talking recently, and he mentioned missing ISU and environment it cultivated. Now, I can't tell you whether or not he would have had the same experience if he never went to ISU for his undergrad and just went to GWU the entire time, but I can say that he has articulated frustrations with GWU's campus and the people present as a new student. I'm not gonna say that ISU's community is better than GWU, but I will say that you ought to figure out what kind of collegiate experience you are looking for and choose based on that. Listen to what folks tell you about these campuses and make a choice informed by your passions. Good luck, and I hope you make the choice that is best for you.",

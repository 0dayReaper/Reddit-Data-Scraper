    "postText": "I got admitted to ISU this fall as an undergrad to major in Comp Engg. I had also applied for spring but then shifted my application to fall.\nI have graduated from high school and am provisonally admitted in a university here in India ( which is not that great) and have finished first semester since my spring application. \n\nMy parents are willing to pay for my education abroad undergrad though it will be a little financially hard decision for my family.I did receive a scholarship of 10,000 + 5700 dollars. \nI also have a brother who is also looking forward to education abroad during his undergrad. His decision is still flexible and uncertain tho. There is a 5 yr diff in our ages. So, my parents also might hv to finance his education simultaneously after financing mine, and that will definitely be very hard for them ( if I decide to pursue a masters degree) \n\nFor me, this does present a great opportunity to grow myself as a person. I haven't stayed apart from my parents much but am confident in my abilities to survive independently. Added is the fact of great placement opportunities and exposure that I have heard about at ISU after attending their admitted student tour. \n\nI really want to know your opinion regarding whether \n1) doing undergrad at ISU is worth it, spending a lot of money, staying away from family, etc\n2) the chances of having a good paying job as an international student to be able to repay loans.\n \nOr \n\nIs it not worth all of it and would you recommend continuing at my current uni and considering studying abroad for masters?",

            "comment": "Hey brother, ISU is probably the best university you can attend for any Comp related field at an affordable cost. It\u2019s good to know you got a good scholarship because it really makes a difference. You can try applying for a loan at MPower for the last 2 years of your education and your parents can then focus on your brother\u2019s too.",

            "comment": "1) I think taking the opportunity to move out on your own and grow is pretty unique and well worth it if you can do so reasonably.  \n\n2) The chances of getting a good job are realistically up to you. If you take the time you can give yourself a solid chance of walking away with a new grad job paying anywhere from 75k to 240k / yr. The higher the income the more competitive the hiring process is though.   \n\nI think you should first make sure you have an extremely strong understanding of US immigration laws regarding student visas / H1Bs and also the consequences that come from being dependent on a company to sponsor your future work visas for you to actually stay in the country.",

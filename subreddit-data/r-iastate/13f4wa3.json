Every week there\u2019s 4 \u2018attendance\u2019 problems and 4 homework assignments each with 5 problems. Every 2 weeks there\u2019s a quiz and 4 exams in total. Quizzes, exams, and assignments are all on Pearson.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty easy class at DMACC. The only thing that i hated about this class is assignments, quizzes, and exams are on Pearson.",

I thought Shree's teaching style worked well, and he was always super helpful if you didn't understand something and had questions too. I would 100% recommend him if you are thinking about taking diff EQ at dmacc.",

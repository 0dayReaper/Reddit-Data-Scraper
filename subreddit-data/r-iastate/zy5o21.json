    "postText": "I want to visit Iowa State through the multicultural scholar program, but my parents are iffy about it because it gets really cold in February. We're Asian immigrants but live in Massachusetts.\n\nHow should I convince my parents to go visit the school with me on February, or if I should visit at all? I'm the first person in my family to go through the college application process and am not familiar with visiting schools OOS.",

It was -20F with windchill, but with the proper attire, we weren't uncomfortable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe is studying engineering. He was also admitted to other good schools such as UIUC, but chose to attend Iowa State because he liked the campus, the people in the department, and the merit scholarships. He has loved it thus far, is doing well academically, and has a great group of friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would encourage you to visit, especially if you are interested in engineering.",

I would definitely visit even if it\u2019s just you it\u2019s a beautiful campus and a great school I loved my time spent there.",

The biggest weather difference I noticed was iowa was set up to deal with the snow/weather, whereas the Boston suburbs just expected the snow to melt, and it was a mess if it didn\u2019t. Don\u2019t know how to convince them exactly, but interacting with people on campus before you attend would be ideal.",

Iowa state is awesome and beautiful regardless the time of year. \nOne of the great benefits out campus is centrally located, not spread out across the city.  For travel we have a great bus system, it\u2019s fantastic and free for students.  \nAs a city, we\u2019re more liberal then you\u2019d expect for a town in iowa. We very embracing of all, especially our students.  Please come visit our wonderful town. \n\nThe other part I might add, you said you\u2019re trying to convince your parents. We have a strong international Asian base from lots of the different countries, not just the main ones.  So you\u2019d still be able to find people in that club, or any of the others. Look them up on the student organization website to help start building the network.",

I would say that finding a job on campus or in Ames isn't difficult, and you might even be able to find a job that uses your skills since you already have a degree. Overall, some places like ISU Dining or ISU Athletics are almost always hiring and will accept you as long as you show up to work on time! Good luck I hope you have a good year at ISU!",

I've heard the social life of helser seems to be the best, though Friley has nicer rooms and A/C for a majority of them. Which one would you guys recommend? Also on a side note, I was looking to bring my record turntable with two smaller desktop speaker but, was unsure if this would be a bad idea. Thanks!",

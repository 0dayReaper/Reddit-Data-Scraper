I'd compare the difference in academics for your major between the two schools.\n\nAs a iowa state student, I might be a bit biased, but I have never once regretted going here. From the multitude of clubs, activities, and learning experiences to the availability of food, study spots, and transportation, Iowa State is truly a diversified place to go.\n\nIf you are an incoming freshman, there's so many ways to get involved, and making a friend group is fairly easy(just make sure to put yourself out there :) )\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide, but just know that Iowa State is a great school!\n\nIf you have any questions about anything on campus, feel free to message me!",

Plus there's a great blend of old and new buildings that are all gorgeous (minus the design building. we don't talk about that one \ud83d\ude02 -a design student).\n\nThere's basically any amenity you could ever need, and even though campus is huge, everything really is in walking distance of one another tbh. Plus there's a lot of great local restaurants, cafes, bars, etc. Also a shit ton of communities and clubs, plus a very diverse campus. \n\nLike I said, I've never visited Iowa myself, so idk if it also has these things lol, but I've been happy. Just make sure it's good for your major and stuff.",

Walking to class at Iowa usually means walking through the city blocks of Iowa City, not the mostly grassy campus of Iowa State.",

For things like engineering or vet med, Iowa state is the obvious choice, but English or writing, Iowa would be better. I personally absolutely love Iowa state and I think that because it is such a big school, it has something for everyone in terms of social circles. I also think, as someone in the college of engineering, they do a fantastic job of preparing people for their careers, and I\u2019ve heard similar in other areas of study as well. I transferred from a school that is a little more English and humanities focused that happened to have a decent engineering program, and overall I think our school is certainly more diverse in its endeavors than a lot of other schools I\u2019m familiar with. There are also tons of incredible people, sports, clubs, and faculty here. I may be biased, but I think Iowa state is an excellent choice!",

UNI also has your major.\n\nPros of UNI: Small campus feel, more undergrad-focused, Cedar Falls to me is nicer than the other two towns (albeit quieter, this is subjective). Highly rated among colleges of its size and mission.\n\nCons of UNI: If you want the big college experience, that's much more likely at the other two schools.",

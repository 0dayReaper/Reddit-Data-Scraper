Does anyone have an idea what the difference is? I don't want my family to have to stay here an extra day just to go to the same ceremony twice.",

Graduates occupy the floor and the stands are for invited guests and family members. Only the PhD candidates are individually recognized at Commencement.   \n\n\nConvocation, at the time I graduated, was more like a reception/meet and greet with the dean and leadership of your college, with refreshments etc - and for me, was in the lobby of the Scheman building.  At the time I graduated, the Convocation immediately followed the Commencement.\n\nNow it looks like they've evolved Convocation to be a bit more formal, and allow each graduate to walk across the stage and be recognized by the Dean and Administration of each college.",

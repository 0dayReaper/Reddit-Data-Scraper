I got the next 6 months for $60, so there is that!\n\nAs for banks, u/Healthy-Swim-990\u2019s suggestion to go for a credit union is a good one. They offer services a lot cheaper and have mostly bridged the gap in technologies between CUs and banks. Collins Community Credit Union is near campus and has good reviews.",

I hear they're good.\n\nTry pre-paid at&amp;t or one of the subcarriers like Ryan Reynold's Mint Mobile\n\nAldi is the cheapest. If you want name brand items, go to Fareway. Fareway also has an amazing meat market. Avoid HyVee at all costs.\n\nBring clothes, a computer, etc. Buy food, shower cloths, etc here. It's probably cheaper here anyway (and shipping/ airline costs are expensive).",

Just make sure that your phone is compatible with the service, they have a website you can search your model. \n\nAlso, if you're bringing any cords from Europe, do have an adapter to be able to plug them in, since US sockets are different. \n\nAldi is going to be a good place for groceries as well.",

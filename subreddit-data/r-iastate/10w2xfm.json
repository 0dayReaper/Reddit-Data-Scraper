ISUs campus has such amazing art because of that law and now, because it's no longer required, we may slowly see that impact decline. \n\nPublic art is important. You may not like all of it, but it makes a building a place, not just a space.",

I sometimes wonder how much cheaper tuition would be if colleges actually stuck to their strengths (what students actually like and \"demand\") and didn't waste so many resources on unsuccessful things and stupid purchases.",

The legs of this chair are: state funding, tuition, and research grants.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the state legislature has reduced funding to the universities, just  as they have to K-12, which means that tuition must rise to accommodate the loss.",

The Grant Wood murals in the library.  The Fountain of the Four Seasons in front of the Memorial Union. The stained glass window in the Gold Star Hall. The Gentle Doctor at Vet Med. \n\n It makes it a better place to be and, maybe, opens the students minds to something greater in the world.",

It was my first semester and I really didn't apply myself.  I then took 151 and did pretty well, probably a B+.  When I was in my last semester as a senior, I had a fairly light load, so I thought I try to retake 150 and improve that GPA, especially since I did well in 151.  I retook 150 and got a D- again.  I just couldn't figure it out, but in my mind they were completely different.  Obviously I didn't need to take much from 150 to do well in 151.  Again, this was a long time ago, so things have probably changed.",

I\u2019d say 151 got a little challenging towards the end but it wasn\u2019t too bad. I got an A with the curve. \n\nMake sure you go to recitation and pay attention. My TA was way better at explaining concepts and working through examples than my professor. My TA also had office hours. Seek help early if you don\u2019t understand. All the concepts build on top of each other. They also offered peer study groups, supplement instruction, etc. There\u2019s a lot of resources available. Also doesn\u2019t hurt to make friends with some engineers.",

I had no previous calc experience and barely passed, but friends who took AP calc in high school, for example, got by just fine. You will want to prepare for 151 exams and don't get behind on the material. Like any class, don't be afraid to utilize office hours or SI sessions. Don't plan on floating through the class, the people that succeeded either earned it by studying the material or had previously taken calc and were comfortable with the material.\n\nEdit: My best advice is to take it online through a community college if you anticipate it will be a challenge.",

I remember getting a 35% on one of the tests after that I got a tutor they are cheap like only 5 dollars a lesson back then anyways I still never got a passing grade on a test but I made sure I\u2019d get perfects on my homework back then you could do a question as many times as you wanted. Not sure if it\u2019s still that way. I think I passed the class with a 60% curved to a C at the end. I\u2019d say it comes down to hard work and dedication school wasn\u2019t my priority If I were to take it again I think I would do better even without doing calc for years I just have more work ethic than before.",

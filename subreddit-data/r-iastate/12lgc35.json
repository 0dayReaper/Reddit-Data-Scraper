    "postText": "Hello, I am looking for a school to transfer too after I finish up this spring semester. I will be completing my AES degree, and am thinking Iowa State will give me my biggest bang for buck. \n\nI am interested too see what you all have to say about campus, classes, workload, sports, parties/bars, social life, and your personal experiences. \n\nI am also concerned about how my credits will transfer as I have noticed it isn\u2019t too pretty when it comes to transferring to other schools. \n\nI guess it also may be important to add that I am coming from a community college in Illinois. \n\nThank you, I look forward to reading your responses!",

            "comment": "Have you signed up for an orientation yet and/or done an online orientation? At that point you'll get to talk with an advisor about the specifics of your transfer credits.\n\nGenerally, students who have been able to plan for their transfer with the end goal in mind can have a really successful transfer. For students who aren't quite sure they want to end up at ISU and haven't been planning for ISU requirements, it gets tougher. (Shoutout to any future transfers to reach out to your end-goal advisor to help with advanced planning.)",

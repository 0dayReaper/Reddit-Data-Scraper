            "comment": "In a very broad sense, CS is about understanding computers whereas SE is about writing software. \n \nAt Iowa State, the main difference is CS is in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS) whereas SE is in the College of Engineering. A good number of the actual programming classes would be the same or similar regardless of which you chose. Since they are in different colleges, CS has the LAS gen-ed requirements whereas SE has college of engineering gen-ed requirements. One notable difference is SE will require you to take both Physics (notoriously hard at ISU) and Chemistry while CS requires two courses in any one science. I would suggest looking at the degree requirements posted online and seeing what appeals more to you.",

Just wanted to point out to OP that isn't the case and it was only one of each.  Apparently there were some misunderstandings",

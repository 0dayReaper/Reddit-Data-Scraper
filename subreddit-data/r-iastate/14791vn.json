    "postText": "Im transferring to ISU as a software engineering major. One of my required classes is stat 330. I have a class completed that transferred in as stat 341. The classes look very similar. Has anyone had success changing what class things transfer as. I will ask my advisor, just was curious if anyone here had a similar situation and what the solution was.",

            "comment": "I had a trigonometry class from my community college that was numbered as 130. ISU's is numbered at 145, so mine didn't automatically transfer. \n\nWhen I went in for freshman orientation, I asked if my 130 could substitute the 145, and the person helping me sign up for classes agreed to the switch, since both classes were titled \"Trigonometry,\" not like, \"Intro to Trig\" or anything. \n\nI was also struggling to fit the class into my schedule, so that was probably part of why she let me substitute it so easily. \n\nI don't think it went into my online records, so I had to email someone (I think my advisor????) and tell them that a substitution of 145 with my 130 had been approved at orientation. And then he just fixed it online for me. \n\nMy process was a little different cuz the orientation person was just like \"ya we can substitute it,\" but I would assume that you should be able to email your academic advisor and ask if you can substitute the course.",

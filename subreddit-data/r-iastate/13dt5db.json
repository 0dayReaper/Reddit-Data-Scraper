    "postText": "Hey everyone! \n\nFirst off, it looks like its finals week for you guys at ISU, so I wish you all luck! \n\nI'm currently a UF student who's going to be flying out to Ames this Sunday to take some classes as part of an animal science program. It's kind of nerve wracking, to be quite honest, haha!\n\nSince I'll be here for over a month, I figured it would be wise to ask for some advice or pointers from native students. Is there anything important I should note about campus life, public transit, food, social opportunities, etc? I will not have a car while I'm up there, so keep that in mind as well. \n\nI really appreciate it!",

You probably won\u2019t find much for social events lol. \n\nWe have good public transport (for Iowa). It\u2019s called CyRide. If you have a student ID, it\u2019s free! You can also get into the small botanical garden (Reiman Gardens) for free with a student ID\n\nMain Street is fun. There\u2019s some neat stores and a farmers market on Saturday mornings.",

Do you know what the fare is without an ID until I'm able to get that? \n\nThe garden and main street seem really nice! I'll be sure to head to that farmers market as soon as possible, I can't get enough of those!",

But once you orient yourself the campus is pretty easy to navigate. \n\nIdk what\u2019s open in the summer, but exploring some of the buildings is fun to see some beautiful architecture. The library has some beautiful spots. \n\nReiman Gardens has events sometimes. The butterfly room is amazing! Although I haven\u2019t been in several years. \n\nI\u2019ll confess I haven\u2019t been on campus much since before COVID so idk if what I wrote still applies",

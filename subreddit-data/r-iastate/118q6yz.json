Not to mention the relatively low tuition for a major university.\n\nTry to join a dorm linked with a community (your major, honors, etc.); I'm still friends with many people in my dorm community post-graduation. Make a point to actively participate in 1 or 2 things outside of classes, be it clubs, Make to Innovate, being a teaching assistant or community advisor, or something else. It all will help you get an internship or full-time job.",

            "comment": "ME and EE are pretty different, but you don\u2019t have to declare an engineering major to start. You can be an undecided engineer since most of the first year is the same for everyone which is nice. \n\nAs an ME I was happy with my profs and the program. Don\u2019t be afraid to go to office hours to ask questions. I ended up being a TA for some profs because I built a relationship with them, and I felt better about the class/material when I knew I could just ask questions. \n\nI had 4 internships (1 research at a hospital, 1 quality, 1 design, and 1 manufacturing all at different companies) and I got a full time job from the design internship. The fall career fair is nice (the largest indoor one in the US) and there is a spring one too. Anecdotally Iowa State engineering is liked by companies in the Midwest, I\u2019m not sure how much it\u2019ll help you on the coasts though. \n\nLike everyone will tell you, join something. Anything really! I did band and it was a lot of time but I have life long friends from it. It also reduced my free time so much, I had to schedule and couldn\u2019t procrastinate lol. Since you\u2019re interested in ME and EE maybe the solar car team or a robotics club would interest you.",

I distinctly remember attending my calc professors office hours and him not only being late and having the most horrendous BO, but also being annoyed with me that I even showed up to being with. \n\nOnce you hit your 300 level classes, it is as if the instructors are told that they can finally treat their students like people and show some humility. \n\nThis was just my experience so YMMV",

It\u2019s not so bad during the second year but it does get harder as you get more into certain fields. As someone else mentioned, the professors are pretty damn good at knowing what they teach, sometimes they need a little feedback to understand how to make the students more successful. \n\nThe EE courses contain circuitry, topics from Physics 232, signals and systems, circuit design, programming especially in matlab, different levels of math, and more. I plan on focusing on the micro/nanotechnology or power side of EE since I\u2019m going back to midAmerican Energy for my second internship. I can say that the opportunities regarding EE students is amazing, I know that quite a bit of my peers, including myself, got internships after even our first year here. Because EE is such a broad study, there\u2019s bound to be a certain field(s) you\u2019d love to work in. Good luck!",

With that being said if you have a \u201cbad\u201d professor or one that just doesn\u2019t work for you switch to a new professor ASAP. I went from a C- to finishing Dynamics with a B+ because I switched out of a professor that was right for me. Also just a general tip plan out what classes you are taking yourself. If you don\u2019t know what classes to take each major has a 4 year plan you can look up. First semester your advisor will walk you through the scheduling process. Then do it yourself because advisors deal with a huge number of students at the same time, so only really email your advisor to reserve classes that have full sections or if you need to drop a class or switch sections. Lastly, you may not graduate in 4 years don\u2019t worry it\u2019s more common than you think. Take a co-op/internship over missing one semester of school the experience is worth it.",

I personally think the CprE classes are a bit more organized and have better professors, but overall the professors are very good, TA\u2019s are very knowledgeable, the labs are beneficial. And honestly it\u2019s not too bad if you\u2019re good at math and enjoy doing the work.",

I graduated with my degree in EE so I can answer some questions around that if you have any, but ME diverges entirely in course material by the end of Yr 2\n\nEdit: I think I misread your post. I think the facilities offered to engineers are pretty solid and the quality of the courses is also pretty great. Hard to conceptualize it I guess, but my advice would be to engage with resources like tutoring services, SI, office hours, etc. and have professors know who you are. It will only benefit you",

Obviously we're just oddballs or something cause it seems most people are fine but I'll be honest I've only had a few professors here who were actually good (I have one semester left). They generally get better in the later classes but that's if you can get there. The early classes are brutal enough as is and then adding a bad professor on top doesn't help. It also didn't help that my advisor freshman year completely lied to me which ended up screwing me over later down the road forcing me to spend more time here. Idk what other schools you're looking at but I would suggest not going here. My sister's fiance Graduated from University of Iowa in EE and he seemed to like the program there",

I was told that while classes transferred from other colleges won't count towards my overall GPA that they will count towards the gpa for these groups. This isn't true at all and screwed me over cause I transferred a lot of my early classes and the few left I had here I struggled to get a 2.0 gpa in (eventually I got through it but it delayed me). I am also on my third advisor now so if you get a good one don't expect to have them forever cause everyone I know has had at least 2 advisors. \n\nMost of my professors were just bad at teaching, specifically the math professors (ended up transferring all of my math classes) and the statics professors (I know it's a hard class but the professor I had at a community college taught it so much better). Even this semester in my higher level classes, I still don't have professors who teach well (and one of them has an incredibly thick accent). If you worked really hard in high school and did super well then you might be ok but it'll definitely be a struggle. My friend who is a good bit smarter than me barely graduated on time and only really did graduate on time because he could make one of his classes pass/fail for the first semester of covid.",

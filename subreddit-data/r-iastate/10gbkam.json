    "postText": "Hey all! It seems like we always eventually circle back around to steam tunnel posts in this sub so I wanted to drop some information here for people who actually use the search function. I currently work on campus and have been through a lot of the steam tunnel system so my information is first-hand.\n\n***Are there motion sensors and alarms?*** Yes, and those alarms ring right into the DPS. Students have been caught and charged. FP&amp;M and the DPS would both appreciate people staying out of the tunnels unless they are with an employee who has authorization to be there.\n\n***Why can't we go into the tunnels?*** The tunnels were never meant for human comfort or convenience. Over the past few decades, lights and ventilation have been added to give the workers who have to go into the tunnels a safer working environment, but it is not a place you'd want to hang out. Also, those lights are not always on.\n\n***Are the tunnels dangerous?*** The University has taken steps to reduce the risk of injury to people in the tunnels but there is only so much you can do with old concrete tunnels. Structurally, most of the tunnels seem safe to me but there are a few that I try to get through quickly. Notice I didn't say that I \"walk\" through them quickly. Since these tunnels weren't built for convenience, there are a lot of areas where I can't stand up. Did I mention it's not a place you'd want to hang out? Some are only 3'x3' box culverts. A lot of the walls and ceilings are fine but there are areas that have concrete falling off. There used to be asbestos insulation on the steam pipes but that has been almost completely removed and replaced with safer options, but not 100%. Speaking of the steam pipes, they carry steam at around 95 psi. That's about 3 times the pressure of the air inside of a car tire. The steam is also around 335 degrees fahrenheit. The insulation can only stop so much heat from escaping which means the tunnels can get very warm.\n\n***Are the tunnels dirty?*** Yes. I would not recommend that anyone go into the tunnels in anything that can't be washed easily. There is at least *some* water standing in a lot of the tunnels. Generally it's not much but my boots are waterproof for a reason. The earliest tunnels were dug by hand with picks and shovels and then the walls were either brick or poured concrete. This is fine for keeping dirt out but unfortunately they can allow ground water to get in.\n\n***Can you go from building to building using the tunnels?*** No, not really. There are *some* buildings that have access doors to the tunnels, but not all. Given what I've already said about the conditions inside the tunnels, hopefully it's no surprise that I'd much rather walk above ground if I need to go somewhere.\n\n***Were the tunnels ever designed to be bomb shelters?*** No. I've heard a some interesting theories about the tunnels but unfortunately they were only designed to hold pipes. The tunnels weren't critical to the Manhattan project. There was never a tunnel system to get students around campus when it was cold. No secret tunnels exist to move hazardous chemicals or nuclear waste.\n\n***Are there monsters or ghosts in the tunnels?*** Maybe. I haven't seen anything worse than spiders and insects but you never know what's lurking around the next corner... My guess is no, there are no monsters or ghosts.\n\n***Why can't they just bury the steam pipes like water pipes?*** That's a great question! The short answer is that air is a very good thermal barrier. The windows in our homes generally have 2 or 3 glass layers that are separated by a small air gap. This greatly increases the insulating factor of the windows. The same is true for the steam pipes. ISU does have some steam pipes that are buried directly in the ground but those pipes are a small percentage of the total pipe and they have a lot of insulation around them. Also, steam pipes have a lot of valves, fittings, steam traps, etc. Repairing or replacing any of these items is much easier and less expensive if the pipe is accessible without using excavators and closing down roads. One thing that people also forget is that the ground has a lot of water. Water is very good at stealing heat from pipes. Pipes sitting in water is not a good situation when your goal is to transport heat around campus.\n\n***At the beginning, you said something about being in the tunnels with an authorized employee. Can we really do that without getting in trouble?*** Yes! Tours are given for several utilities systems including the power plant and the steam tunnels! You and up to 14 of your closest friends can all go at once! [Here is a link to a story about the tours and how to schedule one!](https://www.inside.iastate.edu/article/2022/07/21/tunnelguides) Since this article, Mike Murray has left ISU for a similar postion at another University so don't email him. Spoiler, you won't tour the entire steam tunnel system because that would take many hours and you would probably hate it after about 20 minutes. You will luckily be in a section that isn't super dirty and is tall enough to stand up in. If you do see monsters or ghosts, please report back.\n\n***EDIT:*** I also wanted to add that there is no WiFi in the tunnels and the chances of getting a cell signal are extremely small (you're underground...) so if you needed to call for help, it would be very difficult.",

We have tunnels too, and while I never got to go down into the tunnels when I was going to ISU, from your description here, they sound pretty similar to what we've got.  Dirty, cramped, old, and somewhat dangerous (we mostly have steam, chilled water, emergency power and communications lines running through ours).  I have only been down in them once, and that was once too many, lol!",

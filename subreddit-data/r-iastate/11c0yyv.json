    "postText": "Recently got admitted as CprE undergrad (international) n had a few questions:\n1. How good are the CprE courses? Are they challenging? What about CprE professors?\n2. What happens at the innovation centre?\n3. Describe the CprE, EE, SoftwareE, CyberSecE community and the best things abt being a part of that community.",

            "comment": "I'm currently in my second year as a CPR E student.\n\n1) The CPR E courses are generally fairly \"good\" in terms of content, and most of them are at least somewhat relevant to things you may do at a job in the future (I at least used knowledge from them at my internship).  The courses that I've taken were somewhat challenging, but are very passable with enough study time.  Be prepared to spend some quality time in the labs as well.  But the content is pretty manageable imo.  The professors range from fantastic to bad, but most of the professors I have had were at least decent.  There are plenty of resources online to help if you don't understand a professor too.\n\n2) The innovation center has some spaces for students to collaborate, some computer labs, and some club spaces.  It's a nice place to work on group projects.  I believe (although I haven't used them personally) they also have some equipment like 3D printers for fabricating stuff.\n\n3) Not sure what exactly you mean by \"community\", but most of my friends are in the department, so there's plenty of good people around to meet and interact with.  I'd recommend meeting some people to work on homework with too, it really helps if you struggle with a concept.\n\nHope this helps!",

    "postText": "I am an incoming freshman going into aerospace engineering. I was starting to prepare for college and wondering what kind of laptop I would need that would run all the necessary programs. I don't really know much about computers and specs so would anyone be able to tell me what kind of laptop worked for you? Slim and portable would be nice but it isn't a deal breaker. Also price isn't a super issue but I'd like to keep it like under $1000 if at all possible. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Just a general pro-tip: if you buy from the bookstore, you don\u2019t have to pay sales tax, plus get a four-year warranty. \n\nMy actual advise when buying a laptop is you get what you pay for. If you can afford it, buy something higher end now so you don\u2019t have to upgrade again until you\u2019re well done with school.  My personal preference for laptops is Apple (I\u2019m CprE so I can get away with it), Lenovo, and Dell (in that order). Get something with at least 16gb of memory, 1tb storage, i7, and a decent graphics card if you\u2019re planning on running CAD software.",

You'll be at the computer lab more often then not and will be kicking yourself for spending $1000+ on a laptop that's too heavy to take to class and functions like a PC thats not a PC... :)",

It runs solidworks decently and does great with matlab, just be realistic and know that it won\u2019t run heavy simulations fast (FEA, ANSYS, etc). For any heavy calculations needed, the vdi can be used.",

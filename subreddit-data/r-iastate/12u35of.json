You just have to make the effort.\n\nI moved to a single my second year and it was perfect. I\u2019d choose a single everytime.",

Students with single rooms tend to be less social but that\u2019s a generalization, you can have a single and still make plenty of friends. \n\nKind of up to you on what you want. If you need your space get a single. If you don\u2019t mind a roommate and want to open yourself up to more social opportunities get a double.",

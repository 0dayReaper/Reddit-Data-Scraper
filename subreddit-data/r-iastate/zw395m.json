Just wondering how manageable computer science might be as a double major.",

It is similar to to CS and it will be much easier/realistic to double major within the same college. If you are passionate about CS, you should still be able to find jobs. It\u2019s a career where it\u2019s more what you bring to the table than a degree or license. I know people who never went to college that work in CS.",

To even get interviews you\u2019ll need either strong internships at FAANG / unicorns or strong undergraduate research work. \n\nIf your curious on a typical resume, look up some quant trading interns on LinkedIn at top firms like citadel / Jane Street and see how stacked their resumes are and what colleges they go to. There\u2019s a reason those internships pay $120/hr.",

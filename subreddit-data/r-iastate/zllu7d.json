Talk to your advisor to make sure.\n\nIf you weren't in academic warning for *this* semester, you'll just go back into academic warning. Academic probation is only after a concurrent semester where you're on academic warning. \n\nBut as a heads up- if you do end up on academic probation, they'll withhold government loans and pell grant funds. So... try not to let that happen haha",

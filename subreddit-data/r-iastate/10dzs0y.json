    "postText": "So I just adopted a cat, and I need to take him for his first wellness exam. At the shelter they mentioned that sometimes some vets will waive the wellness exam fee for newly adopted pets. Are there any in Ames that do that? Also, he's my first cat, so some recommendations on the best vets in town would be nice. Thanks!!!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m not sure of any that waive the wellness exam. I always struggled to get into vet clinics in Ames, they tend to be very busy and more expensive than the surrounding area vets. \n\nMost of my coworkers go to Companion Animal Clinic in Gilbert or Somerset Veterinary Hospital. \n\nI took my puppy to ISU Vet Med Clinic and liked it but they closed down temporarily during COVID so I switched to Boone Veterinary Clinic to finish her vaccines and do her spay surgery. I\u2019ve been happy with Boone. Prices are reasonable and I\u2019ve been able to get same day or next appts when my dog is sick. Only weird thing is you have to request to see a vet when you make certain types of appointments otherwise you\u2019ll just get a vet tech.\n\nAvoid Ames Pet Hospital in west Ames. Really bad experience with them.",

I took her back everyday for 5 days to get subcutaneous fluids. On the fifth day our usual vet was out and the vet we saw said I should take her to ISU Vet Med\u2019s emergency department immediately. They had at no point over the past 5 days expressed concern about her condition or prognosis. They gladly charged over $1,000 in vet bills. \n\nISU Vet Med said she had advanced liver and kidney failure. And fluid around her heart and lungs which were making it hard for her to breathe and causing heart arrhythmia. All of this was news to me. Ames Pet Hospital had only said \u201cher liver values were a little high.\u201d We had to put her down a couple days later.",

The one we went to was Ames Pet Hospital. This was in the middle of the pandemic, so they were doing curbside so I really don\u2019t know how they are. Maybe try calling the shelter you adopted from and see if they have suggestions for the free first exam?\n\nI second Boone Vet hospital, it\u2019s where I take my cats now, but I know they do not waive the first exam fee. The doctors are amazing though!",

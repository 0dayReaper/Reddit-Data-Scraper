            "comment": "He was actually being really crazy rude earlier in the day, beyond just his preaching (and whatever, I may not agree with him, but it's technically his right. He was just being so rude about it).\n\nI'm in the Cantamus choir and we were doing a Monday Monologues performance (which has been scheduled for weeks, if not months), and he was continuing to shout over our performance for the *entire* time.\n\nThree of four different people went up to ask if he could stop or speak more quietly until we finished, because he was really really distracting for us and the people watching. Trying to sing and create a good atmosphere while he's shouting about hell isn't exactly easy.\n\nHe totally refused every single time tho. I believe he said he wasn't going to stop or be quieter because this \"was just his preacher voice\" and \"it's his right to say what he wants.\"\n\nI don't know what he thought he was gonna accomplish by shouting over us, because the entire crowd we gathered kept shooting him dirty looks (rightfully so tbh). \n\nIt's his right to say what he wants in that square, but that doesn't stop him from being a total dick to the performers there (who were scheduled a very long time ago). Could he not just be quiet and enjoy some music for 45 minutes? \ud83d\ude44",

Born again Christians are the most welcoming group of people I've ever known, and were the only ones there for me when I was in a very dark place in life.\n\nPeople like the yellers who are quick to condemn and bring shame may call themselves Christian, but they do not demonstrate the behavior that their alleged faith is supposed to be centered around.\n\nThe yellers are nothing but a caricature, a mockery of Christians, and every real Christian that I've ever known wants them to stop because real Christians get caught in the dragnet of an image that the yellers give off.\n\nDoes that mean born again Christians are perfect people?  No, it does not.  But real Christians are well aware of this.  (It would actually disprove Christian theology if they did become perfect, but that's a discussion for another day)  I've never seen any born again Christian speak in ways that are self righteous and overly pious like the yellers do.",

We can't forcibly make the yellers stop because they have first amendment protections.  They most closely mirror the pharisees or the false prophets from the scripture. They claim to be of faith and yet grace seems to be the last thing they want to talk about, and they are eager to condemn and demand perfection following condemnation, which is essentially the opposite of Christian theology, which is grace first, and the will to repent being the natural response to faith.  \n\nMy understanding is that yelling at nonbelievers to stop sinning is a fools errand.  It also alienates them, which is opposite to the mission of the church, so no born again Christian would partake in such behavior.\n\nAs for your statement in the first paragraph, I'm not sure we're treating the word represent the same, so that would create a disconnect in the discussion that I'm not particularly sure how to address, and so I think that particular topic of discussion has come to a dead end",

Personally, I have issues with St. Paul, but Jesus sure knows how to deal with people who are intent on ruining everyone's day. He talks to them. He listens to them, and then he helps them turn their attention to better work.",

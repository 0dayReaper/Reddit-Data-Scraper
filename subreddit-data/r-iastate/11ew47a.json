I don't think they curve, but you don't really need it tbh. There weren't any recitations but instead they had extra practice problems to do and everything was completely virtual besides the tests",

My calculus professor was absolutely phenomenal. Physics left a little to be desired but I still learned a lot. Most of the gen eds are very easy and lenient as well. Only 1 of these classes were online though, so I can't give you all the information you want, but I highly recommend doing some classes there if you want to keep it cheap and avoid the weed-out difficulty ISU makes some of the classes.\n\nEdit: EICC partners with ISU as well which makes transferring incredibly easy.",

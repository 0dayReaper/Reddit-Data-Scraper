I'm also American (I'm so sorry) so I was just wondering how many American students are attending. this could also be a general tips thread for any further newcomers who just happen to be on reddit.",

The difference being St Andrews is about a third American, with a lot of southern England rahs (red pants and endless jack wills, eesh) a bunch of scandos/germans, and like 5 scots, so I guess I was just wondering about how the different ratio would affect North Americans. I still argue with my friends from over there about aluminum/aluminium, pastel, oregano,pasta etc. I've got quite the strong southern accent which I'm sure will be hilarious to them. I've got a provisional to St. Chads as well. ",

I'm in one of the largest colleges in Durham and we only had 2 Americans come in this year. Granted, there were 10 Canadians... \nI'm willing to bet you will only meet a dozen or so Americans unless you actively seek them out.",

It doesn't matter hugely, because your college, alongside your course, will be where you meet people. But if there is someone else here from that College, they could give you specific advice!\n\n2. Get involved in things, College or Univesity. Once you've done this, I don't think you'll need any more advice here.\nPretty general advice, but there is a lot of stuff going on in Durham! My College rugby team really helped me immerse myself in Durham, and the Athletics setup helped me get out of college and meeting new people. There is just a massive amount going on here, so it won't be difficult at all.\n\n3. In my College at least, there are big events early in the year for foreign students. You can't miss them, and that is where you'll meet other foreign students.\n\n4. Look forward to it. Because of the College system and the relatively good work ethic, it is easy to make friends and people like doing things. You've made a great choice. \n\n5. Klute is a strange yet enchanting place. Enjoy.",

I've heard about the mysterious Klute. I think I'll be in Chads but that may change as the summer progresses. How are the weightlifting gyms? I'm pretty worried that they won't be up to par due to the size of the school and I'll have nothing but pink dumbbells and ellipticals to work with.",

I don't know about Chads, but the college gyms are not usually that well equipped. However, for a small termly free (\u00a3100 I think) you can get a membership at Maiden Castle Gym which has a good setup. ",

I can't be bothered worrying about how good or bad the sports teams are, just having a good time is enough, I suck at soccer anyway and can't play rugby because I've been institutionalized by American football.",

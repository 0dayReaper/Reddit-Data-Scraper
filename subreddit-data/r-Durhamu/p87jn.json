    "postText": "email received: http://i.imgur.com/D4ZxG.png I mainly skeptical about a 2.5 hour class to be able to fully read 1000 word/min with full comprehension. It is sent by a member of Durham university staff. Its from a place called www.cambridgeperformance.com With Cambridge uni pics on their website, but they are not related to Cambridge (in contact us their address is in Oxford). If it is legit I am would be interested but it smells to me like a scam.",

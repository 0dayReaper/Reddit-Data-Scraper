I've also never heard of anyone getting told off for anything.\n\nI don't think they say you can't watch porn do they? Seems a bit harsh as almost everyone is an adult, unless you're watching it in the library or something...",

I also like the bit about requesting written consent, I wonder if anyone has asked their permission to watch porn?\n\nAs for the movies thing, you're right in that if they were going to crack down on anything it would be that but I still don't think they care too much. Maybe if you went overboard on it but I've been here 4 years and haven't heard of one person being even slapped on the wrist...",

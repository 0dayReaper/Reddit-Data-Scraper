    "postText": "Quick summarised post (\"On my study break\")...\n\nThe idea is to have a creative week, 10-15 Junes which involves as many Durham societies/groups as possible (both official/ratified and unofficial). An event roster will be organised with societies putting on events for their members as well as visiting members.\n\nThere will be an exhibition/party and after-party (put on by the DJ society and possibly other Durham groups like Nova, Durham University Records, etc).\n\nSo far the Art Soc, Design Soc, DJ Soc and DUMake group are in. Planning will properly kick off from 29 June although those who finish earlier will be able to get things rolling.\n\nI have rushed through this post so if there's anything I could do with clarifying please let me know. There is a [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/469207609822165/) which you can request to join if you are an exec of a Durham group/society.",

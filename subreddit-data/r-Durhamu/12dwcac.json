    "postText": "Hi, I'm one of the founders of a Manchester based start-up called Candle (www.candleapp.io). Based on our own experiences with anxiety and other issues, we built Candle app, which is focused on making it easy to ask for mental health support from your peers when you need it. With just a few taps of our app it sends an alert to your chosen supporters letting them know that you need a conversation, bringing the help to you. We also give you and your supporters education on giving effective support to each other.\n\nWe've just launched our public version and are starting to share it with university groups, unions and societies.  \n\nIf you're interested to learn more you can sign-up at https://www.candleapp.io/public-signup\n\nThank you if you read this far! Any feedback or sign-ups greatly appreciated. We made Candle because we want to actually make a real difference - the more feedback we gather, the better we can make the support experience.\n\nI couldn't see a rule against this type of post, but apologies in advance if I missed it.",

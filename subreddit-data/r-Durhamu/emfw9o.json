    "postText": "We're a team of students who have recently developed an application that lets students rideshare and in-turn reduce the costs for everyone. It also means that drivers will get paid in some fuel contribution. The app is free to download and there's no subscriptions or anything. This isn't BS! We're only just getting started, but any and all support is appreciated as we bootstrap our way to providing the cheapest travel alternative for students across the UK.\n\nhttp://www.letspool.co.uk",

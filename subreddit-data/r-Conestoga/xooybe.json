    "postText": "My program is Healthcare Administration and service management. I registered for online classes for September 2022 intake but after attending classes for a few days my visa got refused. I sent my deferral request on 8th September &amp; still waiting for my new LOA. But I\u2019m still registered for my online classes &amp; get updates &amp; materials. \nMy question is - \n1) while I\u2019m waiting for my new letter of acceptance from college. Should I keep attending the online classes or not ? Will it make any difference? \nI\u2019ve missed a lot of classes since my visa got refused.I want to start fresh from January 2023.\n2) How do I unregister from my online classes now. \nPlease help; this is stressing me out \ud83d\ude23",

            "comment": "In general it is good advice to mail international office or your program coordinator regarding such questions. You can find their contact info on Conestoga website. \n\nBut from my best guess I think that it should be possible to start afresh if your reapplied visa acceptance is delayed. The problem is the college requires valid reasoning for deferral. So in case your visa reapplication gets a fast response, college may not allow deferral. For that reason it is adviced to attend lectures and submit whatever submissions on time. Another thing to note is that if the next batch seats are full you may not get admitted to that batch either &amp; may have to further wait for the batch after. And to complicate this, there was a policy of withdrawal of fees (I don't know if it still exists) having limited time frame. This withdrawal also required valid reasoning.\n\nSo you should research and plan all this out in a systematic way to minimise the confusion/loss of your education/money/etc",

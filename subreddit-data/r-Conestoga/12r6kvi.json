    "postText": "Hey fellow students! \n\nI\u2019ll be attending 1st year RT program for the fall semester but I have a pre-booked trip from Sep 7-15th. From my understanding, I\u2019ll still be meeting peers and seeing the faculty during orientation but I\u2019ll be missing the first week of classes (4 courses). I\u2019m seeking opinions on whether I should take this opportunity and go on this trip or cancel it and go to classes. Would I be missing a lot if I do miss the first week of classes?",

Others will be doing so and, if there's a lot of groupwork in your program, you don't want to be having to improvise on your group members. Remember: the most important thing in groupwork is knowing who NOT to work with.",

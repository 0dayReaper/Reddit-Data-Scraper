Does this affect my visa or study permit?\n\nI would like some advice and suggestions from people who have been in a similar position or know anything about it.",

But if you want to apply for extension it might be problematic. Best course of action is to mail college advisors and international offices. They'll know the specifics and help you out",

At the very least they can explain your situation to you with more in-depth details and they may even have another option for you such as summer school or a \"camp\" for gaining the remaining percentage needed to pass as some colleges do in Ontario. The best you can do is talk to you director hope it helps and good luck do not give up!! My sister dropped out because she screwed up her schedule and failed a couple courses, come to find out she had options for make up to pass the course she just never spoke to her teachers or director.",

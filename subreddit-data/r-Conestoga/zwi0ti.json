    "postText": "So I'm planning for the Web Development course at Conestoga for Jan -24 intake. I had some doubts regarding it and was hoping you all could help me in clearing them. \n\n1. Is the course really 2 years or is it less than that? I mean do I get 3 year PGWP after the course? \n\n2. How are the job opportunities after the course? \n\n3. Do we get any breaks between the semesters or is it back to back semesters? \n\nI went through the sub regarding the web dev course but mostly the info is either out dated or not what I'm looking for. \n\nTIA",

            "comment": "Myself as a web developer with around 3 years of experience in India, I thought about this course and researched every bit of it but didn't opt for it. I think I can answer your questions, so here you go:\n\n1) The program has no semester break, it's a 16 month back to back program.(One of my major reasons to reject it).\n\n\n2) Program doesn't have a co-op option, which i think is a downside of not getting a proper training about job market.\n\n\n3) Ofcourse you'll get a lot of job opportunities but the programs which make you ready for market are the one which have co-op.\n\n\n4) You'll get a 3 year pgwp as it's a 4 semester program.\n\n\n\nIn the end it's a great program but depends on individual to individual and their priorities, I'll suggest you to go for a 1+1 and you can go for Computer application development (CAD) program with optional co-op to start with it as its curriculum is almost same as this one. And you'll have the time to decide and select your second course after reaching and exploring the Canadian job market.\n\nHope I've cleared the doubts.",

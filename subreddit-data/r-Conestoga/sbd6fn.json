They made a post on the 21st; [Province endorses Conestoga\u2019s masking protocol](http://blogs1.conestogac.on.ca/news/2022/01/province_endorses_conestogas_m.php). So the goal is you go back to all classes on your timetable labelled in person. When you get there, you have to complete pre-screening, then are given a 3 layer mask that you MUST wear(they also update [FAQ about N95](https://www.conestogac.on.ca/covid-19/faq), saying that you must remove it and put on 3 layer mask given).",

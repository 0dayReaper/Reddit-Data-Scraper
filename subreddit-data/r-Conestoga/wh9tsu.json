    "postText": "Hello, I'm going into my third semester this fall, I have paid my fees and I am still listed as not registered in the financial section of my student portal. I have confirmed my invoices, and paid my deposit, as well as clarifying that I'm using OSAP for my tuition fees. I'm just scared I will be not able to take my third semester and have just wasted money/time. Any clarification I can get will be greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit: I also just emailed my program coordinator to see if he can help me at all. Thanks for any other help someone might have to offer, I'm in summer classes and finals anxiety got me going a little crazy.",

Check your \u201cMy courses\u201d section and check \u201cProgram Progress\u201d and see if there are blue arrows on the courses you are supposed to take this fall that say \u201cIn progress fall 2022\u201d when hovered over. If it says that, your registered.",

Check that out. If not contact student fees and maybe your program coordinator to get everything figured out. A lot of people seems to be struggling with OSAP right now.",

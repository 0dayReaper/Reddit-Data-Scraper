Basically they workout deals with Unis to accept, some needed an extra prep course and the guidance counselors should be able to tell you all that. \n\nNot sure why your want your masters, but if your into dev, masters doesn't help in a lot of jobs, but does in some. All depends on what your looking to do with your degrees. I wouldn't recommend getting a master just for the sake of getting a masters",

There are some universities in Canada that will accept a 3-year degree for masters programs, so you should look into those instead, like [York](https://futurestudents.yorku.ca/graduate/programs) and I think UofT for some masters programs.",

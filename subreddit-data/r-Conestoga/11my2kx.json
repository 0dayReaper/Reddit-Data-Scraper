Some of the big companies won't recruit at all - don't expect to get recruited into most consulting or capital markets jobs.\n\nThat said, once you get established nobody really cares.",

One of them networked me a management job in accounting within a few months of graduating.  They really are important to finding work...many of my cohorts also had similar experiences with their coop jobs leading to full time employment in good careers.",

It depends - some larger firms care (like if you're going into Accounting you likely won't get hired straight out of school from one of the big 4), but others don't. I was given interviews from Sunlife and other small local accounting firms. If you're in Accounting, CRA loves recruiting Conestoga BBA Accounting students (20 people from my class got recruited there).",

I personally beat out people from UWaterloo, Laurier, Guelph for the one coveted co-op position during the program.  I had programming experience (work experience) on top of the program which helped.  Work harder than them and its yours.  \n\nMore than 65 percent are CPAs, some have done their MBA (no additional schooling needed between the BBA and MBA).  \n\nA lot went to the big firms (Deloitte, KPMG, E&amp;Y, BDO, MNP).  Some are managers and junior partners.  Others burnt out.\n\nThe rest are running accounting departments, working at tech firms, CRA, banking (including managing), investing, insurance, one is running a department for ultrawealthy client investments.  A bunch were seeking out auditing careers after as well.",

Let  this be a life lesson, do not accept anything less than what is fair  treatment. The university has been withholding information and not  taking action, they have failed you. People are saying that this virus  isn't a big deal because the elderly are expendable. The elderly are  expendable? The elderly cared for us, they carry our wisdom, if we as a  society can't protect them, then in my books, our society simply put,  has failed\"\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/fhnc98/richard\\_mann\\_is\\_a\\_based\\_legend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/fhnc98/richard_mann_is_a_based_legend/)",

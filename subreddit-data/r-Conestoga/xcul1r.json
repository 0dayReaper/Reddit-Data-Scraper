    "postText": "Hi, I am in my 5th year in High school. I'm planning to go to Conestoga for Aviation. I heard it is better than the University of Waterloo since it's cheaper and easier to get into.  Therefore I would like to know more about the program and also I'm not really sure about my second option. At the moment it is Water resources Engineering at the University of Guelph.",

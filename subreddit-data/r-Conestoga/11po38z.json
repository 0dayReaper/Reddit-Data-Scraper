I think powerline grads aren't likely to be on Reddit since they're basically all working FT out of the program. (Some are drafted before they even finish the program, it's cray.)

Having those coop placements go along way when a company is thinking about hiring. Think of it as a 4 month job interview x2 if you get a placement with the same company the second time.",

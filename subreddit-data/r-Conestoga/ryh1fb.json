    "postText": "We've had a few people post questions about how to view their schedule here and I thought I would help clarify the process.\n\nFirst of all, despite this being poor practice in web development, your schedule is displayed as a popup which means that (for most browsers) you will have to add an exception to your browser's popup blocker for [conestogac.on.ca](https://conestogac.on.ca). To do so see the following links:\n\n*  [Block or allow pop-ups in Chrome - Computer - Google Chrome Help](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95472) \n*  [Allow or block pop-ups in Safari on Mac - Apple Support (CA)](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/safari/sfri40696/mac) \n*  [Pop-up blocker settings, exceptions and troubleshooting | Firefox Help (mozilla.org)](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/pop-blocker-settings-exceptions-troubleshooting) \n\n Once that's done you can view your schedule by doing the following:\n\n1. Visit [https://www.conestogac.on.ca/](https://www.conestogac.on.ca/)\n2. Select Login &gt; Student Portal\n3. Sign in\n4. Select \"Calendar\"\n5. Select: \"Session: Winter 2022\" from the dropdown menu\n6. Select: \"Week: 2022-01-09 - 2022-01-15\" from the second dropdown menu\n7. Click \"Display Timetable\"\n8. Your timetable will be displayed in a new tab\n\nHope this helps.",

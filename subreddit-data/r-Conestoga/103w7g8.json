    "postText": "Hello all! I know it has been discussed on the sub, but I really need some advice here.\nI\u2019m an international student and have received offer of CPA(computer programming and analysis) in 23fall which will expire in three days. I searched here and found that everyone thought SET(software engineering technology) is better. I cannot apply for SET unless decline the current offer. And I\u2019m not sure whether I could get the offer of SET.\n\nGiven the little time left for me,could u give me some advice? \n\nBTW I saw the analogy of building house on the sub,and that\u2019s why I want to apply for SET. For someone like me with zero CS background, it seems better to choose SET to have a solid foundation?",

            "comment": "I\u2019m in SET so I might be a bit more biased but I do think it\u2019s a slightly better program, however, I would not take the chances of declining the CPA offer and then not being accepted into SET. I\u2019d say stick with your CPA offer. \n\nI believe CPA also has like 12-14 month co-op I think? After your co-op experience, if you manage to get into it, you more marketable then someone who did SET without co-op by a long shot. Getting experience is most important and matters more than what program youre in. CPA and SET students a lot of the time share the same co-op placements too.",

I think the minimum cut off is an average around low 80's 1st year average. If you're average % after first year is in the 80's or higher than you probably have a good chance.",

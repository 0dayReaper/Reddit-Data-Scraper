            "comment": "My complaint involves people waiting for a bus at Door #4, right between A-wing and B-wing, sort of like the main entrance to Conestoga.\n\n...you're waiting for the bus? Cool. Move AWAY FROM THE ENTRANCE TO THE COLLEGE PLEASE. There are four doors for entry; there should be NO ONE standing in front, within, or blocking of ANY of them. Are you vampires afraid of the sun? Line up against the school wall, please. What the fucking fuck. Why am I walking around a bunch of people to get through the frontiest front mainest main entrance of the college? Look AROUND you. I think your conversation is cool too, just walk a couple feet over there. I take the bus too, 7 or 8 times a week. I don't stand right in front of the doors to the school.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't be surprised, I have seen the smirking line-cutting culture that blows up waiting for the 116. Maybe acting like a sociopathic cactus pays off in terms of getting somewhere to put your butt for the next 20 minutes.\n\nI wish people looked at walking (which often becomes standing when the spirit just does not move you) as similar to driving, with lanes... I don't even drive! I just don't bottleneck the shit out of paths through the environment I am honestly grateful for. I like my education and my program. Also, folks in the wheelchair, you can park that shit anywhere you want friend, that's not what I'm talking about.",

I applied to the program with a 97 avg from hs (including the 10% boost for U courses) and Im worried that my portfolio isn't strong enough to get in. What experiences did you have in your portfolio and video submission? When did you receive your acceptance?  Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions!",

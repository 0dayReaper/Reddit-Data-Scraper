    "postText": "*(Software Engineering Technology)*  \nI've heard many great things about the SET program at Conestoga, but with uWaterloo just down the road, it seems like SET graduates would be in the shadow of those graduating from UW in terms employability and skillset. Is this true? \n\nDo local employers prefer uni grads when it comes to coop placement and employment? Are SET graduates recognized as and capable of becoming competent developers able to work on the same interesting and challenging projects that any other aspiring developer would? What are the major pros and cons of each of these two pathways?\n\nI know a lot of this depends on the individual, but individual differences aside, many job postings state that a degree is required; is the SET graduate able to break into the industry despite this supposed obstacle?\n\nThanks so much for any insight!!  \nMind my skeptical tone, just trying to clear up any potential misconceptions.",

What the faculty in SET, and the alumni, say is that job requirements are just a wishlist. If you're the most competent applicant with a college diploma, you'll still sometimes get chosen over uni grads. I say sometimes, because there are some companies (eg. Google) who legitimately won't even look at co-ops/grads who have no degree. That said, most of the companies in KW recognize the talent in SET.",

Everywhere I read, Python, JS, and Java are the most popular languages of the day--are these touched upon? Or is the approach rather to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to pick up those or other languages fairly quickly if need be? Thanks again Carlo :)",

So, we don't actually teach Python but students use it anyway (because you can easily pick it up). We do use JS but, again, it's easily picked up.  We used to have an entire course in Java but we didn't really need it (because ... it's easy to pick up) so we got rid of that course.  It's still used for Android programming but there's no need to teach it.  So, yes, you can pick up anything after you're done Year 1.",

    "postText": "Hi, I am looking for some advice from someone who has had a similar experience in the rpn program. \n\nI have failed one class during first semester and when I re took it, I passed. \n\nI am now in semester 2 and I think I might fail 2 courses. It may just be one but I\u2019m not for sure yet. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m eligible for supplemental exams either\u2026\n\nI was wondering if anyone knows if having failed a course in the first semester and failing 2 in the second semester means I will be kicked out of the program. I read in the program handbook that you can only have a maximum of 2 fails in the whole program and only 1 fail during a semester. \n\nI\u2019m very worried that I will be on academic probation or that I will be kicked out of the program. \nAny input will help :)\n\nThanks!",

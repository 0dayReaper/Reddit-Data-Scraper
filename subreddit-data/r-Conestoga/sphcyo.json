A lot of internships at larger companies REQUIRE you are pursuing a bachelors degree. Internships are vital in launching your career so why limit your choices? especially if it\u2019s at a larger, more prestigious company. BUT when it comes to landing a job, bachelors degree vs diploma won\u2019t matter as you now see self-taught devs with no formal education getting into companies like Google. \n\nThere is no downside in going for the bachelors unless you have a specific situation where going into the 3 year program makes more sense for you. \n\n(If you take co-op in the 3 year program the total program length goes to 4 years so timing would still be the same as bachelors route.",

It includes a double-sided page with some of the employers who have employed our Co-ops and Alumni.  In my opinion, the only big name company who hasn't employed one of our students is Facebook.",

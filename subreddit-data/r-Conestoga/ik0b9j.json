            "comment": "I took Pre-health last year and was able to get into the Practical Nursing program right after. I\u2019m on my second semester of the practical nursing program and so far it\u2019s been pretty great. \n\nPre-health is worth taking for so many reasons! I had to take it to get accepted into RPN but was honestly really grateful that I had to take it. The 2 semesters worth of content gives you a really good refresher for whats to come in RPN. In the first semester of RPN I noticed that students who\u2019ve taken Pre-health had a bit of an upper hand, especially when it came to anatomy and physiology! \n\nEnjoy the program, it\u2019ll go by fast! Also the better marks you get, the better chances you have of getting into RPN. It\u2019s a highly competitive program so make sure to keep up with Pre-health. All the best!",

As difficult as they are the content is really interesting and if you\u2019re excited to become a nurse, then you\u2019ll find it all very interesting too! Teachers are great so far.",

            "comment": "Careful about going into the nursing program if we are still in a pandemic! I was in the nursing program during the beginning of the pandemic and it is brutal. Nursing school is hard on its own, add a pandemic, extreme. Many students are having to drop out or take a stress/mental health leave of absence. My class was doing semester 2 and 3 placements at the same time because semester 2 was never finished and had to shut down back in March. Another downside is that hands on learning will be extremely limited. Not sure about you but I wouldn't trust a student nursing that has practiced catheterization on nothing more than a paper cup. Or injecting an IV into a piece of celery. ( yes these are actually things we have done and was the only practice we got) \nI am not trying to scare you off, nursing is amazing! Just please be aware of what the program is like now during the pandemic",

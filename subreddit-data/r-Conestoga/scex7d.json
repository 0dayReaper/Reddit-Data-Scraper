The teacher teaches, we do things on our own computers.  In person for my program is a huge waste of time and money.\n\nI don't want to have to drive 1h each way, pay for gas or parking when I can just do the exact same thing from my bed or kitchen.  Currently, the risk of COVID is the big worry, but even if COVID suddenly disappeared tomorrow I wouldn't want to go back.",

A return to in person learning for me is a lot of risk for no academic benefit.\n\nIt's definitely being ~~done to appease teachers who don't like teaching online~~ and to keep international student money flowing.\n\nEdit: As it turns out they're not consulting with teachers :/",

I feel like the college is rushing things without proper plans, and the month by month approach to the question \u201care we returning?\u201d has really tired me out. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019ve become very cynical of the college over the past year or so, mainly due to how poorly the issue of re-opening has been communicated. That and the lack of consultation on the topic with the student body. It\u2019s tiring, and the ultra corporate structure and endless growth that Tibbits is imposing is making this place feel very exclusionary towards students.",

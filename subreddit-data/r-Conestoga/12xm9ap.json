    "postText": "Hi! \n\nI am (was) currently at the conestoga college or trades. \n\nTo make this short, I wanted to drop COM1085. I am fairly certain I filled out the correct form, not the form for dropping the whole program. \n\nI've already contacted my program coordinator and sent an email to admissions. My section is currently on a small break as we just finished term 1. \n\nHas anyone dealt with this before? I'm trying to get back in before the start of term 2. \n\nAny advice?",

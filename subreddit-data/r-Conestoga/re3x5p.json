The only thing you can try to control is taking courses that are delivered to your preference. \n\nIts gotta be really hard to facilitate a class that is both taught online and in person.",

You have time for your jobs, you can watch the class from anywhere but some might not. \nActually, it depends on programs too. For some, online learning works even if they do not attend a single class in-person but for some, practical learning is a must otherwise they wouldn't be able to cope up once they go out in the industry.",

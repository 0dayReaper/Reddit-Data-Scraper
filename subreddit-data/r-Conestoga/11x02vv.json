No excuse for that as it's critical. I would also say there is a lot more Macs out there now so learn both... the last two companies I was with were 80% mac... load parallels on your Mac or dual boot it.",

Sure there is more work involved than strictly sticking with one operating system but you shouldn't limit yourself to just Windows as when applying to jobs it is good to be \"agile\".\n\nIf you have the ability to swap to a Windows computer now assuming you'll be using Visual studio and Microsoft SQL, then it may be best to take that approach however depending on your program you can get away with using a MacBook as well, it will just involve a bit more work and versatility on your end.",

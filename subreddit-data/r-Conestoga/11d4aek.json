    "postText": "I am a 20 y.o international student. This year will be my first time filing for taxes. I have not worked at all this or the year before, but I would like to transfer some of my tuition credit to next year when I will graduate and start working hopefully.   \nUpon reading other reddit post, I believe anyone over the age of 19 is eligible for a GST tax credit. Is this also applicable for international student? Also can I also file my 2021 tax to receive that GST tax credit?  \nThank you :)",

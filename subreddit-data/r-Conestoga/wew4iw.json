    "postText": "So I'm a second-year student who slacked off looking at housing and now I'm super close to my lease expiring and have not found housing for September yet. I have noticed that a lot of other people are in the same boat as me and looking for housing as a group is obviously better as most renters are more eager to sign group leases or at least that's what I've heard. So, if you're looking for housing and want to look together, shoot me a pm.",

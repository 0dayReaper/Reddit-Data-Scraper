    "postText": " Hi everyone! I recently got an offer for Project Management (Jan 2024 intake) at Conestoga College - Doon campus.\n\nHowever, I'm thinking about switching campuses from Doon to the campus in Downtown. Asides from the tuition fee, I'm also considering the following:\n\n* which has more culture and life? both in campus and the city?\n* which location will more likely have more job opportunities (full-time or part-time)?\n* cheaper cost of living? more chances of finding rooms with a budget?\n* which campus offers the best student services?\n* which campus will be a better environment for taking up Project Management?\n\nI know my considerations won't lean towards only one campus, but I'd just like to gather enough information so I can weigh my options based on actual facts and the experiences of people here.\n\nI'd like to appreciate and thank everyone for their comments and opinions in advance. It'll mean so much to an international student like me who is in the middle of planning and preparing \ud83d\ude4f\ud83e\udd70",

Doon is at the very edge of the city and there aren't a lot of job opportunities around it.\n3. Downtown will be more expensive, but you are also surrounded by more shops and will have more job prospects. it's also easier to get around the city living downtown than living near doon. That being said, the rental market here is an expensive mess in general unless you're rooming with multiple people so ymmv.\n4. Doon by far has the best student services. Being the largest campus means almost all of the school's amenities are located here.\n5. unfortunately I can't help you with this one as I'm not in that program, but I hope my other answers help a bit!",

But if you really want to make connections, downtown is the place I'll prefer. It's a relatively small campus compared to doon so you make friends easily as you basically see them every other day. I have made so many new friends from other courses in dtk campus in just 2 months. But yeah, all my friends love doon campus more, no idea why. I love DTK. I am the odd one out I guess \ud83d\ude05\n\nBut yes, there is a huge scarcity of jobs in kitchener. 99% of the students in my class as well as other courses don't have a job till now. If you live around doon/Cambridge, there are a lot of factories there so might have some luck related to jobs. \n\nThere is a whole life when you step out of dtk campus as it is situated right in the middle of downtown. Whereas doon is just..doon. Whatever the life you'll have, it will be on-campus only. No life outside the campus area.",

In doon, you would find students of various nationalities while in DTK, majority are Indians and some are from Nigeria. My friends like doon better because of the bigger campus and diversity there. \n\nProject management is okayish. I feel like it's very different than what I imagined it to be. More bookish knowledge and not much that you can apply in real settings. Some subjects are tough while others are a breeze. But somewhere my classmates and I feel that there is not much that we have learned to be honest. I do not want to discourage you, just want to be honest. Do not keep your hopes too high. I am hoping the second semester to be a little bit better!",

    "postText": "I started the SET program in September 2021 and finish April 2023. If you don't want to read through the next couple paragraphs, I wouldn't recommend SET for someone wanting to pursue a career in IT / software development. This is due to the progressively lower course quality as the program advances from level 1 to level 4 and lack of professor engagement. Anyways, before you make the big decision on whether you want to spend the next 2-3 years pursuing SET Software Engineering Technician or Software Engineering Technology (Co-op) program let's go through the courses you\u2019ll take.\n\n**Level 1:**\n\n**C/C++ Programming:** Overall, this course was great. You dive deep into low level programming in the C language. You learn programming from scratch, specifically topics such as variables, data types, control flows, functions, I/Os, pointers, and more. Since level 1 was online (during the pandemic), the professor recorded many of the lectures. He had lab sections to clarify questions, however having live online classes would have made the course a lot better. **Overall course experience: 4/5**\n\n**Operating System Fundamentals:** Fantastic course! In OSF, you work with the windows operating system learning how to work on the command line, automate scripts using batch files, and use virtual machines. The professor for this course was extremely knowledgeable about the content and went above and beyond to make sure students understood the content. He was hired on contract, but he should have been hired full time because he was one of the best professors I had in the program. **Overall course experience: 4.5/5**\n\n**User Interface Fundamentals:** This was a fun one! You learn about how to create an effective interface and what goes into the planning for awesome visuals and design choices in websites. This course had no coding involved; however, you'll use figma and wireframe tools to do the assignments. Awesome course for people interested in UI design and front-end development. **Overall course experience: 4/5**\n\n**Software Engineering Fundamentals:** Super important course! If it was any other prof, it would have been boring but luckily, we got a professor that was fun yet knowledge about the field of software development. In this course, we learned about requirements gathering, debugging, testing, and how to effectively design software systems. It created a good basis for realizing that software development isn't just about coding, but it also requires understanding of the system being created, and how to debug and test. **Overall course experience: 4/5**\n\n**Level 1 \u2013 16.5/20** You'll learn a lot this term and the professors will be more likely to help you out in case you have questions about the material. The workload is manageable, and you could even do a part time job as long as you\u2019re on top of the course topics and assignments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's now go to level 2, a huge leap from level 1 where you'll build off what you learned in C/C++ programming, OSF, and SEF.\n\n**Data Structures:** Mediocre course. Since you've learned C, you won't be intimidated of coding, however data structure a first tend to be challenging to understand. Assignments were especially difficult because the data structures topics weren't presented well. This included: Linked lists, double linked lists, hash tables, binary trees, and time complexities (that is only briefly touched on). Online tutorials to make sense data structures will be your best friend and some of the examples the prof provides are good is enough for you to do the assignments. **Overall course experience: 3/5**\n\n**Object Oriented Programming:** Super important and interesting course! You'll learn how organize your code (variables, functions) in objects. This course teaches several important concepts such as accessors, get/set, mutators, and the (4) pillars of OOP. The assignments are tricky, however with enough focus and revision of the examples you can do well. **Overall course experience: 4/5**\n\n**System Analysis and Design:** Decent course. You'll learn some useful concepts in this course such as designing database schemas, entity relationship diagrams, and Software Development Life Cycle. Creating the diagrams was a bit tedious, however was an interesting way to conceptualize how to design a database and software systems. At times the course was very boring, however working with your friends on some of the assignments will save you from having to do the sometimes less fun assignments by yourself. **Overall course experience: 3.5/5**\n\n**Cyber Security:** Awful course. Going into this course, I was interested in learning about cyber security however the content was terrible. Firstly, the professor was awful. We hadn't seen her once throughout the course and she never (and I mean NEVER) answered our emails. Also, I questioned why I paid tuition for this course when all the material were links to DEF CON YouTube videos. Bad course, hated it! **Overall course experience: 0/5**\n\n**Computer Architecture and Machine Language:** Another awful course. Below the C language there is assembly language and machine code. Knowing how much C helped in understanding other programming languages I was excited for this course until we got a professor that did not know anything! It was shocking to see that the program hired a professor that would ask students on how to run the IDE during class. Of course, everyone makes mistakes however it was his lack of preparation and the programs disregard for giving someone that knows the content that made this course very difficult. I even remember asking him a question on how to do an assignment. They replied, \u201cwrite the code in C language and use an online tool to convert it to assembly.\u201d This was a testament to a lack of knowledge of the course material. **Overall course experience: 0.5/5**\n\n**Level 2 \u2013 11/25** Cyber security and computer architecture really killed it for me. It was super frustrating that I was paying tuition and using my time for courses that were poorly organized and professor's that didn't know the material, OR couldn't respond to emails...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLevel 3 - I would say this was the most difficult semester of the program due to workload.\n\n**Windows Programming:** Good course! In this course, you'll deep dive into C# and the .NET framework. The course is rather interesting because the assignments you do touch on a lot of old concepts you learn such as OOP and data structures and will introduce new concepts such as threads, sockets, and various communication protocols. The assignments are open ended giving you a lot of creativity on how you want to approach, design, and execute them. The professor for this course was knowledgeable about the course content and responded to emails fast! **Overall course experience: 4/5**\n\n**Web Development and Technologies:** Not too good, again terrible professor (same guy from computer architecture). In this course, you'll learn HTML, JavaScript, Jquery, HTTP/HTTPs, and how the internet works. The concepts are easy enough for you to understand on your own, however the professor lacked knowledge on how to answer students\u2019 questions made the assignments harder than they should have been. The slides enough will be good to cover the materials of the course, however it sucked that the professor couldn't answer a lot of the questions which later shot many students in the foot when it came to doing the assignments. **Overall course experience: 2 /5**\n\n**Embedded Systems:** Challenging course! In this course, you'll be working with ARM assembly code and using it to program a hard device called the STM32. The professor was very helpful and knowledgeable about assembly; however I believe many students struggled or failed this course was due to the terrible experience they had in computer architecture and machine language in level 2. Also, assembly requires a different thought process in coding as data management is crucial to ensuring that the program works successfully. If your interested in low level / hardware programming you may like this course, otherwise it is just another course your going to want to pass. **Overall course experience: 3/5**\n\n**Software Quality:** Awesome course! The professor was super kind and friendly. In this course, you'll learn about Agile, SCRUM, and how software projects are executed. At the end, you'll combine your knowledge of windows programming C# and .NET to create a transportation management application. This was the highlight of the program for me. You'll learn so much and feel like a developer building a project from the ground up. Also, you'll get to present your project to the class with your group and see how other groups approached the project. **Overall course experience: 4.5/5**\n\n**Relational Databases:** Meh! This course is a bit of a drag. It spends way too much time reviewing concepts from system analysis and design and less time on SQL. You'll learn the SQL language and its syntax, however spending way too much time on schema designs took away from other things we could have learned. **Overall course experience: 2.5/5**\n\n**Level 3 - 16/25** Don't work part time during this semester its a lot of work! Also, for the most part, the courses are decent. Apart from web development and relational database I learned quite a bit. Also, knowing most people that go through this program (asking many class fellows of mine), many don't want to work in embedded systems so that course felt redundant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow we enter level 4 - the final semester for students in the Software Engineering Technician program. The worst semester of the program in terms of what you'll learn and the professors you'll have.\n\n**Advanced Cyber Security:** Awful course. Again, I was excited to learn about cyber security however 70% of the course was just the professor explaining how to install the software (sometimes he couldn\u2019t even figure out how to do it). He wasn't very responsive to emails, and we hadn't got marks back until 1-2 months of submission. Overall, not a good course. **Overall course experience: 0.5/5**\n\n**Network Application Development:** Awful course. In this course, you learn a lot of things such as APIs, client to server, and communication protocols. Yes, you do learn a fair bit, however a lot of the assignments involve watching online tutorials or modifying existing code from github repositories. Also, at times my professor wouldn't answer emails for like a week making it hard to complete the assignments. This was the feedback I got from my class fellows as well. **Overall course experience: 2/5**\n\n**Mobile Application Development:** Good course! Here, you'll work in Java and Android studio to develop android applications. It was a pretty good course, and the professor was knowledgeable about the course material. From all the other courses this term, I learned quite a bit from this one in terms of Java programming and android development. Much of the content is outdated as I understand as Kotlin in the primary programming language for Android now, nonetheless, it is a fun course! **Overall course experience: 4/5**\n\n**Math for Software Development:** Meh! Amid all the different courses you'll take, this one was the most irrelevant of them all. The program organizers just squeezed in a random math course that didn't have much to do with what we learned. It would probably have been beneficial to get this course done with in level 1 as math can help developing your problem solving skills that you can use later in solving coding problems; but even then it felt irrelevant. However, the professor was okay, and the material was easy if you've studied calculus, linear algebra or statistics before. **Overall course experience: 2/5**\n\n**System Programming:** Challenging course! You'll be learning about the Linux operating system and using C as the primary language for your assignments. It was a challenging course as the professor is rigid in their expectations for the assignments, nonetheless if you pay attention, make notes, and ask LOTS of questions things will begin to make sense. **Overall course experience: 3.5/5**\n\n**Level 4 \u2013 12/25** This wasn't a good semester at all. For many students, this is where the program concludes (if your in Software Engineering Technician). That being said advanced cyber security, network application, and math were terrible courses due to the professors\u2019 lack of communication and poor curriculum content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overall:**\n\nAs I said, I don't recommend SET. I would have opted for a different option when I was applying in February 2021. Nonetheless, there may be reasons why you want to pursue SET:\n\n\\-Has a good reputation amongst organizations in KW region\n\n\\-Exposure to lots of programming languages and technology\n\n\\-Gives you an education credential on your resume\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why I wouldn't recommend it:**\n\n\\-Overall, the quality of the courses and its delivery decreases as the course levels progress.\n\n\\-Some professors do not know the material well enough to teach it.\n\n\\-Lack of consistent communication from professors (Email, Teams) after level 1.\n\n\\-You'll be a jack of all trades, but not a master in none.\n\n\\-It requires lots of time (2-3 years!).\n\n\\-You must pay tuition which is expensive!! (bootcamp or online certifications are cheaper options).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**For international students, people wanting to switch careers, or older students:**\n\n\\-Your better off choosing a specialization in software development (i.e., front-end, back-end, full stack, mobile, cyber security, data management) and taking a bootcamp or certification online. It'll save you a lot more time and you'll have a solid skill in your field of choosing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**High school students:**\n\n\\-Try SET out. You'll likely learn a lot but be warned, in later levels you won\u2019t learn as much. This is naturally due to the fact that the course quality decreases as the SET program progresses.\n\n\\-I advocate this information I presented to you for mainly: international students, people wanting to switch careers or older students as they comprised most of my cohort. These opinions are my own and feedback I\u2019ve received from my friends and fellow classmates, however I hope it helps when you want to make the decision to pursue the SET diploma.\n\n*\\*I started SET when it was online in level 1 and the first half of level 2, so this could impact my experience as well.*\n\n**Program grading:**\n\nLevel 1 \u2013 16.5/20\n\nLevel 2 \u2013 11/25\n\nLevel 3 \u2013 16/25\n\nLevel 4 \u2013 12/25\n\nTotal program score: 55.5/95 = In terms of course content, course quality, and professor performance.",

            "comment": "One of the reasons to explain the faculty quality concern is that Conestoga tends to hire industry professionals to teach some of these courses part-time. \n\nI was a part-time instructor there from 2018-2019 and it wasn't easy to teach in a more relevant manner. \n\nOne of the reasons is that I didn't have a complete picture of the outcomes of the rest of the courses because I didn't design the curriculum or worked with other faculty to improve the curriculum. \n\nI tried my best to engage students and understand their needs, but having a full-time job meant I wasn't on campus most of the week.\n\nI also tried my best to present relevant information and tie the course content to practical, real-world situations students may encounter at work.\n\nFor those folks who are currently studying there, or who plan to study there, please please please tell your professors what works and what doesn't.\n\nWhen I was a student at Conestoga, my professors took the feedback we gave them to create better student experiences for us and subsequent cohorts.",

Aforementioned, **I wouldn't recommend SET because of the following:**\n\n\\-Lack of consistent communication from professors (Email, Teams) after level 1.\n\n\\-If you already have an idea of what you want to do, its better to pursue that specialization through a certificate, bootcamp, or course (that doesn't take 2-3 year).\n\n\\-Some professors do not know the material well enough to teach it.\n\n\"Issue of being a jack of all trades.\" Could be, makes sense school whether it be college or university teaches you a broad range of topics and concepts hence why you'll be a \"jack of all trades.\" Afterwards, you can find the area you want to specialize in.\n\nYou must have heard a lot of positive stuff, there are great aspects to the program which I've even mentioned above. Additionally, a 16-month co-op is a huge incentive to joining SET as you get paid work experience and get to learn at the same time. However, I'm solely discussing the course content above.",

When I refer to communication this includes unread emails or Teams messages, or simply the professor doesn't know how to answer the question I'm asking. Most times, they can be helpful but sometimes they can be just as lost as you, hence you need to find your own unique way to troubleshoot the issue. SET is a great diploma credential. As mentioned before, it has a good reputation so getting hired in IT shouldn't be an issue as long as you put in the effort. Still consider it if you want a decent job after graduation, however you'll have to make a decision if its right for you based on the course material mentioned above.",

However, if you warned me about the other side of the program where you'll have a lot of redundant courses or professors that simply don't know how to communicate or teach I would have opted for another option. Same feedback I got from other students in the program.\n\nHowever, at the end of the day you'll need to make a decision that works best for you.",

    "postText": "Hey there! I\u2019m looking at going to Conestoga next year for Comp Eng technology or Electronic Eng technology and already have my conditionals, When looking at the required materials it only states a technology kit, but looking at the bookstore online I cant find it, and only see a bunch of specific kits for Electronics, Eet, and Pse.\n\nso my question is\n\nWhich of these kits are required for those programs? (for all three years) and if there are any tools I should buy separately that will help me out during my time there?\n\nThanks in advance for the help :)\nLooking forward to what you guys have to say!",

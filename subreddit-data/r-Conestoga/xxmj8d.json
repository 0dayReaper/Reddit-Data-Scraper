    "postText": "Hello. I am a college graduate interested in the Applied Healh Information Science Program. I know for certain diplomas they give you an alternative schedule and you only complete 2 yrs. Can any students or graduates of this program please explain how your expirence has been in this program? Also, here are some questions I have:\n\nHow hard are the classes?\n\nIs there a lot of Math involved (im not the best at math)?\n\nDoes everyone get a Co-op and how does the process work?\n\nWere you able to get a job after graduation? \n\nIn most classes are there a lot of assignments (essays?) or just exam based testing? \n\nWill the database and programing classes be difficult if you have never coded (ex. SQL) before?\n\nIf you fail a class what would happen (ex. option to repeat or have to wait an entire year to retake class)\n\nWould you recommend this program to others?\n\nAlso please let me know anything else you think I should know about the program. Thank You!!",

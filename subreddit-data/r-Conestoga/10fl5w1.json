    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI applied in Conestoga just last week for the September intake. I have 7 overall bands in IELTS, with no bands less than 6.\n\nMy GPA is kinda low, around 2.8 out of 4. But that's not really the issue. The real issue with my profile is BACKLOGS. I have too many of them, around 20 (i am applying from India). And for this reason alone i am tensed about whether i will get the admit or not.\n\nPS : I have applied for a PGDM course in machine learning and ai (1557) in the waterloo campus.\n\nIf you guys have any idea and would like to share of should i have any hope of getting an admit or not, that would be super helpful.",

I had experienced the same issues, they'll not respond to you I'm very sure. However, they give out offer letters quite late, so yea you'll get it but just wait a while i guess, that's your only option for now. \n\nHonestly even if you approach the international student service through someone, you'll only get to know if you're being considered or not yet. Nothing is gonna be black and white till you get a letter or rejection.",

I no nothing of bands or backlog but if they took me, they\u2019ll take anyone. Only reason people don\u2019t get I. Is if the program they choose is full to capacity. Even then, they let a couple extra in.",

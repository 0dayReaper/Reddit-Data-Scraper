That is just one example. See MPP Pachini's Instagram post (March 26). I could list multiple if I had the time! \"They want to add a $300 bus pass on top of your parking permit.\" Students collectively voted for a universal bus pass through a student body-wide referendum. \"They\u2019re sitting on millions of dollars stolen from students\" What are the basis of these claims? where in the budget is there a surplus of millions of dollars?",

Which is why I am asking students to let CSI know ASAP.\n\nHopefully, they send out a statement like we are looking at this and will provide a update by [a date]",

The system didn't get going until 8 or 9 at the start of the school year so most people wouldn't pay and got ticketed because they couldn't pay for their parking before class started, and our teachers are hard asses about phones in class.",

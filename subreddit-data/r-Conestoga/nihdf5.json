I'm heading back to school for SET(software technology engineering) and as you can learn a lot of coding/programing by yourself online through various tools, the first year coordinator recommends the intro to CS course on edx. I also have done a little bit on codecademy. and this field can work from home pretty well, but different fields will have different effectiveness with the online learning on top of how you feel about learning more on your own/having to be more self directed if things end up being more online. as I have graduated a program previously first semester of first year also tends to be pretty easy overall with intro courses, especially if you already have some background in whatever your studying.",

I know the coding and such can be pretty self directed learning wise with a ton of third party resources from youtube/codecademy/other online CS courses, did you find you needed that or were the online courses offered sufficient in providing enough? I'm heading back to school for a career change and should have enough savings to get me through without having to work just trying to know what I should be expecting come fall.",

I appreciate the information man, yea when I was looking at the 2nd year courses on the outline it looked a lot heavier.\n\nMy current game plan is to do some C+ course on codecademy(I've done maybe 15 hours on there so far mostly holding off till the summer I might take a month or two off work ahead of time to prep and hopefully get back into a routine of hitting the gym and stuff Covid has really messed stuff up), the edx intro to CS that the first year coordinator recommends and maybe read a couple books(I know the first year coordinator shared a programming book humble bundle on here I picked up)\n\nIs there much math in the first year? I've been working as a welder/fitter for 5 years want to switch to something easier on my body and with more room to grow over the years, its been sometime since I've been in school so I just want to make sure I'm prepared as possible.",

Millions of others were put in this position too.\n\nI am in the exact same boat. First year was in-class, 2nd year entirely online. It had its pros and cons. But would you have rathered lost a year of your life working or doing nothing? I wouldn't have. Ultimately **YOU** are responsible for your education and what you get out of it. There are many people less fortunate in the world and would have been grateful for the opportunity to even be schooled. \n\nSo don't say you got \"nothing out of it\". That is a disservice to this place as an institution and the faculty that actually put in work to keep things going in a volatile period in human history.",

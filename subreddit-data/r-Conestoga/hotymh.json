    "postText": "I'm wondering if any students, and especially faculty, could provide some insight into what the actual online learning process will be like come the fall semester for full-time students.\n\nWill there still be scheduled classes with lectures? (some professors apparently merely post notes online). What will lab classes look like? How will students be able to contact faculty if they have questions, etc.\n\nThere's little info about what the learning experience is like, so insight from anyone who has already experienced this format would be helpful. Thanks!",

I think they will be live zooms, but also will be recorded and posted on eConestoga so you can revisit and use it to study. \n\nThe college has been training faculty all summer on different technologies they can use to teach remotely. There are requirements each faculty needs to meet, however you will find that each course will vary depending on the faculty and material.\n\n(I\u2019m a full time staff member)",

Am a new immigrant and I'm considering getting a certificate to kick-start a career in Canada. \nI recieved offers for both project management and occupational health and safety, I'm leaning more towards the project management coz I have around 6 years of experience in planning/scheduling and think doing PMP after would be helpful.",

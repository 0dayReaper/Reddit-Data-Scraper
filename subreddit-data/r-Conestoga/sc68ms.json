Say i land on a job on June 2023 and apply for PGWP. The processing time of PGWP will take minimim a month or two lets say i am getting my PGWP on august 2023, in which case it will be valid till august 2024(for a year). If i start gaining experience from june 2023, by june 2024, i would have gained 1 year experience before 2 months when my PGWP expires, once i gained a year's experience, i will immediately apply for PR and wait for ITA. if in case the ITA takes time to arrive, i need to apply for bridge permit and extend my stay in canada until i get my PR at hand. Is my understanding right ?",

Ideally, i need to land on a job within 3 or 4 months worst case scenario. Am I right ?",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nMy question is about how strict is the college of Conestoga on parameters like attendance (how much attendance is mandatory and what happens if you have low attendance percentage), Grading (Is it easy to score in exams in Conestoga) and difficulty(Difficult to pass exams?) of the courses in general.\n\nEdit: \n\nCourse: PGDM in computer application development (1year Duration)",

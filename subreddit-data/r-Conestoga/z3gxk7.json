Overall, which course should be easier   to attend? I'm looking to join the college and was wondering about these details that are not mentioned in the website.",

            "comment": "Your schedule is available once you finish registration for the course. I'm not in those courses but similar courses have classes 4-5 days a week. If it's hybrid then couple classes online rest offline. And usually lectures are 3 hours.",

    "postText": "Currently, I am in an advanced diploma program and just finished my 4th sem this winter. However, I want to switch to a diploma course. \nMost subjects are similar between those courses; only 20-30% differ. \nSo is it possible to change after finishing the 4th sem and enroll in a diploma course this fall for some different subjects including electives?\nI have not talked to the coordinator yet, but going to talk after college starts. I want to know if someone had the same case and would like to get some suggestions too.",

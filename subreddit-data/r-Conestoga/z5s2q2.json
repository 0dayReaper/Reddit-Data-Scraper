    "postText": "Looking for unis/colleges to apply for, thinking something in stem, and some of Conestoga's bachelor's programs seem perfect for me. I have high 90s on my midterms, so I think I could get into some good unis, but I also think I won't enjoy the traditional uni style learning, so my effort would be better spent at a college. Then I found out about the bachelor's programs at Conestoga, and they seem like they would be perfect because (if I understand correctly), they're more hands on learning, but they still give the same sort of credentials as at a uni.\n\nI know employers look at the institution you went to, so I'm just wondering how graduates of these programs do compared to graduates of similar programs at actual unis. I'm thinking employers would be like \"Oh! He has a bachelor's in x! Oh wait... but he went to Conestoga... not a real uni! &gt;:(\"",

I had 4 separate job offers from every interview I took before I graduated, and I now work at a big-4 accounting firm where I was promoted to a senior role within 10 months of joining - faster than all of my coworkers who were hired with me, all of which had university degrees.  \n\n\nConestoga is what you make it. All the tools are there. If you need to lean on historical prestige associated with a degree you're doing it wrong, and so is the person interviewing you.",

Networking will always trump anything on your resume. \n\nCan't speak for all of them obviously, but a lot of the programs at Conestoga are more hands-on like you said, and they also provide great opportunities to network which is far more valuable.",

In addition, once you\u2019re a year or two out of school with some experience, no one cares about your school anymore. \n\nAnd as the previous commenter said, your personal network will always be the most important factor in landing a job.",

This was 100% due to the co-op terms that were required...the networking was great and I owe quite a lot to that.  I had pretty good grades throughout, 90s like you do now.  The programs there are really quite good.",

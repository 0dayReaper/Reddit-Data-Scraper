    "postText": "Just looking for info on what you\u2019ve found helpful for the program. \n\nWhat type of stethoscope you find has been the best, is a Cardiology IV needed? Or was just a classic III ok? \n\nIs there a place to purchase uniforms/texts/ items from graduating students? \n\nAnything you bought, or wish you bought for the program? \n\nFor those of you in Res, what items did you have or wish you had? \n\nJust starting to purchase items now for Sept 2023.  Any help/ideas would be appreciated.",

I wouldn't waste your money buying one before, wait until they go on sale \nPurchase scrubs from the school store or FIGS, teachers will email if graduating students are selling their scrubs \nTextbooks are all online so you can't purchase those\nJust focus on completing all the CPR and police check and immunizations needed ASAP \nI'm not in res but my friends in res say air fryer and rice cooker were most used",

However I think I\u2019d benefit to redo the whole program (9 month certificate program) to help my GPA for the program I wish to get into afterwards. \n\nIt\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve been in college and now that I got a feel for everything again I understand where I went wrong, and how to better my studies. So I would rather just do the whole thing again instead of one class",

    "postText": "So I am still on admissions process and I  just paid the initial 1500  cad fee . \nShould I wait for something , any extra document that will come from the college. \nOr I should just pay my first semester tuition fees. \nThen apply for visa . \nCause the consultant saying that the college will send me a second document called LOA after the 1500 cad payment. Which I find very confusing cause I have already received LOA at first place. \n\nAnyone familiar with the admission process will know what I am  talking about .",

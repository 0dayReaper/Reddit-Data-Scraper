    "postText": "I received my conditional acceptance offer in late January and accepted it through ontariocolleges.ca for the 2023 fall intake. I also have my login credentials for the Conestoga student portal and check in on it every once in a while. One thing I\u2019m concerned about is tuition fees and deposits. Currently under my financial tab I have no fees or invoice. Am I not able to pay any tuition or fees yet or is this an error?",

            "comment": "$500 Deposit for September intake is due mid-June. I believe this is so there is time for your school to provide final grades, allowing you to fulfill your conditions, or so you at least have a pretty good idea whether you\u2019ll fulfill them. Tuition is due in august/sept. All these milestones are months away.",

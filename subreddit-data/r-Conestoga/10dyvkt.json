Depending on your issue, it will likely be much easier and quicker for you to go in than doing things over email. Speaking with the office in person is less of a headache than the runaround they give you with email.",

I asked the same question five times which was \u201cIf I travel to campus to switch from full time to part time, will they help me?\u201d She let saying \u201cyou can do it online\u201d. I said that there\u2019s a time constraint and every email has an auto reply for 3-5 business days. After she kept giving me the same answer I got pissy. I said \u201cyou haven\u2019t answered my question and I\u2019ve asked it five times now. I\u2019ve told you that doing things online is inefficient and I\u2019ve been directed to the wrong place repeatedly by you guys.\u201d She told me they\u2019d only direct me to do it online and wouldn\u2019t help me. So, I was conflicted because the people on the phone had yet to be right about anything.",

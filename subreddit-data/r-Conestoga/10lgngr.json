You will need to install a windows virtual machine to run certain programs like visual studio (I know you can technically get it for mac now, but from what ive been told its really janky and people seem to just use a VM for VS instead of the mac version). If you have problems running things on your mac, it's really up to you alone to try and find the solution (if there even is a solution). Everyone I know who had a mac had some partner or group mate who used windows to fall back on if something critical happened. If you want to save yourself some headaches, get a windows based computer if you can.",

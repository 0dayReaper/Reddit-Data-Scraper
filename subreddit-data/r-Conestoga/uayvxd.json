I drive to Doon Campus Monday-Friday (every other Wednesday and Friday wfh) leaving at 720ish and coming home to Guelph at 4ish.\n\nI am looking to drive folks from Guelph to Doon Campus who need a ride :) I'm super friendly, easy to talk to, and have a brand new 2022 compact SUV that I would love to share with you if you're looking for a ride to and/or from campus.\n\n$10 a day. Holler over PM or Instagram (@orangadang) if interested. Thanks!",

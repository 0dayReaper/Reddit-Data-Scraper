It\u2019s been over two weeks now and nothing. I drove to the campus hours away and was told to submit withdrawal in Student Portal (why wasn\u2019t I told this on the phone?). I submitted before the deadline for refund. I notified all of my instructors of my withdrawal. I\u2019m still getting bombarded with course emails. I just want it to stop. This is ridiculous. Why is the administration so slow and useless?",

            "comment": "I somewhat agree the process isn't made very clear, but some Googling does reveal the answer. The withdrawal form is referenced in the website as within the student portal. https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/registrar-office/student-forms\nSign in to the Student Portal. Select the \"Services\" tab, \"My Forms\" button for the Withdrawal form. I assume there would be instructions on it for where / how to submit. \n\nI'm all for you emailing the registrar themselves, though, asking for this process to be specifically mentioned in the top Google search web results for withdrawing from Conestoga. It wouldn't hurt them to just put a quick steps process guide on there.",

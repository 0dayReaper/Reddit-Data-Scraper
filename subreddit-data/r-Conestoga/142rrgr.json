Like I would enter all my info and it would load the page only to ask for my info again and again. \n\nThe student portal absolutely needs an upgrade. I was a student at Conestoga 8 years ago and was shocked when I realized the student portal hadn\u2019t changed at all since then lol",

I just hope this is technical difficulties during the influx of people like me starting in September, all paying their fees and getting registered, rather than an omen of consistent problems to come.",

    "postText": "Hey guys/girls!  I was happy to find out I was accepted today, I was also accepted to Fanshawe for Electrical Engineering Technician and have pending results from a couple other colleges. \n\nI am just wondering if anyone has taken this program and any information or opinions on it, trying to do some research before making my choice.  I do not currently have a co-op I elected to apply on my own with hopes of getting a better career in a few years but I also have read having a co-op while attending is highly recommended.  I don't really know what else to put here but any advice from graduates or students is appreciated.  I am 34, haven't been in college since I was in my mid 20s.\n\nI will be going to the college to ask for a tour and as much information as possible in the near future too.\n\nThanks everyone in advance!",

Do these students taking the program at Conestoga get signed on as a first year apprentice with any of these companies they do their co-op with? Does the program help you get apprenticeships post grad? What are the odds you\u2019ll get an apprenticeship post grad and a company to sponsor you?",

I\u2019ve only ever heard of 5-6 MAX, even for university. And it says I need an elective but since I already have 6 courses, I\u2019m being charged $300 for an elective I\u2019m pretty positive I need.",

Courses can be 1-5 credit hours each so someone taking a course with a lab (usually the lab is 1 credit hour) and a couple 2 credit hour courses, it would not be out of the ordinary to have that student taking 7 or 8 \"courses\".",

    "postText": "Hey Condors, new management here. The old owners of this subreddit kind of abandoned it, so I decided to take over, clean out the trash and spruce up the place with our school colours (well, supposedly our colours are red and navy blue, but the site and our ads are all black and gold so I went with the nicer-looking option.) It's still a work in progress, please forgive the weird colours in some areas.\n\nStill, a bit of cleaning only goes so far. The heart of any community is the members, and I'd like to know what the members want. Should the mods post school events (fire drills, CSI events, snow days) or leave that to official channels? I love Spotted at Conestoga and it'd be amazing if this sub could be kind of like that for the community, a place to have discussions and share neat stuff. If you have any suggestions or ideas, please let us know!",

I don't spend much time at school, it's a rush of people and the posters are in the most crowded places, so I never get time to check anything out. I spend tons of time on reddit, check up here everyday to see if it magically became a place of news and funny things. \n\nIt's more lively this term, which is a nice change. Great to see that we haven't been abandoned completely. ",

Something like the Conestoga website might be better.\n\nIf you have a smartphone, the CSI app is surprisingly good for event info (it should be with how much tuition we pay them). I'll post events starting next week, we'll see if it's liked or not. ",

D:\n\nAre you involved in the school a bunch? Just curious. I've been here 3 years and know so little about what's going on. How else do you plan on spreading the word? Looking at the other school subreddits there's a lot of good that can happen here. I'd love to have some Conestoga friends. ",

But it's also pretty salty and venty: compare SaC to other colleges' Spotted pages. \n\nI'm not incredibly involved, I'm also in the third year of my program and a part of my program's society. I actually don't have a plan for promoting it: the school doesn't like the promotion of unofficial clubs or groups on campus. Learned that from a prior thing for my program. And reddit's not nearly as popular here among the current student population as I expected. Word of mouth's pretty much all I can think of.",

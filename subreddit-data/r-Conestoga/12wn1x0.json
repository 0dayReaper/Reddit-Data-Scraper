            "comment": "I took one semester of robotics and automation, not industrial, failed. it was my fault tho. I thought everything would be in person, but it wasn't and I can't learn online, skill issue.\n\n\nThe first semester will have AutoCAD, \nmath that involves lots of  trigonometry with weekly tests\n \nelectrical theory and components online lessons + in person  labs biweekly \n\nhydraulics/ pneumatics online lessons + in person labs\nexcel+visual basic (hated by all, no one will use it later) \n\nEnglish is easy, but you gotta remember to do it, as it's online and easy to ignore\n\nMachining, teachers are great and will teach you how to mill and lathe\n\nyou don't really need to lease the laptop, as my friend in the program didn't do that but still got a laptop. don't pay for any of the optional fees, you won't really be able to benefit from them.\n\nCambridge fountain is a new campus, but is surrounded by farm and highways. you got 2 buses that run there and a student shuttle that runs from doon to fountain\n\nfrom what I heard about the second semester, its hard.\n\nthat's about all, if you got more questions, ask away",

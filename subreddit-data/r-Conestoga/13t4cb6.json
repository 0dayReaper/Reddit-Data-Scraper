    "postText": "Hello Everyone,\n\n I am a 25 year old Metallurgy and Material Engineer in Turkey. I graduated from Kocaeli University's 4 year bachelor license (It is a generally known engineering university in Turkey). I am also continuing my bachelor education in Business Administration (4 years) at Istanbul University. Currently I am at third year of the program. I'm looking Conestoga College's programs for improve myself in future. I need to choose one of these;\n\n1-  Applied Manufacturing Management - Welding Stream \n\n2- Manufacturing Engineering Technology - Welding and Robotics (Optional Co-op) \n\n3- Process Quality Engineering\n\n4-  Structural Steel Management and Detailing\n\n I know these are different paths and choice. Let me introduce myself; \n\n I have 1 year intern experience at Lincoln Electric R&amp;D department. During the internship, I had applied welding training from the welding master and theoretical training from the engineer. . Also I finished my university tesis about the Physical and microstructural effects of elements in wire rods used in welding wire production.  \n  Apart from these, I have 6 months of Business Development experience in an international investment casting company.\n\n  I know there are experience difference. But I need to consider the programs with all directions. What are the job opportunities, what you suggest to be best?",

I may not be accepted in the university selection. Because my engineering GPA is 2.90/4. According to my advisor with these college options I can get quick and sure admission.",

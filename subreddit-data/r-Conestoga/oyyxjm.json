    "postText": "Am I the only one who is constantly experiencing problems logging into the student portal? Not sure if the issue lies with my computer or the website.\n\nWhether I\u2019m on Chrome or Safari, pressing the \u2018Student Number Sign In\u2019 button gives me a message saying \u201cYou must login using the Conestoga Email Sign In button found above.\u201d When I try pressing the \u2018Conestoga Email Sign In\u2019 button on Chrome, it just refreshes my page. When I try it on Safari, it either tells me \u2018We couldn\u2019t sign you in. Please try again.\u2019 or \u2018Sorry, but we\u2019re having trouble signing you in.\u2019\n\nI was experiencing this problem when signing in to pay my deposit, and now I\u2019m experiencing it again while signing in to pay my fees. I believe it ended up working last time after waiting and trying again the next day. I\u2019m just hoping this isn\u2019t something I\u2019m going to have to endure during my time at Conestoga, as it is extremely frustrating. If anyone is experiencing similar issues, or may have a solution to this, please feel free to leave a comment. Thanks!",

    "postText": "I was looking into the requirements for the SETechnology course and it recommends a quite standard laptop. I own a Surface Pro 8 but it only has 8gb of ram and I'm worried that might be too little for the workload. I own a desktop that surpasses all the requirements but I'm not sure if there will be moments where my laptop is needed but it can not perform.\n\nI have a laptop I'm looking at just incase that meets the specs, but the question is: Will I survive with low ram or is it really worth spending extra money on something that meets the requirements better?",

You can do lighter workloads on your laptop, transfer it to your desktop when you get home and work comfortably on it. Or like previously mentioned, run the virtual machine.\n\nIn my case, I try to save money where I can, so long as I'm still productive....but if you do get a laptop, try getting one where you can upgrade your RAM and/or storage capacity. I gave my old used HP shit box 2 more years of life going from 2 x 4gb to 8gb + 4gb for $25",

However, your current Surface won't cut it. 8GB will make you miserable and might not be adequate for virtual machines. What I recommend is:\n\n* Windows laptop using Windows 10 or 11 (older MacBook running Windows might be OK; definitely not an M1 or newer MacBook due to compatibility issues)\n* CPU: i5 equivalent\n* RAM: 16GB\n* SSD: 500GB\n* 15\" screen or greater (recommended resolution 1920x1080)\n* Second monitor for home use\n* Webcam\n* Good quality headset\n* External mouse\n\nSource: I'm the Year 1 SET Coordinator (but I had nothing to do with the official specs)",

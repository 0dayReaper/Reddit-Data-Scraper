            "comment": "If you\u2019re looking for an alternative to BCS to dip your toes in the water, I would first try Computer Programming and Analysis (0057, 3 years w/ optional co-op). While also meant for beginners with no experience, I imagine it goes a little slower pace with less of the pressure that a Bachelors degree will carry.\n\nWhen you complete the 3 year program, you can transfer and fast track into the third year of the Bachelors of Computer Science program. That also has another co-op segment to gain more job experience.\n\nShould you be lucky enough, you\u2019ll walk away with 2 years of work experience from co-ops, an advanced diploma for Computer Programming and Analysis, and a Bachelor\u2019s of Computer Science. The networking that you\u2019ll do along the way will also be crucial to your success.",

They say it\u2019s for beginners with zero experience but they move way too fast for people with zero experience. Throwing terms at you on the first day and expecting you to know what they mean without teaching you. \n\nOne of my professors was so bad that I would just watch YouTube videos on the subjects He was teaching during class instead of listening to him. \n\nI didn\u2019t have a great experience but maybe others have had a different experience.",

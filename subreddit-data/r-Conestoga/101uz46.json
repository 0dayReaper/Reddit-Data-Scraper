Do you have to do the same?\n\nDescribe your:\nissues and reasons why you aren't meeting the requirements,\n\nhow you can improve so this doesn't happen again, \n\nand your plan to succeed.\n\nThey want your money. My university also paired me with an improvement coach while I was on academic probation to meet with them weekly to plan out how I can keep to a schedule and meet goals. I honestly wish I kept in touch with those people but I had completely forgotten about them until this post.\n\nAlso maybe google how to write an academic appeal. Others have had to do the same.",

I was also on academic probation when I was a student at the University of Ottawa and I got nothing like the support you did, just a meeting with an academic advisor who pretty much just told me to drop courses.",

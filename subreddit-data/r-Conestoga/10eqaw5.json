No Power BI or Tableau as of yet, and it's not looking like we will learn either this term. \n\nFeel free to send me a message if you have any questions about the program!",

It is a two semester program. \n\n\nNot having a tech background won't be an issue, but there will be people in the program who have one. So you'll need to put in extra work to differentiate yourself from the cohort. I did not start the program with a tech background either, and I am getting called in for interviews in the Data/Business analytics sphere. \n\n\nSo, it's definitely possible for you to get a job in an analytical role following the program. The thing is, you need to put in the work for it every day. If you're serious about pursuing a career in analytics then start learning as soon as possible. Pick up the basics of SQL and choose either Python or R to begin learning before the start of the program. If you make a GitHub profile, then almost every project you get is a chance to expand your portfolio. Coursera is a fantastic resource for this if you aren't comfortable with solo learning. \n\n\nI think the largest boon of the program is the networking opportunities, though. All of our instructors are well seasoned professionals in the analytics industry, and every project you submit to them is a chance to show off your skills as a Jr Analyst. If you prove to them that you're dedicated to learning and passionate about data, then they will do everything they can to help you find success. \n\n\nI hope this answers your questions. Let me know if I can clarify anything or offer more information!",

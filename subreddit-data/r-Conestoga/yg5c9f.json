    "postText": "Hello! Im from Ontario and am going to be going to Respiratory therapy school at Algonquin college in the fall and the last of the admissions offers went out today. When I was applying I didn't find a lot of information on dates or even what grade range I should aim for. So I'm going to share my experience and hopefully it will help someone who is applying or thinking of applying!\n\nSo for reference I am currently in my 4th year of a BSc in human kinetics from UOG where I have a 70% average. In high school I had a 82% U english, 84% U bio, 77% U chem, 70% U advanced functions, 70% AP g11 physics. I did academic upgrading through TVO ILC where I finished with a 98% C math, 95% C chem and 92% C physics. \n\nI sent out my Ontario colleges application October 2nd to Algonquin college, St, Clair, Fanshawe, Conestoga and Canadore college. St. Clair, Canadore, and Fanshawe only look at grades. Algonquin requires the AC-HPAT, and conestoga requires you to do a portfolio assignment. \n\nFor the AC-HPAT I scored a 8/8 essay, 274/300 reading, 272/300, math and a 52/60 science for a total score of 1133/1200 which is a 94%. If you need advice or information check algonquins reddit.\n\nConestoga's portfolio was emailed to me January 5th and was due January 21st. You had to talk about volunteer experiences, leadership experience, certificates, degrees and diplomas, and awards. There is also a 1 min recorded video interview about what you know about RT and what makes you a good one. You also need letters of recommendation from those leadership and volunteer experiences so get those in advance!\n\nCanadore sent out acceptances on February 2nd, Algonquin sent out acceptances on February 18th, Fanshawe's went out march 2nd, and St.Clair and Conestoga was sent out March 16th. \n\nI got accepted to the 4, I was waitlisted by Fanshawe. Algonquin was my first choice and I'm very excited to start. Good luck! feel free to DM me with any questions!\n\nEdit: i did get accepted to fanshawe off the waitlist in June",

I have a bachelors degree (but not in health science) and was wondering if those grades would even be considered, the website seems to imply they wont be. Additionally for the portfolio do they want work experience as well?",

I don't remember if its 8 or 10 additional marks, but those can come from high school or uni. \nAnd no its not exactly job experence but u can talk about a leadership experence at a job",

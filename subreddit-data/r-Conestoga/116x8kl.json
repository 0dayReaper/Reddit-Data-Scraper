I know I can bridge into BDES after the advanced diploma but has anyone actually done that? \n\nPlease share your experiences and help me with this life-changing decision",

            "comment": "I can't speak for the design programs themselves, but I do have experience as someone who has bridged into a different degree program after completing an advanced diploma at Conestoga. \n\nThe only real reason to intentionally start with the diploma is if you're concerned about your finances. The lower tuition allows you to pick up a part-time job for the first three years to prepare you for the more-expensive two degree years. A secondary advantage of this is that, after three years, you may decide that you're happy with just the diploma to start your career.\n\nIf you're financially in a position to go straight into the degree, and you don't have any personal/family/external reasons for needing to finish a year early, then I'd 100% recommend just starting in the degree program. \n\nAs for the design program, I'm sure you know about the industry better than me, but my understanding is that employers are just as interested in your portfolio as your educational background. So regardless of what program you pick, make sure to produce as much good work as you can! Good luck!",

I do work and have two children so the idea that 3 years might be enough but there's an option if they rant is interesting. Also with the advanced diploma it is very clearly geared at Graphic Design where the Bach. is more of an overview with graphic design included",

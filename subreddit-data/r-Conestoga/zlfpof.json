    "postText": "Title just about says it all, I am currently a student in a degree program but I've come to terms that I really, really do not care to pursue a career in the business/finance field. I just joined this program for the sake of getting a job out of school, but I would rather switch to a trades program for the sake of earning a steady income sooner than later. \n\nI have only one exam left so I just planning on finishing this semester before withdrawing, but the HVAC program I am looking into starts in January and has a waitlist. As such, I am hoping to apply ASAP (as early as tomorrow), but I am unsure if I am able to do so while concurrently enrolled in another Conestoga program? \n\nAny answers or inputs are much appreciated!!",

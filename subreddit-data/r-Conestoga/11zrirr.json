    "postText": "I'm wondering if anyone has had experience with the electrical technician-industrial program at Conestoga. I have applied and been accepted to this program, but I am unsure if I should attend. I would love to hear anyone's experience with the program if they were able to find a good co-op, with an industrial electrical company and how the job search went post-graduation\n\n I am currently in the Renewable Energy Techniques program at Conestoga and have been very disappointed with the program and don't want to make a mistake like that again.",

One friend of mine did work as pipe bender. Other worked in electrical material sale. Residential workers did too many box, light and outlet installation. So there many different types of jobs.\nI applied 36 jobs for my first coop. And I got 3 offer. (I had no experience) So it is not very hard to find coop. As a level 5 student in this program, I recommend you this program.",

The curriculum in this program is basically exactly what you would learn in trade school. Don't get me wrong It is a great program, I have done it. However you will loose out on time you could be getting paid to learn!I found there was no help after graduating the program and alot of people struggled to find work having still no real job exp. in the trade only a diploma to show.",

It's not easy as a green (no exp.) despite what the government says about a trades boom. Alot of young people want to be electricians thinking it's a cleaner trade vs. say plumbing or drywall..haha\n\nBut the fact is it may not be any easier finding employment after spending the time and money on the course. Yeah co-op  is good but most of the time companies just do that for $$ and don't even hire. It just delays the process of finding real work and getting paid. Every year that program is rammed with  folks trying to find jobs at all the same time.",

Ive sent /u/notzarathustra a pm and we should deal with it through there. I've seen a few other people post similar situations, the best place to start is definitely not reddit. You need to contact the correct offices, (i.e International student office or admissions). I've reached out to someone in the student association to hopefully assist with this as well!  \n\n\nAlso for other students who have their letters of acceptance and/or starting this or next semester, make sure you cross your T's and dot your I's carefully to ensure that an issue like this doesn't occur.",

Proof of study permit authorization/approval letter is uploaded to the Ontario colleges.ca International Applicants Portal\" \n\nYou able to double check that you did this too? If so, it's definitely a bad look for the college because everything else looks ok. And even if missed, it is still pretty lame of the college to blindside you by rejecting you the day the semester starts.\n\nPut pressure on them to get a refund ASAP. It should take days, not months IMO.\n\nWishing you all the best.",

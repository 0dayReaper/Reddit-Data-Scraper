Once you are in Canada go to bank, activate account easily.",

After 5 working days again called bank to activate GIC, this time GIC is activated and the debit card is dispatched. It took another 3 days to receive the debit card. Then call bank again to activate the card, setup internet banking, mobile banking. We called more than 10times for this entire process. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy other colleagues with CIBC, Scotia banks - open bank website, book appointment after 3-4 days (you can book from your home country within 1-2 days of your arrival to Canada), go in person to bank with valid ID proof, talk with representative, activate GIC, get Debit card immediately. Easily done. you will get credit card after 3-4 days to your address.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope my answers helps you to take better decision.",

The return on investment on a GIC is terrible. If you must get a GIC, check out the rates here: https://wowa.ca/gic-rates\n\nIf you are looking for a Canadian bank in general, they all suck. I am assuming you are a student or young person. Don't worry about if there is a branch in your area. Search Google maps for 'bank-name ATM' instead. (RBC ATM, CIBC ATM, etc)\n\nLook for a bank that has low fees, or provides a way to waive fees. Most banks charge a $16/monthly service fee.\n\n$16 x 12 months = $192/year!\n\nAt current market rate, if you  buy a GIC with 3.5% return you need to put in at LEAST $5485.71 to break even. \n\nHint: 5485.71 * 3.5% = $192\n\nIf you have less than $5,500 to put into a GIC, don't do it. You're better off putting the money as pure cash into a CIBC chequing account.\nCIBC waves the banking fee if you have a balance over 4000. \n\nGood Luck",

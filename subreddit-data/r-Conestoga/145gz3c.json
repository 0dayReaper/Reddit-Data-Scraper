I\u2019ve tried several password variations with capitalized letters, numbers and symbols, but everytime, I get an error message that says \u201cYour new password doesn\u2019t meet your organization\u2019s password policy.  Try something else, or talk to you admin for tips.\u201d  \n\nDoes anyone know what Conestoga is looking for when it comes to acceptable passwords?",

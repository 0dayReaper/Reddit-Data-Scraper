    "postText": "I submitted the opt-out for the CSI Health Insurance Plan. The opt-out period ended September 30th. According to StudentCare, \"opt-out refunds are issued approximately 6-8 weeks after the terms Change-of-Coverage Period (ended on Sept.30th).\"\n\nDoes anybody know more specifically when the refunds will be issued? I selected to receive my refund by e-transfer. An \"extra\" $300 would be quite handy!",

    "postText": "If you are listed as being Pre-registered or if you do not see a  timetable on the Student Portal AND you feel that your fees were paid on time and are up-to-date, you likely have to do one more thing: confirm your invoice.   Because of the provincial government\u2019s action of making certain fees optional, you are not fully registered until you confirm the invoice.\n\nThe instructions on how to do so should be readily available to you but  my understanding is that you need to go under the Financial tab on the  Student Portal, view your invoice, and confirm it.  \n\nBecause so many  students have not done so yet, there might be a significant delay  (hours) before you can see your timetable today.",

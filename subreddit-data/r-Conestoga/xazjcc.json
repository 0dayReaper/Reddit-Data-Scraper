Anyone here in need of saving money on their internet, mobile, data protection, or hydro? Hit me up \ud83d\ude0a\n\nWant to learn more about an awesome opportunity to earn income for yourselves while you pursue your careers? I have a zoom meeting Tuesday at 6 with someone who's been in the industry longer and has had a lot of success. \n\nThe zoom meeting is 20 minutes long and you have to see it the way I did. I promise you have nothing to lose but those 20 minutes",

Which is 15.5$ an hour. And finding jobs in KWC is a mixed bag. I've heard some find it difficult, for others it's been easier.",

The only thing I\u2019ll add is that if you\u2019re trying to create a budget for your time here, just assume that you\u2019ll be making minimum wage. That way any extra money you make will be \u201cextra\u201d. Best of luck!",

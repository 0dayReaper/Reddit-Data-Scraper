Conestoga Student Financial Services emailed me saying my OSAP application was approved but then I still get emails reminding me to pay my fee. All OSAP recipients get their funds in September but then they say late payment could may not guarantee your seat in your program..",

IIRC there should've been a checkmark box + confirm. If you don't see that, most likely you already checked off that you are an osap student (otherwise there you'll have to contact financial aid).  \n\n\nHere's a link to all the support contact info: https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/contact",

    "postText": "Hello! Diwali is next Monday (Oct 24). Call your mom! :)\n\nI'm Aastha, a reporter for CBC News. I'm checking in with first-year international students who will be celebrating Diwali away from family for the first time. How do you plan to celebrate? Will you still make rangoli at your home?\n\nLet's celebrate together! I'd love to come by and see how you've decorated your home and how you're keeping in touch with family back home. **I am looking to connect specifically with students who attend the Waterloo campus.**\n\nSend me a DM or email me at [aastha.shetty@cbc.ca](mailto:aastha.shetty@cbc.ca) if you'd like to chat for news purposes!",

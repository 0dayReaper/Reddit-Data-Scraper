    "postText": "I  ran across a great \"Humble Bundle\" deal today that those of you entering programs in the Fall that involve computer programming might be interested in.\u00a0 The way that \"Humble Bundle\" works is that you pay a  certain amount and you receive DRM-free e-copies of books (in this case)  (and it supports charities too).\u00a0 This bundle is especially good for beginning programmers or those with some experience in some languages but not others (e.g. Rust, Python, shell scripts):\n\n$1.26 gets you:\n\n* Think Like A Programmer (which is the book that I recommend for beginning programmers in my C course in the SET program)\n* Python Playground\n* Wicked Cool Shell Scripts\n* Learn Java The Easy Way\n\nThere are additional levels at $12.64 and $22.75 to get you books like:\n\n* The Secret Life of Programs: Understand Computers - Craft Better Code\n* C++ Crash Course (could be very useful as a resource for next semester)\n* Write Great Code, Volumes 1, 2, and 3\n* Effective C\n* and more!\n\nI get absolutely no financial benefit from this offer.\u00a0 My benefits happen if you get the books and are better software developers from doing it.\u00a0 I must tell you, though, that I did buy the complete package, both to support the effort and to get access to some books that I might be able to use in teaching my courses or for my own personal development.\n\nThe offer expires on Monday April 5 at around noon: [https://www.humblebundle.com/books/learn-you-more-code-no-starch-press-books](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/learn-you-more-code-no-starch-press-books).",

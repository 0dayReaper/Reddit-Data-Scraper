    "postText": "I am currently taking CP at Conestoga to get experience for programming my idea is that I will drop it out after 1st year mind and do SET in fall of 2023 (mind you i got waitlisted for SET winter 2023 and while deadline hasnt passesed I doubt I will get in) however I am having my doubts on everything,I'm unsure of my abilities due to SETS hard reputation and the constant talk of drop outs and the need for co ops I have ADHD and learing disabilities which make learing very difficult and I am starting to seriously question if this plan would even be worth it from what I see on reddit CP/CPA is useless compared to SET but I'm having concerns on how good SET is compared to U of Waterloo I obviously don't have the grades for Waterloo but I keep feeling like I won't have any chance against them and especially if I cannot get into the co op I need advice from people who have finished the programs and can speak as a whole beacuse college seems to be a miserable option in general and I have no clue on what to do should I stick to my plan and then transfer credits to a university and try my luck with a degree,do SET and graduate,stay in CP,or something else.",

                    "comment": "I find that the responses so far have been good. SET is a lot of work, that's very true. However, having previous programming experience (as you do) helps a ton. You'll find that graduating from SET will make you prepared for mostly everything that you might want to do. I often say \"the only major company that we don't have a grad or Co-op student in is Facebook\" because we're definitely in the other AANG companies and a lot more :-). I know that you said that you aren't targeting FAANG but it's just an example.\n\nSomething to keep in mind is that, if you feel that you need a degree after completing SET, you can transition into Year 3 of the Bachelor of Computer Science degree at Conestoga through an agreement that we've got. So, you can get a SET diploma and a BCS degree in 5 years instead of 3 (for SET) or 4 (for BCS).  But that's only if you feel a need for it. You'll be extremely employable with the 3-year SET diploma.\n\nSo, don't stress out and just target starting in the Fall. There's room in the Fall intake (but not for the January 2023 intake, sorry).\n\nSource: I'm the aforementioned SET coordinator",

I know plenty of employers who don't look at institution name in this field but care about your actual skill set and what you bring to the table. This might be true for the top-of-the-top companies, but I doubt most people will ever work in FAANG if they knew the stress of such jobs.\n\nIf there is something that is being offered at Waterloo that is not being offered in Conestoga CS classes, lets say theoretical stuff then fill in the learning gap yourself. We live in an age where you can literally learn anything online, there are dozens of courses, certificates and coders out there that can help you get on track.\n\nOSSU for example has great material that helps fill in gaps that you might have. Stop stressing so much, focus on landing a co-op and the rest should be fine.",

I have lots of friends at wlu and they tell me im learning more in SET for first year than they were in their first year of their CS bachelors program so everything imo is relative. You would get the most success just focusing on whatever program ur in or qualify for and doing that to the best of ur ability",

Im not gonna theorize over what and where is better but id say that just doing something and being consistent is gonna get you the best results. Honestly, don\u2019t stress too much. Things will work out. CP is better than nothing and SET is better than nothing as well. Just do what you are able to do/ accepted for, give it your best and you will be successful",

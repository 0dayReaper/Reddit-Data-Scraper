I started working on my visa application and basically everything I needed to start my move and then 10 days later, they said it was a mistake and they revoked my acceptance. Is this something that happens and is there a way to appeal the decision?",

But what you're describing here sounds totally weird and off to me, so I think it's worth escalating it. I would first read all the emails really closely and any links they refer to, in case you missed something. If not, I would then look up some international admissions officers on the staff directory and (one at a time, two days apart, email the next if they don't reply) ask nicely if they could just do a quick check on your file, since your situation is a bit confusing, whether they could give you an idea of what was the official reason your application was refused. So you and your friends know for next time, you could phrase it. (Word of mouth / referrals are the main way international students hear about Ontario Colleges, and the staff know it.) You can search for staff under the department \"International Education\" - you can always ask them to forward you to an admissions officer, since titles aren't seemingly listed...",

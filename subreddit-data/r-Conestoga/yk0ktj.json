Explain why you switched (interest ignited for IT and waned for electrical etc.). Having strong SOP is always recommended anyway. So it's possible but the risk is present.",

Each course has its own page and all details associated. \nAnd for Visa, if your program is 2y you should get 2y study permit. Some of my friends got 20 months study permit just to give a heads up. Work permit you get after graduating and applying to IRCC so that should be 3y work permit. In total 5y of permit. Visa and permits are also different so you'll have to apply for visa after getting study/work permit",

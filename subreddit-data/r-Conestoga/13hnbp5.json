I see tons of information on the SET program but limited on civil and electrical. \nI\u2019m aware these programs require a lot of dedication for success, but I\u2019m curious for some information regarding anyones experiences with any of them, and how they translated to establishing your careers.",

Civil engineering deals with the design and construction of roadways, buildings, dams etc pretty much outdoors stuff. Electrical engineering I don\u2019t know much about and am still trying to find out.",

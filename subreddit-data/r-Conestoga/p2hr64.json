I am wondering if anyone would be making the drive from Guelph to Doon campus and would be willing to let me tag along with them. I would happily pay to help with gas. I would only be on campus two days a week Wednesdays and Fridays as it is mostly online. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso even if it was just one way that would be fine, I just can not make it to my lab on time with the public transportation but would happily just take it home need be, anyways thanks for your time and take care.",

All my courses are either pure lecture/theory, or labs which require me to be on a computer. \n\nWhat is the point of being in a classroom in-person with people, looking at one screen and being lectured, with my laptop and notes in-person, when I could be doing the same in the comfort of my own home?\n\nI only slightly miss being outside in the real world, but not enough to risk COVID exposure, my commute, and parking fees. All of that is a waste of my time during the semester.\n\nBeing at home is just objectively better for learning for my program.",

Even the semesters we were in person for, it was just a prof talking with us on our computers doing the things.  There are no labs that required anything, but our BYOD and internet.\n\nI don't want to have to commute 1h each way, pay for parking like once, maybe twice a week or risk COVID exposure.  It will be a big waste of time and money if we're forced to go back to campus.",

They made a post on the 21st; [Province endorses Conestoga\u2019s masking protocol](http://blogs1.conestogac.on.ca/news/2022/01/province_endorses_conestogas_m.php). So the goal is you go back to all classes on your timetable labelled in person. When you get there, you have to complete pre-screening, then are given a 3 layer mask that you MUST wear(they also update [FAQ about N95](https://www.conestogac.on.ca/covid-19/faq), saying that you must remove it and put on 3 layer mask given).\n\nI don't care if they have excellent ventilation if they aren't even giving out N95 to people; I won't be going to campus unless it's 100% needed. I'm not risking getting covid then having to put my house into quarantine and isolate for 10 days because they just want to get people back on campus. Most programs can be done remotely and should be left until PCR is given back to everyone and cases go way down, or they let us use our N95/they give out N95.",

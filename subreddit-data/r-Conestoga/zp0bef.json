    "postText": "I plan on applying to Conestoga for a bachelor's degree in computer science.  Tried to do some research but most of the posts were 3 years old and said that the program started in 2020. I wanted to know how good is the program compared to not the best universities but mid-tier universities like UofC, UVIC, or Dalhousie. I compared the subjects and they seem pretty similar to that university subjects, so it all ends up to how the profs are and how much output one can get out of the program. Also, 1 of my factors for choosing Conestoga is fees as the course is half the price I can get at a university.",

Really loving the degree and a lot of the profs I\u2019ve talked to are motivated to make it a competitive program between Waterloo. Ive also been in the comp sci program at Western if that gives me some credibility. Love the smaller class sizes.",

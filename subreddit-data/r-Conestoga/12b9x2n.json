If you stop now, you\u2019ll either regret it, or decide to go back when you\u2019re even older than you would\u2019ve been originally. Personally I should\u2019ve just done the nursing when I was your age instead of waiting. You\u2019re never too old to get an education if that\u2019s what you want. Good luck!",

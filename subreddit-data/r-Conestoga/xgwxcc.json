He asked me about Conestoga College and I was trying to look into.\n\nWhere can I find some statistics such as graduation/career related statistics. The program he is interested in is \"Software Quality Assurance and Test Engineering\".\n\nI am doing some of my own research into this as well. Appreciate any of your help!",

    "postText": "Does anyone have experience biking from Downtown Kitchener to Conestoga College Kitchener -Doon campus?\n\nAccording to google maps it is quicker than public transit and it could be nice to not be tied to a bus schedule.\n\nBut would a bike be stolen if left locked as securely as possible at the campus? Just seeing if this would be a possible way to commute to the college for some of the year.",

            "comment": "Definitely possible, there are a couple of routes, some are more pleasant than others, but at this point, there are several reasonably safe options. You can go via Homer Watson's new MUT. It's fine, the roundabouts can be a bit sketchy but you can avoid the one at Ottawa if you like by crossing 7/8 at Courtland Ave. instead.\n\nYou can also take the more scenic route down Wilson down through Homer-Watson park and along the Grand River. It's hillier and potentially bad in wet weather (although you can take Mill Park Dr. if the trail is too soggy).\n\nI've done both routes several times (on the way to Cambridge) but never during weekday rush hour.\n\nAs for bike theft, I have no idea if Conestoga campus is better or worse than UW. I parked my bike at UW for years and it was never stolen. But I had a cheap bike and an expensive lock and I never left it overnight. That's probably best case for avoiding theft. FWIW...the cheap bike is mostly peace of mind for me, it was no big loss if it was stolen.",

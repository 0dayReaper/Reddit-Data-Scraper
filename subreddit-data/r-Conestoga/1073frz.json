My marks are well over what they ask so I\u2019m just wondering if anyone has already heard or if anyone knows when they start to send those out. I am applying out of grade 12.\nThank you!",

I'm with [Ontariocolleges.ca](https://Ontariocolleges.ca)! \n\nThe reason you haven't heard about the pre-service firefighter program is because we are still before the equal consideration date of February 1. For highly competitive programs like this one, the colleges will not send out offers before that date. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCongratulations on your other offers and best of luck with number three!",

It's not like University where you can take literally any course at the school you're eligible for -- you just get to pick one from a list of a dozen or so. They range across a number of subjects, and are introductory-level. Keep an eye on your student portal, because I don't think I was ever notified that elective enrollment had opened. I just happened to find it on the portal one day about a month before classes started.\n\nI don't know if it'll be offered to you, but I took *Viewing Philosophy Through Film* as my elective, and it wasn't too bad. I was interested enough in philosophy to actually go to class and take the essays seriously, but if you really don't give a damn about philosophy at all I wouldn't bother. The essays would be tedious and annoying and you'd find the classes to be boring. Some friends took some nutrition course and said it was a breeze, so that might be better for you.\n\n&gt; What is my program like?\n\nI can't answer this question about your program in particular , but I'll tell you that the college feel is very different from University. Generally smaller class sizes with a more practical than theoretical approach to teaching new concepts makes for a more tightly-knit learning and socializing environment. You'll have more opportunity to work with your classmates on things, and more opportunity to get closer to your professors/instructors. \n\nAnother big difference is that you take more courses at one time at Conestoga College than you do at University. Because of this, you might find work piles up at times.\n\n",

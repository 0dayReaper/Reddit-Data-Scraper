To be honest Laurier or University of Guelph would probably be the only the schools around this area of  to accept a transfer considering the ridiculous levels of competition for CS and Software engineering in the University of Waterloo, however it is still possible, if u really feel like Laurier or Guelph would be better. Ok but I do not see much of a difference considering that the guys who made this CS program also designed the Software Engineering program in conestoga which is a top tier program that produces many successful students",

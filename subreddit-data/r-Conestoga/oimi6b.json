    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nIt would be amazing if anyone can help me navigate this issue. One of the conestoga professor is not assessing our assignments. This professor keep giving us assignments but is not grading even one of them. The problem is all these assignments are part of one big project and we are working hard but we don't know if we are going in the right direction.\n\nThis professor handles two subjects in our class and has not graded even one assignment.\n\nEvery other professsors grades assigments within a week maximum except for this one.\n\nWe want to bring this to the concern of the college but don't want to come in the bad book. Is there no ADMIN of Conestoga who keeps an eye out on professors and whether they are checking assignments of students? No one to check what professors are doing?\n\nPlease if any officer of Conestoga is present here , you need to have a system to evaluate whether professors are grading their students assignment on time. We are paying a huge amount of fees and we need to know assessment of our progress.\n\nthanks",

Sounds fair. \n\nI am concerned if professors activities are monitored at all? \n\nAny one in this college monitors where they are taking their classes for full duration? Or do professors wrap classes as soon as possible? \n\nOf course, assignment assessments being the paramount concern.",

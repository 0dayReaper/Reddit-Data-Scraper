Marks aren't TOO bad, but definitely not an 80-80+ avg. \n\nI'm almost positive I won't get into co-op, how bad is it? Is there any other chances, 2nd semester, or second year? \n\nI've heard good marks don't really matter in college, but I've also heard the opposite. That you just need to pass and you're good to go...but also heard that employers, if not all, look at you're performance",

            "comment": "Im in this program and was able to make coop with GPA of 3.6 last year. it's only available for first years unfortunately. Unfortunately, just passing will get you no where and nothing fast. I'd change that mentality if you care about your future at all. (Sorry if harsh just trying to be honest) it's a tough world out there and you need to know your shit. ESPECIALLY ELECTRICIANS. The fact that you are in an electrical course where you're doing work that could really harm yourself or others, is concerning and maybe you should look for an alternative career if you're just not into electrical? It's a very challenging field and you can't just bullshit your way through it. As for getting coop, it's very competitive for grades, as well as there are fewer spots available than previous years due to covid and available positions. Last year they said they had to decrease the number, and then there were still students that made coop who didn't even get a placement. It's unfortunate but if you are enjoying it enough I would stick with it and try and get an apprenticeship after school. That is the ultimate goal afterall. Best of luck with the rest of your schooling.",

The program is designed as a pre apprenticeship program to help you get your foot in the door. The odds are much higher if you can get into the coop. To just get out there and start getting your hands dirty.",

However, I did a lot of research prior and asked around a lot and Conestoga has one of the more respectable programs for sure. The profs are amazing and everything you learn is very useful and prepares you well to apply for apprenticeships after school. Yes I would say it is a good chance to get an apprenticeship out of this program if you know your shit!",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been debating it for a long time, and I\u2019ve decided that I want to go back to college to get shit sorted out. \n\nI dropped out of Mohawk in 2018 because I felt that the field I was taking would not be my best bet for employment. From here, its just been about decisiveness. \n\nI\u2019ve narrowed my interests down to three fields; \n\n\u2022 Psychiatry \n\n\u2022 Computer Science/Programming \n\n\u2022 Accounting.\n\nSince I\u2019ve heard that Conestoga provides online courses/programs that are meant to get people started. I need to know; which courses are the most likely to help me get accepted back in?\n\nMy goal would be to try them out, test the waters and see what happens from there.",

I did it before COVID when it was in-person though, so I'm not sure if there were any major changes other than the program being online now. YMMV, but it might be worth looking into!",

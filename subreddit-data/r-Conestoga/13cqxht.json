    "postText": "Hello CC Community,\n\nI recently started a new job as a faculty member in the school of business and have my first classes this week. Looking for any tips or advice you have as current/former students or staff. \n\nWere there any activities your professors did in the first class that helped the class to bond and your professor to get to know you? Also curious if there were things your professors did that you really enjoyed or found helpful throughout the semester. Similarly, I also wish to learn which things are considered cringey or generally hated by the class. This is an anonymous post so nothing needs to be held back. \n\nMy first class this week is a general course overview, but later classes include a major group project and a focus on advanced MS Excel modelling. This semester I will have only in person classes, but I likely will have some synchronous online classes on top of my in person in the fall. \n\nThanks!",

Because there was no way I could possibly survive in the course because of my disability fair in mind, my disability happens to be strictly physical They happen to be the coordinator of the program I took this as a major FU to me and did exceptionally well in the program going into the second year, I decided that the program wasn\u2019t right for me fearing I wouldn\u2019t get employment at the end,and went into something else. The coordinator actually cried when I left I\u2019m hoping that she realized how much of a jerk she was.\nBoy was I wrong\nFast forward three years my friend also with a disability, the same one as mine ended up, coincidentally in that same program with the same coordinator and it was a repeat performance on the part of the coordinator, bringing them in before school, etc.. I finally had enough and went to the dean of the college who literally said we don\u2019t want to deal with it because we\u2019re intimidated moral of the story, don\u2019t judge a book by its cover, neither me or my friend ended up finishing that program so basically the coordinator won by association",

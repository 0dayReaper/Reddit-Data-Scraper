Only issue is that there is not much student amenities and extra curricular activities going on at Waterloo, but all of the tech based programs are there, so some clubs like the google developer student club host their events at the Waterloo campus. I can\u2019t really answer If it\u2019s better than Doon campus because I think that\u2019s subjective. To me it is just because of location, but doon is the main and largest campus.",

All computer science programs, hospitality, &amp; I believe carpentry (?) are at Waterloo. All of the other trades are only at the Guelph campus. Everything else (except for engineering I believe) is at Doon. \n\nSource; I\u2019ve gone to Conestoga for bartending &amp; biotech, partner went for diesel mechanics, &amp; I\u2019m going back again to finish my biotechnology bachelor\u2019s. Conestoga sucks at explaining the campus divisions.",

I doubt it's a good option.\n\nLots of online courses/programs offer better content than this program. The biggest advantage of blended/on-campus programs, you can talk with a tutor face to face. Especially for newbies, some silly configurations and problems may be stuck whole day, and for experienced dev only 10 minutes to resolve the same issue.",

Maybe online stuff will work out better if I were to do it along with in-person classes who knows \ud83e\udd37\nAt this point I just wanna jump in full time",

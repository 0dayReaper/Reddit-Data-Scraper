    "postText": "Hey! Yesterday i got accepted into the courses i applied for at Conestoga. Those being:\n\n\\- **Bachelor of Computer Science (1514C)**\n\n\\- **Software Engineering Technology (Optional Co-Op) (1132)**\n\n\\- **Computer Programming/Analyst (Optional Co-Op) (0057)**\n\nI am not very familiar with the complex difference between the 3 of them. I understand the differences in classes and content between the 3 but not really where I'll end up. Also the Bachelors is a 4 year instead of a 3 year like the other two courses.\n\nJust wondering if anyone has been though any of these or has any insight of which is best for someone looking to become a software engineer after school.\n\nThanks.",

With Software Engineering Technology, you must compete against the other students in your cohort for a co-op seat, as it is not guaranteed and only the top 40 students (I think) get co-op.",

I've met with Computer sci students in GDSC group and its a good option too. Computer programming students? I've never seen any of them around, plus SET has had a reputation for a long time now, you're basically becoming the boss of someone doing Computer programming. \n\nHowever its not a bed of roses, with the recent job market and increased intake of students, the reputation for these programs is being affected. You might not find a job if you're not building yourself up, aside for college work. College work is insufficient but a good starting point. \n\nGood luck OP with your program selection.",

None of these programs are magic bullets that will get you a job. \n\nIf you slack off in school, SET isn't going to help you any more than CPA would have, since you're not going to be able to get through an interview. \n\nAssuming you put equal effort in, and don't pursue any outside reading, SET will likely give you better programming chops, and you'll have a better understanding of how a computer works at the end of the program.",

Real life exp &gt; license/certificate, you need to prove your experience rather than a paper.\n\nSo, in this case, I never heard any immigrants have said, they need certain program to be qualified as Programmer/Developer etc..",

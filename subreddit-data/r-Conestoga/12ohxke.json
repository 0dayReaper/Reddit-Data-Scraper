No matter how tempted you are PLEASE don't send anyone money until you are signing a lease. Every year so many people get scammed and this year has been even worse with the prices for a bedroom in a shared house 1000$+.",

Especially if you\u2019re unsure and don\u2019t want to get ripped off. I think it\u2019s around $7000. For 1 year. In my opinion this is ur best bet to not get totally ripped off by bad renters. Especially if you only need this temporarily. \n\nAcademic accommodations: \nCheck out Conestoga academic accommodations. You\u2019ll hv to submit proof you have some sort of disability like an IEP used in school previously. Meet w an advisor. They\u2019re super nice &amp; will help you out",

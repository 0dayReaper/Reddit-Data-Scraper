    "postText": "Long story short, I'm in a class that everyone is doing really poorly in. I've recently learned that the other professor is giving their students \\*much\\* more detailed test review sheets. For example, we have \"long answer, \\_\\_ marks\" and they have \"long answer regarding this specific concept where you will be asked to create a chart comparing these specific terms.\"\n\nI'm having a hard time feeling like this is fair at all, especially considering my professor has acknowledged how poorly everyone does in her class and something like this could make a huge difference.\n\nAnyway, among other similar reasons, I was going to message my program coordinator and ask what can be done, aside from dropping it and extending my studies a whole other semester for one class. Does anyone have experience with this and can share what the outcome was? I'm stressing hard because the drop deadline is quickly approaching.\n\nMy average right now is 89%, so I'm not a bad student. But the expectations in this class are ridiculous.",

            "comment": "Get some students together and speak with your coordinator about this, explain exactly why you think it is unfair.  Back in 2011 I think it was we had a professor come in mid semester who taught at the University of Guelph.  Not that she did not know what she was doing but she taught it like a uni class, and we were not used to this.  Bad/no communication, missed classes on her part that students would show up for and nobody is there, and 90+% of the students were doing very poorly.  Our coordinator listened and we actually sat down as a group, professor, students and the coordinator and worked out a solution.  This was CP/A 10 years ago so I am not sure how much has changed, but if you are serious and can find other students who are also invested in this it's worth a shot.",

            "comment": "Hey there! something similar has happened to me in the past! there are many avenues you should pursue to rectify the issue. Have you sat down and talked with your professor first? could you access the other classes' notes to show the differences? if that step got you nowhere I'd go to your program coordinator then. if things still don't change you have a right as a student to appeal course work. just google student rights and responsibilities Conestoga and the first result should be the office's website. Another route you can take in this process is if it's only you appealing, someone from Conestoga students Inc can also step into the meeting to support you. At the end of the day course delivery differs from teacher to teacher. I had a course in my third year where it seemed like the teacher for my class was a much harder marker and had twice the expectation then the other block, but looking back I learned a lot more on the subject then I realized.",

I'm planning to apply for SET of Conestoga and I have some questions.\n\nI'm also planning to apply for BCIT CST and UBC BCs program.\n\nSo, I took some Math and English programs that are equivalent to grade 12 high school students at Thompson River University which is in BC.\n\nI'm curious Conestoga accepts that kind of thing?",

I didn't get accepted into SET when my math + English average was in the high 70's, but did get in once it was raised into the low 80's (Winter 2020 intake). However the competitive average might be different now.",

The program has gotten incredibly popular in the last two intakes, which would tend to increase the cutoff as more of those with better qualifications apply.",

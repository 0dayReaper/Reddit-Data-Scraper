I\u2019m good at planning my time, and I study smart, not hard, so I don\u2019t really find anything too overwhelming, just want to see if I can plan to work full time while doing this program. Thanks in advance!",

Id say part time work is ok but full time work could be problematic, however you said u dont find anything too overwhelming so you might be able to work full time and manage it. I worked like 25-30 hrs max a week and I found the course load to be ok. I didn\u2019t finish the program so idk about anything after first year as I switched to a different program.",

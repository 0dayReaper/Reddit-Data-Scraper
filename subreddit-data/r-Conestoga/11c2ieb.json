I don't think they can give you an academic offense without a warning. \n\nI had a situation where my prof thought I cheated but I showed them how I got the answer and explained my thought process. I also showed them the textbook I learned it from and they figured I actually didn't cheat so they didn't report it.\n\nI'd suggest talking to your professor.",

There\u2019s a cafeteria to eat at the campus, a library, lots of computers to use and space to study. \n\nGetting a job is kind of on you and how you access the services and the demand for the program you e chosen. The college has employment supports that you can use that will help you job hunt and send you leads to apply to. This is a good way to get started and the Kitchener campus is in the heart of the city so you can connect with lots of local businesses while you go to class.",

I\u2019m having cold feet now as yesterday at my brothers work kids from Conestoga came and told their experiences. Overall having to hear what I heard from them I have lost that excitement i had. Can someone please give me a talk or anything.",

When I applied, I called HR departments, asked about salary bands, qualifications, and demand. People were really nice about it, and I got a ton of good info and advice from the HR managers (but was always respectful of everyones time. They are doing you a favour, after all. Keep it short and just the absolute essential questions. Be ok with a brush off, and call a few places). Is this a diploma program? Will you be competing for jobs against people with full degrees in the field?\n\nFor certain things, conestoga is THE place to be (namely, supportive healthcare roles like nursing). For advertising I couldn't possibly tell you.",

There really doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a community on campus as a whole, but there are probably people in your program you can connect too. I know I did which felt surprising that it wasn\u2019t just me but yeah. People have been accepting with lgbtq+ in my experience.",

I'm on the cusp of finishing my degree program and I've never felt like the school had much of a \"community\" to speak of. There are some clubs and events you can join but in my experience not a lot of folks pay attention to or attend them.\n\nFind some nice folks in your program in first year to be friends with and try to keep that going as best you can.",

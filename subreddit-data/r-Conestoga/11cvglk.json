    "postText": "Looking to go to Conestoga soon but I need a laptop now. I was hoping to get a laptop now that would last me at least a few years in college but the minimum requirements for a laptop in the Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours)  (1514C) program seem unreasonably high. Do I really need to worry about meeting the minimum requirements? also the requirements say that it has to be windows 10 or newer. So I can't do Macos?\n\nThank you in advance",

Otherwise, you\u2019ll struggle a lot in keeping up due to compatibility.\n\nAs for system requirements on Windows machines. I\u2019ve got an ASUS ZenBook(UX370U), and it\u2019s done well for me up until having to use virtual machines. You could definitely cut corners in terms of performance, but assignments may become unnecessarily tedious.\n\nSource: 0057C",

There are few students with Mac who use CLion instead of Visual Studio and in Windows some use VS while some use CLion. My point being don't worry too much there are people with i5, i9, Mac, etc.\n\nEdit: This suggestion is only if you're in like 1st sem because I don't know what happens later.",

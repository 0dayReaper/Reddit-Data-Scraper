            "comment": "Students who don't get into SET co-op still get decent jobs but it usually takes a bit more effort and the salary isn't as high (since you don't have the work experience). What I typically recommend to non-Co-op students is to build up a good portfolio of work that is outside of your normal course work (since everyone is doing the same assignments and differentiating yourself is very helpful). Then, once you start your job search (likely in February or March), treat it very seriously (once you're done your exams, then treat it like a full-time job).\n\nSomething that I recommend as \"a good portfolio outside of your course work\" would be to contribute to open course projects such as what you'd find on GitHub or sourceforge.",

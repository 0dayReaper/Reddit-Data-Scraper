I'm with [Ontariocolleges.ca](https://Ontariocolleges.ca)! \n\nThe people commenting in this thread have covered the main points: \n\n* \\- If you're an **international student** who has not already paid for and submitted an application - Conestoga is no longer taking applications, but paid applications are still being considered. Please submit all evaluations ASAP. \n* \\- If you're a **domestic student** who has paid for their application - Conestoga is still taking applications for domestic students. Please submit outstanding documents ASAP. \n   * If you're still in high school,let guidance know you're applying and they'll submit your grades at the appropriate times. \n   * If you're out of secondary school, please order your transcripts.\n   * If you're upgrading a course, make sure to submit a grade as soon as it's available.  \n   * Please visit our website for more information on submitting transcripts. \n\nIt's common not to have heard back about next September yet, as we're still before the equal consideration date of February 1. If you don't hear immediately on February 1, that does not mean you have not been accepted - some programs take a little longer to hear about. \n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck!",

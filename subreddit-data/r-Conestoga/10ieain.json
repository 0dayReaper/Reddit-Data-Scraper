Unless you arrive after your session begins, then you have to register before arriving, i did it before arriving but people who came here with me did it after they came to college. Its not a compulsion but its good to do if your course expects many entries and you might not get a seat. Idk about your course.",

So, right now, thousands of students are in the system for the Spring semester with Pre-registered status. \n\nSource: I'm a Coordinator.",

I had my admission and seat reserved in computer animation and motion graphics (January 23 intake) course since July 22 and had paid my full fees. Even after I landed in Canada in January my portal showed that I wasn't registered. When I went to the admissions department in college, they told me that the admissions were full and that I will have to change course now. I did everything from my end on time and submitted all the documents but my admission was still not confirmed after classes started too. I went there everyday for help but each time they'd tell me it isn't in their hands and that they'll try their best. Someone told me to reach out to CSI and they actually helped me get my admission back and I have started in the course I got admission in since 2 weeks now. I suggest you send an email to CSI as well, see if they can help you out. I talked with Rachel from CSI.",

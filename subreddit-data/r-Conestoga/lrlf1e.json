Now I have a laptop that meets the requirements except for it's a 13inch screen where the program says it should be 15 or larger, should I contact the course administrator or would it be fine?",

You will find working on a 15\" screen much easier than a 13\" screen but I wouldn't recommend buying a completely new laptop solely for screen size.  Instead, as owlsquadblessup (aside: it always amuses me when I see reddit handles for students that I've taught) recommends, get an external monitor for use at home.  I have a wide-screen LG that I got on sale for around $200 two years ago.  I see that [bestbuy.ca](https://bestbuy.ca) has a 29\" LG at 2560x1080 resolution for $280 (regular price) that looks very similar to mine.  Personally, I recommend a second monitor no matter what.",

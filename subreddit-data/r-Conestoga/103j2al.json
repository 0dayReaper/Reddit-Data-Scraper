    "postText": "So I applied to conestoga Bachelor of Comp SCI last year and got accepted (I've also applied this year ) . However I decided to stay back a year to get some grades in some classes back up for 12th grade as I wasn't happy with them. What would be the chances that If I contact the college if my offer could be re-instated from last year?",

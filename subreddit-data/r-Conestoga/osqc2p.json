    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI (M) am looking for roommates (unisex) with whom I can co-lease and split the rent of a townhouse. I am taking Mechanical Engineering Technology - R&amp;A (Cambridge), however this post is directed to anyone. I have my own transportation and am happy to carpool if practical.\n\nMany listings within a reasonable radius of the Cambridge campus (according to [rentals.ca](https://rentals.ca)) have a rent anywhere from 1500-2500, however the ones nearest to the campuses are around 2500. Split 3 or 4 ways, this is very manageable. Many of these listings are unfurnished however I have some stuff of my own I can share (table, chairs, dishes).\n\nI (like to think I) am a reasonable roommate and I like to keep my living, bathing and eating quarters relatively tidy. I only request a combined effort to maintain shared spaces.\n\nThanks for the consideration and feel free to message me privately as well as commenting.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019m a Canadian applicant. I was trying to apply to the virtualization and cloud computing program but it doesn\u2019t show. So I called today because they were not answering my emails and the lady said its already closed for May intake. Is there any chance I can apply to the program through the college? I really need to take the program in the spring term.\n\nPlease advise!",

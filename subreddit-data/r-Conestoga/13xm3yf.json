    "postText": "Under Invoices, i\u2019m looking at the optional fees. What does the CSI event fee cover? Is it to join clubs or attend events? Is it worth paying for and is it a one time payment or is it to be payed with every invoice?\n\nAlso what is the CSI student could and societies fee? I really wish they would provide a description to each of these fees so I know what i\u2019m paying for.\n\nPlease let me know, thanks for the help :)",

            "comment": "CSI student club and societies fee allows you to join clubs on campus while the event fee allows you to attend various events that CSI holds throughout the semester. The fees are included in every invoice, I think the frosh kit is the only optional fee that is only paid in the first semester of the year.\n\nEvents range from weekly trivia, live music, various workshops, talent shows, and more. Whether or not it's worth it depends on if you think you will attend any of these events. They are a great way to meet and build connections with other students on campus that aren't in your program, but if you aren't going to engage in any events, then I guess it would make more sense to decline those fees.\n\nYou don't have to worry about being locked out of events permanently if you initially decline and then later change your mind. There's always the option to pay the fee through the CSI store after the fact.",

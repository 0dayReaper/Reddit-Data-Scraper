In that sense, it's not a traditional Conestoga campus, which is probably why there is little information about it.\n\n[Here's](https://virtual-tour.conestogac.on.ca/conestoga/village-at-university-gates) a link to the virtual tour on Conestoga's website. It's a relatively small campus since it operates out of a portion of the long-term care home.",

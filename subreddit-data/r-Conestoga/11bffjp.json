    "postText": "Am I screwed for getting into Conestoga?\n\nHi, I am wondering if there\u2019s any chance of me getting into Conestoga in fall 2024. I\u2019m currently enrolled in a different program at a different college. Last semester I failed 2 classes and had a really low GPA. This semester my GPA has improved and I\u2019m passing the failed classes with no less than a 90%. I\u2019m simply not enjoying my program and I want to switch to Software Engineering Technology. I am planning on withdrawing after this semester. Im going to take a year off to save up for it and also take courses on TVO ILC to get better high school grades. Will I have a chance to get into any other college let alone Conestoga? Thanks for the help :)",

Talk to admissions and find out if the marks cut off for admission this year was different than what is on the website (they are wonderful people, though be aware this is their busiest time of year and be respectful of their time, or wait until June).",

When it comes to placements, what regions/cities does Conestoga partner with?\n2. How is the course delivery, is it all in person/a mix of both/ all online?\n3. Do we have to purchase scrubs from the school or do we/can we purchase our own?\n4. How would you describe your experience and any advice for people starting out?",

            "comment": "My answers are based on my experience in the accelerated program at UG.\n\nSites might be subject to change next year but so far this year the placements have been as follows for the accelerated program at UG:\n\nSemester 2 placement is either at Schlegel Villages LTC or Guelph's Continuing Care/LTC unit. Placement is one day per week for 15 weeks (12 hour shifts) with a 6 AM start time.\n\nSemester 3 placements are at Grand River Hospital (surgical and medicine floors), St. Mary's (Surgical and medicine floors), Cambridge Hospital (rehab floor) and Stratford General (surgical). Placement is one day per week for 7 weeks. Placement is 12 hours but start time is dependent on site.\n\nI believe Semester 4 placements are at all of the above sites. You will work the same schedule as your  supervising nurse educator which could include weekend shifts, weekdays, overnights, etc. You will be working full time (unpaid).\n\nCourse delivery is entirely in person save for any electives you choose to take. Electives might be online or in person depending on the course. Most people I know have their electives online.\n\nYou will have to wear a Conestoga PN scrub top + name tag at minimum which is purchased from the bookstore. The nametag is really flimsy so be delicate with it. You can wear your own watch and bottoms but the bottoms must be black to match the Conestoga PN uniform. Your shoes must also be either black or white and non-slip certified with no mesh. \n\nExperience so far has been good but it's a challenging program. Make sure you know how you study best and make sure you feel confident enough to be comfortable in uncomfortable situations and to seek out knowledge on your own. The LTC placement is intense and getting adjusted to the schedule and setting can be difficult if you've nevrr been in it before. The Pharm tests in Semester 1 have very strict passing requirements so make sure you focus a lot in that class and do your absolute best, especially if math isn't your strong suit.",

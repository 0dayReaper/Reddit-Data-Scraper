            "comment": "I honestly think the non design courses in Bachelor of Design have been a waste of my time and money, especially since most are 3 credit courses with less than 3 hours of instruction scheduled per week. Why am I paying for 3 hours when I only get 2 or maybe even 1 hour of instruction? Also we keep getting saddled with totally inexperienced instructors.",

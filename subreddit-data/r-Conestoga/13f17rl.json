    "postText": "Can anyone that has been in the PN program at Conestoga lately give me an idea of how long class days typically are? I know it\u2019s a heavy course load and I fully anticipate that it\u2019s going to be challenging but I\u2019m trying to get an idea of how often I\u2019ll be at campus as I live in Guelph. Any thoughts on the program are greatly appreciated as well! I\u2019ll be starting in September.",

Can you tell me about how many hours in addition to in-class you spend completing assignments and studying? on the conestoga website if you divide the hours by the weeks it says 24 hours a week in class. Im trying to figure out if the extra hours you mention are completing work, or if the course hours on the conestoga website are just total bs. I believe you over the website, haha.",

It all depends on what you want out of the program and your ability to learn. People I knew who had no plans to further their education put in the bare minimum. Others study longer just to get by. Some people want to pursue further education after this so they study more.",

    "postText": "Ive made the fee payments back in March, uploaded my visa and even confirmed invoices and ONE card. But my fees and deposit still show as pending in the admissions portal. \n\nI got emails from Conestoga saying they've received the fees and the same appears in the fee section, but my application status still shows pending. I reached out to the admins and they said that it'll only reflect in August since my course start date is in Sept. Is this the same for everyone?",

There are a few more students that are in the same situation as you, and the issue has been forwarded to IT and the Student Fees teams. I\u2019m not sure how long it will take to be fixed, please continue to monitor your applicant portal for updates.\n \n&gt;Your patience is appreciated while we work to resolve this issue.\n\nHonestly the student portal is so incredibly glitchy. its like a 40% chance I can even log in to it at all.\n\nedit: I just checked and mine has been fixed, and its showing deposit as paid now. It took about a week after contacting admissions.",

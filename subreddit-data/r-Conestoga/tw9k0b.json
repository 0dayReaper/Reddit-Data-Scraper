I understand your frustration. Even tho its kind of a general thing that academic IELTS is for studies, they should have mentioned Academic nonetheless. But its their fault so I guess they'll have to do something about it. University of Alberta is much superior tho, even York University is much better, if you have an acceptance letter, i think go for them.",

Toronto is 12 hours behind my timing. So I called and it was still no answer since many of their administrators are working from home. I am thinking is it the IELTS general is not accepted and they insist on academic results? But no reply after I sent in my enquiry to them. I can always take up another test. Btw, my IELTS general is for creating a express entry account with IRCC, my results is as follow at 2021: \nReading: 8\nSpeaking: 7.5\nListening : 8.5 \nWriting: 6.5\n\nOverall band is 7.5",

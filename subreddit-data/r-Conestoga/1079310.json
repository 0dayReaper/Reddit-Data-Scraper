    "postText": "Hey everyone. I have applied for web development program in Conestoga Doon campus(haven't got the LOA yet). Just need some clarity on choosing the Conestoga campus. Doon or Waterloo campus which is better in regrad to student/social life, part time jobs?\n\nI heard that doon campus is kinda isolated from the Kitchener city, is it so? And waterloo city is better with many University students and crowd. And so the social life and part time jobs are better over there compared to Doon campus?\n\nAppreciate your reply :)",

            "comment": "You heard right lol. \n\nDoon is nice and has a lot of amenities on campus, but it is quite literally at the edge of Kitchener with not much of anything around it. It's fine if you are just looking to go to class and get your schoolwork done, but kinda boring if you're looking for anything else.\n\nThe waterloo campus is close to the universities and not too far from uptown waterloo, so the social life aspect is definitely stronger. There are a lot of part-time jobs available around the area, and even if you get a job a bit further away from campus, the commute to and from would be much easier at waterloo than doon.",

I heard that in doon campus there will be many college fests and events. Is it same with the waterloo campus?",

It's the largest campus that Conestoga has, and frankly they need all the events because students would probably go crazy without them lol.\n\nThe rec centre offers a lot of different activities in terms of sports and exercise classes. There are also various CSI events like trivia nights, dances, live music, etc that are held often in the on-campus bar called The Venue. There are also quite a few clubs and volunteer opportunities that can help you build connections with others. \n\nIt is what you make of it. If you go out of your way to attend these things, you'll have a good time and meet new people, but you have to put in the effort. These events aren't always at the most convenient times. Depending on where you live, getting to campus can be a real pain, so a lot of people won't attend these events unless they line up with their class schedule. \n\nThere's also more variety of food options on the campus compared to other campuses, but it still pales in comparison to the number of food options around the waterloo campus.",

I live in Kitchener and don\u2019t mind heading up to Waterloo for classes cause as you said it\u2019s much more lively with the universities being on the same street and how close it is to food places, conestoga mall, gyms, clubs &amp; bars (if you\u2019re into that), and just other cool stuff in general.\n\nI\u2019ve lived in Kitchener my whole life and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever even been around the Doon area (besides driving past it) cause there is nothing to do there besides conestoga lol. \n\nBasically you\u2019ll have a better time socially in Waterloo in my opinion, and yes doon is pretty isolated from Kitchener and Waterloo.",

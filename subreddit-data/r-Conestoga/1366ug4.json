    "postText": "If you are taking this program, let me start by saying it's an amazing program through the school. Rene and Adrienne had a tremendous impact on my life. \n\nIf you are taking this program and are interested in tools and the needed book for the program at a discounted price I have both for sale, specifically for students going into this program. \n\nThings that are included, tools have been used for a year in the trade, and all tools are cleaned but in used condition:\nTextbook of Canadian Masonry. Updated. (mint condition, not drawn in or highlighted), essential for the program. \nToolbag, great condition and size.\nSet of Mason brushes \nBrick hammer \nBarrel jointer \nPointing trowel \nBucket trowel \nWheeled Raker \nMetric tape \nVariety of slickers \nVariety of cut off slickers \nMetMod tape measure \nLine blocks and string \n4' level \n2' level \n\nEverything from the curriculum is included in this bundle. Everything except a brick trowel, you will need to buy one, as I am planning on keeping mine as a 'souvenir' and there are many trowel options so it makes sense you pick one up you like. \n\nLooking for 275, I believe that this is a fair price as this was about the value of the text book. And you will easily be saving $400 in the tools. Please DM. Willing to drop this off to anyone in the area of the school for free.",

Basically I made the mistake of googling college reviews and I came across a lot of posts on r/Kitchener about the college being, let\u2019s just put it not that great. I know everyplace will have negative reviews and not everyone\u2019s gonna get a good experience even out of the best institutes, but I can\u2019t help but wonder if I\u2019ve made a mistake. Id like to know if you guys have had good experiences (I just wanna feel less awful)",

For the position that you're in now, though, I'd recommend getting in touch with current students or graduates of your program and get their take on it.",

This is, objectively, one of the best colleges in Canada.\n\nIf you want to have a great experience, put in the time and energy. The students who are successful are the ones who show up (physically and mentally), the ones who prepare before the lessons, the ones who participate and ask questions to learn, not to look smart, the ones who interact with their classmates positively, and so on.\n\nAs a student, I had some grievances, none of which are deal breakers.\n\nAs a teacher, my only grievance was that students expected success without putting in the work.",

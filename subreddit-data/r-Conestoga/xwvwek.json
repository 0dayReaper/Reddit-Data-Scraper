Which I originally thought was great, but I don't feel confident enough in any of them to apply to jobs.  I'm probably going to take another program focused on the job/sector I want.  I'd recommend taking something more focused if you want a job straight away, but ITID is good to figure out what part of IT you'd like.",

You'll have to keep learning on your own since this course only teaches the basics of development and designing",

Most of the assignments you will get is just a google search away lol.\n\nSubmit your assignments in time and revise well for your exams. Should be easy.\n\nMake sure you dont give up on your job search and learn new languages/libraries in your free time.",

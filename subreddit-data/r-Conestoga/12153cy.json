Or only just a couple classes to make my marks high enough to get into my next program.",

            "comment": "I'm also finishing up pre-health! I think that's a question to ask admissions at Fanshawe, but generally they would take your most recent education history for your admittance averages for prerequisite courses. You may be able to take chem101 and bio101 (or similar introductory courses) at Conestoga over the summer and improve your grades for the classes you need.\nIf they want you to specifically do the pre-health versions of chemistry and biology, you might have to retake the programme. Talking to the programme coordinator Claudia might also help give some insight into your options. \nGood luck! :)",

Most colleges will likely only look at your pre-health marks, but I'm going into Laurier this fall and they did also look at my high-school transcript. \nMost specific healthcare programmes will only really look at your pre-health, but some broader science programmes may look at high-school too if they don't \"like\" that you're coming from college. Again, it's pretty dependent on where you're applying, so I would ask them what they like, because I barely got into Laurier for sciences and I have a 95% avg from pre-health. \nA lot of universities are pretty... uptight about people coming from college, they tend to look down on college education, unfortunately. That being said, I know Guelph, McMaster and Trent have no issues with pre-health from Conestoga!",

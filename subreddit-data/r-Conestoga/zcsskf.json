I started my program with all Indian international students and idk if any of them ended up with a professional job. Most people just do the program to get PR and then idk what they do.",

My brother plans on getting PR too but he will be returning back to the university to do a course he is interested in or to further in Business. For now his focus is to get PR which I just hope he can get with the general business diploma.",

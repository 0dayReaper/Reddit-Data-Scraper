    "postText": "I've never been to college before and I've been accepted into a full time diploma program at Conestoga. I'm excited and nervous because it's been a while since I finished high school. I have a few (perhaps dumb) questions that I am unable to find information on online. I would appreciate any guidance.   \n\n\n1. How many hours of classes happen in a day? \n2. Is 5 courses a term too many? \n3. What are electives and how do they work?\n4. What is something you would advice I do to prepare to have a good experience?",

            "comment": "1. Depends on what schedule of classes you want. Time management is what I love about post secondary. You can choose a hybrid of inclass and online.\n2. 5 courses a term is not a lot. I think I had 6 courses in my 1st sem and 7 on the 2nd and it was very easy to manage when you get to pick your own schedule. It depends on the person tho if you prefer to work a lot and study at the same time you can choose part time study. I worked 2-3 days a week in my 1st year and it was fairly easy.\n3. Electives are courses you can choose outside of your chosen program.\n4. Be yourself, I guess... there's a lot of international students and I assure you you won't be left out since there's a lot of adults returning back to school no matter what their age are. Don't let a 1% quiz that u forgot to do let you down. Always remember or make a list of your quiz/assignments/test due dates.",

But general post secondary advice I have is to just roll with it. Focus on your studies, and time management is KEY. It is only hard if you don\u2019t allow yourself the necessary time you need as an individual to get things done in a timely manner. Engagement in classes makes it so much easier to focus and immerse yourself in the work. I find if you don\u2019t participate in discussions, and fully engage while learning and studying, things are blurry and like a foreign language when it comes time to do exams and major assignments! Have fun too!\n\nWhat program are you taking? I\u2019m taking ECE.",

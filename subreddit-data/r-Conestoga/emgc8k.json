I just moved to Waterloo on Tuesday for a program starting in Winter, not sure if there are other people here in similar positions that check here. But I'm hoping to connect anyway even if you have been here or in the area for a while. Some of my interests are anime, music, movies, tv shows, walks and hikes. Feel free to pm me or post in the thread to connect with others.",

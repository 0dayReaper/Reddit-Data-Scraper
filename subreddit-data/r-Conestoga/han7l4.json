    "postText": "Hey everyone! \nI\u2019ll be starting the IT Innovation and Design program in september 2020, and though we won\u2019t exactly be on campus, i still wanted to try to meet other ITID students. This subreddit isn\u2019t the most active, but it was the best thing i could think of. \nIt would be awesome to have a Discord server where we can help each other with our courses and get to know each other. I don\u2019t really know how to make a server lmao but if there are enough people who see this, I\u2019m sure i can figure it out. Or we can just have an instagram gc if there are only a few of us. \n\nI\u2019ll start by introducing myself!\n\nMy name is Jessica, 18, she/her. I was in Waterloo Math for the 2019-20 school year but realized it wasn\u2019t for me, so i switched to ITID. Some of my recent interests are Ace Attorney, Animal Crossing New Horizons, Inuyasha (sequel soon!!), and some of the recent shorter shows on Netflix. I also like to draw occasionally. \n\nI hope we can all be friends! :D",

You guys are probably going to have a orientation or something like than (again on zoom).\nYou can suggest the idea of having a group chat with all your class mates (on facebook, WhatsApp, discord, etc.) In one of your early classes or the online orientation.\nOr you can make a server a week before your class starts and just send the link to others on one of your classes.\nYou can also post on Facebook group (conestoga has a few Facebook groups) and ask if there's anyone from your program. That's what I did before my first year and met some people from my program!\nGood luck on your studies girl!",

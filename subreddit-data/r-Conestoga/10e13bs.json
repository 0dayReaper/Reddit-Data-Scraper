    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm currently at the start of my supplementary applications for the Game Design course and I'm feeling a little overwhelmed. Is there anyone here taking Game Design that has any advice on websites to use for portfolios? I only really have a handful of little concept games, most of it is either drawings or pixel art.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated, thank you!",

            "comment": "You could try making a static site and hosting it with GitHub Pages for free. There's a lot of static site gens out there like Jekyll, Hugo, or Publii (the easiest IMO). These gens make simple blog like sites. If you don't know any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, you don't want to learn it, and you need a highly customized site then you're better off using a drag and drop service like Squarespace. You'll probably have to pay for hosting though",

Recently I've completed my portfolio review recently and got acceptance within 4 hours, so in my opinion you just have to explain your previous works and game concepts you have properly.",

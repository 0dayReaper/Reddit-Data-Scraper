We're a newer chapter (founded in thebeginning of 2021), so our atmosphere isnt one of intimidation; however we do have traditions that are passed down through our history as an international sorority founded in 1917. If you have any questions or would like to see more, check out our insta! We would love to welcome girls from Conestoga, University of Waterloo, and Laurier. Our rush season has just started, and we would love to see you there! \ud83e\udd0d\n\n[Kappa Beta Gamma - Beta Epsilon Chapter](https://instagram.com/kbg_be?igshid=MWI4MTIyMDE=)",

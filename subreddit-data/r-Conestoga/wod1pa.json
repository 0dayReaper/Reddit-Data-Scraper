    "postText": "So I\u2019m enrolled for a business management program in the next couple of weeks and the college said they\u2019re providing a laptop for it. I\u2019m fairly certain it\u2019s a Windows laptop but I\u2019ve been a Mac user for the longest time now. \n\nIs there any particular reason why the college would recommend using Windows over a Mac for a Business Management program?",

Not only that, but they would only have to diagnose problems related to Windows laptops as opposed to needing to have a tech specialize in both OS'\n\nWindows is pretty nice, hope you pick it up well!",

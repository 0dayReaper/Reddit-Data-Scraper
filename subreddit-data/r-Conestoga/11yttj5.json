Both are costly. \n\nYou can try using wise.com - it gives a good rate, but you\u2019ll have to bring money to your own account here and then send it over to your college somehow (debit card has limits, they might not accept checks, etc etc)\n\nYour best bet is to talk to the finance / registrar and ask about how payments can be made from Canadian accounts.",

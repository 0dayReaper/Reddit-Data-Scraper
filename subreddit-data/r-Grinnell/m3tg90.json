Congratulations on getting in, Grinnell is very lucky to have you.\n\nI unfortunately am not the person running the group, so I'm not sure entirely too sure, but if you have a Facebook account, I believe that you should be fine as long as you request it.  They probably will be able to match your Facebook profile and name to your real name.\n\nAll the best!\n\nHave a nice day!",

For example, here's a picture of one of the loggias at Grinnell for the South residence halls: https://digital.grinnell.edu/islandora/object/grinnell:4941\n\nSouth's allows you to connect all the South residence halls together, which makes it easy to go from dorm to dorm and see other people.  You can also easily post advertisements for events in the area, park bicycles, etc.\n\nI currently live in the North side of campus, and ours is similar except unlike South's loggia which is kinda like a building, ours is connected to the outside: https://www.grinnell.edu/spaces/gates-hall\n\nI am really bad at describing these honestly, which I am so sorry for, but I found this article on them, and I hope this helps explain some of it. https://www.grinnell.edu/news/lovin-loggias\n\nHave a nice day!",

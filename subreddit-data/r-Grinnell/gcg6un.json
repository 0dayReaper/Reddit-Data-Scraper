            "comment": "This is very long, but I hope it\u2019s helpful. \nI never stayed in a gender specific dorm, so I can\u2019t speak to that. I never had a problem living on a coed or gender neutral floor. Each semester, the floor votes on how they would like to deal with bathrooms. All four years I lived on a floor with a gender neutral bathroom, a women\u2019s bathroom, and a men\u2019s bathroom. I used both the women\u2019s and the gender neutral interchangeably. \nI\u2019m not sure there are too many unspoken rules. I was there at the time when a group of students held a funeral for self-governance\u2014the administration has become a lot more involved in students\u2019 lives and I think that has resulted in less self policing by the students, which I find very sad. \nMy first year, I was very much not friends with my roommate. My second year, I lived with a dear friend who eventually left the college, and then another of my friends unofficially moved in because he\u2019d had some trouble with a small room and a difficult roommate. Third and fourth year I lived in singles. \nI don\u2019t know very much about sub-free housing; I always stayed in the most sub-full dorms I could find lol. However, I had a number of sub-free friends. When I visited them, I found that their dorms were very quiet and possibly less social than the others\u2014but I know that they were trying to organize more sub-free activities, so this may have changed. I also knew a few non-sub-free folks (frequently they were \u201csub-lite\u201d) who lived in substance free housing because they wanted a quiet dorm.\nI lived for 6 semesters in Loose, and 1 semester in Cleveland (1 semester I was studying off-campus), so clearly you can tell my preferences lie with south campus. Broadly speaking, south campus is seen as the place for artists and free spirits, east is for the quieter types, and north is for athletes. (Certainly this is not a rule! All types of people live on all sides of campus.) Even though I\u2019m a bit of a homebody and sometimes was annoyed by the loud late-night partying in Loose, I liked being close to the action. East is objectively the nicest part of campus, with AC and just really nice-looking dorms. By comparison, south and north are a little more run down, but that never particularly bothered me.\nI\u2019m an abled person, so I can\u2019t give you all the details on how disabled folks are treated. The office of diversity and inclusion (I think) helps students get accommodations to help with their classes. One of my friends was dealing with a very serious chronic illness, and I know it was very hard for her.  \nI\u2019ll conclude by saying that I\u2019m very unique in having lived in the dorms all four years. Many, if not most, fourth years will live in apartments, especially on High Street (party row, basically).  I really liked the Grinnell dorm culture, but some people could not wait to get their own place.",

Honestly, the woman and I ended up having the most problems\u2014we simply did not get along. The two others were my friends, and we got along swimmingly. Ultimately, for me, gender has little to do with it. I think that was the experience that most of my friends had. However, if you\u2019re uncomfortable sharing a room with someone of another gender, I would go with your gut. You can always room with someone else next year!",

I think I\u2019ll sign up for either gender and just see how the cards fall, either circumstance seems agreeable to me. I would hope not many of questionable character would be admitted in the first place.",

            "comment": "I found living on an all-mens floor to be pretty obnoxious first year, but my floormates were a particular mix of obnoxious. Besides that I have never heard of any issues with gender-inclusive housing. It's pretty much a nonissue. \n\nI would say that having a good relationship with your roommate is great, especially in first semester. Me and my roommate chose each other, and I would recommend you do the same. Ive seen some great random pairings and some awful random pairings, and I think its better to play it safe. Most of the people I know are friends with their roommates, in fact I would say that your roommate, as well as the people who live in your hall first-year, often form the nuclei of your social life especially in the first year. \n\nI would say that unless you are strictly opposed to the use of substances (not just for yourselves, but for others too) I would not recommend living in a sub free dorm. Most of these are in east, and honestly east doesn't have much of a community. Its very quiet and sterile, and you can get noise complaints pretty easily in some buildings. I think living in East makes it harder for people to make friends, and there is definitely less of a \"Res Life\" feel. I live in Cleveland, right next door to James. The James kids (or Jamesies as everyone in south calls them) have formed their own kind of clique and play board games every Saturday night. Its pretty cute. I am friends with people who are sub-free, and I don't look down on people who do not partake but generally people who choose to live in sub-free dorms are 1. quieter 2. more sheltered. I think a large part of first semester is meeting new people so I would say avoid those dorms all the way unless you are a major introvert or are uncomfortable with drug use.\n\nSouth all the way. Its kinda grody, but as long as you don't end up in the pits it is fine (I did). There is definitely more of a community in South than anywhere else on campus, but it gets rowdy and stays rowdy on weekends.\n\nGrinnell is radically accepting. The school will do its best to accommodate you. One of my friends struggled with severe depression throughout all of first semester and her professors did a lot to help her.\n\nThe one thing I would add here is do not take online courses at Grinnell. So far they have been not good. I have been able to keep decent grades, but feel like I am wasting my time and learning little. I would advise taking a gap year if you can instead of straight matriculating into online courses. \n\nBut anyways welcome to Grinnell! Most people love it, I know I do. If you have any other questions or just want to chat I would love to hear from you, pm me!",

I have to commit by May 1st, and am totally freaking out as I already committed to Kenyon and did not think I\u2019d get off the waitlist at Grinnell. Also, I know pretty much nothing about it lol. Has anyone else been accepted into the same program?",

Because it is pretty late now to get a good amount of scholarship, Grinnell will not give you the scholarship as good as Kenyon. Should you make sure to cover a large amount of money for Grinnell, I think that would be fine.",

            "comment": "My son graduated with a CS degree last year.  Great professors, super opportunities.  He was lucky enough to get an internship at Google between his 2nd an 3rd years and an internship with Nest between his 3rd and 4th years.  He was the only intern from a liberal arts college.  The others were from engineering schools.  Though these internships were paid, Grinnell has a program to give students who get an unpaid internship a stipend so they can take advantage of those opportunities.\n\n\nGrinnell College is a challenging school.  The town has little to draw people away from the college, so the college has a lot of activities, speakers, and events.  It also has transportation to Iowa City or Des Moines most (every?) weekend so students can get to a city to shop or eat.  All activities (sports, concerts, speakers, theater) on campus are free to attend.\n\n\nGrinnell College men's basketball is kinda famous for the amount of points it scores.\n\n\nRight now, about 18% of students are from other countries.\n\n\nThe study-abroad options are numerous.  My son spent a semester in London and loved it.\n\n\nI've eaten in the dining hall...  Good options (Grinnell has a lot of vegetarians and vegans, so those options are easily available) and the food is quite good.\n\n\nAnything else you'd like to know?\n\n\n",

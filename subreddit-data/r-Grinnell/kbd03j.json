    "postText": "I am a native Grinellian who is in 8th grade at the local middle school in town. Unlike you guys, we\u2019re still having athletic events. On the bright side, protocols are in place to ensure the safety of the players, fans, refs, and coaches. These include wearing a mask at all times and markings on the bleachers to promote social distancing. I personally think we shouldn\u2019t have had close contact sports like football, but let sports in which players are distanced, such as volleyball and cross country go on. Right now, Poweshiek County\u2019s numbers are the lowest of any county in the state, which allows Grinnell to keep playing. What do you think the school should do?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kbd03j)",

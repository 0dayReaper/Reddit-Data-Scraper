Grinnell ranks very highly in producing phd students in biology, chemistry, and physics, and fairly highly in engineering even though there\u2019s no engineering program here, though I expect that\u2019s just the result of our CS department (which is awesome!). This is no coincidence. The small class sizes and lack of grad students mean plenty of undergrad research opportunities for proactive students, and most science majors have a pretty heavy emphasis on engaging with contemporary research by their 4th year. So unless you\u2019re particularly interested in ME or EE, Grinnell\u2019s a great choice. Though for those students Grinnell does have a 3+2 transfer program set up with some great schools you could read about [here](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/majors-and-concentrations/physics/3-2-engineering-program).",

However, just being in Grinnell, IA where there just isnt as many resources available outside of campus (hospital is super tiny) is something worth considering.",

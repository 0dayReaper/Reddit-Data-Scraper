    "postText": "Hi there, \n\nThe billing agreement form provided for new students asks if they permit Grinnell to use so called \u201cfederal title IV financial aid funds\u201d for prior year tuition, fees, room etc charges \u2026.  \n\nI\u2019m unsure how I should answer this question as I was under the impression that said fund were only given to US citizens? Is this the case or are international students also given federal tittle IV funds?! \n\nThanks in advance",

            "comment": "I went trough that form already and just came into conclusion that my response does not really matter. The Title IV refers to the federal funds, which as far as I know, never amount to the financial aid package for international students. Because of this, the federal funds given to international student will never exceed the expense of room, tuition etc, since they have never been given in the first place.\n\nGood thing that you can always amend decision regarding those funds. \n\nHope that helps!",

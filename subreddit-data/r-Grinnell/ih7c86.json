I believe that in order to be a transfer, you have to be a rising sophomore or a rising junior, so if you're over 2 academic years, it may be a tough call.  I would reach out to the Grinnell Office of Admission as I'm sure they would be able to help you out in your specific situation.\n\nGood luck!\n\nHave a nice day!",

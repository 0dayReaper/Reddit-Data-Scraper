I\u2019m very devastated, but I am hopeful that they will open again soon. \n\nIf you are a person of color, a lot of us travel to De Moines during the weekends to get our hair prepared properly. \n\nI would not recommend 1st impressions. It\u2019s convenient for a quick and unhealthy blow out, but many of my friends were disappointed with their hair cuts.",

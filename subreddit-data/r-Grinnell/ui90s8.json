I did not submit any of my test scores (SAT, ACT, AP)\n\nMy unweighted GPA was 3.81 and my weighted was 4.61\n\nMy ecs: I was my school's sailing team captain and I sailed all 4 years. I volunteered for 3 years. I played piano. Taught myself guitar for 1.5 years and I think that's it\n\nI have no idea what part of my application got me in though.",

            "comment": "I was accepted RD. I applied test-optional. My weighted GPA was about a 94. My academic record and the rigor of the classes I took were pretty spotty for Grinnell's standards\u2014a decent amount of B's and a couple of C's as well and I only started taking AP coursework junior year. While I did have extenuating circumstances, I 100% think that my essays COMBINED with my extracurricular involvement is what got me in. That's the key word there\u2014don't think of them as separate entities, they complement each other. Anyway...\n\nFor ECs I was captain of my school's debate club, editor of the lit magazine, MUN for 3 years, and started choir this year. Outside of school, I had leadership in a couple political organizations and did a lot of policy writing work and volunteering. I also did music\u2014classical piano for 8 years (music is one of the biggest parts of my life for sure), guitar/songwriting for 4 years. Hope this helps!!",

I don\u2019t think anybody here minds helping but please don\u2019t let the stress of the process get under your skin. \n\nGPA: 3.6UW // 4.1W at a competitive, small, magnet school\nTests: 1380 SAT\nECs: 450+ hours of self-led community service, full household responsibilities, football management &amp; line assistant coach for 3 years, school choir for 2 years, FBLA for 3 years, and a teacher-assistant internship for one semester. \n\nDon\u2019t hesitate to reach out to current students for help with this process &amp; make sure that your application gives a clear-cut picture of who you are as a person. Couple that with applying to schools that fit what you\u2019re looking for and simultaneously are looking for students like yourself and you\u2019ll end up where you\u2019re meant to be :).",

            "comment": "So I applied RD and got in off waitlist. (If you are waitlisted, make sure to send in a letter of continued interest, it might work wonders!)\n\nMy school graded 100 scale and I was like 104/105ish with class rank of 3/160ish. I also took a lot of rigorous classes like 10 APs throughout HS and 2 college classes. I also taught myself 2 years' worth of math throughout HS so I was taking higher-level math classes.\n\nMy Extracurriculars: social justice/activist work, played piano, held some leadership position in various clubs, won a couple math competitions, worked for a local non-profit for 5 years, I also submitted my art portfolio\n\nGranted, I'm white and grew up in a fairly rich area with a lot of academia culture so I did have a lot of advantages going into this process.\n\nA bit about Grinnell:\n\nYou can see how the admissions process and what Grinnell values transfer to the student body. Everyone here is super interesting and passionate. We all come from different backgrounds but share this love for learning and engaging with our community. 10/10 school, definitely would recommend. \n\nThat being said, the stats game can only help you so much in this process, It's all fairly unpredictable. I got rejected by some schools much \"easier\" to get into than Grinnell and into \"harder\" to get into schools that I wasn't expecting. No matter what though, I want you to remember that you will be okay. Worst comes to worst, transferring is always an option.\n\nI wish you the best of luck!",

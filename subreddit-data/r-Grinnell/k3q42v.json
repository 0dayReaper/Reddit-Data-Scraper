They stated that it was necessary to apply before Dec. 1 to be considered for merit scholarships\u2014 although this was never my plan, I thought why not apply earlier than the regular deadline.\nDoes anyone know if this means my admissions decision will come back earlier? The website states it will be mid-March... any thoughts or experiences with this are greatly appreciated! Thanks :))",

It came out March 13 last year, so it\u2019ll likely be a similar date.\n\nGood luck, and I truly hope you get in!\n\nHave a nice day!",

I don\u2019t know how common this is, but I applied RD to Grinnell and submitted my admission before Dec. 1st to be considered for merit scholarships, and I actually got my admission result in early February, around a month before general RD decisions were released. Even though I applied through regular decision, I got my result early, and although I don\u2019t know exactly why, I have thought it may be because they want to alert some students about their admission earlier, so that students can attend earlier campus visit sessions, in case the school thinks that the student may be competitive/less likely to chose Grinnell without additional incentive. \n\nBest of luck!",

Though English is not my first language and I didn\u2019t attend any English medium schools, they waived my EPT. I didn\u2019t even ask for it. After that, they emailed me twice for my financial aid form. Is it a green sign?\n\n And as an RD applicant, I don't have any \"Why Grinnell Essay \" in my portal. Should I mail the admission office about the essay?",

If   \nyou have then they automatically waive your EPT (this is my assumption). I didn't ask   \nfor it too but I also got a waiver, probably because I attended sessions and spoke to a   \ncurrent student/intern at the admissions office. \n\n3) If they've emailed you twice for the financial aid forms, I don't think it's a green sign,   \nquite the opposite because they like to have all parts of your application submitted   \ntogether. You should submit your financial forms ASAP. But don't worry, it's not a   \nblunder.\n\n**All the best with the college process :)**",

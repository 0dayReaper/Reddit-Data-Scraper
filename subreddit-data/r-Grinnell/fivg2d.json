    "postText": "Hi, I just received my acceptance to Grinnell yesterday. From what I've heard about the classes and environment, I feel like I would enjoy it there, but I feel nervous about being able to meet the rigor of classes. My stats are a 4.26/4.4 UW, 5.28/6.4 W (My school's grading system is weird) and an SAT of 1370 (630 ERW/740 Math). I've taken a total of 6 AP's so far, and I'm taking 3 this year. Received 3 5's and 3 4's so far.\n\nRegardless, I'm majoring in Computer Science and was wondering what the rigor of the classes is like there, and if I can even fit in, given that my SAT for ERW is lower than average.\n\nAny feedback would be appreciated, thanks!",

A little bit of advice though, don't go into college knowing what you want to major in. If you do you tend to blind yourself to other amazing opportunities. If you want to major in CS that's fine, but make sure you get the liberal arts education you deserve. (Also, in the spirit of shamelessly plugging, you should join mock trial)",

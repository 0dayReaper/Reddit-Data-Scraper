    "postText": "Hello! I've got a few questions as someone who's thinking about transferring - I just finished my first year at a pretty big university and didn't feel like there was as much community as I wanted, nor student/professor interaction. I'm looking at small liberal arts schools like Grinnell  and the flexibility in study is really appealing to me. So, i've got a few questions:\n\n1) What's your favorite thing about Grinnell?\n\n2) Would you agree that people are intellectually curious and that there's a strong sense of community?\n\n3) How confident are you in being financially secure after graduation?\n\n4) Lastly, how likely is it that I will get a scholarship/grant as a transfer?\n\n5) Anything else! \n\nThanks so much for helping a random stranger!",

Choose a major that has financial potential if that's what you are concerned about, and network with Grinnellians (board of trustees nights, alumni from your major, etc.)\n1. No idea. I think transfers get financial aid just like normal applicants, but I'm not positive. \n5. Doesn't hurt to try transferring, does it?",

Do you guys have any advice? For now, I've requested to join the 2023 facebook group and I'm gonna scope out clubs to figure out what I want to join. Let me know if you have any general tips/advice about Grinnell as well. Thanks in forward :)",

I thought you might wanna take a read if you're still deciding between dorms!\n\nBest of luck!\n\nHave a nice day!",

            "comment": "The political atmosphere is very liberal. At the caucus, something like 40% of the students went for Bernie, and maybe another 35% for Warren. I'd say substantially more than half the student body supports some form of socialism or social democracy. That said, it's a lot more tolerant of more centrist views than similarly leftist institutions; I worked for the Buttigieg campaign, and although I personally consider myself a socialist, the general perception of Pete was that he was much too centrist. While there were plenty of people who argued with us on policy, it was always very respectful, and I've met exactly one person who in any way fits the stereotype of the \"Bernie Bro.\" Everyone else was pretty great. That said, right-of-center views are pretty difficult to express, and while plenty of people identify as conservative, they almost never speak out on politics. \n\nDouble majoring is pretty simple, no matter the subjects; the open curriculum makes it pretty easy. It definitely limits your freedom, but if you care about your subjects it's no biggy. I don't know anything at all about math, but my experience with the philosophy department has been excellent. In particular I would wholeheartedly recommend Professor Cummins. \n\nCreating a club is pretty easy, as long as you can find people interested in joining. I know someone started a circus club this year, and got substantial funding from the school. \n\nI've heard nothing about any trouble with townspeople. Everyone I've met has been super friendly and welcoming; they all seem to have a very positive attitude towards it or ignore it completely. I did a lot of outreach as part of my campaign work, and Grinnellians as a whole are some of the nicest people I've met. \n\nHope this helps! Feel free to message me with any more questions you might have; helping out prospective students is actually one of my favorite things to do.\n\nEdit: sorry if any of that was incoherent, I'm pretty sleep-deprived\u2026",

            "comment": "Hey, I'll try to answer your questions as best as I can! To shed some light on my perspective, I graduated in 2017 and I transferred to Grinnell as a second semester second year.\n\nI don't consider myself to be a super politically active person. Overall the political atmosphere was very liberal, and many of the students were very politically active and passionate about politics.\n\nThere were a lot of people I knew who double majored in unrelated subjects (one of my closest friends double majored in bio chem and classics.) The way that students get to choose what classes they take makes it pretty easy to do so, and it seemed like the school encouraged diversity in class/major selection. I didn't take any philosophy classes while I was there, but I was a math major. I thought the math department was great. The professors were all wonderful and always helpful. There's also some good opportunities for research projects.\n\nI didn't really participate or try to start clubs/organizations, so I can't really speak to that question.\n\nSome of the townies are not very big fans of the campus and how liberal it is. I never personally had bad experiences with the townies. When I was there I heard about a couple of incidents like townies driving around campus and in town with Confederate flags in the bed of their truck. There were also some townies who were driving around and harassing some students walking through town and I believe when the students responded they jumped out of their car and were threatening to kick their asses. Nothing happened beyond the threats. Those are the only incidents I remember from my two and a half years there, so it wasn't a common occurrence and I never felt unsafe while I was going to school there.\n\nHope this helps and good luck with your application!",

I'm hoping to as well!  Maybe I'll see you around in a Philosophy class.\n\nHave a nice day!",

            "comment": "Grinnell is actually great for doubling majoring in opposite topics, because of the lack of distribution reqs. Math/Music here! The only distribution req they have is a certain number of credits outside your major division (science/social science/humanities), but if you double major in 2 different divisions, those count for it.\n\nAlso I had only great experiences with most townspeople I met. I lived in the town off campus for a while, and it was fine. I did hear of some incidents of teenagers in town harassing students, but nothing major, just bored teens.",

            "comment": "Grinnell is a *very* blue campus. I agree with the first comment in that regard. I remember hearing about a Young Republicans club (or something similar? Can't remember the name) being started. It ended very quickly.\n\nI don't think it's hard to double-major in unrelated subjects, as long as you know pretty early on that that's what you want to do. I have a friend who's double-majoring in Physics and Philosophy. I could try to connect y'all if you like? \n\nI don't think it's super hard to make a new club, people do it all the time. I remember a \"cheese-making club\" getting pitched at the budget meeting last year, though I'm not sure how much attendance they got, haha. Granted, in recent years, the rules governing clubs have changed a lot. \n\nI'm wondering what you mean by \"aren't big fans of the students\" and who you heard this from? Not attacking, I'm just genuinely curious. The only things that comes to mind is this: I'm a black student. While I was thinking about getting a bike, I was warned by someone on-campus not to go to Bikes to You in town 'cause apparently the guy who owns it is hella racist. Other than that, I haven't actually had a bad experience with the townspeople. They seem pretty nice! I see some of them at Grinnell events sometimes. \n\nHope this helps! \n\n\\-a rising third-year",

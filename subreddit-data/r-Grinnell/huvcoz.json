The link takes me to a Microsoft login redirect and when I enter the info it says my account is temporarily locked to prevent unauthorized use and that I should try again later or contact your admin. Does anyone know how to fix this?",

If you are on Firefox, I recommend trying it on Google Chrome, Safari, or Microsoft Edge.  If that doesn\u2019t work, I recommend calling Grinnell IT when they are open.  They helped me fix it!\n\nGood luck.\n\nHave a nice day!",

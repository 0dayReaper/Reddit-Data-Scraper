    "postText": "Hello! I would like to write a letter of continued interest to Grinnell. I was waitlisted and it is my top choice. I didn't know that I was supposed to show continued interest before (distance learning can make it slightly harder to know these things haha), so I hope it's not too late! Could a letter at this time still help?\n\nAnd should I update them on new things I've been doing this year, even if I'm not sure that it's significant? I don't have any new test scores or accolades to report. I spoke on a panel early this year a few days before submitting my Questbridge application (it was due super early), but I didn't mention it on my application. \n\nAlso, do you have any clue why students get waitlisted? Could it be a concern that they wouldn't fit into the community, or simply that their application is less strong than students who were admitted? \n\nPretty much my entire application references programming, but frankly that's all I focused on in high school. It introduced me to a lot of different experiences though, so maybe I'm well-rounded in a different way? At Grinnell, I want to explore other subjects and find positive applications for computer science. I'm thinking about addressing this in my letter too.\n\nHaha, I realize I'm asking questions that you all might not be able to answer, but thank you for hearing me out :) Any input is helpful.",

From here on, you have nothing left to lose. So write whatever your heart wants to tell in that letter, be it about the college, about your career, or even about what you want from the college experience! Just keep in mind that you're still writing a loci",

I provided my name and email when I registered, so is it possible that Grinnell will keep that information and consider that I missed a meeting when I apply?",

So many things to do and not nearly enough time. I thought junior year was supposed to be the hardest but senior year is kicking my bu\\*\\*. They are offering it again in a few weeks...here is the date Sunday, Oct. 16 @ 6 p.m. CDT",

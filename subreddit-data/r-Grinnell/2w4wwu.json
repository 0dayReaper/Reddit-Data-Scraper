    "postText": "Hi everyone! I was exceptionally lucky about two weeks ago and discovered that I had been accepted early into Grinnell - Grinnell is essentially my dream school, and I was beyond excited! I would turn in my deposit now, but I am sort of stressing about the possibility of the school rescinding my offer of admission based on my senior year grades. I still have time to bring them up, but I currently have a C in AP Calculus and a B+ in AP Biology (I received a B- and B+, respectively, for those courses last semester). I am typically an all A student, but I decided to challenge myself this year by going out of my comfort zone with AP science and math courses. I haven't given into senioritis (the lowest grade apart from these that I have is a 96), I am just really bad at math and science. Do you think there is a high possibility of Grinnell seeing these grades on my final year transcript and deciding to rescind my offer of admission?\n\nThank you for reading and possibly responding to my stress-induced rambling :)",

Colleges would only revoke offers of admission if you drop from straight A's to D's and F's, and even then I'm sure it's rare. Plus, you're taking the most difficult classes, dropping a little is normal.\n\nJust relax and look forward to going to Grinnell, where math and science classes are not required!",

I know north campus is supposed to be a lot of partying and sports teams and south campus is supposed to be a bunch of hippies/stoners, but could someone give me a little more detail if they don't mind?",

            "comment": "Those stereotypes are accurate enough but definitely don\u2019t apply across the board. Anyway, you\u2019d probably also do well to know that East Campus is generally quiet and hospital-like\u2014a good place to live if you take sleep and studying seriously.\n\nI\u2019ll just tell you what I can recall off the top of my head. As far as North Campus goes, Langan Hall is a neat dorm. That\u2019s where I lived my first year (in 2012) and I made quite a few friends there. A lot of rooms had exposed brick and a nice aged feel to them. Younker and Norris Halls are on opposite sides of North Campus, but both had a fairly familial vibe. Gates, Rawson, and Dibble tended to house a lot of jocks, but they\u2019re really comfortable even if you\u2019re not an athlete. Cowles is a unique little part of campus and includes newer, more modernized rooms and facilities.\n\nI can\u2019t speak to much of South Campus other than Loose and Main Halls. They\u2019re both on the larger side and accommodated lots of parties while I was there. I lived in Loose my final year and the location is central to everything. If you can put up with a little noise on weekends, it\u2019s pretty ideal. It\u2019s just a stone\u2019s throw from the JRC, where the dining hall, a few classes, study spots, and events are found. The laundry rooms in the basement of Loose are nifty as well. \n\nIf you have any other questions, I can try my best to answer them : ) but I hope this helps!",

I\u2019ve lived in all of them and imo the air conditioning in east is worth the quieter atmosphere. The stereotypical first year building is Norris, which is at the end of north.",

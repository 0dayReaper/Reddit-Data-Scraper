            "comment": "my interview was so nice and really not that stressful! I don\u2019t remember exactly what questions my AO asked but we did talk about my favorite classes/teachers from high school, what majors I was interested in, and what drew me to Grinnell. There may have been one about what I liked/disliked about my high school. He also asked if I prefer cake or pie! It was more like a conversation than being interviewed really. Because you\u2019re doing the interview before they get your application (I assume), they really just want to get to know you. This also means you can spend a lot of time talking about your extracurriculars and stuff and you won\u2019t be telling them stuff they already know!\n\nFrom my experience, grinnell really likes students who really like grinnell. So be enthusiastic, smile, think of questions to ask, and don\u2019t worry too much! Good luck!",

            "comment": "I worked as an intern at the admission office, and, while I did not conduct interviews myself, I believe I can give you some insights. The main purpose of the interview is not about academic, but to understand what type of person you are and what you add to the Grinnell community. The questions will likely be personal, maybe about favorite classes, projects, passions, why Grinnell, etc. If I could give very specific advice, if you have any particular passions, highlight them in the interview and make sure to be yourself! The process is quite laid back and is not meant to feel like an interrogation but more like a friendly conversation, so try to be formal but not too formal. \n\nAs someone else responded, be enthusiastic, smile, and ask questions. Remember, even though this is an interview to know what type of person you are, it is an opportunity for you to see if Grinnell is the right school for you. It is also one of the few instances where you will be able to ask either a current student intern or staff (many of which are Grinnell alumni) personal questions (so ask questions!).\n\nIn any case, try not to stress about it a lot, as it is not a large part of your application. Hope this helped and good luck!",

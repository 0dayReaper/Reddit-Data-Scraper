    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm going to be attending Grinnell next fall and first year tutorial registration just opened up. I was wondering if anybody had any recommendations for professors that were particularly good (or ones to avoid)? I am currently thinking about taking a class taught by Professor Cummings or a course taught by Professor Sinnett. Does anyone have any experience with either of them as tutorial teachers?\n\nThanks in advance!",

My professor, who I won\u2019t name, would actually tap a fake coms lapel button to talk to our class sometimes. But I learned so much about writing, composing and resenting my arguments, and speaking, and it was such a worthwhile class. So, remember that even if you don\u2019t get your top choice, it will still be valuable. \n\nAnd if George Drake is offering one, you have to make that your top choice. That man is a legend and as close to a perfect human as I\u2019ve met. He just wrote a fantastic book about Grinnell alum Joe Rosenfield, but don\u2019t read it until you\u2019re a few years into Grinnell. It\u2019ll be so much better once you recognize the names and places he describes.",

            "comment": "I might suggest avoiding Professor (assuming it's still Joe? I'm fairly old) Cummings unless you're really into the material of the course. He's brilliant and extremely kind, but not a very engaging lecturer or leader of discussions. Those things are pretty important for one's tutorial.\n\nHave a great time at Grinnell, and welcome to the community!",

Make sure you're looking at the right one if you're looking up feedback about them!",

We all met up at her house for dinner once a year or so afterwards. I'm still really close friends with several of my classmates, too.\n\nI would generally suggest picking one that sounds interesting, and not focusing too much on the professor. I don't think there's a professor out who is universally liked or disliked. Especially with tutorials, a lot of it is a matter of your personality matching well with the professor, so take anyone else's recommendations with a grain of salt.",

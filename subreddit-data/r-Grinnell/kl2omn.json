    "postText": "Hi guys!  \nInternational here who is considering ED 2 to Grinnell.  \nI studied under the British GCSE system. I'm applying to the US but my situation is tricky. During my O levels, I had 8 subjects including Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Maths, English Language, English Literature, and Sociology. These are the equivalent of the first 2 years of high school in America. My cumulative GPA was around 3.5-3.6. I come from a low-income background, and I've had to deal with a lot of issues at home that, during that time period, made it quite difficult for me.  \nAlthough over the course of my A levels I have improved. These are equivalent to the final 2 years of high school in America.  \nHere, I had 4 courses: Sociology, World History, English, and Economics. I received an A\\*, A, A, and B.  \nClass Rank: Economics: top 40%, World History: top 10%, Sociology: top 20%, English: top 3% School does not provide overall class rank.  \nI gave the December SAT and received a 1370.  \nI have a substantial number of ECs. Notably, I have written and presented my own research paper on the deficiencies of the public schooling system in my country. During my O level years, I was student council president and continued to be a student council member as well as captain of the Model United Nations society during my A levels. I have won an international award at the Harvard Model UN in Boston. Moreover, I've worked extensively with a local NGO for the empowerment of girls' education in my country, as well as having co-founded a public cleanup campaign. Lastly, I'm also a published contributor to a well-respected news publication in my city.  \nMy EFC would be about $5000, unfortunately, this is all I can muster. I know that Grinnell does meet 100% need, but I don't know how generous the school really will be. I really like what Grinnell has to offer and I feel I would fit in well. With this in mind, should I still apply or look elsewhere?  \nAny feedback is welcome!",

            "comment": "Hey how's it going. You're stats are on the lower end but yourextracurriculars are really interesting! Unfortunately Grinnell is not need blind for international students so your low EFC might hurt you. I'd say it's a toss up on your chances and really up to how the admissions committee feels about you. I'm no expert but dince it's a toss up I'd say ED 2 would help your odds. Definitely apply but I'd also recommend applying to other schools that you'd be interested in attending. \n\nIn regards to financial aid I had a similar EFC (I'm the only earner in my household since both my parents are in jail for bestiality related crimes). The school really does meet 100% of need and recently announced that all loans would be replaced with grants next year. Also if you apply ED but can't afford a school you should be able to get out of your ED agreement as long as you communicate with the school--so I wouldn't let financial fears stop you from applying ED. \n\nIf you're sure that you want to attend Grinnell ED 2 seems like a good option in your situation but if it doesn't work out making it clear to Grinnell that you will attend if accepted can provide a similar boost. It's a wonderful place with great people and great squirrels! Hope to see you on campus someday and best of luck with your applications!",

            "comment": "Hey, OP!  I hope you are doing well!  \n\nFirst off, I wanted to second the other commenter!  They gave a lot of great advice.  Unfortunately, it is true that Grinnell is need aware for international students meaning that they do factor your financial need as they make an admissions decision meaning that it will be more difficult for you to get in if you ask for a lot of need based financial aid.  Unfortunately, this is the case with most schools for internationals as only Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Amherst, and MIT are need blind for internationals.  However, if you are accepted, they will meet your full demonstrated need, and beginning 2021-2022, Grinnell will be going loan free in financial aid, which means you will get some extra need aid without having to pay any of it back.  If Grinnell is your top choice school, then you should probably go for it as Grinnell considers demonstrated interest in the process, and ED2 is a great way to demonstrate some while finding out your decision earlier.  In addition, in the unfortunate but rare scenario if you do end up getting in ED2, and they require you to pay over your EFC, you are allowed to leave your ED agreement, and this applies not only for Grinnell but any university you ultimately decide to ED2!\n\nGood luck with your application, and I truly hope you join us at Grinnell!\n\nHave a nice day!",

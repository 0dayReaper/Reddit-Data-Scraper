    "postText": "Hi guys. I was recently admitted to Class of 2024 as an international student from Africa. Grinnell is one of my top choices but I\u2019m pretty skeptical about the location. I love that it\u2019s a college town but I\u2019ve heard pretty bad things about the town. \n\nAlso, how are the facilities (more specifically sports and fitness) ? Is there school spirit ? Does it relate with other schools in Iowa etc ? How isolated is it really ? Are there fun things to do outside the college ?\n\n\nThanks so much for your help !",

            "comment": "Based on my experiences in the class of 2016.\n\nThe town is very, very small, but has amenities supported by the student body that wouldn't normally be present in a town that size. There are a number of pretty nice restaurants, a movie theater, and a grocery store within a few blocks of the campus. However, most students do spend the majority of their time on campus, as the college works hard to provide everything students need there, including plenty of events. The lack of activity in town didn't bother me because there was so much to do on campus anyway. \n\nI wasn't involved in the sports programs, so I can't speak to those facilities directly, but they seemed pretty nice. I would say there is a strong sense of community, if that's what you mean by school spirit, but people don't really turn out for sports events. \n\nI never had any interaction with other schools in Iowa, though I think certain programs may cooperate with them for some events. It's about an hour by car either direction from Iowa City and Des Moines, and slightly further to Cedar Rapids, the only major-ish cities nearby. Very few students regularly travel to any of them, in my experience.\n\nI was also worried about the area, since I'm from a large city, but it turned out to be pretty much a non-issue. It will definitely be a different experience from going to school in a big city, but I was busy enough on campus that I didn't miss it 99% of the time.",

I'd also add that based on what I've heard from friends at a wide variety of schools across the country, Grinnell's response to the coronavirus pandemic has been among the best and most streamlined of any college in the country.",

            "comment": "My son is also seriously considering Grinnell and since he can\u2019t visit has been talking to a lot of people about it.  From what he\u2019s learned, the student body is close knit, the town has some great eateries and the school brings in a lot of things for students to do on the weekend.   \n\nI went to a school that was also considered  isolated and in the middle of nowhere, Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH and never once considered it an issue.  My take on college is that if you are engaged in your  classes, extracurricular activities and friends, you will be so busy that you won\u2019t think about the town.",

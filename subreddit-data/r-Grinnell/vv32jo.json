    "postText": "Hey everyone! I'm here because I am thinking about applying to Grinnell for this upcoming admission cycle. I currently have 20 colleges on my list and am trying to narrow it down to around 10-12. I have limited knowledge of Grinnell and would like to hear from current students about their time there. If possible, could some people give me an honest pro and con list on the different aspects of the college? You can discuss anything \u2014 weather, academics, social life, athletics, or dining. I am planning on registering for information sessions but would like the information not given at info sessions. Thank you so much for your help!",

Pros: really good financial aid, people are smart and chill, really good profs and also available to office hours. Cons: unless you\u2019re planning to go to tech or academia, our career advisory team is horrible. Isolated school, parties can get repetitive.",

However, people are pretty respectful in general. Again, depends on the dorms you go. South dorms are known for parties, which is where most people smoke. Any of the other dorms you won\u2019t find much of it",

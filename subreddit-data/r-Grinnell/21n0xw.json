    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI have been accepted into Grinnell as a Trustee Scholar (15-20k scholarship), and waitlisted for the following: Haverford, Carleton, and Macalester.\n\nI\u2019m sure other students who have applied to LAC\u2019s have faced a similar decision, so I am curious as to what factors led to your final decision at one of these colleges.\n\nI really take quality of education as the biggest priority, but of course, I also need to consider financial aid and the like. Should I pursue the wait lists for Haverford, Carleton, and Macalester? What are some key differences between the four? And what should I be looking at when deciding whether I want to accept the waitlists?\n\nThanks.",

Just take the money at Grinnell, I would say. It sounds like you got a great scholarship, and Grinnell is a really wonderful school to attend.\n\nMacalester is a great school, though. If I had to pick a college other than Grinnell, Mac would be pretty close to the top of the list.",

On one side, there isn't any downside to not accepting the waitlist. But the other part of me asks whether I would attend Carleton, Haverford, or Macalester even if I got off the waitlist, especially with the scholarship from Grinnell. \n\nAlso, looks like there's a lot of love for Mac from Grinnell students :)",

I get the sense that Carleton and Haverford have slightly higher achieving students than Grinnell and Macalester has slightly lower (whenever I talk about something academic with them it seems like they don't know what they're talking about), but that's not to say that the quality of the education at these schools isn't probably equivalent. \n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between these schools is the culture. At Grinnell, I found most people to be very unpretentious, welcoming and intellectual. I *don't* get this sense when I talk to the people I know from Macalester - at Grinnell, everyone knows each other but when you ask Mac kids whether they've met another friend of yours that goes there, they invariably have no idea who you're talking about. \n\nPeople at Grinnell are also extraordinarily easy going, but so much so that it almost seems unprofessional. Talking to kids from Haverford and Carleton it seems like they are just a little more buttoned-up. This is a quality that I appreciate sometimes but is also pretty annoying and boring other times.\n\nI dont know, dude. Good luck. If you go to Grinnell, you surely wont be missing out on anything huge and crucial. It's a great school in a great town.\n\nOne thing that I will say, though, is that Grinnell's career development office is pretty bad, and a school like Carleton, Haverford or Mac might be a little bit better because its name is a little more widely know.",

The school has a more laid-back vibe than the other and has significantly more resources (i.e., endowment) than the other two that I have experience with. This might not seem important for the student side of things, but the size of the endowment does have a trickle-down effect on students. In addition, I'm a huge advocate of the open curriculum at Grinnell, and I think it's generally more progressive, diverse, and civicly-minded than where I work now. I loved being at Grinnell; if I was a student now at the institution where I currently work, I don't think I'd be as happy.",

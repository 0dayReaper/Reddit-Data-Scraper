    "postText": "I\u2019m curious to see how many littles (for some, ABDLs) there are on this campus. This is a fairly large school and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m the only one.\n\nFor those who are curious, \u201clittles\u201d are people that are comfortable adopting a childish mentality to life, whether temporarily in a \u201cscene\u201d, or on an everyday basis. A common acronym for people that subscribe to this mentality is DDLG (Daddy dom/little girl), where an adult female is taken care of by another adult male. But it has so many more applications beyond that, both in terms of the genders involved and the roles they take.\n\nJust like anything else, being little is not black-and-white, it\u2019s a gradient. Some people who are aware of/involved in the community choose not to participate, and only express their support. It would be kind of like a gay person having a \u201cstraight ally\u201d (although this is completely separate from sexual orientation).\n\nThen you have people who participate, but aren\u2019t \u201clittle.\u201d You could call them \u201cbigs\u201d. These are people who are natural caretakers - ones who\u2019ll protect other littles to no end, take care of whatever their littles need, and will ensure their littles feel safe. Oftentimes, males and females on this end will be called \u201cdaddies\u201d and \u201cmommies,\u201d but they can also have a more older brother/sister tendency.\n\nOn the \u201clittle\u201d end you have people who can get really deeply regressed. By \u201cregression,\u201d the meaning can differ from person to person, but overall they act younger, smaller, and simple. For a majority of littles, this means they love wearing cute pajamas, their favorite shows are cartoons, and they get fussy when they\u2019re tired. Some are picky eaters or \u201crequire\u201d the protection of their favorite stuffed animal and pacifier at night. Others love getting bubble baths, wearing diapers (and having them changed), and being held in someone\u2019s arms.\n\nSo why am I asking about this? Because I\u2019m curious to see who else is out there. To some, it may all seem ridiculous, but you\u2019d be surprised how many people will say \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was a word for it - me too!\u201d whenever I explain what being a big or a little is. MANY people would fall into the \u201clittle\u201d category to at least some degree, based on the descriptions I gave. Maybe, with this post, I\u2019ll find more littles. I know that most people would never guess I\u2019m a little.\n\nSo how about it? Who identifies as a little?",

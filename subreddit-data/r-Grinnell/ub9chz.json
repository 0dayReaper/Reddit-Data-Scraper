    "postText": "Hey guys. I\u2019m currently trying to decide between Mizzou or Grinnell for college. Posting this on both subreddits to hopefully get some good insight on both sides. Let me know if you need more details. Help \ud83e\udd72\n\nEdit: my major is undecided. I want to try a lot of different things and see what I enjoy (and what would allow for a high-paying job). Some of my interests are studio art, mathematics, Spanish, Japanese, engineering, and women\u2019s and gender studies. I\u2019m out-of-state if that helps, but not international.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m going to Mizzou! Thank you guys so much for all the comments, they really helped me get an idea of the college I couldn\u2019t get otherwise. I\u2019m sure Grinnell is a great place, I just don\u2019t think it would be a good fit for me.",

I\u2019ve heard that it would be easier to explore different academic subjects at a large university, would you say this is wrong when it comes to Mizzou vs. Grinnell? I definitely want to go somewhere where I don\u2019t have to commit to a major and can explore a bunch of different areas. I think Mizzou has more actual areas of study.",

When I was at Grinnell, the CS faculty were refocusing their course work to be multidisciplinary; it intersected with studio art quite a bit, and it won me over. Idk if other departments do that, or if other departments at other colleges do that, but it felt pretty special at the time. I look back on my college years very fondly and still talk with college friends on a daily basis.",

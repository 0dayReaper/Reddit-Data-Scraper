            "comment": "It's there, but totally avoidable, IMO. I would say that most students drink, to some extent, but plenty don't.\n\nThere's a small but vocal crowd who get really angry about all the drinking, and plan alternate substance-free events for all the big parties, so you can hang with them if that's your scene. Aside from that, though, there are also just plenty of people who choose not to drink and don't make a fuss about it--and as a result they aren't a super visible presence, in comparison with the partiers and the militant sub-free crowd, but they're definitely there.\n\nMostly, I don't think it's really worse than any other school. Lots of people drink, most do it fairly responsibly, some do it to excess, and some don't drink at all. You'll have no problem finding a sub-free crowd to hang with if that's what you're looking for!\n\nEdit: I should say, I was class of '16, and I hear the administration is cracking down on drinking, but I've been gone for a year so I can't really say how the culture may be changing as a result.",

            "comment": "It's undeniably there. People take to it in all sorts of ways. You have people who get blackout drunk everyweekend as well as folk who are only casual. For students, there isnt an immediate night life or local entertainment to leech from but we do a good job at creating alrernatives. \n\nStill the pressure is palpable sometimes. But i think that Grinnell's openness with it creates a confirmation bias of sorts. In the end, youll find a big drinking culture at most small schools I think. ",

            "comment": "I would definitely agree with those who say that nobody will judge you for not drinking. It's also true that substance free people who don't find a group of sub free friends to hang out with on weekend nights often get lonely, even though there are scheduled sub free events. I'm a sub free person with a tight group of sub free friends and I'm having a great experience, but I know that not everybody does.",

I don't go to a lot of them, but the ones I have been to were mostly movies in an amphitheatre, plus one incredibly rambunctious bingo evening. That actually made me want to go to more of them, but to be honest I had to check my email to try and remember what the other events have been. I don't have good wifi right now, so I never managed to figure out that out. On most weekends I'll play board games with my sub free friends, or when it's warm we try to go stargazing on the soccer fields. ",

I'm not sure if Grinnell allows non-traditional undergraduate students, but many universities such as Brown or Yale have programs like RUE or the Eli Whitney program, which allow people like you to apply!  I recommend reaching out to Grinnell's Office of Admissions as I am sure they are familiar with non traditional student applications.\n\nGood luck, and I hope it works out for you!\n\nHave a nice day!",

I *think* he had earned a year or two of credit elsewhere, worked for about fifteen years, and then came to Grinnell. He was a very good-natured fellow and seemed to get along well with the other students (who were at least 15 years younger than he was).\n\nI think his case was quite unusual back then - but it shows that it was *possible* at that time.",

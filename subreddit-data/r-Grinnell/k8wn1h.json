    "postText": "Hi again! So part of my financial aid package is work study (about 2500 a year) and I was wondering if any students who have had a work study job can tell me how they decided to manage their money. how much did you keep for personal expenses and how much did you apply towards what the school expects you to contribute? any strategies? in your experience with the work study jobs you\u2019ve had, were you actually working your whole shift? how many hours did you work a week? \ni will still be applying to more scholarships in an effort to get these costs covered early on (they\u2019re kinda making me nervous not sure why) but in the case that work study is my best bet i\u2019d like to hear from other students and their experience with it. \n( i think im nervous about it because my counselor told me it\u2019s helpful for personal expenses but terrible in terms of paying for tuition) \nthank you in advance!",

In your second or third year, you\u2019ll likely be able to find a work study job where you can spend more time studying. I loved working for the box office. Honestly I spent all the money on my expenses at the time rather than saving.",

I am an international student and I will apply for a huge amount of aid, probably an EFC of 2k. would it be hard for me to get in or should I apply to another college? also what about fine arts major there?",

            "comment": "Grinnell doesn\u2019t admit by major so you don\u2019t need to worry about which major you are applying as. That being said, Grinnell is need-aware for internationals so it will be very difficult to get accepted but to be fair, Grinnell is hard to get in for domestic students so it\u2019s worth a shot. Especially since there\u2019s no application fee or essay.",

Grinnell is stronger in physics, Kenyon is a bit stronger with visual art. Do you have any particular preferences with student culture, academics, etc.?",

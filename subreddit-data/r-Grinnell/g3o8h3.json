            "comment": "Most floors are coed where men can be in one dorm room while women can be in the dorm next door. However, there are some floors where the entire floor is one sex. I don't know if this is defacto or de jure, but it's there. Among the coed floors, there are multiple bathrooms on them that are gender inclusive, males only, or females only. So like the bathroom in the middle of the floor can be gender inclusive, and one bathroom on the right side of the hallway can be just for females (and there is a sign posted on the door to mark it) and then one bathroom say all the way to the left of the floor for all males. The doors to enter these public communal bathrooms tend to be closed if they are gender specific, but sometimes people just prop them up and the floor may or may not care. You can shower whatever you feel comfortable, and you can close the shower door that separates showers from the toilets and sinks so no one can get close to the showers.",

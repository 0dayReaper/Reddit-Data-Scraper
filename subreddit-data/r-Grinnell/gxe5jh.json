    "postText": " \n\nHey y'all! Don't know if this kinda stuff is allowed here, but anyways, I made a redbubble shop. It is kinda sparse rn, but there will be more, I promise. Theres a lot of Grinnell stuff that will be there! It is all hand drawn, and I will be donating all of the profits to Equal Justice Initiative, a black-owned nonprofit that seeks to mitigate racial injustice especially in the legal system and reduce the rate of mass incarceration in the US. If you have heard of the book or film, Just Mercy, they are affiliated with that.\n\nI've linked a couple of the designs I've made so far. You can get all sorts of stuff, including t-shirts, stickers, tote bags, etc. \n\nHere is the link to my redbubble shop: [https://www.redbubble.com/people/eseehorn/shop?asc=u&amp;ref=account-nav-dropdown](https://www.redbubble.com/people/eseehorn/shop?asc=u&amp;ref=account-nav-dropdown&amp;fbclid=IwAR29WLa7GRhciVcF7BvAcRZBDDSaECuwFSKelm9O8Wxmv08WxX8N7LlSgAE)\n\nHere is a link to the Equal Justice Initiative page, so if you are interested, you can learn more about their work: [https://eji.org/](https://eji.org/?fbclid=IwAR3lknR21xHDHQu9FmzFe1c_xfVs4ck2K_G8ssGB6svfxX114n9adSdk-MQ)\n\nI hope this doesn't come off as shameless self promo; I just thought this would be a good community to share it in, and it is for a good cause. Also, if there are any designs, Grinnell related or otherwise, that you would like to see, lmk, and I will see what I can do!\n\n(you can also click on any product or design to see all the ways you can get it, the display thing is randomly generated)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The designs that are currently up. I take requests too!](https://preview.redd.it/ltmk76ltz5351.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9d5a92fbeb54b771add2b50a3725a0dc5f377640)",

The concerns expressed were never my intent when I created the design, but I completely was able to see where the concerns were coming from. Out of respect for everyone involved, I took that particular design down.",

    "postText": "Hey y'all,\n\nI'm an incoming '25, and as for now, I plan on taking foreign language courses in college. I have about 5 years of Spanish already under my belt from High School and Junior High, but this is because Spanish was the only foreign language my school offered to its students. While I enjoy the Spanish language and have worked up a decent level of proficiency, I feel like it's time for me to try something new. Grinnell has a plethora of different languages to study within its second language/culture programs, and I want current students' opinions on which language department is the best one to study under at Grinnell.\n\nWith all of that being said, the question is: \"Should I continue to study Spanish in college, or should I branch out to another language? If so, which language is the best to study at Grinnell?\"\n\nThank guys!",

Regardless of whether or not you choose to continue Spanish at Grinnell, I strongly encourage you to take the language placement test when it\u2019s offered (when I was a first year it was in-person during NSO but I\u2019m guessing the format will be different depending on the status of the pandemic). This is just in case you decide you want to take Spanish at some point during your time at Grinnell and you won\u2019t have to start from square one. \n\nI\u2019m personally biased in favor of the German department! The professors are awesome and there are so many opportunities for German majors/learners both on-campus and abroad. But regardless of my opinion, you should choose a language with which you feel a real connection, because language classes at Grinnell are a lot of work (but worth the effort!)",

Grinnell even offers a super nice Alternative Language Study Program, which you can try in your second year, if there is a language you wanna study that isn't offered.  However, I do agree completely with Sourdough Heart that you should take the language placement test when offered.  You don't have to worry about it too much because they will send you an email when they want you to do it, and the reason you should take it is because if you do change your mind and wanna do Spanish, you don't need to start from the 100-level courses.\n\nHope it works out for you.\n\nHave a nice day!",

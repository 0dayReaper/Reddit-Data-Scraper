And what do you think made them finally accept you ? Did you write an loci ? And how was it ? \nAlso, how common it is for grinnell to choose students from the waitlist ? And would my efc affect it ? \nThank you !",

I would continue engaging your admissions counselor and write a letter expressing your continued interest if Grinnell is your top choice! Most people on the waitlist will move on/give up so you\u2019ll definitely stand out.",

With a loci, an additional letter, and consistent contact with my advisor, I was accepted. If you make it clear Grinnell is your top choice, I think you have a shot. \n\nGood Luck!",

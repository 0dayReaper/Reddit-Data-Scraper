Long shot: young male asian prof who was there at least 2013-2015... anyone remember the name? Wonder how he's doing now.\n\nEdit: remembered the name! Looks like he's at U Cincinnati now.

You're doing labs most days, but they're always with a partner (two people, one keyboard). It's not just about coding and coding theory, but about problem solving overall and actually kind of an art project (the class used GIMP, which is basically free and open source Photoshop).\n\nThe class really makes you challenge how you actually think analytically and what assumptions you make (which is useful when writing, since it makes you better back your arguments up instead of taking things for granted). It makes you break down complex problems into digestible bites.\n\nI liked CS when I was in high school from online forums and gaming, but hated the idea of CS because I'm a woman and online gaming communities are a shitshow. I was planning on majoring in political science and GWSS, but fell in love with CS and the CS community at Grinnell. All classes have mentors, there are student workers paid to help out most nights (from 6-10?) for all of the intro sequence. The department also is willing to adjust to help and support you, even if you're a pain in the ass (I was.). I also found that there was a lot of alum support when I was a student, and as an alum try and give that back too.\n\nRegardless of major, I think intro CS is a good weird class to take and would be useful elsewhere (especially with the social sciences which are getting a lot more analytics based). Having it on a resume is just useful too because it shows you can think analytically and programmatically.\n\nWhile your question is more based on taking intro at all, I can corporate shill for the department as a major too. Even though Grinnell is a tiny liberal arts school, graduates aren't limited by that - it's got an extremely high employment rate and is highly respected in research/grad school as well.",

            "comment": "CS151 was easily my most influential course I took at Grinnell, but someone already said that, so I'll give some others.\n\nIf you continue in CS, take AI or Computer Vision with Weinman. His standards are extremely high and it is unlikely you will get an A, but you will learn a lot. I'd also suggest anything with Paulhus, but particularly Combinatorics. \n\nFor the social sciences... \n\nNationalism, with Sala. (Political Science) She's from Catalan so it's something she can speak a lot about. She's also just an amazing human being and extremely funny. She'll call you on your bullshit for not doing the reading. Anything she teaches is worthwhile. \n\nDeviance and Social Control with Ross Haenfler. He's an amazing professor, extremely understanding, and the class is really fun and interesting. He oversaw my senior research and was an excellent advisor. \n\nI'd also suggest anything weird or a special topic with Skadi Snook. She's apparently an acquired taste (she's brutally honest, stubborn, and doesn't put up with shit), but she is extremely smart and will support you in learning. If she teaches a class on heathenism/witches/paganism, it's worth taking because she is a heathen and gets really into it; my year we got to go to weekend trip for a heathen celebration. It was awesome.\n\nIf you're really curious on a prof and their interests, I'd look up their CV and see their research. It's nerdy as hell for sure, but can you tell if they're teaching a class because they have to for the department or because they're interested in it. Dont trust ratemyprof, it's pretty heavily biased.\n\nI graduated three years ago, but feel free to dm me if you have any questions. What's your tutorial?",

It's one of the most fundamental concepts that everyone needs to understand to be a functioning member of society. Jonkman and Kuiper were two of my favorite stats profs, and I think both are still there. Kuiper has a lot of real-world experience with applying stats, so is great at teaching why it's relevant to everything. Jonkman is a bit more theoretical, but he's a great guy.",

He cares a lot about every student\u2019s development, is organized with handouts prepped for every class, replies super fast whenever you need help (even late night, he used to respond in an instant), and makes Latin somehow bearable. \n\nIntro to Studio Art is also a great class. The prof who teaches it may vary from semester to semester. But it is the one that led me to switch my career trajectory and I loved it. If you get further into the Art classes Sculpture is also a great one. \n\nI came to Grinnell expecting to do the CS major but I have changed my mind. But I agree with the previous commenters that CSC 151 is a great one (I recommend taking it with Charlie Curtsinger, imo he is one of the best in the department now) but is a hit or miss depending on the prof. One thing I would like to address is that the focus of the course has shifted from tinkering with image manipulation to data science several years ago, so the CSC 151 that some of the alums have mentioned may essentially be a different one from the CSC 151 that is offered today. I also agree that Jerod Weinman teaches very well and has a very high standard so you will learn a lot and be challenged but be braced for a very rigorous semester. \n\nI would add one thing about the CS program that in many of the classes you work with another classmate, taking turns on the same computer. The intention behind it is that two people can collaborate and enhance their communication as coders and problem solvers. But in my personal opinion, after taking several classes in the department, I would say that this structure was not conducive and beneficial to the way I prefer to learn and rather deterred me from being genuinely engaged and absorbed in the material, as I work and learn better when I am consistently required to take full responsibility of the task at hand.",

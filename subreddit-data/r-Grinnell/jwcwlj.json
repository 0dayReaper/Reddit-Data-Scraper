International admissions are need-aware, meaning that they will only accept you if they can afford to. If you're asking for more than like $20k-$30k a year, your chances of getting in are greatly reduced. \n\nYou should speak to the OISA about this, they'd be able to help you much more than Reddit can.",

We alums just got an email yesterday saying that all loans are being converted to scholarships for at least the duration of the pandemic :).\n\nIf you're international, though, things can be extremely different. Definitely get in touch with the financial aid office and OISA (office of international student affairs)!",

Grinnell meets full demonstrated need for all their applicants, including international students, so it's likely that your full need will be covered.  Grinnell also offers merit aid, which can be really helpful in reducing the cost of attendance too.\n\nGood luck, I truly hope you get into Grinnell!\n\nHave a nice day!",

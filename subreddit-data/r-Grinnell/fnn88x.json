    "postText": "\nHi,\nI\u2019m Parent of Admitted student (class of 2024) can\u2019t visit campus.  Would love feedback from others who have as to their impressions (especially if you\u2019re from a major metropolitan area).  Also, how is the music scene on campus. My son has been writing, recording and performing out with his indie punk band for 2 years and I know he\u2019d be really happy at Grinell if there were other kids who might want to be in a band.",

The campus is small and homey. The architecture is gorgeous. The dorms are on the older side, with the exception of East Campus, but that personally is my style. Everyone is really helpful and friendly. They really value community and being able to help each other out. It felt like they were a big family. All of the classrooms and buildings I were able to see were really nice. The dining hall is excellent, and there are lots of awesome events that come to campus.",

            "comment": "There's a lot of music opportunities I feel like. While I'm not sure about music and the fine arts department specifically because I'm not in that field of study, there is a lot of events to do music. We have tiny dorm concerts where students can perform originals or covers to their friends and classmates in a small dorm or off campus house. We have open mic events for something similar with the inclusion of slam poetry, stand up comedy, instrumental only performances. We have grinnell concerts, where the committee gets a lot of upcoming bands and artists to come to our campus and perform for free for us. It is open to the public, but in my experience not many towns people come except like the same 3 people. Big names like 100 gecs and surf curse came this year. A lot of indie and upcoming artists have came and said they liked us as a venue/host. In previous years, Frankie cosmos and chance the rapper came I've heard.",

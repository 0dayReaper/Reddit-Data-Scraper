    "postText": "Hello everyone! I just had a few questions about grading/grade deflation at Grinnell. I am planning on pursuing the premed track and majoring in either anthropology or English. If I did well in AP Chem and AP Physics C, would I be well prepared for the intro science courses at Grinnell? Is a 3.7+ doable as a humanities/social sciences major, or is this close to impossible to achieve? Would you say proffessors are pretty good at grading objectively or do they often let their own personal biases get in the way? Are most people able to get into a med school the first time they apply? And finally, what are the habits/traits that distinguish those who are able to get into med school from those who are not at Grinnell? \n\nThank you in advance!",

I don\u2019t know how helpful I\u2019ll be to you since I majored in biochemistry, but I got into med school on my first try. Despite majoring in biochem, I took a bunch of humanities classes including anthropology and Spanish. I did take a gap year after Grinnell, just because I wanted to take a little time off school for a bit. I graduated with a high GPA, got good letters, and great extracurricular experiences. Most people I know from Grinnell who have wanted to go on to med or grad school have been able. My personal opinion is that most professors and fair graders if you put in the time and effort. They\u2019re more than willing to help you if you\u2019re struggling if you reach out to them and go to office hours. Grinnell was a fantastic experience for me and I have zero regrets.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have more questions.",

            "comment": "I think you will absolutely be prepared for intro science courses at Grinnell with those AP credentials, but (whether classes are in-person or online in the fall) if you are very motivated to keep your GPA up, consistently go to office hours to talk with the professor about the material and even get a peer tutor for more support.   When I took Intro Physics as a curious 4th Year my peer tutor was a super talented first year (lol)--who is now getting her PhD in physics, but with her smarts and HS experience she was well-prepared to hold my hand through Newton's laws etc.   I think professors are pretty objective in the sciences, but appreciate engaged, hard-working students, so I think their personal feelings toward you can only help you.  Definitely try to build good relationships, though, whether for a possible boost or for future rec letters.  I think a 3.7 is definitely doable, but you should make sure you focus on your studies.  Don't overload on extracurricular obligations right off the bat.  Focus on class and finding your people and start exploring additional obligations once you feel comfortable in your academics.  I have a lot of friends in med schools of different types (some are in DO programs) and I can only think of one who had to re-apply.  Good luck!",

            "comment": "I am a first-year student. Although I am not pre-med, I am a bio major and took the same intro sciences I would imagine that you would be taking first year. You will definitely be well-prepared for Grinnell courses if you did well in those APs. Honestly, if you work hard, study smart and strategically, and don't choose the few professors that will screw you over a 3.7 is very doable. I was able to balance getting all As, having a job, volunteering, and partying almost every weekend night my first semester. I think that it is easier to get a high GPA as a humanities major. Professors are generally very happy to help you, and each one has a different grading style. For example I corrected a handful of APA citation issues, grammatical issues, and so forth and I raised my grade 7% on a paper earlier this semester. I would say that Grinnell professors do not grade with bias, and are very fair. I really really have enjoyed my time insofar at Grinnell! Welcome! The one thing that I would say is avoid online classes, they have been a fiasco insofar and they are pretty much the opposite of the way that most of the professors would like to teach. Take a gap year if you need to and if you can to avoid online classes. If you have any questions I would love to hear from you",

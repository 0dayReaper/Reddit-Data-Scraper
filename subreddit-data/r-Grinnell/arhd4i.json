Easy to walk around to buy groceries, the movies, restaurants, and Saints Rest.  However you\u2019re likely to live near/next to students, but the high majority are perfectly fine neighbors.  Otherwise the location in Grinnell doesn\u2019t seem to matter too much, just the quality of the home/apartment. \n\nAlso, as much as I love Grinnell, just make sure you know it\u2019s an extremely small town with limited entertainment/shopping/restaurant options.  There are plenty of people that live in Newton, Altoona, or even Iowa city and commute into Grinnell everyday, just an option.",

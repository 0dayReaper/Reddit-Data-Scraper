That has changed since covid and there are less off campus parties so i personally party with my friends in the dorms more often. Totally depends on ur friend group. School organized events are fun if you pregame them. Fun can be had but i would not call us a party hard work hard school like it used to be",

Family member attends and they would say from their experience it\u2019s definitely work hard / play hard \u2014 it has helped that COVID protocols have loosened up a bit.",

The town doesn\u2019t have any nightlife besides a pub that ids that students don\u2019t really go to. The social scene is blacking out and then studying.  It feels a lot like high school just because it\u2019s so cliquey. The academics are very challenging and I\u2019ve had some great professors, but the social scene kinda sucks. i\u2019m transferring.",

This may sound ridiculous but I've never been to Iowa and I'm a bit unsure about attending college in a Red state as someone who is part of a visible minority group and also Queer identifying.",

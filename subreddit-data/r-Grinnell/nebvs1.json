    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nI was recently admitted to the CO2025 as an international . I feel incredibly lucky and thankful because only 5% of internationals were admitted this year.\n\nI have a question about on campus jobs. My need was generously met, but the amount I have to pay might not be completely comfortable for my family. Hence, I am hoping to at least pay some of my fees by working on campus. \n\nThe on campus cap is 20 hours a week for internationals. Is it a realistic estimate to say that I can work 14 hours a week, or more than that? If so, how much could I realistically earn a year?\n\nAlso, is it difficult to find on-campus jobs? Since freshmen are automatically recruited to the kitchen the first year, I want to know how it works. For the first year, is the kitchen job for only an hour a day? Or can I work more than that in the kitchen? Also, are any other jobs available for first years other than in the kitchen? Is it progressively easier for sophomores, juniors and seniors to find jobs?\n\nI was really worried to ask this to the college authorities because I felt this is a rude question to ask. Since I figured this is a sub frequented by students, I am asking here. Any inputs will be appreciated because, it would be really helpful for my family to calculate. If I underestimate my expenses, then it will be difficult to pay in the further years. If I toil and earn at least $5000 a year, it would be really really helpful for me.\n\nThanks for any insight!",

There probably are a handful of better paying jobs on Handshake (the app Grinnell uses for hiring students) but they may be hard for freshman to get into. \n\nWhen I worked at D Hall, it was a sign up thing, so I would sign up for my own shifts (usually around 3-4 hour shifts) for the first week and then that automatically became my weekly schedule. I was able to pretty comfortably work over 10 hours a week so I think 14 would be easy to work into your schedule. In that case you\u2019re basically looking at around $2100 earned per semester. Hope this helps!",

            "comment": "I strongly recommend working for Information Technology Services (ITS) if you are remotely interested in IT. While it doesn\u2019t pay as much as the DHall, it has the distinct advantage of not being the DHall!\n\nRegarding the \u2018automatic recruitment\u2019 to the DHall, it is not mandatory. You\u2019re free to work somewhere else instead, or nowhere at all. DHall jobs are just super easy to get.\n\nAs a former ITS Student Leader, I was easily clocking the maximum of 20 hours per week\u2014with the flexibility to work fewer hours if schoolwork got super busy.\n\nAs a normal student worker in ITS, you would be working scheduled shifts so may struggle to get all your 20 hours in. That said, having multiple campus jobs wasn\u2019t uncommon when I was at Grinnell.\n\nITS also had several positions available to student workers over the summer and fall/spring break (40 hour weeks). If you get the chance, I can\u2019t recommend spending a summer in Grinnell enough.\n\nAs an international student, the 20 hour/week legal restriction does not apply outside of school time. It\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s school policy for no students, domestic or international, to work more than 20 hours/week in school time.",

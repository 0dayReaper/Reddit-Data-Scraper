    "postText": "Hey, I recently got accepted into Grinnell but am hesitant on accepting due to it being in the middle of Iowa. I was just wondering if the CompSci program is actually worth the hype it gets online. And if the opportunities that come from Grinnell if it's worth going to. Also, does anyone have more information on how the 3-2 program works for engineering? I'm not finding much online and would love to hear more about that program.\n\nI would love to hear anyone's experience in the Compsci program or in the 3-2 program. What you loved about it or disliked. Just your perspective would be GREAT help right now.",

            "comment": "Hey OP. Just wanted to respond to this. Many tech companies go recruiting Grinnell grads because of how awesome they are. They come out to Iowa to check out what's happening lol. The 3-2 program would have you do 3 years at Grinnell and then finish your bachelor's and master's degree at another partner school. I will say that going here is absolutely worth it, and that considering all of the effort the college puts in to compensate for its isolated location, that it is really not as much of a worry as you think it is. \n\nHave a Nice Day!",

I have lots of questions (especially regarding the CS program), the location, research and internship opportunities, etc. Any help would be sincerely appreciated \ud83d\ude0a.",

From my experience, CS seems to be a close-knit department with plenty of opportunities after graduation. Don't know much about the 3-2 program, unfortunately.",

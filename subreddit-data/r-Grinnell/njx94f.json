Does the smaller window provide enough light? I haven't been able to find pictures of them, so any info would help. Thank you!!",

Grinnell is so lucky to have you.\n\nI lived in a pit level room for two months during 3rd quarter this year and overall, it was not bad at all.  Unfortunately, since you are underground, the view from the window isn\u2019t the best, but a lot of light does come in, so it definitely will not be too dark.  I actually personally found that too much light came in so I kept the blinds closed most of the time.  \n\nI also took some pictures of my room while I was there and would be happy to share that with you if you would like to check them out.  Hope you have a great first year, wishing you the best this fall!\n\nHave a nice day!",

I'm personally involved in music lessons, the student run radio station,  and weekly computer science tables.  There are also a lot of student sporting activities with a really wide range of commitment.  Ultimate frisbee is an example. I have friends involved in theater productions,  ensembles,  sports, mock trial, debate,  and a student music association called Free Sound. Those are some (a small portion) of examples of what's available. I'm personally a huge fan of the radio station. It's an incredible opportunity for students to broadcast their thoughts to the surrounding community, not to mention share some good music.",

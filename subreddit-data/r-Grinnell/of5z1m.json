I\u2019m an incoming \u201825 student and after seeing so many transfers from the classes of \u201824 and \u201823, i\u2019m left wondering why so many are transferring out. Is there something going on that\u2019s making the school worse? Like what\u2019s going on, and should I be concerned?",

There are some choices they made during COVID that I was extremely frustrated with. Overall, I wouldn\u2019t be super concerned. Small issues seemed to accentuated by not having students on campus. Admin didn\u2019t adapt to online super well (but the professors did on average). After having a year studying at Grinnell, I\u2019m still confident that it was the right choice for me, despite the admin BS.",

A lot of what I heard was people transferred because of frustration with the administration at Grinnell. Small issues were being blown out of proportion by certain members of administration and some people were fed up",

Sure, I was annoyed too by some of the decisions by administrators at Grinnell, but it\u2019s nothing more than a minor inconvenience for the most part. It\u2019s also kind of a \u201cbond over negativity\u201d around campus that everybody doesn\u2019t like the administration, as bad as it sounds lol. Knowing what I do now, I still would choose Grinnell",

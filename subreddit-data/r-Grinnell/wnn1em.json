I am an international student and am strongly considering applying to Grinnell but I am a little concerned about making friends since its such a small college and I am not the most extroverted person. So would it be possible to lmk how easy is it to integrate. Also could I have some more information about the quality of the Career Advisory Services here. Thksss",

Being a small school actually helps because everyone will recognize you and invite you to stuff. It's much harder to fall through the cracks than at a large school. \n\nOne word of caution though...be careful about getting too friendly with people on campus. STD's, like syphilis, have been running rampant this past year. I have caught it at least 8 times!!!",

It\u2019s divided into \u2018career communities\u2019 so you are matched with an advisor who is well versed in what you want to do post-grad. your first year you\u2019ll be matched with an exploratory advisor who will\u2026well help you explore. I can only speak to my own career community (STEM) but it is fantastic. There\u2019s also a separate advisor for competitive fellowships.",

    "postText": "Hi everybody!  I have mostly been lurking this subreddit, but it is nice to meet all of you, and I hope all of you are doing well and staying safe.  I'm a committed Class of 2024 member, and I am so excited to be a Grinnellian!\n\nI have a feeling r/Grinnell probably has had a lot of questions asked on dorms, so I apologize that i am asking another dorm related question, but I couldn't find much info out there on South vs. East side dorms, so I was wondering if I could receive feedback on either.\n\nI filled out my Housing and Roommate form a few weeks ago, and at the time, I liked East and South side dorms equally, so I put down that I preferred East and South equally over North.  However, recently, I've been reconsidering things and starting to wonder if I should write that I prefer the East side because I have been reading that East is known to be more quiet.  As an introvert, I still love to participate in social events or the community, but I definitely enjoy some quiet time to unwind.  In addition, since I don't intend on staying in the dorm too often, I thought it would be nice if I could have a quiet place to unwind in like East.  I also have been reading about East has really good facilities, and I loved the look of the outside and inside of the dorms.  At the same time, I read that South has a really vibrant community, which seemed really appealing!  I also read that South has a lot of artistic and humanistic events/work going on, which seemed super appealing as I've always wanted to engage in projects like these.  I also requested a substance free dorm so the main halls I'm considering are Kershaw from East vs. James from South Halls.  I am aware that substance free dorms aren't guaranteed, so it's more of a East vs. South debate, but I thought that was worth mentioning too.\n\nThank you for your time, and I really appreciate it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave a nice day!\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/gn0csz)",

I lived on East two years and North 2 years and enjoyed my time on North better because it way infinitely more social.",

I'm hoping to stay in substance free dorms, so I'm not sure how South's substance free dorms compare to South in itself, but I really appreciate your input!  This is good to know, but from the polls and answers I'm getting, it sounds like I might like East a lot.  \n\nI am happy you enjoyed your time at North!\n\nHave a nice day!",

            "comment": "Hey, I'm class of 2017 so graduated quite a while back but had the same dilemma exactly when choosing dorms. I ultimately ended up in James and honestly couldn't be happier that I did.\n\nWe had the subfree atmosphere of East campus, but there actually was.. An actual connection to campus culture, even if I wasn't directly participating in it (subfree lifestyle). We also just actually hung out in the lounges and could have fun in the middle of the day without pissing people off by using the lounges (the east campus ones echoed a lot).\n\nI'd also say that first year is a good one to spend in James because it's a lot easier, imo, to make friends in a more social environment. The older students in east, from my four years at Grinnell, frequently already had established friend groups and mostly hung out with them and not new students.\n\nEast also literally isn't built for \"hanging out\" the way you can with the other dorms. The doors close automatically and are heavy, so it's hard to have the kind of \"hallway atmosphere\" that the other dorms do have. Kershaw in particular is also known as the most dead dorm out of all of east campus, so if you did want east campus I'd suggest a different one for your first year.. However east is the best if you need accessible housing OR if you have very severe allergies or sensitivities to smells (like pot). \n\nNo matter what, either dorm is a good choice. Grinnell has the nice situation where you can live anywhere and still find social life elsewhere; with either of these dorms you can go out and have fun, and still come home and not have vomit in the sink. \n\n\nSorry for rambly answer, its the middle of the work day and I'm on mobile. Also I graduated three years ago, so chances are things may have changed.\n\nGood luck in the fall!!",

            "comment": "Heyo! As a fellow introvert who started in East (and intends to stay there), I think I can probably help you out a bit. \n\nI'll get this out of the way first: East is *great,* whether you're an introvert or not. Like you mentioned, they're by far the newest and best-appointed. Nice decor, a/c, typically more spacious rooms, thicker walls, etc. It's also definitely the quietest, and the best place to serve as a quiet retreat. \n\nThe downside is it's definitely not nearly as social, and it can be comparatively difficult to make friends there, especially if you're not particularly outgoing. I'd say it's caused by a combination of the self-fulfilling prophecy of its reputation as the introverts' dorm, and the fact that the lounge areas are very poorly laid out for just hanging out with friends. While the fact that you plan on not spending a ton of time in the dorm will help you make friends, you never know how things'll work out; plus, it's nice to have a good, close group of friends close by. \n\nBasically, you have a choice between the safe and easy path (East), and a higher-risk, higher-reward option (South). If I were to do my freshman year over, I would probably do a year in North or South, and then the other three in East. \n\nBtw, most of my friends will be in Kershaw next year, so if you end up there, we'll probably see each other around. Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions or just want to chat about Grinnell!",

When I first filled out the form I put that I'd prefer either East or North and I got put in James. I was upset and didn't think I'd like it but I ended up loving it!\n\nBefore we got sent home for the semester I actually went around to every dorm hall to see which one I liked best. North definitely has the best architecture and depending on the hall, might be filled with sportos. East was the quietest. I ran into almost no one while walking around the buildings (however, they have air conditioning unlike North and South). South is the most connected. People would greet each other while walking down the loggia. James ended up being one big group of friends. I knew everyone on my floor and almost everyone on all three other floors. Everyone would come hang out in the lounges together to do homework, chat, or even do movie nights sometimes. I don't think this was a specifically James thing though, I know other halls had a pretty good sense of community too. Most of the non-subfree halls in south are home to parties and drinking though, and people in Cleveland will smoke right on the fire escape so even James smells like weed until the windows are closed for the winters.\n\nNo matter where you end up, feel free to reach out with any other questions! I'd be happy to answer them. One word of advice - if huge crowds stress you out I would definitely recommend trying to skip Palapalooza during NSO if you can. I really wish I had, it was not fun meeting 20+ new people in such a short time.",

There\u2019s a wide spectrum of political interest- some people aren\u2019t super interested, some people occasionally table for their candidate, and some people are deeply involved in political campaigns. Grinnell is the second largest Dem caucus in the state, so most major candidates have an office in town- Bernie, Warren, Pete, Yang, and Biden all had one- and off the top of my head Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg, Biden, Steyer, Yang, Bullock, Castro, and Booker all swung through Grinnell to speak (I probably forgot one or two that I didn\u2019t personally see). The 2024 Dem caucuses will probably be quieter than 2020, assuming the IDP doesn\u2019t do away with the caucus system entirely after the PR disaster of 2020, but if it\u2019s still around it\u2019ll be the event of the year.",

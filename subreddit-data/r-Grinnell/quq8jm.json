One thing that I've heard from whoever I talked to is that the interviews are more of a conversation than an interview.\n\nIdk about an interview with a senior student but I'm sure it'll be chill. Just be yourself.\n\nAll the best :)",

My advice is to just be yourself, don\u2019t be afraid to ramble. I myself talked about my piano for 10 minutes, and the interviewer actually liked it. Grinnell students are kinda quirky, so I think it is best to not overprepare and be yourself. Hope this helps you a bit!",

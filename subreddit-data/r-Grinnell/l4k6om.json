    "postText": "I just got accepted to this school so I wanted to know about some random things that piqued my interest online. \n\nDoes the BDSM club actually fuck? Like, does this school actually sponsor student sex dungeons because that\u2019s the coolest fucking shit I\u2019ve ever heard \n\nHow easy is it to score weed in Iowa? And I mean good weed. I\u2019m from - let\u2019s say, a weed friendly state - and I\u2019m kinda worried that the Iowa corn weed is going to be subpar. I early decisioned so it\u2019s no going back now but I gotta know what I\u2019m in for.\n\nIs the food shit? Ok, so most college students upsell their dining centers, but Grinnell ppl seem to be pretty honest. What should I avoid eating and what shouldn\u2019t I sleep on? \n\nWho\u2019s your most batshit professor and whose class should I avoid at all costs. \n\nDo dorms allow candles? I fucking love candles",

            "comment": "1. no, the club doesn't actually \"fuck\". no college has an official club that does. bdsm clubs in general don't. they teach safe techniques for stuff like ropes, and do so fully clothed. a bdsm club is not a sexual environment.\n\n2. weed... idk, the weed i got was ok. but i was there before even CO legalized so can't really speak to it.\n\n3. food is decent. better than most dining halls. but still dining hall food. it's really not bad though.\n\n4. don't remember any that were avoid at all costs. \n\n5. no, candles are not allowed, officially. it's not enforced though, or wasn't during my time. almost no dorms anywhere allow candles.",

            "comment": "I can answer your weed questions. You will get pretty bad mids unless you can meet some people. There are plugs with better flower but it\u2019s gonna cost a lot. Concentrates are total snake oil so don\u2019t get those. The real stoners used to get their shit on the web but that community is all but disappearing because it\u2019s risky af and dumb. PM me with any other questions. To answer your questions about candles, I\u2019d smoke weed in my room all day as a first year, so you\u2019re prob fine lighting a candle if you can figure out how to cover your smoke alarm.\n\nEdit: I quit smoking but would advise any Grinnellian stoners to just use the fire escape as a common courtesy. Less risk and you don\u2019t bother people with the smell.\n\nFood is meh. Gets worse over time imo. Avoid orgo with Sieck at all costs unless you want a semester of crying and hyper-stress",

I think it does have a benefit because the pool is smaller. But idk about the actual stats. If you have good essays and all that that can really bump your chances. \n\n3. I know a lot of people who got into really good grad schools. Couple in medschool. I personally got into one of the top law schools right out of grinnell. So personal vote.\n\n4. Don\u2019t really know much about the progam to speak on that.",

            "comment": "Hey, OP!  I hope you are doing well!  If Grinnell is your first choice, I 100% recommend applying ED1.  The Early Decision pool is around 500 students while the RD pool can be over 6,000-7,000 applicants.  In addition, they accept a much higher percentage of students ED.\n\nI unfortunately don't have much information on STEM life because I'm not a STEM student, and I apologize about that.  However, the graduate school placement is really good.  I recommend looking at this: [https://www.grinnell.edu/after-grinnell/graduate-outcomes-all-majors](https://www.grinnell.edu/after-grinnell/graduate-outcomes-all-majors)\n\nOn 3-2, I believe it's guaranteed except for Columbia University as long as you meet the requirements they impose, and you major in Physics.\n\nGood luck!\n\nHave a nice day!",

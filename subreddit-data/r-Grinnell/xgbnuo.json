Like malls, coffee shops etc.? And do interesting events happens within the college?? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "hi, im a city person, here at grinnell now (lived right next to nyc!)\n\ni would say that in terms of the social life here, it depends!\n\ngenerally, what i can say is that there's definitely a sense of community here: everyone is willing to help one another out, and it feels like everyones approachable here.\n\nin terms of outside the college, ive never really thought of going into town. compared to somewhere like nyc, its honestly just not very notable. while the town isn't like some sort of small wild west-esque town, its definitely a suburb: there's just a movie theater and a cafe or two (however, the restaurants are pretty good!). the only times i went into town were new student orientation, with family, or to go to walmart.\n\nhowever, the college itself is probably the main reason why i havent thought of going into town. like i said, the campus itself has a sense of community! the clubs are a great way to socialize, and theres a bunch of them. theres also cool events that happen within the college, like the \"harris\" events that happen pretty frequently. grinnell also has some quirks to it (if youre a party person, then theres almost always a party happening every week).\n\nso honestly, its really not as bad as the location might make it seem (trust me, ive lived next to nyc my whole life, ive had the same exact thoughts that you had)\n\njust know that grinnell is not too different from any other college, and that anywhere you go, youll just need to put yourself out there the first few weeks. any change is scary and sometimes isolating, but youll eventually find your place! it was definitely hard for me at first, but ive definitely come to really enjoy grinnell :) the community more than makes up for any downside.\n\ngood luck during college apps though, and hope to see you next fall!",

Luckily the college runs a shuttle that you can use, I think it\u2019s $5 or $6 per trip. As for the town of Grinnell, there are a couple coffee shops and some restaurants plus a bar or two, but not many people seem to go to those. There are a fair amount of events on campus put on by various student organizations as well as occasional College events. You\u2019ll hear a lot about the Harris parties which happen perhaps on average every other Friday night but there\u2019s definitely plenty to do if you get on the email lists for the various clubs. Unfortunately the town itself, due to its size, just doesn\u2019t have a whole lot going on.",

One or two coffee shops now, and a handful - 5 to 10 - of cafes and restaurants in town. The beauty of being in a small town for college for me was that there were certain amenities, but most of my focus was spent studying. Grinnellians study hard and party hard - there are lots of interesting events year round. There are resources available through the college so you can have parties as long as you have people willing to host.",

If your main concern is amenities (like if you have a restricted diet/specialized medical needs/etc) that's harder and is worth thinking about.",

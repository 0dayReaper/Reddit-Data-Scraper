But the Grinnell branch has always been helpful. They waived fees when I did dumb shit as a student like forgot to pay my card or overdrafted. \n\nA lot of people will go for the credit union. Also a very good option. (Can't quite remember the name. Central Iowa Credit Union? Or was the U of I one?)",

Discover also does credit cards, but I don't have one.\n\nIt's all online (no physical locations), their customer service is top notch (you just call and get a human), and there are no fees or minimums or anything. On the app, you can find which ATMs work for free (there are several near the campus that work). And you're not tied down Grinnell-- it works from anywhere.",

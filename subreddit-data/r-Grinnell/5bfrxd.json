I know about the controversy *before* the party happened... did something else happen afterward?",

            "comment": "The administration is trying to deemphasize drinking on campus. In order to do this they have changed the alcohol policy and canceled 10/10 and other alcohol related events. The replacement event was a massive failure with minimal attendance.\n\nThe fine residence of high street organized an off campus 10/10 with kegs at various houses but it just wasn't the same. With now 1/4 of the campus never having experienced a real 10/10 it's hard to see the tradition continuing in a serious capacity within the next few years (which was the plan of the administration the whole time).",

RayK sent an [all campus email](https://www.grinnell.edu/news/alcohol-policy-changes) over the summer. The new rules are:\n\n* If you are hosting a party in a public space (such as a lounge) with alcohol you need to fill out an alcohol agreement by the preceding Wednesday. If the party has below 20 people you need to list every attendees name to prove its less than 20. If the party has over 20 people then a registered server has to be present.\n\n* You are not allowed to drink alcohol in any public space without an alcohol agreement. However, they only give alcohol agreements for Friday and Saturday nights.\n\nThese rules are being enforced by Campus Safety and Community Advisors (formerly known as Student Advisors) but there are no punitive fines for breaking these rules.",

It's about allowing students to break the law and be held accountable/reported by their peers, instead of college administrators, RLCs, and CAs.  \n\nMy biggest fear is that this will drive drinking behind closed doors, to off campus housing, and to other private venues that are much more dangerous in regards to (1) sexual assault and (2) overdosing/alcohol poisoning. \n\nI always thought it was a good time to throw on some Netflix and drink with friends in some of the lounges. \n\nAlso, Norris should be bulldozed. It's honestly a terrible place. ",

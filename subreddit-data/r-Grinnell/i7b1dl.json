If not, I might have to resort to buying a router and modem so I can get much faster WiFi/Ethernet speeds.",

I'm sure that the farther you go from the initial router(or routers?), the worse quality it gets. But at the same time, Grinnell College is fairly big and this piques my interest.",

They've got a ton of bandwidth but in '06/'07 or so they started capping individual connections to low (but more than reasonable) limits. It may or may not have been related to some of us tunneling into the MathLAN network and downloading lots of stuff on usenet at ludicrous speed.\n\nAlso (unless they've changed stuff since I was there) you won't be able to use your own router/modem while on campus.",

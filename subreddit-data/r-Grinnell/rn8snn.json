(Barnard or Amherst )\nDid any of you re-apply after a gap year and got in?\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "I also agree. As much as I would love to see you on campus this fall, you have a better shot with Need-blind Amherst. They would probably give you a fighting chance unlike Grinnell which has been taking, on average, richer and richer students with each admissions cycle. Amherst is an amazing school in its own right!",

    "postText": "I was shocked and saddened when I opened the ominous 'Special Alumni Memo' earlier today and learned that my former academic advisor, Tyler Roberts, passed away yesterday (June 3).\n\nTyler was an astute advisor and an excellent educator. His classes, fueled by debate and discussion, rank among my favorite and most formative experiences from my time at Grinnell.\n\nI hope everyone in Religious Studies is doing okay.\n\nFuck.",

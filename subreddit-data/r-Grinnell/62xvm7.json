I'm a current student with a statistics concentration. I absolutely love statistics, and I referenced what I've learned (R, SAS, and lots of theory) to land a really prestigious paid government internship for this summer. I haven't taken many lab sciences at Grinnell, but the facilities look awesome. Most of my friends have science majors and have gotten to do independent research with professors and are competing for big research positions outside of Grinnell now. Lmk if you have questions!",

    "postText": "Basically title. Just caught syphilis in the latest campus outbreak. Went to donate plasma today, turns out you can't if you have an active syphilis infection! I usually use the cash they give me to finance my cigar addiction but now I can't donate for 8 weeks! I also got in a heated exchange with the nurse at the clinic and they threatened to ban me for life.\n\nWhat should I do? I'm not sure how I'm going to make it 8 weeks without my luxury cigars and I don't like working so can't earn money any other way. Does anyone know how you can hide an active syphilis infection from the blood tests they use? Maybe I should try drinking a few gallons of water before my next visit?\n\nThanks for your help guys,\n\nu/grinnellrepublican, signing off",

I caught it from my friend Deric's golf clubs and it seemed to spread everywhere immediately after that.\n\nThe convenience store, Almost Always Open (right down the street from the college) has nice cigars for dirt cheap. Might be worth checking out. Alternatively, if you go to the townie bar Rabbit's Tavern at 3:00am you'll find a ton of half smoked cigarettes all over the pavement. Put some in a ziploc and you are set! Not luxury cigars by any means but it'll get you your nic fix!\n\nI know you said you hate working but there are many ways to earn easy money on campus without having to work a minute. Maybe try setting up a luxury cigar club and getting SGA funding. They have more cash than they know what to do with and will pay you in no time! There are also many jobs on campus that require little to no work. Burling Circ desk attendant is one, so are half the positions in the SGA bureaucracy. I used to smoke cigars during my library shift and nobody batted an eye.\n\nHope this helps!",

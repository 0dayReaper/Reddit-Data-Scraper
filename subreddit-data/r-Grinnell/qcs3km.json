I really want to see if I am a fit and want to understand the qualitative aspects that Grinnell searches for in us kids. As a student from Dubai, I realize how far I am from Grinnell so it would be really helpful. Thanks :)",

            "comment": "If you want three words take the the first three adjectives but this should be of more help.\n\n1. Passionate about social justice; committed to aiding/expressing marginalized populations, especially through student government \n2. Excited to learn about a lot of different things in a lot of different ways, especially through research\n3. Personally Laid-back but determined to achieve meaningful careers to each individual\n\nA \u201cperfect fit\u201d for grinnell would be an aspiring double major in anthropology and computer science, who enjoys running for student office, meeting professors one on one, supporting the lgbtq community, drinking on the weekends, and playing ultimate frisbee, who also wants to go to law school and study abroad in Mongolia third year and London first year. There is no such thing as a perfect student for grinnell, but it affords you the place to do whatever you want in school and post graduation, although most students are generally characterized by the three sentiments above. The biggest things that mattered to me in my education though was how there are no course requirements outside of writing seminar, and how easy it was to study abroad. Will have done internships/studied on three continents before graduating.\n\nHope this helps.",

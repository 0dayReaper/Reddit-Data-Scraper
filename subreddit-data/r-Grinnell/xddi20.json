    "postText": "My daughter is finalizing her list of schools to apply to, and Grinnell would be right at the top if it weren't for the Iowa factor. She's pretty sure the campus environment would be accepting of a trans student, but is understandably nervous about most of the rest of the state.\n\nI know Grinnell is small, but: is there a trans community there? Is it thriving? Is it safe?\n\nThanks in advance...",

Grinnell also offers support groups and events for LGBTQ+ students and had a 24/7 counseling line.\n\nIf your daughter is really interested in going to Grinnell, and the only thing she's worried about is that, I wouldn't say it should sway her opinion :)",

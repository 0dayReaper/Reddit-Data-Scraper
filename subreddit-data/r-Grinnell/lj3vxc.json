I am still skeptical about this. Any admitted students from like CBSE or ICSE here? \n\nPS: I wrote my Why Grinnell about how Grinnell is a fun school that focuses simultaneously focuses on academics and how badly I want to attend it lol. Pls tell me it\u2019s okay \ud83d\ude33\n\nAnyways sorry for being annoying and hope to receive some answers to assure myself I won\u2019t get rejected \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

There's an FB page for admitted students, and discord as well. Mind if I ask around for Indian students and refer you to them?\n\nBtw I'm from Nepal, and we perhaps have pretty similar circumstances. So feel free to PM me if you have any questions! (You can also talk to me in Hindi if that's what you're comfortable in! \\^\\_\\^ )",

If you are skeptical about doing a non stem major, you have until end of soph year to make up your mind.\n\n3. Idt they care that much about the why grinnell essay , just write what excited you the most about grinnell and how you can benefit &amp; contribute to the community.\n\nHope this helps and good luck on your application!",

Redditors are people, too...\n\n\nAlso...as a grunchy alum, it is my duty throw some advice your way.\n\nDefinitely take CS classes if that's what you're interested in, but don't be afraid to explore things that are completely separate from sciences. (I'm a psych/neuro grad, but my favorite class at Grinnell was probably a German/Art History dual taught course about Berlin. Sweet stuff...)\n\nAlso, get out there and meet people when you first get to Grinnell. Join clubs, sit with new people in the d-hall, go to study breaks, etc. You'll meet some great people your first year. Keep your mind open, though, I didn't meet my best friends at Grinnell until I was a 2nd and 3rd year. \n\nAlso, go to Iowa City and Des Moines. For your sanity.\n\nAlso, Saints Rest is the shit. ",

[There's a FAQ](http://www.grinnellplans.com/documents/faq.html) that explains Plans' history, and the [[newbie](https://www.grinnellplans.com/read.php?searchname=newbie)] plan, but essentially, Plans provides you with a text box; you can write whatever you want in this text box.\n\nYou can use a small subset of HTML (b, i, u, s, tt, hr, and pre) and some Plans-specific markup for links, both to other plans and to other websites: link to another plan by enclosing the username in brackets like this: [plans]; this is called \"planlove\", and link to something else like this: [http://www\\.reddit.com/|reddit!]. \n\nMost people try to keep some standard layout for their Plan - I like to put a horizontal rule to separate days, and date-stamp my posts. (\"[date]\" gets autoconverted to the current date and time) This being Grinnell, there are no rules, and people frequently write in a much more disorganized fashion.\n\nWhen you update your plan, anyone who has put you on their autoread list will be notified - your username will show up as unread. To add someone to your autoread list, go to their Plan, scroll to the bottom, and click on one of the radio buttons other than \"X\". View a plan to mark it as read.\n\nA bunch of alumni and current students, as well as a handful of faculty, use Plans frequently - about 1500 people have updated in the last month, and many more lurk, or just use Plans for one of its features: Secrets.\n\nSecrets is a moderated anonymous bulletin board; postings are approved every Sunday. I'd estimate about a third of secrets are lies, but it's often really hard to tell. Sometimes they're hilarious, sometimes they're terrifying. Add it to your links in Preferences.\n\nSo: Jump in and write something. Use it like a blog. Use it like Twitter. You'll figure it out quickly enough.\n",

There's also a British guy coming in for the year who's cool. Really, the track for CS is incredibly linear and you can get it done in three years if you really want to go deep.

            "comment": "Be yourself is actually good advice - if they don\u2019t like you there\u2019s a good chance you won\u2019t like them! This isn\u2019t just a chance for them to get to know you, it\u2019s your chance to get to know them too. \n\nMain advice for all interviews: \n1. Don\u2019t over prepare, you\u2019ll seem scripted and robotic\n2. They are mostly looking to make sure you\u2019re normal and you aren\u2019t lying about you\u2019re extra curriculars \n3. Think of some questions you have about the school, especially anything you might have reservations about. You want to show them that you want to go to *their* school, not just any college that will accept you \n4. Right before the interview take some time to do something you enjoy that will take your mind off it so you can go in calm and collected; if you\u2019re calm you\u2019ve already got a leg up \n\nGood luck, I hope your interview goes well!",

    "postText": "Hey! I'm interested in applying to Grinnell, but it's so hard to find any Grinnell content online, so hopefully you can answer some of my questions : ) Feel free to answer only some since I so many :P\n\nI heard the work culture at Grinnell can be toxic. Are most students sleep-deprived? Is academics here really time-consuming? Any room for social life, clubs, activities, sports, etc.? Is there serious grade deflation?\n\nI've heard Grinnell is really heavy on drinking/substance - is this a large part of the campus culture? Do most students partake in some form?\n\nWhat are the most interesting courses you have taken/heard of? Clubs?\n\nWhat is the largest division on campus? Is it racial, socio-economic, varsity athlete and non-athlete, by major, etc.? Do students of different backgrounds and ethnicities interact regularly, or do students tend to self-segregate? Is Grinnell clique-y?\n\nHow is the location? I know it's in the middle of nowhere, but are there many nature-y things to do nearby/is it beautiful? I come from a large city and actually prefer a small town/rural campus. What are some of the advantages/disadvantages of Grinnell's location?\n\nWhat do you dislike most about Grinnell? What is something that surprised you when you just arrived on campus that you did not foresee?\n\nThank you!!",

            "comment": "1. It can be toxic but it's also what you make of it and depends on major. I don't recall serious grade deflation and had plenty of time outside of school. I definitely knew people that were perfectionist though and work took over.\n\n2. Yes, there isn't much to do so most people drink heavily and/or smoke. But there are plenty of sub free enclaves if you're into that.\n\n3. Take a CS course with Sam Rebelsky\n\n4. I graduated in the late 2000s but when I was there I suppose the biggest division was between science people and humanities people. Or maybe international students and US students. But it's a pretty homogeneous campus and I didn't find it clique-y.\n\n5. There is the prairie near by. But it's Iowa, it's mostly flat and farms. I thought the actual campus was beautiful though.\n\n6. What I disliked most was how little effort that the admin took in helping students with careers outside of grad school. You were pretty much on your own unless you were interested in the one company out of Wisconsin that recruited. The thing that surprised me was how small the town was. I was also surprised by how quickly I was friends with people from all over the country.\n\nBest of luck!",

                    "comment": "+1 on taking a CS course with Rebelsky. And to the rest of this - pretty much perfectly matches my own experience. Alcohol and substances were prevalent but also easy to avoid if you weren\u2019t interested. If I had to add anything: during my time there were frequent conflicts between the administration and the student body. I hope President Harris is a change from Kington in this regard, but my experience was that many non-academic staff had a \u201cyou\u2019ll be gone in four years tops, so your opinion doesn\u2019t matter\u201d mentality (especially ITS, the college IT department). Read up on the UGSDW union expansion fiasco too. This was probably the most frustrating thing about my time at Grinnell. \n\nGrinnell\u2019s alumni network is much stronger than that of many of its peer institutions. Alumni are frequently in touch with each other and almost always willing to help each other out.\n\nAnd...avoid the one company in Wisconsin that recruits.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a native Grinellian who is entering 8th grade at the local middle school. Fortunately, I can provide you an answer to Q5.\n\nWhen it comes to nature-like locations in this town, I can think of two. First off, South Campus.\n\nBehind the dorms, there are many trees ( I don\u2019t know if I should say \u201cmany\u201d since a storm on 8/10 snapped some of them) which contain some wildlife. I\u2018ve found some barred owls as well as some other birds in those locations.\n\nThe second place I can think of is Ahrens Park. \n\nThe whole place used to be a whole cornfield, but it was made into a park a few decades ago. I usually go there for jogs around the 1.5 mile trail that\u2018s around the perimeter of the park. The park also has an 8-field baseball/softball complex, a big hill for sledding in the winter, and a soccer complex\n\nI hope I gave you some good recommendations!",

            "comment": "I graduated 2 years ago.   \nI can't speak much about work culture. Most of my jobs were are research assistants. But from what I remember most students just treated the jobs as just that. I don't recall a \"culture\" per se.   \n\n\nAcademics do take up alot of time but it's not a waste. I learned alot from all the classes I took and that prepared me alot for law school. I've had to pull my share of all nighters to finish papers. But I think there is well enough time for social life. I met my closest friends and was involved with alot. I feel i had enough time to party, date, and study. On grade deflation. If you were a straight A student in high school you're prob not going to be in college. But that happens everywhere i think. You consistently being put into increasingly challenging stuff.  I was a consistent Bish student my years with occasional dips in both directions.   \n\n\nAlot of people in college drink and do drugs in my experience. But there is a good chunk that is sub free. I don't think I ever saw super heavy drugs. There was a group that organized \"sub free\" events on the weekends but i'm blanking on the name. I think you can have a worthwhile experience at grinnell sub or sub free.   \n\n\nBest courses that i remember: Film and Identity, Fashion, Sensation and perception, Psych Measurement, neoliberalism, Migration, psych seminair, and Poli Sci.   \n\n\nI think the one thing about being in a small community like grinnell is that you are going to meet and befriend people of all sorts of cultures and backgrounds. It'll force you to grow alot. That being said it's not perfect. I think people do tend to find what is comfortable in social settings. You'll generally have your core friend group and be on good terms with an extended group of people.  \n\n\nI do miss the campus alot some times. I lived in cities my whole life. It was great living in this idelic country small town. I had some of the best time just running around the neighborhood and campus. Advantages Is that everything is super close. You can walk downtown super easily and I started branching to the bars and local sites alot my third year.   \n\n\nWell I think i kinda fell into a rut academically. Like i floundered for a long until I found something I wanted. But already felt locked into psychology because that's what i started as. I'm now in a field that has nothing to do with my major so. Idk. I learned alot of core skills but alot of what i learned isn't applicable to me now. I wasn't expecting to change as much of a person as i did. I learned new things about myself and became a better person.   \n\n\ntldr. I love grinnell. It was a place that helped me grow and learn. I made alot of life long friends. But it may not be the place for everyone.",

            "comment": "I grew up in Grinnell, and applied and was accepted, but went to college elsewhere (a big university). The college absolutely dominates the town (the town wouldn't be there without the college), so I grew up very much in it's shadow. The other comments in this thread are accurate and I agree with them, but I'd like to add a couple things I think are missing.\n\nAbout the college: I would say divisions among students are very small. There is immense racial/ethnic diversity, and certainly no self-segregation. (When there are so few students, you are forced to hang out with the people around you, rather than finding your \"group.\") Athletics is not big at all, and there are no frats/sororities, so there is not much division there.\n\nAlso, Grinnell has a very strong, very politically liberal culture. Most of academia tends to already be pretty liberal relative to the US as a whole, but I'd put Grinnell College at the 90th percentile relative to other small colleges. (As an example, Grinnell's \"Student Dining Workers Union\", the only student worker's union in the country, recently pushed to unionize the entire campus.) This culture itself is not bad (I'm quite liberal myself), but dissent (questioning the orthodoxy) is taboo, especially in the humanities. As much they purport to be about discussion and debate, with my interaction with students and faculty there, that is not the case, and their minds have been made up. Do not go to Grinnell expecting to learn from the full gamut of political thinking.\n\nAbout the town/area:\n\nDo not confuse \"rural\" with \"nature\". Nearly all of Iowa is developed farmland, and there is very little undeveloped nature for hiking, biking, etc.. All the rural roads are very dusty and use coarse gravel, so they're not very nice for biking or whatever. I contrast this with places like San Francisco, which are surrounded by public parks, extensive bike trails, and pristine nature. Recreating outside of the town requires considerable driving to the few-and-far-between state parks, which themselves are very small. There truly is not much to do besides being at the college, which is a big advantage if you want to be highly focused on academics.\n\nGrinnell is also 1hr from the (small) airport in Des Moines, which has few direct flights to anywhere. So if you live in, say, Boston or San Diego, expect getting home to be a lengthy and expensive ordeal, requiring at least one layover every time. There are direct flights to La Guardia, O'Hare, Denver, DFW, ATL, and a couple seasonal ones like Las Vegas, but that's about it.\n\nI think my tone may be a bit negative (perhaps I've been in Grinnell's shaddow for too long), but it's still an excellent college where you will befriend loads of smart and interesting people. I still recommend applying and seeing what scholarships/financial aid you get (I got a more generous package than I expected), even if you think  you may not go there. They have an \"admitted student weekend\" in the spring where you can hang out with other admitted students, sit in on classes, and get a much better feel for the place, before you commit. I found that very helpful.\n\nGood luck!",

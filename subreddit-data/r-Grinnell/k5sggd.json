Everyone I\u2019ve talked to has had a super nice experience there and something important is that bc it\u2019s not really a \u201cdesirable\u201d location, all the kids genuinely WANT to be there",

            "comment": "Hello, OP!  I hope you are doing well!  Due to coronavirus and because I am a first year, I unfortunately don\u2019t have much information on campus life.  However, I wanted to say congratulations!  We are lucky to have you here, and welcome to Grinnell College!\n\nFrom what I hear from upperclassmen, the city of Grinnell is quite tiny, so most big events take place either on the campus or in the major cities in Iowa like Des Moines or Cedar Rapids.  However, I\u2019ve been told that there\u2019s still a considerable amount of chances to interact with the city since it is really small, meaning you get to become familiar with a smaller space over time! \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n\nHave a nice day!",

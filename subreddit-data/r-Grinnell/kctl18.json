They're pretty nice, oldest dorms on campus but not decrepit like the south dorms.\n\nStudents here love a lot of things: tennis, swimming, squirrels, weed, video games etc. So I'd say the love relationships are pretty good.\n\nNot sure how the \"girls\" are like but I've had sexual intercourse with about 15 squirrels on the campus and that's been pretty good.",

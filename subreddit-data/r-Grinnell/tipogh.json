And if so do they cost?",

In all honesty, most students (me included) have a heavy workload that doesn't allow them to go away for the weekends, so keep that in mind.  The most my friends and I can manage on a normal weekend is a few hours in Iowa City at Costco/Trader Joe's/out for a meal and then back to Grinnell.",

There are shuttles to the airport, but they only run at the beginning of breaks. they fill up pretty quickly. flights out of des moines are also really expensive since it\u2019s such a small airport, which is also something to keep in mind.",

I've literally joined the thumbs down Facebook page and everything, but it seems like such a good school for me. Free music lessons, a culture of discovery and being yourself. The only reason why I'm trying to not go here is because my family really wants me to go to the large local state school, but I can't. I don't see people like myself there, you know ?",

She was involved in a variety of interesting activities, had lots of interesting, diverse friends that continue to support and see each other after graduation.  She had very special relationships with professors and mentors with whom she keeps in touch.  She currently is in law school at a top 20 law school where she received a lot of aid.  if Grinnell fits, go for it.  You will not regret it!",

The location absolutely does not matter, when you're on campus you won't feel like you're in the middle of nowhere iowa. You will definitely find your niche and clubs of your interest. There's also only one required class, the freshmen tutorial, and the rest is open curriculum. The professors are great and motivated and so so smart. I loved every second of my time here, no regrets whatsoever",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,\nI am a current student, fourth year to be exact, am writing to prospective students and their parents/guardians about the recent events in Grinnell. You deserve to know.\nAlthough Grinnell prides itself on social justice, diversity, and academics, there are major systemic issues here that will greatly impede with your education here.\nRacism on campus and off campus has gotten worse and worse over my four years here. Currently, students\u2019 cars and college property is being vandalized with racial slurs and threats. Black students and other students of colour get harassed but not only a select group of townspeople but also by their fellow students. By harassed, I mean they are experiencing racial slurs being hurled at them at college events and and a truck with a confederate flag often comes through campus to yell at students as well. Additionally, micro aggressions are rampant in the classroom. Grinnell has a reactionary approach to all the things stated. Administration does not hold racist students accountable what so ever and blames people of colour.\nSecondly, there have multiple suicide attempts and unfortunately one student died by suicide yesterday. Rather than addressing this issue, all Grinnell did was send condolence emails and told students to talk to counselors. Professors were encouraged to cancel class or hold space for traumatized students but many didn\u2019t. Life at Grinnell resumed as usual while students are having to come to terms with the fact that their friend has died. Some professors even chastised students for missing class because of this horrific event. This institution cares more about academic rigor than students\u2019 mental health. This has proven to be dangerous and will continue to cost lives.\nGrinnell is broken and students here are rapidly declining in their well-being.",

            "comment": "Actually, the institution took a lot of measures to deal with the racist harassment (some well thought out, some not so much). For example, they have dramatically increased the availability of college-sponsored transportation (meaning students don't have to walk around in town if they don't want to, though from the information that's been shared it sounds like there are probably one or two people responsible for the harassment). Most professors didn't cancel class when a student died because they instead sent out emails saying anyone who did know him or who was affected by this news should feel free to not attend. \n\nHowever, for anyone who's reading this, if you go to Grinnell a significant number of people view themselves as activists and do not like the idea that an institution is making reasonable efforts to support them.",

Multiple professors have berated students for missing classes due to suicide of a student and also because of racism on campus. \n\nNot to mention, instead of advocating for students, the offices of academic affairs and students affairs gave students these options 1. get a planner 2. drop classes 3. leave grinnell/drop out. This is not the behavior of an institution that cares about their students.",

Remember that prof that has multiple cases of harassment to the point where he has to have open door office hours? Still here (tho on leave for research)? Remember that student who hurled racial slurs at an all campus dance? Still here. Remember convicted rapists being allowed to be on campus and no contact orders not being enforced? The list goes on and on and on",

I'm curious what \"berated\" actually means. Also, yes, if someone is going to be unable to make it to class indefinitely due to grief they should withdraw, and here that might be true if the time period we're talking about is more than a week or two. It's not uncompassionate to say so.",

The college has made a significant effort to support its students in both cases - increasing transportation ability and resources due to the racism issue and sending out biweekly updates on their efforts to make campus safer, and holding a memorial service after the death of the student. Most professors sent out emails telling students they were welcome to miss class due to grief. You will probably hear a decent amount of this kind of thing, but it is a result of the high population of students who would like to be activists and are somewhat hampered in this by the college being on their side.",

I was also told that the lifeguard position was the highest paid position on campus.  It paid at a rate of $12.00 per hour.\n\nTo answer your question though, I often found jobs within my academic department(which is Physics).  In third and fourth years at Grinnell, I worked as a Lab assistant and later as a mentor.  Those type of positions are normally great for people who aspired to go to Grad School(like me).\n\nUsing Handshake, I think you can find administrative positions at CLS, HR, Institute of Global Engagement, The Wilson Foundation, the Rosenfield and other places that aren't too familiar to most students at Grinnell College. Those positions might give you the opportunity to meet some pretty well-connected people.\n\nAs for D-Hall, I personally never worked there.  I have heard a lot of stories from people that say that the work sucked.  But I have heard from others that the work is pretty wholesome.  If you are interested, I strongly advise you to join UGSDW!  My friend started that when he was there and it served great effective counterbalance against the administration.",

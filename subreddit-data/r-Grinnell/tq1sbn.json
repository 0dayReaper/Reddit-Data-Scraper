    "postText": "Asking because I know Grinnell has a very generous financial aid policy but am still worried about applying ED (for 2023 school year) and potentially not getting a very good financial aid offer, or an offer that's manageable but just barely while another school might give something better.\n\nThe financial aid calculator on the Grinnell website estimated  my family's net price as $3, 500 / year, so wondering if any students know how accurate that calculator is, how generous Grinnell tends to be with aid or if it's a good or bad idea to apply ED if I'm depending on aid?\n\nObviously I have quite a few months to think about this but just trying to get an idea of my plans early.

My financial aid has adjusted a bit, even though my EFC hasn\u2019t really changed that much, but the financial aid department is surprisingly very helpful and they helped ease my concerns when I was applying and also up to now. \n\nHopefully this gives you some insight!",

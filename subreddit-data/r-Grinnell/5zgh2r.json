    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nMy gf graduated from Grinnell and i wanted to surprise her with some of her favorite coffee from McNallys. I was fortunate to visit her twice her last year there and I loved the coffee too. The only problem is that I can't remember the preground coffee they have there! I know one of them is Mississippi Mud and I think the other one has cow in the name? It would really help me out if anyone knows.\n\nLoved the school, thanks guys ",

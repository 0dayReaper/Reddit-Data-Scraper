    "postText": "Hi, I'm a committed incoming student for the class of 2026. The more research I do, and post visits etc, the more concerned I'm becoming about the political climate. While I'd say my actual beliefs are generally pretty left-wing, I'm critical of a lot of aspects of the social justice movement and definitely have some libertarian leaning views. My beliefs aren't particularly extreme, but I hold them pretty strongly and I'm starting to get the impression that because of that I'm unlikely to be successful in making friends here, potentially to the point where I should try and consider another path for higher education because being friendless in the middle of nowhere for 4 years would be miserable. On a similar note, I'm worried I will not be able to express my views openly without risking teachers treating my work more aggressively or giving me lower grades for pieces of the same quality as a more traditionally left-wing student's. Is there anyone on this sub who's anything other than left-wing and pro-social justice, and if so how are you doing, or how are you expecting to do?",

Going there is a cultural shakeup, and your coursework, atmosphere, and new people will probably change quite a bit about what you believe. Speaking from personal experience, the way I think about the world now is radically different than when I was a first year. But, again, _that's the point_: being around people who are different than you is just as much a learning experience as going to class. Embrace it, and be open-minded.",

                    "comment": "&gt;As for making friends, I think you should \u2014 sooner rather than later \u2014 think about why you wrote this:\n\nThere are two main reasons. The first is that I've already had a lot of exposure to social justice and the left as a whole, and I don't expect that more of those same ideas which I've grown up around and increasingly disliked will cause me to suddenly stop having issues with a lot of principles that I find concerning- for example, I place a lot of importance on personal freedom, and that has both always been true of me and seems to be at odds with many people in these particular circles who I've encountered, who seem to be much more collectivist. (Please don't nitpick this point, I have a lot of issues with social justice that are more fundamentally at odds with the concept.)\n\nThe second is that I'm not saying none of my opinions will ever change, but I would like to go to college to be exposed to ideas across the political spectrum and beliefs that are new to me, rather than only those I'm already familiar with, and to have the freedom to develop my own views with new information. If I encountered strong presentations of both left-wing and right-wing ideas and became more left-wing naturally, I wouldn't see that as a bad thing, but it seems like here my options are to move left, to never even offhandedly mention my beliefs outside of a few close friends if I can find them, or to be more or less an outcast. Moving right because of information I encounter seems to not even be on the radar.",

You will meet _people_ with _individual needs, beliefs, and modes of expression_, and you're all part of the same community. It _sounds_ like you've had bad experiences with some people (which may have been justified, I'm not sure) and are steeping in libertarianism as a result, but don't go into college in a defensive posture. If you do, you'll realize your fears \u2014 being acidic and bitter toward people because you think you'll be typecast because of your views is foolish (and ironically doing exactly what you're worried other people will do!). Connect with _people_ first on a _human_ level!\n\nYou're also going to be exposed to left- and right-wing ideas, including in your coursework. You'll be learning about them in an environment pretty different from previous ones, where you'll focus on intellectually excavating things and figuring stuff out as a class, with guidance from an expert in the subject. Again, when you say you're \"familiar with\" these social and political ideas (by which I assume you mean \"social justice\" and \"the left\"), I guarantee that you don't know as much as you think you do. Learning about them in an academic setting focused on historical and contextual understanding is likely _far_ different than the interactions you've had before \u2014\u00a0again, _do not go into college in a defensive posture_. The ideas you're \"familiar\" with are going to be recontextualized, better-defined, and subject to more academic rigor than you have experienced. That isn't a knock on you, though! I went through a very similar transition, and it just takes time and experience to learn how to learn these things.\n\nAlso, I'm curious: if you're worried about \"social justice\" and \"the left,\" why did you apply to a private abolitionist college committed to furthering those causes? This isn't meant to be rhetorical, I'm genuinely interested!",

Most people I knew also suggested that a small school would make it easier to make friends, though I'm starting to wonder if I should have trusted that, as I'm concerned it could just as easily lead to few options and a cliquey atmosphere. I also am okay with being in the minority, just not with being harassed or outcasted over it.\n\nAnd yes, I've had very negative experiences in the past and am frustrated by the idea of being forced into a particular belief system by social pressure rather than by learning about various ideologies in a balanced way and making choices for myself without worrying that disagreement with the majority will make me an outcast. I'd be much more willing to entertain ideas relating to social justice if I felt I could just as easily entertain the opposite ones.",

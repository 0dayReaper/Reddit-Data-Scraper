You can tell that they care about students deeply. \n\nAs for \"boring\", Grinnell college and the student orgs do a great job of bringing fun to campus. Food and location can get boring at times, but I've had a ton of fun in Grinnell so far overall.",

There are many groups and activities on campus for people like me and in all honesty, it hasn't bothered me much, if at all. Please do note that I live on East Campus so it's much quieter in these dorms. People find their own fun.\n\nEdit: want to also add that the school's pretty liberal, so many are very open to \"exploring new experiences\", but everyone is very respectful of others' cultures, beliefs, and choices. In addition: drugs will be on every college campus around the globe, so don't worry about it too much.",

While I never participated in them when I was at Grinnell, I did come to accept that drugs, and students taking them, were simply a part of college.\n\nIf you are person to avoid drugs, rather than participate in them, then I can affirm to you that there are places in Grinnell where you can stay away from it all.  However, I am not sure to what extent Grinnell students take drugs in comparison to students at other colleges.",

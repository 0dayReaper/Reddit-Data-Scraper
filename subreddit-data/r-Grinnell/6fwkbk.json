    "postText": "I'm moving to Grinnell from NY, and out here we've got Spectrum (formerly Time Warner) which I've never had a problem with. Given the location, how good is the wireless situation?\n\nLooked up Mediacom which apparently has monthly usage caps?? Da hell. And Windstream who seems to have varied results? Any others worth looking into? I have a basic 15 kbps plan here which has never failed me for the basics (email, browsing, streaming movies, etc) so looking for something similar. Thank you!",

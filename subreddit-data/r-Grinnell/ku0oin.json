E.g. \"15.27 (4.0 equivalent)\" or similar. The applications office is accustomed to dealing with different grading systems for international students. \n\nAlso, Grinnell has two Ls in the name, so I'd double-check you're spelling the school's name right in your application materials. :)",

Because they're all familiar with the international grading system. My two cents... \n\nAre you applying RD?",

    "postText": "I am an international prospective stdeunt.\n\nHow is the culture in Grinnell like? Like clubs and all, and it's acceptance rates. And, other opportunities. How rigorous the courses are? Grinnell says it ensures that we will only be in classes that we want to be in... what do you all think about that? Do we actually get to study only the courses we want?   \n\n\nI could get answers from college's website but hearing from students themselves is quite a different thing.  \nThank you in advance. I really love Grinnell and am looking forward to applying in it, that too in ED. So I just wanted to hear the goodness from the current students themselves.",

Of course,  there isn't time to participate in everything due to classes and the number of hours in the day,  so you'll have to  ration your attention. So far, my experience with classes has been great as well. I personally think that taking some variety in courses makes the academics here really interesting,  but it's true that nobody will force you to sign up for a specific class unless it's tutorial.",

You will find Grinnellians that care deeply about lots of different ideas, people, classes etc.  And a genuine sense of interest in all kinds of things.  There's a ridiculous amount of variety in people here too. I'm actually from Iowa,  but I now live on a campus where the minority of people are from this state. As a result,  there are a lot of perspectives on campus,  and I haven't met anyone who isn't fascinating in some way. I hope that helps. I'm sorry if it sounds a bit canned.",

You still have to meet the credit requirements of your major (usually 32 credits aka 8 semester-long courses) to graduate, but other than that all the rest of your credits can come from whichever courses you want.",

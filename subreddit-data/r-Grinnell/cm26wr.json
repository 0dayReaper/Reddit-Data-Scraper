    "postText": "Hey everyone! So I was thinking of applying to Grinnell and I just wanted to know your honest review of the school. How's diversity? Is anyone left out? How good is life for international students? Any rundown housing? How good is the campus? How is the general mood? Can someone who won't be attending parties still find company? Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Lots of diversity.\n\nYes.\n\nNo different than it is for domestic students. If you need accommodations, you'll have someone to talk to so that you can get your particular situation sorted.\n\nAll the on-campus dorms are in good shape as far as I know. YMMV with off-campus housing.\n\nCampus is beautiful and very walkable. If you haven't been there yet, you need to set up a campus visit.\n\nThey're a bunch of stressed out college students who work hard Monday-Friday and then do stupid shit on the weekends to blow off stress. Lots of people end up feeling anxious and neurotic because of all the work and all the pressure, but there are resources on campus to help deal with your anxiety. It just depends whether you use them.\n\nYou can still find plenty of like-minded people to hang out with, even if you don't attend parties, but the entire campus sounds like a loud party on Saturday night, so it's not always possible to get away from it entirely depending on where you live. East Campus is quieter than North or South Campus.",

In addition to just the fact that they'll be pretty much the only contact you'll have, which obviously sucks by itself, there are just so, so many issues with this plan. For one, you could just not get along with your group and go the entire semester with no friends. What if you get stuck with someone you deeply dislike, or worse, who makes you particularly uncomfortable? As I understand it, you're meant to go to classes with your group, which will almost certainly involve significant restrictions on what classes you can take. I could go on.",

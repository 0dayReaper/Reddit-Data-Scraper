Especially being in Iowa, have you noticed anything beneficial about being an undergrad amidst the Iowa politics environment? \n\nHow\u2019s undergraduate research opportunities like? \nHow difficult is the program?",

            "comment": "My daughter graduated from Grinnell last year.  She majored in Political science and loved it.  It is a wild place to be as all of the presidential candidates come through Iowa and stop at Grinnell, sometimes more than once.  She was very involved int the Hiliary campaign. She also was very involved in the Liberal arts in Prison program where she taught classes and tutored students in prison.  That ignited her passion for justice system reform  and she is now in law school pursuing that passion.  She spent one summer doing a research project with a professor and was very close to a lot of her professors who were excellent.  Hope this is helpful.",

Being in Iowa was great, though if you are more interested in international politics there won\u2019t be as many options. I didn\u2019t do a MAP project or big research project but the options were there. Hope that helps. Maybe a more recent alum will give more current feedback.",

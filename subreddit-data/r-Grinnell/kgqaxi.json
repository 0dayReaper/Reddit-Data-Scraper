    "postText": "Hi! I will be applying to Grinnell as an international applicant. I just had a few questions about the college before applying.\n\n1) I require a lot of financial aid. How is the financial aid for international students at Grinnell?\n\n2) I will be applying as a CS major. How is the CS major at Grinnell? What are the internship opportunities, job placements, and grad school placements like?\n\n2) What are the best and worst things about Grinnell?\n\nThank you!",

Unfortunately, Grinnell is still need aware for internationals, which means this can be a disadvantage when applying and requesting financial aid.  It\u2019s unfortunate, and I hope this changes in the future.  On the bright side, though, they do meet full demonstrated need and are loan free, so if you get in, they will likely be able to provide for you. In my experience, they are quite generous and offer good amounts of merit aid too.\n\n2. I\u2019m unfortunately not a STEM major, so I\u2019m not too experienced with their STEM courses, but the outcomes from my understanding are quite good, and I hear a lot of good things about the CS classes.  You can also pursue Mentor Advanced Programs or MAPs during college where you can research any topic you\u2019re interested in and receive salary.  Grinnell also publishes their data for grad school and employment by major!  You can see the one for CS majors according to Grinnell\u2019s CLS.  https://www.grinnell.edu/after-grinnell/graduate-outcomes/computer-science\n\n3. I\u2019m only a first year, so I haven\u2019t been here too long, but the biggest pet peeve I have experienced is that since Grinnell is small, many courses are only offered once or twice a year, and when a course is popular, it is extremely difficult to get into it, and it can be quite frustrating.  On the flip side, though, Grinnell\u2019s smallness is one of the best things about the community.  The people I meet here have been extremely welcoming and friendly, and the upperclassmen that I have met have all been so helpful.  Even with everything online, my class feels very tight knit, and our GroupMe is quite active!\n\nGood luck to you with applying to Grinnell.  I\u2019m wishing you the best and hope to see you next year.  Hope this helped!\n\nHave a nice day!",

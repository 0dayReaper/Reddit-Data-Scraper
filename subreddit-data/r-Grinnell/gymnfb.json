    "postText": "After hearing that many Ivy League schools are receiving no higher than a D+ grade for student mental health, what grade would any of you (current students) give Grinnell in terms of student mental health? I understand that Grinnell isn't on the exact same level as Ivy League, but it is up there.\n\nAnyway, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Of course, if you're not comfortable sharing that's okay.",

                    "comment": "To add on to the Misery Olympics:\n\nI'm also a student here and have fallen into the Misery Olympics. It's very easy to do so, but a majority of the student body is in it too so we kind of go through it together. The school did warn us about the risks and vulnerability of it, and told us that it is very possible to go through Grinnell without going through the Misery Olympics. During New Student Orientation, they said a (certain, I don't remember) percentage of Students can do all their work without pulling all nighters. It just takes a lot of grit and will power.\n\nMy intro to sociology professor told us this during our first paper assignment of the course: \"Getting a C+, B-, B on a paper is EXPECTED. That is average here, and everyone here is already above average at their high schools. Getting an A- is hard but doable. We/I rarely grade papers with A+ marks unless it is a perfect draft when submitted that I want to co publish it right away because it is perfect with no errors. Obviously that rare.\" \n\nOf course, professors are subjective, but this point isn't entirely wrong. I can vouch for it. \n\nThere is also a sort of \"work hard, play hard\" culture here. Monday through Friday, everyone is focused on classes and grinding their work. When their last class ends on a Friday, everyone lightens up and probably goes to some party, school event, or get together. Saturday people let loose, again either relax or go to a party, school event, or get together at night. On Sunday, everyone wakes up around noon for brunch and campus is 'dead' again. Everyone is quiet, studying, catching up on the following weeks work. Rarely anyone is doing any partying or socializing despite it being a weekend day technically. I've never seen more people working inside our humanities building than on a Sunday to be honest. So the tough, rigorous academic mentality goes from Sunday through  mid day Friday and repeats.\n\nI can't speak for personal mental health issues and the resources provided because I haven't gone through much of that and reached out. I hope this helps, but doesn't demoralize you haha. It's easy to fall into the Misery Olympics in anything, really.",

            "comment": "I'm not gonna lie, mental health at Grinnell isn't always the best. \n\nLike u/randomuserwhateverthenumberwas mentioned, it's a lot of work, but the relaxed atmosphere and awesome people make it way more tolerable. However, getting access to mental healthcare can be really hard, if only due to the sheer isolation of Grinnell (the nearest psychiatrist is a 30 minute drive). The college does its best to make resources available on campus, but while I don't speak from experience, I've heard from more than one friend that the counselors aren't qualified to deal with truly serious mental health needs, and have been known to overreact in a counterproductive way. I doubt it would be worse than a D+ though, and for less serious issues it's probably pretty good. \n\nThat said, the college absolutely recognizes its deficiencies and is doing a lot to fix them. In fact, we just got a *huge* grant specifically dedicated to student mental health that worked out to over $10,000 per student. I imagine that means we'll see a massive increase in the quality and quantity of resources made available; maybe even a psychiatrist on staff, who knows?",

            "comment": "I graduated in '17 but sat on the Mental Health Task Force. Grinnell has a problem of being an extremely small and intense school, as folk have already said in this thread, but generally the biggest flaw in Grinnell mental health is the lack of resources.\n\nGrinnell has a history of being unable to keep psychologists or psychiatrists on staff due to being extremely overworked (and not paid enough for it). A lot of this is just Grinnell being in the middle of nowhere - no one wants to work there. It's hard to find a life partner when living in Grinnell, take care of your own mental health, etc. Especially if you start looking for mental health providers that are not just white cishet women.\n\nGrinnell actually has a very high depression rate and suicidality rate, looking at the survey that was done in either '16 or '17 on mental health. While people are laid back, this is a time in your life when some mental illnesses do emerge as well as folks first time being away from home (and generally needing a therapist to deal). Grinnell used to have a suic*de approximately every 5 years, but unless I've missed one it's been over 10 now. Things have gotten a bit better with time. It also is *better* than a lot of the colleges like Yale and such; I can't speak to their statistics cause Grinnell was unique in running the mental health survey on its own, but I recall a year where there were three unrelated suic*des there. \n\nI obviously can't speak to how it's changed since I've graduated, but from what I've heard it is still bad. If you have a car you can get to DSM or IC to see a psychiatrist if you need meds, but it's extremely hard to get any sort of specialized treatment.\n\nI can speak more to the past obviously; feel free to DM.",

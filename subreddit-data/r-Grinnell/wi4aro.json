    "postText": "Hi there, I'm coming to Grinnell this fall and have been assigned to a \"mini co-op\" with three other people. I can't find any resources on the website about the living situation in one of these. Does anyone know what these rooms look like? I was just wondering if people have semi-seperate spaces or all four people sleep in the same room. I saw they have their own bathrooms (and maybe kitchens) but I don't know anything about the layout of the room otherwise. Any details would be appreciated.",

That said, they should all be in there somewhere so keep your eyes open",

We're always looking for new additions to our little cornfield menagerie of misfit toys :).",

It's most important that your passion and excitement about various things come out in your answers. \n\nIn general, remember that Grinnell is looking to find out about *you* during the interview, and the simple \"be yourself, but go in with a few bullet point things you'd like to mention at some point\" is very much the best approach.\n\nBest of luck, with the interview and the rest of the application process!",

I got in with a merit scholarship. The CS department also explicitly tailors the intro sequence to remove any edge students might have from previous HS experience - the first course is in Scheme which most folk have zero experience in. It's an intentional choice for the department to promote enquity and diversity in tech.",

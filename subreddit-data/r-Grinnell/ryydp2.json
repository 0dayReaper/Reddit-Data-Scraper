    "postText": "Idk what it is but it's freaking me out I applied ED2 to Grinnell and although they've never bombarded me with emails I don't like the suspense and the eerie silence. I'm scared I'll get rejected just like my ED1 choice \ud83d\ude27\ud83d\ude27\n\nNow, the Qs \n1) Does Grinnell have a good finance/ Econ department ? If anyone has taken some classes or have graduated y'all could answer.\n2) I really want to get into banking so does Grinnell have a good network in the finance industry ?\n3) How's the social life like there ? Are there good bars and restaurants around ? \n4) Is sports big there ? If not what is ?",

I know some people may be disappointed with the intro, but I strongly suggest taking the second course in the major (lower 200 levels) because that's what sparked my interest in pursuing the major!  \n\nI'm not sure how Reddit works (it's my first time using it) but if there is a dm option, lemme know if you have any other questions :)",

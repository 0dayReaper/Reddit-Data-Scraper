    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nI'm committed to Grinnell and, in preparation for filling out my housing survey, I was wondering if you could describe the 3 areas and the dorms in them? I was able to find one single college confidential thread describing North as athletics + alcohol, East as sterile + nerds, South as weed + hippies, but not only is that fairly reductive, the thread is 12 years old. If anyone has more up to date information on what the areas are like and what goes on in individual dorms I'd love to hear it!\n\nthanks.",

            "comment": "I just graduated in \u201820, and overall I would say those generalizations largely hold up. There\u2019s one sub free dorm in each section (N,E, and S), and it seems like those are all pretty similar to each other in that they\u2019re quieter than the neighbors. East\u2019s doors close automatically so that kinda shuts down community there to a degree (you have to be really intentional about reaching out to people, you can\u2019t just walk by and say hello). \n\nNorth is kinda the athlete group since it\u2019s close to the bear, but I lived there as a non-athlete and it was just fine. My friends in south were definitely more into drugs/weed. for a while, Main on south campus (I think) happened to have a lot of queer students for some reason, but there were queer students everywhere so idk\n\nHope this helps, but you can dm me if you want more info",

Never did find it). \n\nNothing much to add, haven't been back in a long time. It is pretty amazing that not only have those reputations held up, they've persisted past the addition of East. We just had North/South as beer + sports / weed + hippies. Generally the more studious/quiet options were those closest to the academic buildings.",

She had some longitudinal data grouped by dorms, and there were significant differences between them that persisted over time. I guess that\u2019s just the long way of saying the data support your hypothesis lol",

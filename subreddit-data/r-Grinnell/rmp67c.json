    "postText": "Hey, any physics majors at Grinnell? I'm looking to apply in a small school for physics but heard that each school has super different students, so I'd just like to meet the students in the physics department since that will be the biggest variable in my decision. How are physics students at Grinnell like? What's the culture within the department, and how would it differentiate from other LACs? Thanks!",

If you're interested in research, I heard that they're very accommodating which is a bonus :) I have asked a few (intended) physics major friends to help you out :)",

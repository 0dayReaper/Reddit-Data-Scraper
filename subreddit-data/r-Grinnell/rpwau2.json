    "postText": "Heyy, I'm an international student with a low efc (8k). I was wondering if I should still apply ED 2 to Grinnell or look at some other college? My SAT is 1420. \n\nA grinnell alumni will be writing me a personal letter of recommendation but that's about all the advantage I would have at Grinnell. Is grinnell good with providing such large amount of financial aid?",

            "comment": "The good news: If you get in, Grinnell will give you good aid. Grinnell meets full-need, and gives very generous financial aid packages to both domestic and international students.\n\nThe bad news: Grinnell is not need-blind for international students. Thus, it will be more difficult for you to get into Grinnell.",

                            "comment": "To my understanding, the financial aid packages for international students are lower because Grinnell tends to admit higher income international students. Because they are not need-blind, it is much harder to get in as an international student seeking large amounts of aid. Thus, higher income international students tend to get in more often and therefore average aid is lower for international students. Of course if someone else knows better, please correct me.",

I did a great interview though, they admitted another student in my school with a higher efc ( ig 15k). I know an egyptian guy who got in with full aid with an efc of 3k but on ED1.\nAlthough, wesleyan did give a bunch of full rides last year, Hamilton was also quite generous. (Check last year's decision megathread)\nDm me if you need more details!",

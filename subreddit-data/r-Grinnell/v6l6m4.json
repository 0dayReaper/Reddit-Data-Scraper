Went to the place, wanked in a cup, the whole shabang. The guys said they would call me, but that night I dropped my phone in the toilet so I no longer have access to my number. Anyone know how I can get my results without having access to my number?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I just found a number of suspicious sores and I have a rash on my palms. I'm really worried...what should I do?",

There is also a Planned Parenthood in DSM. And I believe there is a similar type of clinic in Marshalltown (not technically PP but similar.) \nI would see a professional ASAP.",

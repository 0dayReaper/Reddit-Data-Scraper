    "postText": "Hey guys! I was offered a spot on the waitlist for the class of 2025, and I'm very interested in attending. However, I've been putting off writing my LOCI for them, and now that I've written it, I have no clue what to do with it. Do I just send it to my admissions counselor? Also, I'm worried that its late submission might put me at a disadvantage. What else can I do to increase my chances of getting off the waitlist? Any help is appreciated!",

You can send the LOCI to your regional AO if you\u2019d like or you can submit to the person who signed off your waitlist result letter.\n\nYou\u2019re also probably okay submitting the LOCI now.  It\u2019s not too late at all as they usually make waitlist decisions in May or in the summer.  Some other things you can do as well outside of submitting a LOCI could be to submit your final high school transcript once final grades come out!\n\nGood luck with the waitlist, and I truly hope you get into Grinnell.\n\nHave a nice day!",

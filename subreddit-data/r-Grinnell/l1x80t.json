            "comment": "Hey, OP!  I hope you are doing well, and since the essay is 100 words only, I don\u2019t think the AOs would be too strict about what you talk about.  Since it might be too little space to talk about your major, I recommend talking about one of the aspects that Grinnell offers, such as the open curriculum/individually advised curriculum, the first year tutorial course, anything about Grinnell\u2019s location, or a specific course offered at Grinnell that you haven\u2019t noticed offered anywhere else, etc.\n\nGood luck with the essay!  Hope it works out.\n\nHave a nice day!",

It's mainly used to determine who is really serious about applying and who is demonstrating interest since Grinnell doesn't have an application fee. Just be honest and write about one of the things you look forward to if given the opportunity to attend. Hope this helps!",

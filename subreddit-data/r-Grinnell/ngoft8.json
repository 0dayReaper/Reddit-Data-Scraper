            "comment": "I strongly recommend picking a tutorial with a subject that interests you rather than worrying about who the professor is. While the point of your first year tutorial is partly to get you up-to-speed with college-level work, it also forms a social/academic group that you will hopefully continue to meet with after your first year. Having a common interest will help! You will have plenty of time to take classes with that one rock-star professor down the line\u2014hopefully once you've had a chance to meet them.\n\nWhile your tutorial professor is your default academic advisor, this changes the second you declare your major.\n\nAll that said, I've heard great things about Comrades in the Kitchen (Armstrong) and have great respect for Caleb Elfenbein.",

            "comment": "I had Professor Tavares twice in my first year, and Professor Erickson for a class on AI, and they were both absolutely amazing!  In particular looking at the tutorial topics, if you are interested in learning about the relationship between humans and AI or the philosophy and sociology behind AI, I cannot recommend Professor Erickson\u2019s tutorial enough!  Her I/Robot course was really amazing and one of my favorite classes here.  She is also super kind.  Professor Tavares is also an incredibly kind and really sweet person, so if you love filmmaking or cinema, that is also a fantastic choice, and I have no doubt that she would be a great advisor.\n\nGood luck with your choice!\n\nHave a nice day!",

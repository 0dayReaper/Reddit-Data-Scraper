Seceda was my favorite, and there are tons of trails up there that you can use to make your hike as long or as short as you wish. You can also hike down from Seceda into the towns. The trails are well marked and there are rifugios along the way with food and water. We did however, run into later afternoon thunder and lightning storms, so just check the weather forecast or the lift live cameras the days you plan to hike.",

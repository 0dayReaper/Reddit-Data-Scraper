    "postText": "I\u2019m going to Peru for about a month in July/Aug and I\u2019m already obsessing over what I will bring. I always overpack but I\u2019ve really got to fight the urge as I will need to bring a lot of hiking stuff (fleece, jacket, shoes etc). I\u2019m trying to remind myself that I\u2019ll probably pick up stuff like extra shirts or shorts if I need them (which might actually be a fun activity) but what would you pack for this length of trip?\n\nI am thinking three dresses (because they are complete outfits, don\u2019t need to be washed as much, and pack small), a pair of jeans, three shirts, two over sweaters to wear with outfits, a light jacket, pj pants, 6 underwear and a pair of tights/athletic shirt in case I want to do something more active/want comfy travel clothes. A pair of sandals and a pair of converse. Travel towel. \n\n\nI plan to wear my hiking pants, shoes, and fleece to travel with because I am terrified of my bag getting lost in transit and not having hiking stuff.",

            "comment": "Personally I would not bring 3 dresses to Peru in July/August, which is the middle of their winter. The weather will probably be too cold in the highlands most of the time to wear dresses, and they're not super practical for Peru's activities like hiking or or visiting ruins. At most, maybe bring one winter-friendly wool dress or similar in case you want to go out to a nicer restaurant. But, for the most part, your fleece, hiking gear, and sweaters are probably the best bet. Instead of jeans, I'd recommend versatile hiking pants or fleece-lined athletic pants. If you're visiting the Amazon, pack long-sleeve cool clothing in light colours to protect you from the bugs and the sun.\n\nAnd you likely don't need so many shoes; your hiking shoes will take you most places, and you'll probably want a pair of flip-flops for hostel showers and whatnot. \n\nRemember you can buy plenty of alpaca wool items at the local markets in Peru if you're cold; nights especially can get chilly in the mountains.\n\nIdeally, try to keep your entire pack to a carry-on compliant size, which means you can take it on the plane with you and not worry about it getting lost in transit. If you have too much gear for a 40L carry-on bag, you probably are packing too much.",

Given that most temperatures look to be between 14-20 degrees outside of Cusco, I think dresses make more sense than sweaters. Good reminder than I can buy wool stuff though.",

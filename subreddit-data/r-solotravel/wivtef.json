    "postText": "I don't have the most amazing stories to tell from traveling. I haven't made new best friends all over the world, or learned 7 new languages, or found the off-the-beaten-path unknown wonders to see in every country.    \n    \nI stay in popular hostels, go on tours sometimes, and try new food when I'm feeling up for it (but get instant noodles from the store if I'm feeling homesick). I can only travel for a few weeks a year at most, and some years I can't afford to travel at all. Sometimes, I travel for a few days without meeting any new friends, and eat my meals alone. I'm writing this post from my hostel in Ecuador, where I've been on TikTok for the last few hours cause I'm tired and burnt out from socializing (and only one other person here speaks english and he's passed out drunk already).   \n    \nBut I still have fun, my travels are my own, and I get to see new places and cultures I would never otherwise explore. Sometimes I'm uncomfortable, but I know that's good for me. I've made a few good friends while traveling but I'm certainly not the life of the party. And that's okay.   \n     \nIt can be really easy to compare yourself to others, either online, in your friend group, or in the hostels you're staying at. If you're feeling down, or feeling like your trip isn't good enough, I wanted to let you know that you're doing great just for being here. You're trying something a lot of people are afraid to do, and not everyone travels the same way.           \n     \nA message from this mediocre but happy traveler - keep on keeping on, enjoy the good, ride out the bad, and get home safe!",

            "comment": "This is a great post. I think when I was younger, I wanted my trips to have \"meaning\" or be life-altering in some way. And they _were_ life-altering in that they made me change my view, they opened my mind and taught me self-toughness. But they were never \"off the beaten track\" (mostly because safety is paramount as a solo female traveller) nor was I the life and soul of the party. \n\nNow I travel for relaxation, curiousity and pleasure and I upload barely anything to SM. Makes me a much happier traveller.",

The track exists for a reason, for the most part it's where the nicest and most interesting places are. If you're a seasoned traveler whose seen everything already then by all means get out and explore random villages but for most people sticking to the well worn path will lead to a more fun and probably safer holiday",

I find most of the touristy places to be overcrowded, overrated, and find that most people only go there because it's on some list.\n\nThink about the Mona Lisa for example. It's a just a tiny painting that's kind of boring, yet people will stand in a mob to try and get a photo from 100ft away with their phone. I greatly preferred seeing the beautiful cathedral and tapestry in Bayeux which both had like 2 other people.\n\nI've had some of the best travel experiences in non-touristy countries like Ukraine and Moldova so that's why I stick to places like this.",

Larger than Bruges and it feels more like a 'real' city, as opposed to the very beautiful but not necessarily lived-in streets of Bruges. Ghent is still rich in beautiful historic architecture, and I heard they've invested a bunch in biking infrastructure which I as a biking advocate would be interested in checking out. 2 days should be plenty (maybe even on the longer side, depending on your travel style).",

I also spent 90% of this time completely alone, many days not even going out, and had a two month depressive episode where I was not functional.

If you can make a ton of buddies at every stop, then that's fantastic, but expecting the whole trip to be about finding people to spend your time with is a recipe for disappointment and depression unless all of your actions revolve around trying to meet new people.",

I travel solo usually (because my friends live far away, can't travel on the same dates or only go on trips with their husbands/families), but at 38, I choose hotels where I don't have to share a room or a bathroom with strangers. I join tours, walk on my own, read books, eat nice food, have some chats with people, go to bed early and get up early. I'm just happy to do things on my own terms and at my own pace, and so glad to have these experiences instead of staying home just because nobody wants to / can travel with me.\n\nThere's no \"right way\" to travel, there's the way that's right for you.",

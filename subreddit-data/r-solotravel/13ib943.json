(Taiwan) Travel Authorization Certificate for SEA Nationality yesterday and thought it would be a great idea to visit taiwan this december. While looking at the form, I noticed this section that said \"contact person and contact information\"\n\nDo I have to know someone in Taiwan? \n\nI'm traveling solo and doesn't know anyone taiwanese. Should I just apply for like travel agency?\n\nSide question:\n\nHow crowded taiwan during the new year? And how cold? I actually wants to escape Japan's winter lol",

    "postText": "Looking for advice on which countries/cities/ areas to visit in Latin America! My plan is to spend two months there. The aim of my trip is to become fluent in Spanish (currently b1 / b2 level), make friends and experience different ways of seeing the world.\n\nSafety is not my greatest concern because my country has similar crime issues, but i am a solo woman traveller. I'll be flying from New York as I'm visiting a friend there first. My primary concern is budget!  I would like to spend less than 2000$ including return flights from new york, and I plan on going from August- October. \n\nI love rock climbing and hiking! I want to see unique places and natural beauty, I'm not much of a party-goer but i love food!! . I am interested in archaeology / architecture / fossils/ruins. I am also considering doing a workaway of sorts! \n\nMy current thinking is Colombia and Peru. Or mexico and guatemala. or mexico and colombia?  I'm thinking max 2 / 3 places so i can experien more of one place, rather than see a little bit of many places (and to save travel time / costs). \n\nPlease share any thoughts / personal anecdotes !! Anything is welcome",

The tickets are probably going to be minimum $500 unless you luck out on a deal. 2 months is a lot more doable but even then you would be stretching it. Imo no point in going across the world for that long if you don't have the money to actually experience it. \n\nNot partying will save you money and so will a workaway but you will still need to be extremely frugal, aka never eat out, never do activities that cost more than like $5 per day.",

Europe is more expensive but imo there is a lot less tours and stuff you do and more just getting into museums etc. Whereas I feel like Mexico and Central america are a lot better doing snorkeling tours or caving tours/ hiking tours that are way more challenging to do transport wise alone than with a day tour so the cost adds up. examples are Acatenango, ATM cave tours, Inca/ Salkantay (have not been but an example I don't think you can even do this alone)",

The bonus about Ecuador, especially places like Cuenca, is the Spanish is so much easier to understand. That's why there are tons of Spanish schools in Quito etc. \n\nI keep going back to Colombia bc it's so vibrant and fun. Every big city there I felt great except Cali. My friends there wouldn't even let me walk the streets after dark. I saw a (non fatal but crazy still) shooting from my friend's balcony in strata 4 even.\n\nI've been to every Central Am country alone except to Guatamala. I got stabbed in Leon Nicaragua by a robber and it severed the nerves and muscles in my arm. Surgeries (not there), years of pt recovery but will never be the same but thankful I'm alive. Life is cheap there. The poverty was much worse than I imagined. People report great visits though. I feel like it could happen in half the places I've been though.\n\nThere are good, kind people everywhere that look out for you. Most were quite adamant about  my safety. The cops have never been helpful in any instance, ever, anywhere. Living there we actually avoided them (shakedowns etc.) \n\nThese are my experiences, not to offend anybody or stereotype. I am just passionate about travel and definitely Latin America. I love it. A bunch of people have said Colombia and I second that big time! I felt very comfortable being a female gringa alone aside from Cali.\n\nAgain, Ecuador: I worked there bc it's so beautiful in such little travel time. Amazing to be in the Amazon then a few days later in the highlands, both with different indigenous people learning their culture.\n\nRe. Spanish - if I stuck around the hostels/pensiones I almost never used my Spanish but I met a lot of people to join up with. Buen viaje:)!!",

I prioritise nutritious food over everything as that\u2019s what helps me stay healthy so my budget in the food department will be more than most people\u2019s. Each meal is probably around $6-7 unless we buy groceries. I stay in hostels or airbnbs if it\u2019s affordable because I\u2019m traveling with a girl I\u2019ve met. I won\u2019t spend more than $15. We\u2019ve been spending about $12 each per night on a single room with a double bed but the cheapest hostels are around $9 + taxes. Don\u2019t really do any crazy activities, just enjoy exploring, eating good food, swimming in lake Atitlan and hiking. So it\u2019s not crazy expensive for Americans or Europeans but I\u2019m from South Africa so I definitely feel the exchange rate, especially in the more touristy areas like Lake Atitlan and Antigua. I\u2019m only hear for 12 days unfortunately and I think I will have spent around $550 by the end of my journey here, including the $98 overnight volcano hike",

If you don't have a bit more to spend I'd suggest you think about traveling to neighboring countries so you can take the bus across borders to save money opposed to flying. Trust me, the bus isn't as bad as people make it out to be.  Based on that I'd recommend....\n\n- Mexico (Chiapas) &gt; Guatemala (Antigua &amp; Lake Atitlan - which can be expensive &amp; Quetzaltenango) \n\n- Ecuador (Quito, Cuenca) &gt; Per\u00fa (Lima, Arequipa, Cusco - just be mindful that the Spanish in Peru in interesting and take your time acclimating to the altitude)\n\nI suppose you can also do Colombia &gt; Ecuador but I think Ecuador to Peru would be more in line with your budget and what you like to do.",

            "comment": "If budget is a concern, Central America is generally cheaper than South America, except Peru is quite cheap. Chile and Argentina are quite expensive. I\u2019ve been the whole of central and South America except a bit of Peru, Bolivia Ecuador. Going to two or three neighboring countries would be better cost wise as well. \n\nMexico-Guatemala\n\nColombia-Ecuador or Colombia-Peru\n\nWould not do Mexico-Colombia as it would\nCost more though I guess you can check flights yourself. Colombia does have frequent flights to NYC.\n\nI\u2019m also a rock climber and if your goal is to learn Spanish as well, it would be worth basing your trip around a Spanish school. Xela (Quetzaltenango) in Guatemala is often a good cheap base for learning Spanish and there is decent climbing and hiking there, though you would want to know some Spanish to climb there as the locals don\u2019t speak much English. However Xela is in the mountains so it may be cold depending on the time of year. You can climb more in Mexico before/after in San Crist\u00f3bol de las casas, potrero chico and areas near Mexico City. There are also Spanish schools in Antigua, but it is more of an old colonial town, really beautiful but aside from the volcano hike nearby (which I\u2019m not sure if people still hike it since it erupted relatively recently), not sure there is much to do there. \n\nColombia is also an option and there are good Spanish schools and good climbing (not at the same places) in La Mojarra and Suesca. The flights from NYC can be reasonable to Cartagena, but generally I\u2019d consider it more expensive than Central America), also being quite a large, mountainous country it\u2019s usually easier to take a cheap regional flight than to take a mega long bus ride between cities, so not sure if it would work easily budget wise. though if you have time, you can certainly take buses. \n\nI think Mexico and Guatemala are both quite accessible for foreign solo travelers. Colombias tourism caters more towards the local middle class, though the infrastructure there is fine. Peru is very cheap.",

I\u2019ve met so many people who planned to go to other countries but ended up just staying the whole time in Colombia because there\u2019s so much to do and something for everyone. I wouldn\u2019t cut out colombia if I were you and I believe it\u2019s one of the cheapest Latin American countries to travel. Also if you like rock climbing I am about to go to Refugio La Roca, a climbing hostel in Colombia which I\u2019ve heard great things about. I\u2019ve also heard so many other great things about the other countries you plan to go to though. Guatemala is good for hiking with all the volcanos, Mexico has great food and outdoors, and Peru has the multiple treks to Maccu Pichu. So don\u2019t stress too much because I\u2019m sure regardless you\u2019ll have a great time!!!",

Alhambra is very cool and there is tasty well priced food.\n\nEdit: to more specifically address your question, I would cut two days off Madrid, two off Porto and take that time to go to Granada. I would also consider cutting a day off Barna. But it\u2019s the coolest of those three cities. You could even stop in Malaga on the way to Granada from Seville. In Seville I would take a day to go visit Rocio and Do\u00f1ana. These big cities are pretty awesome but you would save yourself some money and avoid the most crowded of tourist areas if you spent more time in Andaluc\u00eda and ventured outside of major cities in general.",

Thank you so much for sharing!\n\nI am afraid of travelers fatigue by constantly moving. The mindset was more to stay in places longer and enjoy the city and relax while still seeing sites and hiking. But I think I have to include a couple more places.

From Madrid you can also take a day trip to Toledo and/or Segovia. And while in Sevilla, make sure to visit Granada as well. Also consider that you basically \u201close\u201d a day moving from one place to another depending on the distance, so plan the days in each city accordingly.\n\nEdit to add: Since you like hiking you should consider going to Malaga and do Caminito Del Rey before or after Seville.",

    "postText": "A lot of the posts I've seen about traveling with anxiety are just like \"Wow it changed my life!  I don't have anxiety anymore!\" and that was not my experience at all, so I wanted to make a post about that.\n\n1. The first couple days are the hardest.  Especially if you're in a big city.  Walking around will help you get a feel of the geography, but it won't help you acclimate to the culture.  You need other things for that.\n2. Having specific plans helps ease anxiety.  I found that my worst days were the ones where I didn't have plans, and on those days I found it hard to leave my room.\n3. If you're feeling really anxious about exploring, don't be ashamed to do really touristy stuff for a day or so if your budget allows. Book a bus tour or walking tour or something.  There's no shame in it, and something about it just feels safe.\n4. Stay in a hostel.  The first night or so is hard but I know with my anxiety if I had a room to myself I probably would have talked to nobody outside of food service and stuff.  In a hostel, you're in close quarters with others and it's hard not to talk to/make friends with them.  If you're lucky they may even invite you to dinner.\n5. Eating alone feels really really weird.  It took me a few days to be able to go anywhere other than cheap takeout places, but it's the kind of thing you just have to work to get over.  I started with a really casual pub to eat alone for the first time and worked my way into nicer places (not that I had the budget to eat anything super expensive).\n6. It's really nice when people ask where you're from.  I found talking about home made me feel at ease.  Obviously reciprocate and ask where they're from.\n7. If you find cities dense and uncomfortable, look for excursions outside of the city you're staying in.  Maybe even try to find a place to stay for a night in a smaller town if you think that'll help you take a breath.\n8. Don't feel bad about going to bed early if you're not into nightlife.  You shouldn't feel like you're missing out if you're missing out on something you aren't interested in.  And being well-rested definitely helps prepare you for whatever you have planned.\n9. If you're in an area where you can make international calls/your budget allows, talking to friends, family, etc. feels so comforting.  I had an emergency happen my second day of travel (turned out my credit card info had gotten stolen the day before I left for my trip) and calling my mom and talking through it was a lot better than trying to deal with it alone.\n10. No matter how anxious you're feeling, don't be excited to go home.  You'll regret it a lot if you're counting down the days.  No matter how you feel, you're still in a new place, experiencing new things, and you'll kick yourself later if you spent the whole time being ready to leave.\n\nI hope this post helped somebody.  Or maybe the whole thing is just a big \"duh\" for experienced travelers.  Ultimately, anxiety is different for everyone; you've gotta find your own ways to ground yourself.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nEDIT: I'm really glad to see how many people found my advice useful.  Thank you.  I just wanted to add some more visibility to some issues people brought up in the comments:\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable staying in a hostel, please *please* don't force yourself to.  I was a college student not too long ago, and I had shared housing for most of my college career, so I was decently prepared, but this may not be the case for you!\n\nYour goal should always be to get out of your comfort zone.  That said, control the things you can control and embrace the things you can't.  Traveling opens you up to new experiences so don't avoid new experiences.\n\nTravel is not a replacement for seeing a mental health professional!!  I regularly see a therapist back home, but that also doesn't mean I don't still have anxiety, and it especially doesn't mean that travel didn't exacerbate my existing symptoms.  Don't expect travel to cure you, but do expect it to broaden your worldview and give you an enhanced perspective.\n\nThanks again for all the love.",

It required renting a car which was surprisingly inexpensive for two weeks.\n\nIt was really nice to get off the beaten path and enjoy the beautiful French countryside. Also- no FOMO going to bed early because there was little to no nightlife in most spots. A lot of evenings involved a bubble bath and local bottle of wine. And even better, everything is cheaper in smaller towns and you get a unique experience. 10/10.",

I was there in March which is still off season, so the room was cheaper but it was warm enough to enjoy the nice walking trails nearby. \n\nThe little hotel in town was amazing. The owner was very nice, and they brought fresh squeezed orange juice and pastries to the room every morning. Overall an amazing experience.",

I went to Ireland and the absence of a language barrier alone helped.  Beyond that, the culture isn't so different, so my trip became a lot more about exploring the landscape (which was also great because it got me out of Dublin, which is a super average city tbh--sorry to any Dubliners reading this).  The biggest trick I think with going to a familiar place is to decide what exactly you're hoping to get out of it.  If you're looking to awaken to another culture, a place that's similar to where you've been maybe isn't a great call, but I personally was more in it for the nature and old buildings so the culture being familiar was a plus.",

It's a shitty little Philly suburb with maybe like 3 shops.  The closest thing to \"\"\"\"tourism\"\"\"\" we get is people coming in from out of town for the farmer's markets we sometimes do.  But if you're in the middle of most major cities (especially outside of the US) I feel like there's definitely an expectation that tourists are gonna be there and they're gonna spend money so even when people around here pegged me as a tourist they were always kind.  It's definitely mutually beneficial for local business owners to show you some kindness and meet you halfway.",

Not sure how experienced a hiker you are, but I booked a little group tour with this company called MountainTrails that was decently affordable and the guide seemed super experienced.\n\nBetween the Cliffs and Giant's Causeway, I'd say go for the Cliffs.

Then they weren\u2019t. People were moving away starting the next phase of their life. I began to get anxious about going out and seeing people. Doing things outside. My 4 walls were my solace. My safety net. \nI was too anxious to move from one end of the country to the other. Too anxious to move jobs. \nJust anxious. \nI met a woman a few years back while on holiday. She was from the other side of the planet. So how could it even work?\nWell, I managed to move to the other side of the planet, the anxiety I felt for the few months before I left was the worse I have ever felt. So much was riding on me moving. \nBut after doing this, something I had never done before, I feel like I have taken a huge step to dealing with anxiety. I feel like I could literally move anywhere on the planet now. No dramas. \nAnxiety is tough and can fuck you up in any way you can think of, I found that challenging it internally was a way to beat it (for a period of time, or perhaps just beating the fear of moving places). \nI still get anxiety, but I have found ways of soothing myself. Preparing myself. I read that anxiety is the worry of the future. Something that is in my hands. If I properly prepare to do something big, it\u2019s much easier on my nerves. \nI applaud you for solo travelling. It\u2019s something I never wanted or thought I could do.

Thanks for your post, I'm glad you gained a lot of insight! \n\nThat's interesting to me that you prefer to stay in a dorm instead of a private room. I *ALWAYS* stay in a private room because something that can trigger panic for me is to not have a place to be alone if I need to. I don't really have any issue meeting people in other ways though.

I hate it when some people give travelers a hard time about going that route, regardless of whether or not anxiety has anything to do with it. I've booked tours like that simply because I was lazy and didn't feel like planning anything myself and it was just easier to do. Nothing wrong with that! \n\nI hope you continue traveling!",

People seem really grouped up and busy getting ready or just relaxing, but once I'm in the pub I not only feel more social myself but I feel like those around me do as well.\n\nBut that's just me.

Planning everything out to combat the feeling of uncertainty and the anxiety it brings doesn't help you get better at tolerating uncertainty. It band aids the symptom and perpetuates anxious habits. For me, living in the moment, not having a plan and living each day as it came on the road actually helped me live in the present, adapt to problems easier and stop stressing the small things in life. My advice to people with anxiety would be to allow themselves to have days on the road where they dont have a strict plan or be willing to say yes to random offers to join activities with other travellers. Be spontaneous and enjoy it. \n\nThat said, I do understand that this isn't a post about using travel to heal anxiety. It's about coping with it and your advice does address that. But travel presents such a unique opportunity to challenge this particular symptom of anxiety that I feel this should be said.",

It really depends on the person and each case is unique.\n\nYou *can* travel while struggling with anxiety at the same time. It doesn't mean that everyone who does this is \"running away\". Shocking, I know: many people with anxiety want to see the world just like everyone else. And if everyone with anxiety issues were forced to wait until they're completely \"fixed\" to start travelling, then a lot of them would be waiting their whole lives. Anxiety sucks but it doesn't have to be crippling; it can be managed.\n\nIt's not up to you, a stranger on the internet, to decide whether solo travel is right for OP, or for anyone else suffering from anxiety or depression. It's a decision that they need to make for themselves. OP made the decision to travel, and it sounds like they did a great job recognising their triggers and managing their anxiety in a healthy way.",

They're allowed to want to travel, just like normal humans! Just because they're travelling doesn't mean they're trying to \"cure\" themselves, and I'm personally super confused as to where you got that idea considering OP never said that and it seems to be something you made up.",

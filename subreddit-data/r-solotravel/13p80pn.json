I am wondering if there are other sites that are similar. \n\nOr if there are downsides to booking with a group that does include the flight and if it would be better to book your own.",

I don\u2019t want to spend an extra $2000 to buy a flight on top of it? \nI\u2019m assuming with the flight included you probably couldn\u2019t choose your seat? Or have to pay for bags that might normally be included with my own flight.",

For example, if its a tour throughout Europe that's 2-3 weeks, being able to book your own flight means that you can come before the tour starts or travel after it ends which can give you some flexibility in your travels.",

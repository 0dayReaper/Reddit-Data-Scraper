I have done extensive solo traveling before but I was getting tired of staying in hostels and wandering around touristy cities, so I decided to go hiking. This was my first time doing a multi-day hike.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing beats packing up your bags every morning and making a journey across a vast, magical landscape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am still in Iceland (if you're here too, hit me up!). This trail is probably the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.",

            "comment": "Tolkien was massively influenced by Iceland's environment, and the stories of its people. \n\nHis exposure to its environment were chiefly through the works of English designer William Morris, who documented his Victorian travels through Iceland thoroughly. The influence is unmistakable. [Look at some of maps to see what I mean](http://morrisedition.lib.uiowa.edu/Images/EreDwellersCountryMap.jpg)!\n\nHis exposure to its stories were primarily through its sagas. As a [student and professor of language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf:_A_Translation_and_Commentary), delving back into Old English naturally would have attracted him to Icelandic, a living language that shares much with the roots of his own language. A significant chunk of the inspiration for Tolkien's legendarium is found in Icelandic sagas such as the [V\u00f6lsunga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lsunga_saga). Frodo is [literally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%B3%C3%B0i) the name of various Danish kings, and is still used as a name in Iceland!\n\nThanks for sharing this lovely photo.\n\nAlso of note: the Great Eagles of Manw\u00eb, though not mentioned as such by Tolkien himself, would have been the dinosaurs that had not gone extinct, *just like in the real world*. Exciting! ",

This is a good one:\nhttps://www.femalehiker.com/hikes/laugavegur\n\nIt\u2019s an easy trail, well marked, and there is no wilderness to get lost into.\n\nFew tips:\n\n1. Do North to South. I don\u2019t get why people recommend going against the tide and doing it South to North; you\u2019d just keep running into everyone doing the N to S route. On the N to S route people would be behind you or ahead of you.\n\n2. Don\u2019t camp. Weather is harsh and you don\u2019t get to meet people. The social atmosphere of the huts was half of what made the hike so amazing.\n\n3. I left at 9 and would usually reach the next hut by 2:15. Gives me plenty of time and privacy throughout.\n\n4. Do not book a tour. I don\u2019t get why someone would pick such a beautiful and easy hike and then pay a company so much money to walk like turtles in groups of 20 and have someone else cook their food, do their dishes, and carry their bags.",

I've always been a huge nerd and my absolute most favorite video game zone (probably partially due to nostalgia tbh) was Grizzly Hills in World of Warcraft. As a kid, I always dreamed of visiting the \"real life\" Grizzly Hills. I live in flat-ass Wisconsin and my family never traveled.\n\nThis summer I went out to work in Glacier National Park for a few months (first time seeing mountains!), and one day near the end of the season, I was driving the Going-to-the-Sun road and it just hit me like a truck. I finally made it to Grizzly Hills, I literally cried in my car like a baby. It was wonderful.",

By talking to them for a hour and a half I got to know they hiked from Akureyri all the way down to Skogar, that\u2019s around 280 miles, in 17 days. I was freakishly surprised by there enthu even after spending 17 days out of Civilization. I have been on hikes at some of the destinations in United States, but the next time I am in Iceland it would be for the 280 miles hike. ",

I just bring the 30% stuff, which I find works fine. \n\nRemember that with DEET, you only want to spray your skin, NOT your clothes. It doesn't work on fabrics and the high percentage DEET will eat through plastics and synthetics. It also works via evaporation, which means it should always be the top layer on your skin. i.e. sunscreen first, bugspray second.\n\nIf you are extra concerned about bugs, you can soak your clothes in Permethrin before you travel, though this is probably overkill unless you're planning to spend a lot of time deep in the jungle.",

Never felt the need for it in Southeast Asia, TBH. But then I've mostly gone on trips where I've stayed in hostels or hotels.",

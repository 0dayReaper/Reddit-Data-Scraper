    "postText": " \n\nHey guys!\n\nI am biking 2000 KM across Japan alone for the next few months and I'm going to be writing updates about my journey. I spent several days working my way from the city of Kagoshima through the mountains to a small town on the coast called Izumi.\n\nHere are the [photos ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/mobile/folders/1ejYEChksXBAobS3NJq8FkgLQKfiSvP95?usp=share_link&amp;pli=1)if anyone wants to see!\n\nI had a very interesting experience on my first day of biking across Japan. I was biking through the mountains of Kagoshima, the southernmost province of Japan. When I got to my hotel I found out it was abandoned. I was afraid since I do not speak Japanese and I could not find a new hotel nearby. It was getting very dark out and I kept biking through the mountains. I was very tired since I had biked uphill for 9 hours, and my body started to feel heavy. I met a man cooking chicken skewers in a small village and I asked him if I could camp on his property. He agreed and I ordered some hot chicken from him. As we talked through google translate I told him about my journey across Japan and He invited me to stay with him in his home! We drank green tea deep into the night and he told me about his life and he showed me his Kanata. I'm so grateful that he opened his heart and his home!\n\nThe next morning I tried to bike the rest of Kagoshima's mountains, but I was only able to bike 30 kilometers in 11 hours. The mountains made it very hard, I had to get off my bike and push uphill for most of the trip. I have about 100 pounds of cargo with me. I had planned to stay at a camping ground, but it was getting dark and my stop was still far away. I found a patch of grass in a small town to set up my tent for the night. I went to the grocery store to buy some dinner and water. I asked the owner if I would get in trouble for sleeping in my tent in that spot without a permit. When she learned of my plan, she said that I could sleep in her grandmother's empty home! I was taken aback. I'm a complete stranger and they let me stay in their home. I was about to cry at her kindness. The Japanese people are the kindest people I have ever met. I was able to get a good night's rest before attempting to escape the mountain in the morning.\n\nThis became the most stressful day of my life. I continued my journey across the mountains of Kagoshima. I used Google Maps to find a route to the town of Izumi. The route took me deep into the mountains. As I got far in I realized that the route was abandoned. Trees cover the path and I had to throw my equipment over time and time again. I kept going through as the map said I would find a road soon. I soon started to lose signal and my water started to run low. As I continued I reached the road and learned it was abandoned. I was afraid I would get lost if I turned back so I kept pushing forward. The road was covered in trees and rocks, many parts are covered in landslides. Sunset quickly approached and I didn't want to travel this dangerous road in the dark so I set up my tent and slept. I eventually reached a part of the road that had collapsed. I started to climb around very slowly, the ground kept breaking away under my feet. It was very scary as the smallest misstep would mean I would fall and get injured. There would be no one to help me. I wouldn't even be able to call for help since my phone didn't have a signal in such a remote area. I spent several hours climbing and taking my belongings back and forth. I had to be very careful. I eventually made it across. I received many injuries from the rough forest and the broken road. I fell many times. I eventually was able to make it out in the morning.\n\nI was completely out of water and I had many injuries from the experience. I continued to push forward and found a highway where I continued to bike to Izumi. Within a few minutes of riding, I found a rest area with a water fountain! I was very relieved. As I refilled my bottle a paramedic stopped there to use the restroom. I stopped him and asked if he had a first aid kit. He noticed my injuries and started to clean them with alcohol. He used his bandages to help wrap the wounds. I was very grateful. I tried to give him money many times but he refused to accept. I continued my ride to the town of Izumi. I was very happy that the route was mainly downhill. I was very tired and it was to travel. I found the town of Izumi where I was able to get some more medical attention and food. It was the first time I was able to eat in 32 hours. I found a hotel where I was able to take a hot bath and eat some yummy ramen! Once again I am humbled by the kindness of Japan. My apologies for the delay in posting this update and spelling mistakes, I am still exhausted.  \n\n\nI turned this experience into a video, but I'm not allowed to post it here sadly. If you're interested in seeing it feel free to DM me. \n\nTLDR:\n\nI biked across the mountains of southern Japan, local families opened their homes to me on two different occasions and google maps almost killed me.",

It\u2019s one thing to go into solo travel without plans if you\u2019re going to rely on public transit and hostels, etc but if you are leaving yourself to the mercy of the elements you need to have a plan. In past history people died traversing mountains and rough terrain all the time. You should be aware of wildlife, know what wild plants could be available to forage in case you get lost, and have a filtration system for water so you can find natural water sources if you run out. I mean this with deep respect as it takes a lot of bravery and courage to do what you\u2019re doing and I\u2019m certain you\u2019ll have an incredible time, but we want you to live to tell the story. You got very lucky this time and were blessed with the kindness of strangers but please, please do some deeper research and planning for the remainder of your journey. And have the time of your life\ud83d\udc9b\n\nEdit: It reminds me a little of Into the Wild. Loved his backstory and motives, but man did it piss me off that he was so underprepared. I know you\u2019re not in the Alaskan wilderness, but being in the middle of mountains anywhere can be super dangerous. Being prepared can literally be a matter of life or death.",

Add to this the chance of random injuries and there's no way in hell I'd attempt what OP did in a totally abandoned area. I've turned back from relatively well-traveled paths there when I saw warning signs about snakes lol.\n\nWith all that said, mad respect for doing this and I'd love to see more updates.

Anti-venom would be a very smart thing to be carrying (OP, are you carrying anti-venom?), along with knowing with relative accuracy the nearest towns, villages, etc in case medical care is needed. And that\u2019s just snakes, not even the rest. Bear spray? A well-stocked first aid kit? I mean 100lbs is an insane amount of weight so maybe you\u2019ve got that stuff in there, hopefully you do. Just remember there\u2019s a fine line between adventure and stupidity and do your damnedest to stay on the side of the former.\ud83d\udc9b",

A friend described me best when they said \"minimum planning leads to maximum adventure.\" What that meant to me is that I'd often start the day not knowing where I'd be sleeping that very night. If a neighboring camper invited me over for a morning cup of tea because they were curious about the bike with all my stuff on it, we might really hit it off and get lost in conversation to the point that I don't even get on the bike until noon. \"Minimum planning, maximum adventure,\" to me, means not turning down opportunities like that to connect with people because I'd rather put in a few more miles on the bike.\n\nWhat that mantra did not mean, though, is going 32 hours without food, especially while burning as much as 4,000 calories a day. Of course shit happens. I've had days where Google maps put me on roads I'd've rather avoided, just like you. But I carry a water filter and first aid kit with me for exactly those kinds of situations, two items that you could've benefited from greatly.\n\nI saw that you replied to similar concerns describing your plans to stay closer to civilization for the next few days, and you're certainly wise to do that. But it cannot be overstated how strongly I would recommend you seriously reflect on what happened these past few days, and what you could do differently next time to keep yourself safer. And if you aren't already familiar, you should check out /r/bicycletouring. It is the best resource I've ever found for doing stuff like what you're trying, and without the advice and inspiration I found in that community, I never would've done my own trip.\n\nSafe travels! I've never been to Japan, but if you have any questions about bike touring in general, don't hesitate to reach out. Once you run out of ways to do it wrong, it's an amazing way to see the world, but you definitely need to be careful.",

I could have gotten this cheaper, but I didn't want to risk mechanical issues if I was in the mountains alone. I would advise against renting since you would have to bring this back to the starting point and you would be liable if anything happened to the bike. All of this depends on how far you are going and your goals. So there isn't one answer.  \n\n\nIf you want to bring your own bike call the airline and they can reserve space for you but It usually costs $90 and you need to make sure the bike is disassembled and packaged. You can ask a bike store to do this for you and it costs about $60 depending on the place you go to.   \n\n\nLmk if you have more questions :)",

I'm using it since I can sit upright, a road bike would destroy my back after 8 hours.   \n\n\nBut for why am I biking across the country: \n\n1: I have struggled with my weight since I was a kid and I think changing my environment and biking 50km a day will help me break free\r  \n\r  \n2: I have always wanted to experience Japan in its entirety. Biking across Japan will force me to see the whole country and see what life here is really like.\r  \n\r  \n3: I wanted to force myself to become a better storyteller so I'm going to turn this adventure into a video series. The limited time to edit is going to force me to focus and get better at content creation.",

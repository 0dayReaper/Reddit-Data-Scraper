    "postText": "Hi solo travelers,\n\nAnyone has experiences with overland travel (bus) from Istanbul to Batumi, Georgia? At the end of summer I (F56, solo traveler) will be traveling overland from Amsterdam to Batumi, and till Istanbul it seems more or less clear from what I researched on Rome2Rio. And from Istanbul to Batumi there seems to be a bus with a 20 hour ride. How and where to find tickets? What about the safety on board? Can I get out at the Turkish Black Sea coast and continue a few days later (and where is the best place for that)? Any other experiences or information about overland travel to Georgia is much appreciated too! Thanks a lot!",

I used Metro bus company (https://www.metroturizm.com.tr/en/), the bus was fine for us, not super fancy, but clean and comfortable enough. Trip was safe and uneventful, in a good sense, so you should be fine. Still, I recommend to try a shorter trips first - there are a few cities on the Black Sea coast which I think worth at least a short visit (1-2 days). The bus goes through most of them in any case, so you can do a part of the route on day one, then stay in one of this cities, and continue your trip on the next day. If you have enough time I definitely recommend that. Turkish - Georgian border - the only issue, that can be a little crowded, a lot of locals there going in both directions. Aside from that you should be fine. That's pretty much it. \nWish you luck with your trip)",

But at least I think Samsun is important part of the modern Turkish republic history and Trabzon also have some interesting sites from various epochs. We had plans to visit these but maybe actually you can find some guide in Istanbul who can give recommendations according to your interests. That shouldn't be hard cause most of the hotels in Istanbul have some connections to guides. \nAnd also, the last bit - from Trabzon it's about 2-3 hours ride to the Georgian border. And from border it's about 20-30 minutes to Batumi itself. I skip recommendations for Batumi itself cause you'll find a lot of generous people in the city itself who can provide much better recommendations than I \ud83d\ude42",

Sleeper cabins are available but expensive eversince the instagram influencers discovered this scenic route. Normal seats are cheap as chips though. Either way an amazing experience and from Kars it\u2019s not far to the border near Batumi.",

Don\u2019t know how expensive the sleeper cabins were but the couchette was like $30, and while it was full in Ankara I was the only person for the majority of the trip because the other passengers got off earlier. No way I\u2019d do it in normal seats though",

I took the bus with a company called Metro (turkish bus company) from batumi to Istanbul. If I remember correctly, is wasam around 30 eu and 22 hours. Very comfortable and safe bus experience! I bought my ticket in Tbilisi at a metro office so you could do the same at a metro office in Istanbul I suppose or anywhere else when you get close to Turkey where there might be metro offices (probably somewhere in Romania or Bulgaria).",

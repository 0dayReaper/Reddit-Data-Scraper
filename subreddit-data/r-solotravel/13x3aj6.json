    "postText": "I\u2019m a solo traveler that takes short trips for the most part. I prefer them but also I can\u2019t always have more 2 consecutive weeks off. \n\n&lt;2 weeks is my norm and it\u2019s usually only longer if I am going across the world. I am at a point in my life where I will mostly be able to take weekend trips or 1 week trips. Do you think it\u2019s worth it to take trips to far out destinations for 2 weeks or less or do you tend to stick to closer places? I am based in the U.S. and sometimes ticket prices and hotel prices seem to expensive to be worth a weekend trip as a solo traveler. I imagine this is much easier in Europe! \n\nAny stories to share about amazing short trips you have? I feel like we see lots of long term amazing trop travel stories or reports but I would love to hear about the amazing short weekend, weeklong, or 2 week trips you have had!",

This sub makes it seem differently because it skews young, but the vast majority of people are not able to take off multiple weeks or months at a time to travel. My job would never approve more than 2 weeks off and I only get two weeks of vacation time per year anyway. I block my schedule so that I work at the beginning of a week and the end of the next so I can have 8 days off without PTO. It makes for a rushed vacation and sometimes I'm tired but I've never regretted it.",

Ie. Do Japan, Taiwan and Thailand in one long trip rather than 3 shorter ones from the US. Maybe more if you give up your housing at home\n\nIt also depends on how easily you recover from the effects of jet leg. I know people who will do an around the world trip in a week, and others who wouldn\u2019t even consider going to Asia for less than three weeks.\n\nUltimately time is more precious than money. Make the best out of the time you have available.",

I will say that I plan far in advance, tend to stay in one location, do my best not to travel at peak season, and try to keep my travel time under 24 hours total (if I'm going away for longer that doesn't apply but for a short trip, it's gotta be as easy and direct as possible). I've done a few 4 or 5 day trips in Europe for fun/family stuff and last year I did a 6 night stay in Fiji (super easy from CA). I'm doing 5 nights in Madrid this summer for a wedding. I've also done a few like progressive trips: 3 nights in nyc followed by 3 nights in Iceland and ending with 3 nights in London.

I just browse for the cheapest flight deals and typically let that decide where I go.\n\nFor example:\nI\u2019ve done a Saturday 5am flight from NYC to Chicago and flew back Sunday at 8pm. This is extremely fast paced and not what some people can handle, but damn do I love making use of my spare time. I got to see so much and enjoyed every minute. \n\nI\u2019ve also done 2 night trips to New Orleans, Nashville, and Seattle, and Denver. I actually just went to Denver a few weeks ago for my birthday, I even got to experience Rocky Mountain National Park!\n\nThese short weekend trips I look at spending a max of $350-400 on flights if it\u2019s a location I\u2019m dying to go. Typically I will travel on flights between 200-300. I believe my Chicago trip was $180.",

With Asia, its 20+ hour journeys MINIMUM! \n\nI think central america and south america might be a move for the foreseeable future, except for the places in south america that also tend to have long flights",

            "comment": "So I'm going to be totally different from most people here in that anything over a week in length is my LONG trip. Most of my trips are short because I just don't have enough time off but I absolutely love to travel so 3-4 days trips are the only way to make it work. I usually don't travel within the US for the reasons you mentioned unless its to visit friends or for a specific event. Almost all of those trips are over a weekend with maybe a day off Friday/Monday at the maximum.\n\nI just got back from a 4 day trip to Chil\u00e9, I absolutely loved it! I only had enough time to see a little bit but I'd absolutely do it again for 4 days as opposed to not going at all. Sure I would have loved to see more of the incredible beauty and experiences that the country had to offer but I make it work with the time I have.\n\nMy first solo trip was 4 days to the Azores. I've similarly done a 3 day trip to Buenos Aires, Granda (Nicaragua), Antigua (Guatemala), Sint Maarten and a few weekends in El Salvador. Had a phenomenal experience in all these places. Done a few 3-4 day trips to Amsterdam as well but I have quite a few friends in the Netherlands so those are more to catch up with them as opposed to solo travel.\n\nIt all depends on your personal situation, if I had more time available I would absolutely do longer trips but just because my trips are short doesn't mean they aren't super fun!",

Obviously I couldn't do everything I wanted in that short amount of time, but it was still incredible, and now I know more of what I want to see and focus on the next time I go back. \n\nI have an upcoming trip to Amsterdam for 8 days and I'm wondering what I'm going to do with all that time, haha... maybe hop on a train to Belgium for a weekend? I guess I'm just used to shorter trips and 2 weeks would be so much time for me (I'd take it though!).",

One of the keys is to focus on an area rather than trying to \"do Europe\" in a week.\n\nLast spring I went to Spain.  I spent most of the time in Barcelona (because their tourism website had so many interesting things to see and do) and then a couple of days in Madrid.\n\nTwo years ago I found an insanely cheap flight to Reykjavik and spent just over a week there, half of which was in the north (Akureyri as a base) and the other part on Borgarnes and Reykjavik.\n\nI'm currently looking at visiting Estonia, either splitting time between Tallinn and Helsinki, or just staying within the country and exploring more areas of it.\n\nPrices will depend on when you go.  Summer will be high (and crowded and for some places very hot).",

            "comment": "It totally is worthwhile! I also usually have to make do with no more than two weeks off work at most, and all my holidays, near or far, have worked with that maximum. I've made my peace with not being able to take a longer period off work and go exploring like my favourite travel writers. The focus is now not the length of the trip but what I can do with the time I do get. I don't want to get old and realise that I don't have the physical ability or mental interest to visit the places I want to do currently, and if that means multiple trips to the same country, then so be it. \n\nI just got back from South Africa (solo) yesterday. From my home in Delhi, it involved 15+ hours of flying with a transit through the Middle East. It was a 10 nights long tripped where I visited Johannesburg (briefly), safari-ed in Kruger, had a lot of good wine in Franschhoek, and spent the tail end discover beautiful Cape Town. I LOVED the place and even left a trip review post on this sub a bit ago, and absolutely would have regretted not visiting it had I been too hung up about the amount of leaves I got off work. Ofcourse a longer trip would've been fun, but I can always return (and I definitely will, Cape Town and Franschhoek deserve more visits). \n\nEarlier last year, I visited JUST Luang Prabang in Laos thanks to a free trip deal that I was to encash on. It took around 10 hours and two transits to get there, and I was only around for 4 nights, but it was still worth it all! The place was beautiful, and the free trip deal only sweetened it all. I saw lots of beautiful temples, celebrated the local festival of lights, sailed on the Mekong, visited caves, bathed in waterfalls, and also fed elephants. \n\nBack in 2019, it took me 8+ hours of flying (with a transit at Singapore) to get to Indonesia, where I spent two weeks travelling from Jakarta to Yogyakarta (for Borobudur and Prambanan) to Surabaya (for Bromo) to Labuan Bajo (for Komodo) to Bali, and loved it all. Again, I'd have loved to spend months travelling across all of Indonesia's major islands, but I was very happy with whatever I could manage. \n\nMy other leisure trips have usually been closer-by, but I've done Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Laos, Uzbekistan, and Sri Lanka from Delhi in under two weeks each (Singapore being a long weekend infact); much of Europe over long weekends while studying/working in London and Paris; and extended leisure patches to work trips to Tanzania, Mauritius, and Nepal.",

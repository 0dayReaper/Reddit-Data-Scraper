    "postText": "Hey! I hope do do some traveling in November. i would finish a volunteer period on the 5th of November and start traveling Ecuador for around 12-14 days (Galapagos included). I would love to rent a car and drive myself so i can take my own pace and see some beautiful scenes (i did this in namibia with a friend and it was amazing).  \n\n\nMy travel plans are (not set):\n\nEcuador\n\nQuinto (1 night)\n\nSanta cruz &amp; Galapagos (3nights)\n\nQuinto -&gt; Mindo (2 nights)\n\nInsilnivi + quilotoa lake (2nights)\n\nCotopaxi (1 night)\n\nQuenca + cajas national park (2 nights)\n\nUndetermened stop on the way to quinto -&gt; quinto airport\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCosta rica:\n\nSan jose (1 night)\n\nLa Fortuna (2 nights)\n\nMonteverde national park, santa elena (2 nights)\n\nPark national Manuel antinio, quepos (2 nights)\n\nRicon de ja viera, Liberia (2 nights)\n\nVulcan tenorio (2 nights)\n\nLa Paz, vara blanca (1 night)\n\nSan jose airport\n\n  \nMy funds are in between 2000 and 4000 EURO\n\nI have all the time in the world. My main questions are how easy is it to drive around in Ecuador and Costa rica. How safe is it to travel alone there. are there any things i might be missing (functional things not really hidden spots). i read the roads in costa rica are bad but i have no idea how bad, i would rent a 4x4 since thats what every book and site is recommending.\n\nFor Ecuador i know a lot of books are recommending the public transport but i really like the freedom a car gives you. is public transport that good in Ecuador?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to tell me anything you think i need to know. i pretty used to traveling alone all though i must admit this is the first time im moving around this much. \n\nThanks in advance, Punkypluis",

He was spending a month traveling the country and the car rental was 2k USD. I hear Costa Rica car companies highly advise you buy their insurance despite having private insurance, because of the roads, like you mention. A hack around this is some credit cards might have a benefit in helping to cover the insurance part, but you\u2019ll have to research that. I\u2019d also check the Costa Rica subreddit. I used private car companies from SJ to Monteverde, La Fortuna then to Manuel Antonio. It was about $100 a ride. GL.",

Buying the added rental insurance would be a must and at that point your paying so much, I would 100% go with just hiring drivers to get you between cities",

The potholes and unpaved roads felt like a never ending rollercoaster ride. OP def get their rental insurance but I\u2019d say this will be tricky on your budget. Feel free to DM.",

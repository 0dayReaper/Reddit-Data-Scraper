    "postText": "Howdy reddit- popping into solo travel forum for advice on how to break the news to a friend that I want to turn trip originally planned together into solo excursion?\n\nContext: she brought up the idea that we should go to Puerto Rico in 2021 after being inspired seeing a relative go there earlier in the year. I was initially very skeptical/ low interest in the locationn but once I started doing research as to what PR has to offer I was super over the moon excited. I took the lead in planning  and we were all set ready to go until I had tragedy in my family days before trip start  which sadly lead to me canceling. \n\n2023 I started seriously  probing for us to get the trip rescheduled as in 2022 we kept saying  \"oh we should go\" but now with world opened up figured it would be good season. In my head the heavy lift to plan was done, we just have to rerun prices and it should be relatively  stress free swipe credit card here trip. \n\nWe agree to do 2 trips- reschedule of Puerto Rico and then go to destination she's always wanted to go to in Europe  later in the year. Part of the reason is because I won't have my passport  renewed until late july/ August but we still want a warm weather getaway in the interim. With that confidence periodically I would send her prices for flights / hotels, some restaurant ideas  for potential dates but not much follow up.    \n\nIn the last 2 months or so every time I brought up PR casually she would say \"oh maybe we should do Honduras instead\" \"oh i saw this thing on social media about Panama being cheap but luxe experience \" or some other island spot similar ... when she knows even if I wanted to go to those places (I don't right now ) I don't have a  passport. \n\nFinally I decide to be proactive. Often times I have work on the weekends while she does not. But as soon  saw an opening in the schedule for May where I was free i let her know.  I told her  (and have continuosly let her know)  if she didn't want to do PR anymore for whatever reason while a bummer it would be fine  so I can release the stress of thinking \" we have go together\" and I can bookmark it as part of separate group trip or go solo dolo . Each time she's said no while she is less interested than original time we were supposed to go she's fine with only caveat it has to be under x budget. \n\n Now that we finally have a date range I send her info. She then tells me because she wants to pickup an extra work shift instead of 4 night trip she wants to do 3 nights. That's  not really enough time to see much of anything in my opinion but i get creative with flight times to maximize daylight hours  and find better priced hotels so we can still do one or two major excursions and  to stick to budget. I then mentally bookmark to circle back to the island on my own later to finish what I missed. \n\nOutcome was that she didn't sit with me to book flights/ lodging in time so now the trip is over budget for both of us and thus we can't go :/ :/ :/ I had to be the one to make the call to call it off.\n\nThis is a good long term friend of mine, and while she was not being malicious it's a bit too convenient as she was already giving me flaky vibe leading up to this. \n\nShe said \" oh let's reschedule for later in the year\"  but honestly... it hasn't been an enjoyable experience pursuing her for this + every time I had to rescan prices with dates keep  changing it took a lot of my time that I would have rather spent doing literally anything else. Also I'm annoyed as I don't get much break this time of year. I was looking forward to do some kind of trip/ long pto to allign to weekend break. If she had told me early on she didn't want to go I could have done something else. \n\nI feel she's not invested at all as she didn't have to the legwork in the original planning and each time it has been me bringing updated info to her platter for reschedule. \n\nTo be honest this experience has me side-eying her for later Europe trip. I plan to have a (separate) conversation with her on that as I want her to take the the lead in planning. If she wants to turn small talk into reality I would like to see her put skin in the game in terms of giving her time, especially as it's her idea to go.\n\nBack to the original topic, any advice for how I can frame the conversation well so that whenever I have time again to go that  I want to take PR trip without her?\n\nFor me life is too short to keep waiting around and I feel like I've been more than fair by being flexible with all of the pivots she's given and giving her several  opportunities so we can go together. \n\nAt same time I don't want to shut the door on future vacations together as we've had fun in the past.",

They can choose to make it work and join you, or not.\n\nThis has been my strategy every time dealing with friends/groups. So much \"we should\" and talk, but nobody ever takes action and life will pass you by.",

My travel companions kept saying they were committed, but never did anything to commit and so I finally decided I could no longer wait and book the trip without them\u2026 and I haven\u2019t really looked back. Sure, there are trips where I may enjoy the company of others\u2026 But I never plan around them anymore\u2026 or else I would never go. I\u2019ll tell people these are the dates I\u2019m going and if you want to join me, great. If not, I\u2019ll see you when I get back. No hard feelings for any of us.",

Maybe she's dragging her feet because she doesn't want to let you down by saying she's not going?\nAnyway I'd just be honest, not much else you can do - otherwise you have to spend a lot of money on a trip that you're not really happy about that's set to someone else's schedule. It's situations like that that really cause rifts in friendships - especially when travelling.\n\nMaybe say - You don't feel like she's interested in going, and it's been stressful planning alone. But it's okay as you would actually love to go by yourself, and go elsewhere with her. However, a boundary for you is that the planning of a furture trip is done together so that you feel its both your trip, as you don't wanna go away with bad feelings towards the situation from her not contributing.",

I've never made her feel like i would be sour grapes for her simply having a change of mind. It would have saved me a lot of headache and current sour grapes if  she flagged upfront LOL\n\nDue to work schedule + trying to avoid wet weather with hurricane season PR will most likely be nov/december or spring next year even as solo. Considering that's a long ways away,  i will see how europe conversation/trip planning goes (I'm not going to initiate or take point in planning) first before borrowing your point on stress of planning alone.",

            "comment": "Ah, the Flaky Friend - a common character in the \"I started solo traveling when ...\" stories.  When I get the occasional, \"Omg.  That's sound so fun.  I wanna go.  Next time, let me know.  Don't go without me,\" I say okay &amp; that I'll let them know.  And then I let them know.  They almost never come through.    \nMy way of keeping the peace is finding a naturally-occurring-deadline (idk what to call it). I will find a museum showing, concert, event, or holiday season that I have an interest in months or even a year in advance &amp; tell them, \"Hey, I'm headed to Narnia for the Turkish Delight Festival held on the first day of Winter.  If you want to fly with me, I'm booking on Aslan Airways &amp; staying at Reepicheep BnB.  I need to book by \\[date\\] or prices are going to skyrocket.  If you want in, we'll book around your schedule.  If you've changed your mind about going then let me know if you want rose or pistachio flavor &amp; I'll bring you some back.\"    \nThat way it's not your fault that you need them to shit or get off the pot.  It's the Monarch butterflies' fault you need to go to San Juan Capistrano by March, Mardi Gras' fault to get to New Orleans by February, or a pooping log's fault if you want to go to Catalonia for Christmas.  I googled \"special events in Puerto Rico\" &amp; got this [site](https://www.discoverpuertorico.com/article/annual-festivals-puerto-rico) if you need some ideas.  But if you've been wanting to explore PR since 2021 then you probably have some deadline-ideas already.  I hope that helps &amp; I hope you go &amp; have tons of fun.",

It actually was a pain point (for her) in the past that I would plan vacations on my own  without inviting her.... but now we have evidence  she's not focused on  spending time to make this trip together happen. I think if softer conversation strategies don't make dent that I'm serious about going alone, I will borrow your note to find a specific event. Considering work and my desire to avoid rains with hurricane season, even on my own this will probably be end of the year or spring 2024",

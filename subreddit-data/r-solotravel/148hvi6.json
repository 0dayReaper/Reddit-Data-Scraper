    "postText": "I just recently spent a week in Mexico and stayed in a couple of hostels while I was there.  For one of them, the billing charge has completely disappeared when I log into my credit card account online, as if they never charged me at all.\n\nOn June 2nd, I checked into the hostel.  They charged my card for 3 nights, and it immediately showed up as a \"pending\" charge.  Fine, this was completely expected behavior.  I assumed that it would be \"pending\" for a few days and then post as a proper charge.  I checked out on June 5th.\n\nThat's not what happened!  It stayed as a \"pending\" charge for a few days, and then it completely disappeared from my credit card account.  It doesn't show as a \"pending\" charge or subtract from my available credit on the card.  It's like the transaction just disappeared.\n\nHas this happened to anyone else, and if so how long did it take for the charge to show back up?  From a cursory search online it seems like it's not a completely uncommon experience.  I'm pretty thorough about keeping track of my expenditures so it's kind of annoying that this charge is taking forever to go through.\n\n**EDIT ON 6/14:** \n\nIt finally posted last night!  And on my credit card account the transaction date is listed as 6/12, so apparently it's an entirely separate transaction from the original pending charge when I first checked in.  \n\nNo surprise to most people here I'm sure, but I'm just glad it didn't linger any longer like I worried it would.  Thanks to everyone who's responded here.",

Get a contact and extension for a bank rep.\n\nIf you bank doesn't do it, I'd call the hostel and get them to hash it out with the bank. Not on you so why should you work hard to fix it. Keep your receipts too. Sorry you have drama.",

I woke up on my third night in the hotel and had and extra $1500 in my account and I realized it was the amount I paid for the hotel, but there was no record of it in my transactions. But, a couple days after I checked out the money was removed from my account. I\u2019ve used booking probably 200 times in the last eight years, and I\u2019ve never had it happen any other time.",

If there is a communication or technical glitch, sometimes the confirmation doesn\u2019t hit the processing company. After hanging for a few days without confirmation, a lot of bank card companies will drop the charge from your account. The vendor will likely find the imbalance in their books at the close of their fiscal period and reach out to their processor to correct. Hence the comments about a month or 3 months later it suddenly reappears",

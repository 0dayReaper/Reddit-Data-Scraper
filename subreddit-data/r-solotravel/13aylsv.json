    "postText": "hello.\n\nI am a Korean male in my mid 20's. In January 2023, I was going to leave Korea and travel to Canada. However, I was denied entry because I was suspected of residing in Canada illegally.\n\nIt was planned for the past year, and it is my first overseas trip. When it was denied entry, I lost my confidence and stayed in my room for four months. It wouldn't be common sense to be so frustrated. I could rationally plan to get back on my feet, but I was emotionally broken. For my first overseas trip, I even quit my company and informed all my friends. It felt so great to me that I was rejected by a country.\n\nAn idea came to my mind a few days ago. Can't live like this forever. I decided to prepare for my second overseas trip. I absolutely hate being denied entry on this trip again. So, I would like to share my concerns with those who have traveled abroad and prepare by listening to their answers. Below is what I am curious about.\n\n1. If I try to travel to Canada again, will the Canadian immigration officer give me a travel visa? At that time, I tried to get a tourist visa, but it was rejected because of the suspicion. Now I have been thinking that i have no way to go to Canada for travel purposes and I will be foreverly constantly rejected unless there is a very special reason. Can I enter Canada on a tourist visa? If possible, what preparations should be made for it?\n2. If i plan to travel to a country other than Canada, there are also some concerns. As far as I know, during the immigration process, \u201cHave you ever been refused entry from another country?\u201d i have to answer the question called. I have to answer \u201cYes i am\u201c because I've been rejected in Canada. This answer would be an innocence that undermines my credibility. Because of this, i will not be 100% denied entry in that country, but I think i need to be more prepared than other general travelers. What additional preparations should I make to enter a country other than Canada?\n3. Am I too sensitive to the trivial happenings of the past day? At that time, the immigration officer just gave a light message saying, \u201cPlease come prepared again\\~\u201d, am I just taking it seriously? Maybe all the questions above are overly sensitive? Or rather, is it a fixed sentence that will never set foot in Canada again? I would like to ask seniors in life who have gone through a similar situation to mine.\n\nSorry for the long post. I would appreciate it if you knew that my heart is desperate as like this lenght. You don't have to answer all of my questions, you are welcome to answer just one or two that you know. In addition to the questions I have written, if you have any stories that might be helpful to me, it would be better if you tell me all of them. Whatever you say will be great and valuable information for me now. Thanks for reading this long post.\n\n&lt;I'm not sure which reddit channel is the most appropriate, so I'll post it in several related places. Sorry if the post is duplicated.&gt;",

The last time you tried to visit Canada, did you have a return flight booked? A job back home? A set purpose for your trip? Having answers to common questions like the purpose of your visit, the length of your stay, and where you plan to go is pretty standard stuff. \n\nA past refusal of entry doesn't necessarily mean you'd be denied the next time around. But you will definitely want to make sure to have all your documents in order.\n\nAlso, did you apply for and receive your ETA before travelling to Canada? Maybe that's why you were denied entry last time. All Korean citizens (like most other tourists) need to apply for an ETA and have one before entering.",

It might not be enough to justify a denial on its own (after all, people talk on this sub all the time about quitting their jobs to travel), but combined with other factors like not having a return flight booked, not having a set itinerary, and/or not having clear commitments to return to in their home country, I could see it. Canada's border is a lot tougher than e.g. most EU countries in terms of wanting concrete documentation.",

            "comment": "One of my closest friends was denied entry from Canada because she actually WAS planning to work illegally and got caught. She was able to return the next year and now lives in Canada legally with permanent residence! For a few years she would get asked about it every time she crossed the border (because they flag your passport), but she would explain that she made a mistake once, learned from it, and came back legally. She has always been let back in to Canada without problems.\n\nWhen the border officials denied you entry, did they give you a concrete explanation and/or tell you what the red flags were that caused them to refuse you entry? Unfortunately Canadian border officials can be quite tough, and their job is to look for signs that someone might be looking to enter and work illegally or overstay their visa. These are things like:\n\n* Not having a job in your home country, or quitting your job right before you travel (I'm guessing this is what most alarmed them)\n* Not having significant commitments/ties that would require you to return home (e.g. being single/unmarried, no job, no mortgage or rent to be paid back home)\n* Not having a return plane ticket\n* Not having specific plans / a specific itinerary\n* Not having accommodation booked\n* Not having proof of sufficient funds for your trip\n\nThese are all things that you can prepare for when you travel next time. Make very concrete plans (including full hotel bookings and a return flight) and bring proof of everything.\n\nIn terms of your second question (other countries) - if asked, just be honest. Explain that it was your first time travelling abroad and you weren't prepared for how tough the border officials would be, but that you learned from the experience and now you're more prepared. You're not the first person to have border problems and officials can be more understanding than you think. You might get additional questions and be asked to provide additional documentation (e.g. proof of bookings), but it will be OK.\n\nAnother question: did the Canadian officials \"refuse you entry\", or did they \"allow you to voluntarily withdraw your application to enter Canada\"? I'm not 100% certain about this but I believe the latter is less serious.\n\nAs for your last question: you can still come to Canada or to other countries. :) The border official was being serious when they said that you could come back again with a bit more preparation. My friend was refused entry (after being caught *actually* wanting to do something illegal) and was still allowed back in as a tourist and was even allowed to immigrate to Canada permanently. You'll get additional questions for a while at the border, but you're definitely not blacklisted!",

I would suggest not trying that again, your life will be much better off if you get a Canadian work visa and go through their immigration process.\n\nIf they catch you trying to stay in Canada illegally again, you may be denied entry forever.",

So I don\u2019t think that will be your issue. \n\nI know we care quite a lot about things like: return tickets, being able to financial support yourself (having some proof of funds), itinerary, etc. Some tourist spots like Whistler often have foreigners working there (I met a few Aussies who came to work and I was a bit surprised lol). Also having some proof of something to return home to helps (car, house, job, partner, school etc). \n\nI\u2019d suggest watching Border Security to get a better idea of our border crossing. \n\n\nThe good thing about Canada is we don\u2019t have a bribery issue like some nations do when entering/leaving. So it might be tough but it\u2019s outlined somewhere.",

            "comment": "&gt;I will be foreverly constantly rejected unless there is a very special reason. Can I enter Canada on a tourist visa? If possible, what preparations should be made for it?\n\nThat's not usually how these things work. You can expect your future applications to be scrutinized more closely, but simply getting denied for a visa isn't going to prevent you from ever getting a visa.\n\nThis is a question you need to be asking CBSA or your local Canadian embassy staff. If you've been previously denied you need to make sure you have a visa or other authorization to enter the country *before you arrive there.* Even if you'd otherwise be allowed from your country do not try to do a Visa on arrival or Visa Free Travel if you've previously been denied entry.\n\n&gt;What additional preparations should I make to enter a country other than Canada?\n\nYou want to read the immigration website of the country you're trying to visit and make sure you have everything you need. In general you're going to want to make sure you have sufficient funds and a plane ticket booked out of the country for a later date as well as a clear purpose for visiting the country.\n\n&gt;\u201cPlease come prepared again\\~\u201d, am I just taking it seriously? Maybe all the questions above are overly sensitive? Or rather, is it a fixed sentence that will never set foot in Canada again?\n\nAt least in the Western World pretty much all bureaucracies have a massive list of laws, rules, and regulations that have been distilled and formalized into a list of procedures. So don't take it personally, the border agent is just doing their job and following the rules.\n\nThey would have told you if you were banned from entry. A list of reasons they deny people is can be found here:\n\n[https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility/reasons.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility/reasons.html)\n\nReally at this point what you need to do is fill out a visa application to handle the back and forth with Canadian Immigration *before* you ever leave your home country or book a trip. I would start with an Electronic Travel Authorization and see if it gets approved. From there you can ask them about an appeal process or other visas which you can apply for if needed.",

If you try again, the passport system will show that you were denied last time so be prepared to really answer questions etc this time.\n\nWith all countries they want to be convinced you are not coming there to work.  Have nothing with you that would be considered work stuff,  no diplomas, certificates etc.   Have a real live itinerary of what you are going to see,  make sure you have enough money to support yourself for the time you are coming in for and a return ticket.\n\nThey have many shows on Youtube showing TSA shows in Canada and Australia,  you should watch them so you have a better idea of what not to do.",

Without these three aspects, they typically have grounds to refuse you entry.",

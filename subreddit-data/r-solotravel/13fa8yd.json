    "postText": "Hi all. I plan on going to Australia in September and am looking at applying for my visa now. I have filled out the majority of it all without any problems. The only issue I am having is the proof of funds. It says you need $5000AUD which I have and then proof of funds for onward travel on top of the 5k. Does this mean enough money to fly back to the UK or just enough to get a flight out of Australia? I currently have $5687 AUD would this be proof enough or should I wait a few more weeks and save some more?",

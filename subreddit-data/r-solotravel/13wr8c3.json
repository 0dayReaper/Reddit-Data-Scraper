    "postText": "I\u2019m in Ninh Binh right now. \n\nI planned to go to Sapa tomorrow, and it seems to get the best out of the area, involves a lot of hiking. Which I want(ed)to do. \n\nBut to tell the truth, I\u2019m knackered and my body is. Maybe I\u2019m a little burnt out from travel and the crazy heat or whatever. \n\nHow worthwhile would it be to travel there if I don\u2019t intend to do much hiking? \n\nWould it be a waste of time, and better spent elsewhere in the region? I only have 7 days left so I don\u2019t want to go south. \n\nOr should I just push through the tiredness and go as it\u2019s supposed to be amazing? \n\nI\u2019m pretty fit and young so I\u2019m not worried about keeling over or anything lol but right now I just feel like I CBA. \n\nThanks",

So I\u2019d say go for it but that\u2019s just my way of traveling. Sometimes you really do need a break though and only you\u2019ll know",

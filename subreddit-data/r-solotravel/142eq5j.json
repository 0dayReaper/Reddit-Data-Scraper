    "postText": "Hey there! I'm looking for some inspiration for my trip to Greece in July. Because of other circumstances I'm starting on Corfu and from there I have 2-3 weeks not including the time on Corfu.\n\nI want my trip to be a mix of \"must see\" islands, very small tropical Islands and party Islands.\nAnd is it even possible to find hostels during the trip?\n\nThe itinerary I've been thinking about so far is:\n1. Corfu\n2. Paxos/Antipaxos?\n3. Lefkas?\n4. Kefalonia \n5. Zakynthos\n\nAnd from there I'm pretty much in doubt. The rest of the islands are pretty far from here. So do I go through Athens and then to the east islands? Or do I make my way all the way around? \n\nOther islands I've noticed are Simi, Paris, Skiathos, Mykonos and Kos.\n\nHoping for some good help, maybe an itinerary and some experiences and suggestions in terms the islands!",

It will be almost at its busiest in July but seriously I highly recommend it.\n\nTry to take a boat tour that will take you to the active crater and also take you swimming in the hot springs (they're not as hot as you think but it's a unique experience).  Also try to visit the ancient city of Akrotiri. It is the greek version of Pompeii, a whole city encased in ash. Also try to visit the red beach for what is in my opinion an otherworldly look. \n\nAdmittedly I didn't go solo last time but my mom (we're greek) insisted I take my partner there and stay at least 2 days. He loved it :) \n\nFinally mykonos is a party island and a relatively short boat ride away from santorini. It is probably the most expensive island tho so that's something to keep in mind. \n\nLmk if you have any questions I can try to help with",

            "comment": "Zakynthos is incredible! The big question would be if you\u2019ll be renting a vehicle while traveling. Zante town is just lovely\u2014 albeit small. This island is less expensive than some of the others (Mykonos, Santorini). I will say, some of the coolest things on the island would require renting a car or chartering a vehicle. You can also rent quads for less $ and access most if not all of the cool things that my SO and I saw while we were there. \n\nHave you driven there before? It was an adjustment for sure. But so absolutely worth it. \n\nWe stayed in a motel/inn for a couple days and it was reasonable. I did not notice any hostels but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t there, we just weren\u2019t actively on the lookout for one. \n\nSunset Taverna down at Porto Roxo on the west side of the island is a great place to camp out for a day\u2014 they are a full service restaurant and bar, and their beach chairs are free to hang out in. For a small fee (~$11usd for as long as you want to stay) you can reserve these little beach beds under thatched shade roofs. There\u2019s a little staircase/jumping off point where you can swim. We practically lived there when we visited. \n\nKeep in mind that you\u2019ll possibly want to buy or bring water shoes or something to protect your feet, as the majority of the island is a pumice-like stone surface and where the beaches *do* have sand, it gives way to big, round golf ball sized rocks pretty quickly. Swimming in the Ionian Sea is an absolute treat. \n\nHave fun! If you have any questions or are looking for specific recommendations don\u2019t hesitate to give me a shout. I\u2019m forgetting a lot of details but our time there was magical. You\u2019ll love it!",

            "comment": "You should check out the ferry schedules and routes first. Its not as straightforward to go from Island A to B in Greece, and flying will almost always involve a change of planes in Athens. \n\nAs far as your islands list is considered:\n\nMust see - Mykonos and Santorini, by a mile. Also Rhodes for Crusader history, and Milos for the beaches and coast. Crete too, but I don't think you should attempt squeezing it here. \n\nParty - Mykonos. Santorini too in the high season.  Ios, if you're on a budget. Zakynthos not as much. \n\nSmall Tropical - Nothing 'tropical' in Greece. Kefalonia and Zakynthos are green, but the vegetation is European, not equatorial. As for small, there's plenty - Serifos, Sifnos, Folegandros... - basically anything on the map is worth a stop. \n\nI'd personally not spread myself too thin, and focus just on 3-4 islands. I'd probably do a Mykonos to Santorini via an island or two (Milos for the coastline, Folegandros for some quiet time), or do just Mykonos, Santorini, and Kefalonia, stopping a few days at Athens in between (it's worth a stop, and you'll actually find the great nightlife here).",

Ferries can get packed in the high season, especially between the main islands, so try to firm up your plans at least a few days in advance. \n\nMeanwhile, away from the main islands, ferries tend to sail at very odd hours or just on specific days of the week (or both). It helps to know in advance what the schedule is so you can atleast broadly plan your time. \n\nAlso, the ferry system can be a bit confusing with slow boats and fast jets and various classes and e-tickets and multiple companies and whatnot. It\u2019ll just save you some anxiety if you look those smaller details up and know what to expect. It\u2019s not difficult, but there\u2019s some homework there worth doing.",

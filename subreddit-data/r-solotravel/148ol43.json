    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019m a 24yo man from Norway travelling alone for the first time. I\u2019m staying on vacation in Parga-greece for two weeks, I have been here before as a child eith my parents, but now I am returning as a young man who happens to be gay, which could maybe make travelling to certain places harder(?)\n\nWhat I\u2019m wondering is how I can make this  a safe vacation for me, maybe you don\u2019t know the town, but does any of you know how it is travelling to and staying alone in Greece as a queer person? Do I need to avoid doing/saying anything or am I free to just be myself?\n\nAll in all, how is it like being/coming out as queer in greece?\n\nAlso if you do know Parga and know of any lgbtq+ friendly spots/places nearby that would also be great!\n\nI know I\u2019m asking alot, but I just wanna feel safe on my vacation :)\n\nAlso: any general tips for travelling/vacating alone would be much appreciated! And feel free to ask questions!\n\nThank you!",

Most people don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s private lives, as long as they keep it private. You can\u2019t just go to a country and expect them to be as progressive as San Francisco. It\u2019s their country and you are a visitor. If you want to go be obnoxiously gay in a country that\u2019s anti-LGBT, pick a different country.\n\nRespecting customs is part of being a tourist. If I\u2019m on a train in Japan, I\u2019m going to speak more quietly and use more respectful language than I would on a train in Philly. Im not gonna complain about not being able to be myself, because I\u2019m grateful to be there and respectful that they have their own customs and are a more reserved culture.\n\nIt\u2019s unfair that they might be bigoted against you, but noone is forcing you to go and being granted a visa is a privilege that alot of entitled tourists take advantage of",

As others have commented, GR is very oriented towards tourism from northern Europe, so if they chased away gay white men they would have been out of business. That being said, in a smaller town like Parga there will definitely be people negatively predisposed. In big cities they exist as well, but it would be hard to find a space where their negativity will go uncontested. \n\nSo in a small town, if you wear make up or a skirt and try to enter a local cafe, it's very possible that the manager will tell you it's all booked, or maybe they will be itching for an excuse to argue. Use your gut feeling. If someone is driving a farmer's truck, if a priest or monk is sitting in a table, if it's a huge group of men only sitting together, these are indications of not very progressive people. Additional attention when you flirt with people. \n\nAs a general idea I think in Greece you don't have to be careful before the fact, but be prepared to back down if the tension does come. The bystanders or police might not be eager to help you if a local accuses you of starting the fight.",

Do you think no one looking at you would have been able to tell you saw someone you thought attractive?\n\nGay friends and colleagues deal with street harassment or even violence when they are alone, in shirts and cargo shorts, or in office wear, not looking at people, just on the way to work or home. Men I wouldn't have known were gay until they told me deal with this. \n\nIt isn't as easy to hide as you think, even if you want to or if you are already just happy wearing the 'blend in' clothes. If you are not with a partner, not looking at the gorgeous greek men. If you are being careful about how you walk, move, talk, what you say etc. \n\nVisiting a country where you have to adjust for safety is a choice. It may be easy, it may be hard. And part of finding out about potential safety concerns can be asking people with experience in the region, which is what OP was doing.",

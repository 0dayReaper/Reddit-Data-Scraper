    "postText": "Hi guys, I've done a lot of solo travel but never to Central Asia. I'm really interested in history and culture, and nature, I think I'm gonna love it. I read a whole book about Kazakh history and was fascinated. I'm going end of June. Also wondering how long people recommend for these 3 countries. \n\nI fly into Almaty late at night and have booked 5 nights there. I want to go to museums, see soviet architecture, try different food and cafes, go on some day trips to the lakes and mountains.\n\nAfter that I plan to go to Bishkek &gt; Karakol &gt; Osh. And stop at places in between. Not sure exactly which places I would stay the night. \n\nFrom Osh to Uzbekistan &gt; Tashkent &gt; Samarkand &gt; Bukhara. My flight out to Europe will be from Tashkent. I haven't booked that flight yet. \n\nI'm getting nervous about not speaking russian and getting between the cities by myself as a solo female. I read you just go to a bus station and look for the marshrutka(mini van) with Bishkek written in the window etc. Pay cash(it's really cheap) and get on. I'm worried about safety at the bus stations, harassment, being in a dangerous situation. And not being able to book bus tickets ahead. I read trains are easy in Uzbekistan. I'm most worried about Kyrgyzstan. \n\nI love going with the flow but I need to know I'm gonna have a place to sleep and not be sleeping on the street.. \n\nWondering about other people experiences in central Asia? Especially as a solo woman.",

In most bus ares there are loads of people yelling the names of where the bus is going, so you don't even need to find the sign in the window (which will usually only be in Cyrillic anyway).  Its a very safe part of the world, and unless you're wandering around very late at night, you are unlikely to have any problems.  Also, you could always just hire a private taxi and skip the buses altogether. Its not an expensive part of the world. Trains are easy in Uzbekistan.  \n\nI hired private drivers for everyting in Kyrgyzstan, as I didn't want to burn lots of time waiting for buses.",

I think it was 50 USD  each for 12hrs and we shared it with 3 people instead of 4. An seriously epic drive. But get a fast car. Don't take a crowded minibus. We picked a  Japanese Right hand drive V6 Camry. \n\nThen bussed from Bishkek to Almaty.\n\nSuper easy. Download Yandex translation and Taxi Apps..change your google play store location if your country has sanctions on Russia.\n\nGet local sim cards and life is a breeze with instant translations.\n\nAnd if you're tall, always request a bottom bunk for a train in Uzbekistan or Kazahkstan. \n\nCaravanistan is the best travel wiki Ive ever seen. Loads of good info and forums are awesome.",

Got right out, stored my luggage with the museum, and then arranged a car to take me to Kiva in under 3 hours. IIRC, it was about $20-25 -super cheap. Basically, any car on the street is potentially a taxi, but for such a long trip I just asked the museum staff. After a bit of bargaining, a car materialized very quickly. \n\nDidn't have the extra day I would have needed for the Aral Sea. But Kiva was sublime. Taking pictures in the late afternoon and evening after the tourists had gone from the old city, one could easily imagine yourself transported to the time of the Timurid empire.",

I think you\u2019ll be fine! But still, only use Yandex and Bolt because even in otherwise safe places taxi drivers are still scammers most of the time. \n\nI\u2019m sure you are gonna have fun!\n\nPS: it takes 2-3 days to learn Russian alphabet so I really recommend you to do that. Maybe keep a note on your phone with the names of the places you want to visit in Cyrillic so that it\u2019s easier for you to catch the right bus at the station.\n \nPersonally when I travel to countries where people don\u2019t speak English I always learn things like \u201ccan I order\u2026\u201d, \u201ccan I get the bill please\u201d, \u201cchicken\u201d, \u201ccheese\u201d, \u201comelette\u201d etc, like basic words in local language so that I can read the menu and order food even in places where they don\u2019t have English menus. It doesn\u2019t take much time and it makes your life easier. Also, it amuses locals hah.",

The thing is, as a tourist you\u2019re going to be out all day exploring the tourist attractions while Russian relocants work 9-5 and then if they go out on the weekends they just meet their Russian friends and mostly hang out in bars for relocants (there are plenty of them all over Uzbekistan, Georgia, Armenia etc).\n\nRussian people rarely go out of their way to interact with foreigners. Most (not all but most) of Russian relocants who chose Central Asia as their new home did it for a reason: they don\u2019t speak English so they had to choose a country where they can speak their native language. So yeah most of them have no interest in interactions with an English-speaking crowd anyway. So you\u2019re worried about the scenario that is very unlikely to happen, really. Also most of the people who moved abroad because of the war are pretty liberal and they are sick and tired of the war and they are angry towards the government of Russia not towards any other country.\n\nDon\u2019t stress over it, it\u2019s gonna be fine :)",

Getting between cities is incredibly easy by train (you have to book ahead sometimes) or by shared taxi's (although the taxi drivers are the usual assholes). Yandex is their uber and will work in Tashkent, Samarkand, and Bukhara. I would not worry at all about safety. Yes, there is a pretty big language barrier and most people do not speak English, but it's so easy to get by on google translate and communication with your hands. I literally do not know any Russian or Uzbek at all except for thank you, water, and bread. Hostel/hotel workers often speak a bit of English so they will help you out. Central Asia is absolutely incredible and feels untouched by Western travellers. It's such an adventure and you will love it, I promise you that.",

I took Yandex taxis everywhere (regret not taking the metro). Only issues I ran into was my drivers not being able to find me but I gave my phone to locals to talk to them. Most hotel staff speak English but I mostly had conversations via google translate. The English skills were better in Almaty amongst the young people.\n\nI went to Tashkent, Samarkand, and Bukhara as well. I booked my trains all last minute so ended up getting the 4 hour train. I got my tickets to online to Samarkand but I think the site was down and got my Bukhara tickets at the train station. Feel free to message me if you have any questions.",

Even though I didn't go solo, I think you\u2019ll be fine, there were also a few European women travelling solo and they all shared they were feeling safe and comfy in general.\nWe found marshrutkas to certain places were very unreliable in time, although for the Bishkek-Karakol route there was at least one every 30 min.\nWe did a horse trip from Kyzart to the Song Kul lake staying in different Yurt tents which I 100% recommend (best part of the trip), you should be able to arrange it in any hostel in Bishkek. Btw, the marshrutka to Kyzart was supposed to leave at 6 am and we ended up having to arrange a taxi at 10 am because they don't leave until they\u2019re full, and it didn't seem to be leaving any time soon and we didn't want to miss the tour. From that point except in super busy areas we ended up hitchhiking (which even other solo women did), since it's still very attached to the culture from the soviet union times.\nPeople don't usually speak English, however they're very friendly and they always make an effort to help you. I would recommend learning how to translate from Cyrillic characters to Latin tho, it was very useful.",

Like I'd check out a train schedule on the website but it was so confusing. So I'd google around for a blog post on it. Invariably the blogger would have a more accurate description and explanation. You could also follow specific accounts that promote travel in those places and DM the creators. \n\nFailing that, I usually book a day trip or group tour to a specific attraction.

As you said, it is pretty straightforward to get between cities: go to a bus station, find a mashrutka with your destination sign, and wait for it to fill up.\n\nAnother tip, exchange your cash at any of the plentiful exchange shops around kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan. They offer great rates and no commission. Uzbekistan is different, you need to exchange your money clandestinely at a shop/market to get the unofficial rate.",

Her driver fell asleep twice on the mountainside and she had to grab the wheel. Don't do it, when it's not that much more expensive. Trains are the way to go in Uzbekistan. Easy to buy online (at least with a Visa). I flew a good bit in Kazakhstan, just because it's so vast, but crossing between countries is quite easy.

I could stay as long as the visa-free period allows, but unfortunately only in places with good wifi and it's hard for me to take 2+ days off at a time, so I figured Almaty &amp; Bishkek would be the best to use as bases and then take day trips from there.",

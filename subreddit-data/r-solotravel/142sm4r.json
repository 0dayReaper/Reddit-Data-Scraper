    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am headed to Portugal for 9 days in January. Because it's the off season and the weather is cooler, I am not sure what to leave off or add to my list vs the popular recommendations. For example, one of the beautiful historical places (above Sintra) has been shrouded in mist for winter travelers is my understanding, making it not the best investment of my time.\n\nOn my list already is Porto &amp; Evora to see the Capela dos Ossos.\n\nI am not a beach person nor someone who loves to party. Recommendations for:\n\n* buying cool handmade local wares for the home &amp; bookstores\n* art museums, especially painting, tiles, and textiles\n* hikes\n* hot springs/spas\n* natural beauty\n\nI also am mainly vegetarian but will eat seafood for special occasions and am flexible with stuff being cooked in broths, use of gelatin, etc. I admit I am a wuss and can't handle stuff like whole fish with the head on or octopus tentacles, but shrimp, lobsters, scallops, and fish filets are all fine. Any food recommendations (vegetarian or otherwise)?",

I'd suggest you take a drive through the duro valley and not east west but north south lots of nice scenery and many places to stop.  that part of Portugal is very rural there's also a small town in the north with hot baths",

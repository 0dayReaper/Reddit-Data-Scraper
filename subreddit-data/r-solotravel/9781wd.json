Tokyo is a huge city with an endless amount of modern activities and a good chunk of historic things to check out. \n\nKyoto is a much smaller city (1.5m vs 24m) that, relative to the size of the city, has a lot more historic and unique cultural sites. \n\nBasically if you want a slower paced more historic (but still comfortable for western tourists) city, Kyoto is your spot. If you\u2019re looking to go out at night a lot and do a lot of weird modern Japanese stuff, Tokyo is your spot. \n\nBut they\u2019re both great. ",

Otaru and Sapporo are amazing too! Tokyo  and Kyoto were the least favorite part of my trip, to be completely honest.\n\nGoogle these cities and if you like what you see, hit me.

    "postText": "Are there any people here who solo travel while in a relationship?\n\nI traveled for the first time recently, and I did it solo. I went to T\u00fcrkiye and it was incredible! It was initially part of a work trip and I tacked on a few days for solo travel. I'm sure the people here will understand the sense of accomplishment of navigating your way around a country where you don't speak the language, and succeeding. It was so daunting at first, but once I got the hang of it, I realised I loved it. I feel like I wouldn't have met the people and made the friendships I did if my partner had been with me. \n\nWe've been together for eight years and are blissfully happy, and while I would of course love to share in travel adventures with him, we just don't have the same desire for travel, and the bug has now bitten me. I know he'll happily go with me wherever I want to go next, but I almost feel like he'll be doing it just because I want to, and not because he's really as passionate about it.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Would you prefer to go it alone or have someone tag along knowing they're not as into it as you? \n\nI'm not really sure if I'm looking for advice or just confirmation that I'm not some weirdo for wanting to travel alone.",

First of all, he\u2019s not as interested in traveling and secondly I also just really like to solo travel bc it brings me out of my comfort zone and gives me a sense of accomplishment (as you mentioned), but also because there\u2019s a much bigger chance of meeting new people when I\u2019m alone. If I\u2019m with my boyfriend, we\u2019d just be hanging out with each other. \n\nThe biggest problem about this is the length of time I\u2019m going (a couple of months or a month) which makes me feel bad for him and like I\u2019m a bad girlfriend. I also don\u2019t like people\u2019s questions and (presumed) judgement (the number of times I\u2019ve been asked \u201cIf you have a boyfriend, why isn\u2019t he here?\u201d \ud83e\udd72 \n\nNevertheless, the pros outweigh the cons for me! \ud83d\ude0a",

My senses are much more vivid when I am alone, immersing myself in nature, observing animals, and interacting with the people I meet to learn as much as possible from them. \nI am fortunate to have an amazing partner who understands my desire for solo travel. Once I tried solo traveling, I became hooked on that feeling, it was quite addictive for me. The best thing is that I don't feel too sad when my trip comes to an end because I know I will come back home and see him. Although I try to travel together with him often, I don't believe it is necessary to always travel exclusively with a partner.",

We manage it just fine though!  \n\nI absolutely love this combination and am grateful he is supportive of me doing my own thing.

Be wary of the scams, they do all happen. \nI was in Sultanhamet and I walked everyone and felt very safe (solo female).

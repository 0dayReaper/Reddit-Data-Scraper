    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nFor about 6 days on June I'll be doing a solo bike tour from \u00d3rleans to Tours. \n\nAs most of the trip follows a tighter itinerary, I was planning to wing it during those 6 days, as I want to go my own pace while biking. I might get from town to town each day, explore the town and one castle by day and then sleep, to wake up early and get to the next town. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My question is if you think that I'll have trouble finding available hostels on the same day I'll be checking in (also, any other biking tour tips will be welcome!)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(PS. I might also post on r/bicycletouring but I'm trying out here first).",

I mean since I feel like everyone is always raving about the people they met.. I'm currently traveling, although I've not been here that long (3 days\ud83d\ude02) I've not really socialized much. I'm also really introverted, and spend most of my time alone at home too. *Sometimes* I can't help but feel a little jealous when I see groups of friends or couples, but then I feel like I'm just fine on my own. Just gotta work with what I have \ud83d\ude02\n\nThis is my first time traveling by myself again after the pandemic and I feel like back then I met people everywhere I went and quickly too. I feel like I was a different person \ud83e\udee3\n\nEdit: I'm definitely NOT looking for someone to travel with me. it would just be nice to talk to someone from time to time.",

Travel how ever you want and don\u2019t let other people\u2019s experiences shape your preferences. They might have fun socialising in a dorm at a hostel. You might prefer time to yourself. Do what makes you comfortable.",

And in any case, since I'm not quite of a \"hostel life\"-age, I prefer to use small family-run guesthouses, bed and breakfasts or homestays, so the chance of meeting other travelers is smaller anyway.  \n\nIf anything, I try to connect with my hosts, guides, drivers and other local people I meet during my trips more than with fellow travelers, because in my experience those connections often add a lot more flavor and opportunities (as in unique experiences) to the travel experience than drinking buddies. Which is not to say I haven't met awesome fellow travelers and hung out with them for a few hours or days, but that hasn't been the purpose of my trips for a long, long time.",

You're less attentive to your environment when you're attending to other people. Like, fellow travelers are cool, but they're not really the reason I'm visiting a place. I'd rather socialize with local people...which I try to do sometimes, but language barriers often make that very difficult.\n\nSo if I happen to meet someone by happenstance I will totally hang, but I don't seek it out and I don't feel bad if I don't really connect with anyone for an entire trip. But I'm naturally more inclined toward deep/long-term/deliberate connections with people anyway.",

The reason I chose this way of travelling is because I would like to get as much details about the foreign countries I'm living in. I would love to observe how the locals live their lives, where they frequent to shop and dine, attractions that are more popular among domestic vs. international travellers. At one point I even like to master the capital city public transport system, knowing the main streets in the central area etc. As I live there for long time, the only sustainable way for me to fund my travel was through volunteering in a hostel in a base city, then paying for the hostels at other regions in the country for mini trips. I'm an ambivert person but a little skewed towards introversion so I love the idea of both meeting people and taking time being in my own company. I think this is the beauty of being a solo traveller, you would have more liberty to set the tone for everything you do while on the road.",

These types of meetups are great imo because people actually come to them excited to meet new people.\n\nThere's an easily achievable middle ground between completely alone with your thoughts the entire time you're traveling and going clubbing every night. You can explore on your own during the day time and go to a pub meetup in the evening (without getting wasted). \n\nI'm gonna go against the grain of the top comments and say this -- I'm also an introvert, but that doesn't mean I want to spend every waking moment of existence by myself. All being an introvert really means is that your social battery gets recharged by being alone. There's mental health value in human interaction whether redditors can admit it or not, and travel is a fantastic opportunity to talk to people from backgrounds you wouldn't have otherwise met while in your home country (OP has solo traveled before, so I'm really just writing this for the sake of other people browsing this thread).",

There was another person on the tour solo. He started a conversation with me and we ended up hanging out for the remainder of the tour, getting drinks afterward, and exchanging WhatsApp. Again I needed someone else to initiate, but I had a really good time speaking with both of them.\n\nI'm going to a different hostel in a few days, I'll \"try\" to be a bit more social and initiate conversations with others.\n\nMaybe go on tours and approach people who are by themselves and be friendly with anyone who approaches you. It could be nice even if the interaction is just for the duration of the tour.",

But I do tend to put myself in situations with some reasonable amount of social activity and I talk back to people when they say something to me, and in conversations I listen more than I speak. I think that helps too. \n\nI do love doing walking tours so I can learn something. I ask questions to the guide and when they ask us, I try to answer. I hang out with people afterwards if they offer, and sometimes I am in the mindstate to offer that myself. When then go to a restaurant or a bar that is not loud. If there are concerts I am all for that. I don't like typical parties. \n\nBefore corona I always booked hostels with a shared living room (but not party hostels, screw those). That was also a way to explore the area with other people. In the morning the hostel staff sometimes tells visitors what there is to see, where a tour starts, or they offer a tour themselves. That's the way I join up. But now that I have a bit more to spend, I'd rather book something private. If it contains a shared room, then I might pick it, but I won't book shared sleeping spaces anymore.\n\n2 weeks ago I was with 2 friends in Barcelona for a festival. During the day while they slept or had breakfast, I did walking tours as well. But I didn't feel like sticking that much with other people in the 2 tours I did because I knew later in the day I would catch up with my friends anyway.\n\nAfter Barcelona I went to Valencia and Madrid but because I did so much in Barcelona for 9 days straight, I just kept to myself. I walked around town, took pics, had dinner by myself or took it to my Airbnb and chilled behind my laptop with drinks and music.\n\nBut meeting people just means you travel and sightsee together. You don't need to remain friends when you all go back to your own country.",

The first two days were very hard, not being able to share things with others.  Feeling lost. People at home were in different time zones so there was only so much chatting to do. We end up leaving messages that might take a long time to reply. Then I found my rhythm.  Decide on a destination to visit/ thing to do  each day, then explore the things to do, check out cafe near there, eat something good in the area too, and do some shopping. Your day will go very fast. Just roam around as you go. Then after all the exploring, share it with friends and family back at home at the end of your day. Which is perfect for me since we have a 12 hour difference. I will text them at night before I sleep when they are awake. We chat  for a bit and it's fun. I felt I accomplished something each day. You will meet some nice people on the way, but most likely you will not see them a second time. Just don't focus on socializing. Focus on your bucket list. I will miss this routine when I go home in another 4 days. Been traveling solo for two weeks.",

I\u2019m very extroverted, and honestly one of the things that keeps me coming back to solo travelling is the peace lol. 90+% of the time I\u2019m socializing, doing things with new friends, going out of my way to interact, meeting locals etc, but in my case, I love the break from travelling with/being with friends, old or new, or feeling like I have to socialize.\n\nUsually those stints don\u2019t last long for me, a few days to a week at a time, but it leaves me feeling very refreshed as I can tend to spread myself thin by doing so many things in short periods of time. \n\nSometimes I\u2019ll specifically choose hostels with reviews that say they\u2019re less social, so I don\u2019t end up in a super social hostel and potentially put a damper on others\u2019 hostel/travel experience by me [politely] not wanting to socialize or interact a lot. *(why not just stay in a hotel then? Or get a private room? Because I don\u2019t want to pay 3x the price)* \n\nThough I\u2019ve always been polite and explanatory, I\u2019ve ran into the issue of seeing some people seeming to be hurt by it, I\u2019m assuming because they\u2019ve went out of their comfort zone to interact with people and it didn\u2019t go as planned. I don\u2019t like seeing that, but I\u2019ve learned to be strict with myself to ensure I enjoy my trips as much as possible.",

    "postText": "I recently had a chat with some of my friends who, like me, sometimes travel alone. We got to talking about how we choose where to go on our trips. To my surprise, I found out that I was the only one who picks places based on how good the hostels are there. Most of my friends said they choose places because of the culture, the food, and what there is to see and do. But my train of thought is that all places have their own culture, food, and interesting sights. But, what they all **don't** have are quality hostels.\n\nFor me, there are/were some hostels which **made** the location. Retox in Budapest, Yes! in Lisbon, and Castle Rock in Edinburgh come to mind. The aspect of discovering a new city with random strangers really appeals to me so I found it incredibly important to be staying (or, at least have access to) a social hostel. In November of last year I booked a trip to Kyiv on the simple fact that Dream Hostel was so highly rated.\n\nI'm curious whether this decision making process is mirrored by anyone else.",

I don't care too much about facilities as long as theres a decent atmosphere/vibe.\nLike i have been to a family run hostel in naples, it really only had the very basic facilities and didnt look very great, but the flair was just so memorable i'd visit it again.\nthen i was in a hostel that was very comfy but not enjoyable at all for some reason.\n\nlike i have been to a 10 person hostel that didnt even have warm water or wifi, but its location was just soo damn great and the people were awesome... i'd stay there again at some point",

Believe it or not, there's life beyond the SE Asia and European backpacker circuit.\n\nSecond, over emphasizing a place's hostel scene takes away from experiencing your actual destination.  Going to a place with interesting and distinct culture, and then spending the bulk of it surrounded by people from the same handful of culturally similar countries in a fairly neutral environment is boring to me; I'd rather put effort into experiencing the quirks and culture shock of my destination.\n\nNothing inherently wrong with doing hostel-driven trips, and great if you enjoy that style of travel. But it's the same idea as people who build their trips to Mexico around an all inclusive at Tulum or Cabo.",

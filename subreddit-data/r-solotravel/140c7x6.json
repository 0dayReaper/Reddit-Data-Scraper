    "postText": "Hi r/solotravel! I look forward to traveling solo to Albania soon and I would love your help with planning and answering some questions I have.\n\n\r  \nI will be staying in Tirana and Himare (accommodations already booked). This trip is mostly vacation, but I will be working remote a little.\n\n\r  \nI am a very easy going and open minded traveler. I love history, food, museums, markets (and negotiating prices :D). Therefore, I'm really open to suggestions.\n\n\r  \n**Budget**\r  \nMy budget is flexible. I'm not looking for cheap, inexpensive experiences, I'm open to splurging a little, but I try to remain mindful of cost.\n\n***Question***: What is a general idea of what a traveler my spend in a day? I've seen a bit of a range, from roughly $50-$60/day to $100-$120/day. Of course this is subjective, nevertheless, getting another opinion would be quite helpful.\n\n\r  \n**Tirana**\r  \nI will be in Tirana from a Tuesday to Saturday.\n\n\r  \n**Tuesday** \\- I arrive in the late afternoon. I was planning to check in, grab dinner, walk around Skanderbeg Square.\n\n\r  \n**Wednesday** \\- I am planning to take a day trip to Berat, leave early in the morning from Tirana and return to Tirana the same day in the late afternoon. I would love your help and suggestions on what to see and how I should spend the day, including sites to see places to eat, etc.\r  \n\n\n***Question***: Is there a central website with a bus schedule? I have my bus ticket booked to Himare and know I can just go to the station in the morning for my day trip to Berat, but I'd like to get an idea of the bus schedule to get to Berat and back to Tirana\r  \n\n\n**Thursday** \\- This day I am planning to use most of the day to visit Tirana, working a little bit in the morning until around 12pm/1pm. I would love your help and suggestions on what to see, where to eat, etc.\r  \n\n\n**Friday** \\- I will be working for half the day until between 2pm-4pm and am planning to use the half / rest of the day to visit anything in Tirana that I didn't visit on Thursday. I would love your help and suggestions on what to see to.\r  \n\n\n**Himare**\r  \nI will be in Himare from Saturday until Wednesday when I will return to Tirana before leaving on Thursday.\r  \n\n\nI've already booked a bust ticket to / from Himare and beach side accommodation.\r  \n\n\nI would love any and all suggestions on what to do and see, including day trips, other beaches, must-see things and activities, etc.\r  \n\n\nThank you so much for any and all suggestions and recommendations!\r  \n\n\nCheers!",

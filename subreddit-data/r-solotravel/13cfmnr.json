    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\n**TLDR: Has anyone applied for a UK Working Holiday visa, while travelling outside of their home country before? and did it go well? (I'm a Canadian &amp; eligible)**\n\nI want to do a working holiday visa in the UK. I am visiting my friends in Beirut, and have a trip booked from Edmonton to Beirut booked, departing on for June 11th. I plan to stay in Beirut until June 30th.\n\nToday is May 8th.... If I apply and send in my application Lets say.. May 11th... is this realistic to receive the visa before my departure?? I've asked my friend and he said it took 2-3 weeks to get the yes for the visa. Is this cutting it way too short for before I fly out? I'm afraid of having the visa delivered to my house in Canada not in time.\n\nWould it make more sense to apply for the visa from abroad?\n\nTo me it doesnt make sense to fly out to Lebanon, and then fly all the way back to Canada and then fly out the the UK again.\n\nI would consider doing Workaways abroad if I had to in the meantime to wait for the visa while abroad.\n\nThanks everyone!!",

I know the earliest to submit is 6 months ahead, but I was trying to gauge what the latest time to submit could be, which isn't a set time so I wanted to gather others people's experiences and if they had applied for the visa while outside of their home country before.\n\nI have been thinking on the decision and trying to navigate job offers here in my home country which is why I haven't committed to fully applying. Those fell through so yeah, decided that I should just go for the working holiday visa. As well, I was trying to decide between the UK or the Netherlands and doing lots of comparison research, and talking to other individuals who have done it (which takes time for people to respond online lol). Its getting tight now, I know! Im stressing myself out haha. Thanks for your opinion!",

It's helped me realized that I should wait haha. 1 month is too fast, and I should just save up more money and get more experience under my belt to have a better chance at getting jobs there.",

I had a friend who went for only 5 months, but totally blew through all of his money because they could only find an airbnb to live in for the entire time. but him and his girlfriend also went the agency route to find them jobs. Ill probably be thinking of going late 2023 instead now.   \nWhat job agencies did you use?",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nBeen backpacking through Europe for the last 3 weeks now and I'm having a blast. I need to be in Angers for the Levitation France 2023 festival which is on the 27th. I'll be heading out from Leipzig on the 21st and thought I would explore france on the way to Angers.\n\nNot knowing anything about france I quickly drafted this itinerary:\n\nLeipzig ---&gt; Strasbourg (21-23) \nStrasbourg ---&gt; Dijon (23 - 25)\nDijon ---&gt; Paris (25 - 27)\nParis ---&gt; Angers\n\nI mostly enjoy walking around and explore the city and architecture. Sipping coffee and enjoy the weather. I only drink socially so wine doesn't interest me much. I think I prefer the urban vibes and city life more, but I'm willing to explore the countryside too.\n\nIt doesn't have to be all in France. I have an EUrail pass so I'm pretty flexible on trains. I'll take any suggestions. \n\nThanks y'all",

A couple itineraries to consider optimized to take advantage of the most efficient rail connections that assume 6 days total, and 2 nights in Paris at the end before Angers:\n\n - [Via Frankfurt, Brussels and Bruges](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=leipzig$0$e$r~erfurt$0$e~frankfurt$1~cologne$0$e~brussels$1~ghent$0$e$r~bruges$2~paris$2$r&amp;trans=Mixed&amp;nights=6&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;exactNights=true&amp;)\n\n - [Via Nurnberg, Munich and the Alsace](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=leipzig$0$e$r~erfurt$0$e~nurnberg$1~munich$2~strasbourg$1$r~paris$2$r&amp;trans=Mixed&amp;nights=6&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;exactNights=true&amp;)\n\nErfurt, Cologne and Ghent are worthwhile places you could stop along the way, but you're covering enough ground that it might be more sensible just to spend your time in the places you overnight.",

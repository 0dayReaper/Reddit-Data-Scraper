I haven\u2019t flown by myself on a long flight in many years, and I\u2019ve gotten anxious on planes in the past when everyone\u2019s sleeping and I\u2019m tired but can\u2019t fall asleep. Any tips? I always sleep on my stomach, so sleeping in a chair just feels terrible. I\u2019m willing to buy things that could be helpful (e.g. a neck pillow). I paid $40 extra to avoid a middle seat.",

Like a flying sensory deprivation tank would be perfection.\n\nWhat helps me at least a little is the combination of:\n\n* blindfold/eye mask\n* ear plugs\n* have a wine with dinner and then a Tylenol pm\n\nOne of those neck wrap pillows would probably be nice as well because nodding off to the side wakes me back up but I have not actually tried one.",

Both alc and tylonal are central nervous system suppressants, which means too much can damage your body and could lead to ODing. Even if it\u2019s a small amount like in wine you never know the type of reaction your body could have and you don\u2019t wanna do it mid air. Maybe try a medication like Benadryl, Dramamine, or even melatonin gummy\u2019s? Some thing that already has drowsiness properties, and don\u2019t mix it!",

Do your best to prep by testing a few different pillow shapes (I like the ones that are long snake-like shapes that can be folded into different positions), maybe try a footrest or seat cushion depending on what parts of airplane seats have been most uncomfortable for you historically, and don\u2019t drink caffeine before your flight. Try to settle yourself in - take a Benadryl or something if you feel safe doing so - and shoot for at short nap at best. That way, if you sleep for a good chunk of the flight, you\u2019ve gone beyond expectations!",

Would you be willing to write me a small prescription to help with this when I fly, and what would you suggest?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's how I did it. Granted, I don't travel solo and waking up groggy from xanax or whatever can be a little disorienting. If you do go this route, make your carry-on organization idiot-proof so you don't forget things on the plane when you disembark.",

My theory is that the subject of the video essay isn't boring enough for my mind to register the true intent behind watching it, but it's also not engaging enough to merit a wide-eyed binge. Also, the video essay would provide ambient white noise that could drown out airplane sounds.\n\nAnother tip I have is to try and get drowsy just in time for take-off. Something about the motion and pressure while taking me off lulls me into sleep quickly. I'll typically start watching a video essay as soon as I've boarded, and feel myself blanking out when the wheels go up.",

            "comment": "I always struggled to sleep on planes- til I got a headscarf from the Middle East, and wrapped that thang around the top of my head very tightly! I kept it over my eyes, and I think having something tied tightly around my head made me sleep so good. I flew from Athens to Singapore, and Singapore to Australia, and Australia to Hawaii, and then Hawaii to Chicago, all within a week of each other and that was honestly the best sleep I ever had!",

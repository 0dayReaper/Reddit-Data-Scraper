It means furnished or furnishings, and so the fitment of a room could include a bed or desk or what have you, but it is frequently used to include the idea of elements placed in an environment outside of a furniture context. Interestingly in the Webster list of recent web exampled, basically every usage is from the automotive industry, having to do with features furnished with a vehicle:\n\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fitment\n\nIt does seem like furnishing(s) could be substituted for fitment in all of these examples, but none of them are about the furniture of a room in a building, anymore.\n\nAnyway, I agree that this is the key with the ear plugs for sleeping. I find the ones that have the more contoured shape (not the ones that are plain cylinders) are okay although they are a little uncomfortable by the morning. I usually keep a cheap pair in my travel kit, although not right now.",

Once our son was born I started wearing only in one ear (I\u2019m a side sleeper so I wear in the ear facing up and the ear against the pillow gets muffled by the pillow without the earplug). This allowed me to hear my son if he was crying or needed something in the night. When I wore them in both ears I couldn\u2019t hear anything while asleep! Now I never travel without them.",

It reacts, turns into foam and conforms perfectly to your ears. They're technically disposable, so they're dirt cheap. I haven't bought them in years, but they used to be about \u00a35.

I used them on my flight and could hear some background noise, but it cut overall noise by at least half. They worked really well for me at the hostel because they cancelled out almost everything, but I could still hear my alarm in the morning.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve spent years on a journey of finding out the answer to this question. I hate noise and I want to sleep as long as I want regardless of hostel noise, light, etc. The best thing that I\u2019ve found that works and I\u2019ve been doing it for years is:\n\n1) \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Sleep mask: Google \u201cManta\u201d($35) the most comfortable mask you\u2019ll ever wear, that puts no pressure on your eyes itself yet blocks out light 100% effectively since it has eye cups. I wear it every night. It\u2019s UNDENIABLY the best \u201csleep anywhere any time of day\u201d investment you could make\n\n2) \ud83d\udd0a White noise: the correct white noise (includes bass and treble) played through ear buds (less than 80db or you\u2019ll risk hearing damage) will block out almost all noises. The occasional bit that MAY make it through is \nInterpreted by your sleeping brain as part of the white noise and you stay sleeping. Have a 10hr one I downloaded that I listen to on my phone every night\n\n3) \ud83d\udc42 Earbuds: I\u2019ve used everything from foam to rubber to almost gummy like consistency earplugs, but what I find works best is earbuds since the ability to play white noise through them means no outside sound wakes me. Fit is key here. You need a complete seal to give you the noise dampening the plugs will. I started off with a $40 pair of \u201cNeckband\u201d style Bluetooth headphones from Walmart. Worked perfectly (need a 12hr battery life minimum though so you account for 8hrs sleep time+ X hrs fall asleep time + I want to sleep in today time). \nCurrently I have a $10 wired pair of earbuds ( \u201cHUO Ji sleep earbuds\u201d on Amazon) I\u2019m trying out and they work super. They\u2019re the smallest sized buds I\u2019ve ever worn\n\n4) \ud83d\udecc Pillow. This is MAJOR important since you don\u2019t want it pressing them into your ear creating a pressure inside and therefore rendering the earbuds speakers unable to vibrate the air ( and make sound) OR digging them into your ear cartilage making it painful\n\nSolution: a cheap travel neck pillow. Put that on top of your actual pillow (or something to raise it up to the desired height) and safety pin the two arms together so they make a donut shape and there you have it. A pre made hole for your ear to go through. \n\nTo this day after 6 years of sleeping in locations like hostels, visiting family with their small kids, crashing on couches, etc etc where I couldn\u2019t control the noise or light hitting me, through those simple buys I can control everything I need to sleep as long as I want. Best of luck",

I\u2019ve tried everything. Mould them into a cone shape and press them a bit into your ear canal but mostly just all around your ear so it makes a good seal. \n\nNegative is that they can get a bit tacky when warm and can leave some blue residue in your ear. But if you want the ultimate sound dampening these are the best. The foam ones are shit and silicone ones are close behind.",

    "postText": "Hi all, I have put together a very early itinerary and I am looking at big picture suggestions on the destinations, lenghts of time, travel between places etc and also more detailed suggestions of things to do in these places!\n\n  \nIn terms of travel interests, I really want to experience the culture, especially the food (and drink!) of the region, I'd like to eat as the locals do as much as possible but maybe have a few finer dining experiences. I am interested in the history of Vietnam, particularly from the colonial period to present and so colonial influenced architecture/culture also would be on the radar.  I also want to have a period on the trip (probably the end) where I am mostly sitting somewhere nice (a beach probably), relaxing, eating/drinking and reading.\n\n1st\tFly to Hanoi\r  \n2nd\tExplore Hanoi\r  \n3rd\tExplore Hanoi\r  \n4th\tExplore Hanoi\r  \n5th\tHa Long Bay Cruise\r  \n6th\tHay Long Bay Cruise\r  \n7th\tOvernight train to Hue\r  \n8th\tExplore Hue\r  \n9th\tVinh Moc Tunnels\r  \n10th Explore Hue / Tiam Giang Lagoon\r  \n11th Explore Hue\r  \n12th Hue to Hoi Anh via bus\r  \n13th Hoi Anh\r  \n14th Hoi Anh to Datang to Bangkok\r  \n\n\nLooking for advice on the itinerary, considering doing 2 day/ 1 night cruise and add an extra day, probably in Hoi Anh?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny recommendations of places to eat, tours to do, places to stay (particularly hotels or homestays) etc etc. If anyone has a good contact, guide, driver please pass them on!",

I considered the Hai Giang Loop and will do it eventually I am sure but I am not a huge motorbike person and sadly just couldn't spare the 3-4 days to do it properly. That and a Sapa trek might have to be saved for a return visit that is a bit more adventurous!",

            "comment": "That is not a bad itinerary at all.  So many people want to fit the whole country into 2 weeks.  A few tweaks that you may want to consider, maybe not.:\n\nCut a day out of Hue and take a VIP van to Mai Chau out of Hanoi for 1 night at a homestay.  Or just give that day (or two) to Hanoi.  Hue is relatively unremarkable.\n\nIf you are reasonably coordinated you could rent a motorbike in Hue and ride to Danang and drop it off there.  This is far from the best motorbike ride in Vietnam, but the Hai Van Pass portion is nice.  You will be an illegal operator in Vietnam, so there's that.\n\nHanoi Family Homestay 2.  Hands down my favorite economical lodging in the world.  Always cool guests there.  The owner, Perfume Nguyen, is one of the sweetest people you will ever meet.  Not fancy or new, but a great experience.\n\nStreet food in Hanoi is fabulous.  Make sure you try bun rieu, banh cuon, and nem.  Perfume will tell you where to go for these things, or if you ask her she will probably take you out for a late breakfast at one.  \n\nHave a few beers at the bia hoi at the intersection of Bat Su and Hang Vai.  Say hello to Lien, the attractive 40 something owner.  She is stern faced but a very nice person.\n\nYou are really in for a treat in Hanoi.  it is a fascinating city.  At the end of July I will be there for a 90 day Vietnam visit, and I usually spend at least a month in Hanoi.  Message me if our times overlap and I will buy you a beer.",

                    "comment": "Id disagree with cutting out a day of Hue. Hue has 2 main day filling activities if you like history. A tour around the palace for 1 day of history, and a tour around the various very nice temples and tombs for another day. The palace also has some vietnam war history and the temples and tombs also have terracotta army like statues. If you really like the vietnam war you can also get another day there out of touring nearby vietnam war sites (i did). Personally id cut out a day of ha long bay. Its not good for food or history",

It's the most traditional and conversative spot in Vietnam so many travelers only stay for one day or even skip it. I especially love that you include Tam Giang Lagoon; the ride from the city to there is breath-taking.\n\nFor traveling from Hue to Da Nang, I recommend doing the Hai Van Pass; you can book the 'easy rider' option if you're not good at riding motorbike on your own.\n\nThe weather in November is not the best so be aware.",

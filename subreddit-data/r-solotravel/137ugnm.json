    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m planning a 2 week solo trip to North Vietnam in December and wanted some opinions/advice on my itinerary. I have some ideas for cities to visit and the activities I want to do, but I\u2019m not sure how many nights I should spend in each city and the order I should do them in. Here is what I have so far: \n\n- Hanoi\n    - Street food tour\n    - Cooking class\n    - Incense village tour (half-day)\n- Ha Long Bay\n    - Overnight cruise (1 night, 2 days)\n- Ninh Binh\n    - Day tour\n- Ha Giang Loop\n    - 4 day tour\n- Hoi An \n    - Getting clothes tailored\n\n- Da Nang \n    -  I heard this is a fun place to visit, but what should I do here? \n\n- Hue\n    - Is it worth visiting here, possibly to see the citadel, with my short itinerary?",

            "comment": "My 2 cents: Hanoi is a great city - I\u2019d go back tomorrow. You can easily spend 4 or 5 nights there. I suggest visiting the art museum, the war museum, and the Temple of Literature. I enjoyed a half-day jeep tour of the less-visited neighborhoods, too. If you like good beer, the Pasteur Street Brewpub is great. Ha Long Bay is spectacular, but be prepared for the van ride there &amp; back. Have a wonderful trip!",

The Museum of Ethnology, the Women's Museum, Hoa Lo, hundreds of great coffee shops, friendly locals...the list goes on.  After that street food tour you are going to want to have those dishes for a meal on the street.  Make sure that you try banh cuon and bun rieu.\n\nHoi An is Tourist Central and the custom made clothing is not particularly good.  Da Nang is a generic big/medium Asian city.  The Citadel at Hue is not worth the visit to the city.  I have visited all 3 of these places several times.  They are OK places but they don't compare to Hanoi.",

So you don't need to pick just one ne the other. I'd skip Hue since you just have 2 weeks.\n\nHappy travels!",

            "comment": "Ethnology museum in Hanoi is amazing. And you can see the preserved body of uncle Ho in Hanoi if you want! There are so many small tours all the time that if you go to both ha long and Sapa, you can just wait to see when the weather is best for each and book on the fly. I think hue is also famous for tailors. Spend time exploring Hanoi! It will take you a couple days just to get the hang of walking around with confidence in traffic! Night bus to Sapa is a cool experience. Sapa town is touristy &amp; depressing, though amazing views, but a hike in the countryside is nice. Personally, I could have done either Nin Bihn OR ha long. The first is a day trip, the second an overnight at least. Both are about the same karst  landscape. We also went to a national park and it was wonderful. Depends what you want. I like nature, art, museums, getting out of touristy places. Get your shots and eat all the food!!! \ud83d\ude03",

            "comment": "I visited Vietnam for 3 weeks in 2019. In Hanoi would recommend the puppet theatre, Hoi CHI Minh Museum, Blue Butterfly restaurant was expensive for Vietnam but really good. Overnight in Halong Bay is amazing. I spent 3 nights in Hue, visited the citadel and did a DMZ tour including Vinh Moc tunnels. Hai Van pass motorbike transfer to Hoi An was exciting, unfortunately the top of the pass was foggy the rest was an amazing and sometimes scary view. I didn\u2019t spend time in Danang but from what I heard it\u2019s a more modern city so depends what you\u2019re going for. From Hoi An also did a tour of My Son Sanctuary which I\u2019d recommend. Food imo was better in the central and south of Vietnam.",

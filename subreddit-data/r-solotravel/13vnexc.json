    "postText": "I continued my journey out of Fukuoka heading north and passing through Kitakyushu, the last major city in Kyushu. There were very heavy rains on my way and I was completely soaked through most of the ride. I kept pushing through the rain since I'm so behind schedule.\r  \n\r  \nOnce in Kitakyushu, I stopped for a night at a hotel and continued my journey. I took a quick ferry (5 minutes) across to the main Island of Honshu. I decided to hug to coast for a flatter route. I've always been surprised to find obscure American brands along my ride. I found a YMCA and ToysRUS in the countryside. I even found a statue of Elvis Presley in a small town. \r  \n\r  \nThe many outdoor vending machines have helped me a lot throughout my Adventure. I was surprised at how sophisticated they can get, I found some for Ramen, Mochi, Cake, and more!\r As I stopped to get a water bottle at one machine a man noticed my bike and my luggage. He introduced himself as Ichiro and he was a teacher of Japanese Classics. He showed me a Tanaka poem he wrote and gave a short lesson. He offered to teach me more in the evening but sadly I was only passing through that town.  I hope to return to take him up on his lesson someday. \r  \n\r  \nAs I biked through the Yamaguchi coast I was blown away by the views. Deep bright blue waters, yellow beaches, and cool winds. \rAfter traveling through the countryside I decided to stay at a small family-run hotel in Hirao called the Hotel New Hirao. They were surprised since It was rare for a non-Japanese to come to such a remote town. When I checked in I told the staff about my adventure throughout Japan and they offered to give me a tour of their city and nearby castle. I accepted and decided to take a rest day!  \nI was grateful that they drove us. I forgot how easy cars made everything. We explored Iwakuni Castle and the Kintaikyo bridge, a bridge older than the United States that was made without nails or screws. We also went to a local bazaar where we grabbed lunch. It was a very local place. I didn't notice any other foreigners there. The Onigiri was massive, I was used to the small ones from 711. I learned more about their lives and the hotel that had been in their family for 70 years. \r  \n\r  \nI thanked them for everything. Once again I was humbled by the kindness of the people of Japan and beauty of the this country.   \nPhotos are attached below!  \n\n\n[Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kfO9by_5BbL9z7AWy_7I6dY63WfnM0x5?usp=share_link)",

How tight is your shedule. Seems to be such a missed opportunity. Hope get more chances of such meetings in the future",

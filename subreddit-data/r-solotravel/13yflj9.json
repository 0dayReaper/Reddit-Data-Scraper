    "postText": "on my way back to Europe from Sri Lanka I will stop in India for one week in late August. My first stop is Delhi but as soon as I land I will go to Agra so that the morning after I will be at the Taj Mahal.\n\nThen my plan is to take a train from Agra to Jaipur, stay in Jaipur for two nights and go by train to Jodhpur where I'm gonna stay two nights and then go back, by plane, to Delhi for one night.\n\nI have to book trains and I'm facing some issues as there are no many seats with the tourist quota. So my questions are: \n\n* can I only book with the tourist quota or also normal seats? \n* what is your experience with trains and classes? As no 1class seats are available, but only 2nd or 3d...\n* do they usually get delayed or cancelled? \n* is it convenient to book them in advance or I can easily go to the station and get one when I need?\n* is it safe (I am a male (gay (but not evident))) to arrive late (maybe 00) in big stations?\n\nThank you!",

If they aren\u2019t available, another option would be to speak to a travel agent as soon as you land in delhi and check for Confirm tatkal tickets. \n\n2. 2nd AC is not bad at all. 3rd AC accomdates 6 people in same while 2nd accomodates 4\n\n3. Delayed yes, very often. Cancelled, never faced one myself in over a decade\n\n4. BOOK IN ADVANCE OR GET TATKAL ticket. You don\u2019t wanna get a ticket on the spot\n\n5. It is safe just don\u2019t get involved in PDA",

            "comment": "Indian guy, resident of Delhi here.\n\n\\- can I only book with the tourist quota or also normal seats?\n\nYou can book normal seats on trains too. Tourist quotas are a hangover of the past when bookings were manually done at railway stations and seats used to sell out months in advance leaving nothing for last minute foreign tourists. \n\n\\- what is your experience with trains and classes? As no 1class seats are available, but only 2nd or 3d...\n\nIndian trains aren't as plush as European ones, but they're very usable and reliable and safe, plus they're an essentially Indian experience. \n\nThere are many classes in Indian Railways, and [Seat61.com](https://Seat61.com) does a good job of explaining them. For your reference though, there are two kinds of classes:\n\n* Sleepers feature berths that allow you to, well, sleep. Within this, you have the normal Sleeper (SL) which is not air conditioned and has open windows. Its how most average Indians travel, and while generally safe, you'll be advised to carry a lock for your belongings and a strong nose for the toilet. Then you have 3rd, 2nd, and 1st class AC (3A, 2A, and 1A respectively), which are essentially Air Conditioned coaches. 3A has an open plan layout with 2 berths (1 lower and 1 upper) arranged lengthwise along the aisle (these aren't suited for taller people) and 6 across the aisle in an open compartment (3 each facing each other, with the middle one collapsed to allow day-time sitting on the lower berth). 2A is the same as 3A but with 4 berths in the open compartment side, and privacy curtains. 1A is essentially the same as 3A but with 4 berths in a lockable compartment and no aisle-side berths. There also used to be a First Class (FC) earlier which was essentially the non Air-Conditioned version of the 1A.\n* Chair Cars are available on shorter routes. These include general Chair Cars (2S) which are non air conditioned and feature 5-6 padded seats to a row; AC Chair Cars (CC) which are similar to 2S but air conditioned and a lot more comfy; and Executive Chair Car (EC, and on some trains special classes like 'Anubhuti') which feature 2x2 layouts and very spacious seats and generous service. \n* There are also unreserved coaches suited for poorer travellers who simply need to travel but don't have much money even by Indian standards. These are best avoided. \n\nFor your trip, I'd advise looking up CC/EC tickets from Delhi to Agra (the Gatiman, Shatabdi, and Vande Bharat trains are the best in class) and Agra to Jaipur, and 3A/2A tickets from Jaipur to Jodhpur. You can also take a very convenient overnight train from Jodhpur to Delhi. Broadly speaking, you'll be safe. Just lock your bags, and carry toilet paper and a seat disinfectant - Indian train toilets can get very dirty and even locals try to not poop while travelling on them - I often tip the coach attendant to clean the toilet extra hard so I can use it if I really need to go. \n\n\\- do they usually get delayed or cancelled?\n\nDelays will be uncommon on your routes but they can happen. India is always very hectic but not very punctual, haha. Cancellations are VERY rare. On the whole, Indian Railways is quite reliable - it will get you where you want to go but you do need to take delays in good humour. They're definitely much better an experience than the trains in Sri Lanka. Besides, interacting with locals on a train journey is half the fun. If you're more curious, do check out [Seat61.com](https://Seat61.com) which gives a tourist's perspective on train travel in various countries. \n\n\\- is it convenient to book them in advance or I can easily go to the station and get one when I need?\n\nBook in advance. ALWAYS. Use the IRCTC website, or follow the instructions on the Seat61 website. \n\n\\- is it safe (I am a male (gay (but not evident))) to arrive late (maybe 00) in big stations?\n\nYour orientation will not be a cause for concern at all (unless you're active on Grindr and then half the country will start pinging you). Arriving late at stations is also fine, all of the big and even medium sized ones have security, lighting, and atleast one food stall that opens 24x7. My only advice would be to keep your bags locked, and not to entertain seedy talkers or beggars - be firm and walk away.\n\nOther advice that you didn't ask for but could use:\n\n\\- August will be HOT, with only a slight chance of rain in Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur, and far less in Jodhpur. Think 40+ (celsius) temperatures and high humidity. I hope you realise what that weather can feel like. But if it rains, it'll be lovely even if you get stuck in jams. \n\n\\- Delhi is well worth a longer stop. Don't write it off as a transit point - it's got better heritage sites than Jaipur, and the best shopping and eating in the country. Plus the metro and uber make getting around safe and easy. It'll also give you a buffer against delays. If anything, I'd push Jodhpur out of your itinerary as it's a little superfluous and will be deathly hot at that time of the year. \n\n\\- Gay travel is largely a non-issue unless you go trumpeting about it in front of a religious site. India's LGBTQIA+ scene is still evolving, but it's not as frowned upon as it used to be, and the big cities have a thriving sub-culture. Grindr ofcourse is as much of a pain here as in any other country, but you can meet a lot of interesting people through Tinder or Bumble. Just be aware that PrEP is quite new here, so err on the side of caution if you do choose to meet people.",

Re Delhi, as you said it's worth staying a bit more, is there anything you recommend besides the normal touristy attractions?\n\nI also contacted the IRCTC and they confirmed I can book regardless of the tourist quota, so I'll be able to book whatever classes I feel like.\n\nThanks again :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank",

                            "comment": "Among the main sites, try to visit Humayun\u2019s Tomb early in the morning - preferably right when it opens at sunrise. It\u2019s quieter, cooler, and you can even spot the resident peacocks. Qutub Minar, by contrast, might be better done in the night, when it\u2019s lit up and has fewer crowds (you can combine it with a meal and drink at one of the nearby clubs or restaurants - Olive, Grammar Room, Bo Tai are some of the better choices). For Old Delhi, check if you can join a heritage walk run by INTACH, a local NGO, but if you can\u2019t, definitely see the Red Fort, Jama Masjid (not on Friday though), the Kinari Bazar area (with the Naughara Jain Temple, before it shuts at midday) and Chandni Chowk street itself. Try to go early in the morning when the streets are calmer. Lastly, an evening out by India Gate is a fun local affair and there are nice views down to the Presidential estate, and it can be coupled with a dinner out in Connaught Place.\n\nIf you\u2019re in Delhi on a Sunday morning, then check out the Farmer\u2019s Market (\u2018Earth Collective\u2019 if you\u2019re searching online, but nobody calls it that) at Sunder Nursery. Its a nice way get to know local food and handmade brands, and the Sunder Nursery gardens are quite pretty. Alternatively, head out to Lodhi Gardens for a morning walk - it\u2019s a bit of a Delhi ritual. On Thursday nights, Sufi devotional singers perform \u2018Qawwali\u2019 at the Nizamuddin Dargah (it\u2019s the grave-tomb of a major Muslim saint), and it\u2019s not an experience you can have anywhere else - getting a guide will help you make better sense of it. Among lesser heritage sites, Safdarjung Tomb is a quiet delight, and Agrasen Ki Baoli is a hidden stepwell in Central Delhi. There\u2019s plenty more, but you won\u2019t have the time for them. \n\nDepot 48 is the city\u2019s best known gay-friendly watering hole, while Kitty Su is the LGBTQIA+ club of choice. Indian Accent at The Lodhi hotel is regularly picked as India\u2019s best restaurant, while Bukhara at ITC Maurya is practically a legend. Khan Market (and the nearby Lodi Colony  Meharchand Markets) is a no-brainer go-to if you\u2019d like to check out local shops and stand-alone restaurants, while Select Citywalk and DLF Promenade are the best Shopping Malls in town. \n\nDilli Haat (the one at INA) is a great place to shop for local handicrafts (bargain friendly, but few places will accept cards). They also have a great food court where you can try out foods from all the states of India, including street foods you might otherwise feel a bit squeamish about. I\u2019d especially recommend the Momos at the Nagaland / Sikkim kiosks, and Vada Pavs from the Maharashtra kiosk.\n\nZomato is a great app to have on your phone anywhere in India. It\u2019s essentially a restaurant review and online delivery service, and you can use it to check ratings of wherever you plan to eat.\n\nFor hotels, staying in Aerocity will keep you close to the airport, but staying close to Connaught Place and Khan Market will make sightseeing easier. In any case, avoid staying at Paharganj or near the New Delhi Railway Station - it\u2019s cheap and attracts lower budget travellers, but is also very gritty and scammy, and is honestly the worst introduction to the city.",

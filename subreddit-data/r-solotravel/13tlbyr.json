    "postText": "Hi\n\nSo, I'm planning a trip to Amsterdam and since I've never been there, please rate my itinerary and give me some recommendations on where to eat (and what to eat - I really like to try regional foods).\n\nI made a line of places where I will pass and it will be something like this:\n\n**Day 1** \\- half day (arrive at city around 1 PM)\n\nDamrak - Dam Square (National Monument; Nieuwe Kerk church; Royal Palace of Amsterdam) - Negen Straatjes - The B\u00e9guinage (Begijnhof) - The flower market (Bloemenmarkt) - Zuiderkerk church / Nieuwmakt square / Chinatown district of Amsterdam - The Red Light District\n\n(two friends told me that it should be a lot for day 1 and just half a day but I really think I can power through)\n\n**Day 2** \\- full day\n\nThe Cheese Museum - Jordaan district - Anne Frank House (I have ticket purchased) - Rijksmuseum - Van Gogh (I have ticket purchased) - Vondelpark\n\n**Day 3** \\- half day\n\nSkinny Bridge - Albert Cuyp Market - Heineken Experience (I have ticket purchased) - The Red Light District\n\nAll sites are in order to make it more convenient for me to move around.\n\nI have planned another visit to the city next year where I will visit some more distant places like Windmill de Kat.\n\nSo my 3 questions are:\n\n* Ideas for other places I could be missing in my itinerary line?\n* Lunch / dinner spots for traditional Dutch food and beer (It might be a good idea to mention that I don't intend to spend a fortune). The only recommendation I have is Proeflokaal Arendsnest (I was thinking of going there for lunch).\n* What will the weather be like in June?\n\nThank you!\n\nEdit: I'm considering a trip with Those Dam Boat Guys. Can anyone share their experience?",

Ok, if that\u2019s your choice, but I normally tend to take some more time to explore or be surprised by something that\u2019s not on your to do list. \nFor traditional food you can try Moeders on Rozengracht or Bistro bij ons on Prinsengracht. \nWeather wise; it\u2019s June so most likely it\u2019ll be sunny, but do pack something for the rain as you never can tell. \nEnjoy!",

There's not a lot to choose from, and I couldn't get into one even during low season.\n\nThe food in Amsterdam was the least exciting thing about being there. It was good, but in a \"I can get that at home\" kind of good, and quite pricey. The only things that stood out to me were the street food at Albert Cuypmarkt and the Mannekin Pis fries.",

            "comment": "Other places: You pretty much covered everything in Amsterdam, but if you've never been to the Netherlands before (have you?), I'd strongly recommend going to places just a bit outside of Amsterdam. For example, public transport takes you too Zaanse Schans (although it's a touristy Disneyland, it might be interesting) or to Haarlem within minutes. \n\nFood: There isn't really a big food culture in the Netherlands. The fries, poffertjes, matjes and stroopwaffels are worth a try if that's your thing, but if you want to have a proper sit down meal, it's going to be expensive. Budget options are the automatiek snackbars (deep fried food waiting for you in vending machine restaurants, each item is usually between 1,60-3\u20ac and you can just try some) like FEBO in the red light district or the Asian restaurants in Chinatown East of the red light district. You might get some good deals there and Asian, especially Indonesian food has a place in Dutch culture because of colonialism, it's a legit choice for \"Dutch\" food. \n\nIf you're considering to eat at your accommodation, I'd recommend stocking up these items at a supermarket:\nHagelslag (sugar or chocolate sprinkles, butter a toast slice or a raisin bun and sprinkle them over it), vla, Dutch cheese of course, kipsalade (chicken \"salad\", good for bread too), stroopwaffels (place them on top of a cup of tea/coffee to get them slightly soft). That's a small selection of Dutch food items too and it fills your stomach. \ud83d\ude01",

            "comment": "Itinerary: The Rijksmuseum is massive at this itinerary you will be skipping most of it. You are planning on seeing the red light district twice to see sex workers. Be aware that the massive 'just here to gawk' tourism negatively impacts the sex workers, and that while it can certainly be a choice or 'choice' to work there, human trafficking does go on in sex work around the world, including at the red light district. At the very least, be respectful.\n\nFood: You may want to consider adding some of the most popular food in the Netherlands. Namely a kapsalon that you can get at Turkish cafeteria's, which is doner kebab, with fries, salad, molten cheese, garlic sauce and hot sauce. Very popular especially for going out drinking nights. And indo-chinese food, bonus points for takeaway, portion sizes tend to be massive. Bami (fried noodles) or nasi (fried rice) with babi pangang (roast pork in a red sauce) would be one of the most common dishes. You find indo-chinese restaurants and take-aways all over the Netherlands, in smaller places often as the only alternative to a cafeteria (fries and snacks) before the arrival of pizza. There are more food options nowadays, but it used to be close to comparable to Indian food in the UK. For quite a few Dutch people, it will be more common to eat this than the traditional stamppot.",

Don't stress if you decide to spend more time at one place and have to skip another in order to visit the places to where you have tickets booked.  Sometimes deviating from plans brings unexpected great experiences.  You can save them for the next trip to AMS!\n\nI also like Foodhallen for lunch or dinner.",

I started making itineraries as a fallback in the event he wasn't feeling well, I could still go out and do things without scrambling to figure out what to do.  But it's just my guide and I leave room for wandering because I know I will get sidetracked, lol.\n\nSometimes, I would just swap days around in the event there was something he really wanted to do on a day he was under the weather.  \n\nI'm pretty adverse to pre-booking things, but there are always exceptions!  I think the only thing we pre-booked in AMS was Anne Frank on our very first visit many years ago.\n\nI'm off to Vienna, Malaga &amp; Amsterdam in a few days, and the only things I have pre-booked for this trip are train tix to Cordoba and the Mezquita since I am making that an action-packed day trip from Malaga and Those Dam Boat Guys in AMS.  \n\nI did have Camininto del Rey booked months ago, but the operator cancelled on me, so I am on a waitlist with another group since I only want to wanted to be on a super small group tour.  I have a Plan B in place.  :)",

            "comment": "Day 1, yeah it's a lot. But strolling through the city in that area for an afternoon is fine.\n\nDay 2 looks way too packed to me. I'd say, skip the cheese museum and maybe move the Rijks to another day. Anne Frank House and Van Gogh is already quite a lot and you can easily spend half a day in the Rijks. So in the morning go to the Jordaan and grab breakfast at a bakery and explore the area. And you can end your day with some take out in the Vondalpark. \n\nOn day 3, the Albert Cuyp is a great place to grab Dutch food, as well as some other stuff. Food stalls are scattered over the market, with some more at the end (closer to the Amstel river, farthest from the metro station). \n\nConcerning the weather. June tends to be nice, like 15-20 degrees. However, this is the Netherlands, so make sure to bring a weatherproof jacket / umbrella. Note that the days are long so if the weather is nice make sure to spend time in the parks, like the locals do! But please clean up after yourself, even if the locals don't. \n\nAbout food, besides dutch cuisine, which for the cheap stuff is mainly fries, poffertjes and pancakes. There is some nice international cusine. Like middle eastern and suriname (roti is great). And of course there is the famous fusion dish name kapsalon (I'm not a fan, but you can judge four yourself). Another ethnic that is good in Amsterdam is Ethiopian, which is healthy, affordable and spicy.",

For this trip I've choosen Anne Frank and Van Gogh to go inside. So it will be one in the morning and the other after lunch.\n\nLooking forward for Albert Cuyp. It's places like this that I look for in every city I visit.\n\nTank you so much on the suggestions of the food :)",

There are no flashy specisl effects. No crazy thrilling rides. Just a few rooms with sparse furniture.  But the way its presented,  you can easily imagine two families in those tiny rooms, living there for such a long time. It was moving and heartbreaking.",

The only \u201ctraditional\u2019 food we had was bitterballen, which were good. One place we really liked was the Foodhallen. It\u2019s over by Vondelpark. It\u2019s not Dutch food, but lots of different types of yummy food from all over the world.",

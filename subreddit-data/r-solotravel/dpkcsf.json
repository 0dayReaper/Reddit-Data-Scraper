    "postText": "So I was walking to my hostel in Seoul, I was walking off of the main road so there were only a few people on the street, but it wasn\u2019t empty at all. I was listening to music and this Korean couple stopped me as I was walking and asked if I knew where the Harry Potter Cafe was. I said no sorry but I could look it up for them if they wanted me to. They were insistent that I didn\u2019t and that they\u2019d be fine and it didn\u2019t matter if they found it or not. \n\nThey were totally friendly, and asked me if I worked for NASA (I was wearing a NASA t-shirt), then asked if it was my first time in Seoul. Anyway we were standing there chatting for about 2 minutes and it was really a pleasant encounter. I admit they seemed a little too excited to be talking to me, something just seemed a little bit off. \n\nThen another Korean couple walks by and as they walked behind the couple that was talking to me the male turns to me and starts shaking his head and mouthing \u201cno no no\u201d while making an X with his arms like this \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nI acted like I didn\u2019t see anything and as the couple turned the corner the guy yelled something like \u201cthey\u2019re _____\u201d. I didn\u2019t catch what he said. \nThe girl that was standing in front of me turns and says \u201cwhat did he say?\u201d And I said \u201cI\u2019m not sure honestly\u201d. Then the girl says \u201coh it\u2019s because there is a lot of crime in Seoul\u201d then she says a few things in Korean to her boyfriend and she starts to act like she barely understands English even though they were talking totally fine before. Anyway they continued to be friendly and keep the conversation going but I cut them off shortly after, wished them the best, and walked away. They smiled and bowed to me and shook my hand and left. \n\nI admit, I always have my guard up when I\u2019m abroad since I travel alone but nothing about this seemed like they were trying to scam me. I know a common scam is for someone to take you out for tea or whatever and charge you a ton of money but they never tried to ask me to go anywhere. They were young, probably no older than 24. The look on the guys face who waved at me wasn\u2019t one of annoyance at a scam, it was more like he was scared and worried. \n\nIt was an extremely bizarre experience. I asked my hostel owner about it and he just shrugged it off and said not to worry about it. I want to know what you guys think. Thoughts?\n\nI\u2019m a 25 yo male, and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s obvious I\u2019m American since I\u2019m clearly Hispanic.",

I\u2019m actually not Korean myself and have also been approached by these cults before. My boyfriend always gets annoyed whenever we see these people bothering tourists because he\u2019s worried that tourists will get the wrong impression about Korea and Koreans. We hope this didn\u2019t put a damper on your trip! If you meet any other travellers, please pay it forward and let them know. :)",

From what I\u2019ve heard though, the people approaching foreigners are either straight up scammers or people from cults looking to make a quick buck for their cult. When cults here target foreigners they are usually not trying to recruit new members, I think. If you\u2019re interested in Korean cults, I remember there being a few posts about the topic on /r/korea",

Some (especially sincere believers in old religions) think \"cult\" is a nasty term that applies to any new religious movement (often because they think heresy is a legit spiritual crime). Some think cult is any religious movement that can be exploitative and harmful to practitioners, but then the question is how harmful/exploitative does it have to be to count. I wish every kid in high school had to spend an hour studying the Advanced Benowitz Cult Danger Evaluation Framework, where each organization is ranked from low to high on each of the following dimensions indicative of potential harm to practitioners:\n\n **1Internal Control:** Amount of internal political and social power exercised by leader(s) over members; lack of clearly defined organizational rights for members.**1**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**2External Control:** Amount of external political and social influence desired or obtained; emphasis on directing members\u2019 external political and social behavior.**2**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**3Wisdom/Knowledge Claimed** by leader(s); amount of infallibility declared or implied about decisions or doctrinal/scriptural interpretations; number and degree of unverified and/or unverifiable credentials claimed.**3**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**4Wisdom/Knowledge Credited** to leader(s) by members; amount of trust in decisions or doctrinal/scriptural interpretations made by leader(s); amount of hostility by members towards internal or external critics and/or towards verification efforts.**4**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**5Dogma:** Rigidity of reality concepts taught; amount of doctrinal inflexibility or \u201cfundamentalism;\u201d hostility towards relativism and situationalism.**5**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**6Recruiting:** Emphasis put on attracting new members; amount of proselytizing; requirement for all members to bring in new ones.**6**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**7Front Groups:** Number of subsidiary groups using different names from that of main group, especially when connections are hidden.**7**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**8Wealth:** Amount of money and/or property desired or obtained by group; emphasis on members\u2019 donations; economic lifestyle of leader(s) compared to ordinary members.**8**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**9Sexual Manipulation** of members by leader(s) of non-tantric groups; amount of control exercised over sexuality of members in terms of sexual orientation, behavior, and/or choice of partners.**9**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**10Sexual Favoritism:** Advancement or preferential treatment dependent upon sexual activity with the leader(s) of non-tantric groups.**10**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**11Censorship:** Amount of control over members\u2019 access to outside opinions on group, its doctrines or leader(s).**11**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**12Isolation:** Amount of effort to keep members from communicating with non-members, including family, friends and lovers.**12**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**13Dropout Control:** Intensity of efforts directed at preventing or returning dropouts.**13**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**14Violence:** Amount of approval when used by or for the group, its doctrines or leader(s).**14**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**15Paranoia:** Amount of fear concerning real or imagined enemies; exaggeration of perceived power of opponents; prevalence of conspiracy theories.**15**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**16Grimness:** Amount of disapproval concerning jokes about the group, its doctrines or its leader(s).**16**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**17Surrender of Will:** Amount of emphasis on members not having to be responsible for personal decisions; degree of individual disempowerment created by the group, its doctrines or its leader(s).**17**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**18Hypocrisy:** amount of approval for actions which the group officially considers immoral or unethical, when done by or for the group, its doctrines or leader(s); willingness to violate the group\u2019s declared principles for political, psychological, social, economic, military, or other gain.**18**  \n\n\n The religious folk generally don't like to see the ABCDEF applied to their home denominations.

The proper translation for \"cult\" as it's meant in English would be the word for \"sept\": \"secte\" in French, \"setta\" in Italian, \"secta\" in Spanish, ecc. Scientology is commonly referred to as a \"sept\", I would use \"culto\" in Italian for it.",

As an example, early Christianity (until about 100 AD) is often referred to as a \"Jewish Messianic Cult\" - a label that applied to many Jewish organizations looking for answers and a savior after the destruction of their Temple; of which Christianity eventually emerged on top.\n\nHowever, in the wake of multiple doomsday cults in the 1950's-1970's around the world, as well as the comparison between them and the decidedly different neopagan movement; many religious scholars (including Isaac Bonewits, the author of the ABCDEF) worked to officially redefine \"cult\" into it's modern meaning.\n\nBut know that, from a historical perspective, \"Cult\" did have another meaning - one still used in anthropology and other historical social sciences.\n\n...\n\nI would also point out that \"cult\" is beginning to apply to non-religious organizations. I have seen people referring to extremist movements, MLMs, and other political and economic organizations as \"cults\" when they appear to meet similar guidelines of controlling and exploiting members.",

I've had them follow me for blocks before, and one even pushed me into a dark alley to try to get me to talk about his religion and show me propaganda videos. I've even them evangelizing in the US once too. They don't seem dangerous, but are about as enjoyable to be around as Mormon missionaries who are high on crack.",

When you live there you just see it enough to know and it makes it into local media. But as a traveler, the scams are actually very similar and you can find scams that originated in, say, India, \"travelling\" to Europe. For example, the gold ring scam just started propping up in Prague and the Fake Monk scam has even made it to the U.S. Travel a lot and you'll see the scams repeat. Or you can arm chair travel and just youtube \"scam\" and your favorite travel destination. You'll find tons of YouTubes about various scams (and you'll find the same scams prop up in different countries.)\n\nBut I remember the Korean Cult scam distinctly because it's really bizarre because they don't seem as motivated by money. They just want you to spend a lot of time with them. They don't seem as concerned with converting you or taking large amounts of money per se. (The Chinese version of the scam, they chat you up, get you to go to a bar that seems normal but actually the menu is the scam. For example, a wine bottle may seem reasonably priced until they give you a huge bill and say the prices are listed per ounce not per bottle.)\n\nBut as a general rule, no country has people who are so friendly that they will come up to you **on the street** and ask you to go somewhere. That's a scam. Locals may come up to you and ask for your picture or try to use a little English (or French or whatever) but they will almost never ask you to go somewhere with them. And if you really do feel like being friendly and you want to know them better you should invite them somewhere you trust (like a busy restaurant or cafe) not the other way around.\n\nThe one exception: My friend, a New Yorker, was approached by two attractive women in NY at like 3 AM who immediately asked him \"Are you gay?\" He was not. The two women looked at each other for a second, then one asked him \"You want to go get breakfast?\" Thinking he was going to get scammed into paying for breakfast, but thinking it would be a fun time anyway, he accepted, and they went to a diner. Instead of him paying for breakfast, they paid for his breakfast and paid for his cab home! The only thing we can surmise is that the two women were strippers from a nearby strip club, they wanted breakfast, they didn't want to be bothered by other men, so they invited a random solo guy along as a meat shield (who they thought initially was gay.)",

I was stopped by two women (around 25ish maybe) that were super nice and started by doing some small talk (where are you from etc.) - already then I was suspicious that it's some kind of scam but continued talking to them.\n\nThey invited me to some kind of \"traditional korean ceremonies\". Said it was just some kind of \"show\" where people that are interested can watch. They were supposed to show traditional korean clothing, tea preperation ceremonies etc.\n\nI added them on Kakao and told them I'd be in touch (they wanted me to come with them on the spot).",

I followed home these 2girls after a long chat with them in the street. Arrived in this big shared house with ehm let's say 15 young Koreans. Then we started a religious ceremony involving \"bow\", wearing traditional clothes and fruit offerings for at least 30 minutes. Yes it was weird AF but hey, let's experience something new! They say it is some good luck thing. So, ok! They only ask me to buy them \"something\" at convenience store nearby. Bought them something for 5000Won (3 euros). Totally worth it imo.",

Most level headed Koreans are well acquainted with these groups, so the leaders demand their followers try to bring in unknowing foreigners for more money. Even President Park got sucked into a cult a few years ago and had to resign when it all came out.",

I told them no but I could look it up, they said no but continued to talk to me. I was in Hongdae at the time. They seemed friendly and I tend to be talkative so I continued to chat with them. The girl was primarily the one talking to me, but any time I'd ask something that might be remotely personal the guy answered. I asked, \"How do you guys know each other\" and the guy interjected \"We're siblings\". I asked \"what they did \"and the guy said \"We're students\". After a few minutes the little red alarms started going off that she was being super friendly but he'd interject any time I had a question. So I excused myself and went about my way. It wasn't till I got back to my sister-in-law's house that day that she explained they're a cult that prey on tourists. Always go with your gut feeling when traveling lol, better safe than sorry.",

We said no thank you bye.\n\nConsidering their culture and how we were approached, it was clearly not a genuine conversation. It just felt like a poor advertising attempt for getting tourists to rent some clothing. I think it happened twice or three times in similar ways. Not sure if this was the same as the blog was describing though.",

A friend of mine was approached so often she started pretending she didn't speak English (she's fluent in Spanish), and occasionally I do it in French. My Korean friends have advised me otherwise to be very abrupt and just keep walking or be kinda rude.

I went with them a few weeks ago and did the 45-minute ritual in Hanbok with a French girl and 3 Koreans, ate some fruits afterwards, and talked about random shit with that one Korean dude. He was actually super nice and funny and didn't push any beliefs or whatever onto me, we didn't even talk about religion or whatever. we had really good conversations. he just explained some Chinese characters and the Buddhist(?) ritual. it was in some communal center and he told me that they are a student group who does this voluntarily to share the Korean culture? \n\nFor me it was a really nice experience and I gave him like 4000 KRW or something? covered the costs of the fruits hahaha. But how do they make money with that? like with getting there etc I was with them for probably at least 2 h. 4000 KRW in 2 h for two and a half people is not really much and I don't think they get more from other tourists. even 10K is not much. we were taking the metro etc so that didn't even covered these costs. \n\nI had described the ritual to a Korean friend of mine and it actually was something traditional Korean, she knew about it. im so confused now. you guys ruined my memory :D i thought I was really lucky and appreciated the group's effort lol. im so sad that apparently it was just a scam or whatever and not altruism, I felt special :( :D",

But this is as good a time as ever to bring up the \"friendly locals\" scam.  \n\nI've seen it all over the world.  Basically the friendly locals strike up a conversation, then invite you out for a beverage.  They take you to a place they're in cahoots with.  When the bill comes it is outrageous, and they expect you to pay it.  \n\nThe one and only time I fell for this, many years ago in Havana, I told them to fuck off.  They tried to keep me from leaving the premises, but I just pushed them aside and left.  Once I was on the street, they weren't going to mess with me.  \n\nThis worked out for me in a country with very little violent crime and few to no guns; I'd tread carefully in places where your safety isn't quite so assured.  Just don't fall for it to begin with!  I've had people try it on me many many times in many many places since then.  I just laugh at them now, or sometimes fuck with them, such as telling them that my five (pretend) friends would also love to meet them and will be joining us.  See how they run!",

I'm a solo female traveler so at some point I was extremely scared for my safety, but fortunately they are only looking for quick and easy money. I declined to donate and we parted ways (after a long 2-hour ritual).\n\nBottom line is, they aren't dangerous they are just annoying. Next time just tell them you're not interested and walk away. Yes, there will be a next time. On my second trip to Seoul I was stopped by at least 3 more duos. Help other foreigners, if you ever see it happening again!!",

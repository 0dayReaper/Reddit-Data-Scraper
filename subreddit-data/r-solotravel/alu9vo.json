So I spent a week learning how to use Adobe inDesign, then spent way too long making these. \n\nWas just supposed to be a photo book at first, but turned into more of a diary type thing. Im really happy with them though!! Im hoping to add one or two new ones every year, and keep them forever. One day I can pass them down to my cats and inspire them to go off on journeys of their own! \n\nOban was the first (2 days), then Barcelona (6 days), then London/USA/China (115 days, mild escalation), then Portland a few months back (12 days). Oban and Barcelona are completely solo, London/USA/China is mostly solo, and Portland I was visiting a friend, so no solo travel there. \n\nIf you wish you can read them here: (works best on a desktop/laptop)\n\n[Oban](https://indd.adobe.com/view/2e1d9106-742b-4f21-acca-ae9a3df692d3)\n\n[Barcelona](https://indd.adobe.com/view/49182f4c-87c8-48a1-b3a6-ea3e94f9fe98)\n\n[London/USA/China/Hong Kong](https://indd.adobe.com/view/e83a1997-21a0-468a-9996-4230acc1b2fc)\n\n[Portland](https://indd.adobe.com/view/b3af70d1-da78-4d19-91e2-6253a3640eaa)\n",

That way, the next adventure you go to, you still have a source of income!  \n\n\nThe push further with the idea, you could make a site that sells custom large prints, calendars, mugs, etc. I am not familiar with any sites that are best for photos so I can't help there, it's more food for thought.  \n\n\nAnother random idea could be to send a copy of these books to the city council of each city and see if they would buy bigger prints! Tug on those emotional chains for a while and let the cha-ching fall straight into your pocket!!!!!!!  \n\n\nI've been learning ways to monetize art for long term profit and photographers have a lot of content that doesn't get used. That is my goal once I get a new set of camera equipment :)  \n\n\nHope you enjoy the brain food!",

I mean, I doubt they'll still know what everything is when they check out their books 50 years from now... Text is so useful! Also when showing the books to other people..\n\nAnyway, what I wanted to ask: your maps. You seem to make custom maps of your journeys (or have them custom made?). How do you do it? So far, I've not been able to do better than just copy/paste a screenshot I take from GoogleMaps.. But you make them exactly the way I'd love to so I'm curious.  \n",

Cannon Beach is also really nice.

            "comment": "This is not going to be a fun transfer for you, so I apologize in advance. That said, you should have more than enough time in the end.\n\nOption one is to take a taxi or an Uber between the airports, which will probably be between $100 and $200 and will take roughly an hour. The danger is that this may be during rush-hour when people are commuting home from manhattan, which might create traffic. \n\nOption two is to leave JFK, take the AirTrain which connects to the subway A line, take the subway to Penn Station in Manhattan, then take the New Jersey transit  (Trenton line) to Newark. This option will cost roughly $25 in total, although you do need three separate tickets, and should take roughly 2 hours as long as you manage the transfers. Good luck!\n\nEDIT: I just realized your flights might be in the morning rather than the afternoon/evening. If that\u2019s the case I highly recommend you take a car even though it will be costly because the trains run very inconsistently before ~6AM.",

According to google maps, it is possible at that time.",

            "comment": "Unfortunately you are arriving at a really horrible time to make that transfer. Very honestly, if you can afford it just take an Uber, it will save you a LOT of headache. At that insane hour in the morning, the JFK airtrain will be running with reduced service, also it depends on what JFK terminal you land at because currently the airtrain is not serving terminal 1 which is a whole another annoyance. \n\nEven if you get a timely airtrain, absolutely DO NOT take it to the A train at that time in the morning. The A train station that connects to JFK is sketchy at the best of times and I would absolutely avoid you against being there solo at odd hours of the morning. \n\nSo your other option is to connect to the E train or the LIRR at Jamaica station. The LIRR is usually quicker to Penn Station where you will transfer to the NJ transit to head to Newark but again I am not sure what the schedule is like early in the morning and would imagine the trains are infrequent until the morning rush starts. Same thing once you get to Penn Station with the NJ transit because you'll be going in the opposite direction of the morning rush so I don't know how frequent the trains are. \n\nEven if every train in this scenario works out seamlessly by some magical coincidence, once you get to Newark Liberty station on the NJ transit, you'll have to wait there for an Airtrain to take you to the Long term parking station and then WAIT AGAIN for another Airtrain to take you to the Terminals. I've gone to Newark 3 times in the past month and each time the wait just between these 2 Airtrains at reasonable hours of the morning and afternoon have been 20 mins+\n\nSo ultimately I will say that although it is doable to transfer using public transport, ESPECIALLY since you are landing at 3 in the morning and have your connection at 8:45 I would just take an Uber or Taxi and save yourself the mental anguish.",

Trains\u2026.ugh\u2026the problem is, you need to catch the right NJ Trains one; so airtrain to Jamaica station for LIRR to Penn should not take more than 35-40 mins, but then you need to catch the right NJ train to Newark Airport Station and while the ride would only be say 25-30 minutes, you might have to wait for the train. And then EWR airtrain, but that\u2019s fast; so I\u2019d say\u2026.plan at least 1.30 or 1.45 MINIMUM\u2026probably more.",

On google maps it looks pretty similar in total time between car/train due to traffic, but the transit route should be much cheaper. From JFK you can do the following route: Airtrain from JFK to Jamaica, LIRR from Jamaica to Penn Station, NJ Transit from Penn to EWR, then Airtrain from EWR to Terminal C. \n\nI\u2019ve only been living here for a year so that\u2019s how I\u2019d approach it, but we\u2019ll see what others have to say. The Uber might be worth the price just because there are less variables involved such as waiting on train departures.",

You have roughly 3 hours, easily more to do your transfer.\n\nTake the AirTrain (Red) to Jamaica station. Then Long Island Railroad to Penn Station. Then NJTransit (Red towards Trenton or blue towards Long Branch) to Newark Airport station. At best it would take around 1 hour 20 minutes, on average maybe 1 hour 40. Shouldn't take longer than 2 hours. I've done this many times (not the airport transfer, but I lived in NJ and took the train home from JFK).\n\nYou can also take a car like other folks are saying but honestly it's really expensive and still subject to traffic. Maybe if you're rich and it doesn't matter to you. I think the train system is very easy to figure out, very efficient, and affordable. If you're from London, since you said you're going to the UK, I think the transfer is a lot easier than say LHR to Gatwick or worse, LHR to Stansted \ud83e\udd2e\n\nFeel free to ask for help along the way there will be many uniformed personnel!",

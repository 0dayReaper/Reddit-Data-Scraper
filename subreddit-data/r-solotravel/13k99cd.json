Is this something commonly experienced?",

It\u2019s weird to come home after having the adventure of a lifetime and trying to fit back into whatever life was before the trip. \n\nI can only speak from my experience, but I am missing people and traveling so much, so it seems like a pretty common feeling.",

In a way you kind of have to mourn the end of a great journey.\n\nAfter the mourning, you recognize how incredibly moved you were by such an awesome set of experiences and then you find yourself grateful that those types of experiences are at our finger tips.\n\nStart saving for the next trip!",

I\u2019ve full on cried on planes not wanting to come home from Barcelona, Lisbon, Paris and a few others\u2026.. looked up jobs and house-prices, wanted to shift my whole life and move. \n\nThe feeling is normal and akin to the end of a honeymoon, but you\u2019ll be ok in a week or two. If not, maybe living abroad is something you could aspire towards. However it\u2019s very common to romanticise our amazing experiences abroad when we feel free and fun and away from real life.",

Not super fun but normal.\n\nEspecially with someone who had(has?) abandonment issues, every time I have to go home on a trip where I felt like I met some really amazing people, I get sad. Not so much as before when I first started, but I still reminisce fondly.\n\nSo I\u2019ve been learning to take pictures more with great people I\u2019ve met and look back on them sometimes, and also sometimes when planning my next travels I see if they\u2019re on the same way or live somewhere along the route.\n\nI\u2019ve re met multiple people I\u2019ve met on my travels, and will do so again on my short Europe trip this summer!",

            "comment": "I've described it as the same feeling as when you leave summer camp (if that was ever part of your childhood experience). You've had intense emotional experiences shared with other people, and that makes for a sort of short-cut intimacy. It improves over time, especially if you can integrate the good back into your home life, or your next destination.   \n\n\nI think every traveler comes to their own sort of philosophy on how to handle the transitory nature of these connections. I've settled on being open to reconnecting, but not investing large amounts of time or energy to maintaining the relationships after I leave. Naturally you reach out a bit sometimes at first, share some photos or jokes, and then it tapers off. I have a transitory lifestyle even in my home environment though, so I think it's taught me that you really can pick up where you left off, in the important ways.",

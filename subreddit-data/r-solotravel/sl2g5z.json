    "postText": "I\u2019m a solo female traveler and fortunate to have traveled to many countries.  This was my first trip to Turkey/Middle East.  Because I frequently travel alone, I\u2019m vigilant about my surroundings and try not to put myself in compromising situations.  But as a human, we all make mistakes and at times let our guard down.\n\nI was at a cafe alone sipping coffee when a mixed group of French nationals sat at the table next to me and starting chatting me up.  We had an enjoyable conversation and as I was leaving one of the men in the group mentioned he didn\u2019t want to go on a tour with his friends the next day and asked me if I was free for lunch.  We agreed to meet back at the cafe at 1pm the following day.\n\nAfter meeting at the cafe the next day, we walked across the street to a restaurant and had a pleasant lunch.  During lunch he insisted on ordering two glasses of white wine to enjoy with our meal.  The waiter brought the wine to our table and nothing seemed unusual.  I know better than to leave drinks unattended so I never left the table, it was ONE glass of white wine and since the waiter brought the wine to table I thought nothing of it.\n\nBy the end of the meal I started feeling more drunk than expected from a single glass but chalked it up to elevation and not having drank any alcohol in a while.  As we left the restaurant, my impairment significantly increased, I was confused and had trouble walking.  He offered to walk me to my hotel.  My judgement was already impaired and getting worse by the minute.  I agreed to have him help me get back to my hotel.  Once we arrived I unlocked the door and went straight to bathroom as I was now nauseous and started vomiting.  He must have followed me into my room, proceeded to go through my luggage, and stole my credit cards.\n\nWhen I came out of the bathroom I noticed my stuff was strewn about and immediately knew I was drugged and robbed.  \n\nWhatever I was drugged with caused my pupils to DILATE so in addition to be significantly impaired, I was unable to read anything.  I tried to call my bank but it was impossible as I literally couldn\u2019t read anything.  Given my impaired state, I also didn\u2019t think about asking hotel to help.  Impairment and dilation subsided enough about five hours later for me to contact banks but by that time thousands of dollars had been charged.\n\nAll I can think is the waiter was involved.  I keep going over all the events I can remember trying to determine what I could have done differently.  Never did I think I would be drugged and robbed in the middle of the afternoon!\n\nRegardless, I\u2019m trying to re-frame this experience as it could have been MUCH worse.  First and foremost, thankfully I was not physically assaulted.  My passport and phone were on my person and not stolen.  The main result is inconvenience of canceling accounts and hopefully getting fraudulent charges refunded.  \n\nThis was a recent event so I\u2019m still working through it but am confident there will be helpful lessons learned as I continue my travels.\n\nStay safe in this unpredictable world!!\n\nEdit 1:  Update - First, words cannot express the gratitude I feel towards this community for your kindness and support.  I really didn\u2019t know what to expect when I posted as I\u2019m not a frequent contributor to Reddit.  But the outpouring of advice and encouragement reminded me of the goodness in humanity.  This community helped me see some of the lessons to be learned from this experience as well as strengthened my resolve to continue exploring our world. \n\nI do want to make a statement to those who question traveling to Turkey or Middle East.  I spent a month in Istanbul and met many kind, wonderful Turkish citizens.  There are bad actors in EVERY country.  Generalizations can be dangerous.  WE ARE ALL HUMANS FIRST and we have NO control over which country we are born into.  The ability to travel is a privilege and those of us who have it should aim for being responsible tourists.\n\nTo the Turkish citizens who may read this, please know I have no negative feelings towards your country and my apologies for not fully thinking through the unintended consequences of my post.\n\nThankfully my PCR test was negative, I flew out of Cappadocia region this morning and am currently awaiting my flight this afternoon to Germany.  I feel like I\u2019m still in a very heightened state of alertness/awareness, am exhausted/stressed, so looking forward to resting and continuing to reflect on all that transpired past 48 hours.",

I've had friends order a drink from a regular bartender or server and then wake up somewhere random with someone else. These friends never let their drink go or looked away from the drink the entire time. Unfortunately, scammers/criminals are becoming more horribly creative with their techniques. \n\nThat being said, I'm glad that your body is safe and although you will be shaken up for a bit, do not think you did anything wrong. This sub always gives advice on how to meet other travelers to hang out organically and it sounds like you did just that...but these people were criminals and that isn't your fault. I hope you get the stolen money back and that the rest of your travels are safe and twice the fun. Thank you for sharing with us.",

Because you got a lesson that you can share with others and maybe it will help others.\n\nI really hope you are not beating yourself up too much.   Honestly it does NOT sound like you did anything stupid.\n\nI did one time.  I was flying into Heathrow but needed to get to Gatwick.  Our plane was really, really late arriving and therefore I missed the transport between the two airports and there were no more that evening.   \n\nThis guy told me he worked for BA and that he was taking a bunch of the BA employees over to Gatwick that has also missed the shuttle bus and offered to also take me.\n\nBefore I know it I am following this stranger into a dark parking garage and into his car.   A few minutes later I finally got my head on straight and totally freaked out and ordered him to stop the car NOW and let me out.  We were actually still in the parking garage and about to drive out on the road.  There was no one in the car but me and the stranger.  No  BA employees.\n\nWhich he did.   He did it right away without protest.  I think he could see I was on edge with realizing what I did.  I really to this day have no idea what this was about.   It could honestly been he was just a nice guy.  Or more likely would have shaked me down for a big fee to take me..   But I do know you NEVER do what I did.\n\nI think back now and wonder what the F*** was I thinking?   Why on earth would I ever do something like this?\n\nBA - British Airways.     I also flipped and too lazy to edit.  We flew into Gatwick and I needed to get to Heathrow.",

I hadn\u2019t really realised until now. \n\nI go to the extreme of not really getting to know anyone which I\u2019m sure some people would see as taking the fun out of solo travelling. But I\u2019m quite paranoid. Also I\u2019m older so not doing the hostel type travelling that is more common with people in their 20s. I stay in hotels and my solo travel is more about sight seeing than say the backpacker type travel which can be very social. Not that that protects me so much as easy to be scammed at all the typical tourist traps. But I purposeful avoid what some might consider having a more \u2018authentic\u2019 local experience if it puts me alone in a quieter area at night. Going to some cool underground bar for drinks  I keep for when I travel with friends (of course groups can be targeted too but I at least feel a bit safer with others travelling with me). \n\nI also don\u2019t go out so much in the evenings when travelling alone (often will eat in my hotel restaurant/bar for dinner and go out for lunch). Maybe that sounds boring to people but I\u2019m not a very savvy person if that makes sense - I just don\u2019t trust myself to not get in trouble. \n\nIf I do go out after dark I always take licensed taxis - no public transport like buses late in the evening (say 8pm onwards) unless it\u2019s a metro in a busy city that I\u2019m familiar with and lots of people around.\n\nI chat with people I encounter but never arrange to meet anyone. Which is a real shame I wish I wasn\u2019t so closed off. OP did everything right so when I read stuff like that it brings my walls up even more. \n\nI also sometimes do stupid things . For example I stayed in a bungalow facing right on a beach recently. I could see a beach restaurant about 5mins walk away that looked awesome. Before that were other hotels so no people just buildings and it was a dark unlit beach so the restaurant stood out with all the light. So I walked in the dark alone on the empty beach to the restaurant. I could have been snatched and assaulted so easily - it just takes a moment for that to happen. But I still did jt. \n\nSo it can be annoying as a woman to always be on guard and sometimes you naturally let your guard down just because you want to live and say yes to things. So whatever \u2018rules\u2019 I mentioned above I sometimes break just because that\u2019s what happens in life. \n\nSo it\u2019s great to read the story from OP as a reminder to be as vigilant as possible but if something happens that\u2019s life unfortunately. Only way to take no risks is to not leave the house.",

That French dude is almost definitely not in that town at the moment, he'll be gone from there for a few days or week at least, also depending if waiter-matey was involved or not.  They deliberately don't take yr passport or phone, so that you can GO AWAY.  Plus, too many phones have tracking, it's dumb of them to risk take a phone.    I don't fault your decision at the time to return to hotel with assistance of the 'nice' French dude - you weren't suspecting he was the source, fucking scum.  And good on you for writing here!!  Support, validation, commiserations.\n\nI spent many years in India, luckily usually managed to keep safe.  In '89 in Turkey nearly came to a very very bad incident  -- planned gang-rape, master-minded by an Aussie/Turkish guy who'd befriended me, whose uncle owned a tourist restaurant he'd arranged to meet me at for dinner.   I got suspicious with what they were trying to organise me into (him, with the uncle, a waiter &amp; a cook) we'd all go to a nearby nightclub, a taxi-ride away, but something was off &amp; I bailed from that scene so fast, I was so lucky, umm it was Antalya.  I got chills up my spine later on &amp; felt sick, realised he'd successfully done that scam at least a few times already.  Date-rape gang-rape scam.  Anyways,\n\nFirstly, if you had reported it to police, idk exactly about Turkey, but in many countries, if/when one is involved in certain types of police-involved incidents, then one may not leave the country, at least not without a great deal of hassle.  Good call not to report to local cops.\n\nSecondly, any kinds of reports involving 'drugs', can make it very messy indeed.  Even when one has been involuntarily unknowingly drugged, it can throw shade - 'oh, you were with a person you just met &amp; took drugs, took too much &amp; they robbed you, or maybe you just lost yr stuff?' type of confused bollocks, I've heard of many cases like this.\n\nIdk but, I think if I suspected I might have been drugged, I'd IMMEDIATELY stick my fingers down my throat &amp; throw everything up.  Did so a few times in India upon first niggling signs of suspected food-poisoning.  Works pretty good for that - makes it much less worse, as proven by friends who'd ordered the same dish got food poisoning really bad but I suffered much less or not at all.  Of course, this very well might not work for being drugged, by the time you can feel it coming on already it might be too late, but it potentially could at least lessen somewhat, as anything still remaining in stomach will be ejected.  Like when ambulance / hospital staff pump peoples stomach.  Might not work, but I'd sure at least give it a heck of a go.\n\nThen, I think I'd immediately request / beg / demand the most likely helpful persons/ anybody to please immediately emergency call my embassy for me.  I mean, the thing is, at that point, you have no idea who drugged you or why - thieving off you is bad enough, but there are worse criminals &amp; motives &amp; outcomes than that, doesn't bear thinking of.  Best to notify some responsible trustworthy authorities (ie, my embassy) my location &amp; state &amp; *formal request for assistance* asap.  As far as I'm aware, the request for assistance has to come from the national themselves, unless the national is unconscious/comatose &amp; hospitalised, or deceased - whereupon request comes from hospital / police.  Idk, things sure can get messy.\n\nSame at the hotel - can't see?  Get hotel staff to call yr embassy &amp; put me on the line, and/or any level-headed friend anywhere in the world who has travel experience / knowledge that will be suitable to organise assistance from afar - dial them for me, put me on the line.  At least they'll be able to think clearly, help me work out / tell me the best plan of action, and if things go even wronger, they can call my nearest embassy &amp; harass them out to search &amp; rescue me.\n\nGosh, so sorry, OP, what a fucking horrible thing to happen!   Good on you well done for keeping it together, &amp; continuing with yr travel.  Get home.  It's possible you might come down with some delayed nervous / anxious / stress / trauma - reaction, on yr flight home or at home, sometimes happens.  S ok, yre safe, you'll be home. Get some friend / family over for support, but beware of telling mums / dads about this sort of thing immediately, it can freak them out.  Also beware of telling some friends, people who haven't travelled much, hi-strung drama-queen friends/family, they can just cause you further stress &amp; trauma about it, say all sorts of stupid shit.\n\nFucking asshole scammed &amp; robbed you, gggrrrrrrr.... At least he left yr passport &amp; phone, grrrr let's all KICK his fucking chicken-shit thieving ASS if we ever catch up with him!!  Put it out on every travel / backpacking / social media you can find!!!\n\nWish for you smooth travels home!   Best of luck!   Give update when you get home!  \\* hugs \\*",

When I started to feel more drunk than normal off of one glass, I was just so confused as to why that was happening, likely my judgement was already starting to get impaired.  \n\nI\u2019ve had another much more traumatic experience in my life where I was the victim of gun violence so I know all too well about \u201cun\u201djustice systems, victim blaming, and police corruption.  While that incident was in my home country, it left a bad taste when it comes to involving police.\n\nI hadn\u2019t even considered how me being drugged might get flipped on me, that is so scary to consider and would exponentially add to the trauma I\u2019m experiencing.  Know these possible outcomes are all speculation at the moment but I do try to think about consequences of actions before taking action so thank you for bringing this up.\n\nSpeaking of considering actions, I have not yet shared this with my family for some of the reasons you mentioned.  I called a good friend after it happened as she is a calming personality and world traveler so I felt safe sharing this with her.",

My original itinerary has me flying to Germany tomorrow and I ABSOLUTELY want to be on that plane.\n\nI\u2019m from North America.  \n\nMy day today was busy as I was traveling to another town and also coordinating my PCR test so I haven\u2019t contacted anyone for camera footage.\n\nI don\u2019t think the waiter was among those I met but I\u2019m not great remembering faces especially when there are many people around.",

If a scam and they know you took their pix, most likely will try to take your phone and you always want to try to keep your phone. If eating out with others try to limit restaurant choices to a few blocks from hotel so at the start of any symptoms the hotel is not too far away. Also make use of apple/google pay with credit card not in your possession. Cancelling stolen cards and waiting for replacements in a foreign country can sometimes take a while. Also buy a whistle and put it on a necklace. Noise may scare away scammers/ intruders and bring attention from others that scammers don\u2019t want.",

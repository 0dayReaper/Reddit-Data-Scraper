But now I afraid that it will be very very hard without my friends close and stuff. But I also think it's a good thing, to be away from everything that reminds me and try to have fun. So does anyone have experience with this and/or advice on this?",

I've met sooo many people  in hostels doing backpacking trips after ending a long relationship, so it's definitely a thing. Whatever you decide, wish you the best!",

Relationships ending can feel like the ending of a life chapter, so with travel you get to decide how the next chapter starts. \n\nPlus I think it\u2019s best to go solo. You give yourself so much time to think, but not enough to reminisce and slip backwards. You learn a lot about yourself, especially self preservation, and most importantly you can practice meeting new people. \n\nStaying in party hostels have been my favorite part so far. Meeting people, getting blasted, telling stories, and then parting ways in a more happy, mutal way. Solo travel can help you get back into the swing of meeting people (even if its not for romance) and enjoying your own company.",

            "comment": "Been there. Done that. The post-breakup, soul searching travel, that is. I went THROUGH it last fall/winter. I had a trip planned with the ex that was canceled due to being dumped, of course, and I decided that I still did not want to be home during that time. Instead, I took myself somewhere completely different and did it all for myself. \n\n\nA couple thoughts for you:\n1.) You say you\u2019re a few days post. You are in the immediate trauma response timeframe. While it might seem like picking up and forcing yourself down the road is the healthiest thing to do right now, I might suggest giving yourself a few weeks (or months even) to acclimate to your latest life change. Grief is normal and necessary to feel right now, and I don\u2019t know what your experience is but I had a very physical response in that period. Traveling is demanding at best and stressful at worst, and being away from your comfortable spaces and things and people might not be the healthiest immediately post. \n\n\n2.) Don\u2019t worry though\u2026with time you will start to feel different. Notice that I didn\u2019t say better? I\u2019m not trying to be negative or catastrophize. Your perception and feelings will change. You will have some distance from the situation. This is progress! I got to this point and realized it was time for me to do something just for me. I chose travel in that moment. I recognized that I was still sad (and otherwise emotional) about what I went through, but I also realized that I would feel that no matter what. Part of my rationalization was \u201cIf I\u2019m going to feel it, I can feel it anywhere!\u201d. \n\n3.) Manage your expectations of the next travel experience, whenever you do get there. New surroundings, throwing yourself into planning, meeting new people, partying, reinventing yourself to strangers, overloading your senses\u2026these are all distractions. Good ones! But still just that. It won\u2019t change or solve anything for YOU. You bring yourself with you everywhere, no matter what. \n\nAllow yourself lots of down time. Be sad in your room alone when you need to. Cry in public places when it overwhelms you (or don\u2019t\u2026maybe you\u2019re stronger than I). Prepare yourself to talk about some version of what you have experienced if you\u2019re comfortable doing so (people love to ask about what your story is and what led you to where you are\u2026you don\u2019t have to be so honest, but it\u2019s therapeutic sometimes to share simply with a stranger). \n\nHaving had an experience like this, my biggest takeaway from that travel was a glorious reminder that this world is chock full of interesting, beautiful, kind, generous individuals worthy of meeting. I didn\u2019t know that I needed to be reminded of this before I left, specifically. However, I did come home feeling relieved of the \u2018end of the world\u2019, hopeless, panicky part of me that I exited the breakup with. I no longer felt like I had met and lost the one person I was meant to be with. \n\nStay strong, friend.",

The pain doesn't go away but it gets bearable. Stop reaching out for a bit and I know it's hard when you have a meme you want to share with them on a Tuesday afternoon. The breakup will definitely affect your trip, it's up to you if it will be good or not. No one will blame you if it goes bad. I would wait a couple weeks to a month to process your emotions a bit. No use going half way across the world before processing a little bit, your emotions will come out. Locals will look at you confused \ud83e\udd23.\n\n\nI took 3 solo trips in a 9 month time frame for a 14 month relationship. 10 months in and I am JUST starting to feel like me again. Be nice to yourself and your ex (no matter how trashy they are), no one likes to look back and see their poor reactions. If your partner really was shit, let it go. Trust karma will get back to them.

To this day it's one of my favorite trips I've ever taken.  I know every trip isn't meant to be full of meaning but this was one of the few trips I've had that really felt like a life-changing experience.\n\nI went to LA and basically did all the things that I thought were so cool as a kid - the Walk of Fame, a Beverly Hills homes tour, toured the WB studio, went to a late night show taping, etc.  On the way back east I stopped in Vegas for two nights and saw Britney and went to the Billboard Music Awards! I was a kid obsessed with fame and pop culture and I was living the life my 7 year old self dreamed of! \n\nYou meet so many people along the way and that's the best part of it.  One night a movie premiere was happening outside my hotel in LA and I talked with a few girls who were frequent premiere spectators - we ended up going out to dinner after.  When I was in line for a post-show concert for Jimmy Kimmel I got talking with a girl who had just ended a long-term relationship and was taking this trip from similar reasons.  In the pit at Britney I ended up making friends with the people who stood around me and some of us still follow each other on IG like 6-7 years later.  \n\nAll this being said, I will ***never*** not recommend the post-breakup solo trip!",

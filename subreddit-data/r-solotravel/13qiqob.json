    "postText": "Hello everybody,\n\nstarting autumn I'm planing to do solo trip though the Europe. For now not much planned, just that I'll start in Lithuania, drive to Warsaw and stay there for three of weeks, then move to Belgium for another three. Afterwards the only point which I want to reach by the end of the year is Gibraltar, but it's also open for discussion. Idea is to wander a little bit with option to stay at one place for longer period of time if I feel like it.  \nSince I've remote job, most of workdays will be occupied with my work, this is why I'm planning at one place to stay for at least three weeks, so I have couple of weekends there during my stay.  \n\n\nSo far done a little local test run for my trip and enjoyed staying at hostel. Mostly I've get back just to sleep, so it's fine to share a room, also new connections made there are welcome for sure. For doing my work, I think it will be easy to find co-working spaces in bigger cities and since I don't have many meetings, working at smaller town coffee shops is quite an option.  \n\n\nOverall looking an advice on how to pre-plan itinerary, what to look out for, how to expand network, would it make sense to stay in big city center, or it's better to stay near by, and so on...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease share your experiences and any advice is welcome!",

Even taking into account that I'm going to work bigger part of the day?  \nSince idea regarding three weeks came from one of my previous trips where I was just staying for two weeks. That felt like just having off-office hours and single weekend wasn't enough.",

But road trips are amazing and allow you to see things at your own pace and find \u201chidden gems\u201d that you would miss going from central station to central station in cities. It is clearly more expensive but I like this tour. Only OP has to \u201cwatch out\u201d (not really sure how) for theft, especially in the Eastern European regions and check out any fees for crossing borders or even if any additional paperwork is needed",

Car still can be looted, but same thing can happen in my Eastern Europe country xd  \nMy main concern here regarding car is now much of the extra effort there is going to be involved regarding parking",

I wouldn\u2019t do it in places like Belgium but hey..no better way to experience the reality of a country than having your car towed and dealing with the local police lol",

Is it some kind of official event or is it just widely celebrated all across the city? What should I expect? \n\nIf you've been and have an experience to share, you're more than welcome to! Thanks in advance.",

I think there is a big official launch point over by a university somewhere, but there are also people launching lanterns all over the old city. Watch where you step because there are tiny little clay pots with candles in them lining the sidewalks.\n\nThe people were very cool and invited us to help launch some lanterns. We also stopped in every 7-11 along the way and drank lots of Riceberry (local beer which is very cool). The food is amazing too, be sure to get some Khao Soi.\n\nWe stayed in an Airbnb that was walking distance from the old city but still on a main road with bars and street food.\n\nJust learn how to say hello and thank you in Thai and you'll have a blast!\n\nCheers",

    "postText": "I\u2019m planning my first big international solo trip &amp; I would love some advice! I have found myself in the position of having easy, remote work that makes me a decent income with minimum effort, which I can pretty easily maintain while traveling. I don\u2019t need an office space or quiet anything like that. \n\nI make about 2-3k a month &amp; I have the ability to live with my mom for free for a few months whenever I need to save up some extra cash. I\u2019ve just realized solo traveling is just as cheap as paying rent &amp; with my job, why not! I already have no community and very little relationships around me regardless-so I figure I\u2019m pretty much going solo whether I\u2019m at home or abroad. \nI\u2019m going to try to keep my budget close to 2-3 k a month for most of my travels (not including my flights as most of them will be free for me), but I will be starting with 5k extra saved up every time I fly into Europe as well as when I fly into Costa Rica because I know the prices are elevated in Western Europe. The extra 5k I\u2019ll have in Costa Rica will be helping fund my Spanish immersion program &amp; scuba expenses. \n\n I do pretty well with being alone, but I\u2019m a little worried about loneliness or maybe not liking it as much as I think I\u2019m going to! Any advice for this is appreciated!\nHere is the current plan, any tips, criticism, suggestions are highly appreciated! Im a 26 year old female traveler.\nThe first leg of my trip is in the PNW where I\u2019ll be staying in airbnbs, car/tent camping &amp; staying with friends. I\u2019ll be hitting crater lake, blue pool, the Oregon coast, spokane, Seattle, Forks WA and I\u2019ll also be doing a twilight saga tour of the areas! I also have a 10 day Alaskan cruise planned during this time.\n\nThen I\u2019m off to Western Europe for 5 weeks starting in mid September! I will have an extra 6k on this trip &amp; then also my 2k a month earnings for the budget I\u2019m trying to stick with.  \n\nI\u2019ll be flying into Denmark &amp; staying for 5 nights. Next is germany where I\u2019ll be staying in Hamburg, Berlin &amp; Munich for a total of 9 nights. I will be in Munich for Oktoberfest! Next I\u2019ll be in Amsterdam for 5 nights! Next I\u2019ll take a train to Belgium where I\u2019ll be staying for five nights. Paris is next with 5 nights in the city and a sixth night at Disney Paris.\n\nLondon is the next destination where I\u2019ll be staying four nights before flying back to the states!\nIn late October I will be driving into Utah to spend the next two months staying with family for free &amp; focusing on learning to ski at Brighton ski resort every day! I\u2019ll be able to save about 5k during this time to help prepare me for the next leg of my journey!\n\nIn the beginning of January I\u2019m flying into Costa Rica for 90 days! I plan on staying at a Spanish immersion school in Samara on the beach &amp; staying there for 10 weeks to really improve my Spanish! The school has living accommodation. I also want to focus on scuba-diving a lot &amp; learning to surf!  I will know Spanish for the rest of my trip, which will definitely make things easier!\nI will then spend the last two weeks that I have in Costa Rica probably in Puerto Viejo where I\u2019ll spend one week in an all girls hostel, Selina Puerto Viejo. The last 10 days I\u2019ll be staying in a private air bnb in the same area to grab some extra privacy before I head to Colombia! I\u2019m staying in Puerto Viejo specifically for the scuba diving in the area. \n\nIn April 2024 I\u2019ll be starting the South American leg of my travels &amp; I haven\u2019t done a ton of research about these areas yet, which means I\u2019m open to any suggestions! I fly into Colombia, where I plan to stay for around two months! I have read it takes quite a while to really see &amp; immerse yourself in Colombia! Here I really want to focus on adventure, seeing everything I can &amp; learning to salsa dance! \n\nIn June 2024 I will be visiting Ecuador for two months, half of that time specifically will be spent in the Galapagos islands primarily scuba diving. I\u2019ll probably end up doing a mix of air bnbs and hostel living here. \nNext up comes Peru around the beginning of August! I want to see Manchu Picchu! I am not sure how much time I should spend in this country to really experience it, but my current thoughts are probably a month. I am super open for suggestions on what to do in this area.\nAfter Peru I will be headed to Brazil! \nIm thinking that I will probably end up in Brazil during September &amp; staying for about a month, maybe more like two months!\n\nI plan to head back to Utah sometime in October 2024 where I\u2019ll be focusing on skiing once again. I\u2019ll be staying with my mom for 3 months which will allow be to save about 8k to prepare me for the next leg on my travels. \nIn Feb 2025 I will be in the Florida Keys for 60 days really immersing myself into scuba diving &amp; staying at an Airbnb.\n\nAt the beginning on April 2025 I fly into Finland hopefully in time to see the northern lights! I will be traveling to Finland, Sweden, Norway, Ireland and Iceland for the next 90 days, I haven\u2019t planned this leg of the trip a ton. I also I plan on doing The Laugavegur Trek in June in Iceland. \n\nI know this is a lot &amp; planned way far in advance &amp; quite ambitious, but I really feel like I\u2019m committed and know what I want for the next few years. It is probably crazy to jump into solo travel with very little experience like this, but screw it! You only live once! \n\nAnother thing to note is that I do have a chronic pain condition &amp; because of that I\u2019m a huge stoner. Im a medicinal user and live in OR. I smoke a lot of weed and ideally would love to be able to smoke during all of my travels, though I know that\u2019s not going to happen and is not realistic. Plz be understanding about this as it is my intent to manage my pain not to be troublesome or disrespectful. I know I\u2019ll be able to smoke most places in Europe and Costa Rica, although any advice for doing that would be much appreciated! \n\nI\u2019m much more worried about being able to smoke in Colombia, as I\u2019ve read it can be dangerous to obtain any type of drugs here, even just thc, even though it\u2019s decriminalized. I also think I\u2019m going to stay sober in Colombia just to be respectful . No idea about the other countries in South America though! I can get by without weed, though I\u2019m in much less pain with access to it.\n I\u2019m worried about packing for central and South America. Do you really think I can live out of a backpack for 7 months? Do people really do that? I\u2019m 5\u20190 and I don\u2019t have a ton of muscle. I really want to bring my guitar to this leg of my travels, but I\u2019m not sure how realistic that is. I read overpacking can ruin trips &amp; I want to be comfortable.\n\nI\u2019m an adrenaline junkie &amp; I\u2019m down for absolutely anything! Suggestions for bucket list activities in these areas are much appreciated!\nTips for budgeting, working abroad (note I only work 2-3 hours daily), thc, packing, loneliness, scuba diving, scuba budgeting, safety as a solo female traveler, etc. would really help!\nThank you!",

If you're sleeping in weird beds every night, walking around a lot, wearing out your shoes, your pain could increase.

I heard in this sub you need a work visa if you're making your money in that place. I don't know but it's something to look into with all these different destinations.",

Just a heads up, Costa Rica is very expensive, at least as much as most European countries I've been to - particularly the beach towns like Samara. I was initially planning on settling somewhere hear to do a Spanish immersion school type thing, but am going to do that in Colombia instead to preserve my travelling funds. As far as cannabis goes here, I've been offered it many times pretty much everywhere, maybe less so in Samara than the likes of Fortuna, Manuel Antonio and Tamarindo. I've never bought any but have smoked with others and the quality seems pretty low. So if you're used to that legal American high grade then you'll probably be very disappointed.   \n\n\nIn terms of general first time solo travel advice, living out of a \\~40L backpack is fantastic and I  would highly recommend it. You can fit a lot more than you think, particularly if you're only small. I always feel sorry for people I see lugging around enormous backpacks or things with wheels. Also, it doesn't sound like you are but never plan too rigidly if you have the freedom to travel for as long as you like. Just go from place to place when you're ready with a rough idea of where you'd eventually like to end up and allow your plans to change regularly.",

I personally prefer to stay in hostels for this reason.\n\nI personally feel much more lonely at home (even among friends and family) than while traveling abroad because of how quick and easy it is to bond with other solo travelers.\n\nAs for finding weed in foreign countries, it shouldn't be too difficult. Be wise about the legality but you should definitely have no problem finding weed in hostels in Latin America. I smoked weed in basically every country that I went to in Central/South America. A large blunt wrapped in kief costs about $1.50 in Medell\u00edn, but you gotta have a local get it for you hahaha\n\nAlso look into going to Uruguay, the first country to recreationally legalize cannabis.",

I guess my advice would be to leave some open space for adjusting your plans as you go - your energy levels, priorities, and goals might be different after ~8 months of traveling than they are right now, so leaving some space to adjust is a good idea. It's common advice in the subreddit, but also leaving some room to rest and relax and recharge will also be important - it does sound like some of your planned stops are longer than others so that should help with making sure you have time to rest. Lastly it's worth looking in to all the visa requirements for your planned destinations, as well as considering making a travel medicine appointment for any recommended or required vaccinations.\n\nSee the \"Content from our Wiki\" links in the sidebar for articles with advice on some of your questions including safety, budgeting, and planning your first trip.

Basically just in your situation I'd add more time and look at other things to do in the countries as well. \nFor example for france I am majorly interested in but not going to mont saint-michel, the pyreens, Marseille + the calanques, \u00c9tratat\n\nWith an open schedule like that you could take your time with places and go to a lot of off the beaten path stuff + also just take free days and not really do anything special. But mileage would vary so it's really down to personal preference I guess",

            "comment": "Posted this on your previous post, repeat here:\n\nSounds amazing, first of all good luck with it! I can\u2019t really help with the South America side but can comment on Europe:\nI am a little concerned about your income compared to costs in some of the Europe destinations. Copenhagen and Amsterdam are crazy expensive (think NYC prices), so you\u2019d be lucky to just get accommodation for $3k a month. Netherlands is close to banning all short term rentals so you\u2019d need to get a hostel (can be $100 / night in Amsterdam) or campsite. The rest of nordics are also pretty expensive. \n\nRegarding weed, you\u2019re totally fine in Belgium, Netherlands(can legally buy it here), Germany (might be fully legal by the time you get there), DK. Smoke in a park or somewhere not in full public and you\u2019ll have no trouble. \nIn France and U.K. it\u2019s illegal but relatively available, go to any music bar in the evening and ask people who look like regulars, they\u2019ll have some or be able to give you a phone number of someone who does. If you\u2019re secretive about it and don\u2019t carry large amounts, you\u2019ll be ok, it is technically a prison-worthy offence in both countries but you\u2019d probably just get a fine or a warning depending on how much you have on you.\nIn the other Nordics (especially Sweden) it\u2019s illegal and significantly less tolerated than in FR/UK. It\u2019s not gonna come to you, need to really ask around in the right places to find it. The fines for even minor possession can be significant here. In Sweden it could be approx. 3 months of your income, Iceland $500+ etc.\nGood luck!",

If you head over to heronebag you can find a lot of inspiration on travelling light or get input on your packing plans.\n\nI haven't done anything this extensive, but I also had some ideas on potential homesickness prep, things that have helped me were bringing a small childhood stuffed animal, pics in my phone and videocalls with family, and cooking 'home' foods on occasion. And have you considered a ukulele rather than a guitar? My Flight travel uke has a decent sound, is pretty, sturdy and easy to travel with (just loosen the strings for a flight and retune after) It is very easy to learn especially when you already play the guitar, and for me another way to prevent homesickness, but also turned out to be a great way to connect.",

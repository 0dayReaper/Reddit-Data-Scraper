You could easily fill two days there checking out the Jesuit Ruins, San Cosme dunes, the beach, it has a great plaza and nice bars/breweries as well. You can then take the train across the border to Posadas and catch a cheap flight to Buenos Aires from the airport there. That's what I would do with your timeframe.",

I was actually on the fence with Encarnation but I though it would be a hassle to get to Bs As, didn\u2019 consider crossing the border for a flight. Encarnacion definitely seems to be the more interesting destination. Is it relatively easy to get to the Posadas airport from Encarnacion? And are there frequent buses from CDE to Encarnacion?",

Once in Encarn you can either take a train, bus, or taxi across the bridge to Posadas. You will have to clear customs I'm pretty sure. Posadas is a nice city, the capital of Misiones province, with a really nice costanera along the river, good pizza, and of course - Freddo Ice Cream. The airport is about a 20 minute taxi from the city center and should not be too expensive. There are two or three flights to Buenos Aires daily I believe.",

Barely any people in the streets, few restaurants, few things to see and do (really the Jesuit ruins are it, and not amazing). I was bored out of my mind after a couple days\n\nAsuncion on the other hand is an incredible modern'ish city, I didn't want to leave. You have a variety of neighbourhoods, interesting people, good restaurants, it's lively.",

I was living near Asunci\u00f3n when I visited Encarnaci\u00f3n and really just enjoyed the tranquility of the main plaza, that awesome sandwich shop there, and the beach was pretty chill to hang out at, drink terer\u00e9, etc. Asunci\u00f3n is definitely awesome, vibrant city, costanera, good restaurants and awesome nightlife.",

With that said, personally, I\u2019d scrap Uruguay and add on to other areas in Chile and Argentina. I\u2019d pick Atacama over Valparaiso and Salta area over Iguazu.\n\nBuenos Aires is one of my favorites cities and I\u2019ve spent cumulatively probably about a year there, but for a visit 4 days would be good, I\u2019d think.  I also think S\u00e3o Paulo is more 3 days than 4 days.",

            "comment": "I've been to almost all of those places in the past year, most of the time travelling by bus. Just some random thoughts\n\n\\- I would personally skip Uruguay completely and add some destinations in Argentina. Uruguay really is as dull and boring as everyone on the internet says it is. \n\n\\- Cordoba is ok, but there's nothing amazing there. It's kind of a much smaller and scaled down Buenos Aires. I wouldn't worry about skipping it.\n\n\\- Add in Salta and Bariloche if you can figure out a route, both destinations are definitely worth it. I did Asuncion-Salta-Mendoza-Bariloche by bus and then flew Bariloche-Cordoba and then bus to Buenos Aires. The bus rides are long and mostly boring, but they were mostly overnight. Internal Argentina flights are pretty cheap and can be purchased at the blue dollar rate.\n\n\\- I would cut down Chile significantly. Santiago is dirty (not in a fun way either) and uninteresting. Same goes for Valparaiso though you do get some good views on the hillsides. Vina Del Mar has nothing to offer. If anything, I would just do a daytrip to Valparaiso. It's maybe a 1.5hr bus ride from Santiago.",

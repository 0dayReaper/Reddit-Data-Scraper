    "postText": "Am I the only one who does not like travel youtubers at all?\n\n1) Their thumbnails and titles have all become a clich\u00e9. It's all the same. \"Is this Saudi Arabia????\", \"is this Latvia?\", \"I did not expect this!!!\". \"SHOCKING first experience!\", \"our first time in Brunei (we did not like it)\", etc etc. What did you expect? And why should we care about what you expected? Plus the thumbnail is almost always a face with the mouth open.\n\n2) \"This is my 70th country!\" Who cares? This is the 150th city I have visited, why not the 28th museum or zoo?\n\n3) 75% of the video is the vlogger brushing her/his teeth, or saying \"wooow\" or \"waa that is the most beautiful beach ever!! Also mandatory \"wooow the locals here are so friendly guys!!!\"\n\n4) Many of them have a drone shot that always comes with a modern millennial music. When I travel to a place, that is not the view that I will see, so I am not interested.\n\n5) Another variety is those who just regurgitates whatever they just read or heard in 5 to 10 minutes. Come on, if I want to know about the history of the place, I will read an encyclopaedia, not listen to some obscure vloggers. Plus I like how some of them only spent like 5 days in the country, and then acted like they are the authority for information concerning that country.\n\n6) There are also vloggers who are conventionally attractive, so they always pose and show their body. When the vlogger is a handsome young man, he often uses his attractive girlfriend in bikini as a clickbait.\n\n7) Not to mention that many of them seem to be fake and are outright \"wannabes\". Apparently some of them would sell courses for hundreds of dollars so that \"you guys can have a life of travel like me!!\", \"day one or one day, you decide!!\"",

Or they've totally sold out to sponsorships. They're obnoxious as hell. The others I despise are those that do stupid shit or go to places they shouldn't just to get views. \n\nThere are also a lot of YouTubers that I like that have a lot of quality content where it's not all about 'look at me and my amazing travel life.' Gabriel Traveler is the YouTuber I watch that doesn't have all the pretentious crap you described. He's one of the YouTube blogger OGs, travels to interesting places, no gimmicky drone shots, and films himself traveling like a normal person/semi-budget backpacker would. Others I like are Indie Traveler, Adventures of A+K, Joel Friend, and Kraig Adams. They've all been useful for me in my trip planning or for gathering travel ideas.",

His videos aren\u2019t meant for any hardcore traveler though and that\u2019s quite obvious. The same goes for most travel \u201cvloggers\u201d or whatever u wanna call tjem, their audience is people who have a want to travel but don\u2019t actually pull the trigger and go somewhere besides western europe, it\u2019s an easy way of digesting content and learning something new without actually reading. Everyone I know who has a decent amount of knowledge about the world or has travelled alone to some more obscure places and knew who Drew Binsky was didn\u2019t like him lol.   \n  \nI like others more, or at least used to before I went on my first trip. During covid I watched a decent amount of bald and bankrupt as I found the places he went to and the length of his videos nice too, showing a lot of some countries I\u2019m not going to go to for a long time with an interesting hidtory. IMO that\u2019s better than reading about the country.  \n  \nNow I don\u2019t watch any of them. But I think that\u2019s gonna be a common point of view here. I highly doubt self proclaimed solo travelers who put enough effort to follow the Reddit channel are watching travel videos for inspiration, at least not mainstream ones.",

They are making entertainment content. \n\nYou need clickbait thumbnails and titles just to get someone to click on the video otherwise your click-through-rate is low and nobody watches the video.\n\nThat's the nature of the platform.\n\nAnd I will also say that theres nothing wrong if someone goes to the touristy stuff and engages with the things you can find on a brochure. People are perfectly allowed to do that.\n\nAnd yes, visiting a lot of countries is something most people will never do. To us it may seem like \"wow look at this dude bragging about visiting countries\" but most people barely even leave their own city/town.\n\nBeing prouud of having visited 70+ counteies or such is perfectly allowed. If a youtuber is sharing their experiences with traveling they are allowed to do so as they wish.\n\nIf you rather have different content on youtube have you considered starting your own channel? Part of what makes successful channels is having a unique approach, so I would encourage you to go for it and try if you have a different style and personalize it to you.",

    "postText": "English is not my first language. \n\nI am French and a huge solo traveller. Always had good to EXCELLENT experience. I never had one bad to be honest.\n\nI arrived in Lisbon 3 days ago and I must say...I am very disappointed. \n\nI did 2 tours: one in Sintra and one in Lisboa (3:30 for the last one). In both cases, they didn't have much to say. \n\nSintra, half of the tour was about how green it was and 3 anedoctes.\n\nThe Palace was beautiful I must admit. That was the good thing. \n\nThe second one was a pro, I mean, he was putting energy, jokes, we stopped for tasting. But there was not content, no monuments. \n\nIt was called \"the essential of Lisboa\" so I was a bit surprised as he had nothing to say. \n\nI even asked him a question about Napoleon and Portugal. He cut me, turned around to start walking and and was saying \"very good question but we are going to talk about it later, that's not the moment\". He seemed pissed and never mentioned it again.\n\nI have experienced that cold tone in Lisbon since I am here. \n\n\nAfter the second tour, our guide left us downtown and there was that festive food market. It was super cute (a lot of decorations!), Music... so I was filming. \n\nTwo women of 2 different booth started to fight. A guy from one of the member family put out a gun and shoot in the air 2 times. One meter from me. I ran away. \n\nWhen I wanted to go back, 2 women came to me yelling \"you FILMED!!!\" And forced me to gave my phone. Went through my phone to delete what they needed to.\n\nYep, that didn't help. The police arrived shortly after. \n\nI don't count the waitresses who REFUSE to even look at  me when they are loudly laughing with other clients. \n\nI believe they don't speak English but a smile and not doing \"pfffff\" just next to me at least ...\n\nI sat in one restaurant, was waiting for the waitress to come for a long moment. She didn't. So I came to her, said hello, and told her I would go to toilets while she decides it was time to come. \n\nShe said \"no. Order first\".\n\nI stayed cause it was hella crowded everywhere. \n\nShe then apologized several times saying people tend to use the bathroom and never order. \n\nIn restaurants, AFTER I pay, people relax. \n\nPeople being PISSED when I ask for a lighter or my way (I ask the second one in Portuguese and say thank you). \n\nWhen I want to enter a building, two times, someone closed the door quick before I enter it cause they didn't want to let me in. \n\nIts exactly like you are suspect until they decide you are not. \n\nThat's tiring. \n\nWay better with young people. Like teenagers...super cool. \n\nI am heading to Albufeira but then I am going back to Lisbon after.\n\nHow to experience the best out of it? I really feel like there is a potential I am missing. \n\nI also feel like the fact I am black is playing a lot. \n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: I must say I am surprised by the lovely comments and tips. I have tried to reply to everyone and I have well noted everything you have said. I still have 2/3 days in Lisbon and I think I will go back there like it's the first time and give it another chance and do better with all the tips you gave me. \n\nI am now in Albufeira, it is not crowded at all. Its not crazy (I think it's a bit early in the season). Beach is not crowded also and my host was the nicest guy I have met since I have arrived in Portugal. \n\nAnd to reply to people, when the women came to me, i was scared as fuck. I was shacking when they asked for my phone as the guy was just behind me. I was terrified. Now, I feel more humiliated letting anonymous people go through my phone, my pics, my personal space (there were almost touching me). I am more mad at me for just...you know, allowing that even if I know I did the best thing. \n\nJust felt like \"wow...I could beat them but the guy is behind me with a gun\".",

I stayed in the hotel Britannia and the eurostars garden location.  The Britana was nicer of the two.  also went to a restaurant with the odd name of sexy meat that I could recommend.  I think there's one in abufeira too. check out that and the Brazilian restaurants.  Near abufeira the seven hanging gardens hike is very scenic. You can actually rent a kayak and go into the caves on the seashore.",

They get paid very low wages and often are overworked, based on people I\u2019ve talked to working the service industry in Porto and Lisbon. \n\nOne thing that I noticed while there is the way older people treat Brazilians. There are tensions with the influx of Brazilians and I\u2019ve heard and seen some  pretty negative reactions to them. This is especially true if you are a woman and attractive. There are preconceived ideas about \u201cBrasileiras\u201d. So if you look Brazilian, which is very diverse actually, that may garner some unwanted attention. Just FYI.

Overall the sense I got was that there are a lot of unwelcomed changes to Portugal and increased tourism is one of them. It\u2019s a double edged sword. The Algarve is used to lots of tourism so perhaps it\u2019ll be more relaxed and welcoming. I think you will have a blast! \n\nBy the way, I love France! The women are so chic.

The best thing you can do is research the restaurants you are going to and see if anything is said about hospitality. Avoid places that seem super busy, especially in a high tourist area. \n\nThe gun thing is really not the norm, so I don\u2019t think you will experience anything like that again. Try not to let it tarnish your experience. Portugal is wonderful but of course you will run into the occasional a-hole. Hopefully you have more experiences with people more like you for the remainder of your trip. \ud83d\ude42",

Shooting and stuff like that...I m 50 and that's news to me, and probably news in tv stations also. Not usual, at all. About asking about Napoleon....If I was German I wouldn't ask about Hitler in Paris...but that's my common sense. Lisbon is overcrowded with tourists and that's probably one reason why people are losing their cool. I felt the same in Rome but I could see that Rome it's much more than the coliseum. Sintra it's a fairy tale with two Palaces, a Castel and several amazing Manors. Lisbon aka Olissipo is older than Rome or Paris and one of the oldest cities in the world, so...there is lots of history and monuments. But I understand that you just got the \"Lisbon for tourists\" pack. If you want the tourist friendly expirience go to Algarve and Albufeira for sure....but that's not Portugal, its like Venezia....not for Italians and Lisbon is going the same way. And I personally don't think that had to do with skin color. Locals hate tourists in general... doesn't matter the colour. Good luck",

The gun thing is not usual, that definetly was unluck playing its part, but regarding bartenders and the question about napoleon, its most because you are a french foreigner if I had to say. Portuguese dont really love French people, even more if you are of color, then they think you are some robber or somthing. Id say stick to yyounger people, they are way less xenophobic or racist, and way more up to talk. Only prob is its gonna be hard to find a Cafe with young people mostly, but I hope you managw to enjoy the remaining of portugal. Also should say, this is also a lisbon thinh sincw pretty much alot of lisbon population has the \"capital\" syndrom, where they think they are above everyone else since they are the capital of portugal",

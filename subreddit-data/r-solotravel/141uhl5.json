Work on myself a bit, hit the gym, healthier food and some socialisation.\n\nBreak the routine I'm stuck in.\n\nFeel I never got into that post COVID mentality with permanent work from home.\n\nConsidering going somewhere for a while and working on the weekdays, and maybe going to some hostels on the weekend?\n\nDon't have enough holidays to take like a month off hence, and need them for later in the year. working at least some of the weekdays. My work won't know the difference as it's remote and I can do the necessary meeting and set my own time.\n\nAnyone have a similar experience?\n\nI'm specifically looking to hear from people who have taken a \"reset\" break.\n\nWhere they needed to be in a different location than they we're currently in.\n\nNot for sightseeing, but as a mental reset when they were burntout.\n\nI'm also interested to hear of people who did it while maintaining their work. People who can work remotely. Though this is not a limitation.\n\nThirdly interested in people who have used that time to work on themselves mentally physically and socially.\n\nIm looking to find a place somewhere warm, perhaps Spain Italy Greece etc. For a few weeks to reset my habits, incorporate daily fitness into my life and in the evenings or weekends find some socialisation.\n\nHopefully while maintaining my job.\n\nWhat I want to hear is about anything who did something similar even if not quite the same as I described it.\n\nDuring Covid I believe a lot of people did. Perhaps you did?",

I had gained weight and mental instability during my relationship so when back on my own I was an over weight mess and super codependent. I went to Alaska to work and try to work on myself and separate from my ex, but we chatted everyday and she even came to see me. It didn\u2019t work out staying friends and just messed me up more. I cut all contact with her and our mutual friends and went to New Orleans where I ended up relapsing with alcohol and almost hard drugs. I took a month off life and rested and now on the reset journey. \n\nI\u2019m now in Hawaii and took a job sailing for a few months to save money and just get into a rhythm. Two days ago I finally left the ship and staying in Hawaii for a few more months. Right now I\u2019m in a hostel but looking for rooms and a nice day job. During these Hawaii months I\u2019ve lost weight, made cool acquaintances, stayed more present in life, started school again and working towards a higher position with the maritime industry. I won\u2019t lie, sometimes I\u2019m still miserable and lost and think about my life before and wish it could have worked, but I\u2019m a lot better right now than I was post break up. I have a lot more to look forward to. Anyway sorry for the saga but I finally had a pretty great day all alone. Even tho I\u2019ve been alone when I was on the ship I became codependent on friends and work so I\u2019ve been nervous about being without those things here on the island. It\u2019s working out decently though.",

I also met some amazing likeminded people. \n\nHowever may be challenging to work remote. Not impossible though.

Several months later I moved way too quickly in another unhealthy relationship. After that ended I just started partying way too hard. During that time, my family\u2019s homes were both destroyed by a hurricane and I realized I couldn\u2019t handle being that far away if another emergency struck. \n\nOne day I was scrolling Facebook and saw a $200 weekend flight deal to Samoa for several months out. Impulsively I bought it with the intention that if I go then I\u2019m quitting my job and moving back to the states after a month or two in SE Asia following there. If I decided against it then it was a small enough amount of money that I wouldn\u2019t really miss it and I could just bail on the trip. \n\nAnyway I went solo for two weeks. During that time I navigated my way around as best I could via local busses and tried my best to immerse myself in a completely new culture. Met some awesome travelers after about a week and shared a car with them for a few days. This was way out of my comfort zone as usually it takes me a long time to warm up and trust new folks. I saw some of the most beautiful places of my life which I wouldn\u2019t have felt safe enough to visit solo because I had those travel buds. After a few days I split off from them for another week and stayed in a hut on the beach completely alone for 3 days and spoke to literally no one except for the local host family who spoke barely any English during that time. I also crushed a 900 page book then another 300 pager during that time. It was incredibly challenging but by the end it felt like I had ripped off a bandaid and was free to start a different chapter of my life with some new social skills and some once in a lifetime experiences under my belt.",

If you read between the lines, you know what I mean.\nI booked a flight to Paris and spent a week exploring the city, travelling solo for the first time and experiencing history. It made me realize there was more to life than just trying to get a relationship. Travelling for the first time open up the whole world to me . The people I met, the things I saw and the places I experienced turned my life around. Fast forward to now I no longer date.

I studied too long then went straight into the job market without taking a step back and letting myself breathe. I told myself that now is the time while I'm still young so I took a sabbatical to figure things out and travel. If I get fired, it won't be the end of the world as I'm still young and have few adult and family obligations.\n\nI started in France in Montpellier, then went to Nice. Right now I'm on the beautiful island of Corsia and will be taking a ferry to Genoa later this week. \n\nLet me tell you, it is just what the soul needed. I love how I'm letting my brain relax while traveling and that I'm also taking myself out of my comfort zone which has already helped me grow and mature as a person.\n\nMontpellier and Nice were wonderful cities with great party vibes, which allowed me to feel socialize and meet people. Meanwhile, Corsica is a dream if you're a fan of nature. I spent a week hiking from village to village and it's allowed me alot of reflection in order to think about what I want to do with my life going forward. As well, the travellers that I've met have all been very wonderful. It's just a wonderful feeling meeting someone from a completely different corner of the world, and a completely different walk of life, yet with who you can bond over the similar need to step back and free yourself by traveling.",

I just divorced, needed a reset, wanted to do something for myself. I worked for part of it but really needed the reconnect without work and was happy my wifi didn't work in Rome.\n\nRestaurants were annoying, I was constantly getting hit on by waiters. The rest of the country was amazing. I loved the history. \n\nAs another suggestion I'd say Thailand. I SO loved it there. I went with my ex but spent most of it alone because he sucks so I can recommend for a solo traveler.",

Suicidal, extremely depressed and stressed and anxious. Vowed to never return to teaching. Very pessimistic and angry towards humans and humanity in general.\n\nPlanned a trip to Japan for two weeks in January after everyone went back to school. Specifically to visit Hiroshima. My thinking was that if this country who was bombed by us (USA) and faced horrific tragedy could then just a few decades later allow us (Americans) to visit and tour, that maybe I could forgive humans too, find some goodness again. I visited the elementary school museum there and got an amazing tour by the old man running the museum (I was the only visitor at the time). \n\nEvery person I met in Japan was so kind and lovely. Everyone tried their best to help me, even if they didn\u2019t know English. I got lost one day out in the countryside after a monk convinced me to visit his temple after a conversation on the bus (lol long story) and I stopped at a little store and they helped get me to the nearest train station so I could get home. \n\nAlso can\u2019t remember where off the top of my head but I stumbled upon a little hiking path behind a temple that led up into the woods/mountains. Along the path I found tree spirits, and I can\u2019t really put into words my connection and feelings, but it was exactly what I needed. Having been non religious my whole life, the spirituality I encountered in Japan was something else.\n\nI have so much to say about that trip and it created a huge perspective shift for me that I needed. \n\nAlso I lost my little Totoro coin purse by leaving it in the bathroom before security and the airport staff found it and got it through security for me and got it to me just in the nick of time for me to board my plane.\n\nIt reset my mental health and gave me hope in humanity when I had none. Oh and I returned home to America and soon started teaching again \ud83d\ude05\n\nI would visit Japan over and over again if there weren\u2019t so many other places to visit.",

I don't know if it was a reset exactly, but it was definitely me needing something beyond a vacation. I couldn't process the trauma while in my regular routine.\n\n\nI maintained certain parts of my life. I stayed in therapy; I had occasional Zoom dates with friends. And yes, I saw a shitload of cool stuff. But I was indeed working remotely, so that automatically slowed my pace a bit, and it's a good thing it did, as it would have been tempting to not do the introspection I needed to do if I'd been go-go-go.\n\nThere was a part of me that wondered if I was \"running away,\" because dipshit psychology might indicate that. But that wasn't it at all, and now that I'm back in my home country (but not \"home\"; I gave up my apartment so I am still technically traveling, I guess) I see that I was giving myself literal distance from my family so that I would have an easier time navigating other types of distance too.\n\nDuring this time I took good care of my body, or at least the best I could. (A healthy diet and extended travel aren't mutually exclusive, but it is more difficult on the road.) I was pretty healthy before I left, but more days than not, I was conscious of the fact that my overriding priority for the day was self-care. For me that was more about meditation and journaling and lots of processing, but it logically also applied to grocery shopping and exercise and stretching and naps. Stripping away other day-to-day responsibilities certainly made that easier in many ways.",

Sublet my room in my flat for a few months, and I let my work know as I was fairly sure they'd be flexible, which they were fine with. The flat I stayed in was right next to beach, and I had no problems with wifi or anything so my work went ahead perfectly fine with only 1hr timezone difference, and swims in the ocean on mornings and lunchbreaks. I only took time off for holidays around to other areas of Spain.\n\nExercising wasnt a main priority for me, but I took up a yoga class nearby (Once I learned a few basic spanish words and phrases for body parts this was a lot easier, didnt have a clue what was going on in Class 1), and also used the meetup app for regular padel tennis classes and beach volleyball in a relaxed setting to enjoy fun exercise with a regular group of people. Once I had met some people I also did some hiking around the area (a car was usually necessary for this). The meetup app was generally a lifesaver for meeting people, mainly for me through language exchanges and international meetups (these usually happened in Alicante city - I was just outside, but had easy public transport in).\n\nAlso worth noting that I spoke basically nonexistent spanish when I got there - my plan was to learn once I arrived. Found this a little harder to organise than I anticipated, but eventually sorted a 1-1 tutor which helped me get along. Spanish people are very welcoming and friendly, and very patient with helping you practice even when you're terrible at it (me).\n\nWould 100% recommend to anyone to do, I'd love to either go back to the same place, or would do it again somewhere new. Probably though I would go back to somewhere in Spain - the people and culture is incredible and so welcoming.",

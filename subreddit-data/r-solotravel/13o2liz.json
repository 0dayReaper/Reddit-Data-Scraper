One of the biggest things for me has been using the Flight Radar 24 app when I\u2019m not traveling or preparing to travel. I casually track a flight or watch an airport for a few minutes every day, and have found it to be interesting! (And super nerdy!) This habit has \u201cnormalized\u201d flying for me. There are thousands of successful flights each and every day. My flight will be just as successful! \ud83d\ude0a",

Also started tracking flights like tubagirl on flight radar and eventually i found flying interesting and far more normalized. I think the main thing for me was understanding what was actually happening when the plane hits turbulence and thats its not the plane just falling through the sky for a second lol.",

What helped me was similar to who\u2019s you learned more about planes\u2026except I learned more about plane crashes. I have watched every episode of Air Disaster on Amazon Prime multiple times. I listen to disaster podcasts. Knowing why crashes happen and how they stop them from happening again has eased my anxiety. I also watch pilots talking about crashes, bad landings, turbulence, etc. on YouTube. Now I only worry about getting stuck in the bathroom because I swear they have gotten smaller on planes! Oh, and I haven\u2019t puked while flying since 1996.",

            "comment": "Semi-related: I used to fly all the time and enjoy it and slept often. During covid I developed panic disorder and agoraphobia and could barely leave my house. Found out about CBT and have made a lot of progress. Recently came back from a solo trip to Japan. Since flying is a more difficult thing to expose yourself to, I watched a lot of takeoff videos on YouTube. I didn\u2019t ever fear the plane crashing, though, just my own body and mind. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a medical emergency on board, pass out, die, or freak out\u201d. Flew a couple times and sat there with headphones in and earplugs and white-knuckled my way through it. Learned that feeling anxious right now was just a part of it and the anxiety can\u2019t actually hurt you. Stopped being hard on myself for used to being able to fly 14 hours no problem. I still haven\u2019t made it to where I can sleep on flights but I can fly comfortably now and not drain myself of all my energy trying not to freak out the entire flight. If it\u2019s a case of plane safety, I think reading reassuring plane statistics and, as with getting over any phobia, exposing yourself to the fear and not using any safety behaviors to get out of it. It will be uncomfortable, and hopefully you can do it with a shorter flight at first somehow. Panic attacks, while incredibly scary and uncomfortable, don\u2019t hurt you. I\u2019ve had them. Sweating, heart pounding, dizzy, tunnel vision, all at 30,000 feet in a metal tube you can\u2019t run away from. I\u2019m still here. You can do it, OP! Be easy on yourself. You can\u2019t criticize away a phobia. It\u2019s totally normal to have that response after something scary, and it isn\u2019t a life sentence",

We see that there a 0.00001% of something happens and all our brain sees is that it\u2019s not 0% and magnifies it. We tolerate a lot of uncertainty everyday, though, every time we get into a car and drive. So it\u2019s partly a mental aspect, of feeling reassured enough with the facts, and another part is \u201cI\u2019m going to do this thing and feel scared and not run away so I can show my brain it is safe so that way it doesn\u2019t keep sending my body adrenaline\u201d",

            "comment": "Flight anxiety can have different reasons. As in your case, I assume you went through a traumatic experience triggering a strong fear. This fear could have eventually turned into a single event trauma (which is defined as near death experience without being able to walk away). Search for books covering trauma and anxiety states. Do trauma body work, breathing work, autogenous training. And try to acclompish step by step what it is that you fear. As for therapy, it should be trauma therapy! Single event trauma therapy is very well established these days, but you have to find a therapist who is trained in it. Additionally, there are certain antidepressiva that block the serotonine receptors responsible for the panic attack. This way you will calm down and be capable of talking calmly to your inner self and relax.",

I still get dressed during landing, because that\u2019s the hardest part, but then I also understand how MANY landings the captains have done, and how many procedures sr in place to make sure they get it right.\n\nHope this helps a bit!

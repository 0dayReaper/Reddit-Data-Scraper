My last post was rejected because I didn't include budget or itinerary...because neither are huge relevant but here we go\n\nbudget: not a concern (I've been saving for a while) \n\nitinerary: cebu/boracay for 5-10 days depending on your recommendations \n\ninterests: diving and meeting people (it's literally in the title)\n\nresearch i've already done: I know there are many schools to pick from, I just want recommendations",

The canyon thing was a lot of fun!",

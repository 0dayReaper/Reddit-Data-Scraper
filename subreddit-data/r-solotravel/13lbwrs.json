    "postText": "Hi! I'm planning a Taiwan solo trip in the fall. I don't know if I should take 2 or 3 weeks, hoping to get some input! I would like to do some hikes, see a variety of sites (nature, cultural sites), try new food, and experience some night life. This is a very broad-strokes rough idea of what I might do:\n\nTaipei 2 days (will be back 3 more days at end of trip)\n\nSun Moon Lake 1 day\n\nAlishan 1 day (not sure if I will do this since it seems hard to get to)\n\nTainan 2-3 days\n\nKaohsiung 2-3 days\n\nTaroko 1 day\n\nTaipei and surrounding areas 3 days - possibly a loop around Yangmingshan, Keelung, Jiufen?\n\nFactor in a few days for travel time and I think I'd be looking at just over 2 weeks. Thoughts? Is that too much? Anything I shouldn't or should skip?",

            "comment": "2 weeks is probably fine. Taiwan is weird though as everything is spread out and the best nature areas are on the east coast which is not as developed and more mountainous which makes travel slower. Language also becomes a bigger issue s as you get away from places like Taipei and Taichung. Also, if you do speak mandarin, it\u2019ll be less useful the farther south you go. While most people obviously still can speak it, you\u2019ll hear way more Taiwanese outside Taipei. \n\nBut you\u2019ll only need a day or two at most places to see everything unless you really want to dive into the culture and food. \n\nSource: I used to live there.\n\nEdit: also, if you can, try not to go during a major Taiwanese holiday. Practically the whole country will be traveling during those times.",

And how many more days would you suggest I add? \n\nEast coast looks so beautiful! Starting to lean more towards 3 weeks then perhaps I could fit some more destinations in",

Taichung is a great food city and you have to check out the night markets (check them out everywhere actually). It\u2019s actually where boba tea was invented. \n\nDon\u2019t let the smell of stinky tofu put you off. It only smells bad while cooking and tastes amazing. \n\nAnd always ask what the local delicacy is. Seemingly every place in Taiwan is famous for some food. Just ask a local what the town us famous for and they\u2019ll tell you proudly. And everyone on the island will claim that it just isn\u2019t as good anywhere else (honestly the last part is often debatable but it\u2019ll still win you points with the locals).",

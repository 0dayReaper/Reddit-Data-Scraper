    "postText": "I am planning on getting working holiday visa and flying to Australia november or december. I am a little bit worried about job opportunities since I have been seeing comments about how difficult it is to get a job as a backpacker. Is it really that hard? \n\nI would be seeking for farming, fruitpicking, cleaning etc. jobs. So I am not picky about job searching. It also seems that many employers demand that you have your own transportation especially on remote areas because of the distance.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m currently on my second WHV, got to Melbourne in November, and had a job in the otways within about two/three weeks and have been here since. I\u2019ve just gotten another job to move on to WA in the next few weeks which took me a week to get. However, I had to apply for a ton of jobs before I was picked \n\nI\u2019d recommend getting your own vehicle as Australia is massive and if you\u2019re having to get the bus everywhere you\u2019re going to be miserable, and outside of major cities public transport is severely lacking because there isn\u2019t a need for it as everyone drives. I\u2019d also strongly advise looking for jobs with accommodation included as we\u2019re in the middle of a housing crisis and there are more people looking to rent than there are apartments. They\u2019re also staggeringly expensive. Seek is good, as well as Indeed but as a WHM you likely won\u2019t be eligible for full time work, that is permanent so you need to be looking for casual positions \n\nGood luck!",

In fact for fruit picking I just turned up on the day and they got me to fill out the paperwork without doing an interview at all. Don\u2019t sweat it, Australia is well set up to employ backpackers. Honestly, once you experience it you\u2019ll think it was silly that you ever worried about it",

Like even in July when I went back, I was offered a job somewhere, but yea definitely depends where you go. I did traffic control for my 2nd/3rd year, was pretty fun. Also working in two different packing sheds which was also pretty good but much more seasonal, less hours usually",

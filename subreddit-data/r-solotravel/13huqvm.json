Hanoi (1 or 2N) &gt; Sapa Ha Giang (Total: 5N), Hike Fansipan as well &gt; Cao Bang (1-2N).\r  \nHanoi (1 or 2N) &gt; (Mai Chau  or Hai Phong for 1N) &gt; Ninh Binh (2N max, can spend 3rd day exploring and spend the 3N on sleeper bus)\r  \n\\&gt; Hue (1N Maybe and take Hai Van pass to Danang/Hoi an) &gt; Hoi An/Danang (Spend 4-5N)\n\nI think that's would max out the days comfortably",

You\u2019re missing the whole south of the country, which is awesome and has a different culture and food style than the north does.\n\nThe great thing about Vietnam is you don\u2019t need to plan things in advance. Just book your flights and a place to stay the first couple nights. After that work your way through the country as you feel. Nothing worse than being totally over a city and still having two full days already booked there with nothing to do.",

Hue is also a very cool place to spend one day.  Do the Hai Van pass from Da Nang to Hue and check out the Mausoleum City (An Bang City of Ghosts).\n\nThe only thing I disagree with is the need for much experience to do the Ha Giang loop.  Try out a motorbike ahead of time just to get comfortable but after that you'll be good to go.  I went with an organized tour and rode my own bike.  I'd recommend doing that as they can help you avoid the police who check for licenses.  If you do get pulled over it's a 1mil bribe to get through.",

Definitely one of my favorite cities of all SE Asia, and I preferred a lot over Hanoi. \n\n- instead of all the nights in Hanoi, Ninh binh, and Da Nang, I would personally include a 3-4 night trip to Sapa for the hiking (idk if you\u2019re into it tho obv). \n\n\nBest of luck, it\u2019ll be a blast.

I think I spent 2 nights in Hanoi (preferred to HCMC because of French pastry shops, weather, and art), then did an overnight train to Sapa to spend a day or two.  Overnighted back to Hanoi to book a Halong Bay excursion.  I have seen the lovely Limestone karsts of Thailand and still would not miss Cat Ba/Halong Bay.  I went during a super-busy Vietnamese holiday, hate tourist crowds, and still would not miss Halong Bay.  There are non-populated island excursion with hikes, kayaking options among the floating villages, or just chill on the boat, take in the scenery and grab some snacks from the row boats cruising around.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure if it exists still, but the flex pass bus ticket was awesome.  If you\u2019re flying, that\u2019s cool too.  From Hanoi I was able to hop on and off along the coast to HCMC at leisure so I didn\u2019t have to coordinate bus or flight tickets.  I stopped a day to two at: Hue, Hoi An, Nha Trang (best thing here is Island tours), Mui Ne (small fishing town, motorbike to red sand dunes, watch out for child thieves), and HCMC (wins in the pho department, also don\u2019t miss the war museum) From here I took a day tour to the Mekong Delta which was rad, then flew home.\n\nEspecially liked:  Sapa, Halong Bay, Hue, Hoi An\n\nWould go again:  Sapa (would like to go on longer multi-day trek into hill tribes), check out more of Mekong Delta area\n\nHear great things about:  motor biking the loop around Dalat",

Dalat is another interesting place between Hoi an and HCMC you could look at. Da nang is very close to hoi an so unless you\u2019re interested in the night lights in da nang, you could give that a skip",

You can do kayaking, midnight squid fishing, visiting some villages on the water and the food is amazing. Also maybe you could try and pop over to Cambodia for a couple days? Angkor Wat is breathtaking.",

If you the money you can get the VIP boat it's a few hundred bucks as opposed to less than 100 for the standard trip. Might be worth it. example [https://www.indochina-junk.com/](https://www.indochina-junk.com/)\n\nIn Ninh Binh stay in Trang An\n\nHoi An/Danang if you know how to drive a motorbike already, you could just stay whole time in Hoi An then motorbike up to Danang it's only half an hour or so.\n\nHappy Travels!\n\nps. this is NOT too much time in Hanoi, tons to see, tons to eat, a very unique city",

Just not the vibe for me.\n\nLoved hoi an and Hanoi though. Ninh Binh was breathtakingly. I only stayed there for a day but it was gorgeous. Quite a bit touristy though. \n\nHCMC was just a bit too chaotic for me. I loved japan town, the parks, and walking around Ben Thanh. But it felt a bit 'too large'. And this is coming from someone who goes to thailand and bangkok regularly. The traffic was the craziest I've ever experienced in my life.\n\nHoi An was small but it felt like I still had more to see. Met a lot of digital nomad ppl and locals. I may be biased b/c it fits my vibe the best b/c I spend most of my time in Chiang Mai when im in asia. Also if I go again, I would definitely do Ha Giang Loop\n\nHanoi was great, would definitely live there if I could.",

Started in Hanoi about 3 weeks ago:\n\nHa Giang loop 100% worth it incredible experience\n\nI did some day cruise in CatBa, took the ferry to get there, paid $50 canadian it was pretty chill, felt a bit lonely because most people on there are couples and families.\n\nI don\u2019t think you need 3 nights in Ninh Binh, I did some mountain trek thing for one day and that was about it, it\u2019s pretty quite for a solo traveller\n\nI only did one day in Hoi An I got pretty bored. You could do the Golden bridge if you want",

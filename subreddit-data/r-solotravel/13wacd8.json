    "postText": "I have been looking for a daytrip tour that includes Osmena Peak, but I cannot find any group ones - they are all private which charge over 7000 pesos since I would be signing up solo. \n\nIs it better to ask at the hostel and go on one of their affiliated tours? (Did this in Vietnam) - Or is it simply better to not use a tour?\n\nThanks in advance.",

You will pass by several tourist spots along the way as well as Osme\u00f1a Peak. If you\u2019re not up for this, try to ask a local to drive you to Osme\u00f1a Peak instead of joining the daytrip tour. I did the drive from Cebu city before COVID and had so much fun! Good luck! :)",

            "comment": "Are you going to Moalboal or Oslob?  You can include this in that trip.  You can hire a private car and driver for trip for around 3000 peso, I would guess, from Cebu.  Many taxis in Cebu have a price chart on the back of the front seat showing the possible places they can take you and the price.  You can bargain.\n\nAssuming you are going to many parts of Cebu, you would be going to Moalboal anyway, so best to go from there.  There will be day tours from Moalboal that include Osmena Peak and some pretty good waterfalls.  This may be dependent on the time of year though.  You could hire a motorcycle and do it yourself, if you are competant on it, but be aware that trucks and buses are on the roads as well.  If you don't have a motorcycle licence, then your travel insurance will not cover you for any accidents you have.",

    "postText": "2nd time in the DR, last time was just a resort in Punta Cana and a day trip to Isla Catalina.\n\nI\u2019m thinking somethitn like this:\n\n5 nights Playa Dominicus Bayahibe - Beach, dive trip, and a trip to Isla Saona \n1 night Santo Domingo - Colonial center \n5 nights - Saman\u00e1 - Exploring all the different beaches/mountains\n\nAm I staying too long, too short anywhere? Would it be worth a night on Isla Saona? Maybe add time somewhere else? Whats the best town in the Saman\u00e1 pen\u00ednsula? Santo Domingo worth seeing a day?\n\nMostly looking for beaches, diving, adventure activities, mountains/jungle hikes.\n\nNot too into resorts/relax type of thing. I\u2019m pretty flexible on everything but I already have a ticket to Punta Ca\u00f1a Airport. Trip is in early September.",

You get on a boat, you go out into the ocean about 3 hours, then you sit there until something gets hooked and the kicker is some of them reel it in for you so you don't even get to do that. \n\nWhat you should do is 4 wheeling. I did that and it was fun and you get to see a good little chunk of the island.",

            "comment": "I've been to the DR multiple times and I like your itinerary. I usually stay for a month in a small beach town in the south and drive around the island from there (the locals drive so badly). It's probably already on your list, but try to get to Bah\u00eda de las \u00c1guilas to see the clearest water (and not much else). Stay away from Punta Cana and Boca Chica unless you can really handle yourself around the tourists and scammers. Not worth staying the night on Saona Island imo. I really liked Santo Domingo, but wouldn't stay more than a day there if I could spend that time on the beach instead. Make sure to visit the historical center where the fortresses are and Tres Ojos National Park if you've got the time to do the excursion. Food is best in the smaller towns outside of the main cities. Enjoy the DR!",

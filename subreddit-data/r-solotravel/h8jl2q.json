    "postText": "I am an introvert and I have anxiety about new things, but most of my acquaintances  would never believe it.\n\nI once bought a $7 hotel room in the middle of no where China (\"cabbage with engine oil\" on the English room service menu), taken a train to get there using my horrible Chinese and amazing miming skills, ate breakfast smacking and sucking my teeth like a local to show appreciation, and had a fabulous time (even if most breakfast dishes had fish in them ugh). I have also gone out of my way to go to a restaurant I already know or spent an hour on my phone looking at reviews, just so that I'm not going into a restaurant blind. A restaurant. In America. In English. \n\nThis will be a rambling talk on solo travel, taking chances, fear and anxiety, joy, an introvert talking to strangers, and whatever else comes up. \n\nI have now traveled to 26 countries, 11 last year, on 6 continents many of them alone, and I Still get sweaty palms thinking about catching a bus without knowing how/how much/what to pay. The internet is a godsent crutch for these things, but I'm very slowly working on just winging it. Sometimes people are impatient for a minute but then the encounter is over! No harm done, no matter how silly/idiotic you look or sound. Sometimes, it breaks the ice and there is a fun moment. Like in Australia, a guy shouted \"bike coming through\". I went to step to the right out of habit, but then froze, \"Is it right in Australia or left?\". I made my self as small as possible like a hare with an owl nearby. I must have said the last bit out loud, because he stopped, and we had a conversation (it's left), then we had a beer together at a local watering hole. He also recommended cane toad racing that night where I proceeded to be paid in beer to be a rather unfortunately distracted scorekeeper. Good times.\n\nI am an introvert, in that I recharge alone, but with effort I'm also fairly outgoing. To make travel work without loneliness, you have to/get to break out of your shell and meet new people. You don't get to stay in the comfy bubble of your travel companions. From ladyboys in Bangkok, to Irish rugby fans in Hong Kong, to a young Chinese boy in Chongqing so excited to practice his English; you can learn and grow by meeting others. It's amazing, horizon opening, and EXHAUSTING. It's still hard for me to break into a group or conversation without an opening. The random Norwegians on my Spanish sailing outing? Sure, we have a reason to talk as we share a cheese plate! We chatted, then ended up meeting their other friends for hookah and Persian food. The idea of just walking up to a stranger to see if they want to hang out? Kill me now. Even a cold phone call to order a damn pizza gives me anxiety, let alone approaching a stranger. I'm working on it. \n\nThe most important thing with meeting new people, is to try to move from \"how are you\", weather, bs, as soon as possible and get to deeper conversation. Sometimes, I'm good at this but sometimes I'm not. I'm currently reading I'm Sorry I'm Late, I Didn't Want To Come, about a shy introvert pretending to be an extrovert for a year. She covers a lot of these topics but spends a lot of time on asking real questions and trading real information. No one likes the \"ya, fine, ya fine\" conversation. I recommend her book, especially if you are shy as well as introverted. \n\nAllowing myself to be silly and curious has really helped with my joy in life. Dress up for the party! Put on war paint! Dance! Turns out most people are just waiting for \"permission\" to do things themselves or at least admire you for doing so. Really, what's the last embarrassing thing that you remember someone ELSE doing? I'll wait. \n\nThere is a lot of joy in my life, but there is a lot of forcing it. Forcing myself to get out of bed, out of the door, scheduling/committing to things I'm not sure about (sometimes without allowing myself to think about it too much), and putting myself in situations where I HAVE to go spread my wings. It doesn't feel natural or comfortable, especially when anxiety manifests as exhaustion, but I almost never regret it. A lot of people say \"I wish I could...\" to me, but they usually, well, don't, at least not enough to put the work in. I once met a guy who was a white water rafting guide during the summers (3-4 months), said he made his own clothes, ate out of garbage cans, and saved every penny so that he could backpack around thailand every year without working for 8-9 months. Obviously this is an extreme example and has some serious drawbacks, but if he can make \"it\" happen, so can you. What do you want and how much do you want it??\n\nAll of this brings us to now, as my anxiety has me procrastinating HARD. I am glad that my job of 9 years has laid me off. It was the kick in the butt I needed, and I KNOW there's so many great adventures, a more interesting job, new friends (while keeping the old), etc. I attempted to quit last year for this very reason (they talked me into a sabbatical instead). I'm even in a financial situation to allow me to explore and enjoy. I'm ECSTATIC... and terrified. I'm finding zero motivation to wrap up the last bits of work, build my resume, and pack; because, damnit, then I have to do it. I'm afraid of failure, of being somewhere I hate, not finding a job, losing all of my friends and dying alone. Yup. I'll get it done because I always do, way more last minute than necessary, more anxiety than necessary, but it'll happen.\n\nI don't know if anyone is still reading this, but I hope it inspires someone to give something a shot. An amazing life doesn't just happen, its not luck, or even a personality type. The people you see gallivanting the world don't have it as easy as they make it look (or maybe not at all with Photoshop). Also, if you're genuinely happy staying home and doing your thing, good for you. We need all types. This is aimed at someone who ISN'T happy, who is in a rut, lonely... Take a chance. Don't settle. Force it and keep forcing it. Wring every drop out of life's anxiety-inducing neck whether that means quitting your miserable job, taking your first solo trip, or moving to China (I've done all of these). \n\nLove to all. Good luck!\n\nEdit: Wow! Thanks for the gold and all of the awesome comments. The book also suggests being vulnerable, so here I am and here are all of you. Hugs!",

            "comment": "Oooh fellow introvert traveller here. I find that I am much more open when the chance of embarrassing myself in front of people I will see again is reduced. When I\u2019m across the world, it definitely helps those chances. The same reason is why I travel alone; I love my friends but the stresses of travel make me afraid that it could cause us to have quarrels that would not be ideal when you\u2019re stranded with no one but each other. They also have a biased opinion of me and I am more afraid to break out of my shell with them around. \n\nBut when I\u2019m alone, I can approach random people and be as open as I want because I\u2019ll probably never see them again. So when I\u2019m at a hostel, I\u2019ll make friends with everyone in the room and grab a few drinks or meals together and it\u2019s truly great fun. You get to share each other\u2019s experiences and personal favourites. \n\nBig thing also is that it\u2019s much harder to integrate into local culture when you bring your home culture in the form of people. Sure you\u2019re more comfortable around people you know, but you\u2019re not exactly forced to blend in as much since there is nothing pushing you to speak to people or try new things.",

The anonymity part definitely makes it easier, though I still challenge you to remember the last time a coworker or vague acquaintance did something embarrassing. No one cares that much, too wrapped up in their own stuff. (Tell that to the anxiety lol)\n\nHave you ever talked to your friends about things that don't fit their idea/mold of you? It could cause you to grow apart, but it could cause you go grow together more too as you admit to \"weird\" likes. \n\nEither way, you're right, no matter how close or open your friends are, its a MUCH different experience traveling without them, eating when you want, ready to jump on whatever opportunity. \n\nI've always avoided hostels because its usually only a few bucks more to get an airbnb room and I can go recharge and get a good night's sleep. I think I'm missing out on the community though. Next appropriate trip, its a goal to try it at least once.",

When I\u2019m in a bad mood, I can have a short temper and take it out on others around me so I try to limit my exposure when I\u2019m having a bad day. But I\u2019m working on it! \n\nI definitely love the spontaneity being solo brings on trips too. Everything is up to me; even if I originally had a major attraction planned and had tickets payed for and everything, I\u2019m the only one it affects if I were to change plans so it\u2019s great. \n\nI definitely prefer airbnbs for comfort but I actually love hostels because everyone there is so open and friendly to others since many are also solo. One of the best experiences I had was at the generator hostel chain; it\u2019s basically like a hotel size building and it is very clean since they have a reputation. Many of them also have rooftop bars so it\u2019s great to meet people! Hostels are a definite must try when travelling solo",

Things can happen anywhere: even if you lived in a baby proof house with ninja guards you could slip in the bath. The illusion of safety isn't worth cramping your life.\n\nThat being said, I do a lot of little things that help mitigate risk that take very little time. Something along the lines of: \"If its 90% as fun, pick the safer option\".\n\nWhen I overland alone, I have an InReach, a lot of extra food and water, first aid supplies, and recovery gear. When I hike somewhere remote, I carry enough gear to get me through a night out there just in case.\n\nIf I'm eating or drinking alone, I will take my drink to the bathroom, or ask 1 or even TWO people with good vibes to watch my drink.\n\nI check in with my best friend back home. He knows where I should be hotel wise anyway, and we have a 24 hour check in rule. Ive sent him details of who I'm with a couple of times when I was going to their homes. Note that I have the same rule at home. Things can happen anywhere.\n\nI don't drink past tipsy alone. Not much fun anyway.\n\nI have my \"obvious\" wallet with small money and one atm card, and a money belt with the rest of my cash, an ATM card to a different account, and my passport (if it isn't in a safe). Don't flash money. Don't wear expensive jewelry.\n\nBe aware. Make eye contact with anyone who looks too interested or might be following you. Never use more than one headphone.\n\nDress appropriately for the local culture.\n\nEdit: a word.",

I'm now kinda stuck in the middle of a very career focused part of my life and I miss that feeling which you so accurately described. one thing I worry about is in the future and I find a partner....will I miss solo travelling? even with an amazing partner, I feel not being alone takes away some of the challenge that pushes you to be a better person. do you ever think about that in your future?",

I\u2019m mostly on top of it now and lead a \u201cnormal\u201d life, however there are times when I\u2019m travelling overseas and it still holds me back from doing certain things. Even though naturally, like so many others here, I am naturally way more confident and extroverted abroad. \n\nI prefer to travel solo and it\u2019s still a constant battle to force and push myself to go that extra mile and throw myself into situations which my anxiety is telling me not to do. In doing so I have missed out on doing some really cool things which I totally could have participated in on my travels.\n\nWhen it\u2019s safe to travel again I am determined to travel again and to push myself further and further out of the grasp that anxiety holds.\n\nCan relate to a lot of the common themes both in your post and in the comments. So many like minded people on here I love it :)",

But I'm an indecisive person so I know I'm going to need to look into it more than just having a gut feeling Haha.\n\nJust talking about it seems crazy because people who know me probably don't see me as the type of person to move to a country where the main language isn't english Haha.",

It's the same thing I do with my fear of heights when I want to zip line, or my claustrophobia on a crowded elevator. Its tiring but it works for me. Breathing control and suppression. It allows me to nip it in the bud before it becomes a panic attack.\n\nI'd say just book something... And think about it later, but that's hard right now. When it's safe to travel, just do it! Flexing the muscles helps a lot.",

I visited a lady I met in Bangkok at her home in New Zealand. I honestly haven't tried that hard because I have friends at home, but on my next adventure I'm going to see if I can get past just having a fun evening together or whatever. It's hard to have a favorite, because all of them were little snapshots into somebody's life which were all amazing because of their colorful variety.\n\nA favorite trip is kind of the same way. How do you pick between diving to great barrier reef, climbing Kilimanjaro, Whitewater kayaking through the atlas mountains of Morocco, pit crewing for the Baja 1000, tracking the Peruvian Andes to get to Machu Picchu, accidentally stumbling on the Trevi fountain in Rome....\n\nThere are absolutely days, especially on long trips, did I just sit on a balcony, or beach, or even in bed all day and read. It's hard, because they feel like wasted days when you may never come back, but at some point I have to. Damn it it's supposed to be fun and a vacation!",

I'll start a conversation with someone in the street or in a cafe and get high off it, but the social interaction required by the day-to-day often washes me out. I've never really figured it out. Something to do with strangers not expecting or demanding anything of me, I think.",

            "comment": "Thanks for sharing. I\u2019m also very introverted. \n\nI suddenly had enough of the routine. Quit and moved to another country. I told myself it was to learn another language. Every decision up to that point was a good decision as judged by society. Work hard. Study. Get a good job. Climb the corporate ladder. Buy a house. Get married. Have a kid. \n\nI was on that path and hated knowing my future. \n\nThe best decision I ever made was to quit and travel. It brought me out of the shell. I\u2019m still an introvert but I worked through the avoiding conversation to actually enjoying it. While living abroad I also traveled to +25 countries. Being in foreign in another country is a great icebreaker. It\u2019s much easier than you think to meet people. In every country I met someone very cool. \n\nIt was suppose to be 1 year and turned into 5. If I could do it again I\u2019d have found a way to work remotely first. Or at least teach English somewhere. There are so many ways to earn money remotely but I saved up so much I didn\u2019t have too. But that cane to an end so I came back to work. \n\nReturning to work was a mixed bag of feelings. I was actually ready to come back because the lifestyle was getting old. Living from a large bag and backpack for old. A new beautiful beach was just like any other at some point. Hanging out was feeling like I had no purpose. Living all over the place. I miss it at times and will definitely do it again. But for now I\u2019m definitely much happier working and building back up for the next adventure. I know how to set it up now and not dwindle savings. The plan will be 2 years and I\u2019ll be ready for round 2. No more wasting money either because I know how far it can go while traveling.",

Then last year I took an unpaid sabbatical. I'm glad I chose a profession that allows so much travel while still having a home base and pay.\n\nThere is definitely such a thing as travel fatigue. Big cities all start looking the same... Beaches, waterfalls, lakes, mountains can do it too to a certain extent. The fourth or fifth temple or church or museum start to blur together. To combat this, I try to see very different places after each other, but it's definitely more expensive that way. I would much rather see Rome for three days a dozen times than be there a month, but \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nShoestring travel is something I want to work on while I don't have to.

    "postText": "I previously posted in this subreddit that I'm deaf and have never solo travelled before. So many of you have given me helpful advice, so I think I'm ready for my first trip to Italy! Please note that I haven't even booked flight tickets because I didn't expect that I would be getting laid off so soon and have the entire summer off so I am trying to get this sorted out as soon as possible. My budget is about $5-7k. \n\n**Day 1 (in July):**  \n\n* Arrive in Rome from Toronto. \n* Take taxi into the city and check into a hotel (I don't want to stay in a hostel because I have digestive issues and I am a huge introvert, so I value my private time). \n* Walk around and have meals. \n\n**Day 2 to 4:**\n\nExploring Rome: \n\n* Colosseum \n* Italy Foundation \n* Palatine Hill \n* Altar of the Fatherland \n* Capitol Hill \n* Piazza Navona \n* The Pantheon \n* Trevor Foundation \n* Spanish Steps \n\n**Day 5 to 7:** \n\nGo to Florence by train and check into a hotel. \n\n* The Duomo Complex\n* Michelangelo's Statue of David \n* Piazza della Signoria the Bargello Museum \n* Palazzo Vecchio \n\n**Day 8 to 10:** \n\nGo to Vatican City by train and check into a hotel.\n\n* Pala d'Oro \n* Torre dell'Orologio \n* Doge's Palace \n* Ponte della Palla \n* Bridge of Sighs \n* Grand Canal \n* Gondola Ride \n* Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute \n\n**Day 11:** \n\n* Return to Rome by train and then fly out \n\nAlso I would greatly appreciate if you could share any safety tips! I will lock my backpack/bag when I go out. Do you carry your passports in your bag? Some said leave it in a hotel but I'm not sure about that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much!!!",

For other sights you will need to wait in line a long time. The queue for the Pantheon can take hours. \n\nI doubt the prices for Paris will be lower. Hotels might be similar (depending on the quality you expect. Especially in Paris but also Rome you can find cheaper, but very shabby and dirty places.), but many other things like food are a lot more expensive in Paris.",

Was my first trip to IT and I've been to FR 5 or 6 times.  The main thing I would change is to do a trip in this order... \n\nParis&gt;Venice&gt;Florence&gt;Rome\n\nAnd fly from Rome to Toronto with the direct flight.\n\nIf you consider this \"outside of the box\" thinking, you might save time and money.\n\nDoes flying to Paris and flying back from Rome for just under $900 USD sound good?\n\n[https://www.google.com/travel/flights/search?tfs=CBwQAhoqEgoyMDIzLTA5LTEzKABqDAgDEggvbS8waDdoNnIMCAMSCC9tLzA1cXRqQAFIAXABggELCP\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_wGYAQI](https://www.google.com/travel/flights/search?tfs=CBwQAhoqEgoyMDIzLTA5LTEzKABqDAgDEggvbS8waDdoNnIMCAMSCC9tLzA1cXRqQAFIAXABggELCP___________wGYAQI)\n\n[https://www.google.com/travel/flights/search?tfs=CBwQAhoqEgoyMDIzLTA5LTI0KABqDAgDEggvbS8wNmM2MnIMCAMSCC9tLzBoN2g2QAFIAXABggELCP\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_wGYAQI](https://www.google.com/travel/flights/search?tfs=CBwQAhoqEgoyMDIzLTA5LTI0KABqDAgDEggvbS8wNmM2MnIMCAMSCC9tLzBoN2g2QAFIAXABggELCP___________wGYAQI)\n\nRight now it costs a little more to fly round trip from Toronto to Rome.  But let's pretend a round trip from Toronto to Rome cost the same.  What about the time and money it takes to backtrack to somewhere you've been?\n\nWould be a shame if you spent more time and money to NOT got to Paris on your trip.  Just walking down the street in Le Marais... I forgot how alive I felt and I was just there two years ago.\n\n[https://goo.gl/maps/Lsaxg3t6LmKuUBpZ6](https://goo.gl/maps/Lsaxg3t6LmKuUBpZ6)\n\nYou probably already know this... the bakeries in France... you're not allowed to use the word boulangerie on your signs unless the bread is baked on premise.  And a few boulangeries in Paris will display their Meilleurs Ouvriers de France signs which I didn't know was so hard to earn.  And having been to Paris and Rome on the same trip... Rome was SO chaotic haha  But should definitely go to both on this trip.\n\nNot sure if I'm remembering correctly but if you were on the fence before... Might sound odd but I'm really happy to hear it all (didn't book your flights, delayed your trip and looking to add France, being laid off) if it helped you decide to go on a nice trip.  It's late and I'm not sure if I'm making sense.  Let me know if you have any questions.",

Honestly, the main thing I have had to worry about abroad is listening for oncoming traffic on roads/sidewalks.  Some countries' traffic are more chaotic than others, and I don't know where Italy is on the scale yet. There's some quiet scooters out there. I've been lightly hit by one in Taiwan \ud83d\ude05. Just try not to get too distracted when walking around. For public transport, I suggest sitting near any screens that tells you the stops or look at google maps for the dots. I usually leave my passport in my accommodations because I figure the chances of it getting stolen there are lower than potentially losing it outside. I just carry a paper copy with me in my bag.",

            "comment": "Hi! First of all - IMO it's so much better to do Rome off season (Spring/Fall). I was there twice in the Summer and didn't find it very enjoyable - WAY too hot to walk around (maybe not too bad if you can cope with temperatures around 40\u00b0 C \ud83d\ude05), also more people at the main attractions than off-season o/c.\n\nThe traffic is more chaotic than in the North, but not as crazy in south Italy. I'd definitely carry passport/money/credit card in a small bag on your body/under your shirt or sthg., NOT in a pocket (or leave passport in the hotel, although technically you're required to have your ID with you if anything happens) Pickpocketing is definitely the biggest risk here (I felt a bit safer in evry other italian city tbh)\n\nRegarding you itinerary:\n\nI would do Vatican in 1 day (technically, the main atractions are even doable in half a day), and go from Florence to Bologna for 2 days (it's 38 min. by the fast train/Frecciarossa). \n\nIt's quite an underrated/overlooked city, but absolutely lovely..history/culture-wise, lots of cool street art too. Not as touristy as Rome/Florence, more of a university city, therefore also cheaper (accommodations, food..6-7\u20ac pizzas, one of the best I've ever had!) The traffic is also not as crazy there.\n\n Definitely check out the Anatomy theatre at the University (the oldest one in the western world btw!). It's a much more relaxed experience than Rome or Florence - those have great things to see too, don't get my wrong, but it's nice to spend some time in a more relaxed city to come down a bit ime.\n\nI would also consider to maybe fly out of Bologna/Venezia/Firenze than Rome to save some travelling time (&amp; less stressful imo), in case there's any flights from there.\n\nI'd still book B&amp;Bs/hotels 2-3 months in advance, the prices obviously go up quite a lot when you book 2-3 weeks prior. Also B&amp;B are a good + cheaper alternative to hotels, you still get your privacy &amp; breakfast is often included :)\n\nEdit: typos",

Though if your interests are aligned particularly for the specific monuments that Florence has to offer, then obviously do that",

In 99% of cases people will be accommodating, particularly in busy places such as on transport. \n\nI would say being HoH much less of an issue in Italy compared to other places though so I hope you have a  fantastic trip!",

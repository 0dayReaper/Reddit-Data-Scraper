    "postText": "Hey guys! I am planning a months stay (at least) in Santa Marta, Colombia. Flying out of Florida, USA. 29 year old Male. \n\nI am wanting to book a 1-way-flight out of the country so that I can have flexibility on when I fly back to the States. I work remotely and may want to stay longer than 30 days. My question regarding Customs: will I have any trouble with Customs because of the 1-way-flight? I don\u2019t want to get involved in Customs nonsense if it can be avoided.\n\nDo y\u2019all see any potential issues with this scenario? \n\nBonus: leave any Colombian travel tips you may have or wise words for a first-time solo traveler !",

So if they ask for it, and you don't have it they will not let you entry the country. However, I've heard of people booking a flight out of Colombia on the spot, and they were let in the country afterwards. But I would advise you to book your ticket back beforehand.",

I didn\u2019t mind it at all when i first got there but after going to towns nearby that were magical i realized how shit it was \ud83d\ude2d. I recommend you go to Minca (absolutely wonderful people and views, breathtaking) and further up the coast (I\u2019m in palomino rn)",

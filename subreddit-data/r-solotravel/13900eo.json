    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m nearing the end of my trip in Colombia, and I want to end it with a huge adventure in the Amazon!\n\nI\u2019ve heard from some locals that you can do overnight stays deep in the Amazon (walking, canoeing, and sleeping in hammocks) for 6-7 days. Has anyone has any experience with this? I\u2019m having trouble finding any information about these longer immersive adventures online (pretty much all I know at this point is to show up to Leticia as the starting point).\n\nIm really looking for a fully immersive experience where I can be out of cellphone reception, barely any technology, trudging through mid/canoeing through flooded jungles, for at least a week.\n\nLet me know if you have any recommendations for local tour operators that do this kind of thing!",

I did it through the hostel in the town of Leticia",

So I decided to just figure it out when I land. \n\nWorked out great, the hostels tour plan was exactly what I wanted, translator and tour guide were amazing, and it was cheaper. \n\nThe tour was through casa de las palmas hostel. You can lock your stuff up in the lockers free, and they give you rubber boots and all. I\u2019m not sure if they offer longer tours though. It\u2019s worth an ask id say",

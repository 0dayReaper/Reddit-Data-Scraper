    "postText": "I\u2019m traveling by myself and decided to stay at a party hostel for the last few nights of my trip. It was a great time up until this morning. \n\nOur dorm room just had me and two guys in it. They seemed nice enough last night when I met them. I was chatting with one of them this morning, laying on my bed and messing around on my phone, when he gets up and climbs into my bed with me. I just froze up for a second because I was so shocked and he apparently took that as me being ok with it, because he pulled me towards him and tried to cuddle. \n\nI told him to fuck off and tried to get up, but he just wrapped his arms around me and wouldn\u2019t let go. He laughed like I was overreacting even though I\u2019m fucking terrified at this point and pinned down by some man I don\u2019t know. \n\nHe didn\u2019t get up until I said I had a boyfriend, which is really messed up, but I was just so relieved he let go that I basically sprinted from the room. This was a few hours ago and he\u2019s checked out of the hostel now, so there\u2019s really nothing else to do about it, but I\u2019m still shaken up after the whole thing. I haven\u2019t stayed in many hostels before and I never expected my dorm mates to act like that. Idk what to do at this point but I really don\u2019t want to sleep in another room full of guys.",

This is not something I have seen (or been reported) a lot, but when I have, I kick out the person instantly and warn neighboring hostels about the dude. It always striked me how surprised they seem when I tell them to pack their shit and fuck off. If you, god forbid, find yourself in another situation similar to this, don't hesitate to report it to the reception/manager. They normally don't look kindly on that.\n\n100% unacceptable, sorry you had to get through this.",

I\u2019ve been through something similar when I was traveling and the thoughts of \u201cI should\u2019ve done more, I should\u2019ve stopped him sooner, I should\u2019ve known,\u201d etc filled my head even though objectively it\u2019s not my fault that I assumed he wasn\u2019t a terrible scum of a human. It\u2019s really easy to succumb to that shameful feeling. I still don\u2019t like talking about it. \n\nMy point is, you handled the situation incredibly well! You saved yourself and are doing really good at taking care of yourself after the fact. Asking for help is really hard and brave. You can definitely still report it now even after he\u2019s gone. The hostel can flag his name in case he returns in the future. And they can warn any other hostels in the area or across the country that they have relationships with. \n\nYou\u2019re doing everything right. Keep it up. Big internet hugs to you.",

But the experience had me super shaken up and I have not stayed in a mixed dorm since.\n\nI literally waited until 8AM for the reception to open and told them what happened. I said I didn\u2019t care how much it cost to move me a female dorm, I wanted to move to a new room ASAP. The staff was super understanding, they told me that not all hostels are like this and unfortunately it takes one person to ruin it. They assigned me to a new room right away at no charge. As I was moving out, I warned a girl who was staying in my now previous room what happened. \n\nMy advice to you is just do it. It\u2019s just better piece of mind. Your bed is your personal space and you should feel safe in it.",

I\u2019m glad that you were able to put a stop to the situation that it is over now. \n\nAs a fellow solo female traveler that opts for hostels during my travels, I\u2019ll share my personal story in solidarity.\n\nA few years ago, I stayed in a big mixed-dorm room (about 24 bunk beds). I was the only person in my section of the room but I know that there were other people in the room. As I was packing my belongings for my departure the next day I noticed an older man kind of hanging out watching me. He creeped me out enough that I gave him a dirty look, stopped packing, and set up a privacy curtain by tucking my blanket underneath the mattress above me (I was on the bottom bunk). I was in bed on my phone when I heard footsteps coming towards my bed. I figured he was sleeping on the bunk above me and was watching/waiting until I was finished packing for him to use the ladder and go to his bed. Instead this mother fucker pulls back the privacy curtain and asks if I want to sleep with him. Immediately I just start shouting at him \u201cWHAT DID YOU ASK ME?? WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? ARE YOU EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE IN THIS ROOM?!\u201d. He then started calling me names and asked why I \u201cstared\u201d at him if I didn\u2019t have those intentions. I told him he was a creep and immediately went to the reception to report it. I wasn\u2019t expecting to cry as I was re-telling my story to the front desk, but it was frightening. Like, what if I had been asleep?? Reception tells me that they received a noise complaint about him earlier and kicked him out of the hostel. Reception was very apologetic and understanding. But I always wonder, what if they weren\u2019t? What if they felt that my complaint wasn\u2019t severe enough to warrant his removal from the property?? \n\nAnother time at a different location, I went to check into my mixed dorm room and was making small talk with the receptionist. They then said that they were moving me to a different room since there were \u201cthree guys that liked to party\u201d in my original room and that their noise level might keep me up at night. While I believe that, I think it was a subtle way for them to tell me that they were worried about my safety. I appreciated this so much.   \n\nI\u2019ve had several hostel experiences, and all except the incident above were great. Since then, I\u2019ve made reservations for all female dorms when possible. I\u2019ve also requested the top bunk so that if someone tries to come up, I can have a higher chance of hearing them before they make their way up. It\u2019ll also make it easier for me to kick them down. \n\nWhile Airbnb\u2019s and hotels are comfortable, I think that hostels are such a great and unique way to meet people. Hopefully your experience doesn\u2019t turn you completely off from them.",

I'd already been in that room for a few days, but when they checked in, I wasn't around so they thought they had the dorm to themselves.\n\n\nAround 3:00am, they came back very drunk, and were angry that I was in \"their room\". They tried to force me to leave, and then said maybe this room was like a brothel, insinuating I was their prostitute. I was absolutely terrified, and there was no staff on site until 6:00 or 7:00am the next morning.  I pretended to be asleep, but didn't actually sleep at all that night for fear of being raped or assaulted some other way.  Thankfully they didn't put their hands on me (but did on my bed to shake it and scream in my face) , and as soon as the staff arrived on-site, I let them know what happened. \n\n\nThe hostel kicked them out immediately (they were angry at being woken up early and kicked out without a refund), and were also banned from the hostel.  I can't remember if the other hostels nearby were notified of their bad behaviour, though. (It was a small town, so they'd basically have to leave the area).\n\n\nI remember feeling taken cared for by the hostel, and ended up staying there a few more days. They got incredibly angry, offered me another room, and anything else I needed to feel safe.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, you did nothing wrong. This guy was a jerk who forced himself  into your personal space, and only backed off and he thought another man had claim on you (vs backing off when you made it clear you didn't want that).  If you feel safe and comfortable doing so, you should report them to the hostel, as they might ban them as well and notify other hostels in the area of their bad behaviour. In the end, we should all feel safe where we are staying.",

One of them came over to say something to me and put his hand on my arm (!) while I was lying in bed... nothing \"worse\" happened but it made me so uncomfortable that I was awake for hours listening to make sure no one was getting up and approaching me.\n\nAs a solo female, it always bothers me when hostels place me in a \"mixed\" dorm where I'm the *only* woman in a room with men. If I'm the only female guest in a small hostel I suppose I could understand it, but otherwise I think hostels should be more mindful of their female guests when doing room allocations. Or at least give me a heads up and offer to let me pay the difference to switch to a female dorm.",

However, I had many friends who had to deal with this shit unfortunately.\n\nTo preface my advice: you did nothing wrong and really, with this kinda stuff, it's super random and hard to predict if your spidey senses aren't telling you someone is a creep ahead of time.\n\nMy advice is like most of the other poster's advice here. Guys like this are cowardly and will wait until you're alone to strike. There were times in the hostel when the dorms were packed and it was always safer then because these guys wont risk doing anything like that with so many people around. The times you need to worry are situations like this, where it's just a few people in a big empty room. In that situation, I'd ask the front desk if you can move to a room with either: more people in it, or no people in it. If you tell them you've had issues before I can't imagine them saying no. Private rooms cost more and are usually booked, so they probably wont move you into one. Of course, if there's a female dorm, that's the best solution.\n\nReally sorry to hear you had to deal with this OP.",

I'm really sorry this happened to you and I can't tell you that I understand how it feels because it didn't happen to me. I really hope you're doing ok and never let this experience ruin your solo travels. We can be safer next time - private room/only pick hostels with women",

I was 18 years old at the time. The night was worse than I expected. They were very noisy, didn\u2019t come, into the room until 4, and when they came  in they would turn on MY bedside light not theirs. I was absolutely terrified the whole night, I stayed awake the whole night I didn\u2019t want to be caught off guard. \nThe next morning I went right to the front desk and basically in tears told them my story, they apologized and put me in an all female dorm for the remainder of my stay. They were really good about it but I expected a little more thought before they put a young girl in a room with five 45 year olds. \nOP tell the staff, this probably isn\u2019t the first time something has made a guest scared and they should try to fix it, you deserve to feel safe where you are sleeping.",

Only I was a few years older than you. I'm sure I would have been even more scared if I were 18.

I thought he was being nice at first and we were walking around the town square, then he hit on me. I politely told him I'm not gay, he apologized and left. Then later back at the hostel he hit on me again, this time more direct and to the point. I got irritated and told him I'm not interested in him in any way and don't even play for that team, so please don't talk to me. Thank god he left the next morning.

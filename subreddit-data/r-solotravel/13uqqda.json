    "postText": "Hi, it is my first time of travelling alone with a Van. I am on the road since two months and I am currently in Portugal. I was always dreaming about going to Portugal, learning the language and go surfing. But I suddenly lost the interest of doing this stuff and just want to be home again with my friends. I couldn\u2019t figure out what happened, I always loved to be on the water, to feel free and roam around and now I don\u2019t want to do anything of this anymore. Now I feel a little bit upset, like my dream always had been a lie to me and like I am giving up on all my believes, but I don\u2019t want to stay anymore. It feels a little bit like if I am quitting this now, I can\u2019t do this again any time. \nDid any one of you experienced something like this or can you give some good advices in my situation?\n\nedit: It feels a little bit like I am loosing the power to go out of the comfort zone and pushing boundaries. At the beginning of the trip things like this gave me power and made me feel strong, but now the exhaust me.",

Taking time to rest, taking time to reconnect with loved ones over the phone (or even in-person if possible) might be needed. \n\nI think it's easy when alone to put more pressure on yourself, but traveling alone doesn't mean everything's going to feel great all the time, so also giving yourself the permission to have bad days can help, rather than beating yourself up when you feel bad, which might only make you feel worse and turn into a loop/spiral of overthinking things and feeling down on yourself. I've also found that journaling during a trip can be really helpful.",

At home sometimes there are these days too, but you don\u2019t have to get along with these alone. Perhaps learning to deal with these things is part of the journey. Thank you for your words, they\u2019ve been really helpful!",

I cut a 3 month trip short to 2 months, and then another 3 month trip short to 2 months and felt like I was giving up\u2026 but I took those 2 months to go an entire new trip! Huge score! \n\nThings. Always. Change. Be open to change. \n\nMaybe your change is going home for a bit. Look at you. 2 months! Epic! I say as long as you accomplished what you set out to accomplish, beyond a time to stay, move on. Life is short.",

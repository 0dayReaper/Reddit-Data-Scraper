You'll get it the next time you come around\n\n2. Someone else mentioned the flip a coin method, which can be a good method, if you have a strong feeling when you flip thats what you want! and if you're fine with either then you can just choose the one it lands on! \nI'm honestly not a huge fan of actually doing this, especially the last step if it lands and I'm fine either way. I'd just choose the more convenient (ie less travel time) of the 2 if it gets to that.\n\n3. Research it until something comes up that leans you one way instead of the other. Sometimes you keep digging and BAM, there's the gold and you realize X was what you definitely wanted.\n\n4. Reddit it, and see what someone else says. I'm guilty of this a LOT, and it gives you a more generic plan in general, but if I ain't a sucker for a generic plan idk who i am",

One thing I try to do (on my better days, when I'm not anxiety-spiraling my way to misery) is embrace \"my vibe theory.\"\n\nI've traveled to (and lived in!) some places people absolutely love (e.g., San Diego, Seattle, and London) and, for whatever reason, the vibes were just off for me. I'm sure they're great places, and I'm sure lots of people have perfectly wonderful experiences in those places. But for whatever reason, things just did not work out for me. I couldn't find the good food, I couldn't truly relax at the coffee shops or parks, I never managed to have any magical serendipity at the bars, etc.\n\nOn the flip side, I've visited places that other people find underwhelming, unfriendly, and unremarkable...and experienced pure, unadulterated magic. I doubt other people could recreate my experiences, so I have a hard time recommending such places, but I'll always have my own magical memories.\n\nWhen making a travel choice (go out vs. stay in, hotel vs. hostel, this restaurant vs. that one, stay in the same town vs. move on, etc), it helps for me to embrace that the vibes could be excellent for some reason, or the vibes could just be off for no reason at all. It doesn't mean I chose \"wrong\"...it's just how travel works (for me, anyway). So no matter how I choose, it's ultimately up to the travel deities to bless the vibes either way \ud83d\ude02\n\nI hope this is helpful to someone else! I need to remind myself of this pretty constantly.",

It might sound harsh but your travel planning is probably not that interesting to the other people in your life. It's like discussing your plans for a big party with someone who isn't invited.\n\nPersonally I suffer from analysis paralysis a lot, and when it's really holding me back, I remind myself that *any* decision is better than no decision. And frankly I try to go by gut feel. Too often I talk myself into doing something because I feel like it's what I \"should\" do. Like hit certain \"must-sees\". Or tell myself \"it makes more *sense*\" to do this vs that. It's tempting to build my itinerary based on what \"makes the most sense\" in a logical or logistical way, but in the end, travel is about having a good time, not about making the most efficient decisions.\n\nIf I do really hit a wall and want external advice, I usually ask people (friends or the good people of r/solotravel) who have actually been to these places before, or friends of mine who are real travel nerds themselves and genuinely enjoy trip-planning and exchanging travel advice as a hobby. I wouldn't ask non-travelling friends and family for advice.",

And then when we had to wait 15-20 minutes for another passenger. \n\nI\u2019ve now had to pay extra to take me to my hotel. \n\nHe also was playing his music through his phone which was extremely annoying lol but that\u2019s not worth complaining about. Just annoyed me. \n\nBut at the same time. I\u2019ve had a 2+ hour journey for a really cheap price as it\u2019s Vietnam. \n\nI\u2019ve received poor service before, and I didn\u2019t leave a bad review because, although I feel like money wasted, these people earn next to nothing and I don\u2019t want to put them in an even worse position by putting off other customers. \n\nBut at the same time, I feel bad for people who spend their money and receive shite service. \n\nCatch 22. \n\nWhat do you guys do in these situations ?",

            "comment": "I usually leave factual reviews in a non judgmental manor.  The rating itself is judgey and I'll adjust that based on value of cost to service delivered with some consideration for location/typical expectations.\n\nExample: Bus delayed an hour, plus another 20 minutes for late passenger.  Driver played music the whole time.  Only cost $? dollars to go from A to B.  ?? stars\n\nNote that I didn't write if it was a good or bad experience, just stated the facts. This way people know what to expect.  Some might just accept the lateness for the cost.  Others might decide to hire a car instead, which can be relatively affordable in Asia.\n\nI must admit though, I took a tour in Cambodia and the guide begged us to give him a good review as jobs are so scarce.  The tour was disappointing but the guide was repeating a memorized script, so not his fault the script sucked.  He was a nice guy, spoke perfect English, and tried super hard.  So I gave the guy 5 stars--it is what it is.",

The review was actually a link from the tour group to ask about the guide but then they use the reviews on their web site too, so I had mixed feelings.  Ideally I would have given a review of the format separate from the person leading the tour, but that wasn't an option and I didn't want to risk the guy's job trying to explain they need a better script with more historical context.\n\nMy friend knew more about the Wats and their Hindu origin than the guide but she's Hindu.",

If the driving was bad, the music too loud or the bus was in poor condition, that you can complain about. \n\nBut don\u2019t complain about lateness if the issue is other passengers. It\u2019s not their fault that someone decided to turn up late to pick up. That\u2019s really outside of their control.",

(1st world was western-aligned democracies, 2nd world was Soviet-aligned communist states, and 3rd world was \"everything else\" (non-aligned and/or no coherent governing philosophy.)  The fact that 3rd-world states also happened to often be poor was a correlation, not a definition, and not always true - Switzerland and Sweden were 3rd world countries, after all.)",

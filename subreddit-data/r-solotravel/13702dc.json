I found a tour with TruTravels that works well for me but I haven\u2019t heard much about the company before. I\u2019ve traveled with G Adventures and really enjoyed it\u2026. Wondering if this company is similar. \n\nAnyone have any experience with them? What\u2019s the demographic and vibe like?",

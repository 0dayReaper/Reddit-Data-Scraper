    "postText": "For some bizarre reason, I've acquired a fascination for desolate regions - Namibia, the Australian outback, Sahara desert, Atacama etc. I spend so much time panning around these areas on Google Earth. The desolate landscapes are some of the most serene and beautiful in my opinion. \n\nI have been loosely planning out solo road trips across these regions, perhaps by buying a vehicle - either a car or motorbike - at the start destination, and selling it at the end destination. Along the way I'd either set up camp or stay in lodges where they are available. The trip would mostly be planned around where the available fuel stops are. I would plan to spend 2-3 weeks on the trip. Within reason, I don't have a budget - I'd save up to make it possible however long that takes.  \n\nI was just wondering if anyone has done something similar across remote regions? This would be my first solo trip, and I'm not sure if this is overly ambitious for someone who has barely even left their home country (the UK).",

If the conditions are rough, your luck is bad, and you don't have the right skill-set, it's not hard to accidentally kill yourself. Things can go from fine to deadly in much less time than you'd expect, especially in deserts (the story of the Death Valley Germans comes to mind). Do not fuck with deserts.",

Several international tourists die each year from doing dumb things (going walking in the middle of the day in summer, etc) or getting into routine types of trouble that aren\u2019t routine in remote places, such as car breakdowns.\n\nIf you want to travel in these types of areas, you need to know what you\u2019re doing at a pretty deep level and take a range of precautions. It\u2019s not something to jump into with no experience or plans. If you want to travel these areas, why not join a small group tour?",

I would carry a satellite phone and ensure that someone knew my route beforehand, and update that person when I am able to. \n\nEither way, I wouldn't expect to go too far off the beaten track - I really just want to experience some of the magnificent sceneries and geological formations that deserts have to offer.",

Even Australians get lost quite regularly (and don't make it home). If you're going to do it, don't do it alone. I'm sorry for not being more supportive, but I really wouldn't recommend it, especially when you haven't really left the UK. These places are next level remote. \n\nAs a European, I can totally relate to not quite grasping how big Australia is and not really being used to the danger of being alone and far away from everyone and everything, but I promise you, it can be really dangerous. It's fine if you know what you're doing and you're well prepared and everything. I'd definitely make sure you at least prepare properly.",

Do Aussies not often head inland on vacation to visit such sights?\n\nMaybe my definition of \"desolate\" is a bit vague, I suppose I was thinking of something like a solo road trip from Adelaide to Darwin over two weeks, with some short detours throughout for Litchfield, Katherine Gorge etc. \n\nI'd of course spend a long time preparing, carry a satellite phone and make people aware of my route &amp; contact them at regular intervals. I still imagine it can be quite stressful as a solo traveller, in the instance that your vehicle breaks down on an isolated stretch of road.",

You can spend months reading up about a destination and how to prepare, but there will always be blind spots that you don't realize until you get there. In a very desolate and remote area, a small \"whoopsie\" becomes fatal.\n\nIf you were wanting to go tomorrow, it'd be a bad idea but if you want to work your way up to doing it in a few years, then it's feasible",

It's not for everyone - it takes a toll physically and mentally to be away from basic comforts for an extended period of time - but if you have a taste for that kind of holiday, you'll absolutely love it. \n\nMy suggestion would be to start small to test waters out. Even if you do end up thriving in that kind of a holiday, there are plenty of logistics you'll need to get used to and anticipate. There are many desolate spots in the UK as well as in the EU to prime yourself with before graduating to Namibia, the Outback, the Sahara, and Atacama. Try a walking tour through the Alps or a self drive through Iceland perhaps or Lapland perhaps.",

            "comment": "A 3 week motorcycle ride in Vietnam might scratch that itch.  Concentrate on the northwest to avoid the tourist ground zero that the Ha Giang Loop has become.  Ride north, then west, loop down to hit the Phong Nha to Khe Sanh ride along the Laos border.  You will not see another tourist and you will see few locals on most of that ride.  Pack a lightweight hammock setup.  I use a Warbonnet Blackbird XLC, a lightweight tarp, and a down quilt.  Wild camp when the mood strikes.  There are some pretty inviting desolate areas where you could stash your bike and hike/wild camp.\n\nAnother possibility is to go to the US and hike the Appalachian Trail for a few weeks.  It can be a pretty solitary experience if you avoid overnighting at the shelters and build your distance and camping spots around water availability.  You can wild camp on almost all of the southern half of the AT.  Once again, a hammock is much better than a tent because you can hammock almost anywhere/",

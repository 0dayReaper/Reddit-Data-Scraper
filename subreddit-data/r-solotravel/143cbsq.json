    "postText": "I'm planning a trip to Colombia at the end of the summer and would like your opinion on my itinerary. I've traveled in groups before (Peru, Spain, USA) but this is my first solo trip and first time in Colombia. Please let me know if this is too much, if there is room for more or if I'm missing any 'must see' places. Some stuff is dependent on the weather so I might have to move a few things around but this is my current plan for the trip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 1: Overnight flight to Medellin.\n\nDay 2: Arrive in Medellin in the morning, visit El Pablodo neighborhood, sleep in Medellin.\n\nDay 3: Downtown Medellin, Comuna 13, sunset on a rooftop patio, sleep in Medellin.\n\nDay 4: Bus to Guatape, Piedra Del Oenol, Plaza del Zacalo, sleep in Guatape.\n\nDay 5: Waterfront, Calle del Recuerdo, La Casuela waterfall, bus back to Medellin\n\nDay 6: Fly to Santa Marta, walk around the city, Museo del Oro, Simon Bolivar Museum, beach, sleep in Santa Marta\n\nDay 7: Bus to Minca, walk around the city, sleep in Minca.\n\nDay 8: Visit La Victoria coffee farm, beer and sunset at Casas Viejas hostel, sleep in Minca.\n\nDay 9: Hike the Los Pinos Trail, sleep in Minca\n\nDay 10: Bus back to Santa Marta, hike beach or walk around Santa Marta/Taganda, sleep in Santa Marta\n\nDay 11: Bus to Tayrona National Park, hike, beach, sleep in or around the park.\n\nDay 12: Bus back to Santa Marta and fly back home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is some flexibility around Santa Marta and Tayrona national Park as I am not the type of person to spend a full day laying on a beach. I am considering going directly from Minca to Tayrona National park and sleeping there instead of Santa Marta to be closer in the morning. I am was originally planning on flying to Bogota but that would've given me less time in Medellin or Minca. I am also skipping Cartagena (sadly) simply because I don't have enough time and that would add another flight/bus.\n\nPlease let me know what you think.",

            "comment": "Hey! We spent 6 months traveling around Colombia so maybe we can help. Looks good overall.In Guatape another option is Cristalina waterfall which is closer to Guatape and just as off the beaten track, and part of a 7km round trip hike. La casuela is a 45min drive away and closer to San Rafael. This [article](https://halfdigitalnomad.com/things-to-do-in-guatape-piedra-del-penol/) covers a good chunk of what we did and found to be great options to do there.\n\nYou could also take night buses instead of flying which help to save time on short trips. The good bus companies are quite luxurious with ac and seats that go far back.Our favorite place in Colombia is San Gil, which is the adventure capital and place to go if you\u2019re into paragliding, whitewater rafting, caving, rapelling waterfalls. We\u2019ve been there twice and itching to go back. Some recommendations found [here](https://www.facebook.com/Guatelaria)\n\nGiven your short trip, unless you enjoy cities or want to party in Taganga you probably don\u2019t need too much time in Santa Marta. It is nice if you\u2019re into scuba diving though, one of the best (and cheapest) places to do your PADI certificationYour day 7 seems a bit empty as Minca is only an hour away from Santa Marta and town itself is fairly small for walking around. So maybe you can save a day here and add something else in? Highly recommend [Minca](https://halfdigitalnomad.com/top-things-to-do-in-minca-adventure-guide/) overall though.  \n\n\nSome other options nearby would be Palomino(beaches and surfing) or Ciudad Perdida (lost city hike minimum 3 days) depending on your interests.\n\nTayrona is really cool but it\u2019s been getting more popular with tourists lately so I\u2019m scared to go back as it may ruin my impression.\n\nHope these help!",

            "comment": "Looks good! \n\nLoved medellin, would advice to do a free walking tour in down town so you get to understand the place since it might be a little rough. If you decide to skip the walking tour, make sure to go to down town in the middle of the day since I heared when I was there that it will be deserted when all the businesses close and its not a good place to find yourself especially alone at that time. During the day it felt fine. Also stay in Los Patios hostel since you want a rooftop and they have a great one with parties. Last, don't miss the cable cars as public transport.\n\nAs for tayrona; I thought it was overhyped and didn't hear too many good things about santa marta. Might be worth looking into Palomino which I loved.\n\nHave fun!",

I\u2019ll try to fit in the cable car but from what I\u2019ve seen, you can end up waiting a lot depending when you take it. For the hostel, I looked at Los Patios but it\u2019s a lot more expensive compared to others. Yolo hostel seems to be people\u2019s main recommendation.\n\nSanta Marta seems to have mixed reviews but many people talk about Taganda which is about 15 minutes from Santa Marta. I\u2019m mostly going there to access Minca and Tayrona National park. I\u2019ll look into Palomino",

I think they also have a Communa 13 tour, but I went with another company my hostel recommended. \n\nDepending on sunset times, I would 100% recommend checking out some of the bars in Communa 13 for the sunset. The view of the city is amazing up there and some of the bars are like tiny, little open air clubs that only run until 8PM. When O go back to Medellin I plan on spending a lot more time in the Communa!",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\nWarning this is a huge post\u2026 I\u2019m heading overseas solo for around 5 months. Coming from Australia I want to make the most of this trip as I likely won\u2019t ever have the money or the time off to take another extended trip like this one. I\u2019m looking for feedback on my itinerary below &amp; my budget. Please note:\n\n- Because I\u2019m going in high season I have booked all accommodation for the first 90 days (all of Portugal, Spain, Italy). These all have free cancellation so able to change if I want to.\n\n- Everything from Albania onwards is just a rough idea\n\n- I have booked major transport (i.e. flights)\n\n- I will be using buses &amp; trains for all other transport throughout\n\n\n\nITINERARY\n\n\nMorocco:\n\n- G adventures tour (14 days)\n- fly marrakech to porto \n\n\nPortugal: \n- porto (4 nights)\n- Lisbon (4 nights)\n- Lagos (4 nights)\n\n\nSpain:\n- seville (4 nights)\n- Granada (4 nights)\n- Fly granada to mallorca\n- Soller (5 nights)\n- Cala d\u2019or (6 nights)\n- Palma (2 nights)\n- Fly palma to venice\n\n\nItaly:\n- venice (1 night)\n- Cortina d\u2019ampezzo (4 nights)\n- Ortisei (5 nights)\n- Siena (5 nights)\n- Atrani (6 nights)\n- Tropea (4 nights)\n- Cefalu (4 nights)\n- Palermo (6 nights)\n- Castelmola (5 nights)\n- Fly catania to bari\n- Bari (1 night)\n- Matera (3 nights)\n- Monopoli (6 nights)\n- Otranto (5 nights\n- Ferry Brindisi to Vlore\n\n\nAlbania:\n- Vlore \n- Himare, Sarande\n- Gjirokaster\n- Berat\n- Tirana\n- Shkoder \n\n\nMontenegro:\n- Budva?\n- Kotor \n- Zabljak \n\n\nBosnia:\n- Mostar \n- Sarajevo \n\n\nSerbia:\n- belgrade\n- Pirot\n\n\nBulgaria:\n- sofia \n- Rilas mountains\n- Burgas?\n\n\nTurkey:\n- Honestly i probably won\u2019t have the time/money to make it this far\n\n\nBUDGET\n\n\nMy total budget is $25,000 AUD (approx 15,500 euro). I have booked all flights &amp; accommodation (mix of hostels &amp; airbnbs) for the first 3 months already. This cost a total of $11,000 AUD) which leaves me with $14000 AUD (8640 euro) for the remaining expenses over the 5 months. Averaged out this is $90 AUD per day (55 euro per day). Keeping in mind that the first 3 months I only have to pay for food &amp; activities, and the last 2 months will be eastern europe in shoulder season. I plan on cooking myself most nights and not drinking much. I just haven\u2019t been to europe in a while so don\u2019t have a gauge on prices over there - is this budget doable?!?! \n\n\nMy main questions:\n- Is my budget realistic? Am I going to be shocked when I run out of money earlier than expected? \n\n- likewise is my itinerary realistic? I don\u2019t want to be too rushed but also want to fit in as much as possible\n\n- Am I doing anything ludicrously stupid? In terms of both itinerary and budget\n\n- Any suggestions on good hiking spots? And nice beaches? Being outdoorsy in nature is my most favourite thing\n\n- solo-friendly but not party hostel recommendations for eastern europe please!!\n\n- Any other recommendations of must-see or must-do things? \n\nThanks if you actually read all this, i appreciate any feedback/recommendations \ud83e\udd17\n\nEDIT: I have been to major attractions in Europe before (e.g. Paris, Rome, Venice, Florence, Athens, Greek islands, etc). While it was 10+ years ago that I went, I\u2019m not looking to revisit these cities this trip. My bad, probs should\u2019ve mentioned that earlier.",

I\u2019m planning to be as frugal as possible the first 3 months to (hopefully) give me some leeway for months 4 &amp; 5. Or atleast give me a gauge to see if I\u2019ll need to end my trip earlier than planned. Appreciate the feedback!",

The part you your trip you have not payed yet, is the cheapest one. Portugal you can easily eat for less then 6\u20ac,(I can let you know, some places), transport is affordableI just spent 20 days in Italy, and was pretty reasonable as well, maybe around 25% more than Portugal all around. The second half is even more affordable than Portugal. I\u2019d say you imagine this in Australia and discount to like 50% due to economies difference of the countries your going to travel to.\nHappy travel!",

Obviously you could spend 2 weeks just in any of those cities but Granada for example I think 2 days is the perfect amount of time (not counting travel days).",

Next day you can ride a ferry back to Shkodar. (There are two good hostels in Shkodar, one is called Wanderes Hostel, forgot the other\u2019s name) they can organize transport and you can store your luggage there)",

Or rather any chill beachy places in Spain instead?\n\nHelpful suggestions thankyou! Definitely keen for the valbona to theth hike. Did you arrange the guesthouses in valbona &amp; theth yourself or through the hostel?",

If so you\u2019ll have a blast around Soller \u2014 there are so many amazing mountain towns, hikes and beaches in the Sierra Tramuntana range. If you don\u2019t have a car \u2014 definitely recommend exploring Deia and Fornalutx, and I think you can hike there from Soller and then take a bus back or something. \n\nYou could cut Cala D\u2019or down a few days unless you\u2019re really wanting to relax on the beach for 6 full days. And if you are \u2014 there are definitely cheaper places to relax on the beach than Mallorca. But I\u2019m sure it will be incredible either way!",

Most people I met on the trail booked it through the hostels and just walked in without reservations. Can recommend \u201eShpella Guesthouse\u201c in Theth and \u201eVillas Jezerca\u201c.

Bulgaria is very tricky to navigate if you can't read cyrillic, at least outside of Sofia and Varna. Personally, I would skip Vlore and instead ferry from Italy to somewhere in Croatia, it's easier for beginners. OR fly from Italy to Athens and take the 8 hour incredibly scenic bus to Saranda OR fly to Corfu and take the ferry there.\n\nAlso, the Balkans are not Eastern Europe (except Bulgaria). Locals will correct you on this. \n\nIf you've traveled solo extensively before, then you will spend much less money in the Balkans--make sure to get a Balkans Best brochure, if you go to their listed hostels (which are all quite social), you'll get discounts!\n\nYour budget is fine though I think. What I will say is that Western Europe during the summer is a bit of a crowded nightmare so I'm not sure what you're looking for with beaches.",

I am a student but I noticed that in most places if you say you are a student they wouldn't even ask for a student ID ir something. I eat cheap supermarket food like Lidl salads and I just walk everywhere. In most places you could just not pay for public transport and no one is going to say anything to you, but I think that's not morally correct. For travelling between cities buses are usually the cheapest option. And finally, websites like Booking have usually promotions on hostels.",

Sounds a bit trollish though \ud83d\ude00 I mean you\u2019re going slightly off the beaten path which is good, but only if you have already seen the major tourist attractions in Europe. Returning from a 5 months trip in Europe and not having been to Rome, Madrid or Barcelona, Amsterdam, London, Vienna, literally any place in the huge France, \u2026\n\nAnyways I will just give my 2 cents on Italy having visited a bit (also helps that I\u2019m Italian). Venice 1 night is a pity. It is expensive but consider 3 days maybe if you want to see it. \nGood that you don\u2019t stay in Bari as it\u2019s not a nice tourist place. Otranto seems a bit too much. Puglia is amazing but if you plan on staying put in Otranto maybe consider reducing the days. Same thing for Monopoli and castelmola. (Disclaimer: I haven\u2019t been to these 2 but they are small towns picturesque and all but limited. Maybe the best thing is to rent a car for these places so you\u2019re not \u201cstuck\u201d in a small town but keep it as base and can explore the surroundings like Taormina.)\nAlso why not throw in Rome on the way from Siena? Sure it\u2019s hot as hell in summer but there\u2019s so much to see only of antiquity it\u2019s a pity to skip imo. Also Pisa (yeah sure leaning tower all touristy but why not)\n\nAlbania I can\u2019t say anything as I\u2019ve never been but I would personally take the ferry to Greece instead (just because I love Greece and can\u2019t get enough of it).\n\nEdit: also being so Balkan-centric and skipping Croatia is criminal",

E.g. day trips to alberobello, lecce, etc. is this viable? Renting a car is not really an option due to cost unfortunately. \n\nAnd I agree it is criminal! My initial plan was to go from Italy to Croatia, until Croatia became part of the Schengen zone\u2026 I just don\u2019t have enough time to fit croatia (or greece for that matter) into the 90 days sadly.\n\nThanks for the detailed feedback, really appreciate it!",

Selva val Gardena is so lovely (lots of different hiking options), and Alpe di Siusi is a fairy tale. There are great hikes in Zabljak and Shkod\u00ebr as well (as others have already told you - the Theth-Valbon\u00eb is a classic). There are also nice hikes in Kosovo (but remember to plan your trip - officially, you can't go to Serbia after being to Kosovo). \n\nI don't know Monopoli personally, but I remember reading that it's not terribly interesting when I planned my Puglia trip (it might have changed in the meantime). Otranto is beautiful, and so is Gallipoli and Lecce - but not much happens in the area so 11 nights there may be a bit much. I think I'd squeeze that bit - and perhaps add some days in either Switzerland (Appenzell is the most beautiful place you can imagine) - or go to the Azores for a couple of days. Both places will give you extraordinary nature and hiking - and unfortunately, neither place is cheap (especially not Switzerland). I really think it would be worth it, though - especially since you're not likely to be back for a while. But no matter what you decide I'm sure you'll have a great trip!",

Great cliffside hiking in Lagos and where Benagil Cave is. Praia do Camilo was my favorite beach, in Lagos. Ton of stairs to get done, but there is a separate section through a little tunnel in the rocks that was nice and secluded. \n\nEven if you have been to Venice, I'd either add at least one night so you can actually do and see things or skip it all together. Is the hassle of traveling there and staying just one night worth it for only a couple hours to actually do or see things? Or would your time be better spent going directly to your next destination?\n\nGo to Burano, about 45 min vaporetto ride from Venice, if you didn't go on your previous trip to Venice. Cute little island known for it's lace and colorful rows of houses, was a lot of fun just walking around, seeing the colors and canals. But go in the morning before it gets too crowded.",

            "comment": "I traveled for about 4 months solo through Europe. At most my accommodation was 2 weeks out booked and I only came across issues with cities like Barcelona in finding a cheaper hostel or AirBnb.\n\nLots of great locations on your list, but I feel some are a bit longer than needed. Sienna won't need 5 days for sure. Coimbra was probably my favourite city in Portugal. If you haven't been to Sorrento and Pompeii, I would recommend those for sure.\n\nBiggest thing I can recommend around Spain, Portugal and possibly some other countries is using BlaBlaCar. Ride sharing saved me quite some money over trains, though it could be difficult to find rides sometimes.\n\nFood wise:\n\n\\- Portugal: Francesinha, Bacalhau, all the Pastel de Natas you can eat\n\n\\- Spain: Solo just sucks for tapas, what you want to look for is Pinchos instead\n\n\\- Italy: Don't feel bad about the carb overdosing, it's all worth it while you are there",

All that is taken care off as well with that budget?  Because that will take a lot in addition to transportation inside the city (bus/metro/taxi/renting scooter) then food, drinks, museum/attraction, then just shit going down. \n\nCheck out Blablacar- way to share rides with people between cities. Have saved me some money and is interesting.",

This includes my flights to Europe (970 euros), my tour in morocco (850 euro), and major transport (flights between countries). My spending on accommodation only for the first 90 days averages out to 50 euros per night. Though even this surprised me as I wasn\u2019t expecting hostels to be so expensive! \n\nYeah I\u2019m not a huge drinker and happy to cook for myself. So i think transport &amp; attractions/experiences will be a big factor. I\u2019ll check out blablacar for sure thanks!",

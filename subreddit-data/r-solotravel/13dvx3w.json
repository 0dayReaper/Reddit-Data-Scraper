    "postText": "The situation is as follows. I have an outgoing flight to spain on the 15th of June, returning 20th of June purchased via skyscanner. I now want to go a bit earlier than the 15th and have found a cheap outbound single ticket. Can I buy that ticket and then use the other ticket I had already bought to fly back? (meaning I would miss the outbound flight on the 15th) or would doing that void my return ticket? Not sure how it all works",

So no, you can't use just the return.\n\nYou can, in some circumstances, use only the outbound. But as soon as you miss a leg, the rest of the ticket is nul and void.\n\nTry seeing what the change fee would be to change the outbound date on your original ticket. It's probably cheaper than buying a new round-trip.",

If you don't use a one-way ticket, it generally has no effect on other one-way tickets (unless you're a habitual no-shower and the airline flags you).",

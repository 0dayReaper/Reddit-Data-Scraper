But I'm looking to travel Italy sometime next year for about a month or 2, which will be my first trip longer than 2 weeks. \n\nAny advice regarding booking of accommodation? Is it possible to just book the first hostel before the trip and start looking for other hostels when I'm ready to move on to another place?",

In the past I used to always book everything last minute and not plan, but this year I'm planning a few months in advance.\n\nI just got back from Italy which I booked at the beginning of February. When I  booked my hostel it was \u20ac60 a night and then about two weeks before my trip I checked the price and it had gone up to \u20ac100 a night and that was for an 8 bed dorm room. I'd recommend booking with free cancellation anyway incase your plans change.",

(subject to season) \n\nIt sounds more exciting to travel this way and it makes for a cooler story to tell, but this is where you have to be honest with yourself. Are you the worrier/anxious type or the happy go lucky type?\n\nI'm still planning my european trip and I've found that the pricing structure there penalizes spontaneous/last minute planning individuals with higher prices (accomodation and transpo). \n\nI wanted it to be a do whatever go wherever whenever and quickly realized that I would need to pay a premium to experience that; so far i've booked 50% of my 3 month trip. I'm going during shoulder season, too.\n\nIf you have the money, do it.",

Some cities I've decided to skip like Brussels b/c it looks boring. Ghent seems to be a good mix of Bruges and Brussels minus the Atomium (I don't see what big deal is, personally). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI Google 3,4,5,7 day itineraries to give me a rough estimate and compare them using different websites then use google maps to give a realistic time of travel. I then put the stuff I want to see on a spreadsheet with no actual time when to go unless I need a reservation. For example, in Dublin, I need to buy reserved tickets for a certain time slot for the Guinness tour and......some prison. Based on any Internet itinerary I automatically add one day to give me more breathing room. sometimes I just want to stare at nothing, ya know? or just stay in the hostel and watch nflx.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now I'm researching Switzerland (7/8 weeks in) and so far have extended my 5 day trip to 10 days and I'm only staying in the Jungfrau region (tons to see and do); might make a day trip to Lucerne...iunno..maybe make a 2 day trip to Zermatt. I'm big on hiking, though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also reflect back on my previous travels in other countries and take into account what kind of stuff I actually liked/remember; it's easy to fall into other ppl's \"you should see this and this and this and this.\"  I'm not that big into museums....so I'll only hit up the popular European ones and skip the rest. I might skip Florence (around week 8/9) because I don't care about a statue and the architecture of Europe is going to start melting together by that point anyway (what others have said on the Internet and in person).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's important to find a youtuber who give you both sides of the story..the good and bad. A lot of vloggers basically present the same message \"everything is great all of the time and everything is delicious; come here! click on my stuff\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood Youtuber for European transpo: \"Planes, Trains, Everything\"\n\nGood Youtuber for walking tours/good/bad: \"Wolters World\", \"Camden David\", \"BookingHunterTV\", \"Rok Goes Around\"\n\nGood youtuber showing exactly where to get local Sims: \"Traveltomtom\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnly because I'm currently researching this area; youtubers for Switzerland: \"The Traveling Swiss \u2013 Alexis &amp; Louis\" &amp; \"Aplins in the Alps\"; they are all you need for this country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps!",

            "comment": "This question has many variables. This response is based on a frequent traveler who lives in the west coast of the US. \n - Domestic flights are booked 3-4 months out. I typically use a flight tracker if it\u2019s a new destination. But, if it\u2019s a regular destination (i.e. see family), I know what a decent price is and will book if it\u2019s cheap. If not I\u2019ll track for a few weeks to see if it drops. \n - International flights are typically booked 5-6 months in advance. But for me it\u2019s all based on price, which airline, dates, weather, and when I want to travel. If I want to go to France, I\u2019ll start planning a year in advance to know what the weather is seasonally, when is the cheapest or best time to go, what are average flight prices, make sure I avoid national holidays, etc. But, if I narrowed down my dates and after tracking flights they\u2019re too expensive, I\u2019ll wait a few weeks. If they\u2019re still too expensive, I scrap that country and book a vacation elsewhere. \n - International regional flights (i.e. Paris to Rome). I book these about one month before. Sooner if you can and know your dates are locked in. These flights can be very cheap when booked ahead. But, they also come with major restrictions, so you want to ensure you do your research ahead of time. \n\nBut, be mindful of your life. It might make sense to book international flights 6 months ahead, but if you have kids, aging parents, work obligations, family commitments, etc. it might make sense to book closer to when you want to leave to ensure nothing gets in the way. Spending a few hundred more on a flight might be worth it vs having to change plans or flights last minute.",

            "comment": "the tldr is it's really complicated and you'd need to know how busy areas will be at certain times of the year.\n\nFor example you mentioned italy, right now italy for the entire summer bookings are fucked. Prices have all been raised, everyone is traveling, and would be impossible to book last minute (i was booking july 14-30th and having an insanely miserable time) \n\nTraveling is booming now that covid restrictions are lifted, and the things you're weighing against each other are flexibility vs cost/potentially having no place to stay. Not a worthwhile trade for the vast majority of people.\n\nOther places can be far more doable last minute or week before, especially during off season, but it's still a possibility you could end up not being able to stay where you want if it all ends up booked up.",

            "comment": "I always book 2 nights max in my chosen hotel/hostal. If i dont like it (place is dirty, noisy, in a bad neighbourhood etc) then i find somewhere else after 2 nights. If i like it, then i renew for more days.\n\nI had a bad experience with a private apartment last year - brand new apartment and yet, it had no internet! And no guests were allowed into the building so i couldnt invite my gf. Toilet didnt flush. I was told that i need to pay $10 everytime i use the washing machine. Landlord stopped replying to my wattsapp messages the day i checked in. I booked for a week and the landlord refused to refund me money for unused nights cos it was unliveable.\nAlso, the scumbag refused to refund me the cash deposit which i had to pay when i checked in. \nI wrote a brutually honest review on booking.com and the place is no longer listed there.\n\nSo, my lessons learnt from this are :\n\n- avoid privately owned accomodation, even if listed on booking.com. Thus i am reluctant with abnb too.\n\n- never use accomodation where i need to pay a cash deposit at check in.",

It helps if you aren't too fussy and are open to any sort of accommodation. In some places where there aren't many hostels it can be cheaper to stay at a family run BnB (not AirBnb).\n\nI haven't been to Europe post COVID so I'm really curious if it is hard as everyone says. But previously I've always been able to find something even when the usual websites have had nothing in peak times. Need to be resourceful sometimes!\n\nMight be a case of learning as you go. Book some places with free cancellation in advance for back up and keep an eye on availability. If you aren't having trouble getting a bed then you don't need to keep booking in advance anymore.",

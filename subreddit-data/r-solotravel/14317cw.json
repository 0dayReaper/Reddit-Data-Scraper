            "comment": "Perfume Pagoda and Temple of Literature would not be even close to making the cut if I were staying 3 days in Hanoi.  The Museum of Ethnology, Women's Museum, Hoa Lo Prison (close to the Women's Museum and both very near Hoan Kiem Lake) are all more interesting to most people.  Early morning and evenings are great times to walk a few laps around Hoan Kiem Lake.  Talk to locals.  Hanoians are surprisingly friendly.  \n\nEat street food at the little places which serve on the sidewalk and have those little plastic stools.  Try bun rieu, banh cuon, and nem.  Hanoi is full of cool little coffee shops.  I recommend Hanoi Family Homestay 2 for lodging.  You will really be taken care of there.\n\nHaving a suit made in Hoi An?  Honestly, I have never had this done and I have my doubts about the quality.  I know this space because I make my living as a liquidator of several US clothing brands.  I was not impressed by the lining that a big Hoi An tailor was using in suits.  The bolts of fabric that I saw were knockoffs with misspelled company names, like \"Loro Piono\" instead of \"Loro Piana\".  So know what you are getting.  That said, I am tempted to have a linen suit made there on my next trip.  Make sure that you know exactly what styling details you want.  If you are getting a business suit you want US style or Italian style, not Vietnamese style.  And for the love of humanity, don't get a black suit unless you are a funeral director.\n\nAnother poster noted that the trip is too short for some places.  Well, it is a very short trip and possibly your introduction to Vietnam.  My first trip to Indochina was quick travel, 6 weeks to catch Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand.  That allowed me to determine where I wanted to spend a lot of time on later trips (Hanoi, Kon Tum, Siem Reap) and determine which places did not click with me (HCMC, Danang, Thailand).  So enjoy this taste of Vietnam and if you like it hopefully you can schedule a more immersive trip in the future.",

If you have and it didn\u2019t interest you then fair enough, but just be prepared that many travelers you\u2019ll meet will describe it as the highlight of their Vietnam trip and you may feel the FOMO. I hadn\u2019t planned on doing it when I arrived but was convinced after hearing all the positive reviews. And FWIW I agree that it was the highlight of my trip.\n\nAs far as learning to ride a motorbike, I personally would be afraid to drive in the big cities even if I was an expert motorbike rider because I don\u2019t understand how the traffic works. But if you\u2019re very brave I think it would be a cool experience",

The last trip I did was backpacking from Paris\u2014&gt;Istanbul and while that was amazing, it wasn\u2019t as nature heavy until I got into the Balkans so I was hoping to at some point in Vietnam hop on a bike and get to seeing more of it without relying on busses. I may have to skip out on the more central cities and stick to the north if I want to do it though",

So doable, just depends on what you want to prioritize. I don\u2019t know much about Tam Coc so I can\u2019t really weigh in, but I will say that I wanted to leave Hanoi city proper pretty quick\u2014 it stressed me out haha. So Ha Giang loop was a good getaway.",

Because you will need at least 4 hours travel from Ninh Binh to Cat Ba, which will take all day 17th, and you will probably leave early morning the 19th for Hoi An. \n\nWould recommend 0 days in Da Nang , just visit what you need and stay in Hoi An, it is 30 min from Da Nang, you can drive a scooter or take a taxi there, it will be cheap (&gt;5$). Which means you can get to Hoi An 1 day later, and extend one day in Cat Ba for example. \n\nHanoi is better Friday - Sunday with the night market and events, maybe consider doing Cat Bat/Ninh Binh first.",

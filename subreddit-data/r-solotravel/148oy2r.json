    "postText": "Hello r/solotravel,\n\nI'm planning a trip to Singapore and Thailand. I'll be between those two countries for the month of July. I am looking to utilize a **data-only** eSIM plan to stay connected without the high fees from my US-based carrier.\n\nBlame it on my lack of international travel (and/or being a dense American), but I'm very confused by this whole eSIM thing. I know that I'm way overcomplicating this in my mind. I'm hoping some of you have experience using eSIMs while traveling internationally and can help answer a few questions:\n\n1. What happens if someone texts / iMessages my US-based number? Will I be able to respond? And if so, from what number will it come? Does it matter if SMS text message versus iMessage?\n2. Same question except for calls / FaceTime.\n3. What steps do I need to take to avoid charges from my US-based carrier and am only utilizing the eSIM purchased?\n4. I assume that all apps (e.g., google maps, google translate, instagram, etc.) can be used via the eSIM?\n5. What providers do you recommend? Initially, I'd intended to use Airalo, but it seems they've \"sold out\" for Singapore. So now I could use Airalo for Thailand, but find a different provider for Singapore. Although, ideally, I'd have one provider that I start using in Singapore (first destination) and then that works just the same when I land in Thailand.\n6. To maximize the data purchased, I'd plan to utilize wifi when possible. Is it as simple as just connecting to WiFi to override the eSIM plan?\n7. What blind spots am I missing here? I can confirm that my iPhone is eSIM compatible and that it is unlocked. However, surely there's something I'm missing.\n\nThanks in advance for any tips and advice you can offer on using eSIMs while traveling abroad. Your help is much appreciated!",

            "comment": "You just use the E-Sim to have mobile data. Everything else is totally unaffected by that. It's basically just like turning WiFi on or off. E-Sims from Airalo or many other providers are purely for data, they don't even have a phone number associated with them and you can't make phone calls or receive SMS through them. Even if you could, every phone allows you to set up standard settings for every Sim card which function should or should not be used by which Sim card.",

            "comment": "I've used eSims in the USA, Turkey, the Balkans and SE Asia so its become a little routine for me now.\n\n1) if its a data-only eSim you're likely to not get a local number with it. regardless, an eSim with a number, your friend/family would need that number to text you and get charged for texting a foreign number. As long as its an iMessage its fine.  \n2) the same, calls wont work but Facetime/Whatsapp calls should. \n\n3) (Assuming youre on iPhone), make sure you go to Settings -&gt; Mobile Data -&gt; set your eSim as your Mobile Data and turn off Mobile Data Switching. You can also turn off your home sim Data Roaming here. If you want your friends/family to contact you though dont turn the line off, keep it on.\n\n4) yes, think of it as just having another data source, like wifi or something.\n\n5) I've used Airalo for Turkey and it was fantastic value for money and very seamless. But I generally shop around for the cheapest and most suitable deal. Checkout esimdb which is like an esim comparison site.\n\n6) Yes.\n\n7) No if youre iPhone is eSim compatible it kinda really is as easy as that. Most eSim sellers will give you very clear instructions on set up. Once you have your secondary eSim then you will see that your iPhone has two mobile signal bars as opposed to just one (they'll be stacked on top of each other!)",

In other words, if I send an iMessage will the recipient receive it as if they received it from me when I was in the US. Similarly, someone can just send me an iMessage as they would if I were in the US?\n\nSaid another way--all will look the same to senders and receivers of iMessages to / from me while I'm away and utilizing an eSIM?",

It just automatically takes over when I land to both countries I\u2019m traveling to. And, I get both data (I.e., internet), voice, and text. So in other words, I can use my phone just as I use it in the US. \n\nSo while slightly more expensive, it seems the product is more convenient. Thus, I may go that route unless people have criticisms that are NOT price related. For example, the coverage speed is slow.",

People can still send you texts and they just bank up and all come through at once when you put the home sim back in. So it's best to use purely data based communications like whatsapp, Facebook messenger, discord etc that don't need to be associated with a phone number.",

As SIM card (with plenty of mobile data) in Southeast Asia countries are so much cheaper than other parts of the world. \n\nIf you\u2019re arriving in Singapore, you may check out Singtel (one of the local telcos)\u2018s hi!Tourist SIM card (approx US$22 for 100GB of data for 28 days and include data roam in Thailand).",

You can set this up before you leave. You can buy a multi-year plan from a big provider for about $2-3/month.\n\nI wish you a fantastic trip with the most delicious food! If you're in Chiang Mai, try to take a trip out to the Sticky Waterfalls.",

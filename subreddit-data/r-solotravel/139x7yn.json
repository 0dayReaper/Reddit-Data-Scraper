    "postText": "I want to travel to Bolivia (hopefully around October-December) to visit a very good friend of mine that lives there. But first, I need to get a visa. From all the research that I\u2019ve done, it seems that you have to already have proof that you have arranged accommodation and purchased a round trip flight (or a flight leaving the country) in order to apply for a visa to get there in the first place!? This seems incredibly counter-intuitive to me and makes everything much more complicated than it needs to be. \n\nI have a very important question for those who have gotten a Bolivian visa and traveled there already:\n\n\u2022 Would it be possible for me to simply purchase hotel accommodations and a round-trip flight to Bolivia now so that I can then apply for the visa, even if I may have to cancel these after getting the visa? \n\nI know it might be wasting money, but I really am serious about making this trip one way or another, and I\u2019d be willing to do it if necessary. I don\u2019t want to have to wait until too close to time to apply, and then my visa not arrive in time. \n\nI\u2019ve scoured the internet and can\u2019t find much useful information. \n\nAny help is really appreciated.",

            "comment": "My girlfriend from Kenya used to have this problem all the time, but not specifically in Bolivia.   She would just book cancelable flights and accommodations and cancel if needed.  They usually aren't very strict if you have a US visa.  We did have some racism issues crossing borders in latin America though. If you are not white or Latina (e.g. african), you may get hassled/forced to pay bribes if walking or driving across borders.  Airports are typically safe.",

They made us show proof of when we were leaving (I bought a fake ticket with onward and it worked fine) and the hotel we were staying at.  It takes a little longer than normal customs, but it is fine.  It helps if you have those things printed, but we didn't and they just took a picture of the info from our phones.  Hope this helps, let me know if you have other questions.",

It sucks for one way travelers like myself, but it's quite reasonable. Maybe thinking outside your own perspective would be helpful before calling things overcomplicated or unnecessary.\n\nYou can always buy a refundable ticket then return, or use one of the many onward ticket websites for a cost. Bolivia requires a handful of other requirements as well, and having them printed out would be very helpful. I'd make sure you do your research as I've heard some horror stories trying to get into Bolivia.",

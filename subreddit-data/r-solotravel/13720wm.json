    "postText": "Hello this is my second day soloing Italy and I absolutely love it, unfortunately I didn\u2019t plan ahead and ended up stranded in Bergamo Italy.\n\nI took the train from Milan to Bergamo and tried to figure out how to get on the right bus route for my B&amp;B (30 min drive from station)\n\nSo I ended up killing some time after the train and walking around because I thought I knew the bus to take (line 7)\n\nTurns out there\u2019s Line 7 blue bus, line 7 a &amp; line 7 b. So I of course jumped on every single wrong bus and ended up so disoriented.\n\nThis whole time I don\u2019t have internet as I don\u2019t have an Italian sim and the free Wi-Fi they offer has to be confirmed with an SMS message which I cannot do\n\nAfter many attempts at trying to figure out the right bus I finally tried to call a taxi off of DHL land line, got put on hold and then told no taxis were available \n\nAt this point I\u2019m close to giving up, I\u2019ve been carrying around two over packed bags, I keep getting turned down from places asking for Wi-Fi to call someone and I\u2019ve missed my check in time by several hours.\n\nFinally I find salvation in a cafe and I call my Italian relatives in the region. They help me figure out the correct bus and call the B&amp;B for me.\n\nSo now my arms, legs and back feel pulverized but i have made it to the B&amp;B and am happy. \n\nThank you to all the kind Italians who put up with my shit today \ud83d\ude02",

Huge help!",

So far it's \"slow\"/spotty in some parts, which is making me lean towards buying local sims. \n\nWould you happen to remember the reception quality in each country? Was watching YouTube/video calls smooth? \n\nWere you on at least 3g most of the time or higher or were you stuck on slower speeds?\n\nWas google maps working just as fast as your homebase?\n\nThanks!",

It\u2019s only available at 4G, and there might\u2019ve been a couple times it went to 3G. I think that was in Berlin, but speeds in Germany are sometimes bad. I dunno why. It\u2019s all networks though. \n\nAlso, Orange switches to the best connection (any network) in whichever country it\u2019s in. It uses local networks like in Germany it mostly used Telekom.. sometimes o2, in Portugal it was NOS.. In Spain just Orange and in Malta go.. and something else. \n\nI actually decided to buy a local Orange physical card when I was in Spain because I\u2019m spending a month there in June.. and I\u2019ll be going back enough in the future that I will keep it long term. Just gotta top it off once every six months. \n\nAs far as speeds, they were all good. The issue is limited data, in Spain with my new Orange sim I got a plan with 100gb. \u20ac20 for a month! And 20gb in the rest of Europe. \n\nHope this helped.\n\nEdit: Google maps worked perfectly everywhere, I know because I rely on it a lot. :)",

So the phones sold here under Verizon come with different antennas capable of using different bands. \n\nSometimes there are bands that the US and Europe uses like 1900, but it would still be better to get an international phone that primarily uses GSM to get better coverage and quality because of the band spectrum. \n\nI think T-mobile and AT&amp;T in the US is GSM, so their customers have more flexibility. They won't have to buy an international phone....they can just request an unlock to use a different SIM or pay up the nose for an international plan.",

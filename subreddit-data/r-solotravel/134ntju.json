    "postText": "I have been solo travelling across Vietnam and I have been having a lot of fun: staying at hostels, meeting new people and trying out new experiences.  I had a few weeks off before I start my new job and I decided to make use of it by solo travelling in Vietnam.\n\n Unfortunately I received an email today from the lady at my new job, that they have to push back the start date of my new job by a couple of months. I feel so heartbroken and today was rough in meeting new people. I considered cutting my holiday short(7 days left) and going back to potentially look for another job. But i don't want to waste this experience. Any tips on how I could enjoy my time here a bit more instead of worrying about the future? Thanks",

I'm honestly a bit jealous.\n\nLook at it this way: You have your whole career in front of you to work at the grind, make money, etc. These couple of months are a gift. Vietnam is luckily a very inexpensive destination, so if I were you, I'd look into changing your return flight and extending the trip as long as possible.",

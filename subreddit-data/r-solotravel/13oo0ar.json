    "postText": "Solo traveling through India, I've heard repeated references to \"The Hummus Trail\", a semi-mythical route that young Israelis take through the country after their military service ends.\n\nIt sounds cool, and I'd like to add some less-travelled stars to my Google Maps, but actually trying to Google the locations entailed by the route has proven frustrating.\n\nIs it a secret? Can someone tell me?",

It's just referring to popular tourist destinations where people visit, in a semi-derogatory overtourism lament sort of way. Because so many Israelis backpack in India, a lot of places started catering to them with signage in Hebrew, familiar food to Israeli travellers, partying, hanging out with other tourists versus experiencing the local culture, etc. Not so different from similar places in, say, Thailand, that cater to British or American travellers in English. You get the idea.",

No offense to Israelites (love you guys, you are great) but they rarely travel off the beaten path and normally travel in big groups and follow the trail of thousands of Israelis that travelled there before them. \n\nIf you really want something less travelled then go to Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan.\n\nIf you want to do something really cool you can even recreate the Silk Road. Way cooler than banana pancake trail, gringo trail or any other silly party trail named by backpackers.",

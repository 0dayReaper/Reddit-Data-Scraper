But you could also suggest me other not related mentions too!",

But I agree it doesn't have the same look and vibe as neon.\n\nIt's also possible that there are still untouched cities full of neon somewhere, you'd be looking for places that either heritage list entire entertainment districts or tourist towns that have declined massively in the last 15 20 years. \n\nBut then you are not likely to get the modern city vibe.",

Songshan and Xinyi are the main shopping districts.....hmmmm...probably LED also.\n\nMaybe Taitung in the SE part of the island, but I have never been to that city. They have the reputation of taking life slowly per my teacher.",

    "postText": "Hello all, I'm thinking of going to Albania in August.\n\nHas anyone in this sub been to Kor\u00e7e? And, specifically, the Beer Festival?\n\nI've seen the Kor\u00e7e Beer Festival and by the videos and pics on social media, it seems fun. But I would like your honest opinion, do you think it's alright to go as a solo traveler to Kor\u00e7e mainly because of the festival? I've looked on booking and I don't find any social hostels where I could meet other travelers. I believe the town has other interesting features, but the festival is what's on my mind and I don't think going there all alone would be that fun. Are there hostels or some kind of way of meeting other solo travelers you are aware of?   \n\nIf I pull the trigger to go, I would be only one night there, the closing night (20 august). Going there takes 2 days of my trip (Going from Skopje to Tirana and then to Kor\u00e7e). Those days could be spent going to Ohrid or spending another night in Skopje or going south to Albania.\n\nI don't mind being solo on hikes or visiting cities, that's mostly my plan for Albania, but nightlife seems more fun when you meet someone.\n\nThe festival seems fun, but I'm not sure if it's like \"summer festival with music fun\" or \"town festival to go with friends fun\".\n\nThe other plan would be, instead of Kor\u00e7e, spend some time around Gjirokaster, Berat or Sarande, what do you think of it?\n\nMuch, much thanks.",

            "comment": "I liked Kor\u00e7e, but it seems to get a range of reviews from travellers. I\u2019d describe it as a more lived-in-feeling city than Berat or Gjirokaster, but one that still has charm. There aren\u2019t a whole lot of \u201csights\u201d per se, and the renovated bazaar district was about 80% vacant when I was there in 2021, but it\u2019s also the origin point of a lot of things related to present-day Albanian culture and identity. \n\nI enjoyed just wandering its residential neighbourhoods northeast of the bazaar, which are probably the biggest and best example of a truly \u201cvernacular Albanian\u201d neighbourhood left in the country (as opposed to, say, Ottoman or Venetian or Communist-era).\n\nPut bluntly, no, there probably aren\u2019t going to be very many English-speaking western tourists looking to go on a beerfest pub crawl with you. And that route is a bit nuts for one night in Kor\u00e7e. What does the rest of your itinerary look like? A Skopje-Ohrid-Kor\u00e7e route might make more sense. \n\nAlso, while I enjoyed Kor\u00e7e, I think it would be strange to cut places like Ohrid or Gjirokaster in favour of it, unless you\u2019re really averse to places that have any amount of tourist crowds.",

                    "comment": "Thanks a lot for your answer!   \n\n I'm glad someone put it bluntly to me, when I saw that a nice festival could lie in my itinerary I started planning around it, and now I was starting to second guess if it was really worth it in favour of slowly taking one or two more nights somewhere else. I guess it isn't. I'm not really averse to places with tourists.\n\n&gt; And that route is a bit nuts for one night in Kor\u00e7e. What does the rest of your itinerary look like?   \n\nMy first idea would make Korce line up perfectly with the itinerary. It would be Skopje - Orhid - Korce - Gjirokaster - [someplace inbetween maybe, Sarande or Berat] - Tirana. But then travelling from from Ohrid to Korce seemed a bit tricky, so I thought Skopje - Tirana - [loop Korce, Gjirokaster, maybe someplace] - Tirana would be less risky. Making it to Korce would make me cut Ohrid, yes. I am/was trying to understand if going to a festival in Korce is something worth it (for me).   \n\nOnce again, thank you!",

Kor\u00e7e beer is pretty good for a mass produced local lager too.\n\nGjirokaster and Berat are pretty places, Sarande less so but it's at least by the beach, although Himare is probably the best seaside town.",

I really liked it. The mosque there in the centre of town had the best Adhan I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nI know what you mean about those bastard dogs too , they\u2019re bloody huge! I went out into the countryside in order to visit the Bektashi Teke and google maps sent me down muddy farm roads where those shithead dogs had a field day with me\u2026 I\u2019ve never thrown so many rocks in one day !\n\nI have zero regrets about going to Korce, the beer in Albania is sadly disappointing but the beer made in Korce of the same name is the best of the lot.",

I stayed in an AirBnB as I couldn\u2019t find any Hostels but I found out whilst I was there that the town can spelt multiple ways on websites and I was searching under the wrong one!\n\nKorce was a cute place. Like someone else said, not a huge amount of sightseeing. I was there for 2 nights and in all honesty halfway through day 1 I was sort of out of things to do. I am very big on nightlife myself, but I never came across anything and I tried to go into a couple of restaurants but they wouldn\u2019t seat me myself.\n\nHowever, I loved walking around the town and just taking it in, they called it the \u2018Little Paris\u2019 and in a way I could see why! The people were friendly and mainly surprised I was there. \n\nThe Town Square is beautiful and they have the first Albanian School there which I would recommend and the Bazaar is nice. In my experience there weren\u2019t any other travellers at all but that might have been as I was there at a weird time. \n\nI don\u2019t know anything about the Festival. However, Korce as a place itself is definitely worth a visit but you won\u2019t need anymore than a full day.",

    "postText": "Hi. I am 29M who is going to Peru in June. I want to stay there for minimum 4 weeks.  \nI already bought a ticket to Lima, Peru. It is one-way ticket, hopefully there is no problems to enter. (US Citizen).  \n2-3 days in Lima, Peru  --&gt; explore little bit city, get all essentials such as sim card, some food, medicine, pocket knife, hiking poles, etc.  \n2-3 days in Huacachina or Ica.   \n7 days in Huaraz, Peru. I want to hike there + mountains. Laguna 69 (Lake 69)    \n7-10 days in Cusco. With potentially hiking to Machu Picchu (Inka trail 3-4 days). It is very expensive, like hike for 4-5 days is minimum $ 650 :( is there any options to visit Machu Picchu cheaper?  \n3-5 days in Arequipa. Hike to Misti.\n\n  \nIquitos? -Amazonia? Manu National Park?  \n\n  \nWhat is the best way to transport from point A to B? Local bus or flying? \n\nIs there anything else interesting to visit?   \nMy budget aim for $40/day in Peru. \n\nI do not speak Spanish, so it is another 'challenge'. \n\nThank you",

            "comment": "You have plenty of time, so you should take the bus.\n\nFor Machu Picchu, the entry ticket is fixed. But you can hike an alternative trail independently (like the Salkantay) \n\nIf you don\u2019t already know about esims, do some research to see if your phone is compatible. It\u2019s way more convenient. \n\nI personally like Lima, but it\u2019s an unpopular opinion (and I only like it because I\u2019m into gastronomy) you can get food, medicine, pocket knives and hiking poles in pretty much all the places you mention. I would just rent the hiking poles, because they are a pain to travel with, especially if you do decide to fly.\n\nPeru is amazing. I\u2019ve been twice and I\u2019ll be going back at the end of June. I hope you have an amazing trip!",

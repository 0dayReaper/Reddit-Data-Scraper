    "postText": "Hello there! Planning to take a solo trip (and my first trip) to Europe, starting off from Berlin and ending off at Budapest, with the entire trip lasting 21 days. That's the only \"restriction\" that I have that is set in stone.\n\nI will be heading off for the trip in about 2 week's time. I'm still starting to get the skeleton of the trip out (which cities to visit, and how many days to spend on each city), and would love to get some thoughts or advice.\n\nIn general, when I first started planning this trip, the idea was to head to Berlin &gt; Prague &gt; Vienna &gt; Budapest. After some research, this is what I ended up with.\n\n* Day 1: Flight to Berlin\n* Day 2-5: 4 full days in Berlin\n* Day 6: Travel to Prague\n* Day 7-9: 3 full days in Prague\n* Day 10: Travel to Olomouc\n* Day 11: 1 full day in Olomouc\n* Day 12: Travel to Vienna\n* Day 13-15: 3 full days in Vienna\n* Day 16: Travel to Budapest\n* Day 17-20: 4 full days in Budapest\n* Day 21: Flight back to home country\n\nMy interests are: Visiting historical sites/concentration camps, museums, experiences where I can learn, nature. Not super into partying.\n\nBudget isn't really an issue here.\n\nMy questions are (feel free to only answer the questions you have an answer to):\n\n1. Any comments on the durations of my visit to any of these cities?\n2. Is Olomouc worth visiting? Or should I remove it from my itinerary and spend more time in Berlin/Prague/Vienna/Budapest\n3. Do you recommend other cities near Berlin/Prague/Vienna/Budapest that you'd recommend I visit instead?\n4. Amongst the cities I've listed, do you know which one of these cities might be good for trying out tandem skydiving for the first time?\n\nThank you!",

Not a whole lot to do, so depends what you want. \n3. Could you do Brno instead of Olomouc? It's Czech's second city, like a much quieter version of Prague. Has a castle, some museums, and an excellent bar called The Bar That Does Not Exist (good for a classy cocktail or mocktail and potentially chatting with locals). Definitely a bit more going on, and still good connections to Prague and Vienna.\n4. Absolutely no idea! But in terms of geography (hills) and pricing (cheaper) Prague would probably be my first point of investigation.",

I guess 3 full days in Budapest are enough, while from Vienna you could potentially have a day trip to Bratislava if you're interested. \n\n2. Never been there but it looks nice, also it's a less known place, I guess it'd be a nice place away from big cities.\n\n3. You could stop in Dresden on your way from Berlin to Prague, it's doable.\n\n4. Nope\n\nDuring your stay in Vienna you could consider a little hike in Nussdorf. Get the tram to Nussdorf and just follow the flow up to the hills. Full of wineries, nice wiev, enjoyable walk. It's not that interesting as it is in September when sturm is freshly produced and the atmosphere around the wineries is nice, still it's one of my favourite activities in Vienna. Also you could spend half day by the river. Get the metro to Alte Donau, walk to the eastern side of this old section of river Danube where you can swim. It's now more like a lake since this old section is only partially connected to the river, so there's no current. If you're interested in natural history you could visit the Naturhistorisches Museum. \n\nWhen in Berlin you can learn something in any museum, the DDR Museum, Topographie des Terrors, Wall Memorial etc.\n\nWhen in Budapest spend half day at Margaret Island, get some food at the Central Market then have a picnic at the island and relax, then go to the baths.",

I stayed about 1.5 days there and it was enough I think.\n\nBetween Berlin and Prague there is also Dresden as someone recommended already, check Zwinger on Google, it has the best collection of historical scientific instruments and chinaware I have ever seen, it blew my mind (too bad the inner garden is under construction). Tho I enjoyed Leipzig better.\n\nHope you will enjoy Budapest :)",

The t avle may be just a few hours but then you have packing to go, checking out, getting to the train station, then figuring out getting to your next hotel, checking in, getting settled, etc. Relocation generally takes about half a day and if you don't start first thing in the morning, by the time you arrive and settle you really just have time for a wander in your new place and finding a good meal vs touristing. I think it's smart to plan full travel days and be more relaxed. If things go very quickly then you have some bonus time but if not you're not stressing about missing plans.",

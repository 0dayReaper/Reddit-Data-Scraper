    "postText": "I've seen people post these sort of rants quite frequently and I never thought that would be me, and yet here I am. I'm at the tail end of a 9 week solo trip though Portugal and Spain. I have hit a wall in Madrid. \n\nThis isn't a question, as it's more just me just struggling to come to terms with where I'm at mentally. Madrid has been very difficult to enjoy as a solo traveler aside from the incredible museums and parks. The atmosphere here is all about being social in the vibrant tapas bar scene and nightlife. The language barrier here for non-Spanish speakers is difficult, and I've had multiple instances of being misunderstood and either receiving the wrong food, awkwardness, or being treated poorly or totally ignored. I'm in a hotel, so no social opportunities there. Guy in the next room has the smokers cough from hell. \n\nTo be honest, I'm struggling to muster the energy to do anything here. I've enjoyed the last two months of my trip immensely. I loved the 5 weeks I spent in Portugal. I loved the 10 days I spent in Andalusia.  \n\nNow I'm here in Madrid for the next four days before my return flight trying to dig deep to actually go out and do stuff. I don't know why this is such a struggle after the rest of my trip has been (for the most part) so fantastic. Travel burnout? Maybe. But I just feel very low right now, self-doubt and anxiety, which is discouraging me from even leaving my hotel. I'm not sure why this is creeping in at the very end.\n\nHas anyone else ever taken a trip for multiple weeks or months and just crash landed at the end?\n\nEdit: I am in no way blaming Madrid or the culture here. It's a beautiful city and I've enjoyed walking through the parks and visiting the art museums, and I've met some very kind people. I can acknowledge that my negative headspace combined with my more introverted nature is making it more challenging. Thanks for the helpful feedback and comments!",

It felt really difficult as a solo traveller, as mainly it's big groups of locals or tourists going out for tapas, bars, nightlife etc and I really struggled to find a group of friends compared to other Spanish cities I've been too. This is despite staying in a hostel. I'm sure Madrid is enjoyable for a lot of people, but it just wasn't for me. Also, factoring in travel burn out and its no wonder that you're struggling a bit, perfectly normal.",

So maybe it was a blessing in disguise.  \n\n\nAlso, during traveling keep in mind that what you're doing is being open to new experiences and not just being open to new GOOD experiences.

They were great, interesting people so it was a highlight and eased some of the feeling of being so alone. I figured, hey I am a tourist so I might as well embrace it and I\u2019m glad I did - it gave me some people to eat and drink with and some really fun experiences.\n\nI also moved from a so-so hotel to a nicer one and that made a huge difference - slept better, staff was nicer, could get laundry done, etc. \n\nI didn\u2019t worry about going out late, unless that\u2019s your thing. Honestly I couldn\u2019t keep up w Madrid. I ate dinner late and then I was done. No guilt about going to bed at midnight bc I want to be able to be out &amp; about the next day. \n\nOverall I liked Madrid but did experience some of passive-aggressiveness from a few people pretending not to understand my order, ignoring me or making less than favorable comments about tourists/Americans/our personal attributes that they thought we couldn\u2019t understand. My son joined me for the last few days I was there and while my Spanish is functionally basic, he is completely fluent so that surprised more than a few people. \n\nI hope you\u2019re recharged and can maybe just wander and enjoy looking at the sights of Madrid. One of my best afternoons was sitting in the window of Starbucks, eating a jamon sandwich, looking out at the city and the people and just reveling in it all. But it sounds like you\u2019ve had an amazing trip and yeah, I think it would be normal just to be tired, wherever your last stop happened to be.",

The whole coast was worth exploring and with only 10 days there I wasn't able to see or do as much as I wanted.

            "comment": "Not sure if that's going to help but there are a few absolutely stunning day-trips you can do from Madrid.. It'll take you away from the city that doesn't vibe with you (at least right now). It'll let you do relatively little as you'll be sitting in a train 2-4h (total) and at least I found the places absolutely impressive, leaving little room for other thoughts. (if you're into historic architecture).\n\nAlso consider rebooking/double-booking a night or two at a hostel so you can meet some people.. If that's not an option just hang out at the hostel bar, people are more open to talk, will likely speak English and prices are usually reasonable. The same can be done with guided tours.. It takes a little more strength as you're on a 1-2h timer... but if there's someone you managed to talk to during the tour, doesn't hurt to ask if they're up for a coffee afterwards or if they're interested in doing something together tomorrow. \n\nSome options for day trips are: Toledo, Segovia, El escorial, Aranjuez, Avila. For the day trips if you want some company, maybe look into an organized trip it'll be a bunch of people stuck in a bus.. If you think you'll be able to initiate contact that at the very least should give you some social contact as well.\n\nLast and not least: Sounds like you've been going 110% for the last 6 weeks.. maybe you just need to catch up on sleep and rest.",

I see people here doing two and three months vacation and even the occasional person doing a gap year vacation. I couldn't do that. I know after 4 weeks I want to go home and sleep in my own bed. Next time maybe split it up if you want to travel the full 9 weeks. Do 4 weeks and then do another 5 weeks later in the year. That way you will enjoy all of both trips. \n\nI do agree with all the posts that are saying take a day or two and do nothing.

I mean honestly how did you think the trip wasngoing to unfold?\nAfter 9 weeks you really should have picked up some\nspanish.\nYou could\ndo things like book a guided tour, visit all the churches and museums, spend a day at the shore.\nNightclubbing and eating alone are probanly not in the top-ten things\nto do alone.\nHope you enjoy the last days.",

There's only so much useful Spanish one is going to pick up in that brief amount of time. Is your position that one shouldn't travel for very long in countries where they don't speak the local language? The language barrier is obviously not my main issue, but it's amplified when I'm on the struggle bus mentally.",

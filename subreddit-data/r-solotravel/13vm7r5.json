    "postText": "Hey r/solotravel,\n\nCurrently 4.5 months into a year long around the world solo trip endeavor. To everyone else who has done it\u2026 man, what a ride. \n\nAs I look ahead to my future, I am curious to hear how long you waited before you were itching to get back out there again (ideally for another long trip). I\u2019m keen to work on my other interests/hobbies/career and nurture a community at home once my trip ends, but the journey won\u2019t end with this adventure.\n\nOne love!",

So if I do decide to go for a long trip there is this risk Ill get fired or be replaced and not have my job when I get back",

It is a pointless, mindless treadmill.  Stop wanting more and learn to recognize enough.\n\nAvoid debt, especially stupid consumer debt.  Most people buy that $75000 car or truck because that's what the neighbor has.  I drive a good looking 1987 Mercedes 190 2.5 Turbodiesel.  I found a really good one 5 years ago and paid $3200 for it.\n\nChoose and design the lifestyle that you want.  I think the perfect career would be ER physician.  You could take a traveler job for several months each year, and then travel until you decide that you want to work again.\n\nIt is a bit late for me to go to medical school, as it is for most people, but there are always possibilities, especially if you keep spending and debt in check.",

Just walking and the front of my sandal caught the stair. \n\nLast night I was walking in Monteverde Costa Rica and twisted my ankle on a rock sidewalk, falling and cutting my knee wide open on a big rock. 6 stitches. \n\nHave you faced anything like this while solo travelling? People are always so helpful. It really sucks though. I have never had stitches or broken a bone in my daily life at home.",

I guess if the police found me first the moto would have been impounded and I\u2019d be having to pay some bribe $$. The locals all used Guatemalan SIM cards there, so the man was able to call a \u2018taxi\u2019 to take me to the clinic over an hour away. \n\nThe hospital was very rural, rundown, hot, and busy but eventually they confirmed the obvious with an X-ray, a broken collarbone. I had to pester them about cleaning out my dirty scrapes that would 100% get infected, I guess that wasn\u2019t part of the treatment plan. Well there was no treatment plan actually, not even any pain pills, they just put me in a sling and that was that. Free of charge though! And I could buy pain pills at the pharmacy in town. \n\nI spent the night back in that village, I was dumped off in what you could call a boarding shack, completely alone. Tiny concrete room, rock hard bed, no cell service, no electricity, no real food stalls nearby, but I could buy snacks at a roadside store to eat. I didn\u2019t even know where my bike was! The adrenaline was wearing off and the pain was starting to really set in. Rough night. \n\nNext day the owner of the guesthouse got me back in touch with the guy who had my bike at his place. He said he couldn\u2019t get it to start. Right. I have to figure out how I\u2019m going to get it 8 hours back to San Cristobal de las Casas. At first we try standing on the side of the road to flag down trucks and buses on the hwy to help. Nada. \n\nWe go back to his home, I sit on a stool outside for a couple hours while he makes phone calls, the man is able to find two people with a decent truck who are willing to go (for a price obv), thank god. Hours later they show up, they load the bike in the back, get it all strapped in, I pay them lots of money, we make the awful awful 8 hour ride over the jillion speed bumps to SanCris and then I was much better able to sort out myself there! After some new (bad) X-rays I ended up getting collarbone surgery with the plate and screws in San Cristobal. Fun times! Surgery cost $1800 for anyone wondering.",

I made sure I didn\u2019t have food on me and kept my sunglasses/phone in my bag. I was sitting far away from a bunch of tourists feeding the monkeys when a monkey jumped on my lap. He, I swear, opened my hand and hissed/screeched when I didn\u2019t have anything for him. I jumped up. The monkey jumped on my shoulder. Another one latched onto my upper thigh. I batted the one on my shoulder off while the one on my thigh bit me. I just kept walking until the monkey jumped off. \nMoral of the story: don\u2019t trust any wild animal and get your rabies vaccines!! \ud83d\udc12",

The real kicker is that the doctor gave me over the counter penicillin and I started to get hives and an inflamed neck and ankles.  This was two days before my departure flight back home.  I stopped taking it and when I returned home, my ankles were still very inflamed to the point I could barely walk.  ER told me I was allergic to penicillin and had I taken anymore of it, it could've ended much much worse.  \n\nOn a different trip, the worse injury I had ever observed was on Koh Phangan.  There are no commercial airports on this island and is only accessible by ferry.  It's late afternoon at a beach hostel and it's very chill with all the guests just chilling; drinking and snacking on a patio deck watching the sun set.  Suddenly, to my left I hear a loud whack and the waitress runs over to a pretty husky guy laying face down with just blood pooling around his head.  He had a huge gash across the bridge of his nose from the fall on top of bamboo planks and was transported immediately by ambulance.  His newly-wed bride was frantic and they could only speak in broken english (they were French).  She ran to get their passports from the room.  2 minutes before this they were just having a friendly game of cards.  \n\nWe later learned that they were helicoptered out and the guy had fainted from severe dehydration.  To this day, it has changed my perspective in just how critical water intake is.",

Was awful realising it was a person and he was dead, could hardly believe it.   :(  Late 80\u2019s that was before the road down to HaadRin was put in - previous night late people coming down for the party, one overloaded boat had drunkenly crashed &amp; sunk.  Couple of dozen people had randomly separately made it to shore up &amp; down at different bungalows &amp; taken refuge, all without luggage that went down with the boat. Nobody even knew who or how many folk had been on it, this dude had washed up with the morning high tide.  We had to search his pockets &amp; waist bag for ID / passport, find a place to keep him till someone got a boat up to bring the cops back.  So sad, was just a youngster.   :(   But yeah, there\u2019s hecka worse stuff than that on Koh Phangan I\u2019m sure.  Awesome stuff too &amp; it\u2019s gorgeous or at least it was, I haven\u2019t been in nearly 20 yrs - but I hear stories.",

Bystanders were no help, didn't really care that I was laying there howling in pain. And at first, I thought I was going to die, the pain was so bad and the crunching sound when I hit was so terrifying. My sinus filled up with blood and there was gurgling when I took a breath. \n\nBut after a few minutes I was able to focus and get it together. I dragged myself up, walked the half mile back to where I was staying, and drove myself to the ER. Spent about five hours waiting before getting a CT scan and being discharged with a few pain pills and advised to see a specialist when I got home. Ruined the rest of my trip and my flight home a few days later was absolutely brutal (pressure changes in the cabin were hell on my fractured facial bones).  Couldn't eat anything but soup for about a month or two. Six months later, I'm finally almost fully healed. \n\nBut honestly, it wouldn't have gone much differently if I was home. I've had to drive myself to the ER at home before too. You just have to remember that nobody is coming to save you, so you gotta get up and help yourself.   Try to keep a cool head and stay calm.

I also reached out more to friends and family for support after both of those incidents and it really helped.  I cried alone in my room too about them and there was definitely some benefits to that! Looking back, I am quite proud of myself for navigating those difficult circumstances on my own in a foreign country. I think it made me stronger and more confident in myself and in my abilities. It also reminded me to make make sure someone knew where I was once in a while, just in case.\n\nSorry to hear about our injury. Wishing you a speedy recovery.",

            "comment": "I've had a few injuries on non-solo trips. Slipped on a hotel's pool deck, hit my head pretty hard and sprained my wrist. one of my travel companions took me to the hospital for a CAT scan and X-ray. And while wilderness backpacking, a buddy of mine twisted his ankle 5 days in either direction from our car. We splinted it, took as much weight as possible from his pack to distribute among the rest of us, and doped him up on pain killers for the rest of the week's hikes.\n\nAs far as solo trips go, no injuries for me. But I do have a food poisoning story. I once loaded a bunch of camping gear onto [my bicycle](https://np.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/goucwl/i_didnt_get_around_to_making_trek_thursday_happen/) and spent the better part of the next seven months riding 5,300 miles (8,500 km) around the western US. One night, I wasn't staying in a proper campground but rather just wild camping in the woods, when I started coming down with food poisoning. Spent the night tossing and turning and leaning out the door of my tent to vomit. First thing the next morning, the bike got a flat tire, and after fixing that, I rode through cold rain for half a day to a motel for some proper rest. Managed to out-run the food poisoning for a few days, but eventually it caught up to me, this time in the form of diarrhea (TMI, I know, but you asked!) Thankfully I was already in a city at the time, staying at a hostel for a few nights. Took a rest day and it worked itself out of my system.\n\nBefore I left on that big bike camping trip, a friend insisted on getting me first aid certified, and I've stayed up to date on that ever since. I carry a small first aid kit with me, and although it's been dead weight aside from bandaids, tweezers for pulling splinters, and other little things, it's dead weight I'm absolutely going to carry on all my travels. After the food poisoning incident, I added some Imodium to my toiletries bag, and ibuprofen while I was at it.",

Inconvenient body part to get stitches on, right on a bendy bit.  \n\nWell I got slash-bitten by a rabid puppy in India, had to ride my motorbike in 100\u00b0 heat a half hour away to a (good) hospital to start the rabies series as my previous rabies vaxx was like 8yrs old already.  The wound was very minimal though.  The puppy was found dead up the street the next morning with foam round its mouth poor thing.   Got chikungunya a few years before that just before I left India, ended up in hospital in Australia for a few days while they worked out what it even was lol - the nurses were convinced I was a cold turkey junkie they were really rude (it was a regional hosptial, country bumpkins) - me with fever of 105\u00b0 getting a bit worried them telling me \u2019stop calling us, there are authentically sick people here we have to take care of\u2019, they weren\u2019t even checking on me or filling in my chart - I had to track the fevers myself.  Finally tests came back as chikungunya so I checked myself out against medical advice when the fevers started receding a little, mates came &amp; picked me up &amp; took care of me for another week haha.  Thanked gods I wasn\u2019t still in India for that, great timing!\n\n Have been with friends or other travellers when they\u2019ve had really bad accidents or illnesses though, limbs nearly coming off, malaria or typhoid n stuff like that.  Pretty fucked up - roadside emergency wound management or getting their guest house door busted open cos they\u2019ve locked it from the inside then got sick &amp; delirious, battling to find &amp; get them transported to *a good hospital*, accessing their money to pay hospitals &amp; treatments, calling family n insurance companies (the ones who even had travel insurance) n all the rest.  Some random other solo traveller druggie lost-its or folk who\u2019ve gone off their meds &amp; gone psychotic or schitzo, pretty sad, &amp; difficult - finding where they stay, getting their check-in info or going through their luggage to find passport &amp;/ family contacts or calling their embassies.  Yeah SEAsia &amp; India can be pretty wild, specially back a few decades ago before internet &amp; mobile phones n all.  Most adventures don\u2019t go wrong but when they do it\u2019s pretty crap - most had happy results in the end though so yeah.

You can buy this service trip by trip, but my kids are in college far from home and we travel a lot so we have a membership for our family of four, year round. The cost is only $380 USD total per year. Heck, I spend that on a big trip to Costco! \n\nThere is also a higher level of service where they will send a team to extract you out of a war zone or pluck you off the side of Mount Everest, but I don\u2019t typically travel where there isn\u2019t some form of medical care.\n\nHere is the link:\n[Redpoint Travel Protection - Cavalry Plan](https://redpointtravelprotection.com/plan/cavalry/)",

Thankfully we had a doctor on board who was sitting right behind me and popped it in straight away. Wasn't actually too painful. Bought a sling the next day and took it easy, but luckily wasn't too bad or cause issues.\n\nI did sprain my wrist in Indonesia though. Was off on a trip with some local guides who had just run the group tour I was on. We went off to a fairly remote island to camp, and went Snorkeling on the way. The boat had a tiny/short ladder that was hard to climb and I really struggled getting back into the boat. And doing so I heard a pop in my wrist as I got in. Assumed it was a sprain, and had to camp in a tent on a hard uncomfortable floor, followed by a day of driving a scooter on my own which was painful. Eventually cut the trip short as  I couldn't ride a scooter or swim like that.\n\nAnd finally the not an injury, but a scramble to get out of Thailand in December 2021 during covid. I must have caught a cold on the plane to Thailand, was slowly getting sicker and a cough. It was almost Christmas, when quarantines were almost going to be reintroduced. I didn't want to risk getting sicker and having a cough or fever going through the airports, so booked a flight home for the next day, rushed to get a completely rip off priced PCR test (thankfully negative - but had. A bunch of tests with me checking daily anyway) which just arrived in time. And made it home probably a few days before quarantines came back.",

    "postText": "Howdy reddit (25m, Australian), I'm planning a trip up to Norway for about 6 weeks in duration in July / August. With a month to be a planned farmstay in Nordland. On each side of that I've got about 4-5 days each to travel, sight see, do things. I'm pretty adventurous, the main driver to go was to experience the remote beauty of Norway, unfortunately I've been blow away by the expensive nature of the country.\n\nWondering for those who love hiking, the outdoors etc. How you backpacked through Norway and what activities your prioritised or were able to hack out with relatively easy (I stress relative) public transport commutes to access some of the more remote areas, without renting a car? Some of the areas that have caught my eye are: Odda, Lofoten, Jontheim, Geiranger. But all have their pros / cons. Pretty keen to hear other experiences.\n\nI'm committed to Tromso for the midnight sun. Are their other ways to access the Tromso area / region without renting a car? (also if anyones in Tromso in July and would like to do some exploring, hiking and would like to split a car I'd be up for that :))\n\nThanks so much!",

            "comment": "Most people have a slightly outdated perception of how expensive Norway is; I find that people overestimate costs of living in Norway. This year is probably the best time to visit Norway in a long time, it\u2019s actually become much cheaper to visit Norway. The currency exchange rate is now very favourable to Dollars and Euros, and I\u2019d assume also the Australian Dollar, the Norwegian crones have been getting weaker since about 10 years and especially lost value in the last 2 years. Norway also has had a significantly lower inflation rate than most other countries in Europe; prices for goods and services didn\u2019t rise nearly as much as in other places. If you\u2019re used to prices in say Melbourne or other metropolitan Western cities you won\u2019t find Norway that much more expensive (excluding alcohol ofc.) I really wouldn\u2019t worry so much about costs in Norway. \n\nWhereabouts in Nordland is your farmstay? It\u2019s a pretty beautiful yet an underrated part of Norway! If you can I\u2019d prioritise visiting Northern Norway, there\u2019re so many beautiful places to see. Along Nordlands Helgelandskysten there\u2019re some really nice islands that are worth visiting (e.g. Lovund, Her\u00f8y, or the iconic Norwegian mountain Torghattan) otherwise go further North to visit the Lofoten Archipelago (V\u00e6r\u00f8y is a bit of a hidden gem). Senja too is an absolutely incredible place to visit and Troms\u00f8 and Lyngen are likewise absolutely stunning; endless possibilities really! \n\nYou should join Getaround, which is an app/website where people rent out their private cars, it\u2019s usually cheaper than the regular rental companies. Many places are much easier to visit if you have access to a car, but if you want to look up public transport schedules in Norway use [Entur](https://entur.no). In Troms\u00f8 you can\nalso rent e-bikes, in case car rental prices are too expensive for you. If you want to get some inspiration for hikes check out [https://ut.no](https://ut.no) , it\u2019s the most commonly used outdoor app in Norway.\n\nEdit: Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out for further / more specific recommendations!",

In Lofoten you can bike the whole length so you get to see everything you want in your own pace. I know there are some companies that rent bikes etc there, or else you could buy a used one. The used site in Norway is finn.no.\n[Shitty tent from biltema](https://www.biltema.no/en-no/leisure/camping-and-outdoors/tents/cupola-tent-roskilde-2000032749 )\n[shitty sleeping bag biltema ](https://www.biltema.no/en-no/leisure/camping-and-outdoors/sleeping-bags/sleeping-bag-8-c-2000034916 )\nThey also have bikes and camping equipment, their website can be set to English so easy to find what you need.\nMaybe if you're lucky you find some tourist that arrive when you leave so you can sell your gear to them. Or just try to sell it at Finn.no",

            "comment": "Depends. Are you bringing a tent with you or not?  Which airport is you point of entry/exit and how are you getting to/from Nordland from there?\n\n4-5 days isn't a lot of time considering the distances and time needed to travel around. Your choices will probably be limited to the area enroute between the airport of entry and the farmstead.\n\nThe good news is that there are awesome mountains and experiences almost all over the place.\n\nAs an Aussie, you'd probably enjoy Jotunheimen. It's bus-friendly, has lots of pointy peaks, as well as glaciers and snow fields.",

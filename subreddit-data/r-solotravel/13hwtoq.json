Kampen district and Gamle Byen district is a bit off the beaten path, more quiet, nice and colorful architecture. \n\nYou'll cover a lot of places in your list though. Just around the central station, Opera House and Akerbrygge is very touristy, but nice nonetheless. Grunerl\u00f8kka is the hipster place in the city, lots of cool places, good food and drinks.",

                    "comment": "I booked my Oslo to Bergen train around mid-February and I was in Norway 15-19 May. Prices do go up as the time nears, so bear that in mind. Book directly via Vy for best prices ([https://www.vy.no/en/buy-tickets/train-and-bus-tickets](https://www.vy.no/en/buy-tickets/train-and-bus-tickets)) as any other place will rip you off. I travelled Standard although there is a more expensive ''Plus'' option as well, which apparently has ''better seats'' among other things. In my experience Standard class was perfect (comfortable seats, food tray and sockets for charging at each seat) and there was nothing extra I needed. I saw no reason to pay extra for Plus class.\n\nI spent roughly 2 days in Bergen (arriving around 7pm on a Wednesday and leaving around 4pm on a Friday). As far as Bergen is concerned, I planned nothing in advance and just decided what I was going to do on a day to day basis. July is probably peak tourist season however, so you might want to book certain things in advance (the fjords cruise for example). See details below.\n\nHere's what I did/visited (and enjoyed thoroughly):\n\n1. Bergenhus Fortress (free entry to roam around the fortress, paid entry to the museum parts of it). Make sure to look at the map and visit the far end of the fortress for a nice view across the city. There are also a small funfair and a mini-zoo close to it, if you are a fan of those. I visited neither as I didn't have the time, but they seemed interesting.\n2. Fjords cruise - There's plenty to choose from but I did the 3.5 hour one from Bergen to Mostraumen. I booked with these guys ([https://rodne.no/en/fjordcruise/fjord-cruise-to-mostraumen/](https://rodne.no/en/fjordcruise/fjord-cruise-to-mostraumen/)) and I was pretty happy with the size of the boat and the trip itself. Prices are the same irrespective of how early you book (I think), but they may not have any spaces left if you wait until last minute when it comes to July. In my case I just booked the evening before.\n3. Fl\u00f8ibanen funicular to Fl\u00f8yen - great views across the city if you get up there on a sunny day. Make sure to look around for the Troll Forest (Trollskogen) and the freeroaming goats which are very friendly!\n4. Bergen fishmarket - a variety of fresh fish to choose from and have it cooked for you right there and then. I would also recommend checking the other vendors close to the market for the following items:\n\n4.1 Norwegian doughnuts (Smultringer) - the food shack selling them is simply called Donut House and is located right next to the fish market although details are scarce online or on any maps.\n\n4.2 Cloudberry jam and jelly - a particularly difficult treat to find apparently, but there is a vendor that sells these right beside the fishmarket.\n\n5. Roam around town to explore the graffiti culture. Here's a guide: [https://streetartcities.com/cities/bergen](https://streetartcities.com/cities/bergen)\n\n6. visit Lille Lungeg\u00e5rdsvannet - a small lake in the centre of Bergen\n\n7. Fantoft Stave Church - Free to see outside, paid entry inside. Nice to look at outside, unimpressive inside (I thought).\n\n8. Hanseatic houses in Bryggen  \n\n\n9. Trekroneren hot dog stand - plenty of options - all delicious!\n\nOther than that free roaming around town is also definitely bound to take you someplace nice.",

July seems like an excellent time to experience it. \n\nA lot pricier too, however.",

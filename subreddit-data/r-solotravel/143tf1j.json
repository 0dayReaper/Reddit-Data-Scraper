    "postText": "Hello, fellow solo travelers!  \n\n\nHaving recently returned from a year of solo travel and staying in party hostels around the world, I must say that nothing quite compares to the incredible social atmosphere and sense of adventure I experienced during that time. The people I met were always open to interaction, single, young, and attractive, creating a dynamic and exciting environment.  \n\n\nNow that I'm back in my hometown, I find it challenging to replicate that same atmosphere and level of interaction when going out to bars and clubs. It seems like everyone is more closed off and less eager to mingle compared to the solo-travel community.  \n\n\nHowever, I'd love to be proven wrong about this! I want to believe that it's possible to find similar vibes and connections right here at home. That's why I'm turning to the experienced and knowledgeable solotravel community for your thoughts and insights.  \n\n\nHow do you recreate the lively and sociable atmosphere of a solo-travel party hostel in your hometown? Have you found ways to meet like-minded individuals who are open to new friendships and adventures? What are your strategies for finding the best party spots and social scenes in your own city?  \n\n\nI'm eager to learn from your experiences and gather some valuable tips. Whether it's recommendations for specific venues, events, or even alternative ways to connect with outgoing and adventurous people, please share your wisdom!  \n\n\nWhile I genuinely believe that the solo-travel party hostel lifestyle is unique, I'm hopeful that there are ways to find similar atmospheres and forge meaningful connections closer to home. Let's help each other discover the hidden gems and exciting social scenes that might be right under our noses.  \n\n\nThank you in advance for your input and suggestions. I can't wait to read your responses and learn from your collective wisdom!",

Everyone who goes is open to making new friends and, for the sports, usually young and into keeping fit.\n\nIf you really want the same vibe, you can try getting a part time job at a hostel near you.",

            "comment": "I think the difference could be that when you're travelling you don't have to worry about \"life stuff\"  and everyone is out to accomplish the same goal. It's a bit of a bubble as you are there to have fun and experience new things. \nHowever, if you just spent all day working dealing with people and stressing out how you're going to pay your bills, you are less likely to want to leave your comfort zone. You probably just want to go home and do something familiar or at the most hang out with people you already know. \n\nIt takes some courage to break this mentality which is why you usually meet sociable people when you travel. These people have taken the leap.",

Once the connection with other people is established let the barkeeper go . \n\nBe very attentive to the people's body language and let them be if they're not looking for a connection.",

I went with a friend that was staying at the hostel and it was the first time out of over 100 hostel bars that there were more locals than travelers. It was like a local dive bar. Not saying it was a bad experience but I feel like that is the closest it will get for me here. But yeah as others suggested meetup app is great as well as other Facebook groups.",

I used it (not to stay with people, just to meet people) and in one destination, there was a whole community of local people who used CouchSurfing as a sort of informal club. I had reached out to one person in particular, and then she asked if I'd be up for meeting other folks - when I showed up at our meeting spot, there were six people plus me. Three of them lived in the destination,  and the other four of us were just in town for a short period, all of us having contacted various hosts in the destination.\n\nPoint being, I don't know how coordinated it was among the people who lived in the destination. But it was coordinated enough that they had a CouchSurfing flag, and in following some of them on social media, this type of meetup isn't unusual at all. You could be in the instigator!",

    "postText": "Hello! Long-time lurker, first time poster! I (36F) am planning my first solo trip this summer (Houston to Porto, Portugal, coming back to Houston from Madrid). I checked from all major hubs in the area and the only affordable flights back leave at either 5am or 6am - so I settled on Madrid departure at 6 am. Sucks - but it is what it is for my budget. \nMy question is about my best bet to get safely to the airport by 3/3:30 am? Should I stay at a hotel near the airport with shuttle or will it be just as easy to get a shuttle or taxi service from a hotel more central? Is it safe to do that kind of thing by myself so late at night/early morning?\nSorry if this sounds dumb - I\u2019ve never travelled alone and I\u2019ve never been to Spain before so I just don\u2019t know what to expect whatsoever. Thanks in advance to anyone who has some input!",

            "comment": "It depends where you are staying in Madrid. If you are near city center, there are buses you can take that will take you straight to the airport. Other option is to prebook a taxi. Taxis are a fixed price from inside the M30 to the airport. Show up at scheduled time and are reliable. I believe it\u2019s a fixed rate of 30\u20ac. Safe travels!",

You pay a bit more of a price for those hotels but they really can be worthwhile for painfully early flights, since you can set an alarm and basically just roll out of bed and walk to the check-in area of the airport. Maybe worth looking in to whether there's an option like that in this airport just for the convenience and extra bit of sleep it would allow you to get.",

The airport express is much cheaper (5 vs like 30), but unless your hotel is near where the bus takes off I would just take a taxi because it's a bit annoying to get there in the middle of the night via night busses. You don't really need to worry about safety. Madrid is a very safe city, even at night.",

It was the second time that I was travelling alone in my life and I felt v safe at the airport there even at night:)) there were still tons of people and the good thing about night flights is imo you will never have to queue for security so I went through it in 5 mins. I arrived v early cause I\u2019m very paranoid on missing flights I just got some food and chilled in a seat till it was time. Nothing sketchy anywhere.\n\nWe were out with my friends one night and I walked home from Malasa\u00f1a (area where\u2019s lots of bars n stuff) alone for like 15-20 mins and I felt v safe:) must\u2019ve been around 3am. Just act confident and u know the usual stuff if u see weird people change the side of the street ur walking on but really.. ive been to Madrid two times now it always felt v safe to me especially bc its a relatively small city (at least compared to Berlin where I live now) and it\u2019s very walkable!\nDon\u2019t worry too much I hope u enjoy ur stay!",

            "comment": "Darling, Madrid airport is supersuperbig. This airport even has several trains to go to different terminals. I don\u2019t know about Houston so I can\u2019t compare it for you but I\u2019d say even for domestic flights, you need to be there 2.5 hours in advance at least as a minimum. For you, 3 to 4 hours I\u2019d say. Besides that, summer is the busiest time in Spain, June and July in particular. That means long lines of course. I was there last week, came in 2 hours in advance (I took my chance and took the very first metro there) but I already checked in and had only handluggage. The line at the security weren\u2019t long at all, so in the end, I had some time to spare, but even then, not too much I think.\n\nThe metro\u2019s go there, line 8, starting from Nuevos Ministerios. I think they stop around 1.30 am. There are buses 24 hours, during daytime from Atocha station and in the nighttime from Cibeles. It\u2019s both in the center. The buses are 5 euro\u2019s. Check were you need to go, T123 or T4. Taxis are always an option of course. You\u2019ll be fine! Just check where you are staying. If you can walk to Cibeles during the night you can take the bus. If you have to take a taxi to the busstations, you might as well let them take you to the airport straight away.",

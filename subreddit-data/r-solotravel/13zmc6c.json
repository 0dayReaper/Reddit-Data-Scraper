    "postText": "Hi all, I am posting this as a trip report more than anything else so enjoy the read :)\n\nI have recently returned from a 9 days long trip to the Balkans. I let my excitement calm down over the past week or so and I am now ready to share my experience! I will be discussing the budget at the end!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWHERE?\n\nI visited 3 countries: Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia\n\nWHEN?\n\n8th until the 17th of May\n\nITINERARY\n\n8th-11th in Pristina, Prizren and Peje in Kosovo\n\n12-15th in Budva, Montenegro\n\n16th-17th in Belgrade, Serbia\n\nThe plan was that there was no plan. I knew what is where and what cool things I can do but unfortunately I didn't enjoy good weather as it was raining for 7 out of 9 days. In Kosovo I travelled with two friends from Korea which I will mention later. We had a rental car from Pristina Airport which allowed us to go around the country easily and allowed us to avoid places with worse weather.\n\nAs I was not travelling alone for parts of the trip, I was flexible with activities which unfortunately were very limited due to the aforementioned weather conditions. Whenever we could we were out and about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHE EXPERIENCE\n\nThe highlight of the trip for me was definitely Kosovo. Amazing place so different to any country I visited before! Beautiful villages, cities, nature and all of that within reach as the country is small. It makes for a good short trip especially if you have a car, which is very easy to get! Prizren was our favourite city. Good hikes, beautiful views and good food! We also stumbled upon a locally owned liquor store where we bought our first bottle of Rakia, lovely owner!\n\nOn the last day we returned our car in the morning and took a bus from the airport to the city centre from where we took a bus all the way to Budva, Montenegro passing through beautiful Albanian mountains on the way south.\n\nI had high expectations for Budva and Montenegro in general. I knew the weather was not going to be great but I tried to make the most out of it. The bus from Kosovo arrived around 1am so I already knew my next day is going to be slow. On the first day I appreciated the beautiful surroundings. That is also the day when my experience started to go south. I got scammed out of 40euros by a taxi driver for a 15 minute ride, why does it always happen in beach destinations? I spent the day swimming in Sveti Stefan, drowning the sorrows of loosing 40 euros. The water wasn't warm but it was the only day of sunshine I had so I had to enjoy it, it was my first time at the Adriatic Sea after all!\n\nI quickly realised that 3 days in Budva are too many especially considering the weather. After my nice swimming/sunbathing day I found myself mostly just strolling around the Old Town(which did surprise me in a good way!). I decided that going to Kotor or anywhere else in the area doesn't make much sense and I will leave it for another trip later this summer. I spent my evenings at the beach next to Old Town, drinking and listening to waves crashing against the walls until late hours of the night every night. That was probably the nicest thing about my stay in Budva, as for a person that doesn't do partying on trips like this, it was a pretty boring and empty tourist town.\n\nLast day in Budva was the bus-catching day. I read a lot about bus services in the Balkans so I was prepared to just let things happen the way they should. And so my ticket was for a 12:30 bus from Budva to Bar. The bus didn't arrive until \\~13:00 and I was told by the driver this is not the correct bus despite it being clearly stated on the ticket that it was. Happens, I thought. I asked the ''bus station person'' what to do and they just put me on the next but to Bar at around 13:30, which was completely fine by me.\n\nWhy would you go from a tourist town of Budva to a tourist town of Bar some may ask? Well, for the past two years I dreamed about experiencing the Belgrade-Bar railway journey, rumoured to be one of the Great Train Journeys. And so I was finally there, in a random restaurant/bar/cafe next to a very Soviet-looking Bar Train Station. I bought my ticket for a couchette in a 6-bed compartment for \\~24 euros one-way all the way to Beograd Centar. It was 16:00 and my train, Lovcen, didn't leave until 19:00. I spent that time looking for an ATM, eating at a Burger King with a parking lot the size of a country and chilling next to the station, great atmosphere in that area! Very quiet and for someone who hasn't travelled to the east it was very surreal to see palm trees, soviet architecture and Cyrillic all around next to each other. I felt like it was a good time to say bye to Montenegro for now.\n\nThe ride was incredible. Yes, if you, like me, can't sleep anywhere outside of your own bed properly you're most likely not going to sleep on this train either. But the sleepless night was worth every minute of the breathtaking scenery of the Montenegrin Mountains as we climbed higher and higher. Having come in May, I only had about \\~2 hours of daylight to look out the window and I made sure to not loose a single second of it. If you ever thought about taking the trip, I couldn't recommend it enough. Yes it's not the fastest, most comfortable way to get to Belgrade, but it was an experience I will not forget!\n\nTakeaways from Montenegro:\n\n* do not use ATM's other than the ones from a bank which name I don't remember but it started with an e. All other ATMs charge 5eur for every transaction no matter how much money you want to withdraw. That is another way that I lost \\~40 euros.\n* Restaurants add service charge not on the bill but by word of mouth which confused me many times but I complied since I didn't know the rules. If that is indeed customary then I would avoid pricier restaurants as the charge waiters were quoting was about 20% of the bill, way too much and a cold shower after Kosovo where I ate a 2-course meal with 2 of my friends for 14euros TOTAL.\n* People gotta chill out, no need to get mad at a bus being late, its just the way it is, plan for that in advance and you will be perfectly fine\n* More tourists than I expected, especially for May, the rainiest month\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext stop was the great city of Beograd. After my \\~13hour train journey I arrived at Beograd Centar Station (confusing af!) at around 7:00am. My check-in time was 13:00 so I had a lot of time to kill even though I was already dead. I tried looking for a way to get to city centre because don't be mistaken, Belgrade Central Station is NOT in the centre. During my walk I found an exchange office which didn't scam me so I was off to a good start. With my 6000 dinars I strolled the city looking for food.\n\nLater I saw the pedestrian, ''tourist'' area, the Castle, the riverside and some random streets and local markets. Overall, though I may be biased because of lack of sleep, Belgrade felt a little bit boring. Yes, I saw many people out and about but it felt too quiet. Serbia on the other hand, I will have to visit again as the people and the culture intrigue me!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBUDGET\n\nI got tickets from London Luton to Pristina, Kosovo for around \u00a340 and back from Belgrade Airport to London Luton for \u00a345. I didn't hold back on anything really. I was booking AirBnb's on the day of arrival usually especially in Kosovo.\n\nFlights: \u00a395\n\nCar rental in Kosovo \u00a3135(fuel included, cost divided by 3 since I was with friends = \u00a345)\n\nAirBnb \\~\u00a390 in Kosovo\n\nBudva accommodation \\~\u00a350\n\nBelgrade accommodation \\~\u00a335\n\nTrain ticket from Bar to Belgrade in a sleeping car - \u00a320\n\nScam ATM's - \u00a340\n\nFood is a tricky one since I didn't exactly track my expenses but I had a lot of seafood and kebabs on the trip. I would say \\~\u00a3300 for the 9 days. Keep in minds I never cooked a single meal it's all for eating out.\n\nAll in all I spent about \\~\u00a3600 for the 9 days of exploring which works out to between \u00a365-70 per day. Not bad but I know next time what to do to lower the cost. I am fully aware this trip could have ended up \u00a3200 or more cheaper but I am satisfied with what I got.\n\nThoughts? Tips on next time in the area? I definitely need to go back, especially to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. Hope you had an interesting read!",

Prizren is great and even though Prishtina is not everyones cup of tea, I feel like it has an interesting vibe to it!\nI highly recommend doing Albania next time! Especially the northern part of Albania which is underrated compared to the southern part. Theth and Valbona are a must and the city of Shkod\u00ebr!\nHit me up next time you find yourself in Prishtina. Drinks are on me!",

Immediately thereafter, my card was taken at an ATM. I waited at the bank until opening, but the only help I got was a roll of duct tape to wrap my swollen ankle in my newly sole less shoe. I think I was on a budget of about 10 bucks a day until I met up with friends in Munich the next week. Pretty girls, though.",

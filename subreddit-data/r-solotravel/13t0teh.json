    "postText": "Hi everyone. I was thinking about this a lot, reading the stories here. May I ask you about your life beside solo traveling? If some can afford a month or more just solo traveling, does it come with a solo life? And here I'm mainly interested in opinions from people ofer their 30s or 40s. Does living a digital nomad life and travel a lot let you to build up a working relationship? Or does the addiction to travel gives the boost to live a happy solo life along? What is your story behind solo traveling?",

            "comment": "I think everyone who travels solo has their own reasons for it. Mine is that with the exception of a few 2+ years long relationships I\u2019ve been single since grad school. I refuse to let life pass me by and travel makes me happy. That being said, there have been a few years where the thought of traveling alone depressed me, so I just didn\u2019t go. Ideally I want to find love and have a partner who loves to travel as well. I don\u2019t find the idea of constant travel too appealing while I\u2019m working - one 2 week trip each summer is enough until I retire :)",

I prefer to do about 3 international trips a year that are 6-12 days in length - longer term travel is not appealing to me. These trips are now a mix of solo and with my husband (while I\u2019ve met up with friends for part of trips abroad, I have never traveled a full trip with anyone other than my husband and have no desire to travel with friends).\n\nInitial reason for solo - I didn\u2019t want to plan trips around other people\u2019s schedules. I was a teacher and if I didn\u2019t travel based on my own availability alone, I probably wouldn\u2019t get to go anywhere.\n\nNow reason for solo - I love the time to self reflect and be my own company. I\u2019m an only child and enjoy spending time with myself, and I like the challenge of not being able to rely on anyone else to socialize, get me out of a pickle, etc. Also, I tend to \u201ctour guide\u201d travel partners and get very preoccupied with making sure they are having a great time, which negatively impacts my ability to have a good time and be present. I do like traveling with my husband but it\u2019s a different experience and his \u201ctravel stamina\u201d isn\u2019t as high as mine.",

The offer was always open for them to join me, but they didn't want to.  My partner during the year-long trip did join me for part of the trip, but he wasn't interested in doing the entire thing.\n\nI'm quite content with the solo life.  My last relationship ended 12 years ago, and I've been on maybe 5 or 6 dates since then.  I don't miss being partnered in the slightest.\n\nIf I were to choose to be in a relationship again, I would still continue to travel solo.  I would travel with them as well, but I need a lot of time alone to stay mentally healthy.  There's nothing wrong with doing your own thing.  Being in a committed relationship doesn't mean you need to always do everything together all of the time.",

I worked my ass off to be able to live and travel alone, because that's how I prefer things.\n\nI don't typically do months overseas.  I have a dog, so we can do longer trips domestically where I can drive us, but that doesn't work for going months via plane.  I do short domestic trips throughout the year, plus 2-3 bigger trips (usually 1-2 weeks each) a year.\n\nTo be honest, I have no desire to be on the road for months at a time.  I like having a home base to come back to.  A place that is mine.  And travel isn't my *only* hobby, I have plenty of other projects to occupy me at home.\n\nI travel solo because it's a natural extension of how I live my life.  There are places I want to see and things I want to do.  And I have health issues that I know will preclude this kind of travel when I'm older, so I have to do it NOW.

Story?  I like travelling so I travel.  I don't wait to have someone else along.  I continue living my life.\n\nI have never worked while travelling.  That would just be working elsewhere, not travelling.",

I would say what I'm doing is very much traveling, and my experience of Taiwan is deeper and more meaningful than any tourist's will ever be.",

I try for one long solo trip per year (3 weeks or so), and one long trip with my wife. Plus in-country road trips (which I don't count LOL!). \n\nWe don't always want to do the same things, and I'm more adventurous and have more ability, and I'm lucky enough that she gets that. \n\nBoth have their plusses and minuses. It's good to share an experience on a couples trip; but it's also good to do what you want when you want. There are simply things I wouldn't get to do on a couples trip. And since I do the planning for all the trips, when things go wrong on a solo trip rather than a couples trip, I don't feel so bad about it. Chalk it up to adventure rather than worry about subjecting someone else to a miserable time.",

If you don't want to do it, you can just stop and focus on other areas of your life. You meet a lot of people so you don't feel very lonely doing it. It's easy to keep going because you're always thinking of the next trip, the next dry season or the next festival.\n\n\nI achieved my schedule with shift work. I worked 14 days (12 hours/day) and then I would have 14 days off. I don't get a lot of long trips but I get to travel often.",

I don\u2019t have any major responsibilities back home besides work and my boss is usually extremely flexible with me taking 1-2 week long vacations as long as I give like 1-2 months notice in advance. At my age, most folks are starting to have more responsibilities such as significant others and kids. I enjoy traveling with other friends but often times it is difficult to align my plans and travel interests with others. I typically do one domestic trip in the USA and one international trip each calendar year. \n\nSo it can really vary with me, depending on who is available and what the nature of the trip is. I visited three countries in the middle east with three friends last fall, and I spent the entire time with them, but luckily their travel interests aligned with mine. Last month I went to Japan with a friend for 2 weeks and I spent about half the trip by myself since we had different priorities on that trip, but we would usually meet up for dinner or some sort of meal on most days. I also enjoy traveling to national parks in the USA more than my friends do, so I will typically go on those trips solo.",

            "comment": "36M. I started solo traveling when I was with my ex, because travel is one of the areas (one of many!) where we grew apart as a couple. I started taking bigger and bigger adventures, while she confessed she didn\u2019t like traveling in developing countries (imo I thought it was a tad racist). After we split, I spent 3 months eat, pray, loving across India solo. \n\n5 years later and I\u2019m married to a lovely woman who loves travel as much as me (atm were in morocco), but she\u2019s an attorney, and a public defender at that. She gets about 2 weeks off a year, whereas I get 5 weeks off a year.\n\nLast fall I spent a month traveling across Central Europe. I\u2019m actually a photojournalist on the side and shoot sports, so I spent a month taking trains thru Italy, Switzerland, Germany and Czech Republic, shooting hockey games. This year, I have a ton of miles on Southwest, so I might go somewhere they fly solo (possibly Costa Rica).\n\nSelling all my shit and live laugh loving across SE Asia or South America does sound like a blast but I don\u2019t think digital nomading is for me. I have a nice rent controlled apartment in Culver City, two dogs and a wife who I love to death. I like my routines, and like breaking my routines to go on a big adventure equally as much. If my entire life was a big adventure, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d enjoy it the same.",

I'd done some \"solo journeying\" really early in our relationship as part of my PhD and then to \"meet people on the internet\"; later we both got jobs that required a certain amount of travel and it always seemed sensible to turn those into solo trips if work were paying for the flights, etc.  None of these have been super long, I think the longest I was away was a little over 3 months, and then we did a month travelling together after that.\n\nI guess it's lucky that we both a) like travel b) like the same sort of travel c) appreciate other people's need to travel d) don't have an issue with the other going off on a jolly without us.

It\u2019s been fun but I think I want to start acting more my age while starting a career thats well paying &amp; provides a good work/life balance.\n\nHopefully this would allow me to travel for work &amp; choose cities depending on the season, with seasonal remaining an option (especially if they start treating their employees better) &amp; still have plenty of time &amp; money to travel.\n\nJust trying out my own thing and fine tuning it to what I hope works best for me.

I'm the type of solo traveller who takes trips alone to specific dream destinations that I'd want to experience on my own the first time around - I have a list. That said, not all my trips are solo, I do other trips with friends, relatives or a romantic partner. My trips are not more than a month. Then there's the RV type of traveller who is always on the road long-term or short-term, the backpacker or longer term traveller who goes away from their home country for months or years (sometimes even gets jobs along the way) or the solo traveller who has no concrete plans and maybe it's a purpose driven journey (hops from one location to the next) etc. \n\nSo, depending on your personality, reasons, finances, purpose and general circumstances it's not necessarily a solo life. For me it's not.",

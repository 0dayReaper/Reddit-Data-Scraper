It's sadly what can be expected from Google nowadays \ud83e\udd21\n\nIs there an actual international phone plan that won't randomly shut off during extended international travel and fuck me over like Google has done countless times?",

It\u2019s in their TOS and you\u2019re just abusing the service and Google got wise and shut people off for doing it. \n\nThere are no cell provider that will let you keep your US number *and* give you international data for cheap and it\u2019s \ud83e\udd21 to think there is. \n\nGet a local SIM card like everyone else does.",

I can't even tell if OP actually lives in the U.S. based on the wording of the post.\n\nI say this as a current Google Fi user who's had the service for years, live in the U.S. but do several months worth of combined international travel time per year, and (knock on wood), has never got a warning yet. So I imagine OP must be abusing the system pretty hard if this is a recurring thing.\n\nI do agree that Google should be more transparent with time limits and give people on extended abroad stays something to work with, but at least they still hold the number for 2fa while you can find a local SIM for daily use.",

It's more expensive than getting a local SIM in each country, but much more convenient and you can have data right when you land.\n\nMake sure to switch your phone line to a VOIP phone, which you probably already have with Google.",

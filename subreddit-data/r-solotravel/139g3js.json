    "postText": "34 M Indian here. Will be in South Africa for 10 nights (starting 21 May) My core interest is being able to take nice photographs - mostly landscapes and architecture.\n\nWondering if there\u2019s any feedback on my split:\n\n2N Johannesburg\n\n3N Kruger (Manyeleti Reserve, with a side trip to Blyde River Canyon)\n\n2N Franschhoek\n\n3N Cape Town\n\nAre my Johannesburg and Franschhoek stays an overkill? \n\nI do want to keep atleast 1 night in Johannesburg, so that I have some buffer in case my incoming flight is delayed. And if I\u2019m doing 1 night, I might as well give the city some justice and pack in a full day of sightseeing. \n\nAs for Franschhoek, I found it quite pretty and wouldn\u2019t mind being able to catch a sunset/sunrise there.\n\nAlso, is driving solo a good idea considering safety, load shedding, and gas prices? Domestic flights seem pretty expensive so was considering renting out of Johannesburg and Cape Town. Will an Indian license (its in English) work (the law seems to say it should) or is an IDP recommended?",

I'm not usually a fan of driving but the Western Cape was a joy. I loved it. Franshoek is beautiful, absolutely don't blame you for wanting to go there. There's a lot of nice towns in that area. Fuel is not too expensive. Sounds like a great trip, enjoy!",

Hoi An is worth exactly 3 days, especially if you like to look good. \n\nYou also should never leave only 1 day before your flight in Vietnam. If you're delayed 1 day into Hanoi due to flooding or train derailment, don't miss your flight out.",

            "comment": "So my two cents on your trip, coming from me who's been to VN over 18+ times throughout my lifetime.\n\nSaigon (TPHCM) is awesome. I stay there the most and is my central hub whenever I do go back since I have family there.  You will run out of things to do eventually. Its a big city. Unless your goal is to eat and party and stuff, there isn't much outside of the main attractions once you see them. If you do plan on doing the night life, especially the touristy areas/traps like Bui Vien (walking street), watch your shit. People will jack your shit lol. \n\nI really like Hue, so if you can, stop by Hue. The food there is unreal. If I were to move to VN, it would be between Saigon (TPHCM) and Hue. If you can speak vietnamese or at least have an ear for it, you'll see how different the accents are between each region you are going to. Hue and Hanoi people are a different breed lol.\n\nAlthough Nha Trang is a famous beach in VN, there really are other ones you can go to.  Honestly, you can maybe shorten Nha Trang to 2 days and leave the 2nd day for a day trip or an evening ride somewhere else. My family used to go to Lang Co a lot, its close to Hue. There is also Vung Tau which is really close to Saigon (TPHCM), this is where my family goes to a lot on their holidays. But this beach is not exactly the cleanest and is more of a beach hub for a lot of local Viets. If you want clean waters and stuff, try Lang Co.   You may get the same out of Nha Trang depending on where you are. I have yet to go to Phu Quoc, which is an island off the coast of VN, but I do want to go.  There is a lot of culture and history with Phu Quoc Island. \n\nDa Nang is nice, have a couple friends there. Food is good, especially the seafood. Ba Na hills is meh.  If it is your first time, ok go for it, get your photos with the hands bride and enjoy the area. But it is kind of weird having a Medieval times sort of amusement park at the top of the mountains in the middle of Vietnam.  Threw me off a bit. Literally. Its like medieval times. \n\nHoi An is cool and I can spend maybe 2 days max there, its pretty small and you'll get the vibe and everything you need out of it after the second day. If you do decide to go for a day, go more towards the afternoon/evening and stay for a little bit of the night, the lanterns come out and its a sight to see. Also, try not to go during peak monsoon season, you won't get much enjoyment out of the city. \n\nI personally have not done the Phong Nha caves, but it is now on my list whenever I go back. Hanoi is cool.  A lot of tourists there. Especially at the touristy areas like Ta Hien. This is where all the bars and stuff are. Also the main lake in the center, a lot of people gather around there.   \n\nI have yet to do this but, if I could, look into a multi-day/night cruise in Ha Long Bay.  You basically sleep on the  boat and spend a night out in Ha Long bay.  \n\nThe one place I have not been to and I want to go to on my next trip back to the motherland, is Sapa. Look up Sapa. It's a village/town way up north to the northern tip of VN.\n\nAs of right now, your itinerary is a really \"go, go, go\" type of mentality.  You may burn yourself out and not get to enjoy much of what each area has to offer.  I would consider narrowing down your destinations a bit.  If sights, food, and culture is your goal, then you may be able to do it all, but if you also plan on experiencing the night life, no f\\^#\\*&amp;% way will you be able to fit all this and not be hung over lol.\n\nI have a family member that runs a tour company in VN stationed out of Saigon.  If you need help or want an itinerary made for you lmk.  Their packages can include, a guide, meals, hotels, and transportation (flights and car).  The company is call FidiTour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps and let me know if you have any questions, Enjoy your trip!",

It made my day reading this. \n\nI am looking forward to the nightlife and I understand the need to not rush the trip, so i will remove nha trang and increase my days in hue/ hoi an. \n\nI have read that june is not the right time for phu quoc so i did not even consider it. \n\nThe first time vietnam visitor in me does not want to skip golden bridge, phong nha caves, ha long bay. I can manage only one trip a year so i want to fit in the most experiences of vietnam that i can. I was excited about the tunnels but now i am reconsidering it if it helps make the trip more comfortable. \n\nThank you so much for sharing their reference.

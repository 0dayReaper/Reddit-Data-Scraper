            "comment": "I was in Amsterdam in early April for five and a half days, and it was the perfect length of time to see almost everything I wanted to see. Here are my tips:\n\n- The Anne Frank House is very worth the visit, but you need to book it well in advance. I set a reminder on my phone for the day that tickets would be released (6 weeks ahead of time). Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh also need to be booked ahead. \n\n- I took a day trip to the Keukenhof gardens as I was there during tulip season. The gardens were gorgeous but so incredibly crowded that it was almost unbearable. The best part was walking around the tulip fields, which are outside the garden walls and therefore most people don't walk around them. \n\n- Public transportation is easy, but not really necessary if you enjoy walking. I took a tram twice the entire time I was there: once on the way from the train station to my hotel when I first arrived, and then the same in reverse on the way out with my bag. But bring comfortable walking shoes! I walked 15 miles one day. \n\n- The city is incredibly walkable, and pretty much every street and canal within the main canal rings are beautiful. Don't just stick to the center area near the train station; go into the Jordaan and the De Pijp neighborhoods. Don't get the Iamsterdam card just for the public transportation part if you like walking, as it won't be necessary. \n\n- This is a tip I saw on the Amsterdam sub \u2014 only buy stroopwafles fresh at markets or where you can see them being made, or in packages at stores. Lots of the places in the touristy areas that have pre-made waffles will leave them out all night and are prone to pest problems. The fresh stroopwafles at the Albert Cuypmarket were amazing, but I didn't wait on the long line for the famous stall; I got one at another one a block down with no line. \n\n- My favorite museum besides Van Gogh was the Our Lord in the Attic house \u2014 a 17th century canal house with a full Catholic church built into the attic, from the time when openly practicing Catholicism was banned. I'm not religious and I found it absolutely fascinating. It was also the least crowded museum I visited. \n\n- The canal boat tour I took was through Those Dam Boat Guys and was very fun, though mostly because the other passengers were great and we chatted the whole time. The guide was fine, but I would have liked more actual historical context about the city as we went through it. But it was cool to be on a smaller boat (10 people max) that allowed you to bring food and alcohol to enjoy while cruising. \n\n(Also, sorry if this post duplicates; Reddit kept freezing)",

I think it's even cheaper if you are like younger than 28? Picnic at the parks or by a canal and have a beer outside as the world passes you by. Get snacks at Albert Heijn (get the chocolate milk, it's so good). If you are into music, check out a concert at Concertgebouw. Remember to get your drinks that are included in the ticket! I totally forgot to do that but if you go to an evening concert, for example, you will get free drinks before the show and at intermission (sometimes even with some cookies) because as a local said \"it's just easier that way\" and it streamlines everything. I believe they also have free lunchtime concerts every week (you had to prebook when I went so check out when they release tickets). If you are a student, a lot of concerts can be super cheap with student tickets.",

The collection is amazing, and is very intelligently presented with lots of information about the historical context of the works.\n\nAnother highlight was the Verzetsmuseum, which ostensibly covers the Dutch resistance during World War II. It was actually focused on Dutch life during the occupation, and was very  moving.

The boat canal tour was nice, as I wrote but nothing else. It doesn\u2019t have great monuments or taste of history or great food or great weather or \u2026.. etc. It not cheaper than many European cities. I can name 10 European cities that are better and more beautiful than Amsterdam.",

I found Amsterdam to be absolutely fascinating and beautiful \u2014 and the canals and canal houses themselves were the coolest attraction, I think. Plus the incredible museums. \n\nIt felt very different from other cities in Europe to me, in a good way.",

Also try avoid the main shopping street it gets extremely busy but if you want to escape it you can go one or two streets over and it\u2019s a completely different vibe. \n\nExploring Jordaan is a must, easily my favourite place in the whole city.\nIn terms off food I would recommend Toastable Nieuwendijk for breakfast.",

Best museums IMO are the Van Gogh and Dutch Resistance Museum (don\u2019t miss this if you have a couple hours). Day trips to Zaanse Schans and Marken - both are really easy to get to on public transportation. I love wandering around Vondel Park and have a favorite spot nearby to stop for bitterballen and kaasstengels with a cold beer afterwards.",

Van Gogh museum is the best museum I've ever been to.\n\n\\- Boat tours are really fun, but be sure to get into smaller boats without roofs.\n\n\\- Supermarkets have really decent and very cheap meals, like Caesar salad for only 3-4 euros. It's good when you don't wanna spend a lot money and time in restaurants and just to eat something that isn't fast food on the go.\n\n\\- They have special offer in May for Micropia + Zoo + some museum (forgot the name) for the price of a Zoo ticket. Didn't have strength to go to the museum, but Micropia and Zoo were well worth it. Zoo is small, but really nice and you're in a park basically. Micropia is just super fun.\n\n\\- Public transport is great if you're outside city center, which is very walkable.",

They're super cheap (about 10 euros a day, but tbh I didn't really do a ton of research so you could probably get one cheaper) and Amsterdam is super fun to bike around. You can even get out of the city pretty easily (they had maps at the shop where I rented the bike).",

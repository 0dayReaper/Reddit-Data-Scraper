    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am visiting France this summer for a study abroad program and booked a little tour around before to explore some as my program is in Arles. My plan was to fly into Paris on the 9th through Stockholm, take a train to Strasbourg and stay until the 12th, then go to Mulhouse until my program begins on the 15th. I've already booked hotels for those nights and bought an SNCF youth card before noticing I might have a slight problem. \n\nMy flight lands at 18:50 on the 9th. The last train from Paris to Strasbourg I see is at 20:25 from Gare de l'Est which is about an hour by subway from the airport. I need to get to Strasbourg that night or I'm slightly screwed. Does anyone have any experience and think I could make it to the train? If I understand correctly I shouldn't have to go through customs again since I'll be connecting through an EU country and I won't be checking any bags. \n\nAdditionally, if I try to make the train and miss it does anyone have suggestions for what to do? Can I transfer my train ticket? Should I call the hotel and attempt to get a refund for the one night? Any input would really be appreciated, thank you!",

Alter your Strasbourg hotel so they don't think you're a no-show.",

            "comment": "That connection time is almost certainly not going to work. Even if you take a taxi to the train station, it's too short to be viable due to the typically bad traffic from the airports in Paris and in the centre of the city (my colleagues in Paris allow 2 hours for taxis to and from the airport from central Paris when they are planning travel - the travel time can often be quicker than this, but they need to assume it will be about 2 hours). You will need to move to an earlier flight, or overnight in Paris and travel to Strasbourg the next day. \n\nThere are frequent trains between Paris and Strasbourg and it's a fairly quick trip, so you should be able to make the trip in the morning and not loose much of your planned time in Strasbourg - which is a great city.",

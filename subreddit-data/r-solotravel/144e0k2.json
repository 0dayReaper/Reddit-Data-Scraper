Do you have bad experiences with lost suitcases, delayed/cancelled trips? Good experiences are welcomed as well!",

Bring movies on a tablet, a book to read, enough snacks, maybe a sleeping mask and noise canceling headphones. I never used the toilet on the bus so I can\u2019t comment on that. Bring your phone charger, so you can charge your phone on the bus if you use it a lot. The wifi is often lacking. \nI had delays up to an hour but that was only once. Other times it was \u201conly\u201d 20 minutes. I got a text message though and the app notifies you if that\u2019s going to be the case. \n\nActually going to hop on a Flixbus tomorrow (only 4h). \n\nWishing you a safe journey!",

Sometimes leaving at the right time but still having a delayed arrival.\n\nThey stop every 2-3 hours or so for bathroom breaks. Don't expect anything luxurious like plugs or toilet on board.\n\nThe legroom is not great, not terrible. If you are tall I would suggest an aisle seat. Some people also book seats so do expect that some might ask you to move if you sit in their seat. Most people don't though.\n\nI would advise on getting at the bus 20-30 mins before leaving. I don't know much about luggage fees, as I usually had backpacks. I do remember once in Croatia when the driver asked a person for extra money because he didn't pay for a huge luggage.",

I would have preferred minimal breathable clothing that doesn't bunch, like workout clothes, and a light blanket or two for comfort and in case if the bus had chilly AC.\n\nAlso, timing. I remember one night climbing onto a bus at midnight in Italy and it was a full bus with sweltering hot, stale air. I had to climb over a sleeping person to sit down. Not sure how I possibly slept but woke up in a pool of my own sweat in the morning. If you book for a smart departure time you'd have a better chance at settling in.",

I never had a \u201cbad\u201d experience, but yes there are delays occasionally, sometimes an hour or more. Depending on the time of your travel, the bus driver may make a few longer stops where you can use a washroom and whatnot if I recall correctly. In terms of the actual bus\u2014 I can\u2019t remember anything being too bad, the seats are OK enough, the washroom is tiny and usually icky. The wifi was so-so usually. \n\nI did travel with a large suitcase a few times and it was fine but obviously I\u2019d advise to keep anything valuable with you in the seating area. \n\nI would recommend keeping your valuables such as your laptop/ phone in a personal bag near your feet if you plan to fall asleep. One time I was on an overnight flixbus and we made a stop in the middle of the night somewhere in Germany and many passengers were understandably asleep. Those of us who were awake did not realize it at the time but a random man had boarded the bus while it was stopped and quickly stole a passenger\u2019s backpack/laptop/phone that she had left on the seat next to hers (she was asleep). It was traumatic for her and the bus driver couldn\u2019t do anything about it once we realized what happened! So just be mindful.",

I find FlixBus is not always the best. \n\nTook an overnight Megabus from London to Paris, but they go on a ferry - plenty of room to roam or snooze on the ferry with free meal. It was way cheaper than FlixBus but it arrived an hour late so missed my prepaid train to Geneva. Luckily, no additional charge to get the next train. Some routes on train are about similar price as buses, depending on the time of the day.\n\nWill be taking an overnight bus from Copenhagen to Oslo next month. Vy Buss takes an hour less with no stops - probably for toilet and driver break, but no city stops for pick ups like FlixBus - cheaper, and more room, and option to sit in a single seat.",

    "postText": "I landed in Milan with a hostel booked for a week and tickets to the Gran Prix, but no other plans.\n\nWhen I first entered the hostel I heard three people talking my native language, but couldn't get myself to approach them.\n\nAfter about an hour staying in my room playing mobile games, I decided to go to one of the common areas and talk to someone. \n\nWithout noticing, I spent three hours talking to people, laughing and telling jokes. We even decided to go to a bar and I spent the whole night with my new friends.\n\nThis has really turned me around, and from my old timid self emarged a new person that felt comfortable for the first time.\n\nI really can't emphasize how huge the change was. Two days ago someone complimented me for always having a smile, which is something I have never heard before.\n\n\nThis is just my experience, and I know everyone will have a different one, but I really encourage everyone to take the first step and approach someone in a hostel and start chatting with them. You just might start smiling for the first time in years because of that.",

            "comment": "Thanks for the trip down memory lane. This reminded me of my first night out with a bunch of strangers that I met in a hostel bar in Brussels back in 2013. They were all Croatians and were on a field trip across Europe as part of their studies. I got talking with one of them by making a comment about the Redbull X-Game (which was on a TV at the bar). I didn't even care for the games, I was just making conversation, but anyway it lead to me going out with all of them to a local bar and having a great time.\n\nThe vast vast majority of people you meet on the road will be friendly and open to making new friends. Assholes are few and far between. Don't be shy and if you ever see a group of people sitting together at a table just sit down and say something like \"Hey, can I join you guys?\" Most will be happy to meet you.\n\nAlso, a few tips. Say hi to everyone when you arrive in a dorm room. If you're heading out for a bite to eat or just to walk around, ask someone if they'd like to join you. Find ways to initiate conversations while also doing your own thing. For me, it was journaling and photography. If I was working on something at a hostel someone would almost inevitably ask me about it and before long I had a new friend or group of friends. [Couchsurfing.com](https://Couchsurfing.com) was also a really useful way to meet people when I found myself mostly alone in a new city. It's not just for finding a free couch but also for meeting locals. Though I have heard the site is not as good as it used to be and maybe there are alternatives by now.\n\nAlso, if you normally veer towards being an introvert, don't feel bad if you sometimes need a bit of time to yourself. I made that mistake a few times where I surrounded myself with people for several days straight until I got burned out. We all need a little alone time to recharge, nothing wrong with that. \n\nBest of luck with the rest of your travels, I know that once you get started it can be a little hard to stop. I left home about 8 years ago and still haven't been back yet.",

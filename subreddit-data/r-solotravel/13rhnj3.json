I try to tell myself that they've touched my life and I've touched theirs and hopefully we came out of it slightly changed and can carry that with us through life somehow. We are a collection of our experiences and I'm grateful that I was able to share a brief moment with someone that was beautiful, even though it was brief....also remembering, we all have to say goodbye to each other at some point, to everybody, to things...so much of life is about letting go and realizing that nothing lasts forever.",

I used to wish to pause time in certain moments of my life, but realized that things will eventually change, and will always appreciate each and every experience.",

You may double check your alarms, or set it a little earlier, or even just be a bit more wary about your alarm. \n\nWe carry every experience with us. You may not remember every single person you met. They may not remember you, but everything still happened, and it still colors our view of the world. \n\nMaybe you hung out at a club with someone and heard a song. Next time they hear that song, they may think of that night, or you. They carry you with them\n\nYou may go out to eat with a group, then whenever you eat pizza, you remember and smile. You carry them with you. \n \nThere are amazing people out there, and it\u2019s great to be apart of their story, even for one night. And even if you don\u2019t connect with them forever, that memory still effects them even when they aren\u2019t thinking about it. \n\nI try to remember that. They\u2019ll remember you, and you\u2019ll remember them. Your stories wouldn\u2019t be the same if you hadn\u2019t met.

Plus, with social media and all, *it\u2019s so easy* to keep contact with folk - it\u2019s not like up until a few decades ago when you really often could be unlikely to ever hear of or see them around anywhere again.  Haha, nEveR goNNa sEE thEm aGaiN - so dramatic.    \n\nAlready like 8 or 9 years ago old wrinkly travellers from the 60\u2019s, 70\u2019s &amp; 80\u2019s started up facebook groups for travellers from those days, slowly slowly people found the group (the ones still left alive that is) &amp; joined it.  I\u2019ve found people I partied with on Koh Phangan in the mid 80\u2019s with, or travelled the Himalayas or went to festivals in Spain with, and lost touch with due to internet &amp; social media not even really existing back then.  We\u2019d send postcards to or call peoples parents, to find out where they were or get news of them, organise crossing paths again.  It\u2019s fun having the possiblity to sm contact sometimes, catch up what folk are doing and so on.  So many people travel so easily these days - you\u2019ll see folk again.",

These people you want to keep forever. \nYou promise to keep in touch and for a short time you do! Then the messages become smaller and smaller. How are you doing? How is life? You realize that their life keeps on, they become busy with work or family or new countries until one day, you don\u2019t seem to know them anymore. So you stop messaging and you just look at their Instagram pictures and feel happy for them. Then one day, their birthday pops up and you realize you haven\u2019t checked their page in awhile and you wish them happy birthday, they say thank you and they become just another friend on your list. \nOne day you\u2019ll be cleaning out your things and come across a little elephant or bracelet that they gifted you. You think of them and go back to those carefree days, then you tuck it back in with all your other treasures with a smile, and your heart is thankful for having met them.",

It's strange as you can become very close to people fast because of the environment we put ourselves in. We travel alone but still want to meet and connect with people which makes.us connect faster but then the connection is gone. You have to find new connections again and again. You met some people at the hostel because friends they went X you went Y. Find new people at the next place your at. But if your on a similar route you may meet up again with people and the more people you know more likely you meet people again.\n\nMaybe that was just as bad as the way someone explained it to me but ye, I found it weird as well lol",

I\u2019ve said goodbye a hundred times to hundreds of backpackers I\u2019ve met all over the world so I\u2019m totally desensitized at this point. I think that travel connections are overly romanticized anyway. I\u2019ve done like 7 or 8 reunions on my last trip with travelers i met on my previous trips, and most of them were just\u2026 okay? Like, we didn\u2019t hug each other crying our eyes out or anything. It was more like \u201cgreat to see you again, bro, how have you been\u201d and then \u201cmaybe i see you somewhere else in the world, take care\u201d.\n\nThe majority of these fleeting connections are not life-changing (unless you spent your whole life in a cave and these are the first people you interacted with). Many of these people wouldn\u2019t be your friends if you met them outside of the traveling environment because really with many of them you only have one thing in common - traveling, and there is only that much time you can talk about it before getting bored. \n\nIt\u2019s great in the moment and let it stay like this. Travel friendship is like a beautiful butterfly trapped in amber: it\u2019s so beautiful because it\u2019s frozen in time and it doesn\u2019t progress until its natural decline.",

Its like having two groups of friends. One group likes to stay at home and the other group likes to go out to clubs. Thats the relationship I have with both of those groups and its fine to keep them in those types of groups.",

And I'd say that's one of the fun things about backpacking/solo travel; It's an opportunity to meet interesting people from all over the world that you most likely would never have met staying at home. Some travel friendships were only meant to last a few days or a few weeks, while others may become genuine years-long friendships. Both are awesome.",

I spent 3 semesters on campus, 2 semesters at home because of COVID, one semester living with my sister across the country, one semester studying abroad, and the last semester interning abroad. Because of this, I've had my fair share of getting close to people and having to leave. \n\nI never really got close to anyone on campus because I was freshly 18 and still learning how to exist in the world on my own. However, the semester I spent across the country was the first time I've gotten close to someone and had to leave. I'd go so far as to call it my first real heartbreak. However, it was amazing while I was there and I'm glad that I experienced it. I grew so much from meeting that person and I hold it close to my heart as my \"hallmark moment.\"\n\nWhen I studied abroad, I met my best friend. If you really want to see the people you meet abroad again, you will. We cried and cried when we had to leave each other, but we saw each other again. She visited me my next semester abroad and I plan on visiting her at the end of this year on her next semester abroad. If you really want to see someone again, you will.\n\nAs for my semester interning abroad, I made short amazing friendships that were only meant to be temporary. I think thats what makes a lot of friends made while traveling so special, they're suspended in time. They were never meant to last forever and the impermanence is what makes them so lovely.\n\nWhile it does hurt, it's something we must adapt to. The people that are meant to stay in your life will, but some people are only meant to be a fond memory.",

The mindset to set in the very beginning of travel or meeting people is important.  To meet people, it can be full of surprise and you might meet people who you'd get very closed with, but it's all temporary and enjoy these little moment while you all still have it together. Just enjoy the moment with them and know that you will meet new people again, and this time bring happiness to other people.\n\nSame in life, we don't really appreciate much things because we know they're there forever(just what we thought). It's a great reminder we should care more about the one who's really there all the time for us. We often take them for granted.",

As for people I met travelling and truly enjoyed, I haven't kept in touch after all these years, but when I feel the sadness, I remind myself how some people are only met to touch our lives for a short time; others will be there for the long haul.

    "postText": "Hi, i'm currently planning a trip in Ecuador for the end of the July and i was wondering about the best itinary in order to experience different things without rushing everything.\n\nAt the moment, i was thinking about spending 1 day in Quito (arriving) and then 1 in Otavalo in order to see the markets ----- going for a 3 days hike around Quilotoa ------- 2 days in Ba\u00f1os ----- and finally coming back in Quito for 1 day to take my plane the next day. \n\nHow does that itinary seems to be according to you?\n\nAnother question i have is about hotel/hostel. Is it better to book before hand or i would be able to do it there?\n\nIt's my first solo travelling experience so i want to come with a solid plan for myself.\n\nThanks everyone!",

With your given itinerary you may want to consider a walking tour and the cable cars in Quito over Otavalo. In general you may also want to consider a tour into the Amazon (one of my highlights) and Cotopaxi.\n\nWith only 8 days I\u2019d recommend booking your hostels in advance as you have very little room for flexibility. \n\nMy hostel recs:\nQuito- The Secret Garden\nBanos- The Great Hostels\nQuilotoa Loop- Llullu Llama and Hostal Cloud Forest",

But I think secret garden Quito I think is *highly* overrated.",

I would also shorten time spent at Quilotoa (not much to do in town) and extend your stay in Banos and take a day trip out to Puyo (Amazon).\n\nIt seems like every hotel/hostel I stayed at had some vacancies so I think you should be able to book there. July is supposed to be busier though, so not sure if that will change by the time you get there.\n\nHope you have lots of fun!",

I went up the Teleferico very early, then joined a walking tour. For me personally that was sufficient. And yes, also agree that the secret garden Quito is overrated. Cotopaxi was fantastic though.\n\nWith limited time you could also consider just day trips from Quito.\n\nHave fun!",

            "comment": "I did something similar in 2018 but think it was 9 days. We did not make it to Otavalo as we did a day hike to the Refugio on Cotopaxi and spent that evening in Latacunga. The Quilotoa trek is really a lot of fun. You could start further down the road and do a single overnight if you\u2019re set on an overnight hike. Latacunga was a really surprised us and had a slight European feel to it. 2 days in Ba\u00f1os is good if you don\u2019t go further into the rainforest. Little touristy but we did a canyoning trip out of ba\u00f1os. It was nice to be able to interact with the rain forest in a unique way.\n\nAgree with other posters that Quito was a bit underwhelming, but still good for 1-2 days. There are some good hikes on the western side of the city to acclimatize if you decide to spend time on Cotopaxi. \n\nEcuador is a gem of a country. Hope you enjoy your trip!",

            "comment": "You\u2019re in the same boat as I was. Trips too long for Quito area only but too short to stray far away. Some thoughts:\n\n1) minimize your time in Quito. Go straight from the airport to Mindo and see the cloud forest. Skip the textile market. Then head south to Ba\u00f1os and make that your base for waterfalls and Cotopaxi. Then head to Quito for one or two nights max. Unless you are heavily into museums, you can see everything you need in Quito in one day and certainly one and a half days. It\u2019s a little slow here right now and even the locals are talking about how dangerous it is. \n\nOr\n\n2) make Quito your homebase for a week and definitely pre-book your hotel. Stay away from the tourist areas like Centro Hist\u00f3rico which is desolate at night and difficult to find transportation. And stay away from La Mariscal sucre, which is loud and hectic and dangerous. La Floresta is a great area to stay. From Quito you can book day trips, both north and south, to see everything that you want to see. And you can book it based on weather because your ability to enjoy these things is going to be heavily dependent on the Weather which is volatile\n\nMy two cents. I know many people will tell you that going to Ba\u00f1os or Cotopaxi for a day trip is not ideal and they are 100% right. But you are dealing with a time constraint here. I\u2019m thinking about doing one of those day trips tomorrow and if I do I\u2019ll report back and let you know how I felt about it.\n\nQuick update: I just booked a day trip to Laguna Quilotoa at the travel agency for less than I was seeing online. They have day trips to Ba\u00f1os but the lady steered me away as ba\u00f1os deserves more time than that",

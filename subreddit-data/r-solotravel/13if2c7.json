Thinking about spending the whole time in Spain. \n\nLooking for feedback on my itinerary and any hidden gems/must sees I may have missed, as well recommendations for any standout hostels/budget accommodations you've stayed at, as some cities don't have many listings on sites like Hostelworld. \n\nLooking to build a slow-ish paced trip, no car, with a good balance between sightseeing and relaxing. \n\n6/29 - 7/2 (3 nights) - Fly into London to see a friend\n\n7/3 - 7/7 (5 nights) - San Sebastian (Bilbao, Biarritz, or Pamplona?)\n\n7/8 - 7/12 (4 nights) - Madrid (day trip to Toledo)\n\n7/13 - 7/16 (3 nights) - Seville \n\n7/16 - 7/19 + Cadiz, Terifa, Marbella, Malaga?\n\n7/19 - 7/21 (2 nights)  - Granada\n\n7/21 - 7/22 (1 night) - Alicante (fly to Mallorca or Ibiza?)\n\n7/22 - 7/30 (9 nights) - Balearic Islands \n\n7/30 - 8/1 (2 nights) - Paris\n\n8/1 - Fly home",

            "comment": "Hey! A Spanish guy here. I'd include C\u00f3rdoba as well, a must see. Marbella is not bad, but it's luxury city, IMO you will enjoy M\u00e1laga more. C\u00e1diz might be the hidden gem you are looking for and it's prefect for relaxing. Do you like beaches? If so, C\u00e1diz won't disappoint you.\n\nYou are going on top season in Spain, not the most budget friendly but I guess you know that.\n\n9 days in Islas Baleares seems too much. I mean is touristic and it has beautiful places, but seems like a lot to me. Ibiza is well known for partying.\n\nAny questions you can let me know!",

Literally looking to chill all day, enjoying my own company on the beach or by a pool in the sunshine whilst sipping a cold beer &amp; a good book. Not a party animal myself so somewhere peaceful enough. Not looking to spend a crazy amount too. Where would you recommend for me to go/stay for a solo trip to Spain without breaking the bank. If you could recommended me some destinations/places that you think would be ideal for a relaxed solo beach holiday then that would be more than appreciated. \n\nAlso do you think it\u2019s worth just booking a all inclusive to Spain - preferably resorts located near good beaches? This way accommodation &amp; food is sorted. Usually a traveller by nature who likes to explore (never done a Spain all inclusive trip) but just thinking of what\u2019s the most convenient option. Let me know your thoughts please &amp; if you know any ideal locations for relaxed resorts?\n\nThanks \ud83e\udd18",

                            "comment": "Hello Gandalf! \n\nThere is a tradeoff here between being close to bars and having a lot of space with almost no people in the beach.\n\nFor example, in M\u00e1laga the beaches are not that extraordinaire, but you can rent a hammock in a chiringuito (\"chiringuito\" = beach bar/restaurant) for 5\u20ac per day,  order drinks and read there, super relaxed. Zero complications from your side, everything will be easy. Then when you are tired of the day in the beach you can enjoy the city in the evening by doing a pleasant walk in the city center, see the streets, the parks... Sounds like a really good plan to me.\n\nNow if you feel more like \"I want to be alone and unbothered\": In the C\u00e1diz province (from Tarifa to Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda) you have beautiful long and wide beaches where even in high season there is a lot of space among people. A bit windy sometimes but super chill. Definitely affordable, I spent part of my last summer there and I loved it. Maybe you won't have Chiringuitos that close and the access to the good beaches requires some kind of transport, you can not go by walk that easily like M\u00e1laga.\n\nRelaxed resorts all-included... Definitely I won't pay for that. Spain is safe, affordable (beer quite cheap), good food, friendly... I think you will miss the essence of it if you go to an all-included. And we are not very good with English, but people will understand you in bars, restaurants and accommodation.",

            "comment": "Having San Sebastian as your home base for five days is awesome. You can easily do a day trip into France and see Biarritz (and even St. Jean de Luz, if you have time). You can also do a day trip to Bilbao, and on the way stop by Axpe to eat at Asador Etxebarri. San Sebastian is one of my favorite places. Beautiful beaches, some hiking, really relaxing. But most of all, THE FOOD! On the pricey side, there are five three-star Michelin restaurants. But honestly, while I went to one, not my thing. There are PLENTY of great places that are casual stand-only and nicer sit-down (but much more affordable than a 3-star). My fave was probably La Cuchara de San Telmo. A standing-only Pintxo place. If you need any more food recs for San Sebastian (or Sevilla, Ronda, or Barcelona), let me know.\n\nIn the South, between Sevilla and Granada is a really charming town called Ronda. You only need to stay a day and stay overnight, but it's a great stop. I didn't do Cadiz, et al, so can't speak to those.\n\nI noticed you didn't include Barcelona? Any particular reason? I really enjoyed Barcelona (but it could be because it was my first city in Europe ever). Lots of art, food, architecture, and beaches.",

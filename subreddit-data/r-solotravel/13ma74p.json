    "postText": "I am looking at Sail Croatia tours and leaning towards a Cycling tour.  I am late 30's so I don't think the younger party cruises would be for me.  But I am solo, so I do like the idea of a bit of partying, but I also like getting out to really doing stuff, and hangovers would be a bummer.  My concern is when I look at some of the cycling videos of these tours, the crowd definitely seems older and maybe retired.  I bet I could have a good time with an older crowd, but, you know, peers would be cool.\n\nThe tour I am currently leaning toward is the south of Split island sail and cycle tour.\n\nAny input and experience is definitely appreciated.  thanks",

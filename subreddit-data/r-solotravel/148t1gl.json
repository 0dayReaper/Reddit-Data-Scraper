Border officials will though, and may refuse you entry if you try to enter their country on a passport you invalidated by allowing novelty stamps to be placed in it. Get a replacement passport before you next travel internationally.",

In the future, I won't get unofficial stamps, simply to avoid worrying about such trivialities, but I crossed many borders on that passport and no one cared.",

            "comment": "I recommed to follow /u/Appropriate_Volume's advice.\n\nAs for the context of the situation:  \nBorder control can be fickle; they may check your stamp history to check where you've been (recently, and when traveling with the same passport). If they want a reason to reject you, such a stamp gives them a plausible cause. \n\nSomehwat recently (i.e., over 2 decades ago), there was a case or two that birthed \"Terminal\" the movie: people being stranded at the airport because they were denied immigration and had no access to a flight out.\n\nPassenger rights were extended to force airlines taking care of such passengers To reduce that cost, checking validity of documents is now often mandatory at checkin or gate (before, it was \"more of a service\"). \n\nThis is a very fun activity, because a perosn with a passport issued by country A boards a plane in country B and wants to immigrate to country C, possibly with a layover in country D. There's almost 200 countries in the world, and especially during Corona, the rules for immigration could change daily -  and some passangers insist that this was not a problem last time (8 years ago with a different layover) why should it be now?\n\nThat's a good enough reason why airlines will not check to thoroughly (cost of checking mut not exceed cost of additional transport in case of rejection), but may be over-eager with the checks sometimes. \n\nWhich is why I'd say: even if the chance of being denied boarding or immigration, better get a new passport.",

He was granted refugee papers via Belgium - and apparently wanted to settle in the UK where he claimed he was descended from and had family.\n\nHis papers were allegedly stolen while in transit between Paris and London - so when he arrived in London, he was rejected and returned to Paris CDG. In Paris he wasn't able to present identification papers either so he wasn't allowed to enter France either - but he couldn't be returned to his country of origin (Iran) because according to his claim, he had been ejected and so under international law, he could not be forcibly returned. So he was stuck in transit areas.\n\nAnd actually it seems he may have had some additional issues - he was offered a few options on ways to get new paperwork or be allowed entry to France and Belgium but he rejected them. And some of his claims about his family and background seemed to change frequently (and misalign with records). For example, both offers of residency in France and Belgium he rejected because they listed him as Iranian - when he claimed to be British (despite all evidence indicating no British lineage) and did not list him by his alleged name and title (his name was Mehran Karimi Nasseri and he refused to sign the paperwork by that name, insisting he was actually a titled lord by the name Alfred Mehran). He claimed his father was British at one point (though all records indicate his father was Iranian, though working for a British-Iranian company). Then claimed his mother was Scottish. Then that she was actually Swedish.",

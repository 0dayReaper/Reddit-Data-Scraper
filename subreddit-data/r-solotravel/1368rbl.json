    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm planning a trip starting from South America and working my way up to Central America. I'm still writing down different countries/cities I want to visit so I don't have a timeline yet, but definitely aiming for over a month overseas. I solo traveled to Thailand recently where I stayed for a month and I had created a whole itinerary that I stuck to, but sometimes it did me a disservice when I made friends and wanted to join in on their itinerary or when I overstayed certain islands I got bored.\n\nMy question is, **how prepared should I be when I travel to the Americas and what should I be prepared for?** Some people I've talked to have said they completely \"winged\" their itinerary and just flew to a country and would book hostels/hotels that same day or night, *or* randomly decide to catch a bus to go to the next country over. How doable is this in South America? I know in my experience in SEA, transportation was so easy you could definitely \"plan as you go\". I'm also leaning towards approaching my trip with a \"plan as you go\" mentality since I overwhelm myself when I over-plan trips.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCountries I'm planning on visiting for example (not in order):\n\nBuenos Aires and Patagonia, Argentina\n\nRio De Janiero and Sao Paulo, Brazil\n\nAntigua, Guatemala\n\nGrenada, Nicaragua\n\nand more, but these are just examples.",

Unless you\u2019re going elsewhere than Calafate/Chalten/Torres/Ushuaia/etc. Also BA for that matter.\n\nRio will only really be difficult during New Years, Carnival and other holidays like that.\n\nDunno about the others, I\u2019d assume the same.",

            "comment": "I think winging it is fine, but you should consider limiting this trip to only Central OR South America, and then pick 2 or 3 countries to focus on. Even for a month, limiting yourself to just the major cities you've listed will leave you missing out on so much.\n\nI'll use Guatemala as an example, since I just spent a week there, and I've been doing lots of research for a second trip. In Antigua, you've mainly got the old colonial ruins and day trips to nearby volcanoes. The country has so much more to offer than that, such as Semuc Champey and the caves in Lanqu\u00edn, the various Mayan ruins around Flores, and the communities and nature around Lake Atitlan. All of the countries you're looking to go to are more than their biggest cities, and you could easily spend a month in any of them.",

I wish I had more time in the year!! But thanks!",

Does brazil require a more intensive visa process)\n\n\nInside a country, the bus system is usually easy and tourist friendly (few connections to get from 1 key tourist place to another). Going from 1 country to another can be surprisingly expensive and long. Flights can be expensive across neighbouring countries and buses may take over a day. But you can definitely wing it especially if you're not trying to cross big distances all the time.",

            "comment": "I think it will depend on if it is high/peak season in the countries you are going. For example, July is usually peak season in Argentina (my country) because of the winter holidays, and December-February is peak season as well due to summer holidays, and both are times where the locals travel across the country. \n\nAlso, consider that the distances between all the places you've mentioned is huge, specially in South America and is not so possible to \"wing it\". For example, for going from Buenos Aires to Sao Paulo you will have to fly, it's more than 2200 km. Inside Argentina distances are big too, so for example a bus from BA to Bariloche could easily take 24hs (and Calafate/Chalten is even more far) - so as you'll have to take flights the best would be to book them in advanced or the prices can get ridiculous over here. You can definitely just book the flights and leave the itinerary in each city more open to be spontaneous, but bear in mind the peak seasons I mentioned.\n\n\nFor Patagonia would be best to book head, specially if you will be taking any special tours in the Patagonia like Glacier hiking or going to Chalten or things like that. Once in Patagonia you can move around by bus but as I've said consider distances. If you can, besides Patagonia and BA I'd suggest looking into adding Iguaz\u00fa falls to your itinerary  you won't regret it!",

Problem is when you have a limited time to travel, missing a bus can make things complicate.\n\nI do encourage, however, some planning, let's say a few days or a week before crossing borders, for example. I also recommend you getting familiar with the next city you are heading to. I mean, you definitely don't want to arrive in a countryside city in Bolivia in the middle of the night.",

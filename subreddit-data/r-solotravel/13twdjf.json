    "postText": "Solo female. Going to Egypt soon. I'm going on an 8 day tour with G Adventures to see all the highlights, because even though I'm a fairly experienced traveler, I know better than to go to Egypt alone.\n\nHowever, I got a steal of a flight that leaves for home 4 days after the tour ends. That means I have four days in Egypt alone. I was considering taking a flight to Sharm el Sheik and going to Dahab for four days. Have any other solo females been there? So far my research indicates that this area has a much different vibe to it than anywhere else in Egypt.\n\nMy other option is to pay for a private guide to go to Siwa, which also interests me, but Dahab and the water activities currently interest me a lot more.",

            "comment": "Hey there! I'm a solo female traveler and felt perfectly safe in Sharm el Sheikh! The vibe is definitely very different from anywhere else there, probably the safest place in Egypt where I was able to wear a bikini on the beach and walk through the downtown area unbothered. There were tourists everywhere there... I also heard that Dahab is even more laidback with a water sports type of crowd. Definitely recommend, as well as to complete the Moses mountain hike (with a guide or on a tour) to catch the sunrise if that can be of interest to you!",

I went a few years ago with a tour group. The only time I was alone was coming from and returning to the airport in a taxi. I did have a bad experience with being groped in my hotel room by a maintenance worker. I reported it to the tour guide and he wasn't super helpful. \n\nThankfully the rest of the trip passed without incident and it was truly an amazing experience. But I chalk a lot of that up to being in a group and being with a local guide. No-one really bothered or harassed us because he was always with us. \n\nSo I think you made the right decision in going with a group. The 4 alone days might be a bit tricky but Sharm does seem to be an anomaly in Egypt in safety. I'd just advise sticking close to your accommodation while there and if you're doing activities in Dahab go with a guide.",

The famous salt pools are actually construction sites where they mine salt a couple hundred feet away from tourists. I found Siwa to also be very conservative and much less friendly than other oases. Plus, Siwa season is technically over. It\u2019s going to be very hot out there with little options to cool off. The hotels aren\u2019t very equipped since it\u2019s a remote oasis hours from Alexandria and Cairo. \n\nIf you\u2019re doing Egypt in the summer, Dahab is for sure the way to go. It\u2019s a safe town and yes, you can wear anything. It\u2019s full of locals and foreigners alike. Coral Coast hotel is Amazing. So is Acacia. Others are hit or miss with amenities or cleanliness. So read reviews carefully! Enjoy your time in Egypt \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdited to add more content.",

In Luxor and Aswan, people are offering boats, taxis, carriages, tours etc., not taking no for an answer, following you, trying to lead you places or give you information (obviously to ask for money afterwards, etc.). I didn't actually get scammed or really feel unsafe, but I could see how it would happen, especially to a solo female. The one friend we made in Aswan was actually a tourist from Cairo who saw us get quoted 40 pounds for an orange juice and then followed us down the block to offer to buy it for us (it was really only 15 pounds) - we ended up taking a road trip to Abu Simbel with him. Actually, I take it back - we did get scammed in Luxor, by employees of the official We (cell phone) store - for like $0.50, but still, pretty crazy.",

You will be harassed and overcharged for everything without a local guide. \n\nI would say it's safe ish as long as not walking around at night /sketchy areas but you will be non stop hassled by locals to guide you and sell you things and the Egyptians are the most relentless sales people iv ever met on my travels they will surround you and it can be quite uncomfortable. Having a guide will minimize this for the most part from my experience. It's funny how everything drops in price by 50% or more when local comes speakin Arabic. This will be the same for shops/resturants  even government regulated tours. There is a lot of corruption when it comes to tourism there.\n\n\nThat's my 2 cents anyway. I'm sure you will hear different opinions on this sub\n\n\nThat being said have a great trip! Also, make sure to get the street falafel in Luxor best and cheapest falafel iv ever had.",

The original plan was to stay at a hostel, and do my activities (scuba, hiking, etc) with an organized tour every day. So the time i would be alone would be for meals, basically. Was hoping I would meet some people at the hostel to have meals with which would add a second layer of security. I'm not a really a \"wander around\" type of traveler and I'm in bed by 8pm \ud83d\ude42 but I may now consider a tour there from Cairo! Thank you for the input :)",

Be cautious as anywhere, but Cairo is a pretty safe city when you're not trying to cross a road (no crosswalks and traffic is nuts)",

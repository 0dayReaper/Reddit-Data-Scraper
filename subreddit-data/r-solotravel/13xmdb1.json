    "postText": "Hi I am going to be solo traveling in SEA this October for at least 2-3 months while keeping an option to extend. I plan to challenge myself with strenuous exercise and adventure, such as training Muay Thai, climbing mountains, and trekking through jungles. I have recently learned about adventure tours and canyoneering tours that occur in the area (e.g. Northern Vietnam).\n\nBut there are so many tour groups and it is hard to know which ones are better for me, so I was hoping to find someone on this sub who has an experience to share. The more physically demanding, the better. It doesn't have to be all suffering, but I want to have to exert myself in between chill relaxed times. Some things that would interest me on an adventure tour: climbing mountains, jungle trekking, jungle survival skills, spearfishing, cliff jumping, rock climbing, scuba diving/snorkeling. Caves too, but I'm nervous that I'll get caught in a flash flood during wet season...",

            "comment": "So, you're going to have trouble finding really challenging adventure tours anywhere in the world. The nature of tours is that they need to be accessible to a wide range of people, and that lots of people say they are \"fit\" but most people aren't.  This is especially true for any sort of group tours.\n\nIf you want things that are really challenging, you're going to be either doing something like a supported bike tour, where there's a van that can pick up the people who can't hack it.  Or you'll be getting private guides.\n\nBut it also doesn't have to be really challenging to be fun.  You don't want to risk injuring yourself in the jungle in south east asia anyway.  This isn't necessarily the place for an amazing challenge.  I did a fun trip to Thailand that included some urban stuff, but also a couple of day trips from Chiang Mai.  There was a very challenging for me Mountain Biking day trip I did with a local guide company (but all downhill - I just fell a lot), and then an extremely easy kayak trip that I did with the same company.\n\nYou don't have to be in a tour group for many of these things.  A lot of tourist cities have day trips that you can easily sign up for when you get there.  For things like cliff jumping, look for \"canyoneering tours.\" If you're a beginner at these things, day tours will probably be just fine.  If you're already experienced, you'll probably need to get a private guide.",

            "comment": "Ok I've got a few for you.\n\nPeople arriving to visit Ankgor Wat think it's a great idea to bike around and visit the temples.  But what some of them aren't aware of is just how damn hot it can get out there trying to bike from temple to temple.  So my challenge to you is, do the standard 3 day visit to Angkor Wat, and bike around to as visit as many temples as you possibly can, while attempting to avoid sunburn and pure exhaustion.\n\nAnother one is Trekking in Sa Pa - the standard trek where do a Homestay with a local, which is a simple walk to a village some hours away, staying over, and then walking back.  I'm sure if you ask around, you can find someone to take you on a longer more challenging trek through the beautiful hills and rice terraces of Sa Pa Valley.\n\n\\- From Sa Pa valley you can also do the Fansipan Mountain trek, you can look it up to find out more, I've never done. Heard it's very it's extremely challenging.\n\nNear Hanoi is the area of Ninh Binh - there are 2 different boat trips you can do - one is called Tam Coc and the other one is Trang An .  So when you go, you can volunteer to row the boat the whole way.  Could be fun.  You can do a search for Trang An river tour, Ninh Binh\n\nIf you liked those, I'm sure I could think up a few more.\n\nHappy Travels!",

[Hang Son Doong](https://oxalisadventure.com/cave/son-doong-cave/) is the largest limestone cave in the world. There's only one tour company, it's expensive as fuck and is half a week trek to get there and half a week back out.    \nOutside of mainland South East Asia is [Raja Ampat] (https://www.stayrajaampat.com/), it's known for having the healthiest reef systems in the world. 4-5 modes of transport to get there, and if you do it on a budget you get electricity from 6-11pm and that's about it. No shops, no air con, no bar down the road, just you, a hut built over the water and the best accessible underwater world.    \nIf I think of other non-cliche type adventure travel I'll let you know, but these two have always appealed to me.",

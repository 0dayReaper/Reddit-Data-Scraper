An \u201cemergency Replacement passport\u201d would not be accepted in a number of countries and would prevent further travel, so I\u2019m choosing to wait a bit longer so I can get a full replacement and at least see a few more countries. \n\nIt will take a few weeks to get my new passport. Should I have just taken the emergency visa and gone home?",

Don\u2019t live with what ifs. Make friends with the hostel owner and see if they will give you a discounted rate or even let you work there part time, get to know the city you\u2019re stuck in and become a pseudo tour guide for the guests that come and go. I knew all the best places to eat in Phnom Penh by the time the passport arrived.",

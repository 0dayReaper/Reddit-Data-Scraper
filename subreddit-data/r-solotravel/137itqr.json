    "postText": "Hi, This will be my (20M) first solo trip this June and it will be around Europe. have a planned itinerary for this 17 day trip and my budget is 2.5K\u20ac. This itinerary: Fly to Berlin on June 11th and stay there until the 14th. \u2022 Fly to London on the 14th and stay until the 18th. \u2022 Fly to Amsterdam on the 18th and stay until the 21st. \u2022 Arrive in Copenhagen on the 21st and stay til the 24. \u2022 Arrive back in Berlin on the 24th and take a bus to Prague that day and then come back on the 26th. \u2022 Fly home from Berlin on the 27th. Main interests are: Nightlife, Food and Nature and meeting new people! FYI: I have already been in London earlier this month and stayed for a week and I loved it so i've been wanting to come back. The reason that I'm choosing air travel is because it's way much cheaper. I'm planning to stay in hostels and not always eating out.\nWhat should I do differently? Is it a fast paced trip?\nShould I leave a city out? Should I skip anything in the itinerary? Is this a low budget for the trip? Any tips would be welcomed!",

            "comment": "Looks about right to me, and doable. The bus from berlin to prague and back looks a bit iffy why is that there and you can't fly straight to Prague? \n\nConsider buying a ticket to fly home from Prague so you don't have to come back on yourself.\n\nYou could also check some other nearby cities such as Vienna or Budapest instead if you can't find a ticket home from Prague.  (I don't know where you're flying in from but use google flights multi search to find open jaw flights)",

But I might have to see if I can get on a flight from CPH to Prague so I don\u2019t have to go Berlin first and then go to Prague",

            "comment": "If you're interested in nightlife, i would recommend not putting your traveling days in the middle of the weekend. You don't want to be in London or Amsterdam with the pressure of leaving on Sunday. In Berlin, London and Amsterdam, there's of course nightlife every day of the week so maybe you purposely avoided a continuous Friday/Saturday/Sunday stay. Prague also has a great nightlife, especially outside the tourist area but it's daunting to slap travel days so closely together.\n\n\nCopenhagen has the food culture you're looking for but the prices are quite high. You likely have the budget so i might pre book a semi-fancy restaurant now. Copenhagen has a different vibe than your other destinations so it could be something you do at another time.\n\n\nI might suggest this order though\nBerlin &gt; Prague &gt; London &gt; Amsterdam &gt; (Copenhagen) &gt; Berlin \n\n\nI would get Prague out of the way so you're not ending your trip with a bunch of night busses. I would suggest overnighting in prague if you can. There's also a day trip from Prague to see this cathedral decorated with human bones if that's your thing. \n\n\nAll the flights are relatively cheap when i did a quick search. I put Copenhagen in brackets and at the near-end because I think it's the one to cut in case you decide to spend more time elsewhere. With regards to London, i wouldn't consider any airport besides Heathrow or Gatwick. There were probably monetary reasons to keep doubling back to berlin but I think you lose a lot of time and energy by doing that.\n\n\nFor the second time in berlin, i would suggest being there for the entire weekend for the nightlife before going home.\n\n\nI know you like nature but you won't get too much of it on this trip. That's ok! It's better to have a separate nature centric trip in the future than cram too much in one trip.",

And though there are some sketchy pockets, you\u2019re honestly mostly good to go. Maybe don\u2019t walk alone through the depths of Central Park at like midnight. Also, pay attention on the subway platforms. Don\u2019t blindly hover at the edge of the track while being oblivious. \n\nOtherwise, you\u2019re really fine. And most places visitors end up\u2014whether the tourist traps like Times Square, or the actually fun places like the village, LES, etc\u2014are lively and full of people till all hours, so you\u2019re rarely alone. \n\nThen there are areas in Brooklyn and the Bronx to avoid, but most tourists wouldn\u2019t even be aware of them until enough to go there. And you\u2019d really need the subway to get there, so slim chance you\u2019d accidentally walk there on a ramble. \n\nIt may have a bad rap at times, but NYC is pretty safe actually. Especially cus so many people are out and about till absurd hours even on like Tuesday nights.",

Between Flushing and Jamaica is fine, including Flushing Meadows. Also Rockaway beach is good. In Brooklyn, the whole downtown area near the bridge to Prospect Park is good to go, same with any area near one of the bridges from Manhattan.

That said, at night is a different story and there are plenty of places where I\u2019d feel a little more nervous. Still, you will probably be fine even at night, but I personally don\u2019t see a reason to live like that when on vacation.\n\nHarlem: it\u2019s a mix. There are nice parts of course, especially up on the Hudson River. Then there\u2019s some sketchier parts. I was surprised at how rough the scene is near the 125th St stop on the 4/5/6 train. It\u2019s just a less wealthy neighborhood overall\u2026more barricaded windows, more bail bond shops, more check cashing stores, etc etc. Nothing wrong with those things, but hopefully that paints a picture.\n\nThe Bronx: I haven\u2019t spent that much time up there, but to me it felt like an extension of Harlem. There are some nice parts, but overall it\u2019s simply not as wealthy as the lower part of Manhattan or the nearby parts of Brooklyn and Queens. I can\u2019t really see the appeal of going there as a tourist (outside of baseball / the zoo). Maybe go up there for a really good Italian sandwich at lunch? Leave before dinner? Idk.\n\nA rough rule of thumb is that the wealthiest part of NYC is the stretch from Downtown to Midtown in Manhattan. That\u2019s where the entire Metro system funnels into. The closer you are to that epicenter, the nicer your neighborhood. The farther out, odds are, it\u2019s less nice. But this is just a rough rule of thumb, and there are exceptions (Flushing Queens is cool, Brighton Beach in Brooklyn is cool, etc). You\u2019re safe in the epicenter, and outside of that, just make sure you\u2019ve done some research if you\u2019re going to be there at night.",

But I also urge \u201cchasing white rabbits\u201d, a la Alice in Wonderland. For instance, I found a flyer on a bench on mass transit for a Wychwood/Hobgoblin pub in Tokyo in a neighborhood that I had not planned to visit. On a whim, I dropped whatever plans I had and switched trains to that neighborhood, but I never found that pub. I found a great neighborhood (Akasaka) that I wandered around until I turned a corner and saw a complete London pub that had been dismantled and reassembled and inserted into the first floor of a high rise in Tokyo. It was opening night, and I had a blast. I then joined a group of new friends that I had met at the pub and wandered over to Roppongi until the wee hours.\n\nIMHO the key to both strategic wandering and chasing white rabbits is letting the Greek deity Serendipity be your guide, and she has been very rewarding to me over the years.",

I also went to a little outside bar she recommended (Al Chioschetto) right on the lagoon to enjoy a spritz and watch the sunset and it was amazing. (Also I hate aperol spritz but Venice has a select spritz that I really enjoyed!). Otherwise I was just kinda meandering through the streets and taking photos and going into random shops that caught my attention :) \nAnother food spot I recommend and went to twice lol is Antico Gatoleto. And if you wanna grab a drink at st mark\u2019s square everything is super expensive right there but Ai Do Leoni is a little off to the side and is a much more reasonable price.",

But this is because I met a few people on my first trip there (3 days) through a hobby of mine, and got adopted into their extended friend group on a subsequent trip to visit them which was an incredible experience since they all helped me grow into the person I am today (I was 19 and they were all mid 20s at the time, that was 8 years ago!)\n\nYour mileage may vary but for just a casual visit to Helsinki I think 3-4 days would suffice. It\u2019s a very chill city just to be in and it\u2019s probably my favourite city in the world (that I\u2019ve been to so far), but I still have to go in the winter (my plans to visit during the winter were derailed, so I\u2019ve only experienced spring autumn and summer) \n\nI can think of many more exciting places but the pace of life in Helsinki is just right for me and Finns, while stereotypically Nordic in the sense that they are rather hard to get to know, have been some of the most genuine people in my life after all the experiences we\u2019ve gone through together (we travelled together to a few places) and still check up on me randomly every now and then despite me not having been back there for 5 years. \n\nI\u2019m stoked to be going back there in a few weeks! Albeit only for a little over a week since I work full time now so can\u2019t just gallivant around anywhere I want to since I only have so much annual leave.\n\nHaven\u2019t been to Estonia yet but I\u2019m planning a day trip there this time with some of the boys and I heard many good things about it. Finns love to complain it\u2019s not as cheap as it used to be though haha.\n\nWhat kind of experiences are you looking for? I don\u2019t know Helsinki like the back of my hand but I know it okay I would think and maybe I can suggest some things.",

It's guaranteed to be safe and provide a known-quantity for a traveling experience, but it's also not so much that it forces you to be more concerned about your schedule and logistics than what you're actually experiencing.  If you've done that one thing every day, you won't feel like your trip was wasted, but it'll give you a chance to get a little more firsthand knowledge of the area, talk with safer locals, travelers, tour guides, etc, and because you felt like you did something, you won't feel pressured to take unnecessary risk.  It always helps if you've done research before you ask someone for advice though, so maybe ask what the safest way to get to XXX Basilica is, rather than some vague question like \"what should I do for the rest of the day?\"",

Venice has some must-see items like the Rialto Bridge and Doge Palace. But also has some other fun places to wander around. I actually didn't like the touristy part of Venice as much, and for wandering i preferred the NW corner of the city (the old jewish quarter). There was an outdoor bar nearby where you could hang out and have drinks and tapas. And Venice has the most gorgeous supermarket i've ever been in, the Teatro Italia, which is a converted movie theater. I would also rec taking a boat ride to Murano and burano (which specialize in lace and glass making, tho i cant remember which is which). If you get tired of walking, you can take their public transport, which is boats going all over the island as well as to Murano/Burano. Nicest public transport in the world imo. And i think you can get a day pass for cheap.",

While things have improved reasonably in many parts of India when it comes to gender based violence, a foreign woman will still likely attract a lot of unwanted attention (even foreign men do, to be fair) from peope who are just generally curious. Its easy for bad faith actors to mix themselves into the commotion. If you do visit the region, then Mumbai, southern India, the higher Himalaya, and Sri Lanka are the less bothersome places to be. In upmarket parts of all big cities, however, you would feel the same as you would in any other big city of the world.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, I'd say Singapore is probably the most worry-free city you could explore as a single female traveller. It has it's detractors, yes, but the city honestly has plenty of quirky corners and culture to explore, and it is one of the safest places on the planet.  The silk road cities of Uzbekistan (Khiva, Bukhara, and Samarkand) aren't as modern as Singapore, but they do have lovely old centres which are custom made for walking aimlessly. Further, their being in a formerly Soviet and currently Police state means that single women are a common sight everywhere and security is tight.",

But I didn't have to and didn't want to, I did what I was actually comfortable with and that's what made it very fun. \n\nThe place also definitely makes a difference, sometimes it's nothing objective but rather just a feeling you get. I felt good about Stockholm overall from the first moment, I actually wanted to go right then and there and see everything and I felt I'd be fine. I get the same feeling in many towns in Germany, a bit less in Norway, but never in Spain for example, Spain makes me much more self conscious and careful :p So I'd say don't force it, if you feel like doing it then do it, don't if you don't.",

I stopped at murano and burano. \n\nBut as for other cities, I usually picked a popular attraction or two, then explored around that neighborhood after checking out the sights. If I didn't feel comfy, I'd just retrace my steps back to the popular area or back to the hostel and reset. If I did, I'd spend the day getting lost! \n\nAs a solo lady, I honestly felt very comfortable in Europe during the day. I usually only went out at night in areas I checked out during the day or with new friends.",

Tokyo is an incredibly safe city, and I'd say most if not all places in Tokyo you can just go get lost any time of day and you'll be fine. It can get a little annoying when it comes to catcalling and guys following you between like midnight and 5 am, but even when this happens they usually aren't too aggressive and if you ignore them they'll leave you alone. If that doesn't work then just yell some expletives in English and they'll prolly get freaked out and leave you alone.\n\nMy favorite cities to get lost in, other than Tokyo, have been Nagano, Washington, D.C. (this one can get dicey though especially at night), and Salzburg.",

I just spent two days there, and you'll go crazy trying to follow some itinerary in this maze of narrow, always curving streets and canals. Just wander around in the general direction you want to go (an analog compass is handy), experience serendipity, and then find your way back on foot or on the vaporettos (aquatic buses), that go everywhere. The tourist crowds are so thick, the only thing you have watch out for is pickpockets -- they swarm, they don't look like pickpockets, and they're very good (my phone pickpocketed on the metro in Rome)\n\nBut you don't want to just wander around and get lost in Guadalajara.

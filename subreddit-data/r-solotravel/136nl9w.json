    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI am going on my first solo trip to Spain and Portugal in a few weeks and am incredibly excited! However, I am wondering what the best way to get pictures of myself would be. I plan on asking others when I can, but I also want another option just in case (I'm v shy!). I've seen some people on this sub mention GorillaPods, but I just want to get more opinions. If you have a GorillaPod, do you recommend it? What do you like/dislike about it? \n\nThanks!",

It\u2019s designed to wrap around something and often times there aren\u2019t anything to anchor it or it\u2019s too clumsy to use.\n\nIf I wanted photos of myself, I just ask people who I\u2019m with (when staying at a hostel), or ask strangers around, which there are plenty of at popular areas.",

It can be good for uneven ground but I\u2019d consider the kind of places you go, the kind of photos you want to take, and how exactly you would use it. I rarely use it now because it\u2019s too short to be worthwhile sitting it on the ground, and too awkward to sit anywhere else so I just feel like it takes too much time to bother with.",

The time it takes to set up your camera or phone on a pod makes it less than convenient, and they often don't have anything to grip or rest on. Also, in crowded places, you probably don't want to set up your camera or phone at a distance where it could easily be swiped or stolen by someone running past. \n\nUsually if I want myself in a photo, I'll either ask a nice passer-by, or just hold my arm out and snap one selfie-style.",

            "comment": "It depends on how big your camera is I suppose. \n\nGorillapods wear out fairly quickly and I don't find them any easier to pack than any other tripod of similar dimensions.\n\nI generally travel with Olympus and don't often find myself missing a tripod due to the IBIS (easy 1+ second hand held shots). I usually still bring something small in case I want some astro or longer exposure shots. The three that I use the most are the Manfrotto Pixi, Platypod and Ultrpod. The last two have the ability to be strapped to something similar to the Gorillapod but pack better and the Platypod specifically is much more secure when strapped down.\n\nFor everything else, I'll use a carbon fiber tripod that packs down to about the same size as the larger Gorillapod.\n\nI don't really do selfies though, but I wouldn't have an issue using any of the above with a timer/remote/app.",

It's small and good for balancing a camera on rough terrain like rocks. Even so, it still can be difficult to get the camera level.",

I\u2019m also pretty shy at first in social situations but I\u2019ve been travelling South East Asia for over 4 months now and found that most people are happy to oblige and take a photo of you, and that after the first few times of finding it a bit awkward, I find it pretty easy now!",

    "postText": "Super excited for my first trip to the US this July (I'm just about to graduate uni in the UK) - would this be a sensible intinerary/plan? I'm planning on travelling by Amtrak train so if anyone has any tips with this service, that would be great!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoston: July 3rd - July 6th (three-ish full days as arriving early morning)\n\nNew York: July 6rd - July 11th (four full days)\n\nPhiladelphia: July 11rd - July 14th (two full days)\n\nWashington D.C.: July 14rd - July 17th (three full days as flying late in the evening)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have already booked my flights so I know that I will be there for the two weeks, so am just wondering if this time split makes sense (not too much or too little in any particular place)? Or if there are any other destinations I should consider for a day or two?\n\nI know that I will be in Boston for 4th July so if anyone has any recommendations on what to do that day/evening that would be wonderful!\n\nI'm into sports (mainly NFL which I know is in the offseaon) - would it be feasible price-wise to get tickets to any events while I'm there?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother other interesting suggestions of things to do would be much appreciated too!

Like the Met and the 9/11 museum if those are things that interest you- both are incredible. Skip going to the Statue of Liberty and top of Empire State Building unless you really want to. Go to the top of the Rockefeller at sunset instead of the Empire State Building! Ask locals about food places to try in every city- use yelp if you have to but asking locals is fun!",

About the Same size as Oklahoma City, El Paso Texas/Baltimore and it\u2019s smaller by over 100K than Indianapolis, Columbus Ohio etc. If you come to DC expecting it to be NYC, Chicago, LA, SF, Philly etc then you haven\u2019t done your research. Those places are 3X+ larger than DC. \n\nDC has some of the most unique architecture in the country (you have to go to the neighborhoods and not just downtown/monuments). Is arguably the most walkable city in all of USA and has a \u201cEuropean\u201d feel to it - designed by a French man. World class free museums, great park system with waterfalls/rock scrambling/great hiking in the middle of the city. Has some of the best cuisine from all around the world due to lots of foreign people living here. Embassies from over 100 countries are here to see/can go to events inside them and enjoy their culture and food. \n\nLots of history from revolution, civil war, WWI/WWII etc. Civil rights history is everywhere. It\u2019s the capital of the most advanced nation on the planet. It\u2019s far from \u201cboring\u201d if you come and see the monuments and a couple museums then leave then yes it\u2019s \u201cboring\u201d\n\nIt has a great variety of neighborhoods. From some of the most expensive neighborhoods in the country in upper NW to Hispanic dominated neighborhoods selling native foods from their countries to African American neighborhoods grilling on the sidewalk with a slow pace of life to fast paced brand new buildings on the waterfront dominated by white individuals. Extremely liberal and young population. Consistently ranks as one of the best places to live in the country with one of the most educated and open populations.",

All four cities also have a ton of concert venues, so if you\u2019re looking to fill a few hours in the evening, highly recommend. It\u2019s also going to be very hot in NYC, Philly, and DC, so be prepared to walk a lot in heat (appropriate clothing, stay hydrated, sunscreen, etc). Overall, there are plenty of walking tours, but have never done one in NYC (I tend to pick an area and poke around, then hop the subway to another rinse repeat).\n\nSpecific recommendations\n\nBoston- MassTransit is famously unreliable, be prepared for delays. Boston proper is beautiful, walkable, with Cambridge just a hop away. Take the bus for a day trip to Salem and do some of the tours, House of the Seven Gables is fascinating. \n\nNYC- a boat tour around Manhattan. It\u2019s a great way to get a unique view of the city, the skyline, and it\u2019s cooler on the water. I love the kitsch of it so would also recommend Coney Island, and Central Park has hidden gems throughout. Don\u2019t be afraid to use the subway, it really isn\u2019t that bad. Avoid Times Square unless you\u2019re going to the discount ticket booth, it\u2019s the ultimate disappointing capitalist tourist trap. Do walk the High Line, starting or ending near the Chelsea Food Market. Do not be afraid of the food carts, they\u2019ll often have the best prices and keep you fed and happy on a budget.\n\nPhilly- the art museum, M\u00fctter museum, historical tours. Say yes to food (brunch at Green Eggs- two thumbs up!), but no to walking everywhere - Uber or Lyft will be your best friend to get from area to area. The Magic Gardens on South St is beautiful and unique. Check out Fishtown, Reading Terminal Market, avoid Pat\u2019s and Gino\u2019s like the tourist traps they are (unless you\u2019re drunk, in which case pick your side and enjoy) but when you do get a cheesesteak get it wit whiz.\n\nDC- most of the Smithsonian museums are free, and walking distance from each other. The National Mall (monuments, not shopping) is a great way to spend a morning or afternoon, and is also walking distance from many of the museums. The humidity in July here can be oppressive, arguably worse than any of the other cities, so make sure you\u2019re keeping tabs on how you feel.\n\n(Edited for formatting)",

For NYC, I recommend doing the following one morning, which i did about 10 years ago on my first visit:\n\nStart at Brooklyn Bridge Park, around the Granite Prospect, for great views of Manhattan across the river. Then, walk over Brooklyn Bridge. You'll end up near City Hall, so you can check that out before heading over to the 911 memorial. Then head back over to Broadway and walk down to Wall Street, then continue on to Battry Park, where you can see the Statue of Liberty across the water (and even take a boat trip out there if you want). That covers quite a few of the major landmarks in Lower Manhattan, but it is a lot of walking, so it will depend on your own abilities.\n\nThe Empire State building is worth visiting, but IMHO the best views are from Top of the Rock.\n\nBudget a whole day for Central Park, or split it up over a couple days. I did one of the art galleries in the morning,  then walked across the park, taking in Belvedere Castle and couple of nearby sights, to the Natural History Museum.\n\nIf you support any sports teams in England that are playing while you're in America, look up local supporters groups to see where they watch the games.\n\nHope you have a great trip!",

I'd agree with others though and remove the time from Phi. and slot into NY.  Be aware that the time you're going is also peak travel season for everyone in the world, many touristy places will be crowded and the humidity all along the east coast will be at its highest.  As an American who lives on the west coast, even 5 days is a brief trip to NY and I go every 3-4 yrs.  NYC also has one of the most extensive subway networks like the tube so getting around will be much more convenient than say DC - something to consider when you are spending time in each city in how accessible sites/events are for you by foot.",

You'll find certain parts of it like Beacon Hill resemble Chelsea, London ;) If you're into revolutionary war history, you can follow the Freedom Trail (marked by a brick line in the road). Wander the Old North End for some Italian-American food and culture, go to Quincy Market for lunch. \n\nI recommend taking the Lucky Star bus from Boston to NYC. Very cheap and pretty comfy. Takes you to Chinatown right at the end of the Manhattan Bridge.",

When you get to Staten Island, just take the ferry right back again. You get amazing views of the Manhattan skyline. Great photo OPs.",

            "comment": "I love NYC and go down there usually once a year.\n\n* Skip the taxis. NYC is very walkable and easy to navigate, and the subway system gets you basically everywhere\n* Spend a day around the southern tip of Manhattan. Chinatown is there, trinity church, wall street, battery park. Take the free statten island ferry, it goes right past the statue of liberty and gives you a lovely view. Usually I just turn around and ride it back.\n* Greenwich village was another of my favourite days in NYC - we walked the Highline park back.\n* The Met is my favourite museum in NYC (and one of my favourite in the world) but ymmv depending on what you enjoy.\n* Central park is iconic and lovely - take your time with it. The park is so big that the experience of the park really changes depending on where you are.\n* Our plan for our next trip includes going up to Washington Heights and walking back down to the theatre district, I'm excited to see a new part of the city.\n* I've never done rockerfeller centre or the empire state building, I find them expensive and overhyped, but if you're excited about them I think you should. \n\nWhere to stay?\n\nAnywhere as long as it has good subway access, on as high a floor as you can. The traffic noise in Manhattan is... a lot. And going mid range vs cheap won't do much to help (can't speak to luxury accommodations). I don't have a go-to for NYC, as I find I get the best deals by searching around each time. NYC is expensive, but pricing varies a lot and there are good deals to be had.\n\nPod 51 is a little out of the way (read: quieter) and boasts solo hostel rooms, but I generally find it's more expensive than comparable and I've only ended up there once. Also had a great experience with the Jazz on Columbus Circle hostel. No frills but got the job done at a good price. \n\nSafety:\n\nI've always felt safe as a woman traveling in NYC, even alone. It's busy enough that there's always many people around. NYCers are perfectly friendly and helpful as long as you understand how politeness works there. Basically: it's a big, dense city and we're all stuck together whether you like it or not. Don't waste people's time. Polite is not making small talk with the barista, it's ordering quickly so she can move on to the next person. If you pause in the sidewalk, make sure you're not blocking foot traffic. \n\nOther stuff to do:\n\nReally NYC is so insanely big and dense and busy there is something incredible for every niche interest. Don't be afraid to google \"\\[niche interest\\] NYC\", you may find a whole museum for that specific thing or an incredible specialty store. \n\nBroadway in NYC:\n\nSo broadway is my thing, why I'm in NYC a lot. In terms of recommendations for first timers who know nothing about broadway, here's some recommendations. All of these are great quality shows, good value for money, and offer what I consider to be a real 'broadway' experience.\n\n\\- \"I want to see a classic broadway show and have a good time without breaking the bank\" Some Like It Hot\n\n\\- \"I want a comedy but maybe not so classic? OR I think south park is hilarious\" Book of Mormon\n\n\\- \"I want to see incredible stagecraft and I'm not afraid of sad stories\" Hadestown\n\n\\- \"I like all those things! Some stagecraft, some humour, some sadness. What's the best all around crowd pleaser for a first timer?\" Wicked (note: not expensive but you won't get a deal either)\n\n\\- \"I am willing to work a bit to keep up, have a lot of money and appreciate high quality theatre\" Hamilton\n\n\"I have a lot of money and want to see a high quality classic. 'Murder Comedy' sounds interesting and I like clever wordplay.\" Sweeney Todd. (note: don't do lotto/rush for sweeney. The way the stage is set up, the lotto/rush seats are partial view. Not great for your first broadway experience\"\n\n\"I want to recognize the songs/story while still getting that classic broadway show experience and some incredible stagecraft\" - Lion king (note: not expensive but you won't get a deal either)\n\n\"I want to see a play, singing is dumb\" - I see plays a lot less, so I can't help as much. But for a more classic experience I'd be looking at Peter Pan Goes Wrong for a comedy and Leopoldstadt for a drama.\n\n\"I'm broke as shit and can't afford broadway\" - Almost all shows have a lottery and many are pretty easy to win. Enter for any show you're interested in and see what you get. Some shows also have Rush, where you line up outside the theatre for a few hours and get a cheap ticket. Lotto/Rush tickets are usually in the $40-$50 range. The seats should be fine for any show listed here, except Sweeney.\n\nThere is also a TKTS booth in times square that sells discount tickets. This is legit, just don't let them rush you through your purchase (30% off the most expensive seat in the house is not a deal unless you were buying premium anyways). They will likely have some of: Book of Mormon, Some Like It Hot, Hadestown, Peter Pan Goes Wrong, Leopoldstadt. It will never have Wicked, Hamilton, or Sweeney.",

            "comment": "Book your train ASAP.  Amtrak fares are like airfares so they get more expensive the closer you are to travel. \n\nIt's going to be hot as hell, pack like you're going to Spain or some other sunny destination. \n\nI'm in DC so can't speak for the rest of the cities, but we do not have pay with your phone here for the metro.  You'll have to get a SmartTrip card (Oyster Card) and add money to it to get in and out. \n\nDownload Uber, Lyft, and Curb.  Uber and Lyft are available pretty much everywhere.  Curb is available in NYC and DC to request and pay for your taxi.  I think they're doing a pilot in Boston...but not sure. \n\nYou could skip Philly and add an extra day in Boston and an extra day in DC. \n\nThe Embassies are always doing open houses and other fun things.  The French Embassy always does something for Bastille Day. \n\nIt's baseball season, so maybe try and go to a baseball game if anyone is playing at home.  In DC I know the Orioles are home, not sure about the Nats\n\nDo you have specific things you like to do when you travel? Food, museums, tours, etc?",

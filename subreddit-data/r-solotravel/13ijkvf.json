    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nFigured I'd write down my thoughts on a few days I spent in Madeira this May (2023).\n\n**Accommodation**: I was deciding for quite a while what to go for. Hotels seemed a bit too expensive and impersonal. I don't yet feel like going for hostels and everyone seems to have a bad experience with Airbnb (plus it's not that good for the local housing market). Went with a serviced apartment through Booking. Paid about 100 Euros a night and it was located in Funchal near La Vie. I can highly recommend that as a base for your first trip to Madeira solo. Quite close to La Vie with a big grocery store there, as well as some options for fast food if you feel tired and don't want to go downtown to eat out. It's conveniently close to the SAM main bus stop (think it's called Edificio 2000) so you can hop on loads of buses in the Funchal/Eastern Madeira area.\n\n**Food, Drink, Experiences**: Before I set off I only had plans to see one restaurant as I saw someone on Instagram go to it and I wanted to try out what they had (limpets). It was a decent experience but for me almost all restaurants in Funchal seemed very identical. Waiters standing outside, lots of pictures of food on menus and a similar ambiance. Of course if you went off the Michelin Guide I'm sure you'd find places which would feel more premium/special, but I didn't find a lot of \"local gems\", bar one I place visited on my last day. \n\nThat was Bela 5 Snack Bar, near Zona Velha. The atmosphere was great, it seemed like a tiny tucked-away spot, but the food was really really good, I felt really welcome and other reviews seem to think likewise. I wish I went there a few more times as the meals they had were relatively cheap (8-12 EUR), they had good cheep beer and as I mentioned the food was delicious. Definitely a place I'll go back to. In my hikes I went to a few spots, such as Snack Bar Faisca, Restaurant Portela a Vista and the cafe at Achado do Teixeira. All were great and are definitely good places to stop by.\n\nIn terms of drinking and night life, Funchal definitely seemed on the calmer end. I didn't see that many groups of party goers around and I was downtown pretty much every single night as what I saw I really liked. I liked the area around the Flower Market at Av. Arriaga, with plenty of poncha stands opened up until quite late. Barreirinha Bar &amp; Cafe was also a good spot, with plenty of people there drinking poncha/beers and enjoying life. \n\nA word on poncha, it's strong. Enjoyable but strong so take it easy. It's quite sweet so it doesn't feel like you're drinking a lot of alcohol, but in every one I think there's about 40-50ml of 50% rum so it is definitely quite a bit of alcohol.\n\nIn terms of social memories/experiences, I met up with this girl who was on Erasmus there, and a few times we went to the beach at 21 R. do Lazareto in Funchal (you can find it on Google Maps as \"Path to Praia do Toco\"). The walk down and through the rocks is a bit sketchy, but it was really peaceful, a good place to chill with a beer, read a book and try and gather some limpets. Although if you see really small ones leave them alone to let them grow and try to gather only the bigger ones. You can eat them raw or cook them in a bit of olive oil with some garlic, served with lemon juice and crusty bread. (I didn't feel like swimming there as the waves were really quite strong and the rocks seemed very jagged. If I had swimming shoes with a good grip I'd give it a go, as my main worry was decking it whilst getting in/out of the water on the rocks.)\n\nI didn't go to Madeira particularly to meet a lot of people and do a ton of social activities, but those evenings at the beach were certainly a highlight and I made some great memories there :) . Everyone else young I spoke with, either at the aforementioned bars or on hikes I went to spoke very good English and was down to get to know each other a bit.\n\n**Hikes:** I will talk about transport here too. Can you spend a week in Madeira without renting a car/scooter or going on tours? Yes. I managed to do 4 big-ish hikes in 5 days, 3 by bus and one using a transfer company. I did the Levada dos Tornos, Levada do Furado + Vereda dos Balcoes, Pico Arieiro to Pico Ruivo and Vereda Da Ponta De S\u00e3o Lourenco. All were great, very different, all moderately tiring. I wouldn't go on them without at least some fitness or you won't have a good time. Every time the trail goes up or down it's through very steep stairs so it's taxing going both up and down them. I'd start all of them with a lot of water and some snacks, decent shoes and for the Levadas and Pico Arieiro a decent flashlight. I used Pico Transfers for the Picos and I can wholeheartedly recommend them (the sunrise hike, but there were a ton of people at the top there so it got a bit crowded). In terms of other hikes, there are plenty of blogs around if you search \"Madeira hikes by public transport\"/\"Hikes in madeira you can do without a car\". Those had up-to date info on how to get around. For navigation on the hikes, AllTrails/Gaia GPS worked well. Oh, and definitely pack a powerbank with you too and plenty of sunscreen!\n\n**Overall:** It was a great first introduction to solo travel. I both want to do it again and I'd also like to see Madeira again. Funchal would be where I'd base myself, but I'd rent a car probably to see some places in the Northern or Western part of the island. The people were great, the food was too and it wasn't too expensive. \n\nPS: Prepare yourself for some stress arriving/departing as sometimes the winds can get quite strong around the airport and flights might get cancelled, so give yourself a day or two of a buffer for your arrival back/any connections/important things you can't miss.\n\nIf you've got any questions for me feel free to ask!",

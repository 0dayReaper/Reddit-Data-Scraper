    "postText": "Hi! I hope you are well. I'm planning a solo trip mid July to Kefalonia.\n\nI am a student and budget is low. I found a very good quality price room at Poros but I am concerned about the bus services. I know that Kytle bus takes me there from the airport stopping in Argostili. But I don't know if I am secluding myself too much with this option in a cultural activities sense.\n\nI am not looking to do nothing in particular just than relax at the beach but would no mind to get to know the \"essence\", history, and highlights of the island. Do you think this is still possible by staying at Poros without a car?\n\nThank you very much!",

    "postText": "How do you deal with vibe checks in Germany as a solo traveller? Clubbing in Germany is never a casual affair and it\u2019s starting to become annoying how often the zoomer at the door tells me \u201cno\u201d. It often goes something like:\n\n\u201cDid you come by yourself?\u201d  \n\u201cYes\u201d  \n\u201cWhy?\u201d  \n\u201cI\u2019m just visiting/I don\u2019t live here\u201d  \n\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d  \n\u201cA guy suggested it to me/to dance/was the best option for tonight\u201d\n\nThen I get shown the exit. I\u2019m starting to wonder if I should start saying my friends are inside because it seems impossible to have a good night out by yourself. Any similar experiences?",

The clubs have some key strikes: not looking the part (ie casual black street wear), not speaking German, not knowing who is playing, being a single  straight male, I\u2019m sure there are others I can\u2019t think of right now. Some clubs are more permissive than others some require you to tick all the boxes. The key for maximizing your chance if you can\u2019t to all of them is do what you can. So being able to say oh man I love this DJ and know something about their songs is so helpful if you can\u2019t speak German.",

                    "comment": "This completely misses the point. One should know who is playing inside because the sound of that dj resonates with you, then you probably have something in common with others inside or at least will enjoy yourself dancing your ass off. The point is not to \u201cget in\u201d but be in the right place on a given night for you. So, go to RA, see what djs are in the clubs, listen to them on SoundCloud,if you hear one and think \u201cI love this music!\u201d then go there where they are dj\u2019ing. At the door you will know who\u2019s playing for the right reason for you, the bouncer whose job is to keep out people trying to \u201cget in\u201d, and those who are inside enjoying the music.",

This is literally what I do in my home city as well and other cities when I'm traveling.\n\nThe only exception I know of is Berghain, and honestly even that is mostly not their own fault but because the whole world heard about piss and sex parties in the berghain and storm it during tourist season while not giving a fuck about good techno music.",

That's literally all lol. I'm not German and when I went to Berlin I got into Tresor and Watergate on my own no issue. Watergate asked me some questions and I just said I was there to see DJ x play.

One bouncer made me undo my jacket (which was all I was wearing on top) but still let me in without problems. \n\nI also went with a big group for my first night that I'd met at the hostel. Big mix of genders and ethnicities so that helped us all get in I believe, so maybe try pairing up with people you meet on the night. \n\nI didn't even try for Berghain. The only night I didn't get in anywhere was when I was with three other dudes and we were all quite obviously drunk. In hindsight, it was absolutely fair enough. \n\nI'd say dressing the part is the most important thing if you're on your own. If you're there on a weekend then maybe look up the show before you go but I wasn't asked once on my nights there, but none of them were on the weekend. \n\nHappy clubbing! I found Berlin at least to be one of the best cities I've clubbed in. I think it cultivates a unique atmosphere with the no-phones policy as everyone I met was super friendly. Maybe the being mostly naked part had a lot to do with it \ud83d\udc40",

I dressed as I usually do, but did some fun make up. I\u2018d recommend being friendly and smiling a little bit, as most people there feel like they\u2018re too cool for it. There are good and bad times to go. I\u2018ve had the most success going at 11pm or 3 am (or anytime when there aren\u2018t a mot of people waiting). Honestly I just check the line and if it\u2018s not long just try my luck. For me no club is worth waiting 30+ mins for, and if you get rejected then at least you\u2018ve not wasted your time. \n\nAll this being said though, as long as you don\u2018t look like you live techno, then you\u2018re not getting in. I\u2018m talking about piercings, make up, clothes, jewellery, painted nails and shoes. Obviously it\u2018s a double standard for them to say you should come as you are and then dress code you, but they want a specific vibe in their clubs and pick the people accordingly. No one in Berlin wants a club full of straight white men in air force ones.\n\n\nEdit: as others have suggested, check what the theme is and/or who is DJing",

And you don\u2019t need to go with girls to get in, that\u2019s not how things work here.\n\nYou can be totally honest with the bouncer and say you haven\u2019t been there before, but also show them you know what the party is. It\u2019s not hard, takes 10 min of research and you can decide if it\u2019s your vibe. \n\nOnce you attend parties that are selective about letting people in, you really appreciate them and can see why. I also understand this comes with problems - unconscious bias or racism can come into play, so it\u2019s not without some problems for sure. \n\nPeople also have the impression it isn\u2019t tourist friendly and that\u2019s generally also not true. If you\u2019re being a tourist (ie. You\u2019re going to Kitkat to stare and gawk at what people are doing) then you\u2019re not the person who should be going, if you\u2019re a tourist who genuinely wants to enjoy the scene, the music, the people, then you\u2019re welcomed.\n\nThere are also many places where you can have a good time and the door is easy (watergate, ritterbutzke, Else).",

Went to Berlin solo last year and got in to everywhere except Sisyphos (didn\u2019t even bother trying with Berghain). My responses were similar to yours. I remember the guy in front of me at the first club I was in line for said the same shit, but he was wearing a bright flannel and blue jeans. Doesn\u2019t matter what he said he was never gonna be let in. Like a 2 minute google search would have told you what to wear. Another tip is to make friends in line (especially if they are locals or Germans in general). I befriended a group of Germans in line and when it came time for the vibe check they did all talking (no idea what was actually said since it was in German lol). Also maybe try meeting a girl at your hostel or find a group (that\u2019s about at least 50% girls)",

There are clubs in Berlin where you get in without problems, like Club Soda in Kulturbrauerei for example. They are also full of underaged boys trying to start shit, pick-up artists, and bad vibes in general. Same for Matrix basically. That's just the trade-off for not having strict bouncers.",

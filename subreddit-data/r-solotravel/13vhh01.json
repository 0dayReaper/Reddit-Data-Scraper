I'm planning to go to:\n\nJapan (1 month: Late Jul \u2014\u00a0Late Aug)  \nThailand (2 weeks: Late Aug \u2014\u00a0Early Sep)  \nBali (3 weeks: Early \u2014\u00a0End of Sep)  \nKorea (1 month: October)  \nAustralia ??\n\nI'm potentially going to stay in Korea for 2 months instead of 1 because the rent is so much cheaper there, although I would love to stay in Australia for longer if I go.\n\nI'm going mostly because I want a break from my life and I want to centre myself/rediscover/build myself from this experience.\n\nI dance as a serious hobby and I take about 10 classes a week right now in Canada so I'm planning on dancing in Japan and Korea for sure and living like a citizen, but I don't know if that's a waste of time to just go there and not explore the country. What is your advice on doing the tourist thing but not burning out but also being able to live like a normal person that's not always on the go?\n\nI'll also be staying at mostly hotels and AirBnbs so any tips on making friends in a foreign place where they may not speak English would also be awesome :)\n\nAny other advice and insight would also be greatly appreciated! Thanks!!",

My advice is first get accomodation for 1 or 2 weeks see if you want to stay longer in the city first. If you feel like you want to then go ahead and rent an apartment for a month or more, many westeners do that in tokyo and seoul and it can be an interesting way to travel. But yeah learning some of the language would be a must then",

You\u2019ll be at airbnb and killing time by yourself trying to interact with people who only know broken English and are just  trying to live their lives. All the while you are taking a long vacation and masquerading as a local.\n\nJust take the gift of time that you have and may never get again and extensively explore SE Asia.\n\nDrop the delusion of finding yourself and living like a local.\n\nThink about where you live right now. Imagine a Japanese person coming in with 0 to no English skills and living right next to you for 6 months. They have no real purpose but telling you they are trying to live like a local and find themselves\u2026pretty ridiculous right? Because it is.",

I know someone that lives for months in an area, she works online and I would personally get bored being in the same spot for that long.  There's no right or wrong way.  I will say you're not going to experience what it's like to be a local in only a month or two, unless you did some sort of home stay.  \n\nI recommend giving yourself some flexibility and not locking yourself into a place long term. Also where are you going in these places, that's going to factor into your experiences.  1-2 months in Seoul or Busan is going to be different than that period in a smaller town (though Korea is pretty small so you can get anywhere in a few hours), same with Japan &amp; Thailand. In Bali about 1 night in Denpasar was enough for me never to want to spend any more time there then I have to, but Ubud touristy as it is, I could spend a month there and going around the island on a scooter.   \n\nIn the end don't put too much pressure or too many expectations on yourself, just enjoy the experience.",

Part of the reason why it interests me though is the dance community and I would like to spend more than just a month taking their classes but I guess I'll discover how much that matters to me vs exploring other countries",

Most people befriend other people that speak their primary language and have a similar culture. In your case you'd probably just end up befriending other longterm travelers.\n\nAlso 2 months in korea is an insane amount of time, i spent 2 weeks there and felt that was a little too long.\n \nAs for other thoughts, I think going into this to \"rediscover yourself\" is asking a lot. Most people don't come out of trips a changed person. \n\nPersonally, if i were to take 6 months off, I'd travel and explore as much as possible. This will end up being more expensive, but id substitute time out from more expensive countries and spend more time in cheaper countries.\n\nSomething like \n3 weeks japan\n2 weeks korea\n3~4 weeks Indonesia (not just bali)\n3~4 weeks Thailand\n3~4 weeks vietnam\nthen add Cambodia, laos, Malaysia, or whatever you fancy",

Although I think October is perfect for South Korea.\n\nI'm not sure how easy it will be to actually connect with people, so ask your friends if they have connections in each place you're planning to go, and hopefully through your hobby you'll find like-minded English speakers.\n\nI did a similar thing a couple years ago, spent one month in another city abroad just to be somewhere else a little bit, I found it allowed to still see some of the locals sights but on a more laid-back rhythm and allowed you to find local habits (i.e. find coffee shops restaurants parks gyms that you often go to). I had friends visit me which was amazing and met some local mutual friends. Would definitely do it again esp if you are working remotely or focusing on hobby/training.",

Still doing the touristy things but on a laid-back rhythm instead of feeling like I HAVE to be on the move every day and being able to relax and enjoy the coffee/shops and restaurants.

She was really inspiring because when I met her in a hostel, she said she lived there for a few months trying to find gigs in the entertainment industry. I was a photographer so I helped her take portrait shots for her hoping she would make it. \n\nOver time after following her on social media, she collabed with known YouTubers, and talk shows, and even ended up being an extra in countless K-dramas. I messaged her few years ago to express how happy I was to see all that and she expressed to me how thankful she was that I pretty much helped her start her career in Seoul. \n\nIf you're just seeing where life is taking you, hope you find what you're looking for",

It allows you to have more time to sort of relax and actually enjoy your vacation and not feel like you\u2019re on some sort of field trip the whole time. If you\u2019re having an off day, you can just sort of chill out/do nothing and not feel like you\u2019re wasting time. The thing I do is just make a list of all the things I want to do and see, but I don\u2019t really create a schedule for myself or any kind of itineraries. I just go sightseeing when I feel like it. I\u2019ve gone with friends that take shorter trips, and their daily itineraries a really overwhelming to me and make me feel like I can\u2019t actually enjoy the moments because I feel so rushed. \n\nIf you\u2019re in a place for a while you\u2019ll probably also make some local friends or other travelers that will usually offer to show you around as well or have things already planned out and you can just tag along. That\u2019s how you usually get to see things that are off the beaten path and things like would feel more like \u201cliving like a local\u201d. I\u2019ve made friends in Japan that speak really good English to the point where my language proficiency wasn\u2019t an issue. Dance class would probably be a really good place to make friends. I also make friends on Bumble bff- lots of people on there speak really good English. English is the language that\u2019s most commonly taught in schools around the world as a second language so basically anywhere you go in the world you\u2019ll be able to find at least some people that speak really good English. \n\nThe only thing that worries me about your plan is six months. Seems like a really long time to be away from home for someone that hasn\u2019t traveled a lot. How do you know that you\u2019ll like traveling for such a long period of time? Maybe do a month-long trip first to see if you like it?",

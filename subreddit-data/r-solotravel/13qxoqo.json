I think that when people get a vibe of people in a country being cold or unfriendly it's usually just that the culture encourages a greater social distance with strangers or outsiders.\n\nThings like sexism, racism, classism, homophobia, etc and how and to what extent those problems manifest in a society will also vastly change experiences at the individual level.",

We underestimated how bad the road there would be and got stuck in the middle of nowhere in hot climate and the road was steep with no safety railing. \n\nA local guy with a pickup showed up and stopped, we got really happy but then instead of helping us out of this situation he started haggling and wanting money for doing anything, think he demanded 50 euros to help our car up a hill with loose gravel.\n\nWe are from Sweden and often are seen as cold, but I don\u2019t believe many swedes would exploit someone in that sort of situation.",

I once went to Bosnia and I didn't realize that the local busses didn't run as much after a certain hour in this one small town I made during a day trip...I somehow missed the bus too because of a language difference. Some dude working at a shop helped me out and contacted his friend and I paid like $10 for him to drive me back to my hostel. I didn't mind because I needed to get home somehow and he needed the income, I guess. The Balkans, from what I've found, has a pretty huge black market in terms of making money (I saw it everywhere).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt also obviously depends on the person.

God forbid, an Asian person takes one photo that literally every other white person is doing, and you will get harassed and not the white people. I've seen white girls crowding places, changing outfits, wearing freaking thongs in inappropriate areas, doing duckface, and yet they will find the one Asian grandma with their daughter and make fun of them for taking a family photo.

Some of the European tourists that went there treat Asians as if we are pests sometimes. I had a chance to visit in the middle of Covid (when restrictions were stricter) to Cinque Terre so it was mainly filled with European tourists. I went to one of those famous viewpoints and there's a Belgian dude who is hogging the whole space with his camera and tripod. He like rolls his eyes when he sees me. Then he randomly starts talking to this Dutch guy and they are like \"oh it's not so crowded these days here. Maybe it's because there are no Asian tourists.\" and the Belgian guy looks at me and loudly goes, \"ugh, they are everywhere.\" Meanwhile, hogging the space, not letting anyone enjoy the view with his ironically Made in Asia camera taking a million photos.",

I kept hearing Turkish people are SO friendly all the time. She's Jewish and I'm visibly East Asian and the difference in the way we were treated! Basically, the only time she was maybe treated a bit badly was when she mentioned she was Jewish and she basically saw how I would get harassed and get squinty eyes or people making really racist comments at me. One guy asked me how much I was!  She said it was eye opening for her to see that. She got invited over constantly for free tea. One time I was with her and the guy kept asking her if I was her student (because he assumed I was the one who needed to learn English) when she mentioned her job. I'm Asian American and it didn't matter that I spoke perfect English lol. We stayed with her guy friend once in this beach town and I met his brother and his brother literally told me that I would probably not be allowed to enter one of the mosques because they hate Koreans (after I mentioned I was ethnically Korean)....whiich btw, is SO odd because usually Turkish people do warm up to me more once they realize I'm Korean and not Chinese due to their involvement in the Korean war. But yeah, there were Korean tourists who got beat up by a local gang when they visited Istanbul because they were mistaken as being Chinese...whereas, like how many random white people do you know getting beat up these days due to the war in Ukraine? I bet you my ass would have to be more careful if there was a war with China.",

            "comment": "Yes. Especially since \"friendly\" is usually a stand-in for \"accommodating to tourists\" among people who work in the tourism industry and usually have no choice but to be friendly and polite. \n\nFriendliness is an entirely subjective measure; what's polite or rude varies widely by culture. Some cultural communications styles are more direct or abrupt, while others aren't. That doesn't necessarily mean they're your friends; it could just mean that they are communicating in a certain style that is more open or vivacious versus more soft-spoken or reserved. A lot of so-called \"friendly\" behaviour can feel very fake, especially when it's over-the-top and coming from someone in the service industry, e.g. in some parts of the US. Or it can refer to people simply not displaying anger directly. For instance, Thailand is often referred to as the \"land of smiles\" and people comment on how friendly everyone seems, but that's probably due to strong cultural taboos against shouting, raising your voice, or displaying anger in public. I've personally found that some places where people *seem* the friendliest can actually be the hardest for foreigners to break in, because people display different behaviour in public versus in private. Whereas cultures where people are more direct or, as I like to call them, \"no filter\" cultures can *seem* rude, but people are basically saying what they think and thinking what they say so it can be easier to make friends.\n\nThere's also usually a big city versus smaller town divide; almost anywhere you go in the world, people will be more abrupt and less \"friendly\" in big cities. Painting entire countries or cultures with the same brush can really reinforce stereotypes.\n\nIn general, local people have jobs, friends, families, and *lives*. They aren't super interested in making friends with tourists who are just in town for a few days. If you go somewhere expecting to make friends with locals, unless you put in the time and effort over the long term, that's unlikely to happen. Chances are, the people you meet are just being polite. It's much easier to make friends with other travellers than it is with locals, since they're the ones who probably have more in common with you and are there for the same reasons.",

But it's another thing to actually LIVE like them.\n\nMany (westerner) travelers enjoy reliable electricity, running water, and flush toilets at home. Many travelers enjoy the experience of frequent power outages, no running water, and pit toilets while visiting a rural area or jungle for a few days or maybe even weeks. It does however, give us more perspective of \"you don't know what you have until it's gone\" and we better appreciate the \"little things\" we took for granted back home before we ever traveled.\n\nAlso, the mere fact that we CAN travel sets us apart from many locals in developing countries. They often find our way of life as fascinating as we find theirs! \n\nIt's impossible to fully understand the people in any 1 place, even the place you've lived most of your life! BUT we can understand how the people of a place make us feel. Those feelings result in generalizations. It should be implied that there are good and bad people everywhere. \n\nI personally hate adding justifications like \"there are bad people everywhere, but the people here are some of the friendliest!\" But some get hung up on \"not ALL [insert group here]\" that they don't see that a generalization exists to generalize a group, not to list every personality type in existence.",

Not to mention what you perceive as \u201crude\u201d. I live between Europe and the U.S. now, and a big % of my U.S. friends think waiters are rude here for not smiling much or checking up on you all the time, when that\u2019s just a culture difference IMO. Smiling as much and as often as most service people in the U.S. do would make you seem super fake or a little deranged in our culture. \n\nNot to mention, unfortunately, your sexuality or race can have an impact on your experience as well. But though I understand the need to warn others about those experiences, every city I know has racists and homophobes, and it pains me to see \u201cX City (as a whole) is racist!\u201d because someone bumped into one asshole. In a FB travel group, someone advised a Black woman not to visit my city because she had a terrible racist interaction with another tourist there. Not even someone from here. \n\nI looked up other experiences and accounts from Black women and travel bloggers online, since I have a Black friend visiting soon and wanted to double check things would be OK for her (and any places to potentially avoid), and saw 90% positive or super positive experiences, and 10% \u201cit was so racist and terrible\u201d. So at the end of the day, it just seems to me like judging an entire city full of people based off a few days\u2019 experience at most is always going to be highly subjective.",

Here in America we used to have whole travel guides published specifically for black Americans to know what towns are \"Sundown\" towns. That is, towns where they are likely to be beaten, robbed, or murdered if they're seen out and about after dark. Even if the authors who are writing \"X people are friendly\" are not addressing that sort of thing specifically, it's important to remember that at some point everyone is new to traveling. Being worried that people won't be kind in the place you're traveling to is a common enough fear for those people that someone writing a travel guide or working for a tourism board may want to address immediately.",

There's a lot of places I've seen that reject Koreans who are from Korea and Koreans who are diasporic Koreans.  It's still very much a Confucian society that developed uber fast and still hasn't really caught up in terms of thinking (it was pretty closed off from the world until relatively recently). Not trying to justify things but I think it's also important to know the context. Both Koreas are also the most homogeneous countries in the world (from what I've read) so you can't expect thinking to change overnight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, it's very looks based. If Koreans think you look attractive and rich, regardless of background, there are some clubs that you will get into that other Koreans won't even get into because they don't fit the standard of beauty. -\\_-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will say, the places that reject you anyway, most likely have shit vibes and I'm glad to be rejected from them because I know it won't be fun and I'll most likely have to deal with stuffy types who care too much about what other people think of them.",

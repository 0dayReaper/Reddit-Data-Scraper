    "postText": "Hi! I plan to go to a solo travel in June in Mexico, for 1-2 weeks. This will be my first solo travel. I searched this topic but still have some questions and would be grateful if you can answer it :)\n\n1. I want to do some hikes (I am not experienced hiker but I am young so I can do medium hikes I guess) and generally I want my journey to be nature-oriented, but I also want to go to a beach at least once. Where would you recommend me to be based? Or is it better to spend some days in one place, then in another and so on? If yes, what places would you recommend?\n\n2. Would you recommend me just day hikes, or multiple day hikes also?\n\n3. I want to travel alone, but also I am not confident to go on hikes alone. So would you recommend just to find group hiking tours on the internet? Or find hiking buddies? Can you recommend me good websites on both of this?\n\n4. If you also will go to Mexico at this time, let's connect! If this subreddit allows it of course:)\n\n5. What about going to the beach alone? Usually I always have a friend who watches our clothes and vice versa. How do you solve it when you are alone? \n\n6. There are lots of scattered information on the internet, so I would be grateful if you know one place that you think I must generally read before going to Mexico / on solo travel. Maybe this subreddit wiki is enough though :)\n\n7. I also do some horse riding, if anyone can recommend equestrian hikes / walks, would be great!\n\nI think that's it, sorry for so many questions. I never planned a trip like this before and I am perfectionist \ud83d\ude05",

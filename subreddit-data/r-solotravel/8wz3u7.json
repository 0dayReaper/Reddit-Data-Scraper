We reach the hostel and he\u2019s already reached. Walk into the common area and there he is on a couch playing all the hits singing at the top of his voice. Everyone else was sitting as far away as they could. Except this one Brit guy who was much older and was awkwardly smiling and smoking a joint.  Probably too polite to do anything, even move from his seat while he died inside ever so slowly. The cringe was real. ",

Even Noel basically just says, yeah, I don't know what the fuck any of these lyrics were supposed to mean.

My life really is like I'm slowing walking down the hall faster than a cannonball!\"",

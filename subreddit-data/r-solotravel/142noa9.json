    "postText": "So I would like to preface this by saying I have not been able to find a direct flight from Cusco to Juliaca. But I would like to visit both Machu Pichu and Lake Titicaca. \n\nHowever my preference would to not burn a day or two getting acclimated twice. Does acclimation effectively reset when I fly down from Cusco to Lima just to flight up to Juliaca? I'm traveling solo so getting stuck taking it easy is never fun.",

After all it's similar to what climbers do - repeatedly climb to high altitude and return to a lower one to sleep.   \n\n\nI would suggest considering a bus to Puno. It might be more comfortable than taking two flights and a transport from Juliaca to Titicaca. In Peru you can get a really comfortable one (google *bus cama*). They are both day and night services.",

Spoke to him the next day with his friend and he was still acting odd. Seems he had been strange and unresponsive since arriving and was sober. Turns out the altitude had really fucked him and he had a minor bleed on the brain. Never take altitude changes lightly!",

Any change you would experience by &lt;1 day layover in Lima would have a negligible effect when you return to altitude. I had looked it up on my way back, apparently athletes that train at higher altitude have the benefits carry over for up to two weeks. \n\nThis does go the other way too - most people recommend chilling in Cusco for at least 2-3 days before attempting any multi-day hikes or strenuous activities.",

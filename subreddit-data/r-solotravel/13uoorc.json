    "postText": "Hi solo travelers! First off: my apologies if my post is inappropriate for this sub - I'm new here! I'll provide some additional context (which is probably TLDR) but my main goal of this post is to find out if a solo trip to Jordan is the right fit for me.\r  \n\r  \nI currently live in San Francisco (28m) and I'd like to plan my first international solo trip because I haven't been out of the country since before the pandemic back in 2019. Before COVID, travel was always a major part of my life because my father was a flight attendant for 40 years before he retired recently. As you can imagine, I consider myself slightly more well traveled than others my age but I'm by no means an expert and I always try to remain humble about my experiences because I know I'm incredibly lucky. I promise I'm not trying to brag with this list... I'm merely sharing my past so you can help me decide if I'll be *alright* visiting Jordan on my first solo trip because my partner (who will not be joining me on the trip) is slightly worried about my safety. \r  \n\r  \nFrom the ages of 8-24 I've traveled to:\n\n\u2022\tMexico (Ixtapa, Cancun &amp; Cabo)  \n\u2022\tLondon  \n\u2022\tParis  \n\u2022\tRome  \n\u2022\tJapan (a short four day trip for the Cherry Blossom Festival near Narita)  \n\u2022\tKenya (two separate trips, spent a total of three weeks here)  \n\u2022\tTanzania  \n\u2022\tMalawi  \n\u2022\tZambia  \n\u2022\tZimbabwe  \n\u2022\tBali (spent two weeks here traveling all around the entire island)  \n\r  \n \rI had an amazing time visiting these countries but I was always accompanied by one of my parents. Visiting Jordan to see Petra has been on my bucket list ever since I was a young child... but with my parents growing older I'm coming to terms with the fact that none of my friends or family will want to join me on my dream trip.\r  \n\r  \nAlthough I'm an incredibly independent person, I'm still slightly nervous about visiting the Middle East by myself and wanted to seek some guidance from people on this sub to see if my current plan to visit Jordan in May 2024 might be a little too ambitious for my first ever solo trip. For what it's worth, I do consider myself very 'street smart' in regards to traveling because I live in a big city myself and I've learned so much from my father who spent so much time traveling to other countries for a living. Culture shock also isn't much of a concern after my extensive time traveling in Africa.\r  \n\r  \nI welcome any thoughts, suggestions or input that others may have! Also: do you think one week would be enough to spend adequate time in Amman, Petra and Wadi Rum?\r  \n\r  \nThank you so much in advance!",

            "comment": "Hi! I'm an American woman who's been living in Jordan for 15 years; it's SUPER safe. It's also just an amazingly warm and hospitable country, and as a solo traveler, people will be very welcoming.\nMy friend (also female) and I do road trips outside of Amman every weekend (sometimes to pretty random places), and we always have an amazing time.\nGetting to Petra from Amman is very easy (JETT bus is the most affordable option). You won't need for than 2-3  days max between Petra and Wadi Rum (you may even find time to visit Aqaba; personally I'm not much of a beach person, so Aqaba is the least interesting place in Jordan for me, but if you're into diving, it's heaven). While in Amman, I recommend doing day trips to the Dead Sea and Jerash if you can.\nIn fact, I recommend exploring as much of the country as you can (15 years in, I'm still discovering new places). The only place I advise against visiting is Ma'an in the southeast, but you'll have no reason to go there anyway.\nI also recommend getting the Jordan Pass... it'll save you a lot of money, especially at Petra (and on your visa fee).\n\nIn short: super safe, you'll have no problem managing it solo. I'm happy to help further if you need it.\n\nIf you want to read more about just how safe it is to explore, you can check a couple of my blog posts about Jordan:\nhttps://www.dontfollowmetravel.com/blog/jordans-eastern-desert\n\nhttps://www.dontfollowmetravel.com/blog/foraging-in-the-fertile-crescent",

I recommend paying for a guide at Petra, as there are people who will hassle you to buy stuff, and I just felt a bit more comfortable having a guide to shoo them away. It helps to learn a few words in Arabic too, shukran means thank you. Jordanians use habibi to death as well \ud83d\ude02. Try to visit the Dead Sea and Aqaba too while you\u2019re there. There are many historical sites in an around Amman too, E.g Mount Nebo (where Moses saw the promised land - you can see Jersusalem from here on a clear day). I booked drivers and guides for everything I did there, they were all men but all completely respectable and went out of their way to make me feel comfortable and safe. I came back with many gifts! Jordan is my favourite place I\u2019ve ever been to, so I hope you love it and have a great time too!",

And since it\u2019s just a constant sea of potential buyers - they don\u2019t even really care - it\u2019s just on to the next after, sometimes even you again if you double back and walk around.\n\nIf you want to avoid it, try to stay in one of the accommodations right by the entrance and get there literally as soon as it opens. A lot of those salesmen will wait until the crowds pick up to maximise their time so you\u2019ll have basically the area to yourself for a while and you won\u2019t be bothered much (and if you\u2019re there in the summer, you\u2019ll avoid some of the brutal temps). And a lot of the viewpoints they\u2019ll later cut off for paying \u2018customers\u2019 only will be open for use.",

I assume you've traveled enough to know not to get scammed there, don't accept \"free\" stuff, just say no thank you and walk away.  \nIn Wadi Rum the bedouins we stayed at were great, lovely people.\n\n&gt; do you think one week would be enough to spend adequate time in Amman, Petra and Wadi Rum?\n\nMaybe just enough. I did spend 10 days (including the 2 travel days for flights) and it felt like the perfect amount of time to see the country",

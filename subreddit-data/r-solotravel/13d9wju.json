    "postText": "Wanted to ride the 76 km Shimanami Kaido, I trained for weeks, looked up nutrition, bought cycling shorts, researched logistics etc.\n\nMistake 1: I landed in Osaka at night and hoped for an early morning 6am start to Onomichi. Couldn't sleep , did about 3 hours. On the way both the rubber straps on my luggage broke. My laptop was in it. Reached Onomichi and felt like puking.\n\nMistake 2: Looked for a delivery service to send my luggage to my hotel at the next destination. The only shop open said they could do it in 2 days, after I already left. I had a work call the next day so I needed my laptop and I wasn't cycling 70km with a heavy piece of metal. In the end, I decided to put it in a locker and come back for it at the end of day. Cue premonition music ..\n\nMistake 3: I headed to the cycling rental, the good store was closed and this place had cheap bikes and since I spent so much time wandering, my reservation lapsed and I picked the least worst bike. It could not climb hills.. this would be important shortly.\n\nCycling Adventure: The bike was bad at hills but pretty good on flats and tried to make up for lost time. Nutrition wise I skipped lunch since I had prepared with a heavy dinner and breakfast. The first 2/3, I had a banana, energy gel and hydrated.\n\nCycling Hell: Since I couldn't climb more than a few hundred metres without getting blown out, I pushed upslope for the various 1-5km stretches. Think I might have pushed up 10km instead of riding. The idiotic me decided to bring a heavy mirrorless camera instead of using my phone. For the last 1/3, I had a donut instead of an energy gel. Not sure why but it didn't give me as much energy, just survived the final stretch on pure grit.\n\nI did see the sunset, but was too tired and cold to want to take photos.\n\nMistake 4: It's not over. Finally, I completed in under 6 hours and it was 7pm after showering. I had to make it back to my locker and try to make it to the next town 3 hours away, I'd spend more money going back and forth and time on buses.\n\nI made it back and looked at Google maps. There was no way to make it to my one splurge hotel in time. I called them and ask for early check in the next day, then found the nearest hotel and got a room. It was late again and the small town restaurants all closed early. So I had some konbini curry and protein. \n\nI would have to start off early the next day, so I could get to a proper hotel with proper wifi and get onto my work call.\n\nDespite all the things that went wrong, I still completed the route with a few handicaps. Wish there was a guide somewhere with more details. Now I can start a regular trip :)",

Drove to Imabari and tried to give my bike back at giant Imabari because someone told me I can\u2019t take it with me in the bus. They put it in a bag. Drove back by bus in 2 hours. Arrived at 8pm in Onomichi. Brought the bike back to giant. Had to pay 2750 Yen extra for bring it back to late \ud83d\ude05. But that\u2019s it, when you travel you can\u2019t always be prepared of everything. But these are the things you\u2019re going to remember. At the end of the day I was so happy because I made all the 70km and it was great!",

            "comment": "I don't know anything about cycling but I was wondering if chatGPT would be helpful at all. Is this information too general? Can you think of a more specific prompt that would have been better? This is what it gave me:\n\nRiding the 76 km Shimanami Kaido can be a challenging but rewarding experience. Here are some tips on how to prepare for the ride:\n\nBuild your endurance: Cycling 76 km can be physically demanding, so it's important to train your body for the distance. Start by gradually increasing your cycling distance over several weeks, aiming to cycle 50-60 km comfortably before attempting the full route.\n\nStrengthen your legs: The Shimanami Kaido has some steep climbs, so it's important to build up your leg strength. Incorporate hill training into your cycling routine and focus on exercises that target your quads, hamstrings, and glutes.\n\nGet the right gear: Make sure you have a reliable bike that is comfortable for long rides. Invest in a good pair of cycling shorts with padding to prevent chafing and consider getting cycling shoes with clipless pedals for improved power transfer. Don't forget to wear a helmet and bring appropriate clothing for the weather conditions.\n\nPlan your route: The Shimanami Kaido is a popular cycling route, but it's important to plan your journey carefully to ensure a safe and enjoyable ride. Familiarize yourself with the route and plan your rest stops and meal breaks.\n\nStay hydrated and fueled: Cycling for a long distance can be exhausting, so make sure you stay hydrated and fueled throughout your ride. Bring plenty of water and snacks such as energy bars or bananas to keep your energy levels up.\n\nBe prepared for emergencies: Bring a basic repair kit with spare inner tubes, a pump, and a multi-tool in case of any mechanical issues. Also, make sure you have a fully charged mobile phone in case of emergencies.\n\nRemember to listen to your body and take breaks when needed. With the right preparation, you'll be able to enjoy the stunning scenery and exhilarating experience of cycling the Shimanami Kaido.",

I'm planning this to be a 10 day trip beginning in the first week of August. Having read other posts on this group, I wanna make sure I don't go overboard with the number of places I want to visit especially since I only have 10 days. Since this will be my first solo trip, the nerves are definitely there along with lots of overthinking but also excited!\n\nThat being said, my tentative plan is to visit two places, Prague and Budapest as they are fairly close and accessible through a 6-7 hour train ride. I decided on these two places as they seem to be one of the most recommended cities for solo travellers for various reasons. I'll be arriving in Prague and then going to Budapest by train.\n\nSince this will be my first solo trip, I'd love to meet people and socialize with other travellers which is why I plan on staying in hostels that make it easy to meet people! I'm interested in sight-seeing, learning about the culture of the city and partying/nightlife.\n\nLooking at my travel dates, I'll be having 9 full days/nights and will be flying out on the 10th day. I don't have a strict budget and I'd be willing to pay for experiences/comfort if its worth it. Based on this, I have a few questions:\n\n  \n1. Would 9 full days be enough to spend in Prague and Budapest, or is it too short/too long? Which of the 2 cities should I spend more time in?\n\n2. Do these cities align with my interests and what I'm hoping to do? If not, any other cities I should be looking at?\n\n3. General recommendations for Prague and Budapest based off of personal experiences (places to stay, eat, bars/clubs)?\n\nThank you so much!!",

I did pretty much the exact same trip in December (3 nights in Budapest, 3 nights in Vienna, 2 nights in Prague) and I felt 3 nights in Budapest was enough.\n\n\n2. Both are great cities both for culture and nightlife. In Budapest I really enjoyed going to a thermal bath, going to the Hungarian national museum and museum of fine art, the cathedral, and then spending the evenings going out with people from the hostel.\n\n\n3. I had a great time doing the bar crawls at the Wombats Hostel Budapest and Hostel one Prague- that\u2019s really how you make friends, doing day activities with your hostel roommates and bar crawls. Prague, see all the touristy stuff, the tower, castle etc. it\u2019s popular and packed with tourists for a reason. \n\n\nBonus tip: the RegioJet trains are awesome- 0.8 euro for a 0.5L beer and 0.4 euro for tea. You can have a blast just riding the trains. Hungarian state railway on the other hand\u2026  not worth it.",

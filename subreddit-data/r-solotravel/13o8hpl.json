    "postText": "I'm between jobs this summer and vaguely planning 3 months in Europe. I did the same last year for 9 weeks, I went to Turkey, Georgia, the Baltics, Finland, Paris and Dublin for the flight home. \n\nI prefer to travel slow and not plan too far ahead, if I like a place I would stay another 5 days or something. I love being spontaneous and sometimes I would decide the night before which city I would fly to the next day. But I wasted a lot of money doing last minute flights and accommodation last year. And I keep reading Europe will be even busier this year.\n\nHaving major FOMO at the thought of missing something I really want to see, wasting time in a place I don't like, feeling like this could be my last big trip before I have to start settling down and find a partner and have kids...\n\nWondering if I should revisit my favourite cities from last time or stick to new places. \n\nI love eastern Europe and my dream was always Russia. That won't happen this time. Im a big fan of history especially WW2 history.. My shortlist of absolute must sees is below. \n\nPoland\nPrague\nCroatia \nRomania \nItaly - I will probably fly home from Italy\n\nIf anyone has thoughts or suggestions on getting over FOMO, or suggestions on eastern Europe destinations, I'd love to hear.",

            "comment": "I think for FOMO it can help to know that this won't be your only time traveling, so even if you miss some stuff you want to see this time, you can always just take another trip in future, if you're making travel a priority in your budget and life planning. \n\nIt can also help to make some notes beforehand on things you want to see, prioritize things somehow with \"absolute must-sees\" as top priority, and then, even if you're winging it, you can still loosely try to get to some of the \"top priority\" things, and save others for later if you don't get to them all.\n\nHappy travels!",

For example, Copenhagen for Scandinavia,  Paris for northern Europe, Zurich for central Europe and Rome for southern Europe.   The advantage of this is that you can give yourself some time just relaxing into the local lifestyle and then do 2-3 day trips to visit towns, cities and tourist locations in the region.\n\nEurope is so well connected by high speed trains that you can travel quite long distances in a couple of hours.",

And you can use it for short trips from cities, and sleeper trains between them.\nPlus it's a much much nicer way of travelling round Europe, city stations are almost always in the centre, and you get to meet plenty of interesting people on trains, as well as seeing the scenery \n\nMore at seat61.com",

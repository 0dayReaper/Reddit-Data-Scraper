    "postText": "Hi, I am planning to go to Albania and Montenegro this June for a period of 12 days. I'm thinking of renting a car from Tirana and doing a round trip through Valbona, Durmitor, Kotor/Budva, and Shkoder before returning the car and flying out of Tirana.  \n\n\n1. Is this itinerary too much for 12 days? Right now, I'm thinking of:\n   1. 2-3 days in Koman and Valbona\n   2. 2-3 days in Durmitor\n   3. 4 days in Budva/Kotor \n   4. Remaining 2-3 days in Shkoder and Theth\n2. Do I need to rent a 4x4 for the driving in the national parks area of both countries even though it's summer?\n3. Any recommendations on things I should skip or add to this itinerary?\n4. Any particular hikes you recommend in the national parks that aren't too long? I'm not too keen to hike something that's more than 6-7km.  \nAppreciate all the help!",

            "comment": "Looks a bit tight because the distances take quite a chunk of your time. Are you able to fly back from a different airport or is everything booked?\n\nI would consider skipping Budva and spent an extra day in Durmitor. There are many types of hikes there, but you can go mountainbiking and rafting as well. But i fear you might just need the day to drive there and back.\n\nI don't think that you'll need a 4x4 car, but the roads can be pretty bad and rocky at various places, so don't bring a potato on wheels.",

I'm debating skipping Valbona and going straight from Fierza (the end of the Komani lake ferry) to Durmitor. Could maybe utilise that extra day for Durmitor.\n\nAlso, any suggestions on certain scenic routes I need to keep an eye out for when going from place to place? I heard the Montenegro Coastal Highway is pretty good, but it's a bit hard to plan with Google Maps since it only shows the most efficient routing.",

                            "comment": "Well like i said, probably skip Budva. It's mostly logistics that will save you time. I did a hike from Valbona to Teth, one day to get there from Schkoder and one day of hiking including hitchhiking back. It's something like Schkoder &gt; ferry &gt; Guesthouse near Valbona hiking trail &gt; Hike to Teth &gt; Schkoder. Note that if you want to drive yourself, the southern ferry docks are quite a challenge. You'll be in a tunnel that exits on a tiny dock full of cars and people that try to get on.\n\nIf you're not staying in Tirana, wouldn't it make more sense to fly in at Kotor? You could do something like: Kotor &gt; Schkoder &gt; Valbona/Teth &gt; Durmitor &gt; Kotor. That would save you a lot of time.\n\nI can't remember specific scenic routes, but the Coastal Highway has nice parts and the road is good. The road from Kotor to Durmitor was rocky in a lot of parts. Keep in mind that most of the country is just mountains. So for the rest i would stick to the fastest routes.",

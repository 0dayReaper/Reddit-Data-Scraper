    "postText": "I have a coworker who backpacked throughout Southeast Asia for a few months (pre-covid). When he asked me if I\u2019d ever traveled outside the states I told him about a 3 week trip I took to Europe. He then told me that I didn\u2019t *really* experience it the way I should have because I stayed in Airbnb\u2019s where I had the whole place to myself. He also said I should have gone somewhere in Southeast Asia because it\u2019s more authentic. It really rubbed me the wrong way. I think everyone has their own places they want to see and their own way of making that happen. It\u2019s cool to give recommendations, but it\u2019s really rude to tell someone how they should travel or that they didn\u2019t really \u201cexperience\u201d traveling.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with someone like this?",

Bangkok is authential Thai... everywhere is different and authentic in its own way.\n\nCoworker sounds like a twerp. Traveling looks different for everyone and thar's okay as long as you're respecting the place and having fun.",

SE Asia is probably the #2 most popular destination for backpackers after Europe. It\u2019s not some kind of \u201chidden gem\u201d that no Westerner has ever been to.\n\nI also dislike the entire idea of \u201chidden gems\u201d when it comes to traveling. People who are only obsessed with seeing things that aren\u2019t \u201ctouristy\u201d miss out on a lot of good places. \n\nMany times, the reason why touristy locations are touristy is because they\u2019re WORTH visiting. The Colosseum is no less grand because a lot of people go see it. In fact, the popularity is an indication of how many people are willing to go across the globe just to lay eyes on it.\n\nMost of the time people take this pretension to the opposite extreme and completely avoid all of the best stuff just so they can say they went off the beaten path and end up with a mediocre experience. \n\nImagine you applied this same logic to your home country (in my case, the US): NYC is the most populous city (therefore the worst because it\u2019s touristy) so you should visit North Dakota instead. It\u2019s just dumb.",

When I got back to my hotel and did the math, I realized that I walked away from something I really liked over $.25. It was a lesson to me. I rarely shop, but when I do, it's generally for something specific. So, I'll ask a local how much it would cost and then I negotiate with that in mind and a willingness to pay a tourist tax, which I feel is fair. \n\nI was out to dinner once with a group of people in mexico and this guy bought something from a street vendor. He haggled so hard, I felt terrible for this poor woman. You could tell she was making 0 profit on the sale and he took so long that she probably could have sold multiple other things during the time. I was just like dude, pay her the extra $1 and let her earn a little money. The tip he left for the server was more than the cost of what he bought. It was so annoying.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on sex tourists. I've seen way too much of that and it makes me rage.",

And before I explain why I\u2019ll firstly state that Vietnam is definitely one of my favourite countries ever, just about everything about it is amazing.\n\nBut in my experience when you encounter the increased foreigner prices in places like Thailand, Indonesia, Phillipines etc. it\u2019s pretty consistent. 2 unrelated foreigners go to buy something, they\u2019re likely to get the same increased price. I\u2019m cool with that.\n\nIn Vietnam it\u2019s almost a national sport on who can rip off the foreigner. You might get a ridiculously inflated price because they don\u2019t like the way you look, or they\u2019re in a bad mood etc. and the ironic thing is the white foreigners don\u2019t even get the worst of it. I have friends born in a western country but Vietnamese background who\u2019ve gone there and they get ripped off the worst, not sure the logic behind that.",

However, the hard haggling is what I'm talking about. I wasn't clear that what I wanted to talk about are the tourists who haggle so hard with everyone without even an ounce of context or knowledge what the price really is. They just assume they are getting ripped off at every turn. I guess not entirely an unreasonable assumption but there's something they can do to avoid that.\n\nIt pays to be smart like connecting with locals (your airbnb host, hostel admin, whoever you can kinda trust) so you know the prices so you don't get ripped off.  I guess that is too much to ask from some. It's a longer conversation but in poor countries, the scarcity and \"me against the world\" mindset is intense especially among poor people (and x10 in countries like mine where there is almost 0 social safety net) and that can manifest in behavior like ripping off tourists. Not excusing the behavior by any means but the person with more resources who can be better equipped to avoid an unfavorable encounter I think should do the work. Avoiding the feeling of getting ripped off I hope is enough to incentivize people to integrate on a level where they're at least informed...  \n\n\nI am a local and I still get 'ripped off'. My approach is if it's not insanely overpriced is to say.. Ok I'll pay that but I know the real price and I hope this money can help you. You'll be surprised how showing kindness can have them rethink. \n\nI feel like in post-covid travel, there will be a lot of incidents like this especially because of this long stretch of no income for street vendors in tourist spots. \n\nI hope you have better experiences ahead!",

You then have to define what is authentic, What is an authentic travel experience? And if you try to seek that out, is that really authentic anymore?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI normally don't feel the need to respond to those people. I figure they have self esteem issues and are usually projecting and travel is their way to feel superior. Since I feel comfortable in how I travel, they don't really get to me. It's like people who randomly tell me how many countries they've been to without me asking. I find it annoying but I also feel bad for them that they seem to find such an identity wrapped up in something so silly.",

Like you're going to experience a lot more spending a week in southern India and a week in northern India or doing a road trip across the USA than you are spending three days racing between the capitals of lithuania Latvia and estonia so what does a number even tell you? It's about as arbitrary an item as it is possible to collect and I don't see what pleasure you can derive from it unless you think people are going to be impressed by it. It also encourages seeing travel as a box ticking exercise which I think is a terrible way to travel.\n\nNow I'm not gatekeeping and everybody should just do what they want of course.

The convo went something like:\n\nMe: \"you should really go to &lt;other city in same country&gt; it's amazing!\"\n\nHim: \"I will never make enough money to be able to travel there. It's cheap for you, but it's expensive for me.\"\n\nIt was a good reminder that for me dropping $100 on a flight was no big deal but for him, that was food for a month for his family.",

The Swiss guy was super pretentious because \"he spoke 5 languages\" and really pushed how well travelled he was and how we weren't really experiencing places.\n\nSo it transpires that Mr Switzerland has been to 33 countries and the American guy is amazed saying he thinks he's been to maybe 9. Conversation continues and it turns out that The American guy lived in China for 18months teaching basketball, his boss was super wealthy and he did all these wild things whilst he was there!\n\nSome people get carried away by box ticking and should just treasure their experiences more. There's always time to travel more if that's what you want to do. In my eyes living somewhere like China far outstrips anything else because it's such a unique experience and it's unlikely the rest of around the table will ever get to do something like that.\n\nBut seriously though, walk your own path and travel your own way. No way is right or wrong",

It makes them feel as if they've experienced something as if they're a local and that it gives them a unique perspective unavailable to someone else. I travelled around thailand for three weeks once and I had a British backpacker tell me, \"oh you're not traveling, you're on holiday.\" Motherfucker i get three weeks off work and I chose to travel around Thailand. People like that can go shove it, truthfully. You get out when you can and how you can.",

I'm from the epicenter so I felt paranoid but they took it as criticism and felt like I didn't have a right to talk as an American.

I think they are equating European travel with package tour type travel that carts you from one tourist trap to another, and southeast Asian travel as backpacking around solo to places that don't typically get many tourists. Now this isn't quite accurate because there are plenty of non touristy areas in Europe and vice versa in southeast Asia but that's the perception at least.\n\nAlso don't really follow your point on supporting the local economy - tourists are much more likely to pay above market rates on everything in southeast Asia than Europe simply because they can afford to (often double triple or five times the price) so they have a much bigger positive impact on the local economy in poor countries than rich ones",

It could have gone better, but it was my fault it didn\u2019t because I just wasn\u2019t prepared. Meanwhile, a friend and her sister went on a 3-week tour of Europe with a group. When we came home, she kept trying to play the one-up game with me because she went to all the countries. No idea why, but it was annoying. Honestly, she had way more fun than me, so it wasn\u2019t like I was competing to win for Best Summer Abroad. Whatever.\n\n2. People who shit all over you for choosing certain destinations \u2014 Everyone is different. Everyone travels for different reasons and enjoys different places. There is no reason to be negative about a certain place if you hate it but someone else loves it. For example, people ask me where my favourite place is. I always say Paris. Some people take that as an opportunity to go on a long rant about how much they hate Paris and how terrible their experience was there. That\u2019s great. I don\u2019t care. To me, Paris is fucking magical. If you don\u2019t get it, you don\u2019t get it. You\u2019re not going to change my mind by cornering me and subjecting me to your negative rant. I don\u2019t know why people do this, but it\u2019s so annoying!\n\n3. People who judge you for choosing to be a \u201ctourist\u201d over \u201cbeing authentic\u201d \u2014 I ran into this with New Orleans. The locals do not like AirBnB for a very good reason: they hate loud, drunk tourists coming into their residential neighborhoods to throw crazy house parties. They like to keep their tourists in the French Quarter. The last time I went, I was mindful of this. I stayed at a hotel in the French Quarter, did all the touristy things, and ate at all the restaurants. I was happy to give my money to the tourism industry. Along comes another tourist who tells me I\u2019m not really having the \u201cauthentic New Orleans experience\u201d by staying in the FQ. I was just like, \u201cBro, all of the locals literally hate you right now.\u201d\n\n4. People who get mad if you prefer luxury travel or service upgrades (such as flying business class or staying in a nicer hotel) \u2014 This is usually just jealousy. And I get it. But look, I\u2019m going to be real. I\u2019m not 22 anymore. As others on this thread have said, I like private rooms, comfortable seats, and hot showers. I spend more money to be comfortable now  because I did the budget travel thing when I was young and I learned some hard lessons. It\u2019s okay to change your preferences as you get older. Spend as much or as little as you want. It\u2019s your trip. Who cares?",

Especially as I make my way through my late twenties I find myself just wanting people to be happy, to laugh, and do whatever they find fun/ cool. I have less and less room for pretentious people. We are all just trying to navigate our lives and find some happiness. My friend and I were just talking about how  we both have secret favorite movies that we don\u2019t feel able to share because they aren\u2019t the most brilliant, or deep movies. Lol, we then decided we were going to start sharing our real favorites and not feeling bad about it. I can assure you your travels were just as wonderful as his if not more so. That would have def gotten under my skin. Cheers.",

Not everyone who travels has the same means, interests, or comfort zones.\n\nThe wrong vacation for you can be a nightmare. The right one a dream come true.\n\nAlso, I too don\u2019t couch surf or stay in dorms anymore, bc I\u2019m old and picky about my privacy &amp; comfort.\n\nSidebar: When I lived in Germany my niece came to visit me. She had never traveled before. We visited the major attractions in multiple cities &amp; she was amazed. She thought it was exotic &amp; very different from her life. She enjoyed sampling French cheeses &amp; was open to trying properly made escargot. It blew her mind. For her vacation had been staying in a hotel with a pool or a beach, inside the USA. I was surprised that she thought it was exotic bc to me it was just slightly different. She had a wonderful time as did I. It was kind of refreshing seeing her excitement bc my excitement level was muted from experience. \n\nIf you were happy, then you did your travel experience right. It\u2019s great to talk to people who try different things bc maybe their experience can lead you to more. But your coworker is an ass. Ignore him.",

(Side note:  we originally were booked for summer 2020, got cancelled, and are now booked for 2022, so hopefully COVID will be a memory.)\n\nI've told people about these plans and many, many people aren't excited for me because of their anti-cruise snobbery.  It's crazy!  Some of them have said things like, \"That's not the way to see Europe,\" or, \"Only having a day in a city is not enough time at all, you really need more time than that.\"\n\nI'm like, oooookay.  First, a week or even a month in one city often isn't enough time to see everything there is to see and on any trip you have to prioritize what you do/see based on your time.  Second, it is definitely A way to see Europe, and a lot of it in a short amount of time.  Third, don't push your values onto me or my dad.  He wants an easy way to see a bunch of different places that also offers the ability for each of us to do something different if needed without much coordination.  He doesn't want to backpack from place to place and unpack and repack everyday or worry about the language barrier the whole time.  Cruising is a valid way to travel.\n\nNow, it might not be what I would book on my own, but I am so excited to do this with my dad and did I mention, he's paying?  So why trash on my free vacay?  Who would turn down a free vacation just because it isn't 100% what they would do on their own?  Snobs and rich people is the answer.",

Enjoy your tacos.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nT: &lt;In a snarky pissed off voice after realizing i've been on my laptop all day instead of out sight seeing&gt; Why bother even traveling if you're just going to sit around all day on your laptop? You might as well stay home.\n\nM: Well, sometimes you just have to get some stuff done.\n\nT: Checking facebook and gaming can wait. You're not even experiencing anything. I didn't even bother bringing a laptop because I wanted to have a REAL^TM travel experience and not be distracted by technology.\n\nM: Yeah, it can be good to disconnect if you have the chance.\n\nT: You have to make the chance. You're wasting your entire trip. How much more time do you have before you go home? Will you even get to see anything?\n\nM: Well, I've been in this town for 4 months and intend to stay another 3-4. I've been on the road for x years with no plans to head home any time soon. Because I occasionally spend the day working on my laptop, I can continue to travel pretty much forever. But I'm sure your two weeks will be great. You can always come back and see all the stuff you miss.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nT: When did you get here?\n\nM: I arrived yesterday.\n\nT: Oh! A newbie! I've been backpacking all over Europe for 3 months, I go home in a week. Let me tell you what you need to do to make the most out of your trip.\n\nT: &lt;drones on for 30 minutes about a bunch of random shit no one cares about&gt;\n\nT: So, how long are you here?\n\nM: I'm not sure. It depends on how much I like it. I've been traveling around Europe for about 6 years now but this is my first time in this city. I'll stay a couple days or maybe a couple months, we'll see how it goes.\n\n\n\ni rarely meet someone who has been on the road longer than i have and i pretty much never bring up my travel background unless directly asked because i know how privileged it is that i can live this life and i think it's a bit douchey to toss it out there randomly.",

Or if I\u2019ve gone on a singular trip to one country and people get snobby when I say I\u2019m not headed somewhere else afterwards. Not every trip needs to be a 6 month long one.",

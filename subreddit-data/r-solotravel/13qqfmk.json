    "postText": "Hello everyone, I (18M) am about to finish a 30 day solo cycling trip from the Netherlands to Rome. On my trip I visited Florence, which was a major disappointment to me as it was *extremely* busy. Florence is a nice city, but it absolutely cannot handle the amount of tourists it receives and beyond the dozen or so sights to see the city really had nothing to offer for me. I am quite used to European cities as my parents and I used to travel alot, so seeing a city like Florence being as flooded with tourists as it was surprised me. In most cities I have visited on my cycling trip I have tried to avoid popular attractions and instead visit places that locals go to or are otherwise not geared to tourists (Florence was geared to tourists to such an extent that it felt disgenuine and fake to me).\n\nSo now that I am about to arrive in Rome I want to be slightly more prepared and try to visit interesting parts of the city that are not as busy and touristy as the main attractions.  Since this is my first time in Rome I will obviously visit places like the St. Peter, the forum Romanum etc. But after about 3 days of that I think I will mostly have seen all main sights. After this I have mabye 1 or 2 days left to see some other parts of the city. Which less well known parts of Rome would you recommend, and what was your experience exploring them on your solo travels?",

I\u2019m sure they exist because it\u2019s a big city.\n\nI can\u2019t really recommend any because I stayed pretty much in the centre - only going as far as Trastevere, which is more relaxing but still plenty of tourists. \n\nI was told, by a Roman, that I should stay in Monteverde next time.",

I stayed in Monti during my time in Rome and had a chat with a local who told me tourists don\u2019t usually stay there, though it is close to the Colosseum. Prati is really nice if you stay away from the Vatican, but seemed pretty expensive to stay in. Outside of the heart of Rome, Testaccio and Monteverde might be good options? I didn\u2019t spend much time there, but my art history professor recommended them to get off the beaten path a bit. Hope you find what you\u2019re looking for!",

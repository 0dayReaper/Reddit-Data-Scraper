    "postText": "For most of my life I traveled with my family. Now as a single guy with money I\u2019ve traveled with friends. Recently on a work trip to Miami I extended it so I can enjoy the weekend in Miami all on my own. First time traveling alone.\n\nOverall I felt the experience to be pretty empty. I had some fun though.\n\nHighlight of the trip was just relaxing at the beach. Vizcaya museum and the botanical garden were let downs because its not as enjoyable alone. Drinking and eating alone wasn\u2019t that fun either. I did enjoy the few interactions I had with strangers at different bars. But that just highlights how much better it would have been with someone with me.\n\nThe way I see it, life isn\u2019t about the destination, but the journey there. Traveling, even with a complete stranger would have been better than doing it alone. What\u2019s the point of having these experiences with nobody to share it with?\n\nSure, traveling with someone else requires compromise. But they also can come up with ideas on things to visit that you might not have thought of. I\u2019m already on day 4 of being alone in Miami, the loneliness really sinks in when you go to bed at a random time, and wake up at a random time. \n\nTraveling alone really is just walking around and looking at stuff. Experiencing things with other people is what makes it dynamic.",

I perosnally simply enjoy my own company and don't feel the need to share the moment with anyone, but not everyone is like that. So you learned something about yourself, good for you.",

Yes, of course having the right people to share your experiences with can be amazing. And going it alone can also be amazing. There are lots of things that are uniquely nice about traveling with someone else - sharing the experience, having someone else to rely on, having someone to reminisce about an experience later, having someone else to socialize with - and there are lots of things that are uniquely great about solo traveling - *not* having someone else to rely on, *not* having someone you have to always socialize with, making entirely your own decisions without needing to compromise on anything you want to do, having complete control over the experience, having time to reflect on an experience totally on your own. \n\nSome people may prefer one way over the other, but one isn't inherently better or worse than the other, and it's not, as you so flippantly put it, just down to having shitting people in your life.",

If you have to travel for work, it\u2019s important to get into a groove so you like it ok, but otherwise, just travel with your loved ones.  And enjoy.",

When I go out to meet friends I like to go out way earlier and just chill by myself, eat something, and just enjoy being present. Always have a blast with friends too but I prefer to solo travel because I can do whatever I choose to do with my days. \n\nOnce in a while I enjoy the odd trip with a friend or two but usually I would also find some way to just spend half a day or more by myself and my friends are all very understanding of it. I find that a very liberating feeling.\n\nI think it\u2019s also worth asking yourself what it is about being alone that you don\u2019t like as much. Humans are social creatures for sure (for the most part) and usually for me I can go maybe a week before really craving some companionship but once that quota is filled I\u2019m good to go again.",

Sometimes you may even have to try a city again to like it.

I didn't want to look back on my deathbed and be upset not to have traveled.\n\nYou sound young. You will find there are times people are scared, or don't have the time or money to go with you on vacation. Do you really NOT want to see things because of someone else's availability?",

My experience is that solo gives more intense experiences, it's easier to come in contact with other people and you can decide on the fly to change plans in order to make most of opportunities that come up and new info/insights you get. Travel with other people you tend to be more in a bubble of your own, it's more of a 'safe space' and in general less adventurous.",

I don't do those activities solo, as I find that the enjoyment (for me) comes from doing them with other people.

I really prefer to explore new places on my own. I genuinely enjoy it so much. There is nothing better in the world than to sit at a small river side bar somewhere in Luang Prabang on a sunny day with a glass of cold beer and a good book in my hand. When I get tired of reading the book, I put my head phones on and listen to some upbeat music while watching the small boats passing by the bar. Ahhhh. This is so beautiful.",

It sounds like you were lonely and weren't spending your time in a way that felt valuable to you. That's ok. Solo travel may not be for you, or maybe you just need to find activities that will engage you more. Sometimes I get lonely when travelling alone and I don't have a lot of things to keep me busy or engaged.

    "postText": "Sorry if this isnt the right place for this\n\n\nThis isn't an exciting travel situation, but I have a weekend to spend in Boston. All tickets are non refundable and it's really important for me to go.\n\nI recently recovered from being sick and I get tired way to easily. My main issue is nutrition, my appetite is zero and that's not great for my energy levels. \n\nI'm usually pretty energetic and have enjoyed traveling solo and doing miles of walking everyday for 3 weeks. \n\nI have two concerns,\n\n1. Not being able to see enough Boston (I know 2 days is still not enough) and enjoy my trip and sometimes its difficult for me to reconcile with that. It's hard for me to take it easy. Lol\n\n2. In case I get sick. I'm scared that I might feel faint or maybe even pass out in the middle of something when I'm alone. (I asked a friend to come with but they are flakey and it's a whole thing.). I'm obviously going to hydrate like crazy, but I don't want to get sick publicly or get stranded somewhere if I do feel sick\n\n\nHave you guys had this issue? How did you deal with that? Do you have any suggestions on how I can make my trip better? I'm just not sure how to deal with this. \n\nP.S. I'm totally fine otherwise, clean bill of health from the doc, no pains, etc. Just the weakness that comes after getting sick.",

I also carry a few cliff bars with me as well. \n\nI have a very hard time eating in the morning. So being able to wake up and drink nutrition is helpful. Also during the day when I may not remember to eat, always having a protein bar is good to help me bridge the gap.",

Also, although usually most of inner Boston is walkable, you could always just ride the T 1-2 stops frequently. Print a good map with the T lines and mark out the places you want to see and the closest stops.",

            "comment": "Ahh my home city!  Depending on the time of year you\u2019re visiting, a Segway tour might be your safest bet seeing the city.  It\u2019s not really physically exerting and covers all the main points you\u2019d otherwise see if you walk the Freedom Trail.  The T (MBTA) stops and walking directions can be found by using Apple Maps if you have an iPhone.  I would stay somewhere central to the attractions you want to see.  I\u2019ve done Boston as a tourist when I took my husbands niece and we stayed at The Bostonian Hotel which is across the street from Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market.  Save your feet and energy and take an Uber to your hotel.  \n\nI agree with taking packets of Liquid IV.  That stuff is great!  Try to focus on protein intake and less carbs.  Fuel up even when you\u2019re not that hungry by having frequent small meals.  I can recommend some great restaurants if you\u2019re interested.",

You get transportation directly to the attractions; you can get off and explore whenever you want, and get picked up later at the same spot or any other stop; or if you are exhausted, you can just stay on the bus and watch the scenery.\n\nIf you have a travel guidebook with you, you essentially get an inexpensive tour of the city without having to walk everywhere.\n\nSome Hop-on Hop-off tours include cruises, which I also highly recommend for exhausted travelers: a lovely way to relax, eat, and enjoy the sights.\n\nI took my tours in Europe, but it's the same idea in Boston: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g60745-Activities-c42-t229-Boston_Massachusetts.html\n\nPro tip: be careful not to confuse the names of the tour operators, which can sometimes be very similar; they may use different schedules and stops, and require separate tickets.",

Adjust your pace based on your energy levels. People watching is a great way to rest and replenish your batteries. \n\n2. So what if you do? Nobody knows you. Just say you're just getting over an illness, still recuperating. That should be information for a stranger. If you saw someone fall in public, that answer would be enough for you. \n\nTravelling with poor health is easy, as long as you listen to your body. You'll be good.",

I thought it was a gimmick, but I tried it in dubai where it was at least 90 farenheit. First 3 days didn't take it and tired out from sweating/heat within 5 hours drinking just water every hour.\n\nI then started taking the dripdrops and was able to keep going all day by consuming one packet every 2-3 hours. It's not like a caffeine/energy boost or anything like that. You'll just keep on trucking.",

You can also rest along the waterfront in the Seaport and watch the boats. There\u2019s a bookstore in the seaport now if you want to pick something up to read. The city is small so the walks will be short or just Uber. The cost is not too bad. \nThere\u2019s lots of stores and coffee shops if you\u2019re out and need some water or something to give you energy. People here are nicer than they might seem and if you\u2019re really not feeling good they\u2019ll help you!",

Someone reminded me that sitting in a cafe or park with a book can be part of traveling as well.\n\nI took a lot of electrolyte drink mixes and drank smoothies because I had almost no appetite. I made sure to know how close benches or seating was if I wasn't feeling great, or sometimes just sat in the grass in park.\n\nI also had to be more realistic about what I was capable of accomplishing on my trip, and what were the goals of the trip. I made the decision that it wasn't about doing everything, and I picked the 2 or 3 or 4 main things I wanted to see in each place and made those a priority over anything else.\n\nI hope you feel better and you have a wonderful trip!",

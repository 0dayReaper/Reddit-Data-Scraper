    "postText": "Seems like the daily topic of conversation in this sub is safety and challenges of being a solo female traveler. I'm NOT comparing experiences, but I wonder what the experience here for men has been in general.\n\nDepending on the country, I've been accosted by sketchy dudes offering illegal strip clubs, drugs, or straight up prostitutes in several countries. Could be inside the bar or in the street. There's also of course working girls at bars that flirt with you and, when you buy them a drink, it comes up as 2x-3x on the bill (they are working for the bar/club...)\n\nTwice, another random traveler has threated or tried to fight me. Once when I changed the AC temp in the hostel dorm at night - he started getting in my face about it during breakfast and hostel staff had to tell him to simmer down, another time when I was talking to someone's gf apparently and they were drunk, they clumsily shoved me while shouting cusswords, I just left the bar\n\nOther than that, I do feel very safe on public transportation and in the street during the day wherever I am. At night, I try to avoid being alone or drunk in public because that's an unnecessary robbery risk no matter your gender\n\nOne small thing I do notice is that both men and women are much friendlier to women in hostels. When I'm in a common area or even when I go out in a group tour or bar crawl, I do have those rare times where I can tell absolutely no one is interested in talking to me, and it sucks. But that could be just me!",

I used to travel to Ukraine a lot pre-war, as there was a cheap connection between my place and Kyiv. I've been told that prostitution is illegal several times by border police when I just wanted to see old buildings and Soviet stuff. \ud83d\ude05 Never happened when I travelled with my girlfriend of course.",

Because we were obviously travelling together, he didn't get any obvious offers. But we did see a LOT of couples in Thailand and Cambodia of the older white man with younger local woman variety. I generally don't like to make assumptions based on how people look, but when you see a pattern repeating often enough (especially in places with high levels of economic disparity), it's obvious enough what's going on. Quite sad, really.",

It was a sketchy place, and it was clearly being used for drugs, but I had to pee bad, and no one was inside, so I went quick.\n\nAs soon as I zipped up, I see 4 guys come in and my Spidey senses started going off (I'm actually breathing hard just typing this), my gut told me I needed to *get out quick* and I just ran out, squeezing past, with the last guy trying to grab my shirt.

Not to mention in so much of the world I'm illegal and could even be thrown in jail or executed. So you have to learn to keep things private and always have pictures of you with a girl on your phone to say they're your girlfriend back home!\n\nBut on the other *other* hand, there's a number of gay dating apps that get you in touch with actual locals that, if nothing else, are good for making a new friend and a free tour guide.

Everyone should practice basic street smarts and situational awareness. \n\nI sometimes hear men say things like \"oh, I'm a 6 foot dude so I don't have to guard my drinks / watch where I'm going / be cautious when meeting strangers\". But when we travel, we all put ourselves in unfamiliar situations where we don't necessarily know the language or culture, or where we stick out.

But that also means they are more likely to get into a confrontation even at relatively low stakes whereas a woman will be more likely to do whatever they can to avoid that.\n\nThis also means that men are simply more likely to be in these dangerous situations in the first place, e.g. being alone late at night in a bad area, being drunk without friends around so they are more likely to be targeted due to that factor of being available at the time and place crime is likely to occur. \n\nWomen on the other hand, know these situations are dangerous and take great steps to avoid them. Men think, 'nah I'll be fine walking home drunk in this unlit area known for crime, I did a few boxing lessons when I was 16 so I can probably still handle myself if some thug tries to mug me'. \n\nMost of the time, they might indeed be fine as no-one will try to mug them, but then if they do get mugged and try and fight back then maybe they get stabbed or beaten and now they are another crime statistic. \n\nThis is mostly thanks to testosterone which typically makes men far more tolerant of these higher levels of risk and also more likely to respond forcefully to threats of violence or really any perceived threat or slight against themselves as they usually think they can handle themselves (whether rightly or wrongly).",

I have traveled with other solo female backpackers who were white, and each time the difference in experience blows me away. People wanting to chat, locals offering free chai, offering a lift, wanting to hang out. It's crazy. \n\nWhen I travel, it's pretty much solo unless I make the effort to reach out. A bit similar to a male traveler's experience (except that I'm 5ft tall and petite so people aren't scared of me or think I'm out to scam them). \n\nI feel ya, bud.

In one of those countries where they worship whiteness and bleach their skin, an art gallery owner wanted to take pictures of patrons to advertise his gallery, so we lined up, but he told my friends to go away and only wanted me. And I was followed and stalked because, again, that country has a weird relationship with whiteness and I\u2019m darn near ghostly. \n\nBut experiences like that - my friends and I agreeing to use me to get good tables and service, and me having to practically step behind my friend who *knew the language* so that someone would address her instead of me\u2026 eye opening and so stupid",

Most significantly, locals often just naturally trust me and want to help me. If I'm in a bad situation and need help, I can usually depend on getting it. No one is suspicious of my motives or thinks I'm trying to scam or hurt them. If a guy is creeping on me in a populated area I can scream and make a scene and locals will usually come to my defence.\n\nWhich is not to say that travelling as a solo woman is easy. Over the 10+ years that I've been travelling, often in sketchy parts of the world, I've been threatened, molested, and been in situations where I legitimately feared for my life. But these bad experiences, even though they still affect me, are relatively rare in the broader scope of my travels, and my experience - again, in 10+ years of solo travelling as a woman - is that most people want to help me, not hurt me.\n\nSo yeah, I feel you. When I first started out at ~19, I honestly felt bitter about \"how much better\" male travellers had it, but after accumulating some experience of my own, I genuinely feel that it's the opposite. Maybe I'd feel differently if something REALLY bad happened to me (like being actually kidnapped/raped instead of \"just\" stalked/molested). But I'm legitimately sympathetic to the challenges men face as solo travellers.",

But at the same time, I blend in better in countries where people have brown skin even if it's from a culture totally different to mine, and I'm less likely to be targeted for scams. So yeah it's healthy for all of us to discuss how our skin colour and gender advantages and disadvantages us during travel",

I was trying to get a good angle because the design of the building entrance and props used were pretty nice, so I was pacing back and forth, but two cops noticed.\n\nThey asked some questions and I showed them the photos I was taking. I explained that I was a tourist and I'm just here to check out how Halloween is celebrated in Sydney, and they apologized and left me. I guess it didn't help that I was wearing a bright red jacket at night where everyone was dressed as black or white.\n\nI still left the area, as I took that as a sign to head back. Admittedly, I was also a bit shaken but I take that moment as more of a positive than a negative:\n\n* It showed that police presence is good in Sydney\n* They didn't think of me as a tourist\n* It shows they take stalker threats seriously as I probably looked like one.\n\nWas it racially charged? I don't think so. One of the cops was Asian (a bit Chinese or Malaysian-looking) and there were lots of SEA-looking people around, too.\n\nThe question is, would I have been treated the same way if I was a woman? Probably no, not because of sexism but because of statistics. Men are just more likely to be creeps and pervs than women.",

One of them pulled a knife out and I really freaked out so I started running as soon as a little gap opened up in-between them. They tried to hit me and kicked me a little while I was running out of their circle but for some miraculous reason I ended pushing through without tripping over or getting hurt.

I like to have a few drinks but I don't like clubs, party hostels or wild partying in general so I haven't had many of the negative experiences you mentioned.\n\nThe one thing that does occasionally frustrate me is women (especially conventionally attractive white women travelers) in hostels assuming that when I start a conversation, all I want is to hook up with them. When really I just want to have a conversation with another traveler or want to find someone to do an excursion or activity with, and I don't care if that person is a woman, man, attractive or not, and I'm not looking to get laid.\n\nHowever, I can't blame them either because it seems lots of guys just travel to get laid now, so as a result someone like me who just wants to have a chat or find someone to do an activity with is also lumped into that basket. I hate playing the race card, but the fact that I'm brown-skinned doesn't help first impressions as there's lots of unconscious bias around.\n\nHaving said that, it's not a big issue because in most cases, with a little bit of conversation, it's easy to give off a non-threatening vibe and make friends.",

They were a couple and the girl even took the same bus as me and paid for my ticket since I only had euros and the driver didn't take them. It was very nice in the end. I also meet people online through gay sites / apps but yeah one should be careful with that. I'm usually too shy to actively approach strangers to make friends but sometimes I get approached by solo female travelers and we become travel buddies! Which is awesome! \ud83e\udd17 I guess they get some vibe about me since my best friends are usually straight women \ud83d\ude01.",

Usually a taxi driver ripping you off. But the worst was in Turkey going for a haircut. They ended up doing more and more (I was thinking it was included and part of the haircut, then it felt too long and they kept doing starting something new before the previous thing was finished - you can't exactly just walk out with stuff all over your hair/face). It was meant to be \u00a312 at most - got ripped off for \u00a3140! I was so angry but being outnumbered and threatened I felt it was just safer to pay it.\n\nThe only other time I felt unsafe was Morocco - helping a girl from a tour we were on to her new hotel at night with another guy (so neither of us had to travel back alone). A guy wanted to help show us the way (we didn't need help and knew the way), but he still followed. Then demanded money for assisting us, all the way back to our taxi (which then didn't want to start).\n\nI'm a fairly big/tall guy with a big beard, so probably most people wouldn't do much, but there are the few occasions you still feel uneasy.",

I didn't really feel threatened or anything - though it can be an exploitative and dangerous line of work for the workers themselves, especially if there's not really any system in place to create safeguards etc. - but yeah being approached by sex workers is probably statistically more likely to happen to men.\n\nI'd be curious if male travelers are approached more often by drug dealers. In Morocco and to a lesser extent Nepal I had a *lot* of people try to sell me weed, no clue if my gender played into that at all. \n\nOccasionally other men try to ask me questions or engage in conversations that I don't feel comfortable with. For instance, sexist stuff about women, \"locker room talk\"-type conversations that I don't want to be part of. Similarly, sometimes men from outside the US will ask me weird and occasionally slightly invasive questions about whether dating and sex in the US is really like it looks in the movies. In cases like that I try to be understanding since there really are stereotypes about the US and \"western\" dating, but it also can be awkward.\n\nLastly I will say I had one experience of an unwanted sexual advance where an older man, who must have assumed I was gay or maybe hoped that I was, propositioned me for sex after a brief conversation. It was a bit startling, although he didn't persist when I said no and said goodbye, so it could have been worse. I don't see all that many accounts of unwanted advances men might experience from other men but I do occasionally see similar stories, so it's still a thing that can happen.",

Especially when it comes from people who claim to be \u201cprogressive\u201d. \n\nThen there\u2019s the darker side where locals will actually attack you or give you abuse for it.

            "comment": "Typically the most annoying thing has just been the annoying people on the streets trying to sell me prostitutes, drugs, etc. In some places they can be very aggressive - for example in Kuta, Bali, Roppongi/Shinjuku, Thailand, Malta, etc. In Barcelona I remember a prostitute getting pissed when I declined, angrily telling me \"well you'll need to because you're not getting any tonight\"\n\nIn Kyiv I once went on a Tinder \"date\" where the girl took me to some bar that she'd chose, racked up an absurd bill ordering all the most expensive stuff on the menu while barely eating anything, then of course expected me to pay. Afterwards she asked me if I wanted to take her to Victoria's Secret to buy her some lingerie, and then when I declined asked me to buy her cab home, which I also declined.\n\nI don't use Tinder because I get nothing on there, but just out of curiosity I opened it in Bali, and of course the only girl that I exchanged messages with, once off the app, starts trying to sell me sex.\n\nOnce in Krakow I was on the pub crawl passed out outside a club (embarrassing I know) . When I woke up and opened my eyes I saw a woman in the distance walking by and it looked like she was laughing at me. I smiled and made a friendly hand gesture like the shaka sign, then went back to sleep. Next thing I know I felt a loud slap on my face. Woke me up from my drunken slumber and I was so shocked I had no idea what'd happened, until I noticed that same woman was walking away with her two bodyguard looking dudes. I was super pissed so I walked after them in the distance shouting at them to get their attention, and the other two dudes turned around and started coming towards me. I wasn't going to beat up these two dudes so there wasn't much I could do.\n\nOn the gender front it's totally true that women on average are treated significantly better in general, particularly if you're pretty. One example that stood out to me was in Puerto Escondido when I'd eat at this taco place and get the typical indifferent service, but when I went with a female friend the worker was a totally different person to her, asking her where she's from, telling her all these crazy stories about his life, and inviting her to go surfing with him.\n\nWhen I lived in Rome I was fairly invisible (I could probably pass for a local), but my blonde foreigner gf there at the time seemed to get approached practically every time she left the house. I don't even actually recall any instances of harassment, just \"you're so beautiful\", waiters offering marriage, etc. Once when we were checking out of a hotel the female worker just could not stop gushing about how beautiful she was and take her eyes off her, practically ignoring me while I was trying to pay the bill. She told me she went to a meetup and everyone was crowded around her trying to talk to her. She'd be in Facebook/Telegram groups and get DMs from random dudes. It was eye-opening to me seeing all the attention she got, and also eye-opening for her seeing how much less attention she got with me vs. alone or out with her female friend(s). She loves Italy and still lives there. I think one's experience of Italy and perception of the locals' friendliness will be totally different depending on their gender.\n\nThese kinds of things used to annoy me, but it's just reality and one has to accept it. As a man you have to take initiative and expose yourself to potential rejection if you want to meet people, because chances are no one will approach you. At the end of the day, no one owes you anything. It sucks in the sense that it makes life more difficult, but the beauty is that it forces you to develop this skill and evolve into a more confident person.\n\nI see a lot of comments from dudes talking about how they're hesitant to approach girls out of fear of being perceived as \"hitting on them\". Yes this is the reality at night clubs, but honestly I can't recall many issues of this happening to me in other settings. And even if it did, if a girl wants to act all weird about you striking up a conversation, then that's her problem. But in my experience, most people are actually polite, and if they're not then why would you want to waste time with them anyways.",

I was just 18 years old, and slept at a 29-year old's place. I noticed he was browsing Grindr, so I decided to bring up the topic of homosexuality and that I was gay as well. It ended up in quite an uncomfortable moment, for instance one time I woke up to him hovering over me and trying to kiss me, and another time he insisted I held his hands in the car as he drove me back from the city center. I had a boyfriend at home so this stuff made me very uncomfortable.\n\nThere was another case in India where I had a few hours to spend in a random city waiting for the next bus. A guy my age came up to me at the station and asked me what I was doing. I told him I wanted to find a place to get cash and to grab some dinner, and he told me he could show me around town for an hour or two. An hour later and we're standing along some small river in between people defecating, him insisting I have sex with him. I insist I have a girlfriend and that I am certainly not gay. A very uncomfortable situation. We walk back closer to the main city again, with me slightly angry at him, and we just say goodbye there. I still have him on Facebook.\n\nI meet a lot of people travelling and I usually don't feel the need to come out. This can be a bit uncomfortable, especially with locals in more homophobic places. For instance I befriended this guy making music in a park in Cairo, we added each other on Instagram and whatsapp and stayed in contact. Then last weekend I posted a story of me at pride, and he replies \"are you a \\*\\*\\*?\". I reply \"uh, yes. why?\". Luckily, he replies back \"Oh, okay. Good morning\". But I was a bit scared for how that'd go.\n\nOn the other hand, the queer and gay community is always such a nice and welcoming space. Adult friendships are so much easier among gay and queer people, I guess because life for a gay or queer person only really starts at 18 and later. You can go to a gay bar, go on a date with someone through Tinder or Grindr, and meet someone who actually lives there and is much more likely to speak English too. They show me around, and show me a bit of their life - I love that. For instance two months ago I was in Paraguay, and just within two hours of arriving a guy from Tinder invited me to this gigantic project-X style house party in Asuncion. But I can understand that for someone who is perhaps more femme the negatives of solo travel would probably outweigh the positives. I'm gay enough for other gays to see I'm gay, but straight people don't really think about it.",

I have to actively make an effort to talk and keep engaging with people or else it won't happen. Groups or other solo travelers don't tend to walk up a start a conversation with a solo guy lol. Luckily I've never had an issue though and always have a great time making new friends.",

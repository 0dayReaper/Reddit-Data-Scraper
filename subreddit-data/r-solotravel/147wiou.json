            "comment": "If you're interested in the communist-era history of East Berlin, Hohenschoenhausen Prison is a worthwhile stop on an itinerary. Similarly the Unterwelten Berlin tours are highly recommended - they have several different tours with different focuses, but they'll take you into abandoned U-Bahn tunnels that were formerly used as bomb shelters, as well as escape routes between East and West Berlin.",

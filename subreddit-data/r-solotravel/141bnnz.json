    "postText": "I am on month one of a seven month trip through SEAsia. The first month was technically a \u201cstudy abroad\u201d where my university offered two courses, lead by a professor from my university back in the States in Taiwan (dw, the rest is truly in SEAsia). The course kept me busy to check out new cafes and get my work done while also meeting local students. \n\nNow that the program is coming to an end, I am preparing to be solo. While I have no doubt that I won\u2019t meet other travelers, go to museums and sites, and keep generally busy, I want to make sure that I have things to do in my down time whether I\u2019m sitting at a cafe, riding a bus, or completing a Workaway in a remote area. \n\nI love reading, and have already read 6 books in the past 4 weeks. What other passion projects or skills can I work on in my free time?",

You could work on creating a travelogue or a photostory or a vlog of your time.\n\nYou can also consider learning a language on the go. Since you're in Taiwan, Chinese can be an obvious choice, and it has speakers in many parts of S E Asia as well.  \n\nI also like to dig out local music. I do it for my own consumption, but I know people who like to curate regional playlists based on their travels, and think that's pretty cool too.",

Reason is I've seen too many and every city has like ten+ temples I don't care anymore.\n\nSome of them will say visit this flower market or clothing market etc.. I generall avoid this because I've seen too many and don't wish to buy anything nor see a flower market, I'm no botanist. \n\nWhat I do like is:\n\nParks.\nSeaside walks.\nMalls.\nBoat cruises.\nCafe hopping. \nPeople watching in high traffic areas.\nGoing to places of natural beauty with views of hills and/or mountains etc.",

When I was around 21/22 (thanks covid) I was mainly looking forward to the night time and experiencing other music scenes apart from England (although my travelling was probably only a couple of months really). I'm not a hugely sociable person but I really like my music so would spend a lot of time watching Youtube tutorials for Ableton and DJing in my downtime, along with attempting to learn the language of the countries I was in (French and German). I'd then awkwardly try to use the phrases at clubs and gigs so put into practice quite quickly. At least I know how to buy a beer and find where the toilet is lol. Not sure how much this will help but it's my experience, I guess lol.  \n\n\nApart from that, I taught myself the Rubiks Cube, learnt some coding, tested myself on world capitals/flags &amp; did lots of Duolingo",

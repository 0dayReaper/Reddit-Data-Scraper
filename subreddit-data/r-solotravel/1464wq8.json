    "postText": "Hello all! \n\nIn the spur of the moment, I decided that I\u2019d like to go to Europe on a 16-18 day solo trip\u2026 leaving in 10 days. (I know, this is foolish and I\u2019ll have to pay so much more but for many reasons I need this trip). Budget is around $7,500 CDN, could increase if needed. \n\nI\u2019d be VERY grateful for any advice, tips, and just general comments. Thank you so much in advance! The itinerary is VERY rough and I\u2019d be willing to change anything and everything. As I\u2019m very new to this, I apologize in advance if the below is unreasonable, that is why I am asking for help! Thank you so much in advance. \n\nDay 1 Canada - Paris \n\nDay 2-4 Paris (any suggestions for things to do). \n\nDay 4-6 Marseille \n\nDay 6-9 Nice and the French Riviera (how best to visit/travel based in Nice) \n\nDay 9-11 Florence\n\nDay 11-14 Rome \n\n14-17 Naples and Amalfi Coast (any suggestions here?) \n\nDay 18- back to Rome to fly back to Canada.",

Forget what you \u2018should\u2019 do or any \u2018you\u2019re not a real traveller if you don\u2019t\u2026\u2019 advice. Instead, focus on how you\u2019re enjoying yourself and where you want to place your priorities. So many questions here are talking about packed itineraries (or not), making friends (or not), what to see (or not). Use this to find you and your style of solo travel. It will make you a much happier traveller in the long term.",

            "comment": "Don't try to bite off more than you can chew. :)\n\nFrance and Italy are packed to the rafters with things to see and do - even their individual cities. You could hop, skip, and jump all over the place but that'll only leave you tired and overwhelmed (trust me, even seeing the highlights requires a lot of time and energy), apart from making you spend half your trip on trains and planes and buses instead of on the ground (not to mention the costs involved).\n\nMy advice would be to cull down your wishlist and give each place atleast a little more time. Just allotting Days 2-4 for Paris, for instance, are criminally short - the museums alone take a day, as does a day trip out to Versailles. When will you find time to do the city itself - look at Eiffel Tower from Tracadero, stroll down Champs Elysees and Montmartre, eat and drink in the Latin Quarter etc (and I'm only talking about the clich\u00e9d spots - Paris snobs will list atleast a hundred other authentic experiences that are totally worthwhile).\n\nI understand that travelling to Europe isn't easy for most of us, but being in Canada, you've got it simpler than a lot of us (not complaining, but just adding perspective). Use that to your advantage and foresee more and slower trips to Europe. :)\n\nIn that vein, my foremost advice for you would be to do just Italy or France. Keep in mind that 18 days isn't enough to cover all the wonderful highlights of both countries, but it will allow you to see enough to make you feel like you really discovered the place. In general (before anyone jumps on me, I emphasize that I am generalising based on my reactions to the place), France can feel a little more formal and uptight, while Italy has a more laidback vibe to it. France will be colder on average, while Italy could get very warm in the peak summer. My personal preference is for Italy as I enjoy its variety of landscapes, its food, and the sheer history more than what France offers.\n\nAs far as your rough itinerary is concerned:\n\nParis needs more time, as explained above. I'd say 1 day for the museums, 2 days for rapid sightseeing, and 1-2 days for day trips (Versailles, Mont St Michel, Giverny, Fontainbleu...)\n\nMarseille is skippable. I'd rather stop off at Avignon or Aix-en-Provence to be able to see the history and the countryside (lavender fields are here too) OR the Burgundy region for wine OR Chamonix for the alps.\n\nNice and Cote d'Azur are frightfully expensive, and can thus feel overrated. Nevertheless, there are some pretty and under-the-radar spots here if you drive or use public transport a little more aimlessly than most. Eze is a beautiful village worth checking out.\n\nFlorence needs more time as well. While you can see much of the city in a very fast-paced day, you need more time to discover the rest of Tuscany. Consider staying at an agriturismo (a farmstay, a quintessential experience in these parts and not that expensive as well), visiting hill towns (Montepulciano and San Gimignano are beautiful, but there's countless over here), and considering a daytrip out to Siena or Pisa.\n\nRome also needs more time. Vatican alone will take a day, and the rest of the roman sights need two days atleast. You'll run the risk of sunstrokes if you spend too much time out in the sun sightseeing - the southern European summers shouldn't be underestimated (and I'm an Indian guy here).\n\nNaples is lovely! Lots of character even if its not a conventionally pretty place, the ruins of Pompeii are quite something, and Amalfi Coast is dreamy. That said, Amalfi is crazy expensive in the season, and the crowds are a huge turn off - unless you stay overnight at Positano for instance (and spend through your nose doing it), you'll never get a quiet moment here when the day tour crowds are milling. Either anticipate that, or look up an alternative - I'd suggest the Cinque Terre, which is closer to Florence, has a similar landscape, and feels a lot more authentic.",

Atleast in Paris you have the option of hedging costs by staying a little further away and using public transport. That isn\u2019t really as viable an option in Nice and C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, and hence the costs add up overall.",

French Riviera can be visited by train although I have a passion for road trips and would take a car and visit at my own pace. In general though you are going to two major city destinations and spending basically only 1 full day in Paris and Rome is a pity. Maybe remove Naples or Marseille? (Also depends if youre French Canadian and maybe would enjoy more one or the other\u2026but I\u2019m Italian so would cut Marseille, fuck those guys \ud83d\ude05)",

I'd recommend cutting the Naples leg and dividing the extra time between Florence and Rome. It's nice to get a better feel for a couple places vs spending so much time in transit. Especially at the end of the trip. Honestly, I've never been to that part of Italy so maybe I'm being silly and feel free to disregard. :)",

I suggest skipping Marseille and giving its days to Paris.\n\nRome needs more time. (Your last day doesn't count since you're leaving.) Maybe take out a day from Nice and Naples.\n\nI don't know how hot it is now in Europe, but the heat can make you feel lethargic and tired, plus the crowds have now started to descend upon the tourist spots. Be aware of this and plan accordingly. Drink a ton of water and pack a few electrolyte drinks (un-sponsored recommendation: Liquid IV).",

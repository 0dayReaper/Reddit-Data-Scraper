    "postText": " \n\nHey everyone,\n\nI'm planning a trip to Spain this summer and I want to fully experience the country without breaking the bank. My budget is 1000 euros for a week, and I'm hoping to find some cheap destinations and hacks to make the most of my trip.\n\nI'm looking for suggestions on the best places to stay, eat, and visit that won't cost a fortune. I'm interested in cultural experiences, local food, and beautiful sights.\n\nSome specific questions I have are:\n\n* Are there any affordable accommodations that you recommend, such as hostels or budget hotels?\n* What are some cheap destinations that offer a unique Spanish experience?\n* What are some hacks for saving money on food and drinks while still enjoying local cuisine?\n* Are there any free or low-cost activities that you recommend?\n\nAny advice, tips, or personal experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help!",

The most expensive will be the accommodation, everything else in Spain is very affordable, especially in the South. In Granada you get a free Tapa in many places when you order a drink. \n\nCheapest are hostels always, you can also find decent Airbnb's but in general the prices for rooms are pretty high since Spain is a highly visited destination.",

The airport is pretty well connected to the city center. You can visit the old capital Toledo under an hour by a high speed train. Also there are quite a few free things to do in Madrid, and it\u2019s rather varied as well.\n\nSpain is extremely varied from north to south and I have no idea what really counts as a traditional experience, sorry. But basically if you like super early Spanish history (moors), visit the Andalucia region. If you are interested in the history of the monarchy, visit Madrid. If you like neither and you like architecture, Barcelona does it best.",

You can do gorgeous hikes for free and surf at the beaches here for affordable prices. Also check out San Sebastian in the Basque region. I don't know hostels in particular but there are plenty of good ones. I don't know if you speak Spanish or not but Asturias may be tricky to navigate without knowing some Spanish.\n\nA lot of bars in the north of Spain offer pinchos (also spelled pinxos) that are little sandwiches that sometimes come free with a drink order, and if not they cost 1 or 2 Euros. Spain also has the \"men\u00fa del d\u00eda\" at restaurants where you get a drink of choice, usually two dishes, and a dessert for 12-15 Euros for lunch (which is usually between 2-4 pm).\n\nIf you're interested, check out my blog on my life in Asturias this year: www.amandainspain.com",

            "comment": "Hey! Does that budget include everything? Hotels/tours/food/etc?\nIf it does, I think you can definitely do it but it will depend on the cities you visit and where you stay. If you've never been to Spain before, I'd recommend a couple of days in Barcelona or Madrid. I like Madrid better, but it gets too hot in the summer, and Barcelona has nice beaches very close to the city and accesible through cheap trains.\nThe North of Spain has great views as well - Bilbao, San Sebasti\u00e1n, etc. \n\nTo get around the country, you can find cheap flights if booking some months/weeks ahead, but you can also look at Alsa buses, or at trains. Renfe is the main train company but it can be expensive. They have their own \"low cost\" train called AVLO but there are a couple of newer low cost train companies that work great too like Ouigo and Iryo (I've taken all of these last year and all worked great). You can compare prices and routes using the Omio website.\n\nThe food in Spain is the best and it can be cheap as well. All throughout Spain you'll find that many restaurants have a daily fixed menu (\"Men\u00fa del d\u00eda\") for a set price that could be from 10 to 15 euros depending on the city. In these menus you can choose 1 appetizer, a main course and a dessert with 3 or 4 choices of dishes in each category and normally include a beverage. Men\u00fa options are usually listed on a chalkboard near the front of the restaurant or told to you table-side. These can be found in touristic places but also where locals eat, so it's always a good option to eat typical food for a small price.\nIf you have a kitchen in your accommodation, supermarkets are useful too since they have a lot of ready to eat dishes and their quality is incredible (you can look for Mercadona or Lidl).",

I get the supply/demand issue bc closed hostels to pandemic and now people are back in full swing with a smaller number of available hostels. It stings tho paying all time high prices. It does bewilder me how some of the younger folk can afford travel these days as I can barely manage at these prices",

            "comment": "Accommodations is going to eat up the biggest part of your budget, specially in the middle of summer. Either hostels downtown or try hotels outside the city centre as long as there\u2019s an easy transport option. Just did a quick search on hostel world and a night downtown Madrid is 20-40\u20ac in a shared dormitory, in July, so not too bad. 15-25\u20ac in Granada. So overall not too pricey. Trains can be a expensive (AVE -fast train- Madrid-Seville is usually around 80\u20ac, although there are new low cost options). Buses (look for Alsa) are usually cheaper. Food is usually inexpensive, just avoid touristy areas (rule of thumb, avoid any places with pictures on the menu). In Andaluc\u00eda you almost always get a tapa (small dish) with every drink, so 2-3 beers and you\u2019ve had a small meal.",

Accommodation might be more expensive in the summer but your budget should be completely ok. I only ate out properly once but I had beers/coffees/tapas daily, I visited several paid attractions, and I bought a few souvenirs. If you stick to hostels, travel from place to place by bus and don't splurge on private tours etc you'll be totally fine.",

In Barcelona, Granada city, mountain villages near Granada\\~, and Madrid.\n\n1. **Food** \\- Realize the \"men\u00fa del d\u00eda\" is really value for money! And really filling! So if you have a late lunch, you can kind of save for dinner too. The bad thing was that it is something you can't really Google Map for. So it's usually walking past the shops, seeing the signage outside, and walk in. I think it's usually for weekdays only too.\n2. **Walking in Cities** (Madrid, Barcelona) - walking tours! Realize we also walk a lot by ourselves and the places of interests are quite near to each other (esp. Barcelona), so don't need to get those public transportation cards with \"unlimited travel\" for x days.\n3. **Entrance tickets in Cities** (Madrid, Barcelona) is also where we spent the most! The entrance tickets can really add up! And within each attraction, the tickets also range from free unguided tour to full access audio tour. So would be good to research more to see the appropriate ticket tier for you :)",

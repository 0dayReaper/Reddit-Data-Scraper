            "comment": "I'm one month into a four month road trip. So far I've drivin 4837 miles starting from my home in Minnesota. Today I spent my birthday checking out 17 mile drive in Pacific Grove, CA. I hadn't done much research on it and it really blew my mind. In particular I loved Spanish Bay, which is where this picture is from. I walked all the way down the boardwalk (and had a deer cross the path right in front of me!) and then back down the beach with my toes in the water. I also treated myself to a fancy seaside dinner of clam chowder, lobster risotto, and chocolate mousse. Now I'm laying in my sleeping bag in my hammock high as a kite. Life is good today.",

Carmel CA, a neighboring down is also delightful. Lots of quaint shops and restaurants, a gorgeous beach and just a generally beautiful place. I recommend checking it out if you have the time. Also happy birthday! ",

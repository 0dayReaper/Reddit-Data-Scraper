    "postText": "Hey fellow travelers! I\u2019ve been working on a list of essential items that solo travelers should have with them anytime they travel. Quick background on me, I\u2019ve been solo traveling for just over 3 years and lately I\u2019ve been trying to get more friends to join me on my adventures and the same question comes up: What should I pack?\n\nThis is a working list I\u2019ve come up with: \n\nMicrofiber Towel- lightweight and quick drying \n\nPortable Charger- always smart to have a backup battery \n\nSunglasses- a good pair of sunglasses will save your beautiful eyes from pain \n\nCompressible Daypack- for those days where go for a hike or beach day \n\nDurable shoes- Lightweight and comfortable shoes go a long way\n\nBoard game/cards- I bring the party pack edition of exploding kittens, I\u2019ve found it to be a great icebreaker and the game is awesome \n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I missing anything that\u2019s essential but isn\u2019t immediately obvious to those who want to start solo traveling?\n\nEdit: The responses have been overwhelmingly fantastic, thank you solotravel community! I'll be beefing up my travel checklist now.",

Diff, SIBO, or something else gnarly.\n\nDef gotta take the probiotics daily and build your gut up versus taking them as a one-off. Not to mention the inconvenience and immersion-breaking of being super anal about food preparation safety, eating no vegetables, not having any mixed drinks with ice, etc. Easier to do in an all-inclusive resort, harder to do in an area where locals actually live.",

I think this might be more suitable for the longterm backpacker subreddit where you interact with others more readily and actively look to meet more people on the travel itself.\n\n**I'm going to add in**:\n\n\\- [**Reusable utensils**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09G3FMY6V/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). Got that yogurt at a small shop? Got a lunch to go and are already in transit? Gotta have something to eat them with to look civilized! Having at the very least a reusable fork on your person will lessen the struggle.\n\n\\- **Nail clipper** and/or **small curved scissors** that can pass TSA. Snagged nails, stuff you need to cut to alter or set free, etc. has popped up on most of my trips and most folks tend to forget to pack these.\n\n\\- [**Whistle**](https://www.amazon.com/TTSAM-Multifunctional-Emergency-Survival-Thermometer/dp/B01FLMF7OA/ref=sr_1_16?crid=JKX9J8QHB5R0&amp;keywords=whistle+with+compass&amp;qid=1683426880&amp;sprefix=whistle+with+compas%2Caps%2C214&amp;sr=8-16) (I hike a lot). It's just good to have it to draw attention to yourself or scare most animals away. Bonus points if it also has a compass attached to it.\n\n\\- Well stocked **First Aid Kit**. Make sure you have things like plenty of band aids, rubber bands, an [emergency blanket](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Die-Woods-Toughest-Emergency/dp/B07KL874F4/ref=sr_1_6?crid=114TPTVDGKMHU&amp;keywords=hiking+blanket&amp;qid=1683426569&amp;sprefix=hiking+blank%2Caps%2C289&amp;sr=8-6) (these are super tiny but worth their weight in gold should the need arise if you forget your sweater and/or end up sleeping out in the open or in the back seat of your rental for whatever reason). Don't just carry around that same kit from 5-years ago that has one dried out sanitizer wipe in it and no band aids.\n\n\\- **Sanitizer.** This should be a staple in everyone's kit but I find most folks don't carry it for whatever reason.\n\n\\- [**Flushable (and biodegradable) \\[ass\\] wipes**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087NN5QGM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)**.** Cottonelle makes eco-friendly wipes and these are also worth their weight in gold. **&lt;-- ETA: I specifically made note of \"biodegradable\" and used Cottonelles as a suggested link even stating they're eco-friendly because they make flushable wipes that breakdown like toilet paper. STOP commenting and/or personal messaging me telling me I'm destroying the sewer system and septic tanks when your information is outdated FFS. Do a little research.**\n\n\\- [**Tissues**](https://www.amazon.com/Vinda-3-Ply-Pocket-Tissues-Travel/dp/B09WDGKKNS/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2F43M1E4C4VTH&amp;keywords=tissues+on+the+go&amp;qid=1683427038&amp;sprefix=tissues+on+the+go%2Caps%2C101&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE3VFRKUUdRMDVHUDgmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAxNjQ1ODEzSzBZQlFaT1EwU1FMJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA3NDY2MDc0MEJNSUc0WFY0R0wmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl)**.** You're crying. Someone else is crying. You sneezed on the train and now your nose is leaking. You ate and now your fingers are filthy, etc. This is a staple in my cross-body bag. You can use toilet paper, store tissues/napkins/etc., but the presentation is much better with the portable ones that are well packaged and less chance of forgetting if they're already sitting pretty in your main bag.\n\n\\- [**Headlight**](https://www.amazon.com/Energizer-Flashlight-Two-Handed-Activities-Emergencies/dp/B092RHC2FY/ref=sr_1_6?crid=3PCOGFPHXKW5J&amp;keywords=headlight&amp;qid=1683427214&amp;sprefix=headlight%2Caps%2C109&amp;sr=8-6)**.** Again, I hike a lot and this is a staple in my kit but honestly this can come in handy anywhere at night to free your hands and not rely on your phone for light if your battery is low, etc. as you're rummaging through your bag, going through a forest, etc.\n\n\\- **Portable charger.** Seconding THIS as this should be a staple in everyone's kit. No exceptions/excuses! Get one that is heavy duty and can do like 10 charges before recharging. Like it or not -- our phones contain most of the travel juice in the modern age (it's our camera, our navigator, our wallet, our organizer (tickets/itinerary), phone, etc.). Treat it well. With a portable charger, you can obviously charge on the go. Too many times I've seen folks just posted up at train stations/Starbucks, etc. waiting for their phones to charge before they can move onwards... and they got lucky that they had it somewhere to charge. Don't do yourself like this.\n\n\\- For those that rent cars: **Car Phone Holder Mount**. Get the one that can be mounted to the AC vents and not the one that is stick-on only. Sure beats paying for this addition and/or putting the phone in an inconvenient spot and having it fall/slide/etc. and further distract you.\n\n\\- **Regular plastic bags**. Yeah, they're a bitch to rummage through if you checked in at 2AM and are sharing a room with seven other people but hear me out. Any excess shit you collected and need to lug around with you? Plastic bag. Your socks/clothes got wet and you don't want to stash them with the dry stuff? Plastic bag. You shit/pissed yourself but don't want to toss your undergarments/pants? Plastic bag. You're in a country that puts groceries in a paper bag but it shredded half a day in? Plastic bag. ... and so on. Yes, ziplock bags are highly recommended but regular superstore plastic bags will do better for the larger stuff as it's less guilt tossing it into the recycling bin after its use is done.\n\n\\- [**Mosquito repellant**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0725YN6FP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). I got schooled hiking in Denali National Park (Alaska) as I wasn't expecting to be bitten by over 200 mosquitos there in a span of 2 hours. I lost count of how many I killed as well but holy shit was the experience unpleasant considering that I was prepared for bears but thought there wouldn't be mosquitos fucking with people  in that part of our Earth. They even got me through my shirt and athletic leggings so... carry a small repellant balm at the very least as you never know where these assholes might spring up on your future travels if you only expected to see their asses in the tropics and deep summertime.\n\n\\- **Umbrella**. This one should be a no brainer but too many people end up forgetting it at home. Get a small, compact one and you should be set. Also, to share a tip should you  not have an umbrella/rain coat with you and you're about to be caught in a rain storm with no shelter or are running towards shelter (you know the cloud I'm talking about -- it moved in quick and it's turned the sky all black and shit): quickly change out of your sneakers into flip flops or go barefoot if you have to. You're better off drying just your feet than waiting for your sneakers/boots to dry after the fact. Good luck if it's below 30F.\n\n**ETA: Learn the difference between need and want. The word** ***essential*** **speaks for itself but many of you are just wilin' out. People are literally arguing that they didn't need umbrellas, portable chargers, and small flashlights on their vacations so they're not essential. GTFO! I didn't need my ID on some vacations I took but that didn't mean it was left behind. Essential generally implies having these items on hand as necessary \"in case shit\" so it prevents inconvenience, loss of money and/or life. Playing cards? How many people even know how to play cards? Yet -- all of us experience the night. Even Sahara Desert experiences rain at certain times of the year (and if you're in transit, maybe it didn't rain in places like Oman when you were there but there's a downpour waiting for you back home on the day you return), and many, many, many of us use our phones and kill a charge quickly and it needs a recharging during the day. I swear... I have to remind myself this is an open forum for like two million people and anyone can post whatever they want regardless of how inane it sounds.**",

Not sure why folks are fighting tooth and nail to shit on flashlights when they're literally part of an essential survival kit.\n\nExamples: Flashlights help when:\n\n\\- at night you're walking down a poorly lit street and can barely see in front you but your phone is at 2% battery and you don't wanna drain it more.\n\n\\- your hike took too long and you're still in the forest at nighttime trying to get back to your car/tent/cabin/hotel.\n\n\\- light goes out in your $8/night hostel for whatever reason and you need to move around in the dark.\n\n\\- your rental car tire blew out and it's 11PM and you have no cell service but you do have a spare in the trunk you can change yourself.\n\n\\- you need to flash the international SOS signal.\n\n\\- you dropped something in the grass in the night and need to find it before daybreak.\n\n... and a plethora of other uses. I mean, headlights are generally lightweight and free up both hands and your phone (for those dependent on the flashlight on the phone); plus, the beam is usually stronger than then ones that the phone provides.\n\nFurthermore, many headlamps have reflectors on them so if you're walking at night, it comes in handy to warn other drivers you're there and for them to try to be more cautious of your presence. It's definitely a more of a hiking staple but it's damn worth it to have if you're in a tight spot at night outside of the deep cityscape as it frees up your hands and it's stronger than the cellphone flashlight. Obviously, in the middle of Berlin it's most often useless but I've used mine way too many times on my travels (which are like 70% parks/forests and 30% cityscapes).",

It\u2019s more like going to the driest part of the Sahara for vacation and finding sunglasses a more useful essential item than an umbrella. \n\nThis is a really weird hill you\u2019ve picked to die on, like I\u2019m calling a pack of cards essential to human survival instead of commenting on a thread about what frequent travelers find essential to their enjoyment of a vacation. \n\nIn case it was somehow unclear to anyone else other than this terminally online alarmist, no I don\u2019t think a pack of cards is more essential than a flashlight if you are Bear Grylls.",

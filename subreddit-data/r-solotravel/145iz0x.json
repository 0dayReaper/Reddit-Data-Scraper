    "postText": "I decided to book a trip to Europe on a whim and my budget is $10k in Canadian dollars. I plan to go in the last two weeks of July because I will most likely start a new job in August. But I haven't booked any flights or hotels yet. I'm a POC woman if that helps. This is my itinerary as follows: \n\n\\--Day 1-3:--\n\n* Take a flight from Canada to Barcelona El Prat Airport and stay at a hotel. \n* Walk around and visit major tourist attractions such as Casa Batllo, Picasso Museum, History Museum. \n* Should I purchase a Barcelona City Pass? \n\n\\--Day 4-7:--\n\n* Fly from Barcelona El Prat Airport to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport and check into a hotel/hostel/AirBnb\n* Visit major tourist attractions e.g. Eiffel Tower, Catacombs, etc. Should I get a city pass for Paris? \n\n\\--Day 8-14:--\n\n* Take a flight to Rome Fiumicino or Leonardo da Vinci and again check into a hotel/hostel/AirBnB.\n* Hop from Rome --&gt; Florence --&gt; Pisa --&gt; Venice by train.  \n\n\\--Day 14:--\n\n* Fly back to Canada from Venice or I might go to London first and then take a direct flight to Canada.  \n\nAny thoughts? I know this is a very last minute decision but I will not be able to take time off like this again, so I want to make the most out of it.",

Just go and sit someplace in Spain at least Barcelona maybe another city at tops and just smell the coffee and the roses. Walk around take your time go do museums, go have dinner go sit in the cafe. You don't want to be spending your time in airport, a railroad station running running running finding new places. I know it's tempting because you want to see so much but as a season traveler but more than 60 years, I learned my lesson many many decades ago. The old film it's Tuesday it must be Belgium here applies. Slow down much less is actually much much more. Think about it and your time of going unfortunately is not the best but if that's all you have that's all you have.. September the last half or October especially to Spain, Portugal France much much nicer",

Paris is a great place to be in the summer, but Rome is a horrible place to be in the summer - at least in comparison to how gorgeous and amazing it is in the spring. If it were me, I would spend roughly a week, or at least five days in Paris, and stay in that part of Europe. If you insist on staying in big cities, go to London and Amsterdam. There are also amazing, amazing towns near Paris that you would also love such as a Lille Reims and Strasbourg which are very accessible for a day or two.\n\nRome is a totally different kind of place, and while it\u2019s very charming It\u2019s not as much of a modern city as Paris or London or Toronto. The metro doesn\u2019t work very well, and it doesn\u2019t cover very much. The tourist infrastructure is not very developed, and there are swarms of tourists, which kind of ruin the city in my opinion. It\u2019s also extremely, extremely, uncomfortably hot in the summer. Again, Rome is one of my favorite cities in the world but you should go after January, and before Easter that timeframe is ideal to avoid the tourists and the heat.",

The year before in Rome for two and a half weeks and I never get bored. It's not a matter of running around sightseeing everyday to coliseum the ruins the churches etc. But just sitting and relaxing. Enjoying the street enjoying the culture.\n\n But I know that's not for everybody for that period of time. But be easy on yourself. You really don't have a lot of time, with flights, connections etc. Running around to do all the stuff is going to exhaust you and consume all of your time.\n\n Pick a geographical area and go and sit for a while and just relax. Morning you the sites have a nice big lunch and relax. This is more my style that I advocate... A few days are always completely unplanned and I let whatever flop into my lap It's something always does more fascinating than I could have predicted. Something around the corner, an event.\n\nThe big cities however are hot, and this is the worst time to travel to Europe. Everybody else is on vacation. Everybody that's in those places is on vacation etc and it can be miserable. Better if you must do that then, pick smaller cities, once again a regional decision, and stick to it Southern Spain perhaps, Loire valley France perhaps. I know it sounds like you have a lot of time and you want to whirlwind of activity but it will just be that. You'll be running to catch the train the bus or the plane..\n\nIt's tough to edit yourself when you're spending the money and you want to go and you want to see it all. I know I've learned the hard ways , 50 plus years ago. Good look at it though and have a nice trip whatever you do but I hope you be consider some of my advice for your sanity and experience,",

Then again you are not European so won\u2019t have the change to go there anytime easy like we do, so if you want to do it you should: just be aware what you are getting into.

            "comment": "I'd advise 'fewer places, more time'. In your current plan, you're basically spending just one full and clear day of sightseeing in each city you intend to visit, and every alternate day on a flight, train, or a bus. That's going to be fairly tiring and expensive, and won't leave you with enough time to see even the major highlights of every city. Further, August can get mighty hot in these places and you'll probably risk getting a sun- or a heat-stroke if you're out the whole day in Barcelona and Rome.\n\nI'd strongly suggest you to stick to no more than 3 cities in two weeks. This will not only give you enough time to sightsee without burning out, but also help you throw in a nice day-trip from each, help you to access longer-stay discounts at accommodation, and spend less money on flights, trains and hotels. If you can get past the urge to cover more countries, you should strongly consider sticking to just one or at most two countries in the timeframe.\n\nI understand that many travellers on this sub feel they don't get to travel too often to Europe and that they'd rather cover as much ground as they can, but it's honestly not the nicest way to experience the place, especially while battling peak summer travel crowds. Moreover, you have a Canadian passport, which allows you to access the Schengen area with relatively little planning - that's an incredible privilege that you should really think of using over a longer term, and not compound into a single visit alone.\n\nIn that vein, I'd suggest you to focus on just one out of Italy, Spain, and France. All three score very highly on history, art, culture, landscape, food, and two weeks will feel like very little time in each once you get down to planning an itinerary more robustly. Alternatively, you could just stick to the big three - Barcelona, Paris, and Rome - and get a taste of how different European cities can be from each other. \n\nAs far as being a POC woman goes, I don't anticipate many issues. There may be some instances of casual racism here or there, but they'll be the exception rather than the norm. Women's safety is also generally high, BUT Italian and Spanish men can be a little loose with their 'appreciation'. As anywhere, just keep your wits about you especially if you're out drinking or walking about after dark - Europe is very safe, but not foolproof. Also, pickpocketing is an issue at major tourist attractions, so don't walk around with your wallet or camera or phone or bag in an easy-to-snatch position.\n\nAs for city passes, I'm NOT a fan. Many times, the attractions they offer discounted entry on are second tier ones. Even in terms of getting around, the tour buses are restrictive as they operate on a sparse schedule and cost a lot. You can do your sightseeing for a lot less by booking tickets individually online (at the A-list spots, mind you), and using public transport (excellent everywhere in Europe, and easily navigable using Google Maps).",

Once I have money in the account I can move as much or as little into another currency. Then if I have to pay for anything (off to Sicily next week, just been charged in Euros for accommodation) there are no extra money change fees. \n\nThere is an exchange rate and a fee but both are far more favourable than any others I've ever encountered. It also means that if I withdraw at an ATM I don't get charged any sneaky fees because I'm withdrawing from a local currency account. I just need to make sure I'm using a free to use ATM. \n\nI use my phone to manage the account and get an alert every time I use it.

Definitely cut down two of the Italian cities, you won't have time to do 4 without feeling exhausted.",

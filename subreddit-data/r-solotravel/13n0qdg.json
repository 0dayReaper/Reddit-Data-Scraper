    "postText": "I posted this to the Kyrgyzstan sub yesterday but just saw the Uzbekistan post (where I also spent 8 days and also wrote my own report but I think the other one was pretty comprehensive so won't repost mine here) and thought perhaps you would appreciate it. For reference, I'm 32M travelling on a European passport - so no need for visas or anything.\n\n**Arriving**\n\nI flew into Bishkek from Tashkent on Uzbekistan Airways - the flight was fine, only one hour, equivalent to EasyJet or very short haul trips on AirFrance or the like in Europe. I'd already flown on UA and this flight was a bit underwhelming compared to the first one which was the best service I have ever had on a flight, but still, for a one hour flight, it was fine. Bishkek airport arrivals hall was very... quaint. Not in a bad way at all, it was brilliantly efficient, baggage came out quickly and when I came out with my bag I planned on getting some cash out of the ATM and buying a SIM card before heading out of the airport to order a Yandex. A note regarding Yandex - if you are using a European iPhone, you will not be able to download the Yandex app. Search instead for Yango. It is the same service repackaged for European customers. I expect it would work for Americans too. I used Yango but will refer to it as Yandex here as that's what it is referred to locally.\n\nAs with most airports, I was set upon by a couple of taxi drivers asking if I needed a ride. I said no, one was slightly persistent but I eventually told him I had no money and he left me alone. I tried to get cash out of an ATM but none of the machines in the airport worked with my European card. A security guard pointed to the ATM that was supposed to work for European cards but it didn't work either. No problem - I decided to buy a SIM card and pay by card, I could then order a Yandex outside and figure out the cash situation when I got into the city. The airport was a lot further from the city than I was expecting (because I was too stupid to check that beforehand) but the Yandex only cost \u20ac6 for a one hour trip so I ordered that and headed into Bishkek.\n\n**Bishkek**\n\nKyrgyzstan was the last stop on a longer trip so I decided that I wanted to have a fixed base. I expected to be pretty exhausted by the time I got there (I'm no spring chicken). The hostel I booked was beautiful and very good value for money. The evening I arrived I just had to get cash out, went for some laghman and then settled down for the night. The next day I woke up nice and early and took the day to explore the city and try to organise a few things for the rest of the week. I found Bishkek to be an absolutely fascinating city - I could have walked around it for days on end. I spoke to a few Kyrgyz people who seemed to show some shame about all the remnants of the Soviet past that you can find. Personally, as a tourist, I found this amazing to see. I had already travelled around 3 other former Soviet countries and a lot of that history seemed to already have been wiped away. That's their prerogative and I get it. But to see old Soviet statues, symbols and slogans was really interesting for me and I think a lot of people would appreciate the opportunity to see that part of history which is mostly lost - Bishkek seemed to be like a living museum. I walked around all of the centre of the city, went out to Osh Bazar and finally booked a trip for the next day to Ala-Archa.\n\n**Ala-Archa**\n\nI only spent half a day in Ala-Archa - I would have liked to have taken a longer trip and to have had the opportunity to go further into the park but as I was alone, I wanted to take an organised trip and so this was my only option on such short notice. It was a great trip though - the price of the guided tour was a lot less than I would have paid just for the transport there on my own. The landscapes were beautiful and put me in mind of Switzerland. And it's all a short taxi/bus ride from the city. You can literally see the mountains surrounding Bishkek whenever you walk in the street. If you're in Bishkek, it is a no-brainer to go out to Ala-Archa.\n\n**Issyk-Kul**\n\nAgain, another place I wish I had more time to visit. Again I took a guided tour, this time starting very early in the morning and coming back to Bishkek late at night. It was about 4 hours from Bishkek to the north shore. We took a boat out into the middle (well not the middle, but out into the lake at least) and moored up for about half an hour. As the boat stopped, the whole lake was perfectly still and perfectly blue - it was gorgeous. With my Anglo-Saxon heritage, the water was calling me. I asked the guide if it would be ok to go for a swim and she assured me it was too cold. I explained that I swim in the sea in England and she wavered and said if I want to, then I can go for it. I got changed into some swimming shorts and jumped in. Now, it was the beginning of May, the air temperature was about 15 and the water must have been even colder. I could stay in it for about 10 minutes before I started to feel the cold going through to my bones and I decided to get out. I'm so glad I did go in though - it was beautiful. I really hope I can go back one summer when the temperature is better (both in and out of the water). The tour guide told me that it is busy in the summer with Kyrgyz and Russian tourists. She also said German tourists which astonished me - I know there are significant ethnically German populations in Central Asia, perhaps she was referring to them. Because Issyk-Kul is not easy to get to for a German tourist. We went to some thermal baths after which warmed me back up again - then we stopped at the roadside on the way back to the city for some shashlik (barbecued meat) and tea and I dreamt of being in my own car and being able to do this with more freedom.\n\n**Tours**\n\nSo I took three tours in total during the trip: the previously mentioned Ala-Archa and Issyk-Kul excursions and also a day trip to Almaty (I won't go into detail here as it's not Kyrgyzstan but crossing the border was fine - the border guards were slightly confused about whether French people were allowed through but after a quick search they decided I was free to go). I took all of these trips with a Kyrgyz company called Kettik. In terms of the tours themselves, they were all exceptional. The guides were all amazing and even though my Russian is poor (and I was the only person who wasn't a native Russian speaker on all three tours) they helped me and spoke to me in English if there was something I didn't quite understand. The one issue I had (at least at the beginning) was the system of booking their tours - it's VERY complicated for a non-Russian speaker. I just about managed with my A2 level Russian but I imagine somebody who doesn't even read cyrillic would have no way of booking their trips. And that would be a shame, because their tour guides are brilliant. All of the booking process was done via WhatsApp. I know that's pretty common in Kyrgyzstan but seemed a bit strange to me, but no matter. The payment was another thing though. I had to use these payment terminals you find in supermarkets which have no English option (only Russian and Kyrgyz) so I can imagine there is absolutely no way a non-Russian speaker would be able to pay for the tours. I had a few people recommend Kettik to me on Reddit because they \"speak English\". Yes, they do. But you can't book their tours unless you speak Russian (or have somebody do it for you I suppose). Nonetheless, I got there in the end and I'm very glad I did because it greatly enhanced my trip. As far as I could tell, English language tours don't really exist other than privately booking a personal guide. This was out of my budget and not what I really wanted to do anyway.\n\n**Prices**\n\nYeah, everything is very cheap. SIM card was about \u20ac4 for a week with more than enough data. A laghman dinner cost about \u20ac3 in a restaurant. Beer (which is easily available everywhere, more easily than in Uzbekistan for example) was about \u20ac0,80 for a glass bottle or you could get huge plastic bottles significantly cheaper. Somsa could be from \u20ac0,20-\u20ac0,30 so two or three of those usually did me for breakfast. Yandex taxis were never more than \u20ac2 anywhere in Bishkek. Buses were \u20ac0,11. Kalpaks (traditional Kyrgyz hat) could be from \u20ac2 and up for better quality.\n\n**Safety**\n\nIt's super safe - I never felt any stress or any threat. Coming from a big European city, that was the biggest treat. I found Central Asia in general to be the safest place I have ever travelled to.\n\n**People**\n\nI had been in Uzbekistan for a week before arriving in Kyrgyzstan, and I found the people in Uzbekistan to be amazingly friendly. By comparison, the Kyrgyz people seemed to be slightly more reserved - less likely to interact directly (unprovoked), but then absolutely wonderful when you did speak to them. Damn, I mean, everywhere on my trip, people were infinitely nicer than where I'm from so all of this was just a dream. I am a white European man so make of that what you will - I've been told that it's not so welcoming to Indian and Pakistani people for example but I didn't see that myself.\n\n**Shopping**\n\nBishkek (and Kyrgyzstan in general) is the first country I have ever been to that seems to hide its souvenir shops. In every other country I've been to, souvenir sellers are constantly trying to grab your attention to buy their shitty magnets or low-quality t-shirts. As a typical tourist, I wanted to buy these things. I thought Osh Bazar would be my best bet, as it's an enormous market place, but no. I managed to get some cheap kalpaks (five of them if you want to know the truth) and some nice felt wall-hangings, but I couldn't find those elusive fridge magnets (my dad has a collection so I had to get one). In the end I had to come to Reddit to ask for help - I got sent to the top floor of \u0426\u0423\u041c (a sort of department store in Bishkek) and lo and behold, there it all was. A treasure trove of cheap tourist tat that I was looking for. I find it bizarre that there isn't more of this available at street level near major sights but perhaps there just aren't that many tourists? Either way, my business idea is to set up a small stall selling all of this shit, just by Ala Too Square - I think I'd make a killing. Supermarkets are cheaper than Europe and USA obviously but some items are not too far off the European prices - seemed to generally be things imported from Russia. If you do your shopping at the bazar, you won't be paying a lot though.\n\n**Language**\n\nIt is definitely worth learning Russian. At least to be able to read the alphabet. If you know the names of places and you can phonetically read it out from Cyrillic, it will help you no end. Not a lot is written in the latin alphabet apart from some business names. The younger generation (from my experience, aged 25 and under) do speak English to some extent. Other than that, you're going to be very lucky to find anyone you can communicate with if you don't know Russian (or Kyrgyz). I spent 3 months doing an hour or so a day on Duolingo and while it was definitely not enough to have any meaningful conversations, it did mean I could read my way around town, order in restaurants, speak to taxi drivers and ask how much things cost (I have been told I have an aptitude for learning languages so take that with a pinch of salt).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI visited four countries on my trip and Kyrgyzstan is the one I am most desperate to go back to. I dream of finding an old 4x4 to rent and driving all around Issyk-Kul during the summer months. Maybe taking it out into another mountain range, swimming in some rivers... I love how undisturbed it is. I will hopefully be back next year - that's the plan I'm working towards anyway, but now I know more or less what to do, how to get around and how to get by, I'm much more comfortable about being more independent.\n\nTL:DR (because that was long) - Kyrgyzstan is the most stunning country I have ever been to",

It was a really nice mixture of organised activities and free time actually.\n\nThe trip to Almaty was about \u20ac19. Included the bus and trips to a few mountains around the city.

One Kyrgyz guy who worked for the UN was telling me about problems between Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan even fairly recently and yet now it seems perfectly fine. But he said it could restart at any time. I didn't really understand whether these were purely political conflicts or violent conflicts though. Obviously I know about the Kyrgyz-Tajik conflict last year but otherwise I'm not sure.",

I'd argue safer than European cities because of what you mentioned regarding scams, pickpockets etc. which I didn't experience at all out there. Perhaps because there are very few tourists or perhaps people are just more honest - I don't know. But personal safety is definitely not an issue out there.",

I stayed in Bishkek for a week because Kyrgyzstan is not so easy to travel around (rail travel barely exists compared to Uzbekistan where it's really modern and easy). Also, there are lots of places you can go to for a day trip from Bishkek so it works as a good base. \n\nKazakhstan is very modern in general - that was not the purpose of my trip so I didn't spend much time there. The landscapes were not as beautiful as Kyrgyzstan (in my opinion) and there wasn't the same history as Uzbekistan. Kazakhstan is also huge. Kyrgyzstan is tiny in comparison and in two weeks you could see most of the country. Likewise in Uzbekistan, two weeks would get you from Tashkent to Khiva and back comfortably, so most of the most interesting sites. \n\nBut yeah, Uzbekistan may be too hot in the end of May/June. I was there at the beginning of May and it was the perfect temperature. The sun was very strong in the middle of the day and I had to avoid being out at that time but I think in 8 days I only had to put on the air conditioning once or twice in the hotel. It felt like the perfect time of year to be there. Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in the middle of May were cooler but still good weather.",

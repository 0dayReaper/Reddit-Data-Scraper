I suppose I could work somewhere for a while and build up 5 weeks of PTO a year but it would be cool to be able to take more frequent and more extended trips all over the place.",

You take a 4-5 day STCW course and get Daywork for experience out of Fort Lauderdale/Palma/Mallorca/ anywhere there are boats. It's not glamorous work but it pays decent, you save easily, travel with the boat, it's very transient... I used to work 6 months to save and then leave to go travel for awhile. There's a few guides online that detail how to get in the industry but you don't NEED alot of courses or credentials, particularly if you're American",

KP is free to attend but requires a navy obligation post college and I believe you have to be under 26 to apply, it\u2019s like West Point but for the merchant marines. \n\nThere are a lot of ways to enter the maritime industry starting at the bottom without going to college but the money is significantly lower\n\nI LOVE my job and I\u2019ll easily make over 150k+ this year.

After all bills are paid each month, I can shuffle about 1k into savings and have about 1k to spend given my habits (i dont normally spend all that). Again, I've been where I'm at for years and moved into a decent paying job to support myself based off my needs and save to travel in my off time.\n\nEvery park and company is different. Checking out coolworks.com is a great place to start feeling out what may or may not suit your lifestyle, bills, etc. \n\nSome places are GREAT others are not. But a lot of places that provide housing and food are typically pretty reasonable. I think where I'm at for the folks who do have to pay, it's about $600 a month for all you can eat, 3 meals a day as well as housing, utilities, free laundry and wifi. It comes directly out of your paycheck. Of course, if for some reason we are very over staffed and you can't get the hours (average 40 hr work week), they charge less.\n\nAffordable living is the big perk, which makes it hard to compare our wages to the \"real world\" because they do tend to be less because living here costs less. My company has been raising wages yearly to become more competitive with actual wages outside of my park.\n\nSorry for being vague, I'm trying to stay within my comfort levels of sharing while trying to help.",

When I say \"travel nurse\" people often think I work on a cruise ship or do home health. Contracts allow nurses to work for an amount of time, save up money, and travel between contracts.\nA nurse takes a contract-usually 13 weeks- at a facility where they do the same duties as a permanent staff member but typically make much more than the staff (usually).\n\n\nTo become one you have to go to nursing school (2 years minimum in the US) and have a year (at minimum) of experience. \n\nA warning, tavel nursing pay is getting lower ATM because everyone did it during covid because the rates were so much higher than staff rates, thus making a bunch of nurses all compete for contracts. Nursing is also not for everyone and has a high rate of burn out.",

For example you could be a Med-Surg nurse but the positions on those are limited.. however if you are an ICU nurse there are not only more positions but they typically will allow you to look at Stepdown or Telemetry nursing positions as well.",

DevOps is in high demand atm, and I think it will be quite a bit more difficult for AI to crowd you out of that than software development.\n\nIf you can start out with an entry level role in operations or infrastructure support you'll start gain the background you need for DevOps.  These roles are often difficult and not remote friendly, but eventually you will climb out of them into design, architecture and planning gigs.  Learn a little sys admin, a little scripting, a bit of networking, and so on.\n\nYou can also come at DevOps from a coding background, but I firmly believe you'll be more marketable with an infrastructure focused background.

At my old airline, even the #1 most sr FA and pilot in the entire company couldn't always get the schedule they wanted cuz the flights available didn't always match up with their bidding parameters.

Whenever I have changed jobs, I have asked for as late a start date as possible - up to 3 months after I finished the previous job.\n3. When I was working, I integrated solo travel into my work trips.  For instance, if I was going to a location, I might figure out where I had to change planes to get there.  Then I'd get a multi-day layover in that location.  Often there was zero incremental flight cost.  I'd try to arrange the layovers to include a weekend.  So, cost of the trip was small (extra hotel days) and vacation usage was small (travel days counted as work time, plus got a weekend.)  Or if the work trip was somewhere interesting, I'd arrive early or leave late, and again, try to get one end of the trip to align with a weekend.  (A couple of times I was able to integrate family travel into work trips, which was also good, but the timing is harder.)\n\nMy job was as a manager in the tech industry, working for global companies and sometimes going to global conferences.  The last few years haven't be great for travel - with so much remote work, I wasn't able to integrate travel and work nearly as well.  \n\n\nOn the other hand, I was able to do some remote tech work -sometimes a week of working remotely just for fun. Downside is that travel was limited to places near my home office timezone.",

But for all of the others, they had a policy that they would pay up to the cost of what the \"normal\" travel would have been. So, I'd search for the normal travel (work only), screenshot that, and use that as part of my expense report (as well as submitting the actual receipts).  Most company policies is to let you expense the lesser of the two - your actual expenses, or what a work-only trip would have cost.\n\nI never did anything deceptive - always made it clear that I was booking personal with business.  And I didn't try to find particularly expensive \"normal\" ways - I wasn't doing anything dishonest. \n\nDepending on the company policy, I'd either book my ticket through the company travel website, or third party.  \n\n\nIt's really all about your company policy, and also making sure your manager is cool with it (all of my managers were fine, even at the company that screwed me - in that one, it was the people in charge of reimbursements that were the problem.)",

I only work in 11 states (I just started my\nCompany two years ago) but there are also the big corporate giants that are my competitors that do the same with thing: you can check out: Maxim, Soliant, Stepping Stones, Epic Staffing Group, AMN Healthcare (I forget the name of the actual brand that does the school part) but essentially there's a lot that do what I do \n\nI hope this helps :)",

Even 5 years ago it was difficult for people to mentally push through because you'll start out at $40-45k - but due to the shortage thats now around $50-60k.\n\nIts HARD at first because you cannot (usually) use student loans to go towards getting your license but if traveling and a weird schedule is what you really want and you don't *love* dealing with people... man, I really wish being a pilot was a more common and accessible career path.

Being a consultant you tend to work with the same clients for a specific industry.  As a result clients want to learn what their competitors are doing.  So they pay more more knowledge and additional research in new areas they are thinking of going into.\n\nAlso, you would be surprised how understaffed a lot of these companies are. They seem like they have their shit together, but they are relying on poor Joe who hasn\u2019t taken a vacation in 20 years to keep things flowing.  So these people while they are super knowledgeable, have no time to do any extra research or spend timing to improve existing processes in place.",

My sales job has allowed for a lot of travel. Both for work and leisure. I\u2019m currently planning a month long trip thru Europe. I know my quarterly quota will be hard to hit given I\u2019ll have 1/3 less runway, but hey you only live once and I have enough PTO saved so I\u2019ve earned it. I will say, any company offering unlimited PTO will be surprisingly hard to take long trips when working for. Accumulated PTO is yours to use how you see fit but unlimited PTO is supposed to be used with the business\u2019 best interests in mind so losing a sales person for 30 days would not be feasible, for instance.\n\nTeachers get summers off.",

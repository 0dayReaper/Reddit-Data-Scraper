Like I would say damn normally but that\u2019s deemed offensive in the US.\n\nAlso if there\u2019s anything else such as clothing that is deemed offensive or just anything really, please include it. I wanna be prepared!",

You'll be fine. There are loads of staff from the UK who get hired at the summer camps together, so you likely won't be the only one.

All the \"our slang is different\" talk will probably get out of the way in the first few days, and everyone will quickly get over it. \n\nHave a great time!",

Sales taxes are also added on top of the price, not included in the quoted price.\n* Candid talk about social class in the way that people in the UK do it is generally not done in the US, which likes to imagine itself a class-free society (though this is certainly not even remotely true). \n* The hard c-word is NOT okay in the US. \n* The very odd habit that people in the UK have of displaying the confederate flag is definitely a no-go in the US, as it's highly racist and offensive. (Has this finally fallen out of fashion in the UK? I hope so!) (ETA: Since so many people are reacting angrily and defensively to this, I presume it has in fact largely disappeared in the past 15 years from the UK, which I'm glad to see. You can all put your swords down now.)\n* The humour is different. British humour is drier overall. Americans don't often pick up on British irony. Be careful with wry or deadpan humour, as Americans may take it at face value.\n* Quoting your weight in stones will lead to confusion. Also, a pint of beer in the US is a measly 16oz, as opposed to the 20 in a proper imperial pint.\n* Public school is actually \"private school\" in the US. When Americans say public school, they mean state schools.",

(vs. in the UK, you would enter the GROUND floor and the FIRST floor would be above you)\n\n\nAmericans use the word roommate instead of flatmate. Very few people actually rent shared bedroom space.\n\n\nSaying \"toilets\" is kind of uncommon and is seen as really informal. Call it a bathroom, washroom or restroom. \n\n\n\"Take away\" is called \"food taken to go\" or \"take out\".\n\n\nNot slang but tipping %15-18 is expected for the most part with some saying 20% is normal for good service. Tip taxi drivers, hair dressers, at restaurants, coffee shops, etc. If you buy a drink at a relatively popular bar or a club in a major city, tipping ridiculous (&gt;20%) is almost expected.\n\n\nWhen crossing the street, not only do you have to adjust to looking for traffic in the opposite direction, americans can also turn right on a red light after stopping (where brits can't turn left on a red light)\n\n\nIt's normal/polite to engage in friendly small talk with strangers in America (while standing in line, on the bus, in a park, etc). Strangers might be super friendly but it doesn't mean they want to be your friend after this brief encounter.\n\n\nWater at restaurants always come with ice.\n\n\nA bit specific and something that might never come up -\n\n I'm not American but I've noticed there's a mixed reaction when referring to someone as \"black\". Even something like, \"that black girl is wearing a great dress\" can create a sense that you've misspoken. Remember to say \"african american\" even if you are talking about a black person who isn't African nor American.\n\n\nAlso don't bring up WW2.",

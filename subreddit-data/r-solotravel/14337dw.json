    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI (20M) am currently in the process of creating an itinerary for solo traveling Southern Europe, and after reading other posts, I've decided that my original itinerary was far too ambitious and am currently in the process of paring down my original plans to create a more manageable schedule. This is my first time planning a trip by myself, and I'm a bit overwhelmed and nervous because I'm not too experienced in this, so any feedback would be appreciated! Currently, I've got 4 schedules in mind, and I was wondering which one you guys would recommend.\n\nFor a bit of context, I'm used to fairly rigorous travel schedules since that's the way that my family likes to travel. For reference, my family visited Rome, Florence, Milan, Venice, and Vatican City within 9 days, and it was hectic but fun, though I'm looking to take it a bit easier this time since it's going to be my first time traveling solo. Another important note is that I will be studying abroad in London this upcoming fall and am taking fairly easy classes, so I will have ample time to travel and, thus, can push some destinations to later dates if it's a bit too crammed or if some places may be better in the fall. Also, I really love warm/hot weather and beaches, so I'd appreciate any suggestions or modifications to my proposed schedules (in terms of destinations, suggestions for activities, or times spent at certain locations).\n\nSchedule 1: Spain-France-Greece-Malta\n\nAugust 28th - August 30th: Seville (Day trip to Granada)  \nAugust 31st - September 1st: Madrid  \nSeptember 2nd - September 5th: Barcelona  \nSeptember 6th - September 9th: Nice (Day trip to Monaco / Eze / Cannes)  \nSeptember 10th - September 13th: Athens (Day trip to Greek islands)  \nSeptember 14th - September 16th: Valletta\n\nSchedule 2: Portugal-Spain-France-Malta\n\nAugust 28th - August 29th: Porto  \nAugust 30th - September 1st: Lisbon (Day trip to Sintra)  \nSeptember 2nd - September 4th: Seville (Day trip to Granada)  \nSeptember 5th - September 6th: Madrid  \nSeptember 7th - September 9th: Barcelona  \nSeptember 10th - September 13th: Nice (Day trip to Monaco / Eze / Cannes)  \nSeptember 14th - September 16th: Valletta\n\nSchedule 3: Portugal-Spain-Greece-Malta\n\nAugust 28th - August 29th: Porto  \nAugust 30th - September 1st: Lisbon (Day trip to Sintra)  \nSeptember 2nd - September 4th: Seville (Day trip to Granada)  \nSeptember 5th - September 6th: Madrid  \nSeptember 7th - September 10th: Barcelona  \nSeptember 11th - September 13th: Athens (Day trip to Greek islands)  \nSeptember 14th - September 16th: Valletta\n\nSchedule 4: Portugal-Spain-Malta\n\nAugust 28th - August 30th: Porto  \nAugust 31st - September 2nd: Lisbon (Day trip to Sintra)  \nSeptember 3rd - September 5th: Seville (Day trip to Granada)  \nSeptember 6th - September 8th: Madrid (Day trip to Toledo)  \nSeptember 9th - September 13th: Barcelona (Day trip somewhere)  \nSeptember 14th - September 16th: Valletta\n\nRight now, my ranking of preferences are Schedule 1 (Can visit Portugal in fall) &gt; Schedule 4 (Most Manageable) &gt; Schedule 2 &gt; Schedule 3 (Greece is still warm in fall), but am totally open to listening to any feedback or suggestions. Also, feel free to mix and match schedules if you feel like there's a better collection of destinations to be found or swap out some destinations for others, though Seville, Barcelona, and Valletta are must-go cities for me. Thanks!",

I've also been thinking about a different schedule of Spain-Greece-Malta and leaving Portugal for sometime later in the fall and am curious about your thoughts of: Seville-Madrid?-Barcelona-Athens-Valletta over the course of 20 days.",

I would limit it to no more than 5 cities and give yourself travel days exclusively for travel and nothing else becuase traveling between cities and checking into hotels is exhausting.",

Rent a car, drive along the south coast to cities like C nu adiz, Ronda, Malaga and Grenada. End in Barcelona. You could spend a week in either of your cities, your fear of missing out is making you missing out the real Spain.",

Unfortunately, I haven't driven a car in a couple of years, so I don't feel extremely comfortable road-tripping, but if you've got any advice about taking trains / other forms of public transport to see these south coast cities, I'd be interested in learning more!",

There are some scenic trainroutes in Spain (Barcelona-Valencia), I do not know of the south coast railway system, but take a look at what blogger bontraveler.com has to say about traveling by train and/or coach in Andalucia. Have fun. For me the South Coast is the best part of Spain. Enjoy the food and great people there.",

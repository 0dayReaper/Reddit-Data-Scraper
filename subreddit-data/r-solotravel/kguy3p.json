    "postText": "I commented on someone's post about this but figured I'd make a whole post. I'm a huge fan of making friends while traveling and still keep in touch with random one-off friends I made in weird places. I think it's a special bond. Here are some ways I break the ice. \n\n**Note:** I've been on both sides of this as the lone traveler who has met and made friends with other solo travelers and groups, as well as the person in a group who has absorbed an orphan traveler into our group for the day/week. \n\n**These have worked for me:**\n\n* **Wear or carry something distinctive, something that relates to your hobbies or passions.** I put stickers on literally everything and all my stickers relate to my hobbies/interests/bands/shows/books. So many people will stop and be like \"ahh, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy sticker!\" or \"The Office!\" (even though everyone loves The Office, doesn't matter). Talking about *something* leads to talking about anything. More people than you realize want to make friends, they just feel weird as hell like you do. I live in Alaska so if I put something that says Alaska on it, people will inevitably comment on it **but** be wary of geographically identifiable clothing as it can make you a target as a tourist in less safe places.\n* **Just ask people why they're traveling and where they're from.** Everyone thinks they're a grand explorer when they leave home and they're dying to talk about it.\n* **Be interested in listening, don't feel pressured to talk.** Being interested is way more effective in making connections than being *interesting,* as people are more likely to want to hear your stories if they feel bonded to you and not like you're some weird stranger, vomiting your story all over them. So ask questions and actually listen, listening is super rare and always extremely appreciated.\n* **Act open and excited, people are drawn to that shit.** Don't be weird, but don't be jaded. Sometimes anxiety can manifest as someone looking bored/disinterested, but nobody wants to have to pry someone out of their shell to get to know them. Be mindful of your paralanguage (non-verbals) and how closed-off you seem.\n* **Practice trying new social techniques.** If you fuck it up and make it weird, you will literally never see them again and nothing matters. I've done some insanely awkward shit in the name of travel and while I didn't always make a lifelong friend, I definitely have some interesting stories.\n* **Be open to new things.** Just because something doesn't sound fun, doesn't mean it can't lead to something fun. Sometimes I think we travel to distant lands just to do the same shit we do back home. Challenge yourself. Your routine will always be waiting for you back home. For example, I went motorbiking in Bermuda for the first time, it was scary as hell and my new friend broke her ankle and I accidently drove into a prison complex but did I have fun? Fuck yeah.\n* **Don't wait for others to do a cool thing.** Do that cool thing and you will invariably find people there who do cool things. Your friends don't want to go to an Irish pub in motherfucking Ireland? Well guess what that pub is full of? People who want to be in Irish pubs. \n* **Take an active interest in the local culture.** Locals love sharing the regional drama, love being experts in their country, and delight in foreigners who aren't just there to see That One Tourist Destination. Most of them will complain about tourists, and that's half the fun. Like I said, in Alaska we joke about Tourist Hunting Season and complain about how our downtowns are flooded with outsiders every summer, but given the chance we will regale you with our crazy outdoor adventures and brag about how our cousin's ex-boyfriend was a crab fisher on season 3 of That Crab Fishing Show Whose Name I Can't Remember.\n* **Don't be sloppy.** Nobody wants to hang out a second time with the dumpster person who got blackout and stuck their group with their tab.\n* **Go on dates!** (if you're single, obvs) I've met some cool-ass people while traveling and swiping. As long as you're up front about your boundaries and what you're looking for, lots of locals are down for a one-off date and they probably know the \"cool local spot\" that they're excited to show you. I got roasted by Judah Friedlander at a comedy show on a date in NYC once. Probably wouldn't have known about it if my dated hadn't told me about that comedy show. \n* **Lastly, don't get stuck in your demographic.** Some of the coolest people I've met while traveling were way older. For example, when I was 26 I did shots in Iceland with a 65-year-old travel agent while her husband cheered us on and she still sends me periodic updates about her grandkids. Old people are cool as hell, hang out with them.\n\nAdd your own!",

Chances are if they are traveling, they are the kind of people you want to hang out with.\n\nI remember meeting a rather older couple in Turkey who turned out to be amazing and asked if I wanted to join them on a jaunt to some ruins on the Syria border. They were amazing.\n\nETA: Silver! You guys....Thanks so much, that is very sweet!",

My go to is asking how long they\u2019ve been in the city and what they\u2019ve done. \n\nGoing on dates is also super helpful. Paid for tinder passport to get a head start and not waste time on dating apps while traveling. Be honest and don\u2019t mislead anyone. I\u2019ve had several priceless days being taken to favorite spots of local friends. I\u2019ve also returned the favor in my own city.",

                    "comment": "In my experience there's a certain set of ingredients that make for a hostel that is perfect for meeting people:\n\n1) Most important. All the reviews rave about how friendly and helpful the host is. Really sociable hosts who hang out in the common room act as perfect catalysts for everyone getting together. Even if it just so happens there are no guests around you'll be chatting to the host and sooner or later another guest will appear and join in. \n\n(Beyond this, helpful hosts are in my view, the single biggest \"make or break\" thing for any stay anywhere and reviews talking about how wonderful the host was is always the one thing I look for when choosing accommodation. But that's just me.)\n\n2) Free breakfast. In my experience breakfast is better than bars for meeting people. We're all sat round the same table. Approaching someone at a bar can be very hard if you're very shy but sat round the breakfast table, especially as people plan their trips in the morning, is perfect. Other free meals is even better.\n\n\n3) A few day trips. I don't like big organised tours but I love hostel day trips or even 2-3 day trips. They are the perfect midway point between the freedom of solo travel and the ease and sociability of organised tours. Besides, being organised by the hostel the people you meet don't just disappear to their own accommodation at the end of the trip.\n\n4) your mileage may vary but a particular size. I always find small but not tiny hostels more close knit and sociable than big ones.\n\n5) Another YMMV and not really an issue of choosing the hostel itself, but hostels in smaller places a little bit off the beaten track tend to be more sociable as there are less large groups of rather cliquey, often younger (sorry) travellers.",

I've never paid attention to that, but thinking about the different hostels that I have stayed at, it is a perfect descriptor.  There are some times where I didn't even realize the host was the host--they just hung around and talked with everyone.  I'll have to pay more attention when I start travelling again. \n\n2) I've had success with the free breakfast for planning, but I have never really liked the breakfast.  I've always preferred to go out for breakfast on my way to my first destination, but again, thinking about how it is the perfect recipe for meeting people I'll pay more attention to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGreat tips!",

There is usually tons of local food to try for other meals (...or second breakfast like the hobbit I am).",

I normally say excuse me, may I ask your opinion on something? It will normally bring people's guard down. \n\nFor example, one time I went to a brewery in Amsterdam and happened to sit too far from the beer menu to actually read the descriptions so when my first beer was getting low I asked the guy sitting next to me if he had any suggestions on a beer since I wasn't familiar with the beer names. I explained that I was visiting from the US and it seemed like these were all local beers. He happily gave me suggestions and we ended up chatting the night away. \n\nMy favorite one is the time I was visiting Vermont for a wedding and had 10 hours to kill before I could check in to my room. My phone died so I popped into a bar to charge it. Ended up asking an older couple next to me if they were locals and if they had any local hidden gems that I should check out. They happily listed off a number of places and the wife told me that she could play tour guide, if I wanted. I took her up on the offer and also got a really cool look into the background of the town including all the local gossip and got to see some awesome places that weren't listed anywhere online. It made the 10 hours fly by and is one of my favorite random travel memories.",

It ruins the vibe and you'll have a much more genuine fun experience if you're looking to get along and have fun. \n\nI wanted to add a couple small things that bring up your value as a person socializing when travelling:\n\n- USB multisplitter cable. Basically I was able to charge phones or devices of anyone in need with my power bank and universal cable. Easy way to make friends :)\n\n- Bluetooth speaker. It helps if you have a crowdpleasing music taste and know of different genres that appeal to different crowds. I made LOTS of friends like this but also, music is my go to topic for bonding with people. There's lots of portable Bluetooth speakers to choose from that pack a punch\n\n- Good camera with basic photography skills. I got into photography with a point and shoot with my travels and only got better with experience. Everyone loves pictures of themselves and I became pretty popular with backpackers at my lodgings because I'd just dump my awesome photos on a Google album overnight and ready the next day right away. Even starting a shared album goes a long way\n\n- Don't be afraid to start group chats to coordinate. If you admin them and have general plans with people, you'll notice people will want to join you. Ofcourse this requires planning for things to do as well so don't be lazy and plan. I'd literally just watch a YouTube video \"Top  things to in [destination]\", label those points on my google map, and ask if anyone wanted to join me. With that being said, don't be a gatekeeper douche and be welcoming of people",

There were days when I didn\u2019t really talk to anyone if I didn\u2019t speak the language in the country I was in. \n\nI am not afraid to ask advice of locals or travelers or to help anyone out. So that is always a way to make a connection. \n\nI met people that invited me to their home in another country and many times I did look them up and stay with them. Sometimes it was out of my way but it was the best experience to be with the locals and learn from them. I met groups of travelers who I hung out with for weeks. It was such a fantastic time. I like meeting people so it makes it easier for me. I\u2019m good at listening too. That was some good advice in the post. \n\nThere were times that I was truly alone. What makes it easier is to be okay with that and to try to enjoy the moment you are in. That alone can attract people as well. And if not, at least you are enjoying the adventure. \n\nSometimes when you see groups of people and you are alone it makes you feel even more alone. You have to get past those moments because around the corner will be a better one. \n\nAsk lots of questions everywhere you go. Questions open conversation and help you learn. We don\u2019t learn from talking. \n\nI am looking forward to traveling again, soon, with or without a friend. It won\u2019t stop me if I\u2019m  alone. When I retire in a few years, maybe some young folks will hang out in a foreign town with me and not be afraid of my age. Good advice btw. I never looked at age and hung out with older and younger people. \n\nHappy travels everyone! Good luck on your next trip!",

            "comment": "Adding something for the obvious, for those finding this on searches. If you have trouble meeting people at hostels, you either have one of two problems. One, while it's helpful to be proactive, you literally have to shut people off to not meet people. Someone should approach you, and if you go to the common areas, you WILL meet people. If you talk to people, you it's the easiest place in the world to make friends. Even those who are scared to leave the dorm alone will be noticed and approached usually, but even a little effort will go a long way.\n\nTwo, if you are actually try, and can't make connections, you need to take a hard look in the mirror. You are doing something wrong. Even poor socializers with bad habits still meet people if they try. If people hang out, and avoid you afterwards, or consistently decline approaches, you ARE 'that' person at hostels. If you have close friends, ask them to tell you the stone-cold truth that you don't want to hear.\n\nFor me, staying at a hostel is borderline forced sociability. Sometimes I want a day inside to myself, and it's usually harder to have that than be alone. I personally have a policy of NO SHIT TALKING in the hostel, even for people I don't like. If someone says something about an annoying bunkmate, I'll ignore them and talk about something else. If the peace gets broken, it's over outright unacceptable behavior, like LOUD sex (it's bad enough if you are fucking in a bunk, but fucking like you are in a private home is not cool), stealing, or unacceptable and confrontational behavior. I'll usually report this to the hostel (it's astounding how few people do), or if that fails or I have no confidence, I'll take matters into my own hands.",

People I *did* meet just kind of came about naturally which is the way it should be, I guess. Travellers will *always* meet people one way or another no matter what kind of personality they have.

When you get there you may find an already put together tour guide that makes everything convenient. Most places you stay or the airport expect that you want to know what to do/see there so something or someone is prepared to give options or answer questions. Don't stress about booking tours unless it's really popular or something you know you want to do 100%. You may miss flights, miss trains, miss buses, you may misunderstand information or costs, you may lose items - ok, how would you solve this at home? You're still just human and so is everyone around you. Like someone else said here, everything everywhere is basically the same, it just looks different. All humans need or desire the same things, just each country has their own tweak of getting it.

            "comment": "This makes me miss my solo backpacking through Europe when I was 24! I agree with all these tips.\n\n- stay in a hostel no matter your age. If you're worried, stay in a nicer hostel where you can get your own room and bathroom. I've met people in almost every hostel I've stayed it (not you, crappy Prague and Dublin hostels!). If you don't stay in a hostel it will be a SOLO trip. Some people prefer that but just be aware.\n\n- find a hostel with a nice bar. People will talk to you if you're drinking by yourself at a hostel bar and they usually won't be creeps. If you don't listen to the above tip and decide you actually do want to meet people, at least visit a hostel bar if you don't say in one. \n\n- related to above, find a hostel with a nice gathering area, one where people actually want to hang out.\n\n- read reviews on how nice the staff are and if they engage with guests. It's a red flag if those reviews aren't good.\n\n- a lot of super popular hostels have gotten too big and suck for that reason so keep that in mind (looking at you, Flying Pig in Amsterdam)\n\n\n- if you don't even want to look in the direction of a hostel, AirBnb experiences are a good way to meet travelers and locals. \n\n\n- ...just talk to people?? idk, I talk to strangers all the time and I'm comfortable with doing it in almost all situations. Of course there are times where I get nowhere with people too, so here's what I recommend for that, some shitty life pro tips below:\n\n- drinking. go on a bar crawl, drink at your hostel bar, etc. There's literally no way you won't meet people doing this\n\n- smoking. Asking someone for a light or a smoke is an easy and natural way to strike up a conversation. yeah yeah yeah i know it's not healthy but it works every single time, I've never not met someone on a smoke break. if it's not for you then don't do it.\n\n- other substances. use your imagination but substances are a very social experience.\n\n- if someone invites you to do something with them, say yes unless you have a good reason to say no.\n\nIf everyone at your hostel sucks, here's some things you can do.\n\n- go on a bar crawl. just go by yourself and try to have fun, if you don't like it, you can always leave, but you'll prob meet at least a few people.\n\n- go on a walking tour. You should do this either way - it's the best way to learn where everything is in the city.\n\n- try something the city is known for - in Bruges I did a beer tasting, in Thailand, I did a cooking class.\n\n- if people just really flat out suck - try a dating app. can't vouch for this myself since it's never gotten to this point for me, but you can definitely find someone who will have dinner with you at least.\n\n- is couchsurfing still a thing? sometimes people on couchsurfing will meet up with you and show you around.",

Only when I was in the middle of the group did I realize I was in the middle of a chain gang. They were talking/waving at me and I was reflecting on how weird it was when I kinda snapped to and realized I was in a correctional facility ground.

Trust your gut, but don't turn down an opportunity just because it doesn't seem like your kind of thing on the surface level. For example, I'm vegan, but one time my neighbors in the next campsite over invited me to join them as they were heading into town for some pizza. Even though I wouldn't be eating the cheesy food, I decided to go along with them for a beer and some conversation, and I had a great time. At the end of the day, it often doesn't much matter *what* you're doing with them. With most of those types of invitations, the actual activity is simply an excuse to get a bit of your time. So go out for that pizza you won't even eat. Accept an invitation to a country music festival even if you're a hard rock kind of guy. At the very least, you're sure to meet some interesting people.",

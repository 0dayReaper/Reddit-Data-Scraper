    "postText": "If you\u2019re like me and love to solo travel but the social aspect - staying in hostels etc causes you anxiety - would you be open to the idea of joining an online group of others who have SA and like to solo travel? \n\nThe way I picture it would be an international online group, for people with SA or for those who may just be introverted or shy, people who understand each other and our mutual struggles so there would be less pressure to perform socially. People could post what location they were planning to visit / currently in, to see if there was anyone else in the group at the location that would be interested in exploring the area together. \n\nFor me I\u2019ve found that I\u2019m far more comfortable around others who share my social anxiety struggles, and I feel something like this would be super beneficial to me while travelling. \n\nI know this concept obviously completely goes against the idea of \u2018solo\u2019 travelling but sometimes it can be nice to share an experience with others while on your own in a foreign place!",

I can hang out with someone all day, share experiences and then we all move on.\n\n\nFor me, it's the only time where there's no pressure to 'fit in' because it truly doesn't matter. You have no social consequences.  Everyone is trying to have a good experience and be open. No one is around long enough to think about you. \n\n\nSometimes you meet people and sometimes you don't. It doesn't matter because you're there for yourself and your own trip. I feel awkward no matter where I am but I am confidently awkward while traveling.",

As a shy person who used to travel a lot with a partner diagnosed with social anxiety, we found that the **Hangouts** feature of the **Couchsurfing** app was a comfortable and reliable way to find groups of people to have meals with and do activities with, in most of the cities we visited. For the most part we met chill and low-key people, unless we were really looking for a big party group (rarely did).\n\nI guess we weren't exactly \"solo\" traveling, since we had each other, but I wanted to suggest Hangouts here because not everyone knows about it. (Couchsurfing is free btw! The paid verification is not required to use the Hangouts feature.)\n\nAlso, OP, you might want to consider another acronym for social anxiety, since online discussions usually use SA to mean \"sexual assault\" -- just a suggestion!",

Occasionally someone will invite me to something and I'll go along with it! That helps me anyways. I feel like a group of other people with SA may not work because everyone would be too anxious to meet up. But I dont see why you shouldn't try!",

If hostels make you anxious, that's perfectly understandable (I won't do them, personally).  Don't let that hold you back from going to the places you want to visit!  You can find lots of alternatives that suit your style and comfort level without forcing yourself into something that causes you anxiety.",

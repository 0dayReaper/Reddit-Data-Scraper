    "postText": "I really don't like being in crowds, and I'm guessing most of you don't either.  The easiest way to avoid crowds is just to wake up early.  \n\nYou can have a very leisurely morning breakfast, go for a nice long walk alone in a very picturesque neighborhood or park, go see some usually-crowded sights, and then have an early lunch when restaurants aren't busy and the food is freshest. I'm also self-conscious when eating alone in most busy restaurants, but I don't care at all when there's hardly anyone else eating.  \n\nI just saw a post in r/travel where someone said it's impossible to avoid pictures with ridiculous crowds at the Great Wall of China.  Well, I just woke up early, and walked nearly the entire public section of Mutianyu very leisurely before anyone else showed up except a couple vendors setting up for the day.  https://imgur.com/gallery/mTiiYYg\n\nThen I often take a break in the early afternoon when everyone else is crowding transit and cafes and restaurants and shops and sights and cool neighborhoods -- eg, laying in a park, the beach, back in my room doing some planning, hostel common area, etc.  Then in late afternoon/early evening I like to visit places that opened later and have usually slowed down -- shops, teahouses, cafes, markets, art galleries, etc.  Then again, have an early dinner while food is freshest, service is fast, and there's hardly anyone else there.\n\nWhat about nightlife and drinking?  Well, I haven't really drunk much since my first year or so of traveling.  Of course drinking is a highlight for a lot of travelers, but honestly I'd rather drink at home.  If there's a type of drink or nightlife experience I'd like -- again, I'll go early at night when again there are fewer people and faster service.  I've also found that it's a lot easier to meet and have conversations earlier on, especially local folk.  Obviously I don't go hard partying much, but once in a while I'll stay out late and wake up later, especially when there's music or another event I want to see.\n\nI'm not a \"morning person\" at all at home.  I woke up at 10:30am this morning for example.  But, I find it a lot easier traveling since I'm usually exhausted and a little jet lagged the first day anyway, and it's easier to reset my schedule to go to bed &amp; wake up early.  I've never been able to convince travel partners to do this with me, and I'm more likely to stay out late with other travel partners, but going solo it's easy.\n\nAnyone else have experience with successes waking up early while traveling?",

E.g. right at the Grand Canyon day light is from 6:20 am - 6:19 pm.   Once it's dark you can't see anything.  \n\nSun-rise and Sun-Set times can be found for each destination, I actually plan my wake up time accordingly to be showered and out the door of the hotel shortly after sun rise.\n\nThe other factor I'm finding is when hotels serves breakfast - if it's included in the price.  If they have a buffet you can usually eat enough to allow you to skip or have a very late lunch .. , so its good to get it, but if they don't start serving it until 7 am or  8 am ... it can be another limiting factor.",

Its always been shockingly empty (because everyone tells everyone to go places in the morning) and you can get the same kind of light for photos!

We usually end up leaving by 2pm, have a late lunch, and then basically have a siesta and eat an early dinner. I don't like nightlife, usually, and I don't drink while traveling, unless it's a special occasion, so being in bed by 8pm is fine by me.\n\nIt sounds exhausting when I describe this to a lot of other people, but I get most enjoyment out of a place when we do this.",

It doesn\u2019t matter how early I go to bed, if I\u2019m up before 9-10 I\u2019m going to be low energy and unfocused for hours. When I have 9am meetings and have to get up before 8 I\u2019ll go to bed extra early and make sure I get 8-9 hours of sleep but still be absolutely exhausted-feeling until mid-afternoon. I once had a job which required an hour commute and being up before 5am and I spent the entire time working there tired and miserable. I\u2019ve been like this for a decade now at least. \n\nSo for me early morning while traveling really doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019d far rather stay out super late even when I\u2019m not into the nightlife scene in a big way. If I can avoid it, I will never set an alarm while traveling. I just feel so much better allowing myself to wake up naturally mid to late morning, it\u2019s what my body wants and I can\u2019t always do that in normal life at home, so why on earth would I fight it when I\u2019m on vacation?",

There is an entire type of tourists, the \"rise and shine crowd\" who ALWAYS get to the popular places at the opening hour. Not surprisingly, since they are all getting up early, there is ALWAYS a crowd. Early morning travelers see this and will respond \"hah! Glad we got here early, imagine how crowded it would be in the afternoon!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the truth is going to big spots \"off schedule\" in the afternoon, or early evening by then tourists have dispersed into a bunch of smaller crowds- dinner reservations, shows, walking tours, smaller sights, maybe even going home to take a nap because they woke up so early. So if you go then, you rarely find yourself in much or if any crowd at all. I have found myself experiencing super popular sites with few people at all around me!",

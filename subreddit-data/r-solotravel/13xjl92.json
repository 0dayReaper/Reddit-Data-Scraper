    "postText": "**If you plan to use it for a date past the 10th of a calendar month, but not the next month, make sure you buy it at the start of that month (even if you're not in Germany yet) and cancel the subscription right after.**\n\nI say this because I just got burned by DB for my end of May trip through Northern Germany where I got the Deutschland-Ticket for the month of May without intending to get it for the month of June too, but when I went to cancel the subscription at the end of May, they told me it can only be cancelled in the first 10 days of the month prior, meaning I have to pay for June as well despite not planning to use it that month so what I thought was going to be a \u20ac49 cost is going to end up being a \u20ac98 cost for me which isn't as much of a great deal for just a few days of trains and transit. \n\nCall me stupid for not reading the fine print or looking into the cancellation policy beforehand if you want, but this was never mentioned in any of the travel articles I found promoting the ticket, nor specified clearly on the DB webpage for it so I assumed I could cancel it anytime before the next month without issue, but I assumed wrong and I imagine several others will run into the same issue hence why I wanted to share my experience. \n\n*For those unaware, the Deutschland-Ticket allows you to use all public transit in Germany (buses, metros, trams, etc) as well as regional trains (no ICE trains) at a cost of \u20ac49 per month, however it requires a European IBAN account to purchase, is only valid from the 1st to the last day of the calendar month you purchase it in (regardless of when you purchase it that month) and has a shitty cancellation policy, as demonstrated in this post.*\n\nEdit: turns out this cancellation policy is only relevant if you bought it directly from DB. There are other providers like Mopla which have better cancellation policies, as pointed out in the comments so be sure to buy your ticket from them instead!",

            "comment": "Sorry you\u2018ve had a bad experience, I agree that for tourists these rules are not particularly obvious; however while it is officially a subscription service several Transport associations ([Verkehrsverb\u00fcnde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German_transport_associations)) have started to compete with each over potential customers by offering additional perks. Say you live in Hamburg you can actually buy the Deutschlandticket via the BVG in Berlin, as they perhaps may offer better additional perks. ([Here](https://www.deutschlandticket-rabatte.de/#kuendigung)&amp; [here](https://gist.github.com/rena2019/a2d32769a685ed26c3e3b3bbfe151859) is a list of all the additional benefits that different regional providers offer)\n\nWith most providers you officially have to end your subscription by the 10th of a month for the subscription to not roll over into the next month; but there\u2019re also now a number of providers that let you cancel it up until the last day of validity. This makes it much more appealing for tourists, one of them is [Mopla](https://www.mopla.solutions/de/tickets/deutschlandticket) ; there\u2019s also another regional provider that charges you less for the Deutschlandticket if you start your subscription later in the month; it\u2019s definitely worth checking out what the different regional providers offer in terms of extra benefits.",

As I understand it the ticket has no cancellation policy but the cancellation policy depends on where you buy it. Personally I think it's pretty generous and far from shitty for a subscription to have only a one month minimum. The ticket is not intended for tourists, but for residents, hence the subscription model and not that convenient conditions from a tourist perspective.",

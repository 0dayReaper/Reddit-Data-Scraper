    "postText": "Ok..bear with me. So. I am married, planning on starting a family soon, however, I have a last \"big\" item on my bucket list that needs to be checked (ok, it doesn't *need* to be checked, but it'd be nice). Due to reasons, I might not be able to travel until I will be around 5 months pregnant. \n\nMy question: have you ever met pregnant ladies traveling alone? Or have you ever traveled alone while pregnant? I'm thinking that it's easier to travel now than after having a family, as the place I'd like to go to is quite expensive. Of note, my husband isn't really interested to come and he supports me fully.\n\n\nI know that at the end of the day, it's only my and his opinion that matters, but I would like to hear my fellow travelers opinions. Thank you!",

Our health service (NHS) actually recommends the mid-pregnancy phase as the safest/most comfortable one to travel, if you have to. https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/travelling/\n\nIssues will mostly be: insurance, which may not cover pregnancy as a 'preexisting' condition, and the variable care available depending on where you're going, and less importantly the fact that some travel experieces may not be available to you (see also: some foods, alcohol, etc!)\n\nThere is of course also the fact that you're not guaranteed to get pregnant when you want to, so you could be anything from not pregnant to 5 months pregnant by this point, it's not predictable, nor are any pregnancy-related complications that might prevent you travelling at all \n\nI imagine you'd feel pretty daft if you didn't book this trip and then found you *weren't* 5 months pregnant and there was nothing to stop you going.",

            "comment": "I asked my brother who has 3 kids himself. He said fucking do it because once you start popping out kids, 95% of your freedom and money will be gone.\n\nYou mentioned these places are expensive....so......do it before your time and money will be drained by kids.\n\nHe also said yes to traveling with kids making everythinnnnnng exponentially harder. \n\nYour husband doesn't want to go? Fantastic. Take advantage of your freedom, but be prepared to be lonely for most of your trip.\n\nEdit*: from my brother: when you travel with kids you now have to worry about tantrums, if they're picky eaters (this will absolutely narrow your eatery selections), how much energy they have to walk around (they had to go back to the hotel for naps which severely messed up their plans), if they get bored easily, where to potty, pack enough snacks that they like in case they don't like different foods and ration them, kids get hot easily and will be uncomfortable (queue the tantrum), kids do not handle jetlag well, will you carry them when they want you to? For how long can you last doing that? Strollers are an absolute pain to travel with. Also, it's a new area how will your kid deal with sensory overload (usually freak out)? How\n will you keep your kids entertaining on a long car ride/airplane(will the tablet battery last long enough?)? What if the kid doesn't want to leave the hotel room and is burnt out on traveling? Etc etc etc etc",

I've fallen or tripped over curbs overseas. Being pregnant would include a whole new layer of worry.\n\nTalk to your OB/GYN, they know your health history and any risk factors.",

We planned a lot of IVF around international travel, and our doctors never had an issue if it was going to be second trimester.\n\n(As it transpired, the pregnancy that stuck didn\u2019t coincide with any big trips so I don\u2019t think my beautiful wife did much more than a mini-break away. But the docs seemed fine if she had.)",

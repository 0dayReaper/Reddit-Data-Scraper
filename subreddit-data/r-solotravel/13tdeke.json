    "postText": "Will be in Norway for 2 weeks, and in Bergen around 2nd week of July. Itinerary is quite complete, except for the mentioned day. I initially planned to join the glacier tour, but reading through it again, it seems not fitting for my taste (preference on small group for tours)\n\nAlready planned to go for a day trip (each) to Voss &amp; Flam (incl. Gudvangen), (group) hiking in Floyen, and another to Bruvik area.\n\nI wanted a day trip only - leaving Bergen in the morning, then return the same day. Because I already have hotel booking. Also, will only travel by public transport.\n\nNo preference on the activity - sightseeing, (group) hiking, etc. as long as its not something extreme (I'm not prepared for that yet). And for hiking, I would say I'm between beginner and intermediate.\n\nI was initially thinking of joining the Trolltunga hiking. But I cannot fit it anymore in the schedule - because according to my estimate, I need at least 2 days for it.\n\nIf it matters, I'm 30M. Not extremely fit, but have no physical issues whatsoever. Been searching, but most of the suggestion involves driving",

Bergen is a great place to just relax and enjoy the food and sites, so an easy day, or somewhat of a rest day, could be well worth your time. There are a few great food tours there too. Good luck.",

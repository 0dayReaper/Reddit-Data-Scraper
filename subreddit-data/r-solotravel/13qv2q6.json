    "postText": "I am a 20 year guy from europe, I decided to go to the US for a few months (3 to 6 months, depends on how much i like it).\n\nI enjoy going to bars, clubbing, going to the gym and the beach. I'm single and looking to meet people around my same age range, what's the best city for me to go to? I'm looking to not spend more than 4000 USD a month. \n\nI was considering the miami area but someone told me I wouldn't have much fun since I'm under 21 and in the US minimum age requirement for clubs and drinks is 21. \n\nI would like to remain on the east coast if possible but I'm open to the west coast as well.\n\nI'd appreciate a lot if you guys could give me some recommendations.\n\nPS two things that would be a plus would be: An efficient uber/ lyft service, and not too many mosquitos.",

You could always stay in San Diego great nightlife and Tijuana is close so u can always bring alc back from there or go party in Rosarito. But if I'd have to recommend some cities for what you stated ima have to go with New Orleans. Great night life,Food,Culture and sights. Second if you intrested in country Nashville could be a cool spot.  4th ima go with Las Vegas I mean it's Vegas it's the king of nightlife and 4 is LA or Miami both great for what your looking for although I'd say Miami is better.",

Really due to sprawl, the Uber/lyfts will take a large chunk out of your budget as well. \n\nLiving arrangements will be high during the summer months as well. Idk if you'll be doing BnB, but a solid place in San Diego, for example, will run anywhere between $1600-$3000. San Diego kind of fits your criteria, but it's a high cost of living city. $4,000 will go quick. \n\nTry South America. Peru. Mexico City. Colombia. All have minimum drinking age set at 18.",

But honestly most bar owners don't want a bunch of broke-ass under-21 people in their bar who can't even drink their most profitable product. So even in states where it is allowed, it isn't common.\n\nAnd with now even tobacco being 21+, it means 18-20 aren't even allowed in hookah bars anymore.\n\nThis isn't to say Americans under 21 don't drink. They do, but they mostly do it at home or with their friends  or at house parties rather than established businesses. You'd need to be a particularly sociable person to break through those barriers in your brief trip.\n\nSome college towns may have an atmosphere of \"looking the other way\" in years/decades past  but I think a lot of that has died out. Most liquor license holders aren't going to risk their livelihood just so they can sell a kid a $5 Michelob Ultra\n\n&gt;I'm looking to not spend more than 4000 USD a month.\n\nWhen you do turn 21, I think this is a more than fair budget. Big cities and nightlife can get expensive after a while but still manageable. Pre-game a bit and you'll be fine.",

I\u2019ve gone to Chicago with my girlfriend and spent over 2k in a week not including shelter. Unless you love the outdoors, the US is not a great country to travel for an under 21 who enjoys nightlife. Also, many group experiences through a tour are going to cost you easily over $100. Go visit Miami, or San Diego for a week and then head to Mexico, Colombia, Bolivia. You\u2019ll have the time of your life for a fraction of the cost. Or live like a king with the money you have.",

Chicago is great in the summer, best city in the US imo overall and very affordable to live. \n\nIt is affordable (not fucking cheap at all) In comparison to San Fran, NYC, and LA, but fucking expensive compared to Europe. Short term rentals like you are looking for will tear you a new one.\n\nI just got back from 8 months in Asia and the nightlife here is shit and expensive when compared to Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, or Seoul. Your dating plans are well...Idk, Asia better in that regard too haha.\n\nTl;DR, if you are looking to party and meet girls I would wait until you are 21 and come back next summer man (surely not this winter, winter here fucking sucks) \n\nP.S your $4000 a month for 3-4 months will have you gone for a year in most of SE and even East Asia and the quality of life is way higher there than this shit country. Looking to move there pernamently with my remote job hopefully by next year.\n\nGood luck bro and DM me if there is anything else you want to know :)",

Also you can still rent a car under 25 if needed (which you almost never need).  It\u2019s also not a shoestring budget, I literally did just about everything I wanted to do? And the being under 21 and drinking thing has nothing to do with budget lol.  Just because you do zero planning, only use 4 star hotels, and eat at high end restaurants when you travel doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s hard for normal people to not spend $4000 in a month lol",

Major car rental companies won\u2019t rent to you under 21 unless you are a government employee. Don\u2019t feed bullshit to a European who doesn\u2019t understand the cost of living. You think he\u2019s gonna get a market rate short term rental with no deposit in a popular major American city? Sorry but the last thing I would want as a fun loving 20 year old would be to come to a city where I won\u2019t be let into the things I like just to say \u201cI lived in Chicago for a month\u201d.  Who wants to stay in Chicago for a month anyway? Any good North American city can be experienced within 2 weeks. After that what the fuck are you really doing?",

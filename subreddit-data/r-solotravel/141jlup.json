    "postText": "Hi guys!! I wanted some feedback/experiences on hostels that I\u2019m planning to stay at during my solo trip. For background: i\u2019m 20f and am looking to meet people and have new experiences. \n\nPrague: 5 nights at Ahoy!Hostel. I\u2019m looking forward to exploring the Old Town and the castles. Likely going to Prague Castle and doing a day trip or two to Karl\u0161tejn and \u010cesky Krumlov. \n\nVienna: 5 nights at Wombats Vienna. I want to explore the cathedrals, especially St. Stephen\u2019s and maybe a catacomb tour because of their use as hospitals. I\u2019ll likely go to the palaces within and city and on the outskirts as well. I\u2019m planning on doing a trip to Bratislava as well. I definitely want to visit an art museum or two because of their collections (likely the national one). \n\nBudapest: 6 nights at the Hive Party Hostel. I\u2019m definitely doing trips outside of Budapest. I\u2019ll definitely go to the ruin bars just because I\u2019m curious of them. I\u2019m curious of the Thermal baths as well. The castles interest me again, like Buda and the museums around it. \n\nSplit: 6 nights at Backpackers. I\u2019m mostly going here for fun and to go island hopping, but use Split as my home base.",

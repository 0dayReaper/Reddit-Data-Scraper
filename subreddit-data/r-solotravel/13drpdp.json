    "postText": "I've been travelling for almost 10 months now. I worked in one place for 3 months and since then have been backpacking SE Asia for 5 months. I've usually bumped into people I've met along the way, but because I've been out here so long, people are going home. I try to stay in touch but they never seem to reciprocate. I talk to friends at home but not too much because they always ask about what I'm doing and I feel bad because they're at home working and it's hard to keep the conversation going.\n\nI feel drained from meeting new people but I also feel lonely. I'm craving proper connections with people, I miss it so much. I've planned to go back to my favourite place to volunteer and sit there for awhile, but that is still 2 months away and I can't bring my flight forward. \n\nI have my itinerary planned and I can't change it as I want to make the most of it. How can I get through the next two months alone but exhausted? \n\nI feel so guilty, people dream to be able to do what I'm doing now, but I don't feel myself, I feel like I have no purpose and have little energy or desire to do any touristy activities, I just want to exist in these places",

How can I get through the next two months alone but exhausted? \n\nThat you've planned you itinerary doesn't mean you can't change it. Plans change all the time. Even if you booked some things ahead, you can still change it though you may have some sunk costs due to cancellation costs and nonrefundable bookings. If you're miserable you have to change some things, losing a bit of money is a bad excuse for doing things that make you feel miserable.  \n\nMake changes to improve your experience or, possibly better, cut the trip short and go home. Long term travel is a drag and only few people manage to get satisfaction out of long term travel.",

Maybe mention where you are for the next 2 months and people will give you some ideas???\n\nLonger term, if you're American, you should look into the Peace Corps. if you want to visit a place long term and have more of a purpose and make connections.  \n\nTruth be told, the last trip to SE Asia I took with my GF, we did a lot of boring things.   We've both been multiple times (she's Asian) and thus we mostly just went out walking around, had dinners out, other meals in, netflix evenings, hung out at the pool.

If I were in your shoes and had financial ramifications to do so, part of your lost connections is on you - you're constantly moving from place to place.  I'd settle somewhere for 2-3 weeks and start making routines that involve other people (visiting a cafe, doing laundry, frequenting a restaurant/bar).  There's likely to be common staff or regulars who you will bump into and start making kinship if you're the least bit personable.  Now I will say making connections will be much easier in a smaller town/remote area than a large city.  In my short 10 days on a thai island, I started to hang out with cafe staff after their work hours because we'd crack jokes and form a bond while I ate meals with them serving.",

I'm sure you've already tried something like this, but how about chilling/recuperating for a few days?

Other folks have good tips for you, and I have a piece of advice for you-and others if they wish to apply it:   \n\nYou cannot starve yourself enough to help another eat. You cannot make yourself sick enough to make another person well. You cannot feel guilty enough about your good fortune in traveling to give another the good fortune to travel.   Feeling miserable in anything will not help another person with their struggle in anything.   I have begun to look at this type of misdirected guilt as a goblin that is sitting on your neck, feeding off your misery, making you stuck and miserable so that it can feed more.  And it prevents you from doing anything positive, anything that can bring good change.   \n\nSo-stop feeling guilty. When it comes to visit, banish it. Go outside, feel the fresh air and sunshine. Look for beauty and appreciate the day.  Eat a nourishing meal and watch the people go by. Relax and stop banging on yourself. Banishing guilt means tough self talk is needed. Perspective is needed. Maturity is needed. Humility is needed. \n\nIf it is too difficult to stay, then go home. Spend the money and go. Change plans. Change your venue. Move your feet and do something.   Humility is accepting that you have limitations. Guess what? It\u2019s not a big deal. Finding that you have limitations and must accept them can be hard. So what? The sun will still come up tomorrow. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have the money to change your travel plans, then find a way to earn some. And direct your energy toward going home. Let it be a direction in which to start movement. And banish the guilt, because it is not helping anything.\n\nI wish the very best for you, OP. You can do this and be happy again if you stop fighting with yourself over travel.",

Are you using an app to track achievements or something?\n\nThese aren't the 1800s, you're not exploring or discovering anything new, and you're eventually going to start bumping into familiar sights and experiences. It'll just kill the magic, imo.\n\nEither settle somewhere for 6 months to a year and blend in with the natives (if you don't have family and friends waiting at home), and do this until you've tried many different lifestyles. Or do short travel sessions, like maybe a week or two here, a month there, etc. I think that's healthier and a better way to keep things fresh and exciting.",

Depression is common in solo travel. one of the things i find is that most people travelling arent really travelers. They are young people doing a gap year or something. drinking, partying and just going through the itinerary that they had planned. Myself, i avoid the party hostels\" now.. random hookups and getting drunk is not very fulfilling. Plus i am older than many of the young travellers. I would rather have a quieter, deeper, ore meaningful conversation with someone than to walk past beer pong games in the lobby. it's a generalization, but maybe it will help you.",

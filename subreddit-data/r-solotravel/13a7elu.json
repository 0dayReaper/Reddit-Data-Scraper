    "postText": "I am a big fan of traveling off the beaten path. It leads to meeting some of the best people and having the coolest experiences. Often less (but not always the case) scams as there is less opportunistic scams and crime. You also often get to meet a wide variety of people who aren't just doing there gap year abroad to Thailand or the UK from North America or Western Europe. Plus, you get unique stories and photos that are not the same picture of Times Square, Big Ben, or The Eiffel tower that has been photographed 5,000,000,000,000 times! ;)\n\nA few of mine would be.\n\n1. **Bishkek and Ala-Archa National Park, Kyrgyzstan**\n\nI took a Marshrutka (shared taxi) for 12ish hours from Osh in Southern Kyrgyzstan to the capital Bishkek (which was an interesting experience in itself ) and people think I am crazy that I spent 2 weeks at the hostel there in Bishkek on my recent 8 month trip around Asia. The city has a really cool and unique vibe with really nice people, good plentiful food, and dirt cheap! Sort of like a Post-Soviet mashup of Russia and what you would imagine an Asian city to be. I was the only American at my hostel, almost everyone else were Russians escaping the mobilization and they all treated me like family! Nearby Ala-Archa national park is some of the most stunning nature and mountains that I have seen outside of Nepal, and you seem to have the whole place to yourself at times!\n\n2. **Belgrade, and Novi Sad Serbia**\n\nNot terribly off the beaten path, but certainly glossed over compared to most Western European cities. Hell, even glossed over or seen as a stop over compared to other places in the Balkans. The Non-EU countries in the Balkans are awesome in general. Amazing food, great nightlife, and dirt cheap. My hostel here also had the coolest people who I became great friends with. This seems to be a common theme amongst these lesser known gems. Seems to attract a really cool down to earth crowd. Not a bunch of bropackers, etc...lol\n\n3. **Road Tripping around Oman**\n\nOman, does not have a single hostel on Hostelworld. You pretty much also need to rent a car or hitchhike so it is not exactly a budget travel destination. However, this country is absolutely stunning. From the many Wadis, Forts, Desert landscapes, etc there is so much to see if you do a little research. Not to mention, the people are super warm and friendly and mostly all speak great English.\n\n4. **Malaysia in comparison to the rest of SE Asia.**\n\nMany people stop off in KL for 2-3 days for a stopover on the way to Singapore or Thailand. See the Batu caves and the Petronas towers and leave. I spent a few weeks in Penang on my past 8 month trip mentioned above and was there for the Chinese New Year and it was just incredible. Such a diverse culture with literally the best food in the world imho, friendly English speaking locals, super safe, and less greasy Sex tourists and bro packers than neighboring Thailand as it tends to be a more conservative culture with a high alcohol tax (but there is plenty of fun to be had there still!). Can not wait to return to the Eastern Borneo region in the future.\n\nIn the near future, I am really keen to backpack Mainland China outside of the main cities, Kurdish Iraq, Moldova, Ukraine (when it is safe), and Algeria to name a few. How about you guys? Which places top your lists!",

Going to Bali from there was almost like a culture shock.  \nI used to live in a village called Tepoztlan in Mexico and while it was popular with a small sect of (mostly USA) expats, it was not exactly a travel hotspot. It was certainly popular with the younger Mexican hippy type crowd. It is a very magical and culturally rich place.  \n\n\nI'm looking forward to travel in Central Asia and Caucasian countries later this year. I'll be going to other places but I think those are some of the lesser talked about areas when it comes to travel.",

The things is I've heard some embassies are notoriously difficult. I met an American there who had half of his party stay at home because their applications were denied. Some embassies also ask for letter of invitation I've heard, but that's easy you just need to pay an Algerian  tour company and they'll issue it for you.",

In rural Bulgaria, they want to ask you what you think of their country, find out why you came there for vacation, tell you the cool places to go, and make sure you have a good time in their country.",

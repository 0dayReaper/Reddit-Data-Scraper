    "postText": "Hi! I'm a Japanese person just doing online school looking at different countries I could visit within the next 3 months. (the more inexpensive ones) and I'd love to hear an outside perspective onto why I should choose one of these countries. I'll mostly be studying inside my apartment and walking around the city/gaming. (I don't spend a whole lot of money. My budget per month is around $900 USD.\n\nSo far, I'm debating between \n\n\\- Vilnius, Lithuania\n\n\\- Warsaw, Poland\n\n\\- Tallinn, Estonia\n\nI'd love to go to Czech or Germany as well, but they are just a bit too expensive compared to these, I think. (At least Prague is.)\n\nTrying to spend around 200-350 on a studio in the city. (Or near it)\n\nThanks!",

Here\u2019s some [apartments/rooms](https://www.kv.ee/search?deal_type=2&amp;county=1&amp;price_max=350) available in your price range in Tallinn \ud83d\ude2c. With 900\u20ac you\u2019ll manage but it won\u2019t be enjoyable imo. Summer is beautiful here tho\u2026\n\nNevertheless if you have questions about Tallinn you can ask me :)",

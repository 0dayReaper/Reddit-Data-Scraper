    "postText": "Going to Vietnam for the first time on August 15. Will be there for 14 nights. I already have my ticket and am flying into Saigon and Flying out of Hanoi. I don\u2019t really have any plans other than making it up to Hanoi to fly out. This is what I\u2019m thinking and would like opinions from those who have gone. \n\nDays 1-3: Saigon\u2026 just explore the city and it\u2019s cuisine/people. Would like to do a trip out to the Delta. \n\nDay 4: fly to Da Nang. I want to explore Da Nang and hang out on the beach and also go to Hoi An and get a suit. I can stay there a night or just go back and forth between the two. I know it takes a few days to get a suit so I figured I\u2019d do like 4 days in this area. \n\nDay 8-14: Fly to Hanoi. I\u2019ll be in the Hanoi area for 7 nights. I\u2019d like to explore the city and eat lots of food and maybe do a Ha Long Bay cruise, or go up to Sapa. I\u2019d really like to do a Sapa homestay but I\u2019m dealing with a hip/knee injury and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to do the day long hike through the mountains to get to the homestays. \n\nAs you can see, I really have no plans and really I just like to explore, eat, see some sights/temples/landscapes\u2026 I\u2019m open to all kinds of suggestions. I\u2019m pretty well traveled but have not yet been to Asia. Also welcome anyone who wants to join if you\u2019ll be around. Thanks!\n\nAlso: I welcome any accommodation suggestions. I prefer hotels. I\u2019m 37 and have no desire to be staying in any dorm rooms, though I am a pretty hard partier so open to suggestions with communal atmospheres. \n\nAlso also: ASIDE from lodging and tours, I would like to keep my daily spending at about 70USD (1.6 million dong). So that would just be for food/drinks/fucking off. Is that doable?",

            "comment": "This has pretty much exactly what I\u2019m doing now - in fact, I\u2019m on my Ha Long Cruise right this moment!\n\nHere\u2019s my take:\n\n3 days in Saigon - good amount of time. Saigon is a busy, overstimulating city. Sidewalks are non-existent - either overtaken by motorbike parking and restaurant sitting space. You\u2019ll walking in the street along traffic a lot. Crosswalks with lights are few and far between. Be prepared. If it\u2019s your first time or first stop, it can be a lot, but it can be great! The night life is good (check out LeFe rooftop bar!), as is the food. 3 days is a good amount. I spent the same amount there and it was more than enough for me. The spas are awesome too. \n\n4 days Da Nang - good amount of time, I stayed 2 days, not counting travel days, and I wish I could\u2019ve stayed longer. It\u2019s my favorite out of the three big cities. Catch a food tour for some really good street food, too. I would really think about what your travel style is here. DN to Hoi An can be a 35-45 minute drive, and while they doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, the time adds up, and so does the money ($15 each way, so $30 roundtrip - almost half your daily budget). \n\nIf you want something more quiet, but still with a great city center, stay in Hoi An. The beaches there are remarkably uncrowded (check out \u2018Hidden Beach\u2019, not so hidden, but when I went mid-may there were very few people. I could sit on the beach with no one around me for like 75 meters. \n\nIf you\u2019re more into the city, and like things to stay open a bit longer, stay in Da Nang. The beach there is a lot more active and crowed, and when I passed by it looked more like Miami Beach, whereas Hoi An was more Carribean style, quiet beaches. But if you\u2019re into cafes, restaurants, and nice hotels, do DN. If you like homestays, quiet, and local businesses, go to Hoi An. From there you can set aside a day to visit the other city. \n\n7 nights in Hanoi - good amount. Hanoi is a bit different from Saigon. Whereas Saigon is a literal Mario Kart track, Hanoi is much more like a walking street with bikes in it. At night many of the streets get blocked off so people can walk around. The shops are nice and so is the food. It\u2019s best to stay here the longest. I\u2019m staying at the Central Backpackers Hostel, and the private room is nice, and big. Even better than the 2/3-star hotel next door (i stayed there as well and then walked the 10meters to Central). Plus the staff helped me book a Ninh Binh tour at 12am for the same day! They can get you Ha Long Bay and Sapa tours as well, and I think they run a party HLB cruise. They also do nightly barcrawls, which was pretty rad - but pretty short. Barcrawls in Bangkok are hardcore, but in Hanoi most things are wrapping up come 2am. \n\nAs for Ha Long - absolutely do it! But heads up, if you do a 2d/1n Cruise it can kinda get a bit lonely. You\u2019ll be surrounded by couples and groups. Which is fine in a city when you can kinda do your own thing, but a cruise not so much. I\u2019d get a party cruise next time. The normal one is lovely, but lonely - which i usually hardly feel. \n\nThat\u2019s just my two cents! If you have a day definitely do Ninh Binh.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for taking the time to write this. A few things:\n\nAs for the Hoi An/Da Nang part: what I\u2019m most concerned with here is being able to get my suit in Hoi An. I just graduated law school and take the bar in July and that\u2019s actually what this trip is celebrating. I start at my firm when I get back so I really don\u2019t want to leave Vietnam without the suit, both because I\u2019ll need it, and for the experience. \n\nSo, I really like the idea of Da Nang. I love resorts and busy beaches and I hear Da Nang has a great food scene and food is my primary interest in this trip. I was thinking stay in Da Nang and go to Ho An a couple times to do the suit. BUT I also don\u2019t wanna be traveling between the two every day so perhaps I\u2019ll fly into Da Nang, go to Hoi An, go to the Tailor, stay in Hoi An, wake up in Hoi An and do the second fitting, go to Da Nang, fuck around in Da Nang for a couple nights and maybe go back to Hoi An and pick up the suit? Then go back to Da Nang and fly out to Hanoi? I don\u2019t really know how to work it to be honest. \n\nSo, about Saigon. All of the things you\u2019ve said about Saigon is why I\u2019m only staying 3 days. To be clear, that is not to suggest I run the city only deserves 3 days. BUT I only have 2 weeks (down from my original month) so for Saigon all I really wanna do is just get a feel for the city, see the War museum, and check out the delta - and do a food tour. If I like the city then I\u2019ll make more trips to Vietnam and be devoting more time to North/South separately. \n\nHa Long Bay - I really wanna do this. I actually wanna do the Party cruise with Oasis Bay or whatever but I\u2019m having a hard time getting in touch with them. No problem waiting until I get there but I wanna make sure they have a spot. Also concerned because I\u2019m 37 and I\u2019m sure everyone on there will be young. I\u2019m also open to suggestions of any of the other bays as well. \n\nNinh Binh- when people mention this are they talking about the Province as a whole or the city? What exactly is there to do? \n\nNational Parks - have you done any of these?",

But if you can\u2019t, 3 days is fine. I HIGHLY recommend going to Ha Long Bay - truly one of those sights you have to see in person, photos and videos will never do it justice. I was so shocked when I went, it literally took my breath away! Your budget per day is also plenty of money. Some days you may spend more if you\u2019re buying souvenirs or something but you probably won\u2019t even spend that much everyday. Unfortunately I can\u2019t provide any accommodation recommendations because I always stay with family lol but you\u2019ll have an amazing time there!",

So sitting for long periods aggravates it (as does waking uphill and downhill) but I\u2019m trying to rehab it with PT as much as possible this summer before I go. \n\nDid you have a driver?

It's actually a really great tactic and I even use it for getting through 12 hour shifts but somehow I never turned it around and thought about using the same strategy for solo travel as a challenge.\n\nMy mental strength is fairly high, but my irrational and catastrophic panic is as well. Despite that, now that I'm back in Australia living my mundane life, I'm so determined to get back over there alone and show myself I can do it (provided I'm free of tumour and seizures are controlled).

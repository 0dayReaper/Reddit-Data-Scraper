    "postText": "Recently approved about 2 weeks off for the summer, so my planning is last minute and hoping to act fast (book flight by end of week). \n\nI (US, NYC) am thinking of going to Europe. Here\u2019s my rough idea:\n\nBarcelona (4 days)\n\nMadrid (4 days)\n\nPorto (2-3 days)\n\nLisbon (3-4 days) \n\nHow does this sound? I don\u2019t mind cutting a city if I should spend more time in one\n\nMy other idea (Plan B): \n\nVenice then immediately go to Dolomites to hike (5 days)\n\nGreece (9-10 days) - have family here, been many times  \n \n\nI like museums, parks, food, hiking, pretty much everything. Not into night life so much \n\nLast thing. \n\nI\u2019d be buying the flight with miles, which right now would be about 80,000 round trip. For you personally, is that many miles worth the trip? Curious to hear opinions. Thank you!",

            "comment": "The awkward part is getting from Spain to Portugal. Getting from Madrid to Porto is either [9 hours of trains or an 8 hour night bus](https://www.rome2rio.com/map/Madrid/Porto) (or a flight, but if you are flying, you might as well go anywhere).\n\nTo salvage this plan, consider adding Sevilla. It's one of Spain's top cities, a *fast* train ride from Madrid, and puts you in better position to get to Lisbon. Then you can finish in Porto. A couple options:\n\n - [Via Sevilla and the Algarve](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=barcelona$2$r~madrid$3~cordoba$0$e~sevilla$2~lagos$2$r~lisbon$3~coimbra$0$e~porto$2$r&amp;trans=Train&amp;nights=14&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;), one of Europe's most beautiful coastlines, a 4-5 hour bus ride from Sevilla, and then a 4 hour train to Lisbon.\n\n - [Via Sevilla and Evora](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=barcelona$3$r~madrid$3~cordoba$0$e~sevilla$2~evora$1~lisbon$3~coimbra$0$e~porto$2$r&amp;trans=Train&amp;nights=14&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;), a cool university town 1 hour from Lisbon and a 5 hour bus from Sevilla.\n\nAnother possibility is just to cut Portugal and do Spain on it's own. 14 days is plenty of time to see almost all the top sights, and to do so really efficiently because of Spain's excellent AVE train network.\n\n[Here is an optimized Barcelona to Granada in 14 days](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=barcelona$3$r~madrid$2~toledo$2~madrid$2~sevilla$3~cordoba$0$e~granada$2$r&amp;trans=Train&amp;nights=14&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;) itinerary that essentially substitutes Sevilla, Granada and Toledo for Lisbon and Porto. IMO that's a good trade, but it's even better when you consider how much time you are saving: it's only around 8.5 hours of travel time *for your entire 14 days combined*. In other words, less than just the journey from Madrid to Porto you are currently considering.",

If you\u2019re open to it I\u2019d just replace it entirely with Seville which I felt like there was more to do, see, and imo had the best food between the 3 main Spain cities. \n\nMadrids not bad but Seville and Barca are just more interesting",

For you personally, is that many miles worth the trip? \n\nIt's not the greatest points redemption ever, but it's far from the worst. Whether it's worthwhile depends completely on how much the trip would cost in cash, which miles we're talking about exactly (e.g. Chase? United? American?) and what kind of mileage stockpile you have. By that, I mean: would this burn the majority of the miles you have, or do you have enough for the next several years of travel regardless of whether you use them here?",

I always have 2 weeks off in December, so could start planning for a trip at that time instead. What are your thoughts?",

IE I looked at flights to Norway with my united miles and it was going to be 80,000 miles. Instead I booked a flight to London for 30k miles and bought a flight from London for $100!",

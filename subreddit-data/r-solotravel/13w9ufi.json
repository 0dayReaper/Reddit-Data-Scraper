    "postText": "I love traveling in all forms, and I frequently spend time abroad. Sometimes I go with friends, usually I go with my long-term partner, and rarely I go alone.\n\nI have a 2-month break from work coming up and I really think it\u2019s time for another solo trip. It\u2019s been years and I\u2019ve only done a few short weekend getaways since meeting my partner almost 10 years ago. I\u2019ve wanted to do some sort of international trekking for a while and this seems like the perfect opportunity. I was originally considering the Camino (and still am), but I might instead prioritize something else with a shorter time commitment like Machu Picchu.\n\nThe thing is that my partner really wants to take the time together. They can\u2019t get anywhere close to 2 months off from work, so I\u2019ve suggested that we start or end the trip together, and I can do my solo trek before or after - but they\u2019re really uncomfortable with that idea. There are tons of places we could go together but my partner isn\u2019t at all interested in a \u201ctrek\u201d or long term hike.\n\nSo - how do you decide when to travel solo, or when to travel with other people? Hoping to keep this question more open-ended rather than getting into relationship advice for my specific situation :)",

For instance, I\u2019m going to Germany this week with my partner for 12 days - we both aren\u2019t able to spend that long in Europe, so 12 days works for both of us and will leave us both happy. On the other hand, I want to spend the summer between my Master\u2019s and Bachelor\u2019s backpacking Europe. My partner works full time and can\u2019t get that much time off, so I\u2019ll be doing it solo. It depends on whether or not you think you\u2019ll be satisfied with a shorter trip and whether or not that shorter trip aligns with what you truly want.",

Could you think of it as wanting to do two trips in those two months? \n\nIt sounds like you are happy to both, and both solo travel is a priority as is getting away with your partner. You want to hike, that could be a great solo trip. Your partner does not, are there things you both would be happy to do? Maybe it is a beach holiday at the end or beginning of a solo trip, maybe it's you going off for the first month, go back home and then go away with your partner at the end of your holiday.\n\nThose are some practical aproaches, I think there is also a relationship part. You will also need to talk to your partner about what you want out of this trip and listen and adress why they are uncomfortable and what they fear, as you likely already know.",

            "comment": "Personally for a long-term partner, my partner (well now ex but not because of this) always gets an invitation if it's a trip I'm planning. \n\nSo if I was going on a trip with friends or otherwise by myself, I'd almost always invite them. But if it's a friends trip for example, another friend planning a birthday trip for a weekend - it depends on what they want (stated or not). \n\nWe were also comfortable enough that it wasn't uncommon that they'd be okay with me going alone (or with other friends) or only joining in part. It's just whatever makes sense. Sometimes it's just not logistically feasible (especially with short notice trips). Sometimes I would suggest hey, let's go to Rome this weekend next month - if he had a friend's birthday dinner that weekend and wasn't all that keen on Rome, all good. I can go on my own. Same with friends - if you're not free, and don't mind - I'll go or go with someone else. \n\nAnd sometimes it's about the experience you want. The Camino - my friends offered to join me but actually I wanted to do alone - and personally am glad I did. I'm not all that religious but it is a centring experience I think to do alone and have extremely long periods of time to be alone with your thoughts (or often best with no thoughts) and no distractions except for one foot in front of the other. I met a ton of people on the way too that I had incredible chats with that I don't know if I would've been equally open on with people I 'knew' around too. On the flip side, I did Santorini on one trip and while it was great, I do wish I had gone with my partner. It's a romantic place and it would've been a nice time away. \n\nI think it all depends on the type of trip, and the type of trips the friends or partner are interested in and avialable for.\n\nBut with partners, also what works for both of you. I know you said you didn't want relationship advice and I wouldn't presume to give it to you - you two know each other better than strangers on the internet. But I think it's worth talking through what the concerns on. From a very short message, as much as I'm someone who values some independence a lot in relationships, I can also see how someone wouldn't necessarily want their partner disappearing for weeks (or months) at a time.",

Go for a few weeks at a time so you\u2019re not neglecting your partner too much.",

I personally travel solo when I want to go on a trip but no one else wants to come or is available. But I probably wouldn\u2019t hike on my own because I\u2019m accident prone. Haha. I think the Camino is pretty safe but I don\u2019t know about Machu Picchu, I believe that\u2019s a bit more taxing. \n\nI would think you travelling on your own before or after the couple trip would be perfectly reasonable.",

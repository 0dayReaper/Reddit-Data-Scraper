    "postText": "I will do a 2 weeks trips through those countries also Slovenia, Croatia  and maybe Bosnia. I will travel alone by car and the big issue I see is that my car might be stolen. I decided I will always have the car key next to me. The key has the option to remove a only mechanical key from it. So the electronic key I can lock into the car and hide there and then I have the mechanical key I can do in my swimming trunks (I will get some with zipper baggage). But I see still the problem that criminals could just destroy the window and steal the car. I heard that in those countries stuff like this happens quite often.\n\nLoosing my car with all that stuff would really be a disaster but as I am alone I might be an easy target for criminals. Are there any more tricks to avoid car theft? For example removing urgent engine plugs and so on. Any ideas welcome on how to deal with the situation. For most the time I will wear a belly bag with key, passport, credit card and phone but what the situation I want to swim in the sea.",

If wikipedia is to be trusted, car theft is 10x more probable in the US, UK, etc as compared to these countries.\n\nPetty theft is a more likely, but still improbable, scenario. For that mainly keep things hidden out of sight if you can't take them with you.",

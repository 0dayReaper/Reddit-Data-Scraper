    "postText": "hello. First of all, I would like to express my respect to all of you who have traveled all over the world alone. You are doing a really hard and honorable things. I didn't know it would be this difficult.  \n\n\n  \nI am a 25 year old Korean male and this is my first overseas trip. I came with the goal of visiting almost every country in Europe, and I now realize that was a very dull goal. I bought a 3-month Eurail Free Pass and am traveling in Europe. I started in Norway, went through Copenhagen, Hamburg, Amsterdam, and Paris. I flew from Paris to Lisbon and then to Porto. Can you believe this trip was all done in 10 days? I walked and walked without stopping for 10 days. I walked an average of 10km a day, and the most I walked was 20km a day. With a 13 kg backpack on. (If you look at the number 13kg, it doesn't seem like a big deal, but one book usually weighs about 1kg, so it's like carrying 13 books.) I lost my weight about 5kg in 10 days.  \n\n\n  \nThanks to this rigorous travel, I was able to visit many tourist spots in a short period of time. At first, I enjoyed to this travel, but now it doesn't. Tired and wanting to lean on somewhere or someone. A few days ago, I suddenly felt lonely.  \n\n\n  \nI've stayed at several hostels where travelers gather. There was something like a bar there and travelers could share a community. At the first hostel I visited, I started a conversation with other backpack traveler. I was confident because I have the magical power to attract people. But the reality was different. Their English was too fast and hard to understand. Every time I say \u201cCan you speak again?\u201d I asked again, and the conversation stalled each time. When people gather in groups and talk, I couldn't raise the timing to ask back. I just sat still and pretended to understand the flow of the conversation. My face expression inevitably darkened, and I didn't want to discourage their mood, so I left the community and had some time to myself. Keep going. The same goes for other hostels.  \n\n\n  \nThat's it. I haven't get the words out of my mouth for the last 3 days. I have wanted to learn English, but I think now I will forget even Korean haha.  \n\n\n  \nWhen I woke up this morning, I walked again. European cities are very different from the Korean cities where I lived. It was new and beautiful for the first few days, but now everything seems to be boring. No matter which city i go to, they all have similarly old and large cathedrals. There is a pretty park and people are lying on the lawn. Now it's a boring repertoire. I dare say I'm bored of it. Still, I can't stop walking. If I'm not even walking, what am I doing here? At this point, I feel like I'm not walking because I want to, but I'm forced to. Because it's the least meaning I can make.  \n\n\n  \nWhile walking in a park in Porto this morning, I saw a peacock roaming freely on the sidewalk. It was so fresh and enjoyable because, So far, I've only seen peacocks sleeping in cages. A lot of people were having fun and taking pictures. I also took pictures. People talked about peacocks with their friends next to them. \u201cIs it a lot bigger than I thought?\u201d , \u201cI think they are telling us to get out of their house\u201d and so on. But I kept my mouth shut and just took pictures. I was just like, \u201cWow\u2026 \u201d was all I could say. At that moment, I felt great loneliness.  \n\n\n  \nI am writing this at the train station in Porto waiting for the train to Vigo, Spain. In Vigo, I will be staying in a hostel again and I will envy the English-speaking groups. Maybe i would lament saying \u201cIf only I had been born in an English-speaking country,\u201d. Then I would go to sleep and wake up in the morning to walk around Vigo, Spain. And again Madrid, Barcelona, Marseille, Switzerland, Italy, Greece, Germany, Poland.  \nAddendum 1)  \nI wrote a little pessimistically, but I want to clarify that I do not want to scatter complain. Please do not blame me for not being fully prepared for the trip. It's just how I feel right now. I think it's pretty clear how to solve my problem now. Practicing English a lot on YouTube. Eliminate boredom by studying the history of Europe and feeling the story, not the outward sightseeing.  \nAddendum 2)  \nI know that many travelers make friends with smartphone apps. But I'm not good at it. I want to meet real friends, not online friends. So I have to say let's meet, but it's hard to get the word out. Maybe it could be interpreted in a bad way. Before that, I have to form intimacy with that person just by chatting, but I don't want to look at my phone like that even in Europe, which is thousands of kilometers away from my home.",

But is that really what you find interesting in travelling? I do a lot of short term travel because I go somewhere for work and then attach a couple days or so extra to sightsee, but even in short stunts there's only so many churches I wanna see lol. \n\nTake a break for a few days, sit down at a cafe and people-watch, maybe do a small hike with a packed lunch and just sit there and watch the view, find a hostel with a bar and hang out there for a couple evenings, or even book a couple nights in a hotel or private hostel room and watch Netflix. Do something different than just ping-ponging the top-10 tourist spots in town and moving on. \n\nKorea's one of my favorite countries to visit, and I've visited a few times for 3-4 weeks at a time. There were many days where the main activity was just sitting by the river drinking soju, or finding a specific dish. Don't rush so much.",

Yeah sometimes you got to take a step back from being a traveller and just start living a normal life, as if its a place you have moved to as suppose to just visiting. It just brings you back to your comfort zone and helps you relax.. Finding a specific dish is a particular favourite of mine, just spending a day looking for the best spots, trying the different delicacy's can be a very rewarding experience. Also to not put pressure on yourself to make new friends, for me that is always just a bonus and i don't actively pursue it because the disappointment of not being able to connect with others can be so demoralising. It can be paradoxical but when you're not really too fussed about meeting new people, that can make it easier for you to make new friends because there's no desperation in your interactions, you come across as natural and authentic and people gravitate towards that.",

Constantly changing cities and just speeding through major tourist attractions means you never get to experience the local culture or get familiarity with anything or anyone. That mode of travel can feel very impersonal and isolating when you are alone. \n\nIf you stop and chill out in one place, you\u2019ll get more immersed in the area and the people. Go back to the same restaurants/bars/cafes for a few days. Stay in guesthouses or smaller hostels where there is a nice host and smaller crowd of people you can chat with one on one. Big groups in big social hostels may be more difficult to break into with the language barrier and constant churn of people in a group. \n\nGo on walking tours, usually they are a good way to meet people. Find paid excursions (like hikes, rafting, biking, etc), they can also be a great way to spend a day talking to the local guide and the group of people you are with.\n\nYou can also meet people online who will meet up with you on your trip. There are infinite ways to do so on subreddits, discord groups, WhatsApp groups, Instagram, Facebook etc. Just find the ones for the city or country you are in.",

There are only so many cathedrals, art museums, and baroque architecture you can experience before you grow weary. \n\nSo, OP, my advice to you going forward is to keep setting goals for your travels. Find a reason to travel, such as a personal interest or theme to your trip. For me, it's hiking and getting out into nature. This is something I never frow bored of. I also try to sample as much of the local cuisine as possible and do food tours.

But you're there now, slow down and take places in, you'll gradually find your travel style, interests and ease into it, then maybe meet people as well.",

Maybe the suggestion of other posters here is good, slow down when you find a city you like, and just stay a full 1 week in 1 city.  Try to find all of the interesting things you can find, find new ways to connect with people, there are many ways. Eg, hang out at some cafes, go on some group tours, walking tours, chill out in other places where people are more likely to be happy to chat with random people. Obviously not always simple, but you can try.  Personally I've really enjoyed solo travel more when I settle down for a longer period of time in one city - are there any activities there you can also enjoy there that you enjoy back home . Eg, if you liked to play Chess back home, go to a chess meetup. Or if you like to play Bocce ball, go find a game of bocce ball in the neighborhood.  Can try to do this for whatever interests you have outside of travel.",

Sometimes this was a cafe or a park. I would also make sure to listen to my body and when I was even just a little tired , thirsty or hungry I would stop and look for a place to rest right away. \n\n\nAs a solo traveler I was never able to stop feeling \u2018lonely.\u2019 I think I felt even more lonely when I saw families and friends traveling together and having fun.

Something I try to to do when I feel down while travelling is to reflect and practice gratitude for what I've experience. \n\nTry journalling, some quick guidelines I use:\n1. What did you do today?\n2. How did it make you feel?\n3. What was memorable?\n4. What did you enjoy?\n5. What was challenging? \n5. What did you learn / what will you do differently next time?\n\nFortunately for me, English is my first language but I've been lucky enough to connect with others from other cultures where a common language was limited. Something I noticed is that people are always keen to connect when in new situations. Try whipping out a card game (my go to is UNO), or go for a drink (people are always happy to have a laugh when alcohol is involved), or maybe embrace your culture make observations how what you are experiencing is different to what you are used to. If you open up and make yourself vulnerable, people will take care of you.\n\nStay safe mate and wishing you all the best!",

            "comment": "I think you need to slow down!\n\nYou have a 3 month rail pass, which means you should be taking your sweet time in each place before moving to the next. The pace you're travelling at is too fast, that's what people do when they only have 2 weeks to see all of Europe, not 3 months!\n\nTravel doesn't just mean walking everywhere all the time! Travel means sleeping in sometimes, sitting at a cafe and enjoying a coffee for two hours watching people going by, sitting at the park reading a book and enjoying the sunshine, sometimes getting takeaway and watching a movie before going to bed. It should be enjoyable. It also means when you get to an attraction, you can spend some time there enjoying it rather than rushing to the next place. By walking all the time you're pushing yourself too far and tiring yourself out. If you slow down, you'll get more of those peocock moments where you come across something interesting. You'll also see that each city is different and unique. They feel the same to you right now because you're going through them too fast.\n\nThe other tip I can give you based on experience: it will always be hard to talk to a large group of people in your second/third/fourth language. This is because if everyone there is familiar with English, they'll start talking quickly and use slang and it will be hard for you to keep up. Don't take it too personally, it doesn't mean that you don't fit in, and most of the group probably don't realise they are excluding you.\n\nInstead, if you want to practice your English, talk to people alone, or a group of 2 people. One of the best ways to do this is to ask someone to take a picture of you, or offer to take a picture of them. Example: if people are taking selfies with the peacock, offer to take a photo for them. This almost always leads to a conversation, like \"thank you for the photo, are you travelling alone?\", \"yes I'm doing 3 months in Europe\", \"oh wow that's impressive where are you from?\", \"I'm from Korea, this is my first solo trip\", \"Oh I want to visit Korea, have you been to blah blah...\". That's how a lot of these conversations go and they are excellent for talking to people and practicing a new language. You'll feel a lot better too when you feel that the local people are friendly.\n\nAlso there are days when I'm solo travelling where I don't talk to anyone for a few days. It's okay, it's only temporary. Soon you'll be back home and you'll wish you didn't get too upset by it.\n\nFinally, don't wish that you were born in an English speaking country! Instead you were born in South Korea and you're fluent in Korean, which is just as impressive. Your written English is already great, and you'll get to practice speaking during this trip. Don't worry about it too much, it's great that you know a second language. \n\nI hope this helps! You have 3 months. Don't overthink it. Just try to do what makes you happy and enjoy it. Don't do something because you're forced to do it. The 3 months will pass either way, so it's up to you to make them fun.",

Instead of seeing your millionth cathedral, try doing something unique to the area (example - polar plunge and sauna in Norway) you'll be able to interact with even more people this way, and it's different from the everyday drudge of walking through museums and parks. \n\nNow is a great time to reassess your wants and needs while traveling. It sounds like walking has become incredibly bothersome, so why not spend a day relaxing on the beach in Greece or doing some group wine tastings in France. Joining activities will definitely help to meet new people in a setting that sounds good to you. You're still human, and going going constantly is unsustainable so make sure to take time to relax and rest even if this means sitting at the hostel scrolling through tiktok for an hour",

My foreign student aid at work told me that it is easier for him to speak my language with other foreigners than with us natives as we speak too fast, are lazy with the pronunciation etc.\nI've practised my German on poor sales people, few other tourists from German-speaking countries or just other tourists that speak German. It is difficult to follow the conversation in large groups, so go small. Seek out other solotravellers or couples e.g. at caf\u00e9s or hostels - just say, \"Can I join you?\" They rarely say no but seem to enjoy unexpected company, and take a no with a smile, then others may invite you. OK, I acknowledge that there might be a difference between a young man and a grey haired woman. But still, try.\n\nI hope you find the joy of travelling again.",

            "comment": "When you are going away for a few days having a packed schedule is a great way to make the most of your limited time. Plus you can rest when you get back home. When you travel long-term you need to treat it more like normal life. Stay a bit longer in each place and slow the place. Have a lazy morning and then sightsee in the afternoon. Do some normal things like visiting the cinema. Have a day when you just do laundry, chores and admin. One good thing about staying a bit longer in one place , especially if you know the language, is that you might find a community event or one-day workshop you can attend. A friend of mine has been to art workshops all over the world.",

Taking your time at a cafe to draw what you see around you or read or knit. It sounds like you're bored BC the way  you're traveling is actually quite boring. Stop hopping and start slowing it down. Get to know a city rather than breezing through. Go to the same cafe more than once so that the server recognizes you and gives a genuine hi. Stop following the herd to all the cathedrals and just wander, going to what piques your interest. Take a free walking tour so you can get more insight about the things you see rather than going and taking a pic and leaving to the next. \n\nI just got back from Montreal. One of the best days was when my data ended and I just walked back to the hotel instead of taking the train. I randomly saw a few opera singers practicing. I found the perfect picnic spot to chill in the shade. I stopped into a Japanese bakery and watched an old dude make beard candy. If I had followed an itinerary I wouldn't have seen any of this. Let go a bit and you might actually enjoy things again. Good luck!",

I remember at the beginning of learning how to listen I'd watch a whole YouTube video (20-30 minutes) and I'd only start to understand what they were saying by the end of it. It's almost like I needed to get used to people's individual accents before being able to fully understand them. When it's in real life, there's an extra layer of difficulty which is the background noise. Real people also don't speak as clearly as YouTubers or actors. If you're in hostels, it's likely you will find other non native speakers which will have accents you're likely not prepared for. I have no advice here, just wanted to say your experience is normal and it's ok to be frustrated, we all have to go through it.",

That\u2019s exhausting and when you get exhausted on a solo trip the loneliness sets in. As other have said, stop moving and sit still in a nice city. Do things that make you happy - spa? Sleep all day? And then go to a nice little local restaurant and tell them you would be really happy for them to make whatever food the locals eat and drink. There is such a local food pride all over Europe and your wiliness to accept their dining suggestions will bring a more familial result which should help your loneliness. \n\nPlease post more here if your loneliness doesn\u2019t get better (or if it does) we have all been there. Try to embrace it but you are not alone if you have the interwebs.",

            "comment": "As someone who recently traveled to Europe for 3 months, I can say that slowing down and staying in some places for a longer period of time will be a blessing. When I slowed down I had time to sightsee but also just go chill at a caf\u00e9 or park and just chill which made me feel so good and less burnt out. For example, I did 13 countries in 3 months, and from what I've read, you have moved through 6 countries in 10 days meaning that you have really not had a true break and have not spent much time in many cities. Just remember as well that travel days no matter how short or long the journey is can be tiring too. It will also help you better connect with travelers if you are moving around less. This is because you will potentially have a few days to explore and meet new people instead of always moving around which is when you meet fewer people. Also many travellers besides checking out new sights also enjoy going to eat in a park or market, checking out a new bar and other things that you will actually have energy for if you move around less.\n\nAlso taking breaks to fuel your body will allow you to feel more energized overall because losing 5kg that fast doesn't seem so great.",

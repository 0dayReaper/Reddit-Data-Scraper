            "comment": "Hi, Native Chicagoan here. Your TIMELINE for everything is okay, but I think you have quite the lackluster and downtown centric itinerary. The Loop (downtown) is awesome, but the heart and soul of Chicago is in our neighborhoods and easily reached via biking, walking, or public transport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The Big Starbucks is incredibly overrated imho and there is going to be a massive line. I guess this is not time completely wasted though, as the views are great walking up and down Michigan Ave (The Mag Mile) where this is located.\n2. Try and Bike up Milwaukee or take the Blue Line and check out Wicker Park and Logan Square (where I live at the very least) Tons of cool restaurants, shops, and bars. Check out the big and beautiful Humboldt Park and Lagoon here as well! \n3. I love Pilsen and Bridgeport. Such a good vibe for walking around. Get a nice view from Palmisano park in Bridgeport. Walk down 18th street in Pilsen for such a cool vibe and good Mexican food.\n4. DO NOT MISS Chinatown. Easy to reach from both the neighborhoods above and the Red Line from downtown. I never get sick of Chinatown! :)\n5. Good choice on Lou's. Get the butter crust. Lou's is wayyyy better than the tourist shit Girodanos\n6. When Downtown, on Mag Mile, Go and buy a drink from the Signature room. It is located at the 95th floor of the Hancock building. Way better than the touristy Sears tower sky deck imho as you can actually see the Sears tower with the skyline view here",

I am not a fat ass btw ;)\n\nPalmisano Park is not even edgy and it is close to downtown and Ricobene's. If i were to recommend true off the beaten path non-touristy places I enjoy going I would've mentioned places like The Pullman national historical district, Calumet Fisheries, Jackson Park, and The Garfield Park conservatory, but places like this are truly a bit out of the way for OP's 4 day trip.\n\nA trip to Chicago with only Downtown and the god awful bubble of Lincoln Park planned are a massive waste of a trip to our great city, especially if OP has no plans to return soon",

Divvy bikes are everywhere, and the red line is very easy and can be paid for with tap to pay credit cards or Apple Pay. \n\nThe Hancock building bar (96th floor) or London House have the best downtown sunset views of the city. Hancock for views of the whole city (north side). London House for the best river walk sunset. Both are free to visit, but always a bit of fun to get a (priceydrink. Best way to see the city from above imo.\n\nArchitectural boat is a must, so good call. Adler and Shedd are right by each other, so I\u2019d think you could easily do both on the same day. \n\nThe beaches along the lake shore are nice to visit if the weather is nice (North Ave is the largest on the north side while still somewhat downtown and easily reachable by bike).\n\nIf you can go to Starbucks mid-day on a week day, there won\u2019t be much of a line, and you can fly through it in less than an hour even if you\u2019re the biggest SB fan in the world.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never been to Chicago, swinging by the Bean, Grant Park, and Buckingham Fountain are \u201ctypical\u201d additional touristy things to do (for free), and they\u2019re all nearby a lot of the other things you\u2019re doing. Cindy\u2019s Rooftop is a great spot to get a birds-eye view of the park.\n\nAs a few others have hinted at, deep dish isn\u2019t the true Chicago style pizza. Tavern style originating on the south side is. However, deep dish is a classic tourist thing, so go for it. Lou\u2019s was my favorite of the big three growing up, but I\u2019ve switched to Giordano\u2019s in the last couple years for when I have friends visiting. (And really it\u2019s Chicago\u2019s, Art of Pizza, or Pequod\u2019s)\n\nIf you\u2019re into drinking, Three Dots and a Dash in the Hubbard Street bar area is a fun speakeasy underground tiki bar. Pricey, but the drinks and atmosphere are cool. There\u2019s also some bars along the riverwalk and at the various beaches. Not sure if they\u2019re open yet as I\u2019ve been out traveling for a bit.\n\nMapping all of these things out might help make sure you\u2019re not going back and forth too often. Four days is plenty to see what you want plus a bit more with some planning.\n\nAs I said, I\u2019m out traveling myself for a while longer, but feel free to DM if you have any specific questions. Chicago remains my favorite city in the world (to live).",

From the ground level you can barely see the rear of the ship (the part with the \"chimney\"..idk the right word) sticking out of the water. So seriously amazing shot. It really is an incredible beach - you can catch oysters, clams, and mussels just snorkeling. Some of the best local restaurants actually catch fish, squid, and octopus in nearby beaches too. Yeah Potamos is stunning.. it's also a protected wildlife refuge, so on the way to the beach you can even see wild flamingos and pheasants too! ;) Thanks for posting!! But just a heads up to people going here.. there's also a lot of dangerous underwater currents on the tip of the small peninsula called \"Fanari\" beach (I hear people drowning or disappearing almost every summer). This beach with the sunken ship is only like 10 minutes walking from the Fanari beach peninsula tip. So be careful!!\n\nBtw, how did you get to Epanomi? Did you rent a car, or did you take the bus from Thessaloniki to Epanomi?",

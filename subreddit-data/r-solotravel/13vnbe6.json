    "postText": "Hey guys! This is my very first reddit post, please bear with me if anything! After reading through numerous previous posts filled with amazing advice, I couldn't resist sharing something of my own.\n\nJust today (30th May 2023), I arrived in Singapore from New York. During my last weekend there, I met someone through Bumble. We had the opportunity to meet twice, and it was truly special for me. Our first meeting took place in Central Park, where we enjoyed a lovely walk amidst the lush greenery. He even brought a bottle of wine, and we sat down to have a great conversation. Despite his shyness, he had me laughing a lot. As the conversation started to dwindle, I mustered up the courage to ask if he wanted to kiss me, joking about the potential awkwardness.\n\nSecond day of the evening, we met again at his apartment. He was kind enough to take me for a walk along the riverside near his place before we headed back. Even at his apartment, he never pushed me to do anything. We simply watched a movie and shared more kisses. That night, we engaged in deep conversations, with me asking all sorts of quirky, childlike questions, including discussions about superpowers. He listened attentively and provided genuine responses.I left his place at 3 am and caught a flight back to Singapore that same night. \n\nHowever, I can't seem to get him out of my mind. I found myself listening to the song 'Enchanted' on repeat during the flight, reading the books he recommended, and jotting down detailed notes about our time together. I understand that crushes formed while traveling can sometimes be unrealistic and overly romanticized. A friend of mine told me that it will pass, but I can't help but think about him. We exchanged WhatsApp numbers, and I texted him expressing how enchanted I was to meet him. He replied, expressing his joy at our connection and how much fun he had as well.\n\nI know it may sound crazy, but the idea of returning to NYC this year just to see him is constantly on my mind. I'm aware that my emotions are currently overpowering rationality. I would greatly appreciate hearing your stories or any suggestions you may have. Thank you all!\n\n**\\[edit\\] Thank you to everyone for your overwhelming support!** I'm truly grateful for the incredible answers and advice I received in just a few hours. I want to provide some additional context: he's actively dating other women, and the only reason I got to meet him was because one of his planned meet-ups got cancelled (he was honest about it). However, I don't believe his dating others would affect my feelings towards him or my willingness to see him again. **Having a crush on someone is often a deeply personal experience, even if it's not reciprocated.** By the way, the flight from Singapore to New York City is the longest direct flight in the world, spanning 19 hours! You're right though, I should trust my heart and instincts. I plan to **wait for 1-2 weeks to see if my feelings remain the same, and then I'll communicate with him about potentially meeting up again, even if it means flying over to NYC.**",

And get to listen to some great music (I mean if you haven't sung along to Everybody Knows with bitter, staccato clarity yet, can you even be said to have lived at all?)",

I worry that I might just be one of his casual dates, and the thought of scaring him away really concerns me.",

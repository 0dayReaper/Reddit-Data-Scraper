    "postText": "34M (USA) currently in week 7 of a 10-week European trip, and **really** enjoying myself! So much so, that I'm highly considering \"moving\" here, or more accurately, doing the \"Schengen Shuffle\" bopping around the Schengen countries for 90 days, then going someplace *outside* the Schengen zone for 90 days to reset my timer. Ultimately, I'll likely look into either an education or Digital Nomad visa, or worst case, find a new job and get a working visa - but until then, doing the shuffle is the plan.\n\nI've heard &amp; read very promising stories about the Balkan countries as a viable option to reset my timer, but have never personally been to any. Alas, I'm reaching out to this amazing community of experienced solo travelers to get their opinion(s) on the best countries, and cities/towns within those countries to accomplish this.\n\nIdeally, I'd really like to center my search around a few **critical** priorities:\n\n1. **SAFETY** \\- Obviously nobody wants to be the victim of a crime, but losing an iPhone to a pickpocket is **much** more tolerable than being mugged or stabbed (or worse). I realize there's no guarantee of safety anywhere in the world, but generally, which places do you find to be the \"safest\"?\n2. Cost - The cheaper the better, but willing to spend a little more to satisfy #1\n3. Fast, reliable internet - I'm a Software Engineer by trade and **require** good internet, plus I'm a gamer\n4. Amenities - I'm no longer in my 20s, so I don't care about a super active nightlife, but a few basic amenities would be nice so that I'm not stuck inside all-day, every day. Golf courses (are those a thing there?), pubs (**BIG** beer fan), *maybe* a cocktail bar or 2, a gym to workout, few restaurants, etc....simple stuff like that would suffice plenty. I'm easy!\n5. Less \"tourist-y\" - While I'm *capable* of tolerating denser populations, I prefer living a much more quiet lifestyle. Plus, with the European train system, it's pretty easy to go somewhere else for great sites &amp; attractions. That said, I'm not trying to live in a village with 100 people \ud83d\ude04\n6. English-friendly - Currently, I only speak English, and know that wherever I end up, I'll need to learn a new language. That said, if any places happen to speak more English, great! (that likely knocks out #5 \ud83d\ude05)\n\nI'm definitely willing to compromise in some areas, **especially** to maximize #1, but I *feeeel* as though what I'm looking for isn't *terribly* over the top...just a nice, quiet, safe place to settle into for a few months with good internet &amp; some basic amenities. Though I could be gravely mistaken and/or naive, who knows?! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nExcited to hear your thoughts, and thank you in advance!!\n\nTLDR; Where are the **safest**, affordable places that have good (ideally, great) internet and basic amenities in the Balkans? Brownie points if they're English-friendly!",

I used [https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/visa-calculator](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/visa-calculator) **and** [https://www.visa-calculator.com](https://www.visa-calculator.com/) and it lets you re-enter after every 90 days.\n\nWhat happens is on your exit date, i.e. when you're leaving the Schengen zone, the rule looks backward 180 days and sees you've only stayed 90, b/c you took off 90 before re-entering. I popped in the following dates into the calculator, and all looked good.\n\n3/18-6/15 (90 days): looking back 180 days from 6/15 exit is 12/22/22, so only stayed 90 in the last 180.\n\n90 days later...9/15-12/13 (90 days): looking back 180 days from 12/13 exit is 6/16, so only stayed 90 in the last 180, b/c we left the day before 6/16 last time (on 6/15)\n\n90 days later...3/15/24-6/12/24 (90 days): looking back 180 days from 6/12/24 exit is 12/15/23, so only stayed 90 in the last 180, b/c we left two days before 12/15/23 last time (on 12/13/23)\n\nRinse &amp; repeat...\n\nYou could also do this by reversing the math for entry dates. Re-entering on 9/15 (2nd date range above) - 180 days = 3/19. Stayed 90 from March to June, then reset the timer outside from June to Sept.\n\nPer the site above:\n\n&gt;The 90 days you are allowed to spend in the Schengen zone are eligible for a 180-day period. This period is commonly referred to as a \u201c**rolling** **timeframe**\u201d because it\u2019s constantly moving\u2014 each day you spend in Schengen advances your 180-day period. This period is counted backwards from your most recent entry or exit dates. So, let\u2019s say you enter the Schengen area on July 1, 2022; you count backwards for 180 days from this date and calculate how many days you have spent in the Schengen area during these 180 days. If you\u2019ve already spent 60 days, you have another 30 days left.",

Yeah i think renting a car is the best way, especially if you want to go hiking in the mountains and provides flexibility if you want to go to the caves or to the capital city, etc. It\u2019s really pretty to drive around too. It\u2019s also an extremely safe country (I say as a solo female traveler).",

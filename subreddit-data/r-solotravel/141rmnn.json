    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nBeen solo travelling in Europe before and about to embark on Australia soon but have a question.\n\nSeen different group tours like from Happy Travel and Ultimate which all look good and a good place for social interaction. However I would like to do it on my own but don\u2019t want to risk the chance of losing the risk of lacking social interaction. I plan to do a lot of the excursions and stay in hostels but from experience, do any of you recommend the group tour or not?\n\nAny advice is appreciated\n\nHappy travelling! Thanks!",

Cos you will meet lots of ppl in hostels but if you want to travel from a-b it\u2019s a case of finding the right person. I waited 1 month in Perth to go north. But that\u2019s Perth. In Melbourne it was quick to find someone going to Adelaide. And imagine east cost will be easy to find someone. I did a tour of Tasmania and uluru as I was limited on time there. But everywhere else I just winged it!",

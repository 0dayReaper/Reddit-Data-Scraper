After making friends with some fellow traveller's, they got me alone and stomped on my chest a bit and stole a few hundred US cash. Went to the hospital and have a few bruised ribs and some back pain. Not serious, but I'm depressed and I'm dwelling on negative self harmful thoughts. Why me? I didn't deserve this. The whole trip is now overshadowed by this. This was supposed to be a chill diving trip and now I feel like humiliated, ashamed, and stupid. I hate myself for falling for it.\n\nEdit. Anyone wondering, this was around Khao San road. They said they were from Uzbekistan. Three guys and a girl. We made nice nice at a bar and hung out for a few hours. We walked around a bit, the girl reached in my pocket and grabbed my cash, then screamed bloody murder when I tried to get it back. The guys knocked me over and kicked the shit out of me and took off.",

You all have a vested interest in each other and can be tracked down fairly easily should someone try to pull anything.",

One of the best things about foreign travel is being with a strange people in strange places. To be open to new experiences and to learn to see other ways of behaving and being - without the judgements of your own background. \n\nPart of that means you are particularly vulnerable to being tricked or lied to or taken advantage of because the indicators of shadiness vary so wildly from culture to culture. The other part is of course the wild magic of the unexpected. \n\nI wish the takeaway from violence was more like, \u201csome people are just going to be shit.\u201d Not, \u201cstick to hanging out with people from the same hostel who are likely in similar socioeconomic classes and who are probably traveling in the same way.\u201d Although the latter may be safer. \n\nFreedom has inherent risk. But responding ti violence with Tips and Tricks on How to Stay Safe isn\u2019t the right thing. The fault is with the doer of the violence. And this idea that being smart and taking clever precautions will render you free from harm is such a weird belief. It provides false comfort to the bystanders that they, through the power of Good Decisions, can avoid shit outcomes but lacks any respect for the sheer randomness of the universe. \n\nI\u2019m sorry it happened OP.

Like, I get your perspective and if it works for you that\u2019s awesome.

I didn\u2019t get hurt one bit and I only lost 40\u20ac, they were even nice enough to give my wallet with all the cards back to me. Total joke of a \"robbery\" if you think about it. Still, the humiliation of it angers me to this day. I honestly don\u2019t know if I\u2019d recover from something like what happened to OP psychologically. I\u2019m a quiet and friendly person who wants to believe in the good in people, and when something like this happens, it shatters my whole world for a while. The risk is not just that of losing money or being physically hurt, for me, the risk is losing trust in people for multiple weeks. I can either make friends with people in my safe, boring comfort zone, or I can risk getting so fucked over that I never want to make friends with a stranger ever again. I prefer the former.",

I would just give the classic advice for that city, always be aware of your surroundings, trust your gut if it feels like rough area. Keep your belongings in a safe place on you. I usually try to avoid being out super late anyway, while I'm solo travelling but that's more of a personal thing.\n\nMost of the areas you will spend your time in Prague will be quite touristy so lots of people should be around.\n\nEnjoy it though!

            "comment": "I'm so sorry that happened to you, or to anyone. That's the action of severely impoverished people -- very deficient in the soul, so alienated from humanity. They do not have happy lives, and they will suffer from what they did to harm you physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually (inciting dark thoughts and hopelessness).\n\nI'm afraid that your path will not be as simple as 'just ignoring it', 'just getting over it', or 'just not thinking of it'. This was violence and trauma that was experienced very directly. You were targeted, betrayed, robbed, and beaten. I'm so sad with you.\n\nBut though you may have to find support and healing for yourself and for your better nature, the event itself is over. The damage has stopped. And you are reaching out and talking, so your healing has begun and you are showing up for yourself.\n\nHowever despondent you might feel, see that you are already taking steps of healing. And see that you *want* return to integrity, you *want* to have faith in goodness, you *want* to find the light. In this, you are already far more fortunate than your attackers. They live outside of the light. They have given up a great deal of faith. Their lives are sub-human. Money can't help them.\n\nSo I hope you don't add your own self-harm to their attack. Don't let darkness darken you, but know that however much darkness is around you, a single light can dispel it. There is brightness within you that is beyond the reach of shadows; it can't be touched, can't be attacked, can't be harmed.\n\nDo what you need to do to be safe and take care of practicalities. File police and insurance reports, call friends and family for support, get yourself home safe. If you're still in Thailand and needing help, ask about travelers' services at the hospital or at a hotel concierge, or contact your country's consulate.\n\nThen it's a time for healing and a time for grief. I don't think you can just forget it and move on. Even if you experience tremendous, gut-wrenching grief, it is appropriate. You don't have to go looking for dramatic emotions, you don't have to perpetuate thoughts and memories of the event, but you do have grieve. It makes you human. You have experienced loss on a number of levels -- as we all will -- and you have encountered in a very raw way the harshness possible in life and the poverty that exists in humans. This is a matter of grief. You can help yourself by allowing it, not by immediately trying to put on a different face.\n\nGrief is a human skill; you can get better at it by doing it. And you can turn harm into benefit by learning from it and changing based on what you learn.\n\nIf you notice your mind or behavior turning to the worse, reach out to those who can help. Friends and loving ones themselves enjoy a special kind of benefit when invited to help. And if you get stuck on the healing path, perhaps bogged down or repeating negative patterns, look to those more expert in healing trauma, be they wise ones within your community or religion, or expert counsellors or therapists in the field of trauma.\n\nYou're still here, and I am glad. You can use this event to wake up. I'm glad about that too. Good luck.\n\nBe aware on your way home.",

There is no need for you to have hundreds of dollars in USD on you in Thailand - it is pointless to carry ANY USD on you during a night out in Thailand.\n\nIf you're an American or European, walking around tourist trap areas of South East Asia (a continent most Americans and Europeans are novices in) waving around a months salary in USD in front of people you don't know... it is slightly risky. Most Americans wouldn't do that in say, Mexico, and most Europeans wouldn't do that in Albania - but there is a false safety in being REALLY far away from home.\n\nBut on the other hand, and this is the MOST IMPORTANT thing, you learned an incredibly valuable lesson about trust and self awareness and all it cost you was bruised ribs, some back pain and a couple of hundred dollars.  The important thing is to actually learn from it and don't take it personally. \n\nHere is why they did it - opportunity and planning:\n\nThey saw a mark, and made a move. They thought \"here is a nice guy from a foreign land with no backup and with a huge amount of disposable income and he is casually showing it off\" \n\nThey then figured the girl in the group could probably just snatch it and get away, and if you make a scene or go to stop her, the guys have all the reasoning they need to \"save the girl\" and beat you into not resisting. They planned the whole thing that way **so that a witness or police would have to choose who to believe** \\- the four of them or the one of you. They tell the cops \"This aggresive American/European started groping our sister/gf/whatever\" so we defended her - and its four peoples word against one. Numbers game, you showed a high value opportunity by carrying that cash in that currency, and you had nobody watching your back.\n\nAt least they weren't Thais - you would have been put in a coma at best.",

Please only read the comments that are helpful to you and stop reading the ones that shame your pain or invalidate your experiences. Not everyone who has gone thru hard times can empathise. Some who are willing to still be good people can, others can't. Some just don't have the necessary sufferings to be able to understand hence the ignorant comments at times.\n\nDon't take any of this personally. Everyone is just sharing at their own level of understanding of themselves and their life experiences. Not everyone will be able to understand what you've been thru.\n\nPlease do seek help after you head back to your country. And especially speak to trusted others who can help you process what happened. Let your emotions out. They are important for you to stay sane. It was brave to travel alone. I am doing the same too. And only seeking out the ones who are trustworthy. Relying on our intuition is also important at times like these + learning from our experiences. \n\nI personally avoid huge crowds with a lot of people unless I'm with someone else I trust. Otherwise, I won't go to those places alone. I also don't drink so that's not a necessity for me.\n\nThere are always pros and cons to every situation and choice. Again, please take care of yourself and know that it truly isn't your fault. Ho'oponopono, blessed be.",

I can understand one shit person but not a whole group. \n\nI had this one time. I was in a hostel. There were 5 other guys in a group and me. At 4am they turned on the light. I was like ok. But than they start packing and talking like it\u2019s normal. After an hour I\u2019m like what the heck. So I told them. The small one told me \u201cshut up, you\u2019re in a minority here\u201d they all headed up to me and told me to be quiet. I was still like what the fuck is this. These type of humans actually exist. It was real demotivating and humiliating as well. \n\nThere are really some shit stupid people on this planet. I just can\u2019t believe that they can act like this. Like what are they feeling? And I just come to the conclusion that they function on a lower level of consciousness because they see everything as a fight or a struggle. How can they actually relate to others or build a relationship. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re not that type of person. Because it\u2019s just suffering and not a real life but coping with their own insecurity. \n\nDon\u2019t be bothered too much by them you\u2019re above and beyond it",

I didn't even realise it was fractured til two weeks later when the swelling died down to reveal a big ol' dent, but it's had a lasting impact on my health (more frequent headaches, worse sinus issues, often get pressure headaches while flying now, may have had impact on my teeth). A doctor originally planned to open my head up to reinforce my cracked skull with a metal plate, but eventually decided to wait and see if it could heal on its own.

As always, a reminder that for people struggling with mental health, solo travel is not a substitute for professional help--and that the stress of travel (unfamiliar surroundings/languages, culture shock, lack of a support network) can sometimes exacerbate these issues.

It sucks and it's perfectly understandable that in the immediate aftermath, you'll be deeply upset with yourself and maybe even feel that some failure or inadequacy on your part invited this to happen.  That feeling is natural, but unless this is your first trip abroad or you're just a hopelessly naive person, that's definitely not true.  Solo travelers are inherently at risk for being victimized and it can happen to anyone.\n\nSome people don't want to admit that because it makes them feel uncomfortable so they blame the victim to reassure themselves that something like that wouldn't happen to them because they'd be better or smarter somehow.\n\nThanks for sharing your story though.  I think doing so can be part of a healthy process to cope with this experience.  Once you've gained some distance on it, you should find that your feelings of shame and humiliation will fade.  While it may feel now that this trip has been ruined, once the shadow of this event recedes, all the high points of your trip will remain as they were in your mind before it happened and the memories of them will bring you joy as they did before.",

These assholes are the ones who did wrong, not you. Shit happens. You were in the wrong place at the wrong time. I\u2019d recommend talking with a counselor if you don\u2019t bounce back. \n\nYou are awesome for trying new things! Only ships that stay in harbor are completely safe.",

You are the victim and it will take some time to process that.\n\nI know alot of people here always talk about making friends while traveling. I do not ever consider anyone I met traveling as a friend, at most we are acquaintances in a similar place with similar a purpose.\n I use precautions around everyone. I watch my drink and I don't get drunk, I lie about my job,  I don't expose my money. I don't follow people to secondary location in places I'm not familiar with. I'll even take a selfie with them in background and send it to my fam. Alot of times if they're up to no good, that will dissuade them. Just some of the things I do, I'm a woman so I even more cautious.",

I would suggest you to keep talking to other fellow travelers because they will understand you better than non-traveler friends and do not let this experience overshadow your entire trip. Also do not let this experience take you on a negative swirl. The world is a decent place but bad things happen.\n\nOn a positive note- be glad that you are safe and sound.

I had an experience that left me feeling embarrassed and all those other feelings you mentioned and then I started training mma. 13 years later I\u2019ve had 12 fights ( 7 amateur and 5 pro ) and no one fucks with me now. You don\u2019t have to compete obviously but you should train. Start training and you will always have a choice in those situations rather then feeling like you are in over your head, but don\u2019t let this get you too down because things like this happen to us all at some point.

    "postText": "I have LOVED solo travelling but recently got a 9-5 job (after graduating last year) and seems like it's wired my brain differently now. I'm at the airport (connection in Paris) and all I can think about is work (which I don't even enjoy btw) and not one bit thinking about the trip which I find so strange... I want to feel how I'd feel before - nervous/anxious/excited about the trip. But ever since I got into the corporate world my life has been so dull and overly consumed with work and it's all I think about. \n\nOf course I still love solo travelling, but not as excited/nervous as I used to be - part of the fun of trips is also just anticipation bit... \n\nAnybody feel that way sometimes/any advice on how to literally separate work/holiday? Might sound like a silly question and I can't believe I'm at this point lol.",

The key is learning to separate your job from your actual life. When I feel the exasperation associated with my profession I have to remind myself that my job is but a facet of my identity and it is NOT who I am. \n\nSetting expectations with your employer/coworkers can go a long way. If you typically receive daily correspondence from your place of work I would recommend stating an approximation of the time frame you will be gone (I personally give an approximation vs exact date as I prefer a day or two of down time at home before returning to to my place of work). Clearly state you will not entertain any work-related nonsense during the given time period unless the issue is absolutely imperative. If the company you work for is not up in flames due to your absence then they have no reason to contact you nor do you have any responsibility to respond.\n\nThis may seem counterintuitive as a solo traveler but slowly wean yourself from social media/technological dependence before disembarking. Your electronic devices are a greedy reminder of pressurized obligations that quite frankly detract from the experience of a solo trip! Set notifications to \u2018do not disturb\u2019 and be amazed by the freedom your mind has when it is not being assaulted by objects of feigned importance. \n\nLastly, be kind to your psyche. Solo traveling can be exhausting and lonely at times. Utilize this time to reflect/indulge on aspects of yourself that are often neglected due to your corporate lifestyle. \n\nBe who you are suppose to be unapologetically and all else will fall into place. You deserve this trip!",

I still have Instagram, but I haven't posted anything travel related on it for years. I had a habit of using those story albums as a sort of shared journal, but then I used it less and less, and now I never touch it. \n\nI find it much easier to disconnect and be present at whatever moment I'm in when I'm not hooked on those apps, thinking about what to post next. (Note: I'm still taking photos and videos, I'm just not motivated to share them on social anymore. They're really just for myself to reminisce and reflect back on.)",

When I travel I'll set an autoresponder, change my status to away on Slack, and make sure everyone I work with directly knows I'm going to be away. Then, I shut off all work-related notifications and try to force myself not to even peek at my inbox so I don't have any new things to obsess over. It's only work and everything can wait!\n\n\nI find that once I get to my destination, the work thoughts seem to die down and not matter that much - I'm way more focused on what I'm going to see today and how I'm going to get there, and most importantly, where I'm going to eat, haha.\n\n\nAs for the excitement and anticipation, I really love spending my evenings/weekends before the trip doing my research about the destination and making plans. Basically, life can feel kind of empty if I don't have a trip to plan. But since I travel a lot (I take mostly short trips), I guess the excitement at the mere thought of traveling isn't there as much as it used to be, but that's okay. I don't think it's job-related, just normal when you do something a lot.",

I think this is normal if you're a responsible adult and are likely juggling a 'things to do' list and a few hundred other conversations and things in your head. \n\nIt also gets a bit complicated if you are friends with your coworkers outside of work, and likely are in some group chat where they're whining about stuff.\n\nUsually it takes about 1-2 days for me to get out agenda-mode and start experiencing stuff outside of my routine and fall into the travel style I used to like. \n\nWork enters my thoughts every once and a while during my trip, but that's usually because there's something I see that tags back to whatever is going on at work. I don't think there's anything wrong with this, but hopefully you're thinking about these moments in an amusing way and not as a stressful/I-need-to-add-this-to-my-agenda way. \n\nIf you have friends from work that you keep in touch with during your travels, then they'll likely keep work stress out of your chats (Or if they're not doing it on your own, just mute those chats until you're back).\n\nTL;DR: Don't worry about reflecting back to your job during your vacation. Work is a *huge* part of our lives, it'd be insane to wipe it completely from our minds. But leave those stresses/things to do from your care once you're off. Recognize that the world will move on, and the cogs in the company will keep turning without you; Delete any apps/emails or work related access from your personal phone, and enjoy your trip!",

            "comment": "I think that what you are experiencing is pretty common.   Before graduation, most of us had jobs that we weren't terribly invested in - they were a means to an end, earn enough money to get by, but that's it.  Once you start working in jobs related to a career, you are naturally more invested emotionally and mentally in what you do.  A lot of it has to do with increased responsibilities, having ongoing projects that you are working on, thinking about what is coming down the pipe, etc.  That means that it can be harder to switch gears out of work mode and into vacation mode.  \n\nIt used to take me several days to get out of work mode, but this is something that I have actively worked on and now I am pretty good at switching gears.  A big part of it is just redirecting my brain - when work thoughts come in, I actively think about something else - push the work thoughts away and replace them with something else.  After a while, the work thoughts just stop intruding.   I also have a ritual that helps get me into vacation-mode:  when I leave work to start vacation, I get in my car, I roll down my windows, turn up the music, and as I drive away, I yell out at the top of my lungs \"So long suckas!\" Then I hoot and holler as I drive away with the wind in my hair.   It's silly, but it makes me happy and it works.  It helps with the psychological transition from work brain to vacation brain.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, I feel like this will be a genuinly silly question but I cannot find any advice anywhere on Reddit or the actual Hostelworld website so please forgive me for asking. \n\nSo far, I have only used AirBnB, where you pay, the charge leaves your bank account and that is done. Paying on Hostelworld, they take a part of the overall price from your card straight away and say that the rest is 'payable on arrival'. Does this mean the rest of the price will leave your card once you arrive? Or do you pay again using your card/cash depending on the hostel policy? Will you only pay this (reminder) amount, or will the hostel ask you to pay the full amount (including the small deposit charge you paid when booking)? \n\nSorry for so many questions, I just wnat to make sure everything is sorted and I do not stress once I arrive (first time travelling solo)!",

That\u2019s definitely not a silly question! \n\nThe way hostel world works in my experience is they take the deposit from your card and then the remaining amount is payable on arrival to the hostel with either card or cash. Keep in mind that in some cases, depending on what part of the world you are travelling in, the hostel may only take cash. \n\nIf you open the app and select \u201cTrips\u201d, then select the hostel you\u2019re booked in to under coming soon and then select \u201cbooking details\u201d it should have a breakdown on how much is payable on arrival :)",

This also includes the commission that HW takes. However this doesn't include the city taxes, so guests need to pay us the city tax by arrival. Seems to be common in Europe but I didn't know this until I came here. \n\nThe second is what we call a normal booking. Here you're basically only paying the Hostelworld commission. This is like the payment for making the booking through them. \nYou need to pay the remainder to the hostel (room rate and city tax) on arrival (the commission is deducted from the price). \n\nDepending on the policy of the hostel, you can pay the remaining balance by cash or card. \n\nI hope that helps. Have fun on your travels.",

A week later they took out an amount of Z from my account which was more than both X and Y.\n\nAfter contacting them and lots of email exchanges, turns out that the \"tax\" they list isnt included in their price and they actually add it \"secretly\". So basically making you think you pay less but then charge you more. Nothing I hate more than crap like that but not much I could do post fact. Lesson learned.\n\nBut to answer your question, they took out 1 amount straight away, and the remainder 1 week after (the stay isnt till July this yer).",

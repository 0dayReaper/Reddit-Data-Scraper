    "postText": "I'm writing this with tears in my eyes, holed up in my room. After spending all this money and dreaming of this my whole life, I really want to leave and I had that this trip feels wasted. I'm a pretty experienced traveler and I've NEVER felt this uncomfortable before. Hopefully this helps someone who is in the planning stages.\n\nI quickly realized after arriving that there are hardly any other solo travelers here. Everyone is either in a couple, family, or with a tour group. So it's very hard to meet people. I tried striking up conversations with a few couples but it was clear that this was more of a romantic get-away for them and they weren't interested in socializing with others.\n\nIn addition to having a hard time meeting other travelers, I learned that not having many solo travelers means, as a woman, you REALLY stand out. The Galapagos has a very small population, so there is a small dating pool for the local men. And the constant \"attention\" (I would say harassment is more accurate) makes me very uncomfortable.\n\nWhen I say I feel unsafe with the local men, I'm not talking about the typical street calling you see in a lot of South American countries. I'm talking about hostel/hotel owners, tour guides, and agency owners being very inappropriate.\n\nAt first, I thought \"wow this tourism agency owner is so generous with his time! he's showing me around the neighborhood and everything.\" And then, of course, it got weird. He started getting touchy-feely so I said I had to run to get dinner. I go to dinner and he somehow finds me there and joins me. He has my number from my booking form, so he texts me countless messages that night asking to go out again.\n\nThen on a day tour, I was harassed by two different tour guides. I was the only person on the tour who wasn't fluent in Spanish and the only person not in a family. So I was singled out quite a bit and pulled away from the rest of the group. One of the guides tried to show me this cave when we were snorkeling. I'm so glad I said no as he kept touching my waist and trying to \"help\" me in and out of the water even though I was clearly able to do it myself. He also started texting me that night asking me to go dancing with him. The only reason he had my number was because he was supposed to send me photos from the tour (which he didn't).\n\nLater that day, I was snorkeling somewhere else, when a different guide grabbed me by the wrist and started pulling me with him to show me some animals. I was already struggling as my mask was loose so I kept trying to pull my hand free so I could stop, but he was too strong and didn't seem to understand. He brought me really far from the rest of the group. I don't know what his intentions were because the next thing I knew he was gone and I was left to fend for myself. I was too far for the rest of the group to hear me and the current started getting really strong. I found myself stuck between two rocks and getting thrashed around. I eventually made it back with scrapes and cuts all over my legs. He grabbed my shoulders and asked if I was ok. I couldn't believe that I was put in such a dangerous situation by a company I was paying so much money!\n\nThen yesterday, on the beach, I was sitting in the sand and a man sits right next to me and starts leering at me as I put my sunscreen on. Everytime I looked with the corner of my eyes he was staring right at me. This was a huge beach with many places to sit. I was so upset that I couldn't even enjoy the beach in peace that I just left.\n\nToday, I moved to the second island of my trip and I was so excited to get away from these guys. I checked into my hotel and everything was going smoothly. When I stopped by the front desk to ask a question, the owner asked if I wanted to go for a walk tonight. It could be innocent, but I think it would be naive of me to assume that after all of this and go on a walk at night with a stranger. I said \"maybe\" but have no intention to. But my room is right next to the front desk and I just feel so awkward and I don't want to go back out there.\n\nSorry, I know this is a bit of a rant. But I wish I had known this beforehand and I would have shelled out more money for a group tour where I felt safe. Or at least waited until I found someone who wanted to travel with me.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks everyone for all the love and wisdom! This got way more attention than I expected so I can't respond to everything, but wanted to answer some questions that came up a lot. That said, I want to as much as possible keep the attention on this warning to others rather than on me. I will be ok :)\n\n1. There is a woman who has the front desk for the night shift so I do feel better about that. I will put furniture in front of the door just in case and look into other options for tomorrow night.\n2. A girl I met on the mainland contacted me and said she's here so I just met up with her. She's going through similar experiences so it was nice to vent and relate and I think that we can, for the most part, shield each other going forward by sticking together as much as possible.\n3. For those asking about what tour agency I used. I went through Ocean Paradise, but I should mention that- like a lot of the day tours here- they don't personally run them, they just book them. The girl I met went on the same tour (with the same tour guide) but booked through a different agency.\n4. For those saying that they know of people who had great experiences while on multi-day tours- that's exactly my point. I don't really consider that solo traveling since you're not alone, but that's what I wish I would have done and recommend if you don't have anyone coming with you.\n5. Yes, I did stay in a hostel for the first three nights, but I was the only one in the room until the last night and I left 6am the next day. Maybe it's particularly dead for solo travelers right now? The girl I mentioned is staying in a dorm room now that's also empty.",

The boat crew is so clueless that when a fellow passenger was busy drowning, it took ppl in the water screaming for too long to get the crews' attention. Meanwhile, two young ladies who weren't strong swimmers started drifting away from the boat. I saw that and took their hand to swim back to the boat. I'm a decent swimmer, but moving 3 bodies against a light current is still stretching my limit a bit. I was relieved by the time I made it to the ropes. That was one of the most eventful boat trip I've ever taken, I still haven't complete digested that advantage.  But that's a story for another day.\n\nI guess the point is, when we travel, we look out for each other. Don't be shy asking for help. There are creeps out there for sure. But there are good guys/gals too.",

We got her back in the boat and a rotation of people performed CPR non-stop for over half an hour before medical help arrived. \n\nPeople doing the CPR claim that they don't feel a pulse the entire time. We thought she's a goner. But the 7 Island tour resumes the regular scheduled event and started heading to the next island! Miraculously, we got a call and photos on the boat showing us she's revived at the hospital. To this day I'm not sure what I saw. It's not like I felt the pulse or saw the picture with my own eyes. But her friends and family on the boat who didn't make it on the medical boat seem to be satisfied. \n\nThe ridiculous part is that we went on to two more islands and a sunset dinner. Followed by a night swim in bioluminescent algae. If near drowning in daylight is any indication, night swim should put people on alert. The crew for once stepped up. They put out a rope and ask everybody to hold one. This one Russian family decided to swim out in 3 different directions. Sure enough, fun's over and everybody got called back into the boat. \n\nOn the swim back to the boat, the family yell at the crew for cutting their swim short. The rest of the boat yelled at the family for acting like idiots. A lot happened on that boat trip. I'm still not sure how I feel about impromptu local tours.",

A few females on the chartered boat  I was on were single and traveling from Europe (unknown to each other) I think the Netherlands and Scotland or something also\nSome Canadian girls and none spoke Spanish but since we were all english speaking, we ended up bonding and hanging out for about a week. Ended up being kinda an impromptu singles gang. Guess I got lucky. Maybe try to find some younger travelers. May have more modern values.",

On a practical level, I'd encourage you to ensure you are safe in your hotel room (especially if a worker/owner showed interest). No joke, I tend to move furniture in front of the door before I can comfortably sleep. Don't forget, many workers have keys to your room. I don't mean to scare you but to remind you to do all you can to keep safe until you're in a better situation. \n\nDo you have access to wifi? Can you look up group tours for the rest of your trip? How long are you there? \n\nAnd MOST importantly: could you please check in with the sub and let us know you're safe every day? If you need to, send a private message with your location and itinerary so someone knows where you are. It's important when you're alone to not ever be \"off the radar\".",

I completely understand why she said \u201cmaybe\u201d and it was probably the smarter choice.",

There\u2019s nothing in the post to suggest she was in fear for her life while checking in to the hotel and had to cooperate in order to survive. She was nervous, yes. But firmness and directness are highly underrated by women, especially in situations like these. She will communicate strength by clearly replying \u201cno\u201d and leaving it at that. If she wants to soften the ego blow, then \u201cno, thank you.\u201d \n\nHe doesn\u2019t control her living situation; she can go elsewhere.

I even went out to a karaoke bar one evening and stayed out quite late but I was with a group of fellow travelers from the hostel.

So maybe Ecuador isn\u2019t *quite* as safe as the rest of SA and I just got lucky?\n\nI did have a similar experience to OP in the Galapagos.

Get an underwater camera and immerse yourself to be the next photo pro.  You still may get hit on by the rogue single male diver but the odds are less than if your on a cruise vessel.  It can be awkward around the dinner table just as much for a single male as it is for a single lady but as a diver you all share a single interest and the chance of the hanky panky you described would be less because. you spend lots of time underwater and the. social dynamic is different.

Depending on the location, most of the time you can decide to go off on your own if you wish, or stay with the group. Plus, most of the travelers are other solo women or small groups of female friends that are always willing to welcome another. \n\nAlso, I have learned the phrase \"I'm sorry, but I am a lesbian\" in at least 9 different languages.

We booked a snorkel trip and were the only two people on the boat with a guy. He took us away from the other boats and I ended up with his hand between my legs in the water after he insisted I hold a nurse shark. I quickly swam away from him and refused to go near him. When we got back, we reported him to the owners of the snorkel expedition. My friend almost got raped by a \"friend\" who worked at the timeshare one night. She fought back, punched him, and luckily the owners of the timeshare immediately fired him. Men were so gross and leering everywhere we went. Ever since then, I will not go solo to anyplace that might be like that. I mean, women are not necessarily safe everywhere, but that was so scary. Please be careful, and report.

            "comment": "That is a horrible experience. I recommend researching sites such as womentraveling.com. And to all females out there, if you see a solo female on your trip, just check on them to see if they would like to hang out. My sister and I travel together, we were on a group tour to Egypt, on our way there, we met another woman who was on the same flight, going on the same trip, she was travelling alone as her friend had cancelled at the last minute. Sis asked if she would like to travel with us and she was much relieved as we had to navigate connecting flights etc. We have maintained our friendship with her, even though she lives in a different city, it\u2019s been 20 years! Take care of yourself OP, do your research, be safe. \n\nhttps://womentraveling.com/travel-calendar?gclid=CjwKCAjwi6WSBhA-EiwA6Niok1LbQGwCjIl0ZFB3hibRuopewKTNlxLVSVWddckKYzds3RW5nDAMmBoCzesQAvD_BwE",

I went with intrepid, I'm an independent traveller, alot of the people drove me mental asking what shoes to wear each day and not being able to think for themselves... but it did mean I knew the people I was traveling with around the islands and had a certified tour leader  to see the sites as the number of people in areas is limited and like you said the towns are so small and survive on tourism alone. \n\nDon't let it get you down,  I was cautious everywhere I went and never let people know if I was single or alone. Every now and then there are people who are quite aggressive with their approach and we can be too nice trying to diffuse the situation if we aren't used to it",

My tour operator was very inappropriate and I left a review and told the company I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with him stating passive comments. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you, make sure you post on TripAdvisor and if you can, reach out to the tour company directly, this guide needs to be removed.",

I just joined this group because I wanted to hear stories from other women who have the courage to travel alone. You're still incredibly courageous for taking all that on. I'm sorry that they ruined what would have otherwise been a lovely trip for you. Please press charges if possible and stay safe.",

Places in mind: Easter Island &amp; some of Patagonia, Antarctica, open to other suggestions?? I just have a feeling they aren't solo backpacker friendly and going to run into couples like you said (Galapagos was also on my list to do with someone but clearly you agree best not done alone!) It's sad we can't enjoy certain places alone, but unfortunately this is how it will be in some places.",

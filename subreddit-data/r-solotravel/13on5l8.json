            "comment": "Hey, I'm currently going through Japan solo for 4 weeks, focusing on the countryside, exactly what you're planning. I'm 1.5 weeks in and I've spent that time in Hokkaido so definitely felt the isolation.\n\nHere's some points to note:\n- yes there will be days when you haven't spoken a single word all day except hello and good morning  \n- similarly you'll feel as though you haven't had a good conversation in a while because no one speaks English\n- you definitely get used to it more and more as time goes on. It's roughest at the start \n\nI'm an introvert and like isolation, but the part of the isolation that affected me was not being able to have a good conversation with anyone at all for days on end. \n\nMy coping strategies:\n- I started posting everything on my Instagram stories. All my thoughts and random musings. I think it happened naturally because I needed to share my stories with someone. What happened was people I hadn't chatted to in years were responding to my stories and I suddenly had lots of interesting (digital) conversations going on as I travelled which was a HUGE help. It felt like I was surrounded by people\n-  sometimes if I was tired and once when I was sick, I called either my mum or my brother and had nice long conversations with them. Results may vary if they are busy, but if you have someone you can call that helps\n- I downloaded some good shows before I left home. Yesterday while eating a late night dinner in my room, I started watching one of those. At one point I was so invested in it that I forgot I was in Japan for a short while. Then it hit me where I was and it felt great to know I was here doing something I loved. English TV gave me a short much-needed break\n- Similarly I've downloaded my favourite music as a point of familiarity when everything else is different.\n\nStrategies I am yet to try:\n- buy a notebook and write down my thoughts and experiences. I think this is similar to sharing my stories with others, a way to document what I've been up to and clear the mental slate for the next thing\n- Reading a book. This should provide a break when needed the way TV would.\n- be more understanding and accepting of myself knowing that if I'm tired, I'll feel alone. Making sure I get enough sleep and eat on time so that I have energy.\n\nA lot of these coping strategies I have developed from my time working on oil rigs where you're surrounded by people but often feel more isolated than ever. You just need some reminders and touch points of home and that will ease any loneliness you might feel. \n\nAlso I feel more isolated in Tokyo than I do in the countryside. Just bear in mind you can still be lonely while being surrounded by people. \n\nDM me if you'd like to stay in touch. I'm sure I'll learn more as I get further along my trip",

            "comment": "I\u2019m 2 months into a trip like this in Japan right now, and I generally stay away from cities/go towards nature for similar reasons at this point. Generally what I do is go out of my way to book hostels in bigger cities every once in a while while I\u2019m passing by the area. I feel like it gives me just enough dose of other people to want to be alone again afterwards. I do think loneliness as a solo traveler on a long rural trip is somewhat unavoidable, but breaking it up into smaller sections helps. Plus, it sounds like people in this thread are doing/have done the same thing, so maybe consider using Reddit to do meetups when you pass by big cities, or find people staying for longer periods who you can see multiple times if you wrap back around the area. I personally met someone off Reddit who I hung out with in Tokyo when I was passing through briefly, and then saw them again when passing through Kyoto a week later.",

So my advice would be to seek out hostels that host social events and get talking to people through that.

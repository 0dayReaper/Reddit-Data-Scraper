    "postText": "As part of a bigger trip this year, I\u2019m planning to go to Greece, spend a few days in Athens and then visit a couple of islands, and then also spend a bit of time in Italy, specifically thinking coastal (Positano/Amalfi/Sorrento and maybe Capri). \nIdeally I\u2019m looking at spending about two weeks in Greece, and then two weeks Italy, and it will basically be the full month of August. \n\nBy way of background: I\u2019m 30F and will be solo (obv). I\u2019m not into a huge party/clubbing scene, but do like a bit of a vibrant atmosphere/nightlife (eg bars for drinking, meeting people etc). I like walking, but not after any strenuous hikes. Main goals would be spending a lot of time at beaches, swimming, and laying in the sun, and enjoying architecture, local food, and just general nice vibes. \n\nI have a few Qs that hoping for some help with:\nIslands-wise, my current thoughts are either Naxos/Paros/Milos, OR Zakynthos/Cefalonia - any thoughts on any of these and/or which combo might be better, in light of the above? \nI\u2019ve read the islands can be very busy over the summer period, will it be necessary to book all ferries and accomm like way in advance? Or will I be okay to book as I go (e.g. a few days/ a week in advance - I\u2019m not chill enough to just rock up places with no bookings at all!) \nre: italy, I\u2019ve done a lot of reading about all the different spots, but would love any guidance or your stories about where you liked and didn\u2019t like - especially if you\u2019re around my age and also a woman. After similar stuff as Greece really, just laying on beaches and wandering around and taking it a bit slow. \nAny accommodation recommendations would be very welcome. I\u2019m okay with anything really, provided it\u2019s nice and not expensive, but I would preference hostels/guesthouses where I might have opportunity for some socialising if possible. \n\nAny other recs, suggestions, comments are all welcome!",

            "comment": "Just a few quick ones\n\n* I found it cheapest to stay in Sorrento and day trip to other places along the amalfi coast\n\n* If you're solo traveling and on the beach, make sure you have some sort of strategy for your valuable belongings if you go swimming \n\n* 2 weeks Amalfi coast might be too long\n\n\n* In Greece, anytime you see a list of train/ferry options going to your destination, you will see a cheap option that takes a little longer. You might be tempted to take the cheap option like I did. It was the worst decision every time I did it. The travel times were often over double what they advertised. Ferry rides took up almost the entire day instead of a few hours. It's travel purgatory hell.",

Just stay in the upper open decks. Also, cancellations based on wind conditions is real. Do not ferry or fly to Athens on the same day your flight out is scheduled.",

What I'm saying is: Amalfi is going to be slammed (and expensive, and difficult to navigate).  \n\n\nYou're already doing the coastal experience in Greece, so I'd take a hard look at Florence + Lake Como or Lake Garda instead of Amalfi.",

Accommodation is another story, August is vacation month, the islands will be packed. Definitely book in advance and contact the owner/facility about flexibility in extending your stay or their policy if you decide to leave early.",

            "comment": "Recently spent a week around Naples/Amalfi coast. It's great, but visit it another time. Spring, autumn, both awesome there. Summer, not so much.\n\nMy general advice would be: If you're not looking for crowds and tourist hightlights but do like a vribrant locale, why not visit places that are a bit let downtrodden by daytrippers. Italy as a country is vibrant even in those place less visited (relatively). Pick one of those. Go lay on a lake somewhere, enjoy the sun and locale. But without the annual mass tourism wave your visit coincides with.\n\nAlso, mind the temp. This year I understand is an el nino year again. Even more likely than usual that it'll be extremely hot in august in most places in the med. Stay inside type hot.",

            "comment": "The Amalfi Coast is super crowded in August, so it is advisable to book your stay ahead of time, as hotels can be fully booked, especially during the week of Ferragosto. You could split your two weeks between the Amalfi Coast and Cilento Coast maybe? Since you mentioned that you enjoy architecture, you might like to visit the Greek temples of Paestum located in Cilento Coast. Also nearby Agropoli and Acciaroli has some nice beaches too.",

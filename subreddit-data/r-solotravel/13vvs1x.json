    "postText": "Hi, looking for some advice on my South America trip. It's going to be super detailed and long, so I'd just like to thank everyone in advance for reading through the whole thing! \n\n**Some basic information:** \n\n* Travel period: Any 8 weeks between May to July 2024 \n* Budget: USD $6000 excluding flights (\\~$107 a day) -- flexible \n* Countries in consideration: Colombia, Ecuador, Peru (confirmed), Bolivia-- will likely only select 2-3 from this list? Unsure \n* Interests: Hiking/trekking, nature, exploring local markets (Not a beach/watersports person if that said sport is near the beach) \n\n***Is it feasible to explore all 4 countries, or should I stick to just 2?*** \n\nI know the 'correct' answer is to just pick 2 and slowly travel, but I genuinely have various considerations and would greatly appreciate inputs. \n\n*Explore all 4?*\n\n This is my grad trip, and will possibly be my last long trip in years. I live in Singapore, and will work in an industry where taking a long leave is pretty much impossible. Because South America is so far, I will likely not return anytime soon (think 8-10 years lol). So it'd be ideal if I could explore as much of it as possible. I'm also quite a fast traveller, and don't mind taking options like night buses to save time. So a packed itinerary really isn't that much of an issue for me. \n\nI also wouldn't mind skipping activities if it is \"repeated\"? For instance, I would probably skip Paracas in Peru for Isla de la Plata in Ecuador, and if I were to go for an Amazon tour I would just do it in one of the countries etc. I know they offer different things, but I'm okay with not doing the \"full backpacking trail\", like the one in Peru where you basically go down from Lima to Cusco, stopping along Paracas, Huacachina etc. Also, I'm not a huge fan of beaches and stuff like surfing/snorkelling, so would probably only allocate 2-3 days out of the entire itinerary to relax on the beach. Would that save me enough time, such that I can somehow hit all 4 countries within 8 weeks? \n\nA tentative schedule would be: Colombia (2 weeks) &gt; Ecuador (1.5 week) &gt; Peru (3.5 weeks) &gt; Bolivia (1 week). \n\nColombia: Mostly city exploring-- Medellin and Cartegena, and probably do a tour in Cocora Valley in Salento? Maybe also head to Santa Marta for a while, and do the Lost City Trek after. (But I've decided on doing the Salkantay Trek in Peru, so unsure of whether it would be similar. Also, expensive. Any thoughts?) \n\nEcuador: I've only settled on the Otavalo Market, Cotopaxi trek, and Isla de la Plata (as a cheap alternative to Galapagos Islands). \n\nPeru: Lima (2 days) &gt; Huaraz (3 days): Various hiking day trips, Laguna 69, Pastoruri glacier &gt; Ica (3 days): Use as base for day trips to Huacachina for sandboarding and Paracas for day tours to see wildlife &gt; Arequipa (3 days): Explore city, Colca Canyon trek (might skip this?) &gt; Cusco (14 days): 4 days to acclimatise (including day tours to Salt mines and Rainbow mountain), 5 days Salkantay Trek to Machu Picchu, 1 day rest in Cusco, 3 days Manu Reservations to see the Amazon, 1 more day of rest. \n\nBolivia: La Paz (3 days) to explore the city, see the Witches market &gt; Uyuni (4 days) 3D2N salt flat and laguna Colorado tour \n\nFor the travel time between cities in each country, I've only looked into Peru so far, but it seems rather doable. I see that Cruz Del Sur offers comfortable night buses (which I can use to save time), and Peru Hop also seems to be an option. Based on your experience, would this be the same for other countries? \n\nAlso, what would you recommend adding/removing to the itinerary, if you have 8 weeks to travel to these countries? \n\n*Stick to just 2?* \n\nHonestly this seems the most rational. (1) save travel time (though flights between the countries seem rather short?) (2) save money (from flights between countries) (3) Enjoy two countries slowly without rushing it. \n\nI've decided that I definitely want to go to Peru, but I'm unsure about the other destination. I think my Peru itinerary would be largely the same as the above, but with extended stays at each location. (I've decided that I'm not really interested in seeing the Nazca lines, so I wouldn't add that in) Since it's rather trekking heavy, I'm leaning towards Colombia for city exploration (and also because many people have raved about it). Might also join a 3-week Spanish school that involves homestays? My main consideration for this option would be to choose a country that gives me an experience that would be very different from Peru. Would also be open to other South American countries not listed above. \n\nVery grateful to any of you that have read this post up to this point. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",

Also if we're going to tell anecdotes I can point to the half dozen hobbyist mountain bikers in excellent condition who travelled to La Paz to cycle the death road and were laid up in our hostel for multiple days.  You are correct, they may not experience it, and if they were spending multiple weeks in Bolivia I would tell them to just be aware, but when the average time it takes to get over it is 2 days and they are only planning on spending three days I think they should factor it in.",

Colca Canyon is a different climate, landscape, and geographical environment. You can also see Andean condors. \n\nBoth the Inca Trail and Salkantay are hikes done around Cusco/the Sacred Valley, so a different area. Afaik, Salkantay takes you past Humantay Lake, the Salkantay Pass (obviously) and some other stuff, whereas the Inca trail hits all the Incan settlements through the valley. I hit most of these destinations on tours, you aren't obligated to hike them, although trekking in the area is gorgeous.",

LATAM usually has part of the airline crew who speaks English try to help people go through immigration.\n\nFor La Paz, definitely ride the cable car system. It's so easy; you can get the plastic card and do a circuit where you go up to El Alto (getting a great view of the city/cemetery on the way), go across El Alto a couple stations, and then descend back into La Paz. You never have to leave the stations/cable car circuit. Also, try salte\u00f1as. If you can swing it, the earth formations resembling a moonscape are also a quick drive outside of the city. It's also worth going to the main square to see the new governmental building and other stuff (there will probably be something going on, like a rally).\n\nFor Uyuni, you might try to find a restaurant that serves llama if you're into trying that kind of thing. The locomotive graveyard is also outside Uyuni. It's probably already included in your salar trip, of course. If you speak any Spanish at all, try to get put in a Spanish speaking tour vehicle. You're way more likely to have an actual Bolivian tourist or two who can randomly tell you about stuff, in addition to other tourists from around South America. It's way more informative and interesting, and Spanish enunciation is the generic gold standard in Peru/Bolivia for the most part, so even a struggling gringo can comprehend.\n\nFor Bolivia in general, try to find Coka Quina if you're into soda. Try to find Kola Real in Peru as well. These are the real homegrown sodas and (imo) taste better than normal Coca Cola. KR in Peru floors Inka Kola as well, in my humble opinion.",

            "comment": "glad that you're choosing down on south am! everything considered, i would recommend all 4 tbh. if you can do, id recommend to swap ecuador for chile. reason being that as south america is huge - you'll be much better accommodating as much geography as you can (accounting for weather of course) - ecuador and peruvian mountains are very similar, and chile has a very different vibe and geography from the rest. also santiago - jfk flights are quite cheap for some reason for the flight home.\n\nin a nutshell, I'd recommend you to focus on narrowing down to a few geography &amp; places that you would like, considering the weather conditions - and start planning from there. it's much easier to prioritise and you'd make the itinerary around them rather than the other way around.\n\nfeel free to dm for anything specific!",

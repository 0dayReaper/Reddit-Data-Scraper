I\u2019m planning on traveling the first two weeks with my brother and cousins and the second two weeks with my parents after that I\u2019m going to be alone and I could use any suggestions. Also if anybody is doing a similar trip, I\u2019m open for people to join. Also does a budget of $10,000 seem correct?\n\nFirst Two Weeks, With Friends\n\nDays 1-3: Porto, June 7-9\nDays 4-6: Madrid, June 10-12\nDays 7-9: Barcelona, June 13-15\nDays 10-12: Valencia, June 16-18\nDays 13-15: Granada, June 19-21\nDays 16-17: Malaga, June 22-23\nSecond Two Weeks, With Parents:\n\nDays 18-20: Barcelona, June 24-26\nDays 21-23: Valencia, June 27-29\nDays 24-26: Cordoba, June 30-July 2\nDays 27-29: Seville, July 3-5\nDays 30-31: Cordoba, July 6-7\nDays 32-33: Granada, July 8-9\nThird Two Weeks, Solo:\n\nDays 34-36: Rome, July 10-12\nDays 37-39: Florence, July 13-15\nDays 40-42: Perugia, July 16-18\nDays 43-45: Venice, July 19-21\nDays 46-48: Milan, July 22-24\nDays 49-52: Dublin, July 25-28",

Seems like a waste to move around so much just to come back and do it all over again, no? It\u2019s probably feasible but definitely too much",

I'd slow down a bit and plan closer to 3-4 days in less locations.  Otherwise, you're going to exhaust yourself and only get a glimpse of the cities you are visiting.",

            "comment": "It seems like you will be spending 2-3 days in most places, and while it's doable, that can be l exhausting to do for 60 days. Think of the time packing, taking trains/buses/flights, check in the new place (hoping it's already check in time and you go to the room, if you arrive before check in you'll be wandering with your things), etc etc... I'd suggest planning at least 3-4 or even 5 days in bigger cities like Rome, Madrid, Barcelona, and scheduling free days just to catch your breath and have a nap, spend an afternoon in a park/beach or stay in if you want to. Spending only 1 night in some places usually leaves you with just barely 24hs in one place, and although it's doable, it's not sustainable for 60 days.\nAlso, June-July can be very hot, specially in the south of Spain and in Italy, and that is exhausting as well. Maybe stay more days in the cities we're you'll have beaches so you can relax in between travels, like in M\u00e1laga and Barcelona? \nAlso, I see that you'll repeat places with friends and your parents, is there no way to choose different destinations that are also close by so to not having to come back?",

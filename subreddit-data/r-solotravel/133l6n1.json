You can't beat the location though train-wise so if you have a short layover between trains it could make a good crash pad.\n\nEdit: Oh and there aren't really any common areas to hang out besides the loud bar on the ground floor. Their website says that there is one single \"chill out room\" somewhere in the hostel but idk where it was; there were definitely no common areas on my floor. No kitchen or couches or anything.",

We need some sort of meaningful social life that is hard to get solo traveling because we stay with people very little time and they tend to live far away from us.

Talk to the local Oaxacan girl sitting me at a bar and discover her recommendations for good cocktail bars.  Make a \"best friend\" at a hostel by activity getting involved in hostel activities which lead to renting a car and checking out some random sighseeing places a few hours away.

Get to the next town, get dinner, talk to a waitress, she'd say \"Welcome to our town, we are pleasant, but be careful of the next town down the road, they're crazy!\". It was like that the whole way down lol.  \n \n  \nMore than that, I take with me: Foods, tastes, spices, recipes.

I\u2019ve learnt so much and made so many interesting connections because of this. I\u2019m more confident, open to being emotionally vulnerable, and it\u2019s just changed my perspective on \u2026 everything!\n\n2. I can see more clearly how I\u2019m changing over time. For example, my trips used to be 90% culture, history, museums, etc. It\u2019s now about 40% nature and hiking. \n\nGuess that\u2019s the introspection that comes with being solo :)",

Back home I would never really keep track of that coffee, takeout lunch, extra drink at the bar, etc. But when traveling especially for long periods with a set amount of money it\u2019s really important, and I think helps you to make more conscious decisions on what and how to spend your money! This is definitely something I\u2019ll continue when I\u2019m home.",

You're the only one responsible for making your day great or boring.\n\n2) I learned that I was more capable than I was told or believed I was3) \"No/rejection\" usually is not definitive. Meaning, if someone tells you \"No\", basically they're saying \"Not right now\", however, I can change my mind if you convince me. (This is not related to dating though, if someone tells you NO, be respectful and leave. I'm talking about opportunities in life, such as a job or business opportunities) Always try to negotiate and ask questions.\n\n4) The worst scenario is usually in your head, honestly it usually doesn't happen and even if it did, it usually isn't as bad as your brain wants you to believe (Same with the positive though)\n\n5) It only takes 1 step to turn your life in a different direction, just 1 plane ticket, just saying yes to a course in another country, just making the first contact with a lawyer to work on the visa process. So just start small. You'll figure it out later.\n\n6) I'm still figuring this thing out, but traveling alone, doesn't mean being lonely, people are usually happy to chat with you, they're just afraid of making the first contact. If you literally make the first move, it'll be awkward at first, but then you could make a friend of life, try to have just 5 seconds of braveness and talk to a stranger (Tip, always try to speak to people that are by themselves, they're usually more open to talking (Don't be creepy though, never do it at night or in a lonely place lol), if you go with couples, they usually want to be left alone.",

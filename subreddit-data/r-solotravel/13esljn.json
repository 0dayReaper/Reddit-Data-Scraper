    "postText": "Hey Solo Travelers!\n\nI found a bed bug a couple of weeks ago at a hostel in Buenos Aires. I killed it and saw bites on me. I didn't take much out of my suitcase that night and my backpack was in a metal locker. \n\nThe same day I went to an airbnb with a washer dryer and put my clothes in a high heat dryer. I bought pesticide spray with permethrin an\n\nd sprayed my suitcase after inspecting it and vacuuming it. I didn't find anything in there. I put my shoes in the freezer and also other toiletries for about 24 hrs.\n\nI did the same thing a week later when I got to Rio de Janeiro since I got bites during my time in Iguazu. I wasn't sure if these were delayed bites or something else. I honestly am paranoid now. I have gone thru the hassle which was time consuming and required additional expense. I'm at a new hostel now and got some bites but at this point I have paranoia if it's still bed bugs from the past incident or mosquitoes which do come into the room. Any tips on how to confirm if I brought any hitchhikers or this is just ptsd? \n\nAnd I'm almost 2 months into an approx 9 month trip, I'm not keen in throwing out all my stuff.\n\nThank you!\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for the tips. Though just 2 ppl or so actually tried to answer my question lol. How do I confirm I killed them after going through the cleaning process? Or do I have ptsd?\n\nI am gonna downsize my luggage so the bag will go to the trash. Again, I have 7 months to go on this trip and I'm not planning to throw clothes out. Thanks!",

To build on this, a lot of times the bites will be in groups of 3\u2019s. \n\nI moved into an apartment complex in my 20\u2019s and had no idea bedbugs actually existed - the only time I had heard of them was in the children\u2019s nursery rhyme / bedtime prayer thing. \n\nI knew I was getting bit but didn\u2019t know what as they would typically come at night. It took me 6 months before I knew what it was and my neighbor was the one that clued me in. Long story short - my apartment was sprayed SIX times in 2.5 years and they came back every single time since the landlord refused to spray the attached apartments as well. I left almost 3 years in after the 6th spray and I am not joking when I say I lost every thing I owned besides a bag of clothes for me, my husband and my LO. 2 boxes of family mementos, etc and a bed that was way too expensive to toss. The family mementos and the bed went into storage for two years before I was even comfortable with pulling them out. \n\nNo matter where you are now, my vote is to walk into YOUR own home naked and leave whatever you had with you on your trip besides electronics outside on fire. \n\nSeriously though, be careful. Those things are evil. So evil.",

Eventually after almost a year I\u2019d stop getting bites. \n\nI moved out and got a new mattress and box spring and sheets.  \nBetween places I did the dryer on all my clothes for 3 hours at the mega-mat, while wearing new clothes. \n\nI also toss all my old cardboard boxes and books. A used book is where they came from. My first one was found on the book shelf and at the time I didn\u2019t know what it was.

I have never brought them home by following this (also how I support clients with infestations)\n\n-Anything that can be heat treated, do so for at least one hour on HIGH heat in a dryer (above 140 degrees)\n\n-Anything that cannot be heat treated should go into a freezer set below freezing for at least 72 hours (cold takes longer to kill bedbugs at all life stages than heat)\n\n-Pesticides do almost nothing. If you want prevention, keep your things in an airtight plastic tub if possible. Bedbugs can crawl anywhere, in electric outlets, lockers, baseboards, and live for a long time without a blood meal (up to a year) so keeping your things sequestered is the best way to stay safe. Laundering regularly on high heat will also help. \n\n-Try not to obsess or fixate on it. You can always heat treat all your things when you come home. Go to any exterminator and ask to use their hot box. You can also buy one for home if you have the budget. \n\n-Bedbug bites are annoying and itchy but otherwise harmless. Get a good anti itch cream, it\u2019ll be easier to cope if you are comfortable. \n\n-Inspect mattresses and pillows at hostels and hotels. Pay attention to the seams, that\u2019s where they like to gather. Wooden or upholstered bed frames are easier to infest than metal.",

I would buy cheap clothes that you plan on trashing then take every single item of clothing to the laundry mat. Dry on high heat. Make sure you don\u2019t have any toiletry bags with fabric. If so, I\u2019d honestly just trash them and get new ones. Does your suitcase have a lot of fabric or is it one of those plastic ones? They don\u2019t like plastic, but their eggs are so hard to get out of fabric.\n\nAsk the people at the laundromat if you can dry your shoes\u2014anything with fabric (like sneakers). Plastic sandals would be fine. \n\nI\u2019d get your clothes back from the laundry mat then immediately trash the cheap clothes in a garbage bin somewhere away from the hostel. \n\nI should also add that I\u2019m in Brazil and I get bit by mosquitos all the time.

A lot of the 'anti bedbug' poisons arent very effective. Diatomaceous earth is extremely effective at killing them. Diatomaceous earth is a dessicant, it will stick to the bedbugs and literally dehydrate them to death.",

Common locations include the neck, face, back, chest, arms, legs and around the crotch.\n\n[https://www.greenpestsolutions.com/blog/bed-bug-versus-mosquito-bites/](https://www.greenpestsolutions.com/blog/bed-bug-versus-mosquito-bites/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I would spray your backpack and inside of your shoes with permethrin\n   * Freezer won't kill bedbugs in 24 hours\n* Buy a steamer e.g Bissell Steam Shot and kill the bed bugs that might be hiding in the crevice of your luggage\n   * Unzip it so the plastic inside shows (handles, wheels, etc and steam blast it.\n\nYou really don't need to throw out all of your stuff.\n\nTake a shower - hot wash &amp; hot dry (30 minutes) everything - spray down your gear with Permethrin\n\nAlways check your lodging for signs of bed bugs\n\nChances are that you won't see any bugs at all, but if you see their poop trails, you know they are present. For a thorough bed bug examination, use a flashlight to look around the headboard, under the sheets and mattress pad, under the mattress and box springs, and around the base of the bed.\n\n[https://www.consumerreports.org/hotels/check-for-bed-bugs-hotel-a1147446606/](https://www.consumerreports.org/hotels/check-for-bed-bugs-hotel-a1147446606/)",

But you can do a number of things, even the steps you took at the new location with the spraying and inspection you could have been done at the hostel you were at to begin with and washed at a laundromat. There's been a lot of good advice in this thread already. I'd also bag up all my stuff in plastic. \n\nTo bring your exposed belongings into what I can only assume is someone's home to use their appliances to wash isn't very cool. They really don't deserve to have to be exposed to it too and we all know how quickly it spreads. I'm sure at the moment you didn't intend for this though.",

If you read some of the reddit bed bug stories you'll know why. \n\nMy mate and I put everything in a dryer and informed the hotel who changed our room. We vacuumed all our electronics. Yes, they can get into laptops. Anything we couldn't put in the dryer apart from our electronics we threw away, including bags. Coming home, we bought a new bag and put our belongings in a garbage bag inside the bag. We threw away the clothes we were wearing and bought new clothes at our layover destination. At home we put all the garbage bags inside the trunk of our cars and left it over a summer in Australia (this was in addition to having it already been through a dryer). \n\nWe probably went a little too far but personally I couldn't stomach bringing bedbugs to my house. They can get into your books and furniture and if that happens it's game over. So I minimised the risk as much as could. No bed bugs got home :).",

You\u2019re off to a great start. \nHere\u2019s what worked for me:\n- Heat. You\u2019ve got the dryer. Make sure everything you own is in there for at least an hour. See if you can buy or borrow a high heat steam wand and use it on anything that doesn\u2019t fit in the dryer. This saved my mattresses and couch.\n- Cimexa. It\u2019s a desiccant like diatomaceous earth but smaller particles so it sticks to the bugs better. This is really better for if you\u2019re staying in one place, but apply it to all the cracks, crevices, outlets, and furniture (dressers &amp; nightstands) you can. Wear a mask when using it and do not put it on your clothing or anywhere that you may sit or lay. Inhaling the stuff is not good.\n\nI also sprayed chemicals everywhere and have no idea if it worked or not because I used so many methods.\n\nAs for the bites and paranoia, I live in a swamp and have mosquito bites constantly. I noticed that the bed bug bites were itchy and visible for longer and would usually have a tiny pustule in the center about 1-2 days after the bites occurred. This is the only thing that has kept me sane when I look at my bites and the panic starts setting in.\n\nI started checking everything in a room when I travel before bringing my bags into the room. I also put all of my clothes into compression packing cubes - saves space and puts an extra layer between bugs and my stuff. \n\nBest of luck!",

If you've already washed all your stuff at high heat and dried it on a dryer machine, it should be fine. If you are still in doubt, these bugs usuallu defecate on the sheets, so if everything is clean and there's no sign of them around your stuff or the bed, they're probably gone.

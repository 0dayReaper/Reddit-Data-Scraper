    "postText": "I am taking my first solo trip to Indonesia and the travel agency (Intrepid) requires \"that at a minimum you are covered for medical expenses including emergency repatriation\" valuing at $250,000 USD. Most insurance companies don't even cover up to this amount. Has anyone been on an intrepid trip before and can recommend what companies to purchase from that covers the minimums required by Intrepid? \n\nThanks!!",

If you google '(city) travel insurance you'll likely find plenty of places near you in case you prefer to speak to a broker in person. There are also many online travel insurance providers though I chose a local provider myself.\n\n\\*\\*edited to add - my policy cost me $48 CAD ($36 USD) and covers me up to $5 million CAD ($3.7 million USD); I double checked 3 other sites and all had the same coverage amount though varied on small details and cost",

I don't recall what the minimum amount was at the time (maybe it's gone up since Covid?), but I just used the travel medical coverage that I have through my work extended health benefits. Do you have any insurance through work? But honestly I don't think they check too carefully. I did have to show them proof of insurance upon arrival but they didn't check the amount of coverage.",

Your travel insurance must provide cover against personal accident, death, medical expenses and emergency repatriation with a recommended minimum coverage of US$200,000 for each of the categories of cover. We also strongly recommend it covers cancellation, curtailment, personal liability and loss of luggage and personal effects. You must provide your travel insurance policy number and the insurance company's 24-hour emergency contact number on the first day of your trip; you will not be able to join the trip without these details. If you have travel insurance connected to your credit card or bank account please ensure you have details of the participating insurer, the insurance policy number and emergency contact number with you rather than the bank's name and credit card details.\"",

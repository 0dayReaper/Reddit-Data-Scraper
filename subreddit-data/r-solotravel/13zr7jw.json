I have no specific budget, thankfully, but I also am not going to be staying 5 star hotels.\n\nHeavily into architecture, museums, exploration of ruins and mountains and amazing views and historical sights.\n\nNot into laying on the beach or spending a lot of time at restaurants or sitting around.\n\n* 6 days in Istanbul (I want to split Istanbul into 2 parts to avoid city fatigue, although I love cities...)\n* 7 days driving around Antalya along the coast both east as far as Mamure Castle and west as far as Ephesus and then back\n* 4 days in Cappadocia to fully explore all the underground cities, hike around, Ilhara valley, etc. (but I've been told that 3 nights is enough?)\n* 5 days back in Istanbul for the remaining time\n\nI have a list of sights I'm looking at seeing that I will post once I can get them off of Google Maps, lol.\n\nWhatcha think?

Nemrut and G\u00f6beklitepe marked, is that for another time? 4 days is a great amount of time for Cappadocia.",

It's a huge tourist spot. I visited with a big history buff friend, so I just went along with him because he really wanted to see it.\n\nBut if I was to do my trip over again, I personally would skip it. Ephesus is just out of the way and I don't love ruins enough to take a flight to go see them, but idk that's me.\n\nTermessos was so great because it was actually *quiet*, and it had amazing views. Not many people when I was there, probably because you need to actually hike to it. And it's on the way to Antalya, which I was going to anyways.\n\nSo I guess it just depends on how much you love ruins?",

It quickly gets overrun. I went there, then drove to Aphrodisias. Ephesus is a little more impressive, but Aphrodisias was better on account of there were only 2 other vehicles there. I spent a couple hours there and didn't bump into a single person - just saw them off in the distance. Although it's also very busy, Pamukkale &amp; Heiropolis are unique and worth seeing if you're going to be nearby at Aphrodisias. All these places can be squeezed in to one long day.",

Start in the European part and when you get tired of the busy city life hop on a boat and stay at Kadikoy on the Asian side for a more chill atmosphere. I did a 3/2 day split and it was okay. You don't need 11 days there.\nUnderground cities in Capadocia are boring and expensive for what they are. The entrance fee for one was 230 tl for a 30 min visit. Best to spend time hiking around all the valleys, it's free and more rewarding.",

Late night flight to Izmir. If no flight, you can add a small hike or one small sight in late afternoon. \n\nIf you are a fast hiker or take museums fast, you can do Turkish Night or haman in one evening or visit Uchisar castle or Avanos or Cavusin. We wanted to to Uchisar castle in day 3 with Love Valley hike,  but it started raining so we skipped it.",

While there are quite a few museums/ palaces to explore, 6 days would be more than adequate to cover those. \n\nI didn't really enjoy Antalya, and would recommend that you probably make a drive down to Kas and Fethiye (ruins, hiking, beaches). Fethiye is a nice coastal town, and you could explore the likes of Oludeniz as well which is about 30 mins drive away. \n\nFor Cappadocia, 4 days would be adequate. If you are planning on the hot air balloon tour, I would suggest that you pre book it on the first or second day. Due to weather conditions, it is common for it to be canceled/ rescheduled. This call is made by the aviation authorities which can be unpredictable. You could join both the Red and Green tour which would very much cover all the iconic sites in Gerome and Uchisar. You could consider the sunset atv or horseriding tour as well :)",

The turkish lira equivalent would vary from there depending on the exchange rates which can fluctuate quite a bit. Other than that for shopping and dining, lira is still the the common currency. I'll usually only head to places where the prices are clearly stated to avoid being ripped off for sure",

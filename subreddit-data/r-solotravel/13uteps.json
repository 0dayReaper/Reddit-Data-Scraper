    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m a 20M from the US and currently traveling through Serbia, just came from Subotica and Sremski Karlovci, but happen to be in Novi Sad for a while until I leave, wasn\u2019t planning on being here so long so I only have so much planned to do. I\u2019ve been hiking for a while and in nature, so would like to have some fun while I\u2019m in Novi Sad and then Belgrade. \n\nSince I have a great deal of time I was looking for some local \u201ccafe bars\u201d or good cafes to drink and/or possibly meet some locals and things. I don\u2019t necessarily like to club so I would like somewhere in between to meet people at some point, because my hostel seems to only have people 60+ staying haha.\n\nI was wondering if anyone could give me some advice for interesting places. I\u2019ve done my far share of research, although I\u2019m not sure where would be a good place for me to go. Any help would be greatly appreciated from a local or someone whose visited for either to meet people. Thanks!",

It\u2019s lights out at 10pm and then you have to fuck off or go upstairs. The owner, Dragan, is a very cool guy and you can definitely find people to go out with there but the partying will not be taking place at the hostel itself, FYI!",

I have lots, also try Trollekelder, Le Bal Infernal (an old book shop), Cafe Den Turk and try Waterzooi, you'll see it on most menus its a lovely chicken soup! Inbox me if you'd lile more. \n\nI'd also recommend you go and see the Ghent Altarpiece...it blew my mind. Only a few euros too which is a bargain. ",

During weekdays, you can see the specialists live at work (glass window to restoration space). The museum itself is a hidden gem in itself. The SMAK on the other side of the road does modern  art if you are into that. Both museums are a 20 minute walk from where you are staying!",

Very chill and jazzy vibe and it was my go-to bar when I lived in Ghent.\n\nGo to the right and follow the river (the street name is Recolletenlei) and you'll find an Irish Pub with great food and a nice terrace in the back: Patrick Foley's.\n\nThat's just on top of my head, Ghent is amazing and there are so many (hidden/unknown) places to check out. My whole family was born and raised in Ghent, I only lived there while studying (10 years ago), but plan to go back. And I know my way around, so feel free to ask what exactly you want to do or visit.",

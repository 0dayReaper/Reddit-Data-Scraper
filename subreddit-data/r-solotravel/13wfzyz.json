    "postText": "Maybe I'm just in the wrong hostel but I feel its much harder to make friends here in Amsterdam because it's such a popular friend group destination. I've met several people from the UK, but they are all in big groups, much like I was when I visited here. \n\nI don't feel like there's a lot of solo people here and I quite like meeting new people no matter where I go. Was also looking to take some truffles with someone as it's a bit more enjoyable with social interaction. \n\nBefore I get comments telling me I don't need others to enjoy myself, I know, just wondering if others have experienced difficulties specifically in Amsterdam.",

I actually joined a stag party for a bit and it was fun.  \n\nIf you visit the touristy places you like and see solo'ers just chat them up.  It's always awkward introducing yourself but information sharing is super helpful when in the middle of a trip.  Like I'll usually ask people what they saw already and what they plan to see.  Then if there's any overlap for future site, offer to join but don't be surprised if they don't want company as many solo travelers like to keep solo.",

I have travelled with them. However the group mentality they have is different to others. If you aren\u2019t english and white good luck",

I haven\u2019t been to Amsterdam, but I just finished 1.5 months through various other European cities and I found that the hostel you stay at does a lot for how easy/difficult it is to meet other solo travelers. Some get booked by soloers more, some offer better group activities, and some are just too big to easily mingle. \n\nI\u2019ve personally found free walking tours to be a reliable way to find friends for the next few days - solo travelers are often easy to spot there, and are usually eager to chat &amp; hang out after the tour is done when you introduce yourself and start a conversation (\u201cwhere are you traveling from?\u201d)",

I feel a lot of people are trying to give me advice on how to find people (I'm an experienced traveller and I appreciate it!) but yeah, glad to see you've had a similar experience.

They were something else lol. Nice enough but wow. They go hard. Free walking tours I\u2019ve found are awesome to meet people on if I\u2019m solo. Learn about the city and there\u2019ll be other solo there folk too. Then after go grab dinner or something. Or if there\u2019s something you\u2019re really into, like the Van Gogh museum etc, go on a tour there and you know there\u2019s like minded people. A good ice breaker!",

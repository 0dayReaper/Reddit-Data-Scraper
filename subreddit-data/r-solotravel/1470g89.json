    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m (26f) going to be alone for two days in Tbilisi and looking for recommendations on 1) places that specialize in wine tasting or similar experiences to get a taste of local wine 2) good local eats. My budget is $100.\n\nIdeally I\u2019d like to see Borjormi National Park and Vardzia caves via a small local group tour starting for Tbilisi, but the ones I saw ended at 11pm which is too later for me :( Please recommend if you\u2019re familiar with any operators.\n\nAlso, would you please share your experiences in this city? My colleague and stylist comment this region was not safe, so I\u2019m not feeling very adventurous about my trip.",

However, pretty much every Georgian place in Tbilisi serves good food.   \n\nPlease don't worry about safety as I've never felt unsafe there as a solo woman, everyone is very respectful.  One thing I'd warn you about is that it is very very hot in August, maybe try out one of the baths, they have cold water pools to cool you down!",

However you can also book a private bath for not too much money and then you get a room to yourself with a sauna, a thermal pool and a cold water pool.  Just check out the prices and what's on offer around the baths area \u263a\ufe0f",

Vardzia is an amazing place but it\u2019s pretty far away from Tbilisi so if you want to do it as a day trip then yeah you are going to be back to Tbilisi pretty late. I think it took us 4 or 4.5 hours to get from Tbilisi to Vadrzia. Mountain roads, what can I say!",

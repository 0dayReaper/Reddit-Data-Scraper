    "postText": "I'm ending my 16 day (Europe) trip in Munich and have spent 3 days here and find that people here have been very cold and unfriendly to me. And I come from a country where people aren't so outwardly friendly so it says something coming from me. Eg. I was in a store and asked for help and staff pointed to the locked glass cases and told me to go look and see if the item I wanted was there. I went in and attempted speaking in German btw. An American couple comes a few minutes behind me, speaking only in English and the lady is all to happy to assist and show them whatever they need. This is my experience in 3 out for 4 stores, where even if I want help no one really bothers. So while I planned to do some shopping today on my last day I pretty much stopped and just walked around a bit and came back early. Maybe I just have an unfriendly face or is this a cultural thing? I haven't experienced this anywhere else I've travelled to.",

As a result I spent quite a lot of time in Germany, specifically southern Germany) and also got to spend a bit of time in Berlin when she (the ex-gf) relocated there for university and I worked a project in Berlin.\n\n1. The south is way more conservative and racist than the north. Not attempting to equate the two but the Nazi party started in Munich. \n2. Germany has a history of Turkic and Arab, and recently Indian, immigration and there is quite a lot of racist ire directed against people of this appearance. From the perspective of a bigoted person from Germany they aren\u2019t going to differentiate Indian from Arab or Turk.\n3. Shop owners tend to be friendly towards middle aged stereotypical white American tourists because they spend money on stupid shit.\n4. When I was with the Ex-gf I experienced much less of this racism. But even then, in the south, and by people that were a generation older than us, I was often treated with casual disdain. The ex was beautiful in a typical Germanic way (thin, blonde hair, blue eyes) and the attitude towards us in the south was \u201cwhy are you dating this brown guy?\u201d\n5. The experience was completely different in Berlin. I genuinely felt like people didn\u2019t give a shit where I was from (the same way people don\u2019t really care what part of the world you are from in NYC; everyone is from all over) Berlin (was a lot like NYC) conversations and communities focused on academic, artistic, and cultural interests as opposed to origin and background.\n6. I found that younger people were actually quite interested in my background and culture (genuinely and not in an exotic-fetishized way) I genuinely felt that younger people from cities took pride in a multi-cultural Germany (much like I took pride in the multi cultural nature of NYC)\n7. This is going to get me roasted but overall I have experienced way more racism in Europe than I ever have in the USA",

Unless your in rural Alabama talking to the hick behind the counter of the convenience store (and even then, he may be genuinely interested).\n\nIt is only with great trepidation that I ask about anyone's background nowadays because of the defensiveness and coolness such questions sometimes trigger (unless they are of my generation... when it was no big deal). Sort of a lost opportunity, because I like hearing about peoples different life experiences. This sort of highlights why it's seldom a good idea trying to mind read others, and make assumptions about what they are thinking and what their attitudes are.",

But it\u2019s definitely not \u201calmost always the case\u201d The vast majority of the time the \u201cwhere are you from?\u201d \u2026 \u201cughh?? I was born here\u201d \u2026 \u201cyeah but like where are you actually from\u201d is not out of curiosity about my Indian heritage, it\u2019s usually based on the subtle notion that I can\u2019t be American.\nNow in support of your statement, the above type of question isn\u2019t that common anymore; and it is certainly a rarity amongst younger people.\nMuch more often I get a question of \u201cwhere is your family from, or what is your heritage\u201d it\u2019s pretty easy to tell if the follow up to that is going to be negative because that person is xenophobic \u2026 most commonly the follow up is \u201coh that\u2019s awesome I love Indian food and I\u2019m trying to learn a bit about Indian cooking from this YouTube channel or Indian films, or I\u2019m interested in Hindu or Buddhist philosophy or I\u2019ve always wanted to visit India\u201d\nSo if your curiosity in a persons heritage is from interest it is really uncommon that you will get an offended response. And don\u2019t be let down on the rare occasion someone is offended \u2026 some people just want to be mad about something.\nI know media has primed us to think people will be pissed if you ask them about where they are from, but most of my friends in the States aren\u2019t white Americans (but they are Americans) and we are rarely offended by a question of heritage or ethnic background.\nMy one friend that does get annoyed is 4th generation Japanese American. She is from America, her heritage is American, and she doesn\u2019t know anything more about Japan than I or some white kid from Nebraska. I don\u2019t even think her parents have been to Japan. But she is gorgeous and the question of \u201cwhere are you from\u201d is usually some fetishization of her Asian features.",

It's just a lot more in the media and public consciousness in the US. Another thing people seldom think about... racism, in one form or another, is prevalent all over the world. Indeed, in many non western countries it's not even taboo. I know someone who visited Saudi Arabia and had a conversation with someone there who was just unashamedly racist.\n\nSome modern scholars would almost lead one to believe racism is a western invention. While 'scientific' racism obviously was (since science as we know it today was a western invention), I find it hard to believe that distrust and an inclination to negative judgmental attitudes towards outsiders (particularly if they differ in ethnicity/skin color) hasn't always existed everywhere.",

That was a dubious claim at best. There was rigorous scientific inquiry in China, Persia, and India and over much of the Islamic world while western civilization was still drinking and shitting out of the same water source and drowning and burning people to see if they were possessed. \n\nThe \u201cscientific method\u201d as a way of universalizing, systematizing, and repeating scientific inquiry and falsifiability is a Western creation, and it\u2019s one of the most important advances in scientific inquiry as it has allowed for the exponentially rapid progress of science.\n\nAND its the systematizing and institutionalizing that makes racism is such a convoluted issue in the west. \n\nRacism is all over the place yes \u2026 but the West universalized, institutionalized, and systematized racism in a very structural way. Laws were made and codified and systems of oppression were ingrained into our governments and institutions in a way that goes much beyond cultural racism (this the entire premise of CRT and anytime someone rails on CRT I ask them to explain their understanding of CRT and I get some unintelligible answer \u2026 and to be clear I\u2019m not in anyway accusing you of that, you are responding and posting legitimate and intelligible issues \u2026 but the CRT issue is an entirely different discussion for a different forum)\n\nCultural racism is much easier to stamp out then institutionalized racism. These structures persist today and are what prevent America from truly being a representative democracy and a meritocracy. \n\nSaudi Arabia is not a good example, it\u2019s totally fucked and not the standard to which we should be comparing any country, let alone the USA. No one on earth thinks of Saudi Arabia as a beacon of democratic values. SA is arguably one of the most evil political regimes in existence. (This isn\u2019t a damning of Saudis as a people it\u2019s a statement about the values of Saudi Arabia as a national state)\n\nSo racism is difficult in the west because we pride ourselves on modernity, meritocracy, and tolerance yet we still have the deeply ingrained structural problems as a direct result of racism. Our societies were built on the backs of slave labor (under the guise of democracy) in a very ingrained way.\n\nThe west also has freedom of speech and it allows us to discuss and confront these issues and it\u2019s the entire reason why I\u2019d rather be a POC in the states or a handful of other \u201cwestern\u201d countries than anywhere else in the world.",

Most medievalists nowadays would no doubt say the whole idea of a 'middle' ages was a scam foisted on us by Renaissance humanists, and they would point out Occam (of Occam's razor fame) and a couple of other medieval proto-scientists. And of course there was contributions from all over Afro-Eurasia across the ages. I think the idea of continuity can be exaggerated though... something clearly happened in the early modern period that really got the ball rolling like it had never rolled before. We live with both the amazing advantages and increasingly frightening consequences of that.\n\nInteresting distinction between cultural and institutionalized racism. I don't know enough broad history to comment intelligently. I wonder about the Hammurabi code? Would be interesting to know if and how it classified people. At first I was drawn by the Ottoman practice of taking first born sons from the Greeks and Balkan peoples for their 'slave' army as a counter example, but I guess that was based more on religion than race. Same for the Mughal's that conquered India. The Chinese were historically, of course, notoriously xenophobic. But that isn't specifically about race either, though in all these cases the lines start to get blurred, and you have to wonder if SOME of it wasn't about race.",

Obviously not perfectly and not without a lot of pushback still but in the grander arc of discourse...\n\nHere there is an aggressive reaction to accusations of racism and thus, often denial. For example, in French there's often this phrase that we don't use the word race anymore so how could we be racist. (The word 'race' is considered very inappropriate now but has equally just been replaced by discourse of colour or ethnicity). And that starts this cycle of how can there be racism? I've never heard about it. And then when faced with incidents, it always becomes, well that wasn't racism that was probably actually about xxxxxxx or xxxxxx instead. \n\nAnd thus they also often dismiss discussions about racism and how it's baked into our culture as 'American rhetoric' or 'American problems'.",

I didn't expect her to be able to speak English, but it's one of the most visited tourist destinations in Munich and German fluency should not have been expected.",

The levels of discrimination vary country to country though. I found France especially Paris the most welcoming. In my experience I\u2019d say being a westerner who can speak some French there counts much more than dark skin (unless you\u2019re Arab). Manchester, UK is one of the friendliest places I\u2019ve been, and people in Istanbul didn\u2019t seem to care about color much. The only place I\u2019ve had problems so far is Italy. Not sure if it is different for people of Indian descent there, but I faced a lot of discrimination. Basically I don\u2019t judge Europe as a whole\u2014 it depends on the country.",

Some context ~ i was 20 she was 19, she was a stripper and i happened to be a bouncer where she stripped. So, being around drunk, sleazy men while they blatantly hit on my girlfriend was completely normal for both of us haha. Eventually though, they got her way too drunk, or she got herself drunk, id believe either story, once she was like \"too drunk\" they started asking me about us, and that lead to the \"leader\" i called him (he was fattest, and paid for everything) blatantly saying \"Okay okay.. seriously how much\" and gestures to my passed out GF. I laugh and iirc say things like \"haha you dont know what youre getting yourself into\" or along those lines, then jokingly said \"If you got one of those 200ft yachts for trade maybe ill consider it\", and they LITERALLY BROKE INTO A HUDDLE, and then i tapped one and said \"Hey we gotta go outside and grab our friend from the line\" and i threw my girl over my shoulder and threw her into a cab back to our room. Oh and then, THEN, the cab driver was hesitant to let my gf out of the cab, because hed thought i had drugged her... She managed to blurt out a slurred \"HES MY BF\".",

In S.A they like have pretty girls around almost like they like having super cars around. It\u2019s a flex, and they don\u2019t want to hurt their pretty girls. \n\nI met some girls that would eventually reveal they had \u201csugar daddies\u201d almost everywhere, and they would fly in occasionally and spend a week in a hotel with them. Singapore was huge for this, as well as Australia, as they are wealthy and near Manila.

When I went to Munich in 2016 with family we all felt like the Germans in Fussen and Munich were extremely unhelpful and downright rude at times. There were several situations but a couple that stand out were when we checked out of the hotel in fussen. We prepaid for the hotel through their website prior to the trip (I have never even heard of a hotel where you don\u2019t pre pay). At check out the lady at the reception desk refused to give us our passports back and insisted we pay again. We showed the receipt for the payment, and the credit card charge for the booking along with the hotels email confirming payment. The lady called us stupid and told us she knew how to do her job and that we had to pay. We refused and after about a half hour she finally accepted the reality we paid after looking through her booking payments. \n\nThe second situation was in Munich. We walked around the main town square and settled on a steak restaurant to get dinner at. The 4 of us asked for a table, the waiter brought us to a circular table that was no more than 2 ft wide. It was the type of table you would expect if you and a date went to a bar together and wanted drinks. Definitely not large enough for 4 adults to eat steak at. The restaurant was empty other than maybe 2 other parties of people. After trying to make the one table work but failing to have enough room for the plates and drinks for appetizers we pushed over another small table that was a empty a few feet away from us. The waiter who had been ignoring us proceeded to storm over pick my sisters chair up while she was still sitting in it mid bite of food and moved her and the chair back to the original table. I lost my temper at that waiter and let her have a piece of my mind then left to find food elsewhere. \n\nThe Germans I encountered in hospitality while on this trip tended to be self righteous pricks in my experience. The few positive experiences we had at restaurants were from waiters who were originally from Italy.",

I'd like to add my insight tho.\n\nSomeone could say I'm \"German- passing\" when it goes to my look (I'm from central Europe myself) but being in Germany, once people realized what my native language was, I was listening \"funny\" jokes how my people steal, people were rude, I could forget about customer service (not everywhere obviously). \n\nMy friends live in Germany, their kids attend to school there (notice they look similar to Germans, speak perfect/native German due to being born there) and they're getting constantly bullied in school that their parents can only clean their toilet (like if it was something wrong, let's leave the fact that they both have a white collar jobs). Other kids \"joke\" that they have to keep an eye on their belongings when my friends' kids are around etc. I believe that those kids reflect their parents' point of view.\n\nIn my oppinion then SOME! Germans are awfully xenophobic (unless you're from western or northern Europe). In your case you're visibly rather not German so of course you experience it more than white non Germans who can just mind their own business, stay quiet and hope that nobody notice they're foreigners. But we both can't count on being treaten like a random German tourist. \n\nAnyway, I'm sorry you went through this. I hope that other places you're going to visit will be more welcoming!",

But I\u2019ve spent every summer vacation back in Germany visiting family and speak the language without an accent. \n\nI was visiting Berlin and there was a non German/broken English speaking tourist in front of me ordering a Currywurst. The salesperson was rude/ impatient and couldn\u2019t really speak English themselves. When it was my turn I ordered in German of course but made a grammatical error (can I please have two sausage (instead of two sausages)). Instead of just getting on with it and serving me the guy felt the need to correct me (\u201cI believe it\u2019s sausages\u201d with a dumbass smirk on his face). I couldn\u2019t hold back and had to tell him off that I just heard his shit attempt at English and as a bilingual customer the occasional mistake sometimes does slip in. I only spoke English to him when we got to payment. He was pretty miserable",

Taxi drivers tried to swindle me out of \u00a3 by trying to force me to take cash out instead of letting the meter run and pay by card, and they must have thought I wasn't wise to their tricks. \n\nThe service there was quite bad, if I went to eat, I'd get seated, and then ignored. Everyone else got served quickly though so I don't know what was up with that. There was one place where they sat me and didn't give me a menu for at least 5 minutes and I had to ask for one?\n\nThere was a bit of accidental damage at the hotel caused by a knife falling into the door sill of a lift which caused some *very* minor damage to the lift door, like barely noticeable - I was taking breakfast up to my room and tripped and I didn't get to the knife in time before the door closed. Three of them surrounded me when I came down, they got the biggest guy to go to my room with me to get my passport and literally forced a document on me with a pen to sign which was entirely in German and wasn't given a chance to read at all, let alone translate it and they told me I had to pay (but couldn't say how much). I had a panic attack when I got back into my room.\n\n The only thing in English was a description of the incident. I don't know what I agreed to but I was quite frightened by it because of how quickly it happened and signed because of that. They have my details but fortunately, they don't have my bank details on file. I presume this is not the end of it now I am home but you'd better believe I'm going to be instructing a solicitor when shit hits the fan with this one.\n\nGenerally, I found the locals to be quite standoffish and rude. Made friends with Australians, Dutch &amp; Irish people instead that I met. Put it this way, I have absolutely 0 desire to return to Germany, especially Munich. Every other country I have been to in Europe has been so welcoming, I've never quite experienced such disdain!",

Sometimes being solo was an advantage in nearly full places as they could squeeze me in (which obviously a bigger party couldn't do)... sometimes in nearly full places the only tables left were larger ones which they didn't want to give up to a single person. They also tend to \"forget\" you more often as I imagine they get a bit overwhelmed by bigger orders at larger tables. Who knows. If the service is downright bad though, no amount of mental gymnastics in trying to see it from their side will save them from a poorly rated review :)",

We witnessed some wild encounters on the DB train amongst Germans.\n\nI also sensed your point in number one and I looked exactly like them. \n\nI also agree with your point about Berlin.

Lots and lots of americanized hipster barristas that everyone feels are annoying (anyone but themselves).\n\nREAL Berliners are some of the most rude seeming people there are (Berliner Schnauze), but they are honest and loving, just not fake.\n\nSeems to me, that you just don't like (or aren't used to) the German way of talking / living etc., that's probably why you like Berlin better.",

And I spoke to an Indian family in Salzburg where the son was going to school in Germany. Everyone in the family had only good experiences.\n\nAs a white American, I can say that some German clerks are very unfriendly to everyone-even Germans. But there are a-holes everywhere. Don't let it get you down. I had a horrible experience in Salzburg where 95 of the staff I interacted with were grumpy. \n\nBerlin is fine but racism is horrible in the East more than the South. Sorry you didn't like Munich. I hated Berlin because of the German gruffness and general Berliner vibe.",

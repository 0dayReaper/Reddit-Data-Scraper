    "postText": "This is the reason why I chose solo travel. \n\nFive years ago, I went to Europe with my two friends and their other two friends. I\u2019ll call them A, B, C, and D. I am just acquaintances with C and D. We went to London together and initially planned to stick with one another. \n\nThe person A was the lead of the group and  was a very LAZY person. We would party until 1am, and she would come to her room and stay up all night then wake up at 2pm. This was a 3 weeks trip, so there\u2019s no excuse for jet lag. I am NOT a morning person, but I wake up WAY before 2pm. On the third week, I got sick of waiting for her and went to explore by myself since everyone else wanted to wait. She was disappointed that I was LEAVING alone.\n\nB was a very stingy person who refuses to do anything with money. He\u2019s the richest out of all us and got no student loans. He would only eat at subways or cook food. Sometimes I wanted to eat something due to hunger, he would say to just go to our Airbnb and cook. He refused to spend money on museums or anything that cost money but expected everyone to be together. I am traveling to EXPLORE the food, not just McDonald or Subway! \n\nPerson C pissed me off the most. The person legitimately brought 50 dollars to Europe. We all ended buying food for him. He owed me around 120 dollars by the end of the trip, but I didn\u2019t ask him to pay me back. We were all MAD at him. At times when we went out, he would STAY in because he didn\u2019t have money, but he would feel sad and cry. It was so annoying.\n\nD was the least troublesome but also annoyed me. She WALKED so slow. It\u2019s London. She would walk very slow and have conversations with every single person she encountered. I guess that being social is a part of the experience, but she would literally cause us to be late. \n\nThis is why I love solo travel. No bullshit. I can explore anytime I want.",

            "comment": "This is a common problem, unfortunately.\n\nThere's an old George Carlin joke: have you ever noticed that everyone who drives slower than you is an imbecile? And everyone who drives faster than you is a maniac?\n\nPart of the joke is the realization that we're our own measure of normality. And all of us are either imbeciles or maniacs in the eyes of others.\n\nTraveling with people is this joke on steroids.\n\nThe stresses and challenges of travel, combined with being in close quarters with traveling companions 24-7, intensify and exaggerate our differences.\n\nThese differences include personality types, traveling goals and expectations, planning abilities, reliability and punctuality, physical and financial constraints, sleeping schedules, morning routines, styles of decision making, hygiene, temperament, manners, how people handle stress, patience and understanding, tastes in food, preferences in entertainment, partying, drinking, risk taking, toleration of discomfort, etc. etc. etc.\n\nAnd here's another awkward reality: you won't be at your best, either. \n\nEven at the best of times, we're not always happy with our own behavior and choices. So many good intentions, so many failures to follow through. \n\nNow imagination yourself dealing with: jet-lag, stress, exhaustion, and a never-ending stream of problems to solve and decisions to make. So many things to see and do, so little time.\n\nEven if you could travel with an exact clone of yourself, there's a chance you'd have a falling out without your own doppelg\u00e4nger, e.g. you had ambitious goals but were too tired to follow through. Or you chose to see A instead of B, and now regret that choice. That may leave you disappointed with and angry at yourself. \n\nTraveling is a lot harder than most people realize. And traveling with others can be exponentially harder.",

Traveling with others can be fantastic!\n\nThis is its own separate topic, but briefly:\n\nThe upside to traveling with others is that you can share and reduce some expenses, increase your safety and comfort, divide and reduce burdens like planning, provide entertainment and laughs.\n\nSharing an experience with others can make those experiences more memorable, meaningful, and enjoyable.\n\n=&gt; The best people to travel with are people you know well (significant others, lifelong friends) who *also* have traveling experience. Also:\n\n* You should also make sure you have similar goals, expectations, budgets, etc. for a given trip.\n* Make contingencies if someone has to cancel at the last minute (best to have everyone pay for their own big ticket expenses like airfare, hotel rooms, etc. That way, if they cancel they will be arguing with the airline or hotels about refunds, not you).\n* Make an approximate itinerary, with options for group activities and solo activities.\n* Discuss how you will make basic decisions like where to eat, what to do if someone decides they want to do something other than a planned activity, or if someone is running late (or sick) and can't make a planned activity.\n* Make sure you're both comfortable with the option of going your separate ways for the day (or remainder of the trip) if you have different interests.\n\nCooperation and compromise are perfectly fine and normal. But you shouldn't allow yourself to be responsible for someone else's enjoyment of a trip, yet alone entirely responsible for that person's wellbeing, i.e. don't play the role of cruise director or parent.\n\nAnd there should be clear agreement of rules and principles up front that will prevent others from ruining your own goals and enjoyment of a trip.",

                    "comment": "Most of my trips with friends have gone well. A few have gone badly (one very badly)  \nAs is so often the case, clear communication early on can make a world of difference.   \nBut here's one trick that also helps:   \n\n\n=&gt; agree on a rough (penciled in) itinerary in advance, and bring printed copies.  \nBasically, it's a \"do-it-yourself vacation menu.\" It also shifts the focus away from you to the paper.   \n\n\nConsider an analogy where a trip is like dining out.  \n\n\nWould you want to be solely responsible for picking every restaurant every night \\*and\\* ordering every dish for everyone,? Of course not. We all know how hard it can be to agree on a restaurant, yet alone menu items.  \n\n\nThe trip is the restaurant you've all agreed on. Remember that it might be a compromise choice for one or both parties.\n\n  \nWhen you're dining out (on the trip) you want everyone to have their own menu and order whatever they want. Don't order for them!\n\n  \nSometimes you'll order the same things they do. Sometimes you'll share. Sometimes you'll order things the others wouldn't like. It's not a problem, so long as no one is forced to eat things they don't want.\n\n  \nThe benefit of having everyone order on their own: whether they love and hate their choices, the responsibility for those choices will be entirely their own. If they hate a dish, it's their fault not yours. And because you get to order what you want, you won't be forced to share in that bad decision.\n\n  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  \nThe itinerary can be very simple, but should list lots of options.  \nMine was just a simple weekly calendar showing which sights were open on which days, with maps and miscellaneous info attached.  \n\n\nAlthough I did most of the research, I made sure our friends chose the schedule for half the days.\n\n  \nEach day on the itinerary listed 4-7 options, with many of those options repeating on other days. We planned to see 1 or 2 (sometimes 3) things each day. Over 5 days, we might be able to see 7-10 things, chosen from 15-20 total options.\n\n  \nWhy list every day an activity is possible? And why list more things than could possibly be done? Two reasons:\n\n1. It's useful for planning; when a few sights have limited days, or you want to avoid popular sights on crowded weekends, scheduling can quickly become a logic puzzle.\n2. Flexibility to reschedule your itinerary on the fly with little or no stress or extra planning!\n\n  \nCan't see Attraction-A on Day-2 because of rain? You have 4 fallback options listed. And because Attraction-A is also listed as open on Day-4, you can reschedule it. Oh, but Day-4's activity isn't open on Day-2, just Day-3, so you can't just swap of the days. No problem! According to the list, you can move Day-2 to Day-4, move Day-4 to Day-3, and Day-3 to Day-2. \n\n  \nAlso, this may sound like pop psychology nonsense, but having a physical list that you can both look at and physically point to helps to redirect a lot of stress and anxiety away from you as individuals and towards the list itself. It becomes the savior and villain all in one, not you.",

He was the typical white dude American that\u2019s completely oblivious of other culture\u2019s customs and faux pas.

Meet many people all the time and only invest in people who share your mindset. Only make plans with people who have standards. Accept this as soon as possible or you'll always be disappointed. You dont have to spend all your time with the same losers you conveniently met somewhere and those are your only options. If you only know losers than yes, its best to do solo everything. Most people will be a waste of your time but with the right people, anything can be awesome. Got to have standards and expectations. Got to voice those so people are clear and onboard.",

I\u2019m normally stingy at home, but vacation is where I\u2019m willing to spend a few bucks \u2014 my friend wouldn\u2019t eat at a place where a meal cost him more than 12 euro. It was exhausting listening to the endless bitching about paying some \u20ac5 or \u20ac10 to do some attraction. He\u2019s also a drinker while we are not, and while my girl and I will relax midday he is of the mindset that every second on vacation needs to be spent go-go-go-going. It was infuriating by day 18 lol we told him to go into town if he wanted, we were chilling for an hour.\n\nStill love the guy, but needless to say, it\u2019s just my girlfriend and I going to Ireland next summer.",

One of my friends was jobless at the time and so he was broke. I bought his plane ticket and he paid me back, but could barely afford food or anything. I remember one day my other friend and I wanted a good proper breakfast, as we'd been up late the night before and it had been a few long days. But this third friend didn't have the money for it, so we had to eat without him. And instead of just coming in and hanging out to get a drink or coffee or whatever, he just skulked outside of the restaurant. Literally pacing back and forth in front of the doors and windows near our table for like 35 minutes, periodically looking in at us angrily cus we were taking too long. It was fucking... bizarre. \n\nOther than that though, it was mostly good. They were good sports about things and we had a lot of fun. At the time I was a pretty big drinker and neither of them drank at all, so I was worried they'd be wet blankets any time I wanted to head out for a pint, but actually they were totally up for it and ended up having 1 or 2 on a couple of nights. \n\nBut still. The planning and \"maybe I can go\" and stalling and weird restaurant skulking, all shit I am happy to avoid from now on forevermore.",

The program is about to end and I\u2019m about to head out on my own throughout Europe for the first time.\n\nI\u2019ve been to Paris and London with my family and I feel like I\u2019ve done a lot of the top things there already, otherwise I\u2019d spend more time there. If you do have some can\u2019t miss things let me know though!\n\nSome things about me: I\u2019m really into nature, hiking, history, and trying new food\n\nBaden Baden: 2 days\n\nParis: 4 and a half days. 3 of these are going to be at Disney though lol\n\nLondon: 2 full days (should I add a third?)\n\nVenice: 2 days\n\nPisa: literally half a day. Taking an early bus ride from Venice to get here and leaving at night. I kinda just want to see the leaning tower\n\nRome: 2 days\n\nZermatt: 2 days (I kinda just care about seeing the Matterhorn)\n\nWhat are your thoughts/what would you change or suggest?",

Spend an extra day in Paris itself or add one on to London and do a day trip to Bath or Oxford or Stonehenge. Also for Disney, if you like food, try making meal reservations ahead of time on the app, although they\u2019re released months in advance and might be gone if you\u2019re heading there soon.\n\nBear in mind there are strikes at Disneyland atm that could affect your visit, so check the subreddit and @DLPReport on Twitter to stay on top of those.",

It was very fun to see and climb and in my opinion well worth it. \n\nRome always deserves extra days. You can I believe take a day trip to hike Mt.Vesuvius from there too. But the history is just incredible. \n\nI put Milan instead of Venice just to make the travel less dramatic. \n\nI have been to the Black Forest, Italy and Switzerland so if you have any questions lmk!",

If you would still like to revisit, then please give them more time - at least three clear days. Even away from the highlights, both cities have incredible amounts of stuff to see and do - you can even throw in a day trip if you like. From Paris, I can suggest Fontainbleu and Mont St Michel, while from London, I'd recommend Oxford, Cambridge, Bath, Brighton, Durdle Door, or the Seven Sisters Hike.\n\n**Venice: 2 days**\n\nTwo clear days is sufficient, but a little more time will help you see places like Murano and Burano, and give you time in the city when it's not swamped by day tour groups.\n\n**Pisa: literally half a day. Taking an early bus ride from Venice to get here and leaving at night. I kinda just want to see the leaning tower**\n\nYou'll be fine. There isn't much else to see in Pisa, and the town is very small and walkable anyway.\n\n**Rome: 2 days**\n\nMORE TIME. 2 days isn't even enough to scratch the surface of history and food attractions in this city. Vatican alone will take a full day.\n\n**Zermatt: 2 days (I kinda just care about seeing the Matterhorn)**\n\nJust hope the weather is clear in those two days.\n\nI feel you're stretching yourself too thin, and would advise you to cull down to half the number of places. Italy, I feel, will offer you a great mix of all that you're interested in. History is practically everywhere, as is good food - you'll have to do your own homework to figure what you like the most, but apart from Rome and Venice, Florence (and its countryside) would be the obvious third choice. For nature, you can swap out the Matterhorn with some time in the Dolomites (the mountains over there are incredible looking), while for hiking, you can walk along the Cinque Terre coastal paths as well (crazy pretty villages by the sea).\n\nAlso, have you figured how you're going from one place to the next? It looks like you'll be spending a fair amount of money and time on trains / buses / flights. The rest of Europe isn't Germany, so please budget accordingly. Also, be weary of strikes. All the more reason to do fewer places and give each more time.",

Amazing day.\n\nIf you want a nice chill 2-3 hour walk, in the evenings I highly recommend walking from Zermatt to Zmutt (a small hamlet). Zmutt is quite eerie in the evening once everyone is gone and the views are amazing.\n\nI can also highly recommend the Hotel Jagerhof if you look for a hotel. It was one of the cheapest options when I stayed there but was very high quality!",

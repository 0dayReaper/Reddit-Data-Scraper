    "postText": "Hey All\n\nTL;DR:  I plan on starting the Gringo trail next month, but I am unsure if I should start in Mexico, or Guatemala(Or Belize). Few other questions as well :)\n\nThe rest: I'm 26M, and it was almost 5 years since my last solo trip (1 month in Myanmar), a few months ago i had the opportunity to squeeze in 2 months solo in Colombia and that really got my travel itch back. I committed to myself that i'd quit my job sometime in the next year or two to do the \"gringo trail\", however it looks like I am about to lose my job so now appears to be the perfect time to do the trip! I am very fortunate to be in a position where I am not too concerned on budget, only limitation might be homesickness as this'll be my longest trip :). With that being said, i was thinking around 8ish months.\n\nI had a few questions for folks who've done the routes or part of it:\n\n1. I am conflicted though whether to start my trip in Mexico City and do Mexico, or leave it for a separate trip and start out in Central America. I've heard amazing things, however I heard it's quite easy to end up spending months there. My main concern is feeling like i need to rush other portions of the trip; I had 2 months in Colombia earlier this year, so I don't think i'd be spending nearly as much time there this go-around, just hitting some of the spots i missed/like to see more of.\n2. I've heard both to do Brazil and to leave it for a separate trip. Thoughts on that?  I'd love to potentially hit Carnival, maybe as a cap to the trip?\n3. I'd say my Spanish ability is around A2/B1, so i feel fairly confident being able to get around. Though i'd love to do a Spanish school for a bit. Any recommendations for any towards the beginning of the route? I've heard about some immersive ones at Lake Atitl\u00e1n, are those worth it?\n4. I have a DSLR that I've brought on trips in Asia as I enjoy photography, but it seems like this is much less of a move in Latin America due to safety. Does anyone have experience bringing that sort of equipment with them?\n5. Anything else you wish you knew before embarking on it?",

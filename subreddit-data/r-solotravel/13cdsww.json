    "postText": "I am planning on studying abroad in Italy for a semester, so I am required to have a visa. After the visa ends, I want to travel around Europe. Can I do so under the 90 day tourism rule they have? I want to see other countries both in and out of the Schengen area. I am not interested in overstaying in Italy. I plan on returning to the US, but I want to travel some more before doing so.",

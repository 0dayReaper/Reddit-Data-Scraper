    "postText": "I will be traveling in Scandinavia for a week by myself until I can meet up with some friends! I am currently in Oslo and have been to Gothenburg and Copenhagen. I am looking to go hiking. I love nature and mountains and I think my week would be best spent doing that. However, I am having trouble finding accessible national parks by train or metro. Are there recommendations in Scandinavia (preferably Norway) for national parks or hiking trails accessible via public transport? I am unable to rent a car at the moment. Is this possible? Or am I better off (albeit safer) staying in Oslo for the week. I would also be into hiking more north in Central Europe as well.",

Get out on HJerkine and you are in the middle of endless hiking opportuinities. Another alternative is the train towards Bergen and get off somewhere near Hardangervidda",

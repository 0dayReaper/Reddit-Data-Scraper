    "postText": "So, after what seems like a lifetime of idleness, wanderlust and lurking on this subreddit, I've decided to say \"Fuck it\" and bite the bullet and embark on my first solo trip.\n\nIt took me ages to get the confidence to confirm the booking but it's all arranged. I'll be going this weekend, three nights Thursday-Sunday. I chose Edinburgh since it's not so far away as to be daunting but different and rich enough for a good experience.\n\nHonestly, it's like nothing I've done before. I've spent a long time feeling lonely, not helped by the pandemic, and have hardly had any memorable experiences in the past few years. I've not even had the confidence yet to go in a pub on my own. So although I want to explore the world, I'm starting relatively small, but hopefully this will be the first of many.\n\nWish me luck. I'm excited and nervous, but looking forward to meeting new people, seeing some sights, having a few drinks. If anyone has any suggestions for local beers I'd more than appreciate that! Otherwise, advice on hostels and what I shouldn't miss around town definitely won't go amiss!",

Last year I went to Madrid as my first solo trip, I\u2019ve traveled abroad with my brothers before but being truly alone was a completely different experience. From anxiety inducing to confidence building it was a good experience. Being totally alone, having to rely only on yourself. Talking to strangers even though I\u2019m pretty introverted, reading a book in a foreign park, getting table and drink by myself and watching the world go by. Good times.",

Then I would walk to El Retiro Park and read Hemingway and walk around taking photos and people watching. Super peaceful there as far as city life goes. I mostly just walked around the city and took photographs and when hungry would stop at any of the bar/tapas places. I didn\u2019t really have any plan or things I wants to see at first but some things I loved and would go back to are my the church, I think Altar Basilica but I\u2019m not sure, there were lots of gold statues and painting and then a woman began singing and it was quite a magical time and I\u2019m not religious so never really experienced that before.  The Saint Michael Food Market was touristy and probably overpriced but it was cool to see. In the main square where my hotel was there were some musicians playing all day, and a few pride rallies during my time there because apparently there was a homophobic murder that took place when I arrived, besides that everything was great and the pride rallies were fun to experience. \n\nHmm it\u2019s hard for me to say I really just lazed around and drank beer and ate prosciutto and laid around on lawns listening to musicians and walked around parks the whole two weeks. I didn\u2019t do any one particular thing but the whole time there was relaxing. If just say go and wing it. Its a beautiful city. You can see my photos from Madrid on Instagram mrs_dmdc if you want to get a feel for what I saw. You\u2019ll enjoy it though it\u2019s awesome.",

For drinks, they have a pub/bar which is really good, and an opportunity to meet fellow travellers,  The Three Sisters is always a good vibe, but if you want more cocktails and something more upstreet I recommend North 56.",

If you're not feeling their Friday night activities, go see The Gorms play at Whiski Bar down the road.\n\nGo see the HMS Britannia if the weather is nice and you fancy a walk out to Leith, otherwise save it for next time.

The two close friends I\u2019d made in uni got into a relationship and I started to feel outcasted from activities so I started wondering if people travelled solo. I was surprised to find such a huge community online and female only travel groups on Facebook reassured me of my concerns before travelling solo to a place as a woman. I\u2019ve been travelling solo since! Once you put yourself out there, the curiosity and intrigue of wanting to explore other places will soon follow. I still have nerves and anxieties about aspects of solo travelling but I\u2019ve put that down to part of the experience and it hasn\u2019t stopped me wanting to go to other places. I\u2019ve just had an amazing trip to Tromso last month and currently have Milan on the cards for next month! I hope this is the beginning of something special for you! \ud83c\udf89",

            "comment": "Have a couple of recommendations that would suit you going alone in Edinburgh:\n\nIf you like coffee, I still think that the best pour over coffee I have ever had was at Hideout Cafe in Old Town, just by the Castle. Ice cream Mary's Milk Bar in Grassmarket (also just by castle) - they mostly only do odd flavours but they are all absolutely world class.\n\nIf you are there on a Saturday would recommend dropping by the Edinburgh Farmers' Market if its on, some great stuff there, a mix of sweet stuff, baked goods, general farm produce and beers. Might have been arts and crafts stuff there as well, its not my thing so i didn't really look out for it.\n\nA weird left-field choice is The Surgeons Hall museum that really interesting, although if you are squeamish in the slightest avoid it like the plague. I was taken there by my brother who is a doctor, but despite not looking to go into the medical field at all myself it was a unique way to spend a few hours.\n\nFor a proper meal if i had to pick one choice i would suggest The Walnut, its a pretty tiny restaurant, but great food for dinner. Breakfast/brunch i would always recommed Dishoom, its not exclusive to edinburgh but always worth it wherever you are.\n\nYou could easily spend an afternoon walking along the Waters of Leith, the paths are good and solid, and its a 5 minute walk from the centre of Edinburgh. Very scenic, and also veried, the part passing Dean Village almost feels alpine, and the general vibe of the walk is fantastic. Perhaps if you can feel vulnerable walking alone leave this one for midday when there are other people around, despite running through the city it can be relatively secluded and while I never felt unsafe, I could see why others might when its dark etc.\n\nIf you are psychopathic like me, then a swim on Portobello Beach is nice, absolutely freezing but I went in in just jammers in November and am still alive! Other than those any of the standard recommendations that you like the look of will probably be nice. I haven't actually done any of the main touristy things (Castle etc) other than the walk up to Arthurs Seat (which was great, can be done in any footwear if you are athletic, otherwise a decent pair of supportive shoes would be a good idea), so can't comment on them.",

In spite of being touristy, seems a shame to give the Castle a miss if you're already there.",

You\u2019ll fall in love with the city and leave your heart in Edinburgh. \ud83d\ude09 I went to Edinburgh twice and now I\u2019m plotting and scheming to move to Scotland permanently. \n\nMy advice, try haggis! It\u2019s honestly really good. Don\u2019t do hostels in the city centre. It\u2019s expensive. I\u2019d recommend staying just a bit far from the city for good rates. Don\u2019t worry about transportation, the train and buses are easy to figure out. Make sure to visit the Royal Mile! Definitely go say hello to Greyfriar\u2019s Bobby in Greyfriar\u2019s Kirkyard (cemetery). If you\u2019re a Potterhead, pay attention to some of the graves, you\u2019ll see some familiar names.

Decided we wanted to move  to Edinburgh as he went to uni there and knew someone looking for a housemate. Broke up after a month. \n\nI was pretty cut up about it. Was having some mental health issues. Didn\u2019t know anyone and was still looking for a job. I posted there the day after and ended up going for a drinks with a bunch of people and ended up making a really good friend. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a social hostel, Kick Ass in the Grassmarkets is a good one. Walk of Leith, Dean village is a must. You\u2019ll see a lot of good stuff just walking around. Look up the innocent railway as it\u2019s a lesser known spot as it\u2019s away from touristy areas. You can link up the walks. \n\nAs far as pubs and stuff like that. There\u2019s a few good ones. The Basement bar on Broughton Street is a cool, dingey Mexican place. One of my favourite bars in Edinburgh. It\u2019s small, but the staff are ace. Additionally, the same company owns a bar in the grassmarkets. Cold town house. It\u2019s in a old church and has a roof top terrace and sits underneath Edinburgh Castle. They brew their own beer so if you like craft beer, it\u2019s a must. Princes street gardens is behind the castle. Again, stunning views. Go to the shore in Leith. Terchters Landing (I\u2019m butchering the spelling on that) is a cool pub. \n\nThere\u2019s loads to do. I suggest a big walk. Do some research on the pathways around the city. You can easily hit Aurthers seat, the royal mile, princes street, castle, innocent rail way, dean village, water of Leith all in a afternoon. The hike up Arthur\u2019s seat is good on a good day but if the weather is shite, I\u2019d skip it. The view from Carlton hill is way better. \n\nAnywho, I\u2019m zooted and rambling. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I\u2019ll answer after some need shut eye. \n\n*and scene*",

Now I'm in my 70s and fully retired but for years when I travel 45 years ago LOL as a actively really started to travel I always used to feel like I needed a companion. And it is indeed fun sometimes. But I learned way way way back how to do everything by myself and boy did that simplify everything. Now occasionally if I go to Europe for 4 or 5 weeks I will often time orchestrate to meet somebody there for 7 days at a specific place a city a favorite hotel etc whatever and then I am free again. Just a little bit of socialization. I sense your trepidation and your fear but you're going to have a fabulous time. You realize when you go out the door there'll be nobody to hassle with in which direction you want to go or the speed you want to see or do things. You go to a pub eventually you'll have a drink and you'll chat with somebody and everything will be just fine and you'll think to yourself oh my God I'm never going to try to orchestrate too hard to travel anywhere with anybody. I can just pick up and go when I want. I guarantee this will happen. Hey it's great when you're in the same step with a special other or a friend or two and it all works out but always know you can rely on yourself and you'll never be disappointed",

If you're arriving by train, leave the station via the south exit onto market Street, head up Fleshmarket Close (Stairs opposite) and on the right there is a wee pub called Halfway House. If you've yet had the confidence to go to a pub on your own, this will be a great place to start. Small (essentially tiny) and friendly so it won't be intimidating, good drink options, plus being by the station, very used to solo drinkers so would wouldn't stand out at all. From here you can continue up Fleshmarket Close the Cockburn street (may recognise view from avengers if that's your thing) and the royal mile.",

I booked a couple of walking tours. I did a history tour of the Royal Mile and a ghost tour of Greyfriars Kirkyard. Met some friendly people and went for a couple of drinks with the others after the kirkyard tour. It\u2019s a great way to get an understanding of your environment and discover some hidden gems.",

William Wallace fought near by, and it\u2019s in great condition! While you\u2019re heading that way, visit the kelpies, too\n\nDoune castle can be reached from Edinburgh, you might remember it from Monty Python\u2019s Search for the Holy Grail (it\u2019s not only a model)\n\nThe scotch whiskey experience in Edinburgh is literally like Disneyland for scotch, complete with rides. View the largest collection of scotch whiskey, and take a tasting class there. You\u2019ll find not all scotch has that acrid peat flavor.\n\nIf you\u2019re planning on buying a kilt, buy a used one from a rental shop; they\u2019re high quality, lower cost, and only have slight wear.\n\nTake a bus out to Loch Ness!\n\nHaggis is actually really good! It\u2019s sorta like a drier, more herby meatloaf \n\nTry Buckfast, or as they call it, \u2018wreck the hoose juice\u2019 \n\nI stayed at castle rock hostel, it was fine as far as hostels go.",

If you\u2019re up for a hike then go up Arthur\u2019s Seat for some amazing views. Just make sure you wear some shoes that have grip. I learned the hard way and slid down the trail probably 10 times and had to go back to my Airbnb and ask my host to use her washer. \n\nThe hardest thing (for me) being solo in Edinburgh was eating meals. It felt rather awkward eating dinner in a busy restaurant at a table by myself but I lessened the \u201cawkwardness\u201d (it was all in my head, I bet no one cared) by reading a book. \n\nYou\u2019ll love it. There are tourist traps especially around the Edinburgh Castle so beware but it was still a cool area. If you\u2019re a fan of old architecture you\u2019ll be in heaven. You probably already know that by wanting to go to Edinburgh. :)",

Been contemplating going to Iceland this year but for all of a sudden started thinking about going to Scotland first.  \n\nIf going for a week and want a mix of history and nature, what would be the recommended itinerary for a solo traveler?  Thanks in advance!!!!!!!",

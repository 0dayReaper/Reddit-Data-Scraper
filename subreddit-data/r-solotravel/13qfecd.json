    "postText": "Hello!! I'll be travelling throughout the balkans for 30 days in the peak season (yeah...), August. I think I've set on a nice itinerary but I would like to double check with you.   \n\nWhat I like: resting and doing nothing to chill from my day job, sitting at a cafe watching the world go by, wandering and seeing cities with some historical weight and important places, some nightlife, some amount of hiking.   \n\nThe plan:   \n\n|Day|Place|Comments|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|1|Arrive at Mostar|Arrive somewhat late, \"lost\" day|\n|2|Mostar||\n|3|Mostar||\n|4|Mostar -&amp;gt; Sarajevo||\n|5|Sarajevo||\n|6|Sarajevo||\n|7|Sarajevo||\n|8|Sarajevo -&amp;gt; Belgrade|Long trip, lost day (check (*) below)|\n|9|Belgrade||\n|10|Belgrade||\n|11|Belgrade||\n|12|Belgrade -&amp;gt; Pristina|Half a day of travel|\n|13|Pristina||\n|14|Pristina||\n|15|Pristina -&amp;gt; Skopje|Seems like a quick trip|\n|16|Skopje||\n|17|Skopje -&amp;gt; Ohrid|Another quick trip?|\n|18|Ohrid||\n|19|Ohrid -&amp;gt; Vlore|Seems a pain in the ass... I can only find a bus at 4h30 in the morning|\n|20|Vlore|(Check (**) bellow)|\n|21|Vlore||\n|22|Vlore -&amp;gt; Tirana||\n|23|Tirana||\n|24|Tirana||\n|25|Tirana -&amp;gt; Shkoder|Preparing the Valbona - Theth hike|\n|26|Valbona||\n|27|Theth|Doing the hike|\n|28|Shkoder|Arrive at Shkoder from Theth, not worth it to try to travel in the same day I guess|\n|29|Shkoder -&amp;gt; Kotor|Seems a good way to break the \"Shkoder to Split\" leg. Check (***) |\n|30|Split||\n|31|Split|Plane departs from Split|\n\n(*) I can only find Sarajevo to Belgrade night buses, but I don't really like night buses. I prefer losing a day and doing it not inthe night. I found a Sarajevo to Tuzla bus in the morning and Tuzla to Belgrade in the afternoon, anyone has feedback? Is it tricky and can I get stuck in Tuzla for a night? Better go for the night bus?  \n\n(**) About the Ohrid - Vlore leg... I really don't know. After Skopje, I want/need to arrive in Tirana by day 22 (meeting people there). Should I skip some town? I figured Ohrid and Vlore would be good for rest by the lake/beach and Vlore might have nightlife. Any other suggestions? Sarande, maybe? Spending another day in Belgrade or Pristina or Sarajevo and then go directly from Skopje to Vlore? Also, my idea for Vlore is just rest by the beach, meet other solo travellers and party with them, any better place for that? I didn't research much Vlore, but maybe not the best party scene.   \n\n(***) I know Kotor should maybe be another day or two, but I need to get from Shkoder to Split a bit fast to catch the plane. I just figured, splitting the trip into two and spending a night in Kotor.\n\nDoes it feel to rushed, or should I skip something to spend another day or two someplace else? This is the plan for the cities, I'm purposely not planning much for the places themselves and kinda go with the flow. Like Sarajevo I might go to the bobsled track I've seen online, Belgrade I might do a day trip to Novi Sad, stuff like that I'm not so worried about right now, I figure when I get there there will be activities, walking tours, stuff organized by hostels, etc.\n\nThanks!!! A lot!",

That way you also don't have to stress if the bus tickets are sold out or anything like that, you just have some extra wiggle room for your flight \u00e1nd you get to enjoy the beautiful city of Kotor, I really enjoyed climbing the ladder during the morning when all the cruise ships make the city busy, and then enjoy the city itself during the evening/late afternoon when the cruise ships are gone",

            "comment": "Hi! I have just returned from a trip to the Balkans recently. I have a few thoughts for you to consider. \n\nI have not personally been to Mostar but I talked to people who have during my travel and apparently there isn't a lot to do and it has become somewhat a tourist trap, definitely not enough to fill an evening and 2 full days so you may want to consider splitting the time there with a nearby location that could be good for hiking, Sutjeska National Park **is highly recommended.** \n\nBelgrade doesn't offer much in terms of sightseeing. It is a big city with some nice architecture and great places to see but from my experience, one full day and evening were enough to make me think ''Okay, time to move on''. So I would suggest cutting a day. I heard Sarajevo is awesome but I can imagine 3 full days could be too much? I would cut one day from this stop too.\n\nSame comment for Pristina, it's a very young city, nice, chill atmosphere but in my experience there wasn't much to do, there is a Pristina Bear Sanctuary about 25-30 minutes drive from Pristina which I recommend! It was a super chill day trip that can last as long as you want and on the way there are nice spots to stop and just enjoy the scenery. I would keep 1 day for Pristina itself, see the bear sanctuary and roman ruins in Gracanica village the next day and move on. Kosovo was a highlight of my trip and I would recommend spending a day in Prizren. Beautiful city, great hiking opportunities and you could squeeze that in between your trip to Skopje. \n\nWith that you could save \\~3 days and add them to other places such as Kotor like mentioned above. Also worth noting, from my trip to the area, one of the best experiences was the Belgrade-Bar railway that goes through some of the most scenic areas of Europe. I highly recommend you to consider that as part of your trip! You could use one of the saved days for that experience. Note the train takes approx. 12 hours and is often late but the experience is unforgettable.",

                    "comment": "I'm just writing the names of places where I'll stay. I'm guessing Belgrade, with 3 days, maybe it's possible to do a day trip to Novi Sad, and from Pristina maybe a day trip to Prizren? But sleep always in the same place, trying to \"reduce\" the amount of check in and check out. I don't want to be travelling every other day, and Belgrade and Sarajevo are like the \"chill spots\"... \n\nThank a lot for your message!",

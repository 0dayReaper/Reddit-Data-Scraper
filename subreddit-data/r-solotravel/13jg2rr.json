    "postText": "Hi all, I wanted to reach out here and see if anyone has ever done the drive from Maun, Botswana to Victoria Falls and if they\u2019d recommend it. I\u2019m a PhD student who will be in Botswana all summer for the fieldwork portion of my research and want to carve some time out during my time there to do some touristy things. I\u2019ve spent significant time in Botswana before, but never by myself. I want to rent a car and drive to Victoria Falls and stay a few days before returning to Maun. Has anyone done this or would they recommend it for a solo female traveler safety wise? \n\nthanks in advance!",

However, I'm not female.\n\nThere's a few different routes that you can take, although the shortest &amp; most efficient is offroad through a very remote area that I would *not* recommend for a normal passenger car (on the Zimbabwe side).  The Botswana side has mostly decent roads (other than one stretch that was mostly destroyed by flooding, and is 90% pothole for maybe 5km) and services (fuel, food, etc).  Zimbabwe is no where near as well developed, but as long as you get what you need before crossing the border, you'll be fine.\n\nYou do need to allow the better part of a day for the drive but otherwise, isn't bad and is certainly not unsafe in any way. If you feel safe on your own in both countries, then the driving portion shouldn't change matters.",

I'm more than happy to help you in this thread or through PM. The roads are passable. It's a tough drive, but one of the coolest things I have ever done.",

The problem-solving. The 4x4 offroading. Getting stuck and having to figure out how to get out. The landscapes. Racing across the Sua Pan. Camping for 3 nights and then heading into a village to spend the night in a bed, replenish supplies, and have a proper shower. The wonderful people you meet along the way both local and travelers. Coming across other people in need and helping pull their Land Cruisers out of the mud or sand dune. The ancient cave paintings you'd find. Trying really hard not to get eaten by a lion when stepping out to pee. Stopping for beers at 10 am in Letlhakane and mingling with diamond miners just getting off their shift. The solitude and being able to see all of the wildlife is key though.",

I was not alone but I did not feel any danger at all, except that elephant who came close to me while I was going to shower. I did not shower that day haha ! We saw many elephants and even a leopard. I miss Africa so much, enjoy your trip !",

    "postText": "What I mean by this is that you have different interests to the people that you would normally travel with so travelling alone is something you have to do rather than want to do. Is that still considered a solo traveller? \n\nThe reason I ask this is because most of the posts I seem to read on here delve a lot into the hostal, country hopping and the spending months alone part of solo travel. For me its completely different, I usually take two or three 2 week city breaks per year so that means I am in different countries for at least 6 weeks out of the year alone. I also stay in hotels/apartments and not hostals ( at 40 I think I may be too old for that now ha ha) . Could I still class myself as a solo traveller or am I just somebody who goes on holiday by themselves?",

If you like to make a tedious \u201cwar plan\u201d and see 30 cities in a month, then do that. If you want to be social, stay in hostels or guest houses, go to bars, walking tours, meet people online. If you prefer solitude, stay in hotels and don\u2019t talk to anyone.\n\nNone of it matters save for what you enjoy and how you want to spend your time.\n\nSafe travels!",

I\u2019m a 56 year old solo traveler, but it\u2019s a few weeks at a time, largely in business class on miles and points, and always in hotels. Whether one goes in a group or solo, to me, is the least interesting detail about one\u2019s journey. \n\nThis forum skews towards young backpacker types, so that\u2019s why most of the posts are the way they are. When you\u2019re young and don\u2019t have much money, that style of travel is ideal.  To each their own.\n\nIt\u2019s sort of the nature of Reddit in that when the posts start to seem repetitive or annoying, it\u2019s time to maybe unsubscribe and let someone else participate instead.  There\u2019s not going to be any consensus on what\u2019s appropriate here when the sub has 2.6 million members.",

It's actually a recurring debate here whether someone that meets up with people as a hostel is really a solo traveler because they technically travel with others.\n\nTo me someone that doesn't want to go alone but had to because they can't find a partner.. so someone forced to travel Solo against their wishes .. but really anyone that identifies as a Solo traveler is a solo traveler. \n\nIn the purer sense of the term you'd probably qualify more than  the hostel crowd (which I'm 100% a part of and still consider myself a solo traveler)",

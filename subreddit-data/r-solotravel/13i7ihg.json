Was there any trip that you signed up for as a solo traveller, possibly with a bit of trepidation, but it turned out to be a revelation or simply so much better than you originally thought it would be?\n\nThis can be for any number of reasons, eg. socialising as a solo traveller, quality of the tour better than you thought it would be, or just something completely unexpected.\n\nIt would be nice to hear people's good experiences and the more exotic, the better!",

I decided on the tour because I had only passed my driving test a year earlier and the idea of driving abroad terrified me. The tour was great, mostly the same people for the two weeks (it was actually a combo of two one week trips). Spent most of those days hiking together through some of the best scenery in the world and then sitting round a camp fire chatting with a beer in the evenings. I still speak with some of the people I met on that trip.\n\nI don't have many memorable experiences from day tours, they are usually so rushed that you have to maximise every minute at each stop rushing around to get done what you need to do and then wonder how they can fit in the one hour stop at the gift shop or vineyard.",

I noticed they have scaled back their options a lot post pandemic and aren't currently doing the one I took.\n\nThat said don't underestimate the advantage of having your own vehicle and doing such a trip solo as well if you can drive. I went back to this part of the world last year in a rental car and I liked being able to stop at some of the less popular state parks or national monuments that I missed on the tour, as well as deciding how long I want in each place.\n\nPros and cons for both methods of travel I guess. Tried to replicate the group tour experience in New Zealand several years later and it just wasn't the same. Maybe it depends on the luck of the draw with the group you end up with. Going to give it another try next year in Central America as I'm not brave enough to do that area alone.",

The guy at my hotel offered to arrange a private tour guide for me and OH MY GOD it was so worth it.\n\nIt was about $100 for a day with a private guide and driver.  I went to the major pyramids of course, but they also took me to some other pyramids that were deserted and you could actually go into, plus a bunch of other places.  My guide was extremely well educated in everything and explained so many things to me.  I saw lots of people getting off buses and they just kind of wandered around for a bit and got back on the bus.  I was also a single woman traveling and my guide was great at protecting me from any questionable sorts.\n\nA private guide isn't always cost effective or feasible, but in Cairo it was totally worth it.",

Good memories. This was circa 10 years ago but the company is still going, last I checked.\n\nOh, and more recently, I did a terrific tapas food tour in Seville a couple of years ago.

The one in the Balkans because we covered less touristic destinations (Montenegro, Kosovo, and North Macedonia), and visiting local producers was really a great addition to an area that probably would offer less to the average tourist. Jordan because the food activities were on top of the classic activities you would do there, eg we spent a full day in Petra, but we also had a traditional dinner with a local family there. So both tours offered activities I wouldn't have done as a solo traveller. I've now very high on my travel wishlist a 3 weeks food tour in Vietnam and Cambodia with Intrepid.",

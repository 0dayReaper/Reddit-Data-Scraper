    "postText": "Hi travellers. I\u2019m currently less than a week into my South America trip and have had to unexpectedly fill out some paperwork with some important personal information. I have to sign and then scan a form to submit and I\u2019m stumped on how to go about this. I\u2019m in Peru at the moment and can\u2019t find any printing places where I can self serve. You need to either send the document you want to print and scan to the printing store\u2019s email address or bring a USB for the attendant to print it. I\u2019m uncomfortable placing so much trust on a stranger given that this form has my social security number. I\u2019ve considered asking the hostel but I think I\u2019d be in the same situation where I\u2019d need to let hostel staff print and scan it for me.\n\nHas anyone else come across this? Any suggestions?",

Sometimes the forms insist it be all typed though--so that won't always work.  \n\nIf not, it's not really a big deal.  Unless the place is super sketchy, let them put it on a USB and print it out or email it to them.  Social security numbers and DOB are actually not that hard to find or top secret and your average local Peruvian has no use for them.",

I have been to every country in ASEAN excepting Brunei. $10 = 350 THB which would get you a private hotel/guesthouse room almost anywhere in Thailand. $10 would also get you a private room in Cambodia or Vietnam, no problem.\n\nHere in Chiang Mai, the standard dorm bed price is 100THB = under $3. And you can even get a private room for that if you hunt around a bit... I have an apartment now but the last guesthouse I was in I paid 110B ($3.25) a night.\n\nIn general dorms are not a big thing in SE Asia, outside of a few very touristy places, and Malaysia and Singapore because they are more expensive. But where they exist, if you are paying more than $3-4 you are being ripped off, as you can easily get a private room for $10, or indeed for $5 in many places.\n\nI'm aware there are hostels that do sell dorm beds for more than the going rate for a private room, and I guess people stay in them because they book on the internet and they don't know the going rate, or don't care because they are only here for a few weeks or whatever, but they are a rip-off.\n\nI've spent years cumulatively in Cambodia and have got a private room as little as $3 (in Kampot) and have never had to pay MORE than $10 anywhere in the country. And have never stayed in a dorm in Cambodia or indeed anywhere in SE Asia outside of Malaysia or Singapore... no reason to.",

Never pre-book, never use apps or sites.\n\nAlmost nowhere at that price is on the internet.\n\nNote I am not saying that *everywhere* I have ever stayed has been $3-5, that is on the cheap side and I have often had to pay $9-10- but $9-10 absolutely buys you a private room in SE Asia (Malaysia and Singapore excepted).\n\nNote as well I now have a higher budget and I'm not quite so hardcore about trying to keep my accommodation costs to the absolute minimum but even with that I have NEVER EVER EVER paid more than 600THB which is $17.50 and that was for a really nice modern furnished room with AC, nice bathroom, etc.- that's what $15+ gets you here, an actual nice modern AC room.\n\nI have paid $5 or under though in a lot of places, off the top of my head:\n\n* Bangkok 120B / $3.50\n* Chiang Mai 110B / $3.25\n* Chiang Rai, Trat, Kanchanaburi 150B / $4.50\n* Krabi, Koh Chang 200B / $5.75\n* Lots of other places in Thailand 200-250B ($5.75-7.25) - Udon Thani, Khon Kaen, Sukothai, Kampaeng Phet, Bang Saphan, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Ranong, Songkhla, Satun, Pattani, Narathiwat\n* Almost EVERYWHERE else ever in Thailand 300B max ($8.50) - this was basically the common price for a Thai-Chinese hotel. Interestingly in Thailand, the REALLY heavy touristed places it is usually easier to get a REALLY cheap room- the largest numbers of really cheap rooms are in places like Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, even Bangkok- as there is huge competition. In some of the really out of the way places, there can be just the one option, and it's 300B (which is still under $10, but it's double what you'd pay in somewhere with more tourists)\n\n* Hanoi $4\n* Phnom Penh $6\n* Sihanoukville $5\n* Siem Reap $7\n* Kampot $3\n\n* basically everywhere else in Vietnam, I paid 100k = $4.50 almost everywhere excepting a few places. Haggling was essential, they always quote higher in Vietnam and you get them down. Thailand I basically never haggle if it is that cheap, unless I'm negotiating a long stay (a week to a month). Only haggle if it is $10+\n\n* throughout Laos with the exception of Vientiane which is more expensive (I paid $9-10 there) I usually paid 30-50k ($3.50-$6) but \npaid as little as 20k ($2.50)\n\n* Myanmar is usually more expensive, had to pay as much as $25 there (but for two people). But did get a room as little as $5 in a few places.\n\n* Malaysia is significantly more expensive to the point where I usually stayed in a dorm, but I did get a nice little hut in Kuala Terengganu for only 15MYR ($3.50) and even in Penang which is tourist central I did get a private room even with a shower attached for 30MYR ($7)\n\n* Singapore, hostels 100% but I have stayed there in a nice hostel for as little as SGD$12.50 which is $9... this was a really nice bike-friendly place where the owner was a biker and gave a 50% discount for cyclists. But even in a regular hostel in Singapore you can get a reasonable bed for like SGD$15 or so which is $10-11... and this is Singapore, literally one of the most expensive, richest cities on earth. Imagine getting a bed for $10 in NYC, San Francisco, Paris, or London? SE Asia is CHEAP, even the stupid rich parts are CHEAP, Singapore is a ridiculously rich country (significantly richer than almost all of Western Europe) and it's still dirt cheap, relatively, for a backpacker.\n\nIf you have a slightly higher budget and want to sort it online before you get there- Agoda is the answer for SE Asia. It has good prices. That is where I find places if I am paying like $10-20. But if you want $5 you usually have to show up and hunt around. I find it can be useful to look at a map in the likes of Lonely Planet not because you are going to stay somewhere in the book but that it usually gives you a feel for where the accommodation is.\n\nBut again, I was on a very tight budget travelling for many years on zero income... cycling a bike from Europe to Indonesia. In expensive countries I just camped, in my tent. If you have more money and value your time at all, you need to question whether it is worth spending an hour looking around to save $5.",

I mean if you are earning a Western wage though and it's a $5 place or a $10 place, what's $5 to most people? Is it a good use of your time to spend the extra hour walking around trying to save that $5? For many (most) the answer is probably no... and indeed I am not on that budget any more and frequently do just book online and pay more now (like $15-20). I'm just saying you can find private rooms throughout SE Asia for $10 or indeed even half that if you look.",

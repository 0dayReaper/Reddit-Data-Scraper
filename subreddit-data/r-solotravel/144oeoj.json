    "postText": "Europe 3 week itinerary\n\nHey everyone, first time to Europe going in July (July 7-july 28)... My itinerary was basically what's cheapish on Ryanair... Only Rome is booke already and most flights are 7/8 am flights other than Warsaw to Barcelona \n\nMy budget is $5000 everything included (the below itinerary with airplanes plus airbnbs comes to 2.5k already) thanks and hopefully this is more detail to post. Thanks!\n\nI'm flying out of yyz to bcn and bcn back to yyz \n\nItinerary currently:\nBarcelona 7th (noon land) - 12th (8am flight to Rome) (purchased)\nRome 12th- 17th \n17th (flixbus to Venice (takes basically the whole day arrive 11pm) \nVenice 17/18-20th \n20th morning 8ish fly to Vienna Austria\nVienna to Warsaw (25th morning arrive)\nWarsaw-barcelona 27th evening get to airport (11:35..  might stay night and get flight next day at 2ish pm)\n\nIs there enough time in each location should I just scrap Warsaw, is it worth ping Venice to lose a day in the bus? Is it better to take train around Spain and get back to Barcelona sooner. Would love eveyones thoughts and thanks I advance! Feel free to comment and give tips I haven't thought to ask. Thanks again!",

Be ready for the boarding process to start on average 30-40 minutes before the scheduled departure (because they bus people to the remote location a lot). Most airport security takes like 5 minutes. To be safe, plan on arriving at the airport 1.5hrs before your flight. Most airports in the South and Germany are very efficient. Those are the ones I\u2019m familiar with. Have a great trip!",

You say you have a lot of 7am flights - that means getting to the airport before 5am, so probably taking taxis to areas way outside of the city center. Are you sure adding that up is worth the price difference of the flight?",

Last year I barely made it to my flight in Dublin, and had excessive security lines in Dubrovnik. And then two weeks ago in Madrid, just the taxi line took over an hour. If you factor in the 2 hour rule for the airport (and it honestly needs to be 3 in some places), plus you consider how far most airports are from the city center, flying between all these cities will be a huge pain in the ass.\n\nMeanwhile you can roll up to a train station 10 min before departure and still have time to grab a coffee.",

You can totally get a train from Rome to Florence and Florence to Venice. Way better and faster than traveling by bus.",

Other than seeing the tower, I found Pisa rather disappointing. Bologna is really lovely and has so much more to offer + is less touristy/a bit more authentic imo (defititely check out the Teatro anatomico). Huhe but compact old town, so doable in 1 day.\n\nBologna to Venice is like 15 hrs. by train (prob. less by fast train/Frecciarossa)",

I'd definitely suggest you to skip Vienna and Warsaw on this trip, and focus on seeing a little more of Italy and Spain instead. You could save yourself a flight or two in the process as well. In any case, I wouldn't push you to do more than 4-5 cities. In Italy, the region around Florence is a good place to break the trip from Rome to Venice, while in Spain, I find Andalusia to be the highlight alongside Barcelona. Madrid is great too. \n\nIn terms of your budget, please also factor in a small amount of money towards the cost of airport transfers. Many low cost flights use airports that often cost substantial money and time to reach, even by public transport - I remember buying a 5 EUR ticket on Wizzair from Paris BVA to Prague, and spending 20 EUR on the bus from Paris downtown to BVA airport SMH.",

Not sure what your accommodations are looking like but the closer to city center the more expensive.   We payed about 250 cdn per night at a nice abnb.  30 min cab ride to city center that cost about 50 cdn each way.  The coliseum and Vatican are pricey as well. \n\nVenice is pricey as well.  Paid about 150cdc for a very descent abnb.  We found all through Italy dinners cost around 100 to 150 cdn for 2 at great restaurants with appys, wine, deserts, tips and taxes in.  There are cheapers ways to eat for sure but we wanted to do great Italian dining experiences.  And they were great!!!  2 days in Venice is all you need.\n\nVienna was again expensive.  We found even the transportation was pricey.  20 cdn for a train ticket downtown. 100 cdn for parking for a day.  All these places you have to pay to see a cathedral, palace, castle, museum, ect ect.  And you are going during peak season so book your tourist attractions now otherwise you wait in line for a long time or you pay extra for skip the line tix if you can get them. \n\nWe rented a car which was the best!!!!  It cost 1300cdn for 20 days plus fuel and tolls and broke our driving down to no more than 4 hrs per day plus you get to stop and check out things like national parks, castles, caves ect along the way.  I had a budget of about 7k and ended up spending around 9k cdn but didn't really cheap out on anything.  By renting a car we ended up spending 8 days in the country side of tuscany which was the best part of the trip for sure.  Driving the hills and checking out the cool old villages was amazing and got to do everything on our own schedule.",

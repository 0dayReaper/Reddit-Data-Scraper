    "postText": "I\u2019ll be going to Palawan for 6 days/5 nights as part of my trip through the Philippines. I\u2019m flying into Coron and out of Puerto Princess, but I\u2019m planning on splitting my time between Coron and El Nido.\n\nI\u2019ve heard amazing things about the Tao Expeditions 3D/2N trip from Coron to El Nido, which goes through more remote islands than the day trips. However, if I do that trip, I\u2019ll have only one half day in Coron and one full day in El Nido outside of the trip.\n\nFor anyone who\u2019s been, is it still worth doing the longer expedition between Coron and El Nido or are there must sees in either place that I need more time for? I\u2019m not a huge fan of chilling on the beach, I\u2019d much rather do activities like hiking, snorkeling, island hopping etc.\n\nAny other advice for Palawan?",

            "comment": "Following with interest as I'll be doing the same early next year.  I was thinking about Tao as well.  There was also another company that does the same.. it's a bit less expensive but the name eludes me right now..\n\nDoes your half day on coron allow you time for a half day expedition?  Also how flexible are your plans?      From my research it feels like the tao expedition island hopping could be better than the day tours since less people around.     But that's just me taking an educated guess.\n\nI plan to fly to coron .  Take a 3D expedition down to El Nido.  Hang ln El Nido a few nights.    Make my way to South Palawan (not sure yet). Then hop on a plane at Puerto princessa to dumegette to chill on siquijor for a bit until I make my way to sargao.     From there I'll decide what to do next.   Which could be spend more time on Palawan if I really enjoyed it.    \n\nSeems like in the PI you need to have some flexibility.      Last thing u want is to rush because of an itinerary ..   leave room for spending more time at a place if needed \n\nGood luck and hopefully you keep your post updated",

I only gave myself one night each in El Nido and in Corona and definitely wished I'd left another night for Coron to see the sights. El Nido not so much since we saw plenty of beaches and snorkeled a lot on the boat trip. Did the larger sailboat btw, and it was worth the extra expense.",

            "comment": "Thanks everyone for the advice! I decided to sign up for Buhay Isla, since it was cheaper than Tao and still had good reviews. However, everything got cancelled due to poor weather (both the day island trips and the 3 day expeditions), so I didn\u2019t get to do it. Hope I can come back some day to try it, everyone I met who did the expeditions loved it",

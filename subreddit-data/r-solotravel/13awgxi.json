    "postText": "I like adventures, and I've always wanted to drive the mountain roads of the Andes. Many discouraging posts from various forums did not discourage me from renting a car in Peru. I am also somewhat socially awkward, so driving in my own rented car feels so much more comfortable than on a bus. And I get so much more freedom to explore places off the beaten path with my a rental car.\n\nHowever, during my planning, I realized 9 days in Peru is not enough to drive from Lima to Cusco and back and see everything I want to see. So, unfortunately, I had to split the road trip into two trips, one from Lima and one from Cusco. If I had more time, I would have definitely driven to Cusco from Lima.\n\nIn Cusco, some attractions really don't make sense to access by car, such as Machu Picchu, Ollantaytambo, Moray, and Maras. Machu Picchu has so much logistics and reservations involved that it is just so much easier in a group day tour. Moray and Maras can explored on an ATV tour for only $25 USD. But I visited most other destinations in a rental car :)\n\n\\*Budget:\\* Lima: $140 car rental + $100 gas/tolls, Cusco: $120 car rental + $30 gas\n\n\\*Trip Length:\\* 5 days with a rental car, 3 in Lima, 2 in Cusco\n\n\\*Destination(s):\\*\n\nFrom Lima: Huacachina, Nazca Lines, Pampa Galeras, Paracas, Tambo Colorado\n\nDay 1: Pick up car at 9am from Sixt Miraflores -&gt; Tambo Colorado -&gt; Nazca. This drive is much easier in 2023 than some forums describe. The Pan American Highway can be driven at 100 km/h from Lima to Ica. After Ica, it is no longer a divided highway, but Google Maps estimate driving times are still accurate. I had to pay some 'cash fines' to the police at a toll booth because I forgot to turn on my headlights, but that was the only trouble I had with police during my entire trip.\n\nDay 2: Nazca Lines tour by plane, Nazca local attractions, Pampa Galeras (up to before toll booth) -&gt; Huacachina. I saw some vicunas in Pampa Galeras, but they were all moving too fast and too far away for me to get any good photos :(\n\nDay 3: Huacachina -&gt; Paracas National Reserve -&gt; La Mar restaurant in Lima -&gt; return car at Sixt Miraflores. Paracas National Reserve is laid out just like many US National Parks, you drive into the park and drive to the various attractions inside. The desert landscape with huge cliffs right next to the ocean is so beautiful, and I even saw some Humboldt Penguins. Some people will say I'm crazy, but I actually really wanted to drive in Lima after reading the posts about how crazy it is to drive in Lima. It wasn't that bad for me. Honking the horn randomly every once in a while was the most fun part of driving in Lima.\n\nFrom Cusco: Pisac, Tipon, Pikillacta, Cuyuni Pass, Rainbow Mountain Cusipata, Andahuaylillas\n\nDay 1: Cuzco Rent A Car delivered the car to my hotel at 9 am -&gt; Pisac Town -&gt; Pisac Archeological Site -&gt; Tipon -&gt; Pikillacta -&gt; Cuyuni Pass -&gt; Cusipata. Driving in the Cusco area feels very different compared to Lima. The scenery is so stunning everywhere you go. Viewpoints are dotted along the mountain roads, which you can only access in your own rental car. There are less police checkpoints. I was the only tourist in at Tipon Archeological Site, and I only had to share Pikillacta with one other car. I am guessing you probably haven't heard of Cuyuni Pass, because that is not somewhere most tourists go to. In fact, it wasn't in my original plan. On my way from Pikillacta to Cusipata, I stopped at a roadside shop to buy a bottle of water just past Urcos. Then I looked around and saw the sign for Carretera Interoceanica, Sao Paolo 4600 km. I looked at Google Maps and found out that there is a 'Mirador de Ausangate' if I drive up that road. I asked the shop owner, and she strongly recommended me to visit. Then this turned out to be the best drive I did in Peru. After probably more than 100 switchbacks, I got to the top of the mountain and had a beautiful panoramic view of the surrounding valleys and snow-capped Ausengate mountains.\n\nDay 2: Cusipata -&gt; Rainbow Mountain -&gt; Andahuaylillas -&gt; Cusco\n\nI left the hotel at 7:30 am to arrive at Rainbow Mountain before the crowds. Turns out I did not leave early enough... But the drive on the dirt road felt much safer when I could follow a tour van. When I got to the parking lot, it was already packed with tourist vans and buses, and I was one of the only 4 small cars there. Hiking up Rainbow Mountain alone was very safe and comfortable, because I was constantly asked by the locals with horses if I wanted a ride. There were so many vendors selling snacks and coca tea along the way. Although this hike's altitude is very difficult, it was not difficult overall, because the availablity of so many services. I got back to the parking lot at 1 pm, and most tour buses have left. The drive back to Cusco was a nice relaxing one, with a stop in Andahuaylillas to see the San Pedro Ap\u00f3stol church.\n\n\\*Accommodation:\\* Cheap hotels with parking\n\n\\*Activities:\\*\n\nActivities reached by driving: Paracas, many archeological sites, viewpoints, Rainbow Mountain hike, Vicuna-watching\n\n\\*What Went Right:\\* pretty much everything. Waze worked better than Google Maps. Parking was not an issue at all the places I visited.\n\n\\*What Went Wrong:\\* My plan for the 3 days with a rental car from Lima was too tight. I got caught without headlights on, and had to negotiate the 'cash fine' down to 200 Soles from 1000 Soles. Then I realized I didn't need to pay the officer at all and I should have asked for a real ticket to be paid at Banco Nacional.\n\n\\*Recommendations:\\* If you are not afraid to drive in places without strict driving rules, and you want to explore off the beaten path, you should rent a car in Peru too! However, all the main tourist attractions can be reached by public transportation, day tours, or PeruHop at a much smaller cost than driving a rental car.\n\n\\*Pictures!:\\*\n\n[Rainbow Mountain Trailhead](https://i.imgur.com/fJ8vtxt.jpg)\n\n[Carretera Interoceanica Sur](https://i.imgur.com/22nnLId.jpg)\n\n[Old Panamaricana Mountain Pass](https://i.imgur.com/FJ96nDG.jpg)\n\n[Lima Beach Freeway](https://i.imgur.com/QEHyxuJ.jpg)\n\n[Lima Traffic](https://i.imgur.com/ZCT43BR.jpg)\n\n[Rainbow Mountain Dirt Road](https://i.imgur.com/uUfjV6W.jpg)\n\n[Rainbow Mountain Dirt Road Views](https://i.imgur.com/R0ufO8j.jpg)\n\n[Rainbow Mountain Peak](https://i.imgur.com/tAUyTfZ.jpg)\n\n[Paracas National Reserve Penguins](https://i.imgur.com/gORiksl.jpg)",

    "postText": "So I'm trying to organize a 3/4 day stay in a tample in Korea. Goal is mostly to shut off from the world and meditate, maybe take part with eating/prostrating with the monks as well.\n\nI've tried researching templestays website, as well as asking other travellers, and visiting the national templestay office in Seoul. But I constantly get conflicting information. Also lots of the information I find is for 2 day 1 night guided tours with a group of foreigners where you're constantly doing activities. This is not for me. I just want to isolate myself in a temple. I was even told to just visit a random temple without notice and to stay for free for a few days. This seems sketchy. \n\nPlease reddit, do any of you have experience in doing something similar. Can you point me in the right direction.",

            "comment": "That temple website is the site you need to book your temple stay through.  \n\nI have never seen a temple stay in Korea for foreigners that is prolonged and any without activities. With the language barrier, it's not something they offer as most temples don't have monks that are fluent/ speak English. I have only been able to talk to volunteers when visiting most temples in Korea because of this.\n\nIn fact, I have had friends book a stay and get an email canceling their booking because the temple they choose no longer has english speaking monks. \n\nAs for showing up if the person hadn't done it themselves specifically in Korea, I don't think I would recommend it. Korean culture and Korean Buddhist culture is different than other Buddhist cultures so I'm not sure if they will be willing to accommodate you. I would recommend calling the Korean Tourist helpline they can book one for you.\n\nIs there a reason your set on Korea for this?  Korea is not known as a Buddhist country with only 17% of the population who are Buddhist and a high percentage of those people are over the age of 50.",

            "comment": "I would choose another country that \n\n\\- Has a larger Buddhist community\n\n\\- Has higher levels of English / comfort with foreigners\n\nMy friends have done Buddhist retreats in India and Thailand. \n\nKorea is a nice place to visit, but it really only opened to tourists in the past generation or two and is mostly selling a K-pop / shopping type experience. The language and cultural barriers alone would make any real Buddhist retreat nearly impossible.\n\nAlso, Korea is really not that Buddhist, even though there are some lovely temples. It's not even that easy for find true Buddhist vegetarian restaurants, much less entire retreats. \n\nAlso remember that temples are primarily for local monks' / nuns' private religious purposes. They have no obligation to take in curious tourists.",

I think this is right up your alley; if there's no retreat in progress you should be able to join for a few days, participate in the morning and evening schedules, and do your own bowing practice in the Zen room or up the hill in the gorgeous Dharma hall.\n\nThe city center [Hwa Gye Sa](http://www.buddhism.org/the-seoul-international-zen-center/) in Seoul also has great practice and teaching, but also more traffic from members and visitors.",

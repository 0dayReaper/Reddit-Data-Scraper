    "postText": "Hello r/solotravel I am an 18-year-old about to embark on my first one month solo trip to Europe in June. I have planned out my itinerary and would love for some feedback and advice from experienced travelers.\n\nHere is my itinerary:\n\nMarseille: June 4th - June 6th\n\nNice: June 7th - June 10th\n\nMonaco: June 11th\n\nGenoa: June 12th - June 14th\n\nMilan: June 15th - June 18th\n\nTurin: June 19th - June 21st\n\nLyon: June 22nd - June 24th\n\nVichy: June 25th\n\nParis: June 26th - June 30th\n\nI am particularly interested in hearing about any hidden gems or must-see attractions in these cities. I am also curious to know what people think about Couchsurfing as a budget-friendly option for accommodation. Have any of you tried it before? If so, what was your experience like?\n\nAdditionally, I would love to hear recommendations on the best mode of transportation between these cities. As a budget-conscious traveler, I am looking for the most affordable and efficient way to get around. I have looked into trains and buses, but I am not sure which one would be the better option for each leg of my journey.\n\nThank you again for taking the time to review my itinerary and offer any advice or suggestions.",

Milan and Turin are not the two cities I would choose to visit for on a first trip to Italy. Four days in Lyon may be a bit much. I would keep things super flexible and wing it.",

Beaune is a lovely winery town not far from Lyon. Rent a bicycle and ride the vineyard paths to nearby villages. Arles is an old Roman town not far from Marseille where Van Gogh lived, lots of history.",

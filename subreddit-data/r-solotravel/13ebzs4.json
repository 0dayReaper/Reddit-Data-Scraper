So I bought a flight to Vietnam for 2 days later and completely changed how I intend to spend the next 2 weeks. This isn't usually an option when you travel with others, and it's easy to forget when you are solo that you can literally do anything you want.",

You want to do the aforementioned? Cool - good stuff! But you want to go see the major \"touristy\" sightseeing destinations - equally fine. As an aside - my experience is that the top tourist destinations are usually touristy for a reason... because they typically *are* the coolest/most impressive things to see.

I suggest starting with a small trip like 2-3 weeks to test out the solo travel waters and if you like it, change the length next time but don\u2019t just jump into a 3 month solo for your first.",

I get 5 standard weeks off work each year and whilst I can get more I have to lose salary for them so not practical to get an extra 2 months. Besides asking for 3 months off at once isn't going to work either. Although my company does allow you to take a sabbatical once you've been there a couple of years. Tempting but I've already seen most of the countries I wish to visit on dozens of 1-3 week trips over the years. You don't have to see half the world in 3 months.\n\nAnd maybe that's my advice for this thread, spread things out more so that you constantly have trips to look forward to. I have two more planned for this year and I'm currently planning out next year.",

Don\u2019t take everybody at face value or believe their claims or back them up just because you\u2019re from same country or are a fellow traveller.   Be safe, &amp; enjoy adventures!",

                            "comment": "There was the Canadian lad who sat in a Thai jail for 10 days with a fractured arm &amp; cheek-bone he'd had the shit beaten out of him by locals - **he\u2019d rented a bike &amp; lent it to some other \u2018backpacker\u2019 who told some sob story** his gf had left him he needed to go find her, but he just took off with it &amp; premeditatedly stole it.  The rental dudes wanted their money &amp; Canadian wouldn\u2019t give up the $6,000 so they beat shit out of him &amp; called the cops.  They were all trying to extort the $$ out of him, took ages for people (other backpackers) to even find where he was &amp; to contact his embassy &amp; try get them involved to come help &amp; get him out &amp; to hospital &amp; all the rest of it.\n\nThe Scandinavian young lady in India who \u2018lent\u2019 her \u2018boyfriend\u2019 $500 to 'start a tourist cafe\u2019 sob story and he started with pot getting her stoned, then giving her opium which very immediately progressed to heroin while he was taking her to the ATM machine every other day. When he\u2019d cleaned out her bank account of her life savings he started prostituting her to his friends &amp; then the locals AND some local corrupt cops as bribes to look the other way &amp; keep the whole scheme going.  That took a few of us concerned travellers MANY calls to her embassy a thousand miles away to come intervene, they\u2019d actually been receiving calls from worried family back home cos they hadn\u2019t heard from her in weeks/months and then had received thru the mail her bank statements that she\u2019d been cleaned out. We\u2019d tried multiple interventions with her when this dude started giving her opium but she wouldn\u2019t listen to us told us to mind our own business &amp; not talk shit about her boYfriEnD. EVen other locals had tried talking with her n all, warning her about him, **and warning us to be very careful about trying to intervene, he was making tons of cash off her &amp; would target us for some back-street beatings or worse.**  Embassy had to get her family members to come intervene when non-corrupt cops arrested her for prostitution &amp; drugs. It was in local newspapers n all.  Tbf, the non-corrupt cops absoutely did her a favour arresting her for prostitution cos the \u2018bf\u2019 was most definitely not far off from selling her into slave trade in some other city, so that he could appear to be just a regular \u2018backpackers cafe owner\u2019 &amp; start targeting next victim, one who had thousands of $$ in a bank account back home.  As all the locals near &amp; far had had a go with her already, her price was dipping down anyways - less novelty.  So callous. She was a firm heroin junkie at that point (oh more than a month this giving heroin + prostitution thing had been happening) and probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to get herself out at ALL, would have ended up as one of those \u2018disappeared without a trace\u2019 backpackers.\n\nThe Greek lady who had her whole years-worth of savings working illegally in Tokyo bar-tending stolen by the Iranian \u2018boYfriEnD\u2019 &amp; his buddies in Thailand when they gave her some sob-story they were **trying to get asylum (this was back in the 90\u2019s) from UK embassy down in Singapore &amp; would she accompany them to put in good character references for them with the embassy,** come down with them on the sleeper train.  She was woken up by train attendants alone with all her luggage gone, they\u2019d drugged her &amp; stolen everything &amp; took off.  That was a long-con.  \u2018Bf\u2019 had come with her from Tokyo cos she\u2019d talked with him about how she had all this illegal work money in cash cos she would only be in Bangkok for a week before returning to Greece &amp; she\u2019d get better value for cash exchange Yen - drachma in Athens.  So, she was left there in SEAsia almost without a penny - she had to beg from other backpackers for train fare back up to Bkk &amp; for accommodation &amp; food money while she waited fr her flight. She had no family back in Greece &amp; was landing back there penniless after a years hard work in Tokyo.\n\nThe British dude who had shit kicked out him &amp; a few thousand pounds extorted cos he'd tried to heLp another backpacker who\u2019d rented a bike &amp; then hit a local kid who was on the ground with broken limbs - **he tried to intervene when locals were kicking shit out of the driver dude for the accident,** so the crowd turned on him too &amp; he also got carted off to jail, bleeding, &amp; his buddies had to run around getting money together to bribe him out of jail &amp; get him to hospital n all.  Nobody could even help the backpacker driver who\u2019d hit the kid, that was embassy-grade help.\n\nThe Kiwi dude who had his bungalow door chopped down with hatchets weilded by local drunks who were trying to get to the British girl who\u2019d \u2018lent' the one Thai guy a few thousand $$ to rent these backpacker bungalows &amp; restaurant, after 6 months she kept asking him for the money back but he wouldn\u2019t give &amp; turned increasingly drunk &amp; violent on her so she did a runner &amp; went into hiding &amp; was waiting for a boat off the island, **had begged for refuge from this Kiwi dude, telling him her boYfriEnD was beating up on her.**  Which he WAS.  To get her to fuck off &amp; stop asking for the money back.  Yeah Kiwi dude also had shit kicked out of him &amp; had to immediately pack up what was left of his belongings &amp; immediately leave the islands.\n\nSo yeah.  Just need to be very careful intervening or \u2018helping\u2019 - or even hanging out with - some people.  It\u2019s not just \u2018lost some bucks to a scamer\u2019-grade stuff goes on out there.   :(",

Some of my best travel experiences were spontanious ones.\n\n\\- If you want to be social, don't sit there on your phone, smile and be approachable, after a short while it will become second nature making new friends.\n\n\\- Enjoy every second, it goes so fast, especially when you hit your 2nd half!",

When traveling with another or in a group you really don't have to be as outgoing and can huddle in your own little world while traveling. For me there are too many down sides to that, but I do realize that in order to meet new people I have to make the effort and it can get tiring. It can also be extraordinarily rewarding. So know you will have to make an effort, on top of dealing with various mishaps. But the sense of freedom when traveling solo is to experience real freedom that others can only dream about.",

I found that on my trip that I really enjoyed some bad memories came up that I had to process after ignoring them the first time around when it was so recent! What helped me was meditating the nights where this happened and I was able to sleep much better. All in all, I had a great trip and would do it again! I find that solo traveling made me more confident in myself and I was able to ask for help from others more freely than I would have had I been with a partner or group. I think it\u2019s a great growth opportunity and something that everyone should try but just know that it\u2019s normal for some stressful memories to pop up now and then when you\u2019re alone since you have much more time to reflect in peace!!",

There is stuff to do on the island but it\u2019s all very touristy. \n\nCon dao is a great little island with a lot of interesting history, just not as lavish as PQ. There are even smaller islands you can go to if you want to try something special. \n\nThe whole Mekong area is amazing and it just depends how comfortable you are with being uncomfortable- you can go to little towns with barely any tourists if that\u2019s your thing. \nLook into- Chau Doc, vinh long, soc trang (can take the ferry to con dao from here)\n\nLots of nice central towns- nha trang is fine but Qui Nhon is nicer and quieter.\n\nIt all really depends what you are looking for. Feel free to ask me more I\u2019ve been living here 5 years and have travelled all over the country.",

There are beautiful natural / tourist sites peculiar to each place that are not similar to any places elsewhere in Vietnam, for example Eo Gio in Quy Nhon. A typical itinerary lasts for 3 days for both places. I believe now is also the ideal time to visit this area weather-wise. I don\u2019t have much knowledge on the transport facilities though.\nHave fun and welcome to Vietnam. :)",

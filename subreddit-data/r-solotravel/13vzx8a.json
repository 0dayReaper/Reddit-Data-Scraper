    "postText": "Hello travelers! I\u2019m a 26yo American woman going to Kenya for the month of July. The first part of my trip is set, as I\u2019ll be walking across the Maasai Mara to Ochuna with an organization, but I\u2019ll have about 6 days to myself after we return to Nairobi. \n\nA little background abt myself: I\u2019ve been traveling internationally with my mom and sister since I was 11 to places like Bali, Italy (to see family), Morocco and Mexico. I feel confident in my travel ability, however this is my first solo trip and first time to east Africa. I\u2019m very excited and a wee bit nervous. \n\nI am thinking about going to Mombasa for those 6 days and would love to hear any recommendations, things to be aware of/avoid as a solo woman, things to do, where to stay etc. Things I enjoy are food, cultural events, shows, bodies of water, nature, meeting other travelers, and nightlife, to name a few. After backpacking across the Maasai, I anticipate wanting a bit more comfort lol, although my standards aren\u2019t super high, as long as it\u2019s clean and safe. My budget is flexible but not extravagant. I\u2019d ideally love some place clean, with basic necessities, a private room, and ability to meet other travelers. \n\nI\u2019m open to traveling to nearby towns for more secluded, pristine beaches, but want to be sure that what I\u2019m doing isn\u2019t putting me in harms way. I wasn\u2019t planning on getting a Kenyan SIM card (so I won\u2019t have service outside of WiFi) but I\u2019m open to it if it makes a big difference getting Ubers and such. \n\nI\u2019ve also considered going to Kisumu or somewhere on the shores of Lake Victoria, but don\u2019t know as much about this area. \n\nAny and all recommendations/advice is welcome! Thanks!",

            "comment": "Hi, Kenyan here who is also a female solo traveller. \n\nI would avoid north coast in Kenya (as the beach isn't quite nice and no vibe there). South is beautiful - I would go with either Diani or Watamu via flight from Nairobi as it's not that expensive of a flight.\n\nDiani - there are a couple of hostels so you should be able to meet some backpackers/solo travellers (one is called Diani backpackers) and you can enjoy the beach, hostel vibe, maybe get some diving in (although the water isn't too clear in Diani). \n\nWatamu - you'd have to get off at Malindi airport then take a 20 mins taxi to Watamu - there aren't any hostels here but the beach is slightly better and really calm water. I did some diving here which was better than Diani. \n\nIf you're keen on Kenya then I'd recommend Diani for your trip as you'd get more of a backpacker vibe there. \n\nAlternatively, you can take a flight to Zanzibar (Tanzania) if you can afford it (should be around \u00a3400) there is a hostel there and the water is pristine and the best beaches! Diving here is supposedly phenomenal. \n\nWhether you do Diani or Watamu - it is very safe,  just be clever about your travel ways (i.e don't wear flashy jewelry, don't carry your phone on your hand, bag infront of you rather than back and when people say \"Muzungu\" (means white) don't give them attention, just keep walking and they won't bother you. \n\nI would recommend getting a sim card for your duration as it will help to contact people in Kenya e.g staff at hostels/hotels and easier to book an Uber. Plus it's cheap and getting data is cheap too.\n\nHope you have a great time, Masai Mara is paradise! I go every year and haven't gotten sick of it! Something magical about seeing animals in the free and not caged, as it should be :)",

It\u2019s a relaxing way to see a pretty big swath of the Kenyan countryside, &amp; cheaper than flying. Definitely get a Safaricom SIM card. The data rates are cheap, and it enables a pay-by-phone system called mPesa. It\u2019s accepted virtually everywhere and reduces dramatically the amount of cash you need to carry around. \nIf you decide to fly to Tanzania from Mombasa, it is much cheaper than \u00a3400. I did it in February for about $100USD.",

Great to know about the \"Muzungu\" thing. \n\nLooking at a map, it looks like Diani is about 1.5hrs south from the Mombasa airport; would you recommend getting a taxi (or train? bus?) from the airport and going right to Diani (or Kilifi, as others recommended) or splitting my time between Mombasa and Diani? I realized I only have 4 days (could possibly push it to 5); would it be worth it to check out Mombasa and then go to Diani or Kifili, or would you suggest skipping Mombasa and going right to the smaller towns, given my limited time?\n\nThank you for the recommendations!!",

I'd personally skip it and get a direct flight from Nairobi to Diani. \n\nKilifi is great during occasions like new years eve, had gone mid year a while back and it was quiet (might just be a rare case) so just check reviews of the hostel in Kilifi and see if many people have stayed recently so you can get an idea of if you'll meet people there. \n\nIf you're still intrigued by Mombasa given your time (4 to 5 days) you can definitely do it. (May be land in Mombasa, get a taxi to a hotel and spend the night there. Do a little bit of sight seeing the next day then head to Diani via taxi (you will have to cross to South coast via ferry in the taxi and there will be quite a lot of traffic) maps says 1.5 hours but sometimes it can be much longer (like 3 ish hours). You can spend the rest of your time in Diani and then get a direct flight back to Nairobi:)",

I stayed at diani backpackers and it\u2019s a good vibe with clean facilities and a really good inexpensive massage if you want some of that R&amp;R after your trip! Diani is beautiful but if you can swing a flight to Zanzibar, I\u2019d recommend that over anything because that\u2019s truly paradise. Stay at drifters or your Zanzibar place. There\u2019s also more to do/see in Zanzibar than in Mombasa in my opinion. \n\nAs far as Nairobi goes, definitely get a SIM card. It\u2019s not safe to walk a lot of places and you\u2019ll want to call an Uber or bolt depending on what time of day and what part of town you\u2019re in. I\u2019m staying at Khweza bed &amp; breakfast in a private room for $20/ night and there\u2019s an amazing free breakfast! The staff are so nice and the facilities are clean. I\u2019d also try to check out the elephant nursery (book ahead of time) and the giraffe center. I had a taxi driver who took me around the whole day and you can feel free to dm me for his contact if you\u2019re interested - he\u2019s great :) also, don\u2019t wear anything valuable! I got my grandmas necklace ripped off my neck and stolen yesterday. \n\nIf you have time between Maasai Mara and Nairobi, stop in Navaisha for a night and stay at camp carnellys. You can rent a bike and cycle hells gate National park (inspiration for pride rock in the lion king) and ride right next to zebras, warthogs, giraffes, etc! Let me know if you have any more questions and safe travels",

Researching he Diani Backpackers hostel someone mentioned really got me in the travel spirit. I think Kenya is just a place to keep your wits about you (as with any traveling) and you'll have a great time. Sending you solo travel courage, friend!",

I always had the feeling that I really didn\u2019t enjoyed the time when I met other traveler and done some day trips with them. \n\nI always had the feeling like, that I first need to get known them. It\u2019s not like travel with friends or family, who you really know and can enjoy things. It\u2019s more that I first need to overcome the \u201cget known\u201d stage, so we can also just hanging around without constantly talking. But mostly there isn\u2019t enough time for that and it\u2019s always this weird and exhausting getting known better stage. \n\nIt\u2019s not that fun, than with friends and family travel.\n\nBecause of that, I was more to tend to go in hotels, so i don\u2019t need to deal this things. But every time I move to the next city I always think \u201cshould I try a hostel again or stay in a hotel\u201d\n\nIn fact I want to meet people and have fun. But the people I met, it was never really that fun. Maybe it\u2019s because of me and my mindset. \n\nCan somebody relate or giving tips?",

If you haven't been enjoying hostels and socializing with new people you don't have to travel that way. I usually stay in hotels and meeting people isn't really the goal on my trips, I just do stuff on my own when traveling alone.",

I meet people on day tours, but I am always happy to get back to my hotel, swim, and maybe have a drink at the bar. I can be social, but I'm not on my trip to hunt for friends. I don't even do that at home. I can deal with them during a day excursion, but otherwise, I don't care if they are there , or not. \n\nI went to a hostel party once (after an excursion in Cambodia), but after one beer, I jumped happily into a tuktuk and went back to my hotel. Not my world : loud and just not my crowd.  might be something for you, idk. But I would rather have a nice hotel and my pool. Everybody has different ideas about travel comfort!",

It's different to travelling as a group as you really need to put a lot of energy into it to get the most out of it, if you're not going to plan the trip or put yourself out there then no one is going to do it for you. You also need to be happy with taking some down time when you need it and not have constant FOMO if you're out late partying and so can't go surfing in them morning with some other people. Solo travel requires you to be confident and take full ownership of your actions.",

            "comment": "I travel solo precisely to keep some distance between myself and other travellers. If and when I do feel a little too quiet, I prefer finding activities and tours that help me interact with locals instead of other tourists. A good hack is finding the nearest nice bookshop and asking the visitors there for recommendations on things to read or places to visit. There's a lot more to learn that way, and sometimes the communication gap helps keep the conversation light. \n\nPersonally, I find hostels to be backpacker ghettoes of sorts - you end up meeting the same cookie-cutter traveller and going on the same budget-friendly tours and activities. Hotels force you to do a bit of your own travel arranging, and sometimes getting a private guide or activity, while more expensive, is much more intensive when it comes to understanding a destination.",

            "comment": "It's different for everyone. I did my first backpacking-style solo trip two months ago, and one of the highlights of my trip was hanging out with fellow solo travelers that I met in the hostels that I stayed in. I don't go in with the mindset of expecting to make permanent friends or to find the love of my life while traveling, like you might see in movies. I just expect to have some cool adventures with interesting people from other countries that I never would have otherwise met, then we go our separate ways and (probably) never see each other again. But I enjoyed making temporary travel friends with travelers from all around the world for a bit just because it reminds me of what a huge place the world is.\n\n&gt;In fact I want to meet people and have fun. But the people I met, it was never really that fun. Maybe it\u2019s because of me and my mindset.\n\nI'm not sure what steps you took, but personally I read reviews on Hostelworld to determine the vibes of the hostels I was staying at (To see if it's a party hostel, a social-but-not-party one, or a quiet, more laid-back one, etc.). To be honest, with my personality I think I would get bored if I was traveling solo and only interacted with hotel/restaurant employees. \n\nThat said, as much as I enjoyed staying in hostels I did find that I needed to book one night in a private hotel room just to \"recharge.\"",

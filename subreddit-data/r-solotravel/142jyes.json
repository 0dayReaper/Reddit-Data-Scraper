I'd like to do the South too at some point. The places that stood out to me from my quick sampler trip were Wellington (I liked the city options as well as being close enough to nature to take some hikes), Taupo (it reminded me of the beach towns and lakes near home), and Rotorua (I don't know why, I think this city just had a lot of personality). If you've got any recs similar to the standouts or your personal favs, I'd love to know!",

Sure, stop and look, but 1000% don't have it in your diary to go to.\n\nThey were just a circular rock on a beach - and only a quarter of it was sticking out. The largest one came up to my waist, and there was 56 people there (I counted).\n\nAm happy I didn't make plans to go there deliberately but decided might as well since I was passing. Didn't even bother trying to take a photo since it wasn't worth it.\n\nThat's my 2 cents",

I wondered if starting in Wellington might be silly, so it's nice to hear that it's not an absurd thing to do. I looked up Milford Sound over lunch and wow. Getting on the fiord is def gonna be on the list. \n\nAlso, I was low-key excited to see Fox Glacier as a recommendation. I heard about it because I like foxes (I know it's named after a person and not the animal, but a girl can dream), but I didn't know if it was a place worth going.\n\nI think someone on my last trip had said if I've seen Auckland, then there's not much point in hitting up Christchurch. I'd only considered it because it's got an airport, but I don't think it's the only place in your recommendations that's got one. So maybe enter from Wellington and head home from Queenstown...\n\nThanks again for your help!",

By the time we got into the city it was evening so we didn't do anything other than grab a quick bite, and we intentionally scheduled \"light\" activities for the following day where we didn't have to wake up super early. But really didn't have any jet lag or adjustment time, we all felt fine. We didn't feel like we \"wasted\" any days adjusting. But you lose a day because of the time difference (19 hours ahead of Vancouver for us). \n\nComing back to Vancouver was little rougher. We flew back from Fiji on Friday night and arrived in Vancouver Friday afternoon . It took me a good several days to not feel completely exhausted. The first week back at work was pretty rough lol.",

I am from NZ and in the US at the moment and got no jet lag coming here because I timed my flights nicely. \n\nTry to arrive at your destination around midday. Turning up first thing in the morning sucks because you have to wait ages until check in time and you have to power through the whole day tired to not muck your sleep schedule up. But if you turn up late at night sometimes you\u2019re not tired yet and you stay awake too late and muck your schedule up.\n\nTurning up at midday means you can check in and then by the time you\u2019ve gotten settled and gotten something to eat it\u2019s closer to an appropriate time to sleep if you need to but you\u2019ve still got a few hours to tire yourself out if you\u2019re not sleepy yet.\n\nThere\u2019s also an app called Timeshifter that\u2019s meant to help with jet lag.

I was there for two months in 2018 and spent time in both islands (I believe most tourists spend their time on the South). Of course the pandemic may have changed things but...\n\nThings I enjoyed:\n\n- the coffee!\n\n- getting a tour of the parliament building (Beehive) in Wellington\n\n- learning about NZ history in Waitangi. As an American, I was so surprised the treaty interactions between British colonists and the Maori were so recent.\n\n- I thought the people were so friendly and trusting! It's mostly very open to solo travelers, except a few overcrowded areas (Golden Bay comes to mind). People are generally curious about where you're from and why you're there.\n\n- I met the person who became my closest friend and now we're travel buddies who meet up every year :)\n\n- Absolutely stunning scenery. I loved Northland, the top of the South, and the area around Queenstown especially. Heaven for hikers.\n\nTips:\n\n- There were not as many accomodation options as I expected around Queenstown. I knew someone who couldn't find anything affordable in Queenstown so she went back to Christchurch. Either you have to be flexible, be ready to pay, or book months ahead.\n\n- I had never driven on the left before but it wasn't hard to get used to. The only hard thing for me was crowded roundabouts (watch a few YT videos before you go).\n\n- I met quite a few people working at hostels who were doing the youth work visa. Not sure if it's back after the pandemic (and I'm too old now) but it seems like a good option if you come from an eligible country, want to stay for a year or two, and want to work to earn travel money.",

The thing to get used to is knowing where the other side of the car is. If you are used to sitting on the left side you have a feel for where the boundaries of the car are. This gets thrown off when you get behind the wheel on the right. I just hugged the lane border on my side, because if I am just inside that then clearly the other side of my car is inside of its border.\n\nAnd rather than roundabouts, my issue was exiting parking lots. I kept going to the right side of the exit instead of the left because there were fewer cues to where I was supposed to be \ud83d\ude02",

            "comment": "It\u2019s BEAUTIFUL there. I stayed just north of Wellington in a small peaceful beach town. Was there three weeks and felt there was loads to do even without a car. Lots of solo travelers there, not the \u201cgap year\u201d teenager sort of travelers but the more mature type if you know what I mean. Most travelers I met were on work visa or just finished their work visa in Australia. So interesting learning about M\u0101ori culture, especially being from the US where there\u2019s basically no recognition of the indigenous people. Everyone I met (locals and travelers) were so kind, and i definitely noticed a huge outdoorsy/adventurous spirit amongst most people.",

We did a bunch of thrill seeking activities (shot over jet, bungy jumping, gorge swinging, etc), took a day trip to Milford Sound, wine tasting, etc etc. The people are also very friendly. Can\u2019t wait to go back!",

Basically it's a service where you get a free rental vehicle in return you just have to drive it to it's destination by the date listed and under the kilometers listed. \n\nBack in 2018 I had taken a bus up to Picton from CHC and was kinda stuck, unsure where to go next. I found a transfer car to Greymouth/Westport so got to drive across a good section of the country and just enjoy the scenery and random spots along the way. Then spent a few nights on the west coast before somehow miraculously finding another transfer car back to Christchurch for my flight home. It was super fun and I stayed in hostels/slept in my vehicles so didn't have to spend a ton of money on my travel.",

I know more about touristic destinations in the south island but feel free to ask about the north island since I live there.\n\nAlso if you have *any* questions about hiking here, I'd LOVE to share my knowledge over it.\n\nI'm happy to talk about hikes, places I enjoyed, places to skip (or not have high expectations), favourite hostels etc.\n\nAlso, shout out to the best hostel in the world: Bob and Maxine Backpackers in Te Anau (the town closest to Milford Sound). Slightly more expensive than other dorm places, but I would HANDS DOWN pay the extra fee because I've never experienced such an amazing place with such amazing hosts. Definitely need to give them a shout out!",

Personally my parents made me really worried about driving in snowy conditions, so instead I got a winter seasonal job in Lake Tekapo.\n\nWe have amazing mountains with snow but due to the snowfall, roads do get closed more often. NZ is amazing all year round, but I wouldn't go there just for winter (I am biased because I love warmer weather :P)",

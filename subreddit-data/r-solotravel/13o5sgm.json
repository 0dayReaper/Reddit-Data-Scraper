    "postText": "I was supposed to be staying at a hostel in Milan in a trip I\u2019d be doing in a couple of weeks. However, as dumb as I am, I didn\u2019t take the time to read reviews until now and I was negatively surprised. I chose this hostel because it was the cheapest by far (23\u20ac x 2 nights) but I\u2019ve never read as negative reviews as this ones. From dirtiness to being stolen in the bedrooms, scammed by the hosts and them being hostile/racist\u2026 customers repeated over and over not to stay here \n\n\nI\u2019ve decided to book another hostel that even though it\u2019s the next cheapest option, it\u2019s much more expensive (57\u20ac x 2 nights) I\u2019m feeling dumb and angry with myself for not checking something as basic as reviews before booking, specially when there is a no-refund clause.\n\nBut this is my first solo travel and I\u2019m not willing to risk having such a negative experience on the first two nights. Guess I\u2019ll try to cut those 20\u20ac out from somewhere in the budget\u2026 At least I learned a lesson for next time.\n\nDo you think I did the appropriate thing or that I should have risked it and went to the original hostel?",

Sounds like you probably made the right call - maybe if you'd stayed there you would've been fine, but 40\u20ac or so is a relatively small price to pay not to have to worry about it and to start your trip off on the right foot.",

So don't worry about taking a call on booking another hostel, you did the right thing!",

Right now I'm in Taipei finishing up a 2 month trip in Taiwan and Japan and I booked a hostel bed for my last 2 nights in Taiwan. The hostel is fine, but once I got there I realized I really don't feel like staying in a dorm anymore, so I booked a $36 hotel room for my last night in the country. My hostel booking is already paid for ($22 for 2 nights), so I'm out $11 for my last day, but I'm not worried about the money. \n\nSometimes it's worth it to trust your gut and take the money hit for better accommodation.",

I'd rather lose 40Euro now than your 600$ phone, all your cash tomorrow and/or catch bedbugs..\n\nI usually check average rating and make sure to look specifically at the latest reviews too. \nIf the hotel has a rating of 8.2 but all the recent reviews are 5 and less you know ownership/priority have changed (narrowly escaped sleeping in a hotel that went from nightly to hourly rates thanks to that. Lol). \n\nThey'll also tell you about temporary drawbacks such as construction work, broken elevators, etc.\n\nYou've also not lost that much coin.. Skip one movie you wanted to see in the cinemas and you'll have caught up on the extra expense. I'd personally not cut it out of this trips budget (just because it would feel like I'm punishing myself by missing out on things I'd like to do) but would catch up back home by eating some more pasta with garlic &amp; oil instead of fancy veggie/meat dishes.",

Also, I got things stolen from me 3 times in 3 different hostels and these were hostels with amazing reviews. Hostel never takes responsibility for things that are stolen inside the rooms, there are no CCTV cameras inside the rooms so it\u2019s very hard to prove anything anyway. Which is why you never leave your valuables outside of your locker even in a hostel with 9/10 reviews rate.",

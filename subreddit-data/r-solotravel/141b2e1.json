I will say, I've met Germans in every single place I've traveled to, even in the middle of nowhere.

I met or heard Germans in every single city or village.",

This is largely the case with Germans in Europe, Greece Mykonos etc.. It's warm, it's comfortable, it's cheaper, the food is decent and it's frequented by enough of similar people that it has a certain expat comfort about it. UK has the same frequented places as well as people from the US. It's all about comfort, convenience etc\n\nThen there are others who really want to explore, new culture new things but some people just want to go to Florida you know palm trees, sand beaches drinks.\n\nOf course, to each their own.",

In mexico everyone is  my skin color and the food, neighborhood designs, landscape, plants and language is nearly identical to what my neighborhood in California looks and sounds like. Mexico deserts are almost indistinguishable from West Coast and Midwest US landscape. Mexico is close. It\u2019s familiar. Most Americans if not all have met a mexican person. Or works with and has them in their communities. British people are a bit rarer to come across in smaller places.

Western Europe, the Balkans, the Stans, the Middle East, West Africa, East Africa, Central America, The Caribbean, etc. I do expect some sort of quantity, but it must be coupled with quality. \n\nI don\u2019t think I could ever refer to myself as well-traveled. It sounds awfully arrogant to say of oneself ha. There\u2019s also someone more well-traveled than you are. You\u2019ve never been to Togo? Guyana? Nepal? Oh, I thought you were well-traveled?!?! \n\nI agree with the person who said the more places I go, the more I realize I\u2019m how not well-traveled I am. \n\nMaybe I prefer the term \u201cexperienced\u201d traveler or perhaps experienced in an a certain area of the globe. If you go to all 7 countries in Central America and spend 1-2 weeks in each country, then yes, you can claim some experience with understanding travel in the region. You have some insight into the culture, the food, the people, way of life, etc. \n\nI too want quantity in my travels, but I won\u2019t sacrifice quality to get there.

Going to 20 different countries in Europe, while amazing, surely doesn\u2019t make you well traveled. Variety is key to me. Dabble in some Africa, spend some time in Asia, explore a little South America. \n\nBeing well traveled person means that you\u2019ve experienced a lot of what this world has to offer.",

Anyone who claims to have seen everything out there is quite frankly full of doo doo. \nI suggest reading Jeff Greenwald's book \"The size of the World\".  He travelled around the world without taking a single plane flight so he experienced everything in between destinations that one would normally miss otherwise. Great book and journey. \n\nThat being said, to me, to be truly well travelled, it's not enough to only  visit the other countries, anyone can do that  but also to absorb, learn and appreciate the different cultures along the way, that takes several lifetimes. \ud83d\ude09",

I'm at 24 countries since 9/21 and while I'm the most experienced traveler of anyone I know back home, I've met people who have been on the road for 8-10 years and have been to far more countries. \n\nI think it's important to remember it isn't a competition though. You can sprint around the world collecting countries, but it's just a number and not reflective of your experience. Spending ~7 weeks in Guatemala was only 1 country, riding trains from the Netherlands to Italy took me less time than that and hit 4 countries. That doesn't mean Guatemala was a less valuable experience. \n\nSimilarly, the Vatican is *technically* a country, while Puerto Rico - which feels like a sovereign country - is a U.S. territory. Between the two of them I count it as one \"country\" because I kind of feel the Vatican is a BS one to count.",

Does anyone have any advice, is there any worthwhile day trips or other cities to consider. I will be travelling by train and will be staying in hostels. My budget is $6,000 EUR.  \nAmsterdam (5 nights) 18-22 Jul  \nBerlin (5 nights) 23-27 Jul  \nPrague (4 nights) 28-31 Jul  \nVienna (4 nights) 1-4 Aug  \nBudapest (3 nights) 5-7 Aug  \nEverything is flexible except for Amsterdam. Is this doable or is it rushed towards the end?",

There are affordable shuttle services between CK and Salzburg.\n\nFor something even more ambitious - [here is a southerly route with Bruges, Paris, The Alsace and Munich](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=amsterdam$3$r~bruges$1~paris$3~colmar$1~munich$2~berlin$3~dresden$0$e~prague$3$r~vienna$2$r~bratislava$0$e~budapest$3$r&amp;trans=Train&amp;nights=21&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;). This one actually is a bit rushed, but it avoids the 6.5 hour Amsterdam-&gt;Berlin leg and gives you an idea of what is possible using the most efficient bits of the EU rail network.",

You might like the rest of the cities in your itinerary so much that you will end up staying more time there. Just don't expect much old town vibes beauty from Berlin as it is dirty but it has some of the world's best techno night clubs.\n\nIf you need more advise on Berlin/Prague/Budapest night clubs here are my recommendations: \n\n[https://shawshank.co.in/blogs/travel/berlins-best-techno-night-clubs](https://shawshank.co.in/blogs/travel/berlins-best-techno-night-clubs)",

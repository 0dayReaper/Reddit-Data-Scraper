    "postText": "I'm \\~23 years old from the US stopping in Bhubaneswar, India for 6 days and 6nights in early July. I'm interested in nature but have never been to India before. I don't speak the language, but it seems most people speak English well so I hope we can navigate with working English/Google Translate and basic expressions. I don't see a lot of travel advice from foreigners so I'm unsure how to navigate this trip, I can see we can do things like Lingaraj Temple, take a couple days to the beachside of Puri, go to Konarck, explore mangroves/forests, etc. but I'm unsure if its a good time to go given it is monsoon season. Would it be better to just travel futher north to the Himalayas to avoid any bad weather, or will staying in Odisha be fine? I have traveled to places in SEasia before, but never South Asia. Any help or direction pointing to what I should expect/how I can enjoy my time would be greatly appreciated!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "Early July might mean you could ride out before the monsoon starts.(it's hit or miss). But I can surely say it won't be incessant, unless your luck is fucked.\n\nYou got the main spots right. Bhubhaneshwar(BBSR), Konark and Puri should easily cover the 6 days comfortably. \n\nThere are udayagiri khandagiri caves near BBSR. Which would take a day.\n\nIf it's monsoon there would be a lot of waterfalls in national parks which would be active.\n\nIf you like birds and dolphins there is chilika lake. Which would be a day trip from BBSR.\n\nIf you like tigers and gharials and all there is Satkosia national park and mahanandi river.\n\nI would say 6 days could go by easily in and around east Orissa and unless you want to go to the mountains(Himalayas) there is plenty to do around.\n\n\nOrissa is also a relatively poor state, so your money stretches more.",

People always say \"just go anyways\" but I can't get over the mental hurdle since clubbing alone in the USA is seen as super weird.\n\nJust looking for some people to have fun! Open to doing tons of other things in Berlin as well during the day.\n\nI have the appropriate attire for these places (I think) and have thoroughly researched how to act to get in (especially Berghain).",

I would imagine party hostels are quite easy to find given the massive club scene.\n\nI've heard pub crawls are a good way to do this if you're solo. They're often also full of tourists (and a few locals, at least local to Czech Republic). \n\nPrague is a super common spot for bachelor/bachelorette parties, so you'll often find groups of people who speak English well. \n\nAgain, it is unbelievably cheap. You can usually get a full size beer for &lt;1 USD and a cocktail for about 3-4 USD. I once got a glass of 17 year single cask scotch for 7 USD.",

For instance, are you moving out of an apartment, and will you need to store all your stuff somewhere? If so you'll need to figure out what to do with your things. If you have a stable home you'll be coming home to after the trip there's not much to worry about, although depending on the time of year of your trip, don't forget about any important deadlines (for instance if you're traveling from the US and you'll be abroad during tax season, you might want to file for an extension or plan ahead for filing taxes overseas).\n\nFor basic planning and packing trips see our Wiki articles on \"trip planning\" and \"packing 101.\" \n\nFor things to bring with you: a lot of stuff can be handled overseas if you forget it, but some essentials obviously are passport and any visa requirements (offhand I believe Vietnam and India require tourist visas to enter, so you'll need to look up and apply for those, and check about visa requirements for other countries as well), plus first aid and medical stuff (I suggest finding a local \"travel clinic\" to consult about any needed vaccinations - if this is your first time traveling to lower-income countries you'll probably be advised to get some vaccinations like the typhoid shot). They'll also be able to recommend some medications you can bring in case of foodborn illness (though if anything lasts much longer than a couple days, going to a clinic may be a good idea to make sure you're getting rehydrated properly)\n\nOtherwise from my experience with longterm traveling it helps to pack, beyond the obvious things, a portable phone charger, a Kindle so you can read books without needing to pack tons of them, a scanned copy of your passport, as bare minimum things.\n\nFor a longterm trip it's important to take time to rest along the way, so that's just something to keep in mind.\n\nEdit - also for safety and avoiding scams/annoyances, definitely do some research on precautions to take in each destination you plan on visiting, as well as \"common scams in X country.\" In some places scams may be a frequent-ish thing to worry about while in others they'll likely be extremely rare or totally nonexistent, but better to be prepared.",

I've grown sick of working for my current IT gig\n\nIf it makes you feel better, there's a chance you'll find like-minded people.\n\nA fun memory I have is I was staying at Yes Inn hostel in Hong Kong years ago. Half the travelers in my dorm room worked in IT and the other half were university students majoring in IT. A few years later, I enrolled in a web design program, so I joke that their techiness rubbed off on me. I've met a fair number of IT people in my travels. \n\nYou're young, so I think you could bounce back into the job market after a stint of solo travel. Later on when you're married, have kids, have a mortgage, etc. that will make it harder. \n\n&gt;Should I get a proper \"route\" planned before quitting or do a test run and just use annual leave (work holidays)?\n\nI was going to suggest starting with shorter trips if you haven't done so yet, but it looks like you have. \n\nYou should plan, but you should also be open and flexible to your plans changing. Maybe you like a place more than you thought and stay longer, you stumble into a cool job, you fall in love, etc. \n\nSometimes it's better to keep plans secret. Maybe you get to a place and don't like it. If you keep your plans secret, you don't have to worry about getting embarrassed if your plans change. It's easier to add to your announcements, rather than take them back. \n\n&gt;I want to go to Europe but apart from wanting to see music \n\nAny aspect of travel that gets you excited is worth focusing on. Belgrade, Serbia is supposed to be a great party city in the summer, when nightclubs host parties along the river. Yacht Week in Croatia is a great time too, I've heard.\n\nHope this helps.",

When I was younger, I told everyone I was going to teach English in Japan with the JET program. I got rejected, that was so embarrassing. \n\nI ended up going to China instead, then later Taiwan. While China wasn't my cup of tea, I loved Taiwan. So I wouldn't change what happened. \n\n&gt;I've never stayed in a hostel but I feel like I can picture it and understand why that's such a good memory for you, sounds like that small moment changed your life in a really good way.\n\nIf you've never stayed in a hostel before, I'd really recommend starting with a small-ish dorm room, like 4 to 6 people. I jumped into the deep end with a 10-person dorm at my very first hostel, a St. Christopher's Inn branch in London. \n\nWhen the lights turned off and the room plunged into darkness, the reality of ***sleeping in a room with 9 strangers*** hit me like a brick. \"Will I get murdered in my sleep?!\" Luckily, I woke up the next day not murdered.\n\nLearn from my mistake, ha ha ha. I told this story to another backpacker. He totally agreed and said his first time in a hostel he stayed in a 20-person dorm room. I can't even imagine how scary that would have been as a rookie traveler.\n\nNowadays, my biggest fear from a large dorm room is that there's a higher probability of someone who snores, lol. Bring ear plugs.\n\nFor me, I've found 4 to 8 people is the sweet spot for socializing and comfort. Once you get to 10 people and higher, I think the loss of privacy makes people retreat into their shells more. That's been my experience. \n\nAnother tip. Don't be afraid to ask to change rooms if it feels off to you. In my 10+ years of travel, I've only had to do it once. Mainly because I go with the highest-rated hostels, not chase the cheapest hostels. So it's rare I walk into a bad hostel.\n\nI once walked into a tiny, cramped, dark 6-person dorm room with rickety bunk beds at Firehouse Hostel in Austin, Texas. So tiny that if you tripped, you'd fall onto someone else's bed--or onto someone lying in bed. My immediate reaction was, \"No way.\" \n\nSo I went back to the front desk and asked to be changed to another room. The clerk reassigned me to a large, comfortable 8-bed dorm room with tons of bright natural light instead. The bunk beds were my favorite kind, solid wooden frames with little stairways between the beds to get to the top bunks instead of fragile, noisy ladders. \n\nEven better, I met two friendly Australian backpackers who became my best friends while in Austin. Completely transformed my trip. I was so so thankful I asserted myself, which can be hard sometimes. I would have been miserable if I'd accepted that first room.\n\nSo sometimes the quality of the rooms can very drastically, even within the same hostel. \n\nI should wrap this up, I get long-winded when I talk about topics like travel. \n\nShared a few more things here:\n\n[\\[Serious\\] Travelers, what are some \"tourism/travel hacks\" newbies should know?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4qbnqn/serious_travelers_what_are_some_tourismtravel/d4rw9iq/) - The sub-comments under my comment have more good tips.",

If your flights are all booked through the same airline they can also help you if your first flight is delayed.\n\nAs for getting to the airport, pre-booking a cab might make sense. Depending on your budget, some airports also have hotels that are basically attached to the airport, so you potentially stay the night in a place like that and then wake up early for the flight.",

If you wanted to stick to overland travel, you could put together a nice itinerary through a bunch of Northeast USA &amp; Canada, mostly using buses. When I was traveling the states years ago, Megabus was really good, and there was also Greyhound which was fine. In that corner of the world, I've been to Montreal, Toronto, Boston, New York, Philadelphia and DC all of which are interesting enough. There's probably a lot more to see than I did and you could easily make a see-almost-everything Northeast itinerary for that time.\n\nPlane travel is also not bad, and if you're more interested in, say, Chicago or Texas or California or Florida or New Orleans etc etc, there's no reason you couldn't chuck in a mini-trip in there too using flights. I found that if you're not driving, in North America you're pretty much stuck to visiting the cities.  There are some incredible national parks in NA but you might struggle without driving to get anywhere.",

You have to get the key from a cafe that's approx. 800 meters from the apartment.\n\nNot usually bad since I'm a fit guy, but I'll be arriving at night + with a laptop + wheeled luggage and there's a chance it might rain. I can take a taxi, but I'd rather not. (I also talked to the owner re: firm mattress and she said she fixed it)\n\nThe next two are near each other in Batignolles and are maybe 10%-15% cheaper, but seem to offer just as good if not better amenities because they're not as central as the first one.\n\nThis [one](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/829477575925096624?guests=1&amp;adults=1&amp;s=67&amp;unique_share_id=a9965779-b08a-4d64-a71a-9d577cde2953) has a washer and looks to have bigger space and a better bed. It also allows late check-in because it uses a lockbox. This [one](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/845737265258588920?guests=1&amp;adults=1&amp;s=67&amp;unique_share_id=f8a50bbf-4d75-4cd6-bd7d-3b271a8c09e4) seems to be the most thoughtful in terms of amenities. Check-in is also a little later until 11 PM.\n\nThank you for your thoughts!\n\nPS: They all don't have ACs, but since it's in October, I likely shouldn't need them but I'm ready to hear your opinions.",

There are currently three different posts about scams on the front page right now, it's a little concerning.\n\nHere's some advice on how to combat them :\n\n-Before your trip, Google \"common tourist scams in\" country\". This will give you a general idea of what to expect and be on the lookout for. Check YouTube as well. For example, this channel: https://www.youtube.com/@HONESTGUIDE\n\n-If someone approaches you randomly on the street, 99% of the time it's a scam or they're Tring to sell you something. Just shake your head or don't answer and they will leave you alone\n\n-check what the local currency looks like before you leave. Be on the lookout for fake or similar looking bills. Eg: http://scamglobalalert.com/egypt-50-pound-note-trick-scam/\n\n-If you match with a local on Tinder, make sure to meet for a drink at a location of YOUR CHOOSING first. Always check the price of things before you order\n\nStay safe out there",

            "comment": "Hello Everyone\r  \n\r  \nI recently booked a Europe trip from August 14th - September 14th, I was hoping I would have some friends join along the way but they are no longer able to make it so I will be doing the whole trip on my own which I am a bit nervous about. I will be flying in and out of Rome so looking at places to explore around here (Italy, Greece, Croatia, Malta, Bosnia?, Albania?). I have already explored some of the western/northern side of Europe (England, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Netherlands etc.) so I am looking to stick to Southern Europe.\r  \n\r  \nBest countries/cities for solo travellers?\r  \n\r  \nDoes anyone have any recommendations for travelling to these countries? Are any countries or cities that are a must or any places that I should avoid? I solo travelled Amsterdam last year and although it was really fun I was harassed while walking alone one night and it scared me off of solo travelling for a while. I enjoy site seeing and exploring the ocean/nature but also love to party so looking for places with a mix of this that I would have fun in as a 26-year-old woman going through a quarter-life crisis hehe. As well, when I thought I had a friend joining me I was looking at going to the Amalfi Coast in Italy, however, I feel that this may be a bit of a lonely place to go alone as it seems to be more of a honeymoon, couple destination and not for a young solo traveller?\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAlso, does anyone have any experience going to Berlin alone and navigating the rave scene? Probably won't go here as it is out of the way but it has always been on my bucket list!\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n**Hostel Recommendations for Solo Travellers?**\r  \n\r  \nMy second question is about recommendations for hostels. I am looking for hostels where it is easy to make friends and there are activities which the hostel offers.\r  \n\r  \nFor example, I had a great experience in Lisbon at Yes! Lisbon. They had a great common area where it was easy to meet other people, nightly pub crawls and paid excursions opportunities that you could go on to see outside of Lisbon which were affordable and a fun way to tours with other young people.\r  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, I had a not as great experience in Amsterdam at The Winston which was highly rated on Hostelworld. There wasnt a common area to meet other travellers and instead, there was only a bar that was open to the public. The hostel itself didn\u2019t put on events and I felt like I was staying at a hotel rather than a hostel. \r  \n\r  \nIf you have any great experiences with hostels like Yes! Lisbon in Western European countries or hostels to avoid I would love to hear your recommendations.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*\\*Also if anyone else is going solo travelling during this time and would like to link up please let me know! I love making new friends and connections. Thanks for all the advice, everyone.",

I was by myself and I thought, screw it, if it doesn't work out then I'll just make a new plan on the fly. I followed all the unofficial rules of how to get in (easy to find with a Google search) and got in and I had a great time. Actually they say it is most effective to go alone so I would say go for it. Of course there's tons of clubs there and I am sure more experienced people can give you more recommendations. But if you don't make it to Berlin then I think you would have fun in any of the places you listed. My friend went to Corfu last year and loved it. Bosnia might be my favorite country I have ever visited but I don't really have mainstream travel taste so YMMV. It is really beautiful and not flooded with tourists.",

Of course, there are always the luxury options, but I haven't tried those.\n\nWhat I suggest is you eat where your fellow tourists eat because food poisoning (mostly from the water) is a thing in that part of the world. Better to buy bottled water than drink from the tap even if it's $1 per bottle, unless the hotel or your stay has a means of filtering.",

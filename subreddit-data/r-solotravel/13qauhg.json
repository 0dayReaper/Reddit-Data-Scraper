    "postText": "Hi, would be grateful for suggestions on some travel destinations from May-Aug 2024 (will probably be travelling for 2-3 months only because of budget). \n\nI have a few routes in mind: \n1) Colombia &gt; Ecuador &gt; Peru (or maybe just 2 of them) \n2) India &gt; Nepal &gt; China \n3) Greece &gt; Western Europe \n4) Greece &gt; Balkan countries \n\nI know these destinations are wildly different lol, but here are my considerations: \n\n1. Budget: About $10k USD (probably able to stretch to $12k) INCLUSIVE of flights. And I\u2019ll be flying from Singapore, which makes the South American route the least feasible because the return flights alone will probably cost me about $3000 lol. (If anyone has any suggestions on cheap ways to fly from SEA to SA, aside from the usual Skyscanner, please share!) Tickets to India and Athens (surprisingly) are really cheap, so I\u2019ll be able to have a bigger budget for travelling.\n\n2. What I\u2019m looking for: The usual- food and culture. But I\u2019m also really into hiking and mountains, so that would be great! Honestly, this would be my last big backpacking trip before starting work (where I\u2019ll probably only have like 2 weeks of vacation a year) so anything that\u2019s more adventurous/different/would not be possible as a week long trip lol would be best (hence South America is kinda pretty high up in my list). I\u2019ve been to most parts of Asia (Central, east, SEA) and some parts of Europe, so would skip those if possible. Idm partying, but it\u2019s not really something that I\u2019m really looking for. \n\n3. Other considerations: I wouldn\u2019t consider myself super well-travelled- the most \u2018dangerous\u2019 places I\u2019ve been to were probably SEA and the Stans, but because I\u2019m Asian I blend in pretty well, and they\u2019re not really unsafe in my opinion. But I feel like I\u2019ll really stick out in South America as an Asian female, so if anyone has any experiences regarding that I would really like to hear it! I would very much prefer to travel by myself, but I\u2019ll definitely use G adventures or smth similar in India, and maybe that too in South America? But at this point, I\u2019d prefer to just research and learn some Spanish (since I still have an entire year) if I were to go. \n\nAny suggestions would be great, thank you!",

            "comment": "Fellow Singaporean here!!!\n\nI would personally choose the Colombia, Ecuador Peru route if I were you. To put it simply, it isn't going to be possible to travel there when you are working, because it takes quite a long time to get there. \n\nYou could easily fit an India trip within 2 weeks, a Nepal trip within 2 weeks and a China trip within 2 weeks, since there are plenty of flights from Singapore. It is also feasible to travel to Europe for a 2 week trip as long as you stick to 1 or 2 countries at a time. So when you start working, you will have some opportunity to visit some of the places in itinerary 2, 3 and 4. \n\nYou will not get to visit South America whilst working, unless you quit your job and go travel for an extended period (I'm planning to do that some day). All other destinations listed are within reach for a 2 week trip. So if I were you, I'd take the plunge and go to South America.",

I started and ended up in Bangkok and it cost around 1600 USD return. The trick is to fly to Los Angeles first and then get separate flights from LA to hubs like Lima or Bogota - for some reason Bangkok to LA is cheaper than other connections.",

Btw, one thing to keep an eye out for is the weather in South America, as it has very big contrasts across regions - tho May to Aug will have good weather largely everywhere I think (dry winter-ish), and that makes it very touristy time as well. I was there Mar till early May this year and it was fantastic, or maybe I was lucky.",

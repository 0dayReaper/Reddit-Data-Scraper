Is this still accurate?\n\nI fed it data from all sorts of websites and had it give an estimate. The actual total is 4648 Eur (idk how it came up with that grand total), but this was assuming I purchase the most touristy stuff like tickets to museums or Disneyland, and rent hotels over private rooms. The per night was 160 Eur or in USD, \\~$173.\n\nI later asked it to re-evaluate based on my preferences, which was mostly doing cheap/free stuff like just sightseeing or entering free-to-enter places and tours. I also only eat once a day, maybe twice if I'm really hungry, and I'm good with supermarket/convenience store food. If I do eat at restos, I don't splurge (like I don't try Wagyu or anything in \"starred\" restos), but more about where the locals eat regularly.\n\n**It then said I could save at least 25%**, bringing my per-night to $129.75. I didn't bother telling it to recompute for $80 rooms, since I assumed it computed assuming I stayed in those $200 ones (the data I fed it were mostly from popular blogs). Maybe I should ask it to re-evaluate based on my preferred hotel range next time.\n\nNow that we're talking about it, I forgot to account for possible gym entries at least once a week and weekly laundry services.  \n\n\nEdit: I asked it just now to do a re-evaluation and to only use 2022-2023 data for cost of living (and it came out [cheaper](https://imgur.com/0EvpUTI)?)\n\nMy new per day in EUR would come out to 92.1 or about $100, which doesn't include souvenirs. If I add it up to $120 per day (assuming I become somewhat impulsive with some souvenirs/food), the grand total is $3600, which I'm still okay with.",

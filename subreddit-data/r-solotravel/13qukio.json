    "postText": "Hi all, I am considering going to Vietnam while I wait for some research permits to come through in Indonesia (I\u2019m a biologist!) in June. \n\nI have between June 17-25 (not a lot of time!). I really just want to relax and see a decent amount of things while not traveling too fast. I plan on coming back to Vietnam as I know I can\u2019t even come close to seeing the whole country in 8 days. \n\nI have 2 itineraries in mind, North and South:\n\nNorth:\nDay 1 (6/18): Arrive in Hanoi in the morning. spend day exploring Hanoi and getting over jetlag\n\nDay 2 (6/19): More time exploring Hanoi\n\nDay 3 (6/20): Head to Ha Long Bay. Most of the advice here says to skip HLB and head to Cat Ba. Is this good advice? I do want some relaxing time on a nice, clean beach. \n\nDay 4 (6/21): Cat Ba\n\nDay 5 (6/22): Head to Sapa\n\nDay 6 (6/23): Sapa trekking, wildlife etc\n\nDay 7 (6/24): Sapa, return to Hanoi in the evening\n\nDay 8 (6/25): fly to Jakarta\n\nNot sure if i should add/remove a day from cat ba/sapa. I dont intend on rigidly sticking to plans but I do need to be back in Hanoi to fly on the 25th! \n\n\nSouth\nDay 1 (6/18): Arrive in Ho Chi Minh in the morning. explore HCM and recover from jetlag \n\nDay 2 (6/19): HCM, maybe see the tunnels \n\nDay 3 (6/20): head to mekong delta region. I\u2019m not sure where exactly to go, but I do want to see some floating markets and wildlife\n\nDay 4 (6/21): mekong delta exploring\n\nDay 5 (6/22): get to Phu Quoc. I think this is quite far, but I\u2019ve heard Phu Quoc is gorgeous and has CLEAN beaches(!!!) important for me as I know SEA has a lot of plastic (and also have realistic expectations for this, I\u2019ve been to thai/indo beaches)\n\nDay 6 (6/23): Phu Quoc\n\nDay 7 (6/24): Phu Quoc\n\nDay 8 (6/25): fly to Jakarta! there are decent flights from the island thru KL so this is fine by me\n\nI am really torn on what to do. I think both options seem great but its so hard to choose where to spend such a short time in a place like vietnam. My main priorities are wildlife, nice clean ocean swimming, and good food. I also dont want to spend my whole trip on a bus and would rather not fly internally.",

            "comment": "It really depends on what you like, but having just got back from a Vietnam trip (18 days in country), the TLDR: I definitely vote for North!\n\nHCMC is fun for a few days, especially if you're into clubbing and fine dining, but tunnels and the Mekong Delta wouldn't be my priority on an 8 day trip. \n\nYou need 3 days in Hanoi to do it any justice, but some stuff can be cut and you'd get a good feel in 2. Ideally try to spend 3 nights so you can at least go out and sample more food. \n\nSaPa was the most beautiful part of all Vietnam IMO. June should be a good month for the rice fields, and they are amazing. I need to choose which pictures to blow up and put on my walls. I spent 2 nights and 48 hours. Is that enough? Yes... \\*IF\\* you plan it out perfectly AND the weather cooperates. I waited till weather cleared up, changed things around to make it happen, and then hastily called all the hotels and rearranged everything. In that time, I managed to visit Cat Cat Village (very touristy, but pretty), Ham Rong Mountain above SaPa (worth your hour-and-a half), do a 12-Km guided trek through the terraces (out of this world!), rent a motorbike and see the mountain pass and some outlying villages, and go to the top of Fansipan (the cable car ride over the terraces alone is worth it). Including travel to and from Hanoi... allow 3 FULL days. \n\nCruise on Ha Long Bay is worth it even if it's 1 day, but I'd do 2 days/1 night. Yes, it can be polluted, but it's very beautiful. \n\nThere's your 8 days.\n\nAlternatively, skip Ha Long Bay and go to Ninh Binh for 2 days. They call it \"Ha Long Bay on Land\" -many of the same karst formations, but sticking out of green or yellow rice fields instead of the water. Ninh Binh is cheaper, more pristine, and Tam Coc can be a bit of a party scene in the evening.",

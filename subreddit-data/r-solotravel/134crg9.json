    "postText": "Bonjour. I\u2019m into my 3rd week solo travelling Europe and found myself in a hostel in Paris. \nI\u2019ve been enjoying the Hostel life so far meeting fun and interesting people at both my hostel stays, though I ran into a bit of a snag last night. \n\nAfter an American who I got along with really well left, two ~50 year old men joined our room, one being in the bed below mine (damn top bunks suck). \n\nI hit the hay pretty early last night around 11pm, when the two men came into the room and turned the light on and had a normal conversation for 5 mins. No biggy, it was early considering it\u2019s May 1 tomorrow. \n\nI then found myself woken up at 2am as the man returned to the room, turning all the lights on and having a loud conversation with his friend in what I presume was Russian. That lasted for what felt like 10mins before I asked him to turn the main light off and use his light next to his bed. He declined saying \u201cit\u2019s a hostel\u201d, asked me where I was from, to which I said \u201cI don\u2019t want to have a conversation, I\u2019d just like to sleep\u201d, called me a motherfucker, muttered something in his language and kept doing his thing. He turned the light off 5mins later, and loudly said to me \u201cthat ok now!?\u201d I pretended I was asleep. \n\nThe men have just been really creepy too to the girl in my room. While she was talking to another person in the room, they interjected and asked her where she\u2019s from. She just said the US and then they continued talking in Russian to each other. It was really awkward and creepy, especially when they just ignored the other two guys in the room. \n\nI told everything to the reception and got met with, \u201cwell that\u2019s the hostel life\u201d which is fair enough, though I still moved my baggage into the hostels storage as I\u2019m planned on spending tonight in a French country town.",

Two young, drunk British guys come in and turn on all of the lights and are being super obnixious.  The United Nations of guests all yelled at them but they didn't care, just kept saying \"this is Amsterdam!!!!!!!\"  I told them if they wanted to party to go downstairs (this hostel had a 24 hour \"coffee shop\" and internet cafe)\n\nI woke up at some point to one of the men STANDING OVER ME WITH A PILLOW.  I dont think he was going to murder me, but I do think he was trying to scare me.  I screamed at him and he want back to his bed.  To this day, I think about this every so often and wonder why on earth I didn't leave and report that guy.  And, you know, make sure I didn't get murdered.  Ah to be young and dumb again.",

In particular I love old Coldplay music, Sam Smith, John Mayer, and Mumford and Sons for helping me sleep a bit.\n\nThis is always a surefire way for me to get more sleep in imperfect hostel settings, in my experience :)",

If you have $1000 to spend on lodging, then it\u2019s the choice between 50 days in $20 hostels or 20 days in $50 private rooms. That\u2019s an entire month of travel you gained just by having to deal with the occasional jerk. Or if you only have 20 days to travel anyway, that gives you an extra $600 to spend on food, entertainment, etc. For a lot of travelers, that\u2019s a trade-off that makes a ton of sense. I can see why some people would rather sleep in a private room, but personally I\u2019d much rather spend the savings on a show, experience, or fancy dinners. \n\nOf course with the savings comes the assumption of the risk that you\u2019re going to have a bad night every now and then, so you can\u2019t really complain when you run into it. Be frustrated in the moment, then remember what the savings are buying you before switching rooms or hostels for the next night.",

I'm good at trying to understand cultural differences...ironically I've run into more Eastern Europeans and Middle Easterners who tend to have louder conversations. Not sure why, but then again, us Americans often get lumped in as being arrogant. It's just part of accepting differences, and trying to enjoy the experience.\n\nBut given the foul mouthing and creepy attitude, I wouldn't hesitate to bring it up to management (again). Don't downplay the bad attitude or sexual creepiness. Separately might work a little better, so they see these 2 guys as being problematic. I also wouldn't hesitate to mention that neither of you want to be awkwardly singled out, and ask that they give a white lie that it's 4 people expressing the same concerns. Easy solution you can offer is asking for a different room.\n\nYour idea to leave is probably best. I've done that before when someone started doing weird things towards me in a hostel in Spain. Made the decision that I would rather eat a few days of the prepaid cost there, and avoid any further problems. Turned out I ended up in one of the best Airbnbs I've ever stayed in! Ironically given your countryside choice, I went to a quaint little Catalonian town with farms and really friendly locals. I loved it.",

So as a responsible adult, you keep yourself out of places and situations where one is more likely to be harassed and stick to places and situations where the risk of harassment is relatively low.\n\nOne doesn't walk through bad crime-ridden neighborhoods and expects to be safe.  So you avoid them.  It's common sense.  You don't walk through anyway because \"I should NOT expect to be victimized just walking down a street!\"  Sure, that's true.  But you need to do your part too, to manage your own level of risk and not put yourself in situations where that risk is relatively high.\n\nHostels are notorious for rude guests and harassment.  Not all of them, and not most of them, but many of them.  Enough to make your relative risk of running into a bad situation higher than many of us are comfortable with.  And so those things don't happen to us.\n\nI'm simply warning you.  Stating fact.  I don't step foot into a hostel.  Yet you think I'm part of the problem?  Not  those in the hostels who are harassing you?  Something might not be right in your head.",

The bottom two bunks were a French m/f couple, the other top bunk was a Danish guy who was sleeping throughout this whole story. The French couple were cuddling before sleep in the bottom bunk under my bunk, one of their beds was therefore empty. At about 2am, while they were still cuddling, another person came into the room. He turned on the overhead light and loudly put his stuff on the French woman's empty bunk. She said, \"Hey, that's my bunk!\" but he loudly argued her down and she eventually just decided to stay in her partner's bunk. So there were 5 people sharing a 4-person room. I was pretending to be asleep throughout, then ran out of the room early the next morning because it was so awkward.",

    "postText": "Hi Everyone,\r  \n\r  \nI (30M) am planning a **10-day trip to Turkey in June, from approximately June 14th to June 24th**. My plan is to spend 5 **days in Istanbul and 5 days exploring Eastern Turkey**. I would love some advice and recommendations for my itinerary:\r  \n\r  \n**Istanbul:**\r  \n\n\n* **June 14th:** I will arrive at IST Airport at 7 PM. Based on recommendations, I am considering staying in either Beyoglu or Karakoy. I plan to take a walk around Taksim Square in the evening. If you have any restaurant or activity recommendations for the area, please let me know!\r  \n\n* **June 15th - Historical Places:** I intend to visit Istanbul Archaeological Museums, Hagia Irene, Basilica Cistern, Milion Stone, Hagia Sophia, and Sultanahmet. I would like to enjoy a coffee while watching the sunset from a rooftop. Caf\u00e9 Seven Hills has been recommended, but I would appreciate any other suggestions. For the night, I'm thinking of going to a Jazz Club in Beyoglu. Nardis has been recommended, but I'm open to other recommendations as well.\r  \n\n* **June 16th - Modern Istanbul:** I plan to visit the Museum of Innocence (as a fan of Orhan Pamuk), Galata Tower, Pera Museum, cross the Galata Bridge, explore the New Mosque (Yeni Camii), Rustem Pasha Mosque, and visit the Egyptian Bazaar. I also want to take the ferry from Eminonu to Kadikoy and have dinner in Moda. Afterward, I'm interested in experiencing Istanbul's Metal Scene and have been recommended The Wall and Dorock in Kadikoy. If you have other recommendations, please share!\r  \n\n* **June 17th:** Panorama 1453 Museum, Kariye/Chora, Walls of Constantinople, Fener Balat, and take a ferry from Avynsaray to Eminonu (Golden Horn).\r  \n\n* **June 18th:** I plan to have breakfast in Ortakoy, visit Ortakoy Mosque, Dolmabahce Palace, and Vodafone Park (where I'll buy a BJK Jersey). Then, I'll take the tram to Galata Mevlevi Museum to see the Sema and find a rooftop to watch the sunset. Any recommendations for the evening would be appreciated.\r  \n\n* **June 19th to June 23rd -** I want to explore Eastern Turkey: Van, Dogubeyazit, Kars, and Ani. I have a few questions for this part of the trip:\r  \n\r  \nWhat is the most efficient and cost-effective way to travel between Kars and Van, or vice versa?\r  \n\r  \nConsidering the runoff election on May 28th, are there any safety concerns in these areas if Erdogan gets reelected?\r  \n\r  \nDo you have any specific recommendations for these places? I would like to experience the atmosphere described in Orhan Pamuk's book \"Snow\" in Kars and visit the ancient Armenian city of Ani. In Van, I am interested in hiking around Lake Van and visiting Dogubeyazit to see Mount Ararat. I'm also intrigued by Kurdish culture.\r  \n\r  \n**June 24th** \\- Return to Istanbul: I plan to spend the day relaxing in Istanbul before my departure the following day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, my interests lie in history, food, architecture, music, and exploring vibrant places. I am conscious of safety precautions, having grown up in a country like Colombia, but I would appreciate any location-specific advice, such as common scams in Istanbul, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, if anyone will be in any of my destinations during my trip, please let me know. I would love to meet up for a beer and connect with locals and/or fellow travelers,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers!",

            "comment": "We stayed in Beyoglu for 4 days when we arrived in Istanbul, but we ended up loving Kadikoy so much that after our road trip we booked our last few nights there. Definitely give yourself plenty of time to enjoy it. Also, be aware that the ferries going from the European side to the Asian side are not 24 hours, and taxis will not want to take you from one side to the other.",

            "comment": "Your itinerary looks like a well-rounded plan to explore Istanbul and Eastern Turkey. It's great that you are taking time to delve into both the city's history and contemporary culture. Here are some suggestions:\r  \n\r  \nIstanbul:\r  \n\r  \nJune 14th: For dinner, you can try out Nevizade Street in Beyoglu, which is famous for its traditional Turkish cuisine. It's a vibrant street with a bustling atmosphere and many different restaurants to choose from.\r  \n\r  \nJune 15th: After a long day of sightseeing, Mikla Restaurant is another great place to watch the sunset. It's located on the roof of the Marmara Pera Hotel and offers a fantastic view of the city. For jazz music, Babylon in Beyoglu is also a popular choice.\r  \n\r  \nJune 16th: For a taste of Istanbul's local cuisine in Moda, you can try Ciya Sofrasi which offers a variety of dishes from different regions of Turkey. It's located on the Asian side of the city, so it'll be convenient after your ferry ride.\r  \n\r  \nJune 17th: After your Golden Horn ferry ride, you can explore the neighborhood of Karakoy, which is a hip area with a lot of restaurants, cafes, and boutiques.\r  \n\r  \nJune 18th: In Ortakoy, you can enjoy a traditional Turkish breakfast at Kale Cafe. It offers a beautiful view of the Bosphorus. In the evening, you can visit Anjelique, a nightclub located in a three-story seaside mansion in Ortakoy.\r  \n\r  \nEastern Turkey:\r  \n\r  \nThe most efficient way to travel between Kars and Van is likely by flight. There are domestic flights operated by Turkish Airlines and other local carriers. However, if you are looking for a cheaper option, you can consider taking a bus, but it will take significantly longer.\r  \n\r  \nAs for the political situation, it's difficult to predict exactly what might happen. However, Turkey is generally a safe country to travel in, and even during election periods, it's rare for tourists to encounter significant problems. Nevertheless, it's always a good idea to stay informed about the local news and avoid large political gatherings or protests.\r  \n\r  \nIn Kars, you'll definitely want to visit the Kars Castle and the Kars Museum, which showcases the history of the region. For a taste of the atmosphere in Orhan Pamuk's \"Snow,\" you can visit the local tea houses and mingle with the locals. In the ancient Armenian city of Ani, you can explore the beautiful ruins of churches, mosques, and fortifications.\r  \n\r  \nIn Van, you can take a boat tour on Lake Van, visit the medieval Armenian church of Akdamar Island, and explore the Van Castle for a panoramic view of the city. In Dogubeyazit, the Ishak Pasha Palace is a must-see. For an immersion in Kurdish culture, you can visit the local markets and try the regional cuisine.\r  \n\r  \nIstanbul (Return):\r  \n\r  \nBe aware of common scams such as overcharging at restaurants, taxi drivers not using the meter, and street vendors selling counterfeit goods. Be sure to negotiate prices beforehand and ensure taxi drivers use the meter.\r  \n\r  \nIn terms of meeting up, you might want to check out local meetups on websites like Couchsurfing or use social media to connect with fellow travelers who will be in Turkey during your trip.\r  \n\r  \nEnjoy your trip to Turkey!",

                            "comment": "I was going to say, the whole point of the very far-east of Turkey is taking in the countryside scenery, IMO. Flying from Kars to Van skips some of the prettiest parts, honestly. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s \u201cefficient\u201d to fly. It would also be \u201cefficient\u201d to skip Ani, Akdamar, etc., lol.\n\nKars was interesting enough, but I didn\u2019t love-love-love the town itself as much as I thought I would. It has an interesting-enough Russian Empire era old town, and tea houses out the wazoo - though inflation has hit Turkey hard, even in the far-east, so throw those Lonely Planet 2019 5-dollar meal expectations out the window.\n\nAni is definitely worth taking the time to explore. Explore every corner of the site. Shocking how many beautiful viewpoints there are that people just full-on don\u2019t go to.\n\nDogubayazit is a wild little town, and I loved it. I\u2019ve seen people attribute its vibe to its \u201cKurdishness,\u201d but Van is also Kurdish and feels absolutely nothing like Dogubayazit. Van is probably the most \u201cshiny and modern\u201d (for Eastern Turkey) city in Eastern Anatolia. Dogubayazit, on the other hand, feels like a little slice of Central Asia or something. Try the barbecue. Visit the castle. And some of the best views of Ararat can be had in the super-rustic backcountry areas around its base, so if Ararat is important, maybe schedule a day tour (and include the \u201cNoah\u2019s Ark\u201d hike or something).\n\nVan, like I said, is quite modern. Visiting Akdamar will take you the better part of a day of you don\u2019t have a car, so plan accordingly. Ho\u015fap Castle is a fair distance southeast of the city, but I thought it was more beautiful than Van Castle, and the saw-tooth fortification walls running along the crags and cliffs around the village were really cool to see. Ho\u015fap was a Kurdish-ruled Armenian-majority town until the mid-1800s when\u2026 well\u2026 when the Turks became not-so-nice about that sort of thing. I *think* you can set up tours that include both Ho\u015fap and the ruins of the old Urartian capital of Cavu\u015ftepe (a more typical archaeological ruins site perched on a high hill), but I don\u2019t have any recommendations.\n\nVan also easily has the best museum in the far-east region, so if you visit only one, make it the Van Museum.\n\nAs for hiking around Lake Van, well\u2026 the shore of Lake Van is pretty heavily developed. You can drive up to the lip of the crater near Tatvan and hike a few more minutes to the summit, but it\u2019s really just the same view you\u2019d get from the crest of the road anyway. There are a couple of other interesting sites around the lake (e.g. the Seljuk graveyard, a few scattered ruins), but you\u2019re already absurdly short on time, so forget those.\n\nI *would* recommend the town of Bitlis, but it\u2019s currently undergoing a very heavy rehabilitation project and is basically one huge construction site as of early-to-mid May 2023.",

Fortunately, there are neither direct flights nor direct buses. \n\nHere's my preliminary itinerary that I constructed based on your recommendations:\n\n\\- Day 1: Arrival at Kars Airport in the morning (\\~9 AM). After a Turkish Breakfast and checking in at the hotel/hostel, I plan to take a bus or a taxi to Ani. After exploring every corner of Ani, I would return to Kars to visit Kars Castle. I am also eager to try the local cuisine and immerse myself in the atmosphere Orhan Pamuk describes in \"Snow\" by visiting the local tea houses and interacting with the locals. \r  \n\r  \n\\- Day 2: Catch the first minibus to Igdir and then proceed to Dogubayazit. Once there, I intend to visit Ishak Pasha Palace, capture some stunning pictures of Mount Ararat, and spend time getting to know the locals. \r  \n\r  \n\\- Day 3: Take the first minibus to Van. After a delightful Van Breakfast and leaving my belongings at the hotel/hostel, I plan to explore Ho\u015fap and \u00c7avu\u015ftepe Kalesi. To make the most of my time, I am considering hiring a guided tour for these two sites. Later, I would love to take a leisurely walk in the evening and savor some authentic local cuisine. \r  \n\r  \n\\- Day 4: I plan to start the day early by visiting Akdamar Island in the morning. Upon returning to Van, my next stops would be the Anthropology and Ethnography Museum, Van Fortress/Castle, and a relaxing stroll along the Van Lake, particularly Iskele Sahili. If you have any suggestions for a memorable dinner or a spot to enjoy \u00e7ay with the locals, please share them.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Day 5: I will spend my final hours in Van before taking a night flight back to Istanbul (\\~8 PM). As a cat person, I am excited to interact with some Van kitties at the Vankedi Vilasi in Y\u00fcz\u00fcnc\u00fc Y\u0131l University. Afterwards, I plan to take a final walk through Van merkez and enjoy my last lunch in the city.\n\n\r  \nOnce again, thanks a lot!",

Hell, even our hotel was scamming us on prices, but being out first night we didn't know. \n\nThe Asian side of the Bosporus is where you wanna eat, shop, stay. Everything is cheaper and better quality. Take a ride up the ferry (not the boat tour) to small stops and the prices fall further for food. \n\nI'd recommend the Prince's Islands. Ride was sweet and the island we went to was nice to walk around.  \n\nThe palace was neat, but it's expensive. Hagia Sophia is worth it. Go first thing in the morning. They let us in even before the listed opening time. \n\nHopefully the airport train is running now. That will save you $$$$$$ and maybe your life. 3rd most manic cab drivers I've experienced behind Dominican Republic and Georgia.",

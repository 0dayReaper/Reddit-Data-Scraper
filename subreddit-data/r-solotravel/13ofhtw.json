    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nI (23M) am leaving on my first solo trip tomorrow. \n\nI\u2019ll be spending 5 nights in Rome, 1 in Florence, 2 near Lecco on Lake Como, 4 nights in the Dolomites at Santa Cristina Val Gardena, and 3 nights in Vienna. Staying in AirBnBs. \n\nI\u2019m mainly going to do fun history stuff in Rome. I\u2019m definitely doing Colosseum, Forum, Palatine, Trajans Market, Via Appia Antica, Vatican, and am planning on going to Pompeii. Booked tickets already. \n\nBut aside from that I\u2019m basically going on this trip to relax, hike, meet people, etc. looking for suggestions on things to do and like bars and restaurants to eat at. As well as any tips on solo travel in general if anyone has some. \n\nThanks in advance",

            "comment": "Change Florence to Pisa, Florence is overcrowded and just super busy, Pisa has a much more relaxed vibe, cheaper and the tower is so cool, you can get to Pisa from Florence around 1 hour on train, personally I preferred Pisa. \nRome - if you don\u2019t eat pizza at \u2018piccolo Buco\u2019 then don\u2019t bother going to Rome. Joking but the pizza is the best I\u2019ve ever had in Italy.",

            "comment": "Santa Cristina is like heaven on earth, especially if you love the mountains. We were there in February skiing. We had the best dessert (apple strudel) of the trip at Pizzeria Caff\u00e8 Villa Sella. If you haven't booked a place yet, I'd highly recommend Villa Martha. It's a small B&amp;B run by one guy and it was the best hotel experience we ever had. \n\nVal Gardena has 3 main towns that are connected by bus: Ortesei, Santa Cristina and Selva. Santa Cristina is definitely the smallest. Ortesei is like the locals towns and has the most restaurants and shops. Selva has lots of stuff as well.\n\nIn terms of hiking, look into the Seceda hike. We were up there for skiing and it was absolutely gorgeous.",

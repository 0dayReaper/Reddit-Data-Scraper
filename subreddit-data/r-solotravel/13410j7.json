    "postText": "Hey guys, i am an experienced backpacker (mostly solo) in my mid\\late twenties, have traveled before in South East Asia, Europe, Central America and just recently South America. I enjoyed it very much but i felt like the \"spark\" i used to have about traveling disappeared, and i think it is because South America felt a bit too touristic for me and i got too comfortable. \n  \nTherefor i thought about going to a \"harder\" place to solo travel, Eastern/Southern Africa. I've read about it and there plenty of countries i want to visit there, enough for a 6 months trip (i also made a thread about it here a while ago).\n\nThe thing is this year i have enough time to travel for about 1~2 months. So i can't decide whether i should give a little \"test\" to Africa and go there this year to see if it gives me the spark back, or should i go a different location and save Africa for this one big trip to make it more special.\n\nPros of going to Africa now:\n\n* It might be \"too difficult\" for me to solo travel there, and its best to figure it out now and not after i start a 6 month trip there.\n* it has been on my bucket list forever\n* who knows what will happen in the future (maybe i wont be able to go, maybe ill have enough of traveling) so might as well just use the opportunity i have now\n\n\nCons of going to Africa now:\n\n* Lets say i love it there and eventually decide to go back and do a big trip there, i fear it will feel less special the 2nd time ill go there.\n* If i do go there this year it will probably be to Uganda/Tanzania, which are \"in the middle\" of East-to-South route (Ethiopia to South Africa) so it will break the streak.\n\nAll in all it obviously comes to personal preferences, but i would love to hear your opinions about what should i do, thanks!",

Each country is vastly different in culture, geography, politics, ecosystem, etc.  I've been to 23 countries in Africa, and have yet to find any of it boring or less special.",

Or am i making too big of a deal out of it?\n\nAlso i would love to hear which countries you enjoyed the most in Africa.",

I did find these to be especially memorable for differing reasons:\n\n* Namibia\n* Mauritania\n* Senegal\n* Mali\n* Benin\n* Botswana\n* Mozambique\n* Ethiopia\n* Chad\n* Sudan",

I don\u2019t see how that would diminish any future experience, especially when there\u2019s so many new an interesting places. The whole thing about not wanting to interrupt some future travel route across a whole continent as vast as Africa seems a bit silly to me. Your pros are all very valid points. Your cons feel like very minor nitpicks!",

It lasted that long because I was mostly doing volunteer work. I did get to see the main attractions in these places though. \n\nLooking back it wasn\u2019t really that hard if it\u2019s not your first time traveling alone in a developing country. Main piece of advice I could give is not to create a very tight schedule and keep things flexible/ open as much as possible. This will save you a lot of frustration. It\u2019s usually easy to get from point A to point B as long as you travel like a local. The problem is, public transport often gets very delayed, may trips get cancelled. Heck several times I\u2019ve been on buses that broke down. A lot of these aren\u2019t even comfortable. On some routes it\u2019s gonna take more than 20 hours in a so called luxury bus that isn\u2019t even remotely luxurious at all. As long as you never put yourself in any situation wherein you\u2019d have to be in a rush, you\u2019d be good. People in sub saharan Africa are generally very kind and helpful. They\u2019d be eager to help out when you ask.",

    "postText": "Please dont list any details and make it brief. \n\nI know this doesnt make sense for many people but I was really jet-lagged and walked around at 3am in Tokyo just trying to kill time. I was also drank a little to kill time so I was pretty buzzed. Many women asked me for a massage and I declined a bunch at first for obvious reasons. But then I thought again that they said they will do it for $30 for the hour. That sounded like a crazy good deal to me if they only stick with the massage so I actually thought about it.\n\nSo one more asked me if I wanted one and I asked,   \n\"I just want a massage. Is that okay?\"  \n\"Sure! you can pick your girl too\"  \n\"honestly I dont care who. I just want a good one\"  \n\"Sure come in.\"  \n\"Do you have someone who is good with feet?\"  \n\"Yes yes yes. Come in\"\n\nI honestly dont know why but I didnt think twice about anything at the time. They presented me with 3 girls and they asked me to pick. I was puzzled because I already told the lady I dont care. And the fact that the girls looked around 5'3 or so. Im a 6 foot guy who has muscle, it didnt look like they would do a satisfying job. As soon as I said, \"i dont care\", the women said, \"okay they will all work on your body\".I immediately got up and said hell no. This obviously wont be for $30 and just left.\n\nI know it's quite stupid to think a late-night massage might be okay for a massage but I at least thought some of these workers have a side hustle of knowing a bit of massage therapy so I wanted to see but nope. Seem to have only one skill that the parlor offers. Has anyone been through something similar?",

She seemed irritated. Not a good massage.\n\nSo, now I know. \n\nI always figured those places can't really offer anything elicit because it's a fixed location. Undercover vice cops have to be able to bust them so easily. How can they just operate right in the open like that. Clearly it's just a massage parlor, right?? No. It's a den of iniquity.",

You just have to find someone who knows what their doing. That may difficult because you won\u2019t know till you try. If you go to a sketchy place you will most likely get a bad massage and then wanting to provide you with something else for a extra price. Only way to guarantee a good massage is paying more at a place with actual online reviews.",

    "postText": "I booked 3 trains from Lake Garda Italy to Marseilles France. Theres about 15 minutes between each one, did I screw myself over in not allowing enough time to get off, find my next platform, etc? It was the fastest way to get from point A to B (and cheapest) so I just went with it, but if its likely I'll miss 1 or both trains I can still cancel.",

I\u2019d want to know when the next service was running (in case of delays); and from memory you can look up real time train data at some stations to see which Platform you\u2019re arriving on and which Platform you\u2019re leaving from and thus plan your quick transition.",

For example, DB (Deutsch Bahn) only allows you to take the next train if the delay is 20 minutes or more. \n\nAlso, even if you book a single ticket, you may be able to take any train on certain legs. Typically, you are free to take any local train (cannot guarantee this without details), so you may take an earlier train on your first leg.",

    "postText": "Recently broke up after a long term relationship and am exploring solo travel this year.  Equal parts of apprehension and excitement but I find myself pausing to question the following:\n\n* Am I using these trips as escapism from processing my feelings?\n* Am I proving to myself (and maybe others) I can be independent and travel alone?\n* Am I *positively* viewing this as an opportunity to visit new places and do things I really want?\n\nOr perhaps it is a mixture of everything.  For those who have been through this, I would love to hear from you!\n\nP.S.  I'm dipping my toe and have booked a weekend trip away by myself.  Using that as a barometer before I plan bigger solo holidays :)\n\nEdit:  Thank you to everyone who commented - it was lovely to hear all your experiences and has certainly  given me a little pep for the solo adventures ahead of me!",

We were 29 at the time.\n\nI was always a huge travel nerd, and had experience of travelling / living by myself from before we had gotten married. The transition to travelling solo for leisure after an emotionally stressful time was thus logistically easier. I had nothing to prove to myself, and the desire to see new places has always been intrinsic for me.\n\nHowever, what was new was the escapist element, and I wouldn't characterise that as undesirable in the least. It was honestly a relief to be somewhere by myself, in a place where no one knew me or my baggage, and consequently had no expectations of how I should behave, or possess a judgement on any 'character experiments' I tinkered with. I could choose to spend all day at a beach bar silently remembering my wife, or go rock climbing, or attend a party, or sleep in. No one would bother telling me what was 'appropriate behaviour' for a man in my position, and the absence of that influence played an important role in helping me process my loss better.",

I had never solo travelled so I started with a group tour where I didn't know anyone because I didn't want to deal with that first Christmas alone.  I ended up making some great friends and did a further trip where it was partially alone and partially with the friends I had met, and yes, the escapist element was so nice, no running into people who asked me how I was, or feeling like I had to be social when I didn't want to.  Also just knowing that if I wanted to go somewhere and do something I could, that I didn't need to wait for the perfect time and perfect travel partner was a really great feeling for me, and made me feel in control after losing so much control when my husband was sick.  \nI have a new partner now, and we're actually traveling in Italy at the moment, but knowing I can go it alone if need be is really great.",

Do expect moments where you might feel lonely or overwhelmed, and even a beachside drink won\u2019t feel good enough. At the same time, you might start feeling guilty about letting your emotions override the opportunity to see and visit a new place.\n\nThat\u2019s fairly normal, so try to take it in your stride. For me, a mid-trip funk goes away after a few days of taking things slow - staying in, resting it out, generally resetting - before jumping back into conventional touring. As your solo travel experience grows, you\u2019ll figure your own best way of handling such moments.",

I didn\u2019t stop missing my kids or feeling bad about the situation but each time I ventured out on my own I got a little more used to being alone and figuring myself out.

This will be done no matter where you are\n\nI have found that processing my feelings and going through very difficult emotional challenges while on a tropical beach, or in a fascinating foreign city, makes these tough time that much easier. \n\nIf you're going through hell, may as well do it in a beautiful place!\r  \n\r  \nBut you will go through the hell of it regardless of location. \n\nI think it is beneficial to remove yourself from the surroundings and habits that you associate with your ex. \n\nIt's nice to walk around a town and not get stung by a bad memory - or a good one! - at every corner, park, cafe and usual hangout. Everything is fresh is a new city. \n\nMy first solo trip to Europe I was 20. I imagined I would be a new person upon arriving in that new continent. I would be everything I was not at home. \n\nIt was a crushing blow when after two days in London, I realized I had brought \"old self\" along  with me! All that travel time, new city/country/continent, and still, same old me!\n\nTravel will do all those wonderful things you want: Give you a sense of independence, as well as a sense of accomplishment as you are doing and seeing the things you've always wanted to. \n\nBUT: You will most definitely be doing this as you go through your emotional recovery. \n\nAfter my divorce I took off to Vietnam. I spent many a day walking around Hoan Kiem Lake in Hanoi, dumping my memories and associated feelings into that lake. \n\nI'm sure if I return I will remember that time in my life, and those uncomfortable, unhappy feelings I had left there. But I do not encounter that all the time. And I need never return! And if I do, it will hopefully be under happier conditions.\n\nSo go abroad and dump all your crap there! \n\nIt is not a panacea. It will not instantly cure you of all your woes. \n\nBut if you are going to be going through a crappy emotional time, you may as well do it in a beautiful place to compensate. \n\nRemember: This too shall pass!\n\nYou will get through this, regardless of location. \n\nTo quote Mr. Churchill: If you find yourself going through hell, then keep on going!\n\nKind Regards,\n\nproperfckr",

Suddenly there were all the hostel people from all over the world with diverse vitas and interesting stories to tell.

Book a skydiving adventure or ride on a jeep while being chased by a rhino , or register for that annual event in Tokyo you always thought was a waste of money. \n\nDo it all and risk it all, then come back with a brand new perspective and fresh mindset.",

After a breakup, there is some self incrimination: \"what did i do wrong, what should i do next time, what is my true worth?\"\n\nif you just stay at home and do not think thru this stuff, i would posit that you are hiding from the reality  go out in the woods, and revitalize yourself, and figure out the path from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut i WOULD caution about jumping right into a new relationship too soon.  let the bits rattle around in your head and sort them out first.",

Your body and your mind have to unlearn a lot of \"we\" and learn more \"I\".\n\nExposing yourself to unfamiliar experiences and going outside your zone of comfort is a good way to die that.\n\n*And next time on \"asking the addicts whether drugs are cool: ....\"*",

            "comment": "The answer is probably yes to all of the above. And that's ok! On some level you clearly understand that you need a different environment to be able to process everything away from the life and people you know. Distract yourself from the situation while knowing that it's all churning away at the back of your subconscious, slowly being processed without you even having to do anything. After a while, clarity will come to you, along with a fresh perspective. \n\nLaugh at yourself as you cry looking out upon the most beautiful vista in the world. Have a grumpy lazy blanket day huddled up in a hammock in the jungle. Embrace the novelty. Let yourself be in whatever state you find yourself in without self-judgement and trust the process.",

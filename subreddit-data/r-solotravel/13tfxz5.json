I guess this would apply to smaller places, as I suppose large urban cities there would always be things you haven\u2019t seen but what about mid cities or rural areas? \n\nIf you do return, does the second trip have a different purpose than the first one? How do you make it count?",

Getting around is super easy, just get a passmo card when you get there. All the trains have romanized words (aka English versions) and many have English announcements. I would recommend Tokyo tower, Asakusa, Shibuya crossing, Akihabara, you know all the normal tourist stuff. I also like side trips to Mt. Takao and Nihon-ji both are nature side trips out of the city. Other than that I just like to wander around and see what there is to see and eat everything I can!",

I've also done a couple 2-3 day stays in Tokyo specifically to hit tourist spots before I went somewhere else.\n\nIf you're doing the main quintessential Tokyo tourist attractions, like Hachiko / Shibuya Crossing, Takeshita Street or Sky Tree, it's very easy to do it in 2-3 days because the metro is so amazing.\n\nI tend to recommend at least 5 days to really enjoy it. Places like Harajuku or Akihabara can be a 1-hour stop just to experience it, or it could be an all-day affair as you explore the nooks and crannies.",

The food is amazing (as it is many places but there's zero fear of getting sick), the ppl are kind, honest, and helpful, even if a little stand offish at times, and it's insanely easy to get around from subways in every major metro area to access to small towns in the middle of nowhere everything (practically) is easily accessible by train, add in buses, and trams and I've never found someplace I wanted to go that I couldn't. \n\nLearn just a few key phrases and ppl will be very grateful, use Google translate for everything else. Of course do all the popular tourist stuff, it's popular for a reason after all, and then pick out a few niche things that appeal to you. My first time I just went on Netflix/Hulu and watched tons of travel and food shows to get ideas, I even went so far as to take pictures of a few of the places so I could find them when I went. \n\nDon't over plan, you'll walk more in a day than you usually do in a week, so he prepared and make sure you have comfy shoes.\n\nDon't plan on taking taxis, they are a last resort and can be difficult/expensive at times. \n\nBe willing to eat things based on pictures without being completely certain what you're getting. Be prepared to eat at Lawson's/7-11/family mart for snacks and sometimes meals. \n\nDon't buy a JR pass unless you have a definitive plan to get your money's worth out of it.\n\nIf a local offers to help you, take it, they're (99.999%) not trying to scam or rob you. Talk to every local that talks to you, some are extremely friendly and just want to talk/hang out with a foreigner, they're as curious as you are. I still have friends I met this way.\n\nThe trains stop at midnight, and the last one is a glimpse at the unreserved noisy side of Japan, cause everyone is drunk. Take the drunk train at least once, it's a riot!\n\nUmm that's all I can think of off the top of my head ATM. Hmu with any specific questions, I'll help if I can.",

Plus it\u2019s usually fairly cheap and very quick to get to from where I live. Going back also means we can finesse trips as we know the most cost effective ways to do things such as the best supermarkets to shop at, where to buy fuel, rental agencies to go with, that kinda thing. \n\nI\u2019ve also returned to Finland many times, Helsinki predominantly. I just love the atmosphere, the natural beauty around the coast, the neighbourhoods. For me it\u2019s not so much seeing \u2018attractions\u2019 but experiencing the vibes, finding cool little spots to chill at for a day or get food or a decent drink.

I had always wanted to come back with more money and stay in the fancy hotels and go to the fancy restaurants, and then also by 12 years later I had gotten into birdwatching and got to experience that there for the first time.

I love the people I meet when I travel and they become part of the memory\u2026 I feel going back might make me miss them. Oh, I do go back if I want to see something I didn\u2019t see. For example, it was snowing when I was in Jerusalem the first time, so I went back again to explore it in better weather. Okay, guess I\u2019m zigzagging here and I may not have an answer\u2026 but typically I don\u2019t go back.",

            "comment": "Yeah, one repeat destination. Once as a solo female traveler, felt very safe.\n\nOnce pre covid and once when traveling was ok again, I visited Xi\u2019an twice. It wasn\u2019t even really because I loved the city, but a really great Chinese friend of mine/my personal trainer, who had a big hand in making my conversational Chinese as natural as it is, moved there and it had been a year since I\u2019d seen him. Before, I\u2019d gone on a Classical Chinese tour bus style trip. Im on mobile, so I can outline distinct differences/perks in both trips.\n\nGrand Tour (Bus):\nLots of tourist attractions like Terracotta Warriors, Huaqing Hotspring Palace, both historical pagodas and the drum tower, Muslim quarter, etc. very informative, interesting to observe from a cultural perspective, probably not to most westerner\u2019s tastes bc it is very structured and very educational. But, lots of bilingual guides in Xi\u2019an!\n\nPersonal Visit:\nVery nice hotel and very cheap first class ticket(just china things), I spent a lot of time sitting in the very nice bath tub taking baths that I hadn\u2019t been able to have for awhile, we went and got hot pot/got drunk, did some other buddy stuff, I went back to the Muslim quarter to wander around one evening, and I went to back the the drum and bell towers in the center of the city to see them at night; this was worth the site. We also went to a wildlife reserve outside of a city(unlikely you will have an easy time without a local, you have to travel by car through some mountains) and I got to see what was actually a really well cared for sanctuary with nice enclosures for red pandas, tigers, roaming planes for antelope/etc. it was neat, and he had never seen any of those animals before because gigantic Chinese metropolitan upbringing.\n\nTl;dr:\nI think if a cool opportunity presents itself and you are returning, might as well. It will be a much more relaxed trip and you will have a better idea of what you want to visit again/hit next time, and takes the pressure off of the number of things you choose to do your first go around.",

            "comment": "In 2013 I traveled for 4 months through SE Asia. Java, Bali, boat to Komodo and Rinca, and back to Bali. My plan was to go to Lombok after Rinca, but because of heavy waves at sea, our only option was flying back to Bali. Here I stayed in Sanur for the last 9 days. I had a great time in Sanur the first time and the second time was also good. \n\nAfter Indonesia I traveled to Singapore, Vietnam, Bali and Malaysia. \n\nI lost my debit card in Indonesia and my brother would send a new one to a friend on Bali. Yet my brother was kind of lazy and it took him 3 weeks before sending it. So when it finally arrived, I was already halfway Vietnam. I decided to go back to Sanur, Bali. I needed my debit card, because I only had my credit card with me. Losing that would have caused big problems. \nThe third time visiting Bali was different. It was okay. Sanur was fun, but overall I didn\u2019t enjoy my stay over there. \n\nIn Malaysia I didn\u2019t travel much in 3 weeks. KL, Malacca, Cameron Highlands and Penang. \n\nOne year later I arrived back in KL for 3 nights after traveling from Australia. I had good memories of KL and enjoyed my stay there. Again, I didn\u2019t do much. I was still recovering from 3 months of Australian jungle and cities were pretty much a sensory overload. \n\nOver the years I never went back a second time. I traveled to a lot of places before and after 2013, alone and together, but I never went back a second time. Almost every destination was great and I always wanted to go back. But also not. If you asked me why, it is probably a combination of memories and sentiment. Sentiment would draw me going back, but it also would withhold me of going back. Going back would be different and I was heavily cherishing the good moment I\u2019ve once experienced. That happened once and you can\u2019t redo or replace those good moments. Also, and this is extremely important to me, the urge of discovering new places has always been more important to me.\n\nIn 2022 I decided I wanted to go back to Bali. Not alone, but with my wife. I wanted to share my travels and experiences. Faith decided we would also visit KL, Cameron Highland and Penang before flying to Bali. I absolutely loved and enjoyed Malaysia! I didn\u2019t expected it. I was kind of reluctant going back to Malaysia. Because we\u2019re already going to Bali and I also wanted to discover something new. \nBali was great to be back! Ubud was still much the same, but I was shocked how bad the traffic had gotten. In 2013 it was already terrible. Now it was even worse. While in Ubud we did new things and the things I did back then. \nSanur on the other hand sucked. The effects of the pandemic were clearly visible. But it was different. The entire place didn\u2019t had the vibe it once had. Sanur is a good place to stay when you have to go the airport and discover the southern part of Bali. Nonetheless I wouldn\u2019t stay in Sanur anymore. Would I go back to Bali? Absolutely! But I probably would stay just outside of Ubud. Or somewhere else.\n\nMy SO and I stayed first 2 nights in Bangkok before arriving in KL last year. In 2016 we were there also. We spend respectively 3, 2, 2 nights and 1 day there. I lost my passport. Pro tip, don\u2019t loose your passport. TBH I was kind sick of Bangkok in 2016. But Bangkok was fun last year. We didn\u2019t do much there. We were planning to spend the last 3 days at the end of our holiday in Bangkok, but again, faith decided differently. We only had 2 nights and I was suffering from food poisoning that took 2 weeks. \n\nThis year I am going back to Singapore. But now with my SO. We are also going back to Bangkok for 3 nights. Can\u2019t wait to come back!.",

I think it's a great walking city and I love walking along the canals. I go in late fall when tourism is lower so I can enjoy the museums without so many crowds, and get into any bar or restaurant I feel like going to for the most part.  \nI also love Paris. I stay in different locations and do most of my eating in the local area. I'm an impressionist nut so I can go through several museums every year given the chance. I love the food, the outdoor cafes, the wine, and the history.  \nAnd I've been to Frankfurt quite a few times for business and also think it's a great city to explore and walk. The seafood is great, the cured meats are amazing, I love the little markets, of course the beer, and I find it a fun city. I went to Dusseldorf recently also and I liked it for a lot of the same reasons and the Alt beer is great.  \nI recently tried someplace new and went to Lisbon and the southern coast of Portugal. I'd definitely go back. I loved the water activities and the seafood is as good as any I've ever had.",

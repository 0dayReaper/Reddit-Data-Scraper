    "postText": "It started early. I had a 1.25 hr layover in Istanbul, a very tight layover for that airport. and I wasn't able to print both boarding pass ahead so that was going to be tough. But then the morning of the trip when I was still at work I got a notice that the plane was going to be delayed 30 min, So there was no way I was going to make that transfer. So I got on the phone with Turkish Airlines and they couldn't do anything over the phone but told be there was an earlier flight that I might be able to get on but they couldnt book it for me, I just had to go to the airport desk and hope they can get a me a seat. I asked my boss to leave early and they actually did and I got onto the earlier flight but that would have a knock on effect at the end. I did also get an email that said my connecting flight was reschedule because of the initial delay but didn't think much of it because i go to Europe... Shouldn't have ignored that.\n\n\nBut I got to Budapest without a crazy long layover or losing a day. Start of a 15 day vacation. More jet lag than normal but that helped in Budapest to stay up late. Then I got on a night train to Krakow. Only 1 other person in the cabin and they took the top bunk. I took the middle and shoved my bag under the seat. I had a slight cold and woke up crazy thirsty and out of water so I went to buy some, went back to sleep, woke up in Krakow and realized my bag was not there... I did recall passing someone at night but didn't think much of it at the time. But thinking back it must have been when he bag was stolen. If I had my bag in the overhead or clipped it to a bar it could have been avoided. Lessons learned. I did lose my passport but luckily Krakow has a consulate that want too crowed and it only took a half day to get an emergency passport made. I did some shopping to replace my everything in the mean time. The only thing I really regret losing was the old passport that I kept as a back up ID. It had allot of stamps from my early journeys that couldn't be replaced. Everything else just boiled down to money to replace. \n\n\nJet lag also caught up and I got a private room and crashed for 16 hours. Shout out to Dizzy Daisy in Krakow for being so accommodating moving my dorm reservation to a private, and helping me with all my issues. \n\n\nIt was smooth sailing from there until the last day. I had a 6am flight and I hasped to be up early the day before and decided to get my boarding pass early... entered in my booking number and there was nothing there... \n\n\nImmediately got on the phone with Turkish Airlines, the first guy barely spoke english and had no idea was was the problem just repeating \"open ticket\" over and over again but could tell me what it meant. Called again and the send girl also didn't know anything, said my ticket was canceled, coulnt tell me why. Called a 3rd time and got someone who knew what they were doing and could explain it. It seem my flight back was canceled because I was no show for my flight out... But I was sitting in Europe. I always take a picture of my boarding pass so I could prove that flew. The rep said he can book a new ticket but there would be lots of charges totaling up to 1100 euro or I can leave a feedback with Turkish airline and they could do something? I decided to try to get something solid and get a refund later and I had someone helpful so i asked them to book a ticket but then the credit card didn't go through. So with no other option i left a feedback and it could be up to 7 days to get a response... FML The 3rd rep said he could escalate it to urgent and send an email but I had low hopes but out of options. So i left the feed back an waited an hour. Called back with the feed back ticket number and it  was not marked urgent, but I explained my situation and he marked it urgent and said i will hear back in a couple hours this is around 10-11 am. Meanwhile after the first 3 calls around 9 am, I was also talking to the Hostel staff about my situation asking them to please hold a bed for me just incase, normally they would need to know by check out at 10 but Wombats in Vienna was nice and said they could hold the last bed for me until 2 without a charge. \n\n\nSo I just cooled my heels for a few hours, luckily it was the Naschmarkt fleemarket day which was part of my plans, so I could do some browsing and get lunch. Right at 1 I got an email with a ticket info. Called to confirm and logged it and my ticket was there. it was sorted and I actually had time to do what I wanted to do on my last day in Vienna anyway. \n\n\nTLDR \nCheck your tickets if you get rebooked and secure your bags.",

Since then I\u2019ve been to ~30 countries all over Latin American and Asia, and I managed to travel the most challenging countries (including 3 months solo in Brazil) without getting anything valuable stolen from me (we don\u2019t count some stollen flip flops right?)\n\nI\u2019m happy I got my lesson on a 5 day trip in Spain where I have friends. I learnt the lesson in the least painful way. Could have been way worse if that happened somewhere in the middle of nowhere in Laos or Nicaragua. \n\nWe live and we learn, and then we continue traveling. Good luck with your future trips!

I wear mine under my clothes so I can always feel it against my body, and so I know it's still there. It's either on my body on in a hotel safe, never anywhere else.\n\nI keep copies of all important documents inside, and some emergency cash. It can really alleviate the fear of having your critical documents stolen or lost.\n\nDon't let fear stop you from doing things! If you take the proper precautions, you'll be alright.",

For example, never book flights with such tight layovers as OP, in most big airports 1.5 hour layover is gonna end up being stressful. Also, always keep your passport on yourself, especially when you sleep on night busses/trains/planes. Buy a small fanny pack and keep your passport, phone and credit card there, strap it around your waist or across the body and wear it on the front of your body. When asleep on the train, put it under your pillow, on the bus strap it around yourself under your hoodie.",

    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI (30M) am planning a UK trip for late June and am keen to check out the Lake District.  My current itinerary is to take the train from Edinburgh down to Windermere and stay in the area for 3 days/2 nights, and then take a train back into London for the rest of my trip.  I'm assuming I'll be there on my own but there's a chance a friend or two will end up tagging along.\n\nMy initial idea was to stay in Windermere for the proximity to the train station and other amenities, but I was wondering if it would be worth the trouble to stay in one of the other towns such as Keswick, Grasmere, Ambleside, or somewhere more off the beaten path.  I am a little concerned that Windermere will be crowded and full of families.\n\nHere are the criteria I'm using to help decide.  Budget is not really a concern although I wouldn't see the need to spend more than $200 USD/night on accommodation.  Again I'd really prefer not to have to rent a car, but if I'd really be missing out majorly without one, I'd consider it.  Totally cool with renting a bike, taking a ferry, or taking an uber (if that's available?).\n\n1.) Proximity to good hikes - hopefully I would be able to get to 2-3 good hikes (maybe two shorter ones and one longer one given my limited time frame) without needing to drive/uber anywhere.\n\n2.) As for other activities...I am not necessarily set on anything besides some good hiking, but would be open to rock climbing/bouldering and kayaking/canoeing.  Or if there's any other cool/unique outdoor activities I'd be missing out on, I'm open to it.\n\n3.) Access to some restaurants/cafes/bars would be nice.  Don't need to have a million options or anything too fancy, but I'm definitely not looking to cook every meal.\n\n4.) I am not super worried about seeing sites such as museums/castles/houses etc., since I likely will have done a lot of that in London and Edinburgh leading up to this.  Not opposed to it per se, just doesn't rank high on my priorities for this part of the trip.\n\n5.) Last but not least, would prefer a traveler crowd as opposed to all families/retirees.  I suppose this may be a lot to ask for the Lake District during high season.  It would be nice to have the option to socialize with like-minded folks, but I am also planning on using this time to recharge my social batteries after staying in hostels for the first part of the trip.  I would be totally content to stay somewhere small/remote if the bigger towns are going to be the equivalent of the Disney World crowd.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Keswick would probably be the best balance of accessibility and distance to the fells.",

Appreciate the keswick rec, seems like a good balance of everything.  \n\nI am vaguely considering the Scottish highlands instead if the crowds would really be out of hand, but I\u2019m guessing that would almost certainly need a car.",

    "postText": "I have one week in July. Got a flight already booked home from Beirut at the end. Originally planned to do the whole thing in Lebanon but was an impulse decision and its beginning to look like I bit off a bit more than I can chew.\n\n\nRelatively experienced - have solo travelled SE Asia and Europe before but never the middle east\n\n\nOriginal plan: Spend a few days in Beirut, work north to Tripoli via Byblos, Batroun and some nature sites over a few days, back to Beirut, fly home\n\n\nNew plan: Spend 5 days in Jordan: Amman, day trips out to Petra and Jerash, fly to Beirut for a few days then home\n\n\nReason for change - Lebanon outside of Beirut looks a bit challenging, locals and tourists suggest getting local guides, I have no idea how to source that and not a huge budget (would only really be able to pay up to \u00a320 daily for a guide - maybe more if it wasnt every day)\n\n\nJordan seems to be much less of a challenge and could ease me into being in that region, I could cap the trip off with a few days in Beirut, plus Petra looks sick.\n\n\nI'd be staying in hostels and wont be renting any cars\n\n\nThoughts from anyone who's been to these places are much appreciated!!! Thanks",

That being said since you only have a week you'd need to either take taxis or go with a guide/hire someone to drive you. Petrol was really expensive when I was there so taxis and drivers weren't so cheap. You can use Uber and Bolt to get around, but just in Beirut. I was able to take an Uber to and from Jeota Grotto though.",

    "postText": "Hey I was just wondering how many people out there choose to primarily solo travel because they can't find people that want to travel?\n\nI'm a 31M Canadian and have a really hard time finding people to travel with outside of resorts which I mostly find boring now. I've done 3 solo trips and am about to book my 4th in the next few weeks after PTO is approved, and I have one 2 week trip booked with a friend.\n\nI have a really hard time finding like minded people, and would really rather find people to travel and explore with (Even for just part of the trip) but the idea of taking a 10 hour flight anywhere turns off a lot of my friends and family, so I just end up going solo.\n\nanyone else solo travel because of this or similar reasons? I don't mind it but like I said, I would prefer to have a person or two with me while I'm out there to share some memories with.  \n\n\nEdit: I didn't think this would get that much traction but its really cool to see the reactions. Still taking some time to read through it all!\n\nFor some reason I thought that everyone on here was the \"into the wild\" type of solo traveler and that I was the oddball for actually wanting company while I travel. I've only been on a handful of trips but the experiences shared here are so validating of some of the \"not so awesome\" experiences that I've had so far. \n\nThank you all for sharing! ",

But it's  nice to just go where your heart takes you. Don't worry about others if it isn't workable to go with them. Just book that flight and enjoy the adventure.\n\nI only regret that I did not take a day trip to Florence.

We do a lot of short trips within the state but she does not go out of state unless one can drive there in a day.\n\nI went to London earlier this year solo &amp; was a little worried about it, but honestly it was one of the best trips ever.

The first time I went it was because nobody else was available in the week I had off, so I did a trip to the Netherlands. It\u2019s rare that my friends and I all have the same availability/money/desire to travel simultaneously. I think of more as not being limited by needing a companion. \n\nI also enjoy it for different reasons. Most of my friends have a totally different travel style to me: they\u2019re a bit freaked out by hostels unless we can get a room to ourselves, don\u2019t like talking to strangers, won\u2019t go near a pub crawl, stuff like that. Which is totally fine and then the trip is mostly about spending time with them. Whereas when I travel solo, it becomes more about venturing out, talking to people, making new connections. There\u2019s pros and cons. I love the freedom and flexibility of solo travel, but sometimes I wish I had someone to bounce ideas off of or just talk to when I\u2019ve had a run of bad luck meeting people. Overall I definitely prefer solo travel, but I\u2019ll never turn down a weekend trip with a few close friends.",

It always became such a pain to find the like-minded person, with similar time, funds, interest etc I learned decades decades ago just do it myself. I still enjoy on occasion, meeting up with somebody in Europe, if I'm out and about for six or eight weeks. It's a nice change to me up with a kindred soul for 7 days perhaps. But then I've had enough. It's wonderful to be free like the wind and go where you wish to be at any given time. The loneliness factor is far away by the freedom",

I knew him for years but of course, traveling with someone you get to know them even more and he turned out to be a completely different traveler than I am. \n\nHe booked hostels because they were affordable but I never knew there were community rooms where you can meet friends. I loved it and talked to many people. He did hang a little but always ends up going back to our room early in the night. He often likes to go to bars and clubs almost every night. I dont mind it but I couldnt do it when he wanted to go 4th time in a row. I ended up staying in the hostel to hang with people I just met. To top it off, he never wanted to do anything during the day. Like almost at all but sit in his bed or common room and use his phone. I kind of got fed up and just went out to take a walk and won't even care if I got lost. It was the first time I went out to eat alone at a restaurant (after hanging around outside with anxiety for about 20 minutes). \n\nI soon realized that I always worked on his schedule and didnt come up with something on my own. I definitely got to know myself at that point during that trip. We still talk and hang to this day, just dont think I can travel with him anymore, and im happy with that. \n\nThat was 8 years ago and been to 4 or 5 solo trips. loved every single one of them",

Plus I\u2019m more of a planner and so the planning would tend to fall on me, which is so much more troublesome than planning your own solo trip. Once I started solo traveling I haven\u2019t looked back. Still happy to take trips with friends if they\u2019re interested/available, but not worth trying to force it to happen.",

I wouldn\u2019t trade that freedom for the world.\n\nOf course once in a while I still go on holidays with some friends and they\u2019re always decently nice experiences, but a lot of the times they have different expectations than me and I\u2019ve been happy to accommodate, but I absolutely love just waking up whenever I want, going wherever I want to go, chilling wherever. Not many of my friends would be super keen to just lay down in a nice park for an entire afternoon halfway across the world! And that\u2019s fine.\n\nI\u2019ve also had many people asking to join me on trips, and while I\u2019ve been reserved at first I always let them decide whether or not they really want to come. Most of the time of course nothing comes of it and I never expect anything so it doesn\u2019t affect me. One time, a friend joined me for a month in Finland and Germany and while it was overall a nice trip there were some difficult moments and I didn\u2019t totally love sharing a room with a buddy for a month straight.

I've always stopped myself from traveling because of money, getting days off or lack of PTO, or getting other people to go with me.\n\n\n2017 - solo traveled to North Carolina to visit a friend. First time traveling not \"work-related\".\n\n\n2019, Nov - started working at my current job, so no PTO.\n\n\n2020 - covid happened and couldn't go anywhere. But thanks to this, I was able to rack up my PTO.\n\n\n2022 - Travel restrictions started to ease a bit, and the covid booster was available. Took a 4-day solo trip to Las Vegas. First time going to Vegas.\n\n\n2023, July 11 to July 21 - Will be visiting Japan solo. Will be staying in Tokyo -&gt; Kyoto -&gt; Hakone. Couldn't find anyone to visit with me. First international trip for me.\n\n\nJapan is one of the places that I've always wanted to visit at least once. It wasn't until October or November of last year that their country was finally opened for tourism.\n\n\nTrip is next month, but looking at how much money I have spent so far makes me feel a bit guilty and a bit regretful. But I always remind myself that this might be my only chance to visit. This year alone, I had 1 coworker and 1 of my cousin pass away both around 40 years or younger. I also do not know if there will be another pandemic and the world shuts down, if WWIII breaks out, if Japan becomes hostile to the USA, I become disabled, a natural disaster happens, etc. Though I am a bit worried about going solo, I do not know if I will get another opportunity to visit. And I do plan to travel more even if I have to go solo. Just... after I recover financially a bit first haha.",

Being a student means = little to no cash, so whenever we made it work, we went off. I realized that I had different views on traveling, while they preferred to lounge around, I always wanted to go, go, go and learn and see and experience things new to me. I was open to new cultures and people and foods, while some of them preferred to stay in their comfort zones. Which I was fine with and obliged to. But I felt like I was missing potential moments of self growth.\nSome time, it was the money issue and I told myself at 23 that I would stop waiting around. As an introvert, doing things by myself doesn\u2019t bother me much, but the unknown was scary at first. Now at 28, I enjoy doing things on my own schedule so much. Of course at parts it would be lovely to have a companion, but I mostly do it for myself, my own pleasure.

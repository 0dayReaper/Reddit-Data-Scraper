I\u2019m into biomes that look a little extraterrestrial.. i love beaches with rock pools in australia, or the baths in the british virgin islands. Are there any beaches in Europe that have similar cool rock formations near the beach? I can\u2019t find much info on this through google but maybe am not looking in the right spots?",

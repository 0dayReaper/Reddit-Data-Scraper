    "postText": "to add carryon\\*\\*\\^\\^ Currently debating getting the 10 day/2 month eurorail pass vs Point-to-point and flights. I'm looking at a flight from London&gt;Barcelona for $102, but since I have my Osprey FP40 and a north face recon as my personal, I'd need to get the \"regular\" upgrade for $32. However it adds reserved seating which I don't care about. Is there an option/cheaper to just pay for the bag fee at the gate instead of upgrading the whole ticket?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrip starts tomorrow and I have zero bookings or plans done lol.. pray for me",

I'm currently planning out parts of my trip as i go, but i made sure i bought all the places im staying for the next 3 months, just buying the trains/buses 2 weeks before",

Does that sound like a decent plan? Antwerp sounded like a better base than Brussels based on what I've read.\n\nNow...anyone have any specific places they would recommend visiting? My interests (in order of priority) would be: Belgian beer (Trappist styles are my fav), good food, history (WWII), chocolate, architecture/art\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "For Amsterdam make sure you book museum tickets in advance, especially popular attractions like Anne Frank house and the Van Gough. These also allow you to skip the line. \n\nBelgian beer is pretty ubiquitous at like every place you go. Even just mid tier restaurants have beer menus that look like wine lists in most countries.  There's also brewery locations in the cities. If you make it to Brussels check out Cantillon Brewery. Cheers!",

There\u00b4s no train, but a bus from Antwerp (direction Turnhout) stops very close to the abbey and the bar where you can drink their beers.\n\nMost other trappists are far away.\n\n\nBrussels is a much better (more central) to explore the country, but if you\u00b4d only stay in the north and NW Antwerp is also good. Brussels is by train just as far (perhaps 5 or 10 minutes faster) to Ghent and Bruges as Antwerp.\n\n\nBest places gor WWII in Belgium are:\n1. Bastogne, battle of the Bulge. Best place, but far away in the south;\n2. Eben Emael fort. Very impressive and important. Also pretty far away from Bxl and Antwerp. It\u00b4s near Li\u00e8ge;\n3. Atlantikwall. It\u00b4s a the coast in Raversijde (Ostend).\n\nEdit 4. Kaserne Dossin in Mechelen and fort Breendonk nearby for the gruesome history of deportations and political prisoners.",

            "comment": "Just got back from Amsterdam earlier this week. I basically had 1 full day and 3 evenings there, and honestly I wish I would have had 2-3 more days. There is a lot to see. We did day trips to Lisse (for the tulips, but they\u2019ll be gone when you\u2019re there), Rotterdam (would suggest if you\u2019re into modern architecture), and Ghent Belgium.\n\nFor Amsterdam, definitely I suggest a canal boat tour asap after arriving. It helps get the lay of the land, some history on the neighborhoods, canals, and architecture, and if you\u2019re on a small tour you\u2019ll have lots of opportunity to ask the guide questions/get recommendations. Airbnb experiences has a bunch of them, many with drinks and snacks included. We did a tour with a company called Captain Jack and our guide was very informative. Sebi boat tours has a nice intimate one as well. Anne Frank house is a must-see, but you have to book in advance online. Definitely have to walk around the red light district at night and go to a coffee shop once if you\u2019re into weed at all or just want the experience (The Old Church is nice and chill, I didn\u2019t go to any others). One thing we didn\u2019t get to do that I would add to your list if you get a chance is Zaanse Schans, where they have a lot of traditional Dutch houses and windmills. For food the amount of restaurants is overwhelming, but I recommend checking out the Foodhallen, it\u2019s a big market with lots of options including traditional Dutch foods like bitterballen and krokets. Don\u2019t be afraid to flag the staff down for your check at restaurants (in Belgium also), it seemed like they wouldn\u2019t come otherwise and were not offended by it. This is a great city for solo travel! Most people are very friendly and chatty, most everyone speaks fluent english, most places take credit/debit, and the public transportation is super easy. I booked it intending for a solo trip, then a friend ended up tagging along. Would definitely go back solo though!\n\nIn Ghent I recommend a canal boat tour too for the history. They are cheap and don\u2019t need to be booked ahead. For a variety of good beer (including trappist) check out Het Waterhuis aan de Bierkant. If you do the boat tour, it\u2019s the big white building that says Bierhaus on it. You must try Belgium waffles obviously, we had breakfast at 't verschil along the water and the banana &amp; chocolate waffle was amazing. Frites Atelier has good fries and croquettes, and also people watching. Check out St. Michael\u2019s bridge and the surrounding buildings, and the Gravensteen castle tour was interesting (with an awesome view of the town from the top). We planned to stop in Antwerp too since it was on the bus route, but honestly we enjoyed Ghent so much and just googling we didn\u2019t find anything to be a must-see for us in Antwerp, so we skipped it. \n\nEnjoy your trip!",

We arrived at Schipol and spoke to the ticketing agent who advised us to buy a multi-day pass for the trams/bus (for WITHIN Amsterdam and farther out to regions like Zaanse Schans (lovely--fun spot for half a day or less). (Belgium won't count in this.) Back to the IAM pass, you can download the app and scroll through it; do the math to see if it's worth the cost. If it is, you can purchase it and activate with the first spot you go to. Do look carefully at it as there are a lot of \"free\" things listed that are free anyway. I used the app as a bit of guide to find those spots and focused more on that. But I've been to the city several times and gone to various places I didn't need to repeat (like the Sex Museum!). Have a great time! Amsterdam is lovely. Watch out for cyclists, though. They can be a aggressive. :)",

            "comment": "Doesn't look like anyone has mentioned 3 Fonteinen as I type this.  It's about a 25-30 minute train ride outside of Brussels.  Definitely worth visiting if one likes beers from Cantillon.\n\nAlso can't think of many advantages/disadvantages of using Antwerp as a base vs Brussels.  I've visited both and they're both nice but one doesn't stand out.  However I like that Cantillon and 3 Fonteinen are close to Brussels.  Depending where one is staying in Brussels... could walk to Cantillon.  Can make multiple trips there.  There are tons of tourist in the main square of Brussels but can avoid if one doesn't want to mess with.  There are tourist in Antwerp too of course but seems more intense in Brussels.\n\nSomeone mentioned De Konick... that beer is nice.  Very drinkable.  Not if it's still true but heard can only be found in kegs in Antwerp (saw on the menu somewhere in Brussels last week but not sure if it was bottle or keg).  So good and costs so little in Antwerp!",

I wasn't able to go to Anne Frank house because it was the one thing I didn't reserve ahead of time. As for Belgium I'd definitely take a day trip from Brussels to Brugges. It became a highlight of my trip and enjoyed it much more than Brussels. It's only about an hour by train and then take the bus right from the train station to Brugges.",

It may be boring to you, but I really enjoyed my time on the bike and getting some take out I found to eat in the park. I like to people watch.  I took a canal tour via PureBoats that was decent (more pricey than the other tours, but it was very clean, came with good drinks, a snack, and smaller groups-there were other solos too), if you're interested in doing a tour and learning a little history.  If the tulip gardens are still open when you go, I recommend it. It was surprisingly enjoyable and more than I imagined.",

Good choice basing yourself there instead of Brussels, but Brussels is still worth a daytrip, especially with your interests. \nThe good thing of arriving by train is that you can immediately visit the (in my opinion) most beautiful building in Antwerp, the station!\nFor typical Belgian food I can recommend \u2018De Bomma\u2019, though it\u2019s a bit on the expensive side. \nDe Konick is the local Antwerp beer and you can visit their brewery (Antwerp City Brewery). Not too far from there is the Cogels-Osylei. It\u2019s a street with the most beautiful eclectic houses of Antwerp. I\u2019ve seen many tours passing through there, so if you could find one I think that would be more interesting to really understand the history of the place. \nBelgian beers and brews is a good shop to buy some bottles, right in the center next to the cathedral. Definitely also visit the cathedral inside if you\u2019re interested in that. I\u2019ve seen many around Europe and the Antwerp cathedral is one of my favourites (and not just because I\u2019m a local). \nThe chocolate museum is nice, but I would suggest visiting only if you know little about chocolate at the moment. It\u2019s not something to necessarily do if you have limited time. If you pass through \u2018de Meir\u2019 (the main shopping street) you could always have a look at The chocolate line, which is the store of Dominique Persoone, a famous chocolatier. And next to it is a good waffle stand!\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",

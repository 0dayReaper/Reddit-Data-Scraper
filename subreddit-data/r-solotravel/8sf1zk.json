I know everyone\u2019s in different financial situations - I\u2019m in a weird situation in that I took a gap year off between high school and college and saved up money. Also I was in a situation where I had to come home across the country one way or another so I decided to do train instead of plane (which wasn\u2019t much more expensive even with stops).",

A coach seat on that train ride is $145, but you can also get roomettes but that\u2019s pretty expensive. You have to get separate segments though if you want to stop places like I\u2019m doing. [This website](https://m.amtrak.com/h5/r/www.amtrak.com/california-zephyr-train) has much more info.",

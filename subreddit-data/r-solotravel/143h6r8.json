    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nNext month I'll be going on my first solo backpacking trip through Ecuador and I need some advice in terms of a particular hike I want to embark on!\n\nIt's called the **El Altar Trek**, and it supposedly takes 3 days to complete it. My problem is that I have no idea where I'm going to spend the nights. There are guided tours I can sign up for that include accommodations but those are extremely expensive and the whole point of coming to Ecuador was so it would be cheap.\n\nThere are a few lodges or cabins that some blogs and articles mention but I can never find a website to book nights or anything. Do most people just bring camping gear and camp along the way? How do I get access to these cabins or even a MAP so I know where I'll be sleeping or how far I have to trek to get to the next destination? \n\nI genuinely cannot find any information for a solo backpacker. **Everything I see online is people talking about their experience but guided by a tour company.**\n\nPlease help, I am desperate to go on this hiking trip and I don't care if it takes me four days.\n\nA. Sleeping in those lodges would be the best\n\nB. If that is not possible without a guided tour that reserves spots, where do I even camp\n\nC. There isn't even a map or anything about the trek. Am I going to just get lost?",

Don\u2019t worry about booking ahead, just show up. Once your in Riobamba ask your hostel, this is a very popular trek",

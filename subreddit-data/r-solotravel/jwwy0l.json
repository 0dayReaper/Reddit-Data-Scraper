            "comment": "Totally agree, but to be honest I wish I didn\u2019t feel that way so often. Personally I\u2019m trying to find fulfillment in my normal life as well, otherwise it turns into always \u201cchasing\u201d something such as the next new city or the next tropical island. When you get home you\u2019ll inevitably start to feel unfulfilled after a week or so if you aren\u2019t seeking fulfillment in your every day life.\n\nBUT there is something irreplaceable about travel in particular. Maybe it\u2019s the inspiring and humbling new experiences or cultural exposure that\u2019s hard to find in daily life. Basically I think it\u2019s entirely valid and healthy to see travel as a means to living life to its fullest, as long as you\u2019re aware that it shouldn\u2019t be the only thing defining your happiness and fulfillment.",

I think of all the people who i rely on to make my experience great - all of them have a local perspective and culture that would be diminished if everyone was on the road. so its recently made me feel that i need to balance travel with contributing to my own local culture. who knows- i may make someone elses travel experience that much greater :)",

What makes travel more exciting than discovering your own neighborhood is basically the feeling, that you allow yourself to have while traveling. You are more open to meet new people, you share more of your personal things with them, you are more likely to go alone to a bar and a restaurant and you will be out more because that is why you travel. To be around and see things. My opinion is just, that you need to create a feeling of travel also when you are at home. And then the whole life will be a big vacation.  \nBtw - I still travel.

And then some was just luck. I was always ambitious in that I slaved away to get myself a well-paying job that gives me the opportunity to \"buy\" myself time to travel - sounds odd, but is true. My company offers a lot of flexibility - in exchange for delivery and performance. Being at this type of company is largely the lucky part. What I did with it was a choice. From taking a sabbatical to travel around the world to travelling for work and being able to extend trips into personal ones to simply being able to afford the occasional unpaid week or two - all an outcome of hard work plus luck - and also the balls to ask for all of it ;) All these were options available to me - I simply asked and went for it.\n\nIt wasn't always like this - I was a broke-ass student juggling an almost-full-time job while being at uni for 6 years as undegrad and then grad student (and adding another degree later while working full-time). But that in itself was another choice - I knew I needed to do this to be able to afford myself more freedom later. Again a choice. But then my country doesn't know student loans the way the US does, so I came out of uni broke but not in debt. That certainly helped a lot - that was the luck part.\n\nIt also helps that I'm naturally and almost fiercely self-sufficient and while I got a lot of shit for it, especially when younger and still sometimes today, it helps. I'm not a massive risk-taker, but I'm not risk-averse either - hence my balance between stability (job, mortgage) and freedom (independence, travel). I used to be enormously torn between the two, thinking it could be only one or the other. As I got older, I realized the two don't have to be mutually exclusive - and here we are. I occasionally tip a bit further into one extreme, usually towards the \"I just want to break the hell out entirely\" - but it's become rare. I literally recognize these days in my mood and even as a physical sesation that I need a change of scenery and go on some trip. And then I do what I need to do.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are downsides and there were and are sacrifices. There are things I will never have - though those were also conscious decisions. I never expected to have everything in life, nor do I strive for it. I know the way I want to and do live simply means I will not have some of the other options I could have chosen but didn't. But if you're true to who you are, none of this will feel like sacrifice. And if you're honest with yourself about what's really important to you, life tends to offer it to you - there are always ways to create opportunities. We may not always see them right away but they're there.",

This was perpetuated by an overwhelming feeling of self-loathing (which I still have), classic FOMO and those lists of THINGS YOU MUST DO BEFORE YOU DIE. (Or else what, list?)\n\nPart of the reason I stopped worrying about that was when I became a journalist. And I discovered that while a lot of journos go to amazing places, no person has done the '50 museums to see before you die' list. It's just put together by people who have never set foot there. I went to the Museum of Beaux Arts in Santiago. It was... all right? But I would rate the Chiswick Pencil Museum higher. \n\nI've stopped worrying about living to the full and started to embrace living how I choose. I travel continuously now, but I don't worry if I don't see a certain thing. I'm currently on Jeju Island in Korea. It's beautiful, and I climbed that damn mountain, went into a lava tube and saw the penis museum. I do not feel any burning need to see the western coast though; seen enough coasts. I prefer some days to spend my time in my hotel room, playing PC games and occasionally wandering down to get more Cola and the odd pork delicacy. \n\nThis mode of travel is far more fun. I don't ache unless I want to. I don't feel a ticking clock. I don't piss away money on seeing utterly pointless things (that much). \n\nI have already seen more of this world than any member of my family will: more than all who went before me and, thanks to climate change and the problems of future travel, more than any who comes next.",

I'm in my 40s and my parents are in their 70s.  They started traveling internationally from the US within the last 7 or 8 years.  They go a lot of places with package tours,  and many of their experiences are measured against how well reality matched their expectations that they formed years ago.  Example:  I ask my parents about their trip to Italy, how was the food?  \"Not enough garlic\".  That's it.  I realized that their benchmark was the local Midwestern Italian restaurant that they've been eating at for years.

Most children are able to travel without freaking out, unlike my dog. I guess if you're bottle-feeding a baby it would be hard.\n\nWe even traveled when my younger kid was still unable to walk far on her own because of foot problems. The rest of us took turns carrying her and checked out a wheelchair occasionally. She was small for her age, so that helped. She watched the IMAX film about the space shuttle at the Smithsonian Air and Space museum seven or eight times while the rest of us traded off running around the museum. Now she's in graduate school in robotics engineering and dreams of working for NASA. Travel is good for kids. It helps them see possibilities.\n\nIt's not solo travel, but TBH I'd rather travel with kids than without. They're way more honest than adults about how they feel about things, and they allow me to act more wild and crazy without being self-conscious. Maybe it's because my kids had similar interests to mine so we weren't compromising or dragging them anywhere they didn't want to go. I'm not big on fine dining and night life.",

I\u2019m in my mid-30s now, and my constant internal debates are (1) maybe I should have saved more and travelled less in my 20s (I was studying in a developed country in Europe then, wasn\u2019t earning that much but decent enough) and (2) maybe I should just set aside time and money spent on traveling on savings for something big for future passive income?

    "postText": "This has been playing on my mind recently and it'll inevitably be divisive but I definitely feel like some people are doing solo travel for the wrong reasons.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't want to gatekeep it, in fact I'm an advocate for it and have recommended doing it to several people over the years but some experiences I read on this sub especially make me think.\n\nSome people are travelling solo specifically to make friends, why? Sort of defeats the purpose. Some people have travel/solo anxiety and are doing it, again I get throwing yourself out into the big world but I wouldn't recommend potentially causing a mental breakdown or panic attack just to be abroad.\n\nI think people just need to ask themselves why they want to solo travel, most peoples reasons I'm sure are fine and I'm not here to question exploring, experiencing new things etc. But for friendship, love, feeling like 'you have to' because it feels like everyone's doing it. No, do it because you actually want to.",

I think that many people haven't spent much if any time alone before they decide to solo travel and when they're actually really alone they realize that they aren't  comfortable with it. That's totally fine! It can take time to learn how to be alone and to enjoy your own company. That being said it's normal to feel lonely and it's 100 percent ok to just sit in that loneliness. You don't always need to escape those feelings. Only you know what's best for you. If it's too much and you need to cut your trip early and go home then do it. I also think it's ok to ride it out and  learn how to be more accepting of it, and truly learn how to be ok with yourself. People just need to figure it out themselves. Solo travel isn't for everyone.",

You're most likely to go your separate ways with friends you make in hostels after a few days, weeks, months together. Long-term friendships can form from these travel friends you meet (and that has been known to happen), but I think that if you go on trips with the *expectation* that you'll definitely meet your new ride-or-die group, you're only setting yourself up for disappointment. Again, this *can and does* happen, but you shouldn't *expect* it to every single time. \n\nBasically, if you're struggling with social anxiety at home, being abroad won't magically cure it.",

There is a reason why social/party hostels exist. Despite it being called solo travel, many people traveling long term want to meet new people.

There's nothing wrong with relaxing vacations, but it feels as if there's been an inorganic shift towards adventurous or cultural tourism destinations and doing it solo. \n\nThis might also be a subconscious urge to seek out authentic experiences and human connection in an increasingly digital world. Europe, in particular, has also had a resurgence in popular culture, thanks to television.\n\nKeep in mind that the [stats don't necessarily bear this out though,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tourism_rankings) the top tourist destinations have been fairly consistent for some time.",

Many people are depressed &amp; feel existential about life, if they could go with friends they would have already.

            "comment": "&gt;Some people are travelling solo specifically to make friends, why?\n\nI think you're under the impression that everyone that travels alone wants to be alone. Quiet as kept, for a lot of solo travelers, it wasn't exactly a choice for them. They either don't have any friends or family or they do have friends and family but unfortunately they don't have the money to travel. So that means they have to travel by themselves but when they travel they do so with the intentions of meeting people to join them on their next trip. Nothing wrong with that. Solo traveling isn't for everyone. Although, I do wish they'd get off this sub and join a 'looking for a travel buddy' sub instead because, and I could be wrong, but I feel like the crux of this sub is for people that WANT to travel alone and spend a majority, if not all of their time, alone. \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Some people have travel/solo anxiety and are doing it, again I get throwing yourself out into the big world but I wouldn't recommend potentially causing a mental breakdown or panic attack just to be abroad.\n\nSo start small. Your first trip shouldn't be abroad if you're trying to overcome travel anxiety. It could be regional, hell even local like to the next city over. \n\n\nWhen you first learn to ride a bicycle, you start with 3 wheels than as you start to get the hang of it, you start to ride with 2. \n\n\nMe, personally, I don't see the point of letting fear ruin your life. So I'll have to disagree with you on this one and absolutely recommend it to anyone trying to overcome their anxiety.",

You can easily tag along another person or group of people, while solo travelling - the subtle line is that you're essentially not dependent on any companions, you don't make specific plans together, your journey is based on your vision and ideas and wants. None of that forbids you from inviting fellow humans to join you if they wish so or to ask if you can join them in case their plan sounds appealing to you.",

I don\u2019t think even failure is a wasted experience as long as we learn something from it.

I understand your confusion as to why I would do this since it defies the definition of solo so let me explain my rationale...\n\nIf we flip the situation and I travel with people who know me, then I have to be the person I am with them. That's not necessarily who I am. For better or worse they have made certain assumptions about who I am, what I enjoy, what I want to do.\n\nWhen I'm solo travelling I can be me. I can be multiple \"mes\". One day I can be a party person, the next day I can be shy reserved person. I can be extrovert or introvert. I have no feeling of being judged.  I have no hang ups about what others will think. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas so to speak. I have total freedom over who I am. If I meet new people along the way then they see me as I want to be seen. They see the real me. Those are my real friends.\n\nMy own friends see me as a much more reserved person than I actually am.

I just see you shitting on people who solo travel for the sake of traveling. I solo travel for the sole reason of being abroad. I feel more comfortable and at peace when I'm in Europe. My vacation times and my friends' vacation times don't always align and I'd rather be having a panic attack by myself in a villa by the sea in Greece than sitting on my ass at home watching tv for a week straight. Some of my favorite people on this planet are people I met in Iceland. With social media, it's so easy to keep in touch with those you meet along the way. It allows you to have a global perspective and take your blinders off. Some of my fondest memories are of strangers I've encountered in various corners of the globe. It reminds me that all humans are not shitty and there are really amazing people to meet that aren't within a 20 mile radius of the place I sleep most nights.",

I don't like the idea of being alone on long hikes, because I fear being only with my own inner monologue for days. Heck, even one day is sometimes too much, when one is an overthinker like me.

Lol I think everyone for sure should only do things if they genuinely want to and not to live up to anyone else\u2019s expectations. However, I think most people who choose to solo travel want to and it doesn\u2019t matter their reasons lol I\u2019m someone who loves meeting new people on my travels and it\u2019s one of my fav parts of travel. I don\u2019t expect to make long lasting friendships per say, but if someone wants to socialize and make connections on their trips, that\u2019s cool; don\u2019t think we should judge them. Also it\u2019s normal to have these lofty expectations as a young person lol it\u2019s just part of being young and having that idealistic view imo is beautiful. Reality might hit you a few times but nothing wrong with romanticizing life. If everyone was \u201crealistic\u201d 100% of the time, life would be very boring.  \n\nAnd if someone wants to solo travel to learn to be by themselves/get comfortable with it/improve their anxiety\u2026nothing wrong with that! Lol like I guess if one\u2019s mental health is particularly fragile, that\u2019s one thing, but if you have some coping skills, this is actually a great way to tackle fears. Anxiety only improves with exposure and CBT lol\n\nI just find this post weird lol like why does it matter the reasons people travel..how does it affect your travel experience",

    "postText": "From the post about India recently, I\u2019ve got some questions about getting the train in India.\n\nIn around January/February, I\u2019m planning to start my travels in Chennai, spend some time there, and then get the train to Pondicherry. It\u2019s only 4 hours which seems pretty manageable. But I\u2019ve got a few questions.\n\nHow early are reservations opened? I saw a lot of talk about making sure to book on as soon as they open to avoid general class. I feel as if I\u2019d be fine with general class but I\u2019m acutely aware that it\u2019ll not be confortable, even for just a 4 hour journey.\n\nThe other questions I\u2019ve got are about being in that region generally. How\u2019s the weather? What\u2019s the food to seek out? I\u2019m a huge cricket fan and I believe England will be touring at that time, how do I get tickets if they do end up playing in Chennai? Any must go spots or things to avoid?\n\nThank you.",

Surguru is an amazing place to try the same in Pondicherry\n\nApart from that Payyasam is one dish that I have heard of. \n\nIf you happen to visit Pondicherry do visit Delhiwalla too for food",

Most time I would be almost alone on the bench, and every time people would strike a conversation with me and give me recommendations of places to see/eat in the city.\n\nFor overnight it's better to get 2AC at least if possible and these are harder to book last minute but you can try the taktal system, extras tickets that open up at 10am 1 day before the train leaves from it's starting station.",

The drive through ECR(east coast road) is a good one.\n\nTill mid of January is the best weather than any other time. Depending on your interest you could visit some classical music concerts during that time, but this is a niche and not the usual foreign touristy thing to do.\n\nGo to the zoo see crocs, the snake park, the beaches, the temples there are a lot of things to see in chennai",

    "postText": "I travel cheap and that usually means I\u2019m on a 737 or an Airbus A320. However, I found a cheap flight on Norse that flies a 787. Obviously, it\u2019s a way nicer and larger plane. However, does that make a difference on the flight at all? The seat pitch looks to be the same, so what would actually make flying on it better?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Especially with a 787, the biggest thing you may notice is that they maintain a higher pressure and humidity in the air. Modern coach seats in general suck, so don't expect any significant step up in comfort over what you're used to.\n\nIf this is your first time on a dual-aisle plane, my favorite seats are the middle section aisles. Most 787s are 3-3-3 seats. If you as a solo flyer chooses one of those middle aisles, chances are that the other two seats are to be claimed by a couple flying together. And in that case the person in the middle will climb over the person they know to get up instead of you.",

The most notable thing was how much comfortable the seat was\u2026 leagues better than cheap airlines seats. I also appreciated the meal, the snacks (I went to the bathroom and saw a tray full of snacks. I asked if I could take one, to which a hostess replied with a smile \u201cPlease, serve yourself!). There was free wifi for whatsapp. Last but not least, as an aviation geek, I could see some basic parameters of the aircraft like windspeed, ground speed, roll angle, altitude, etc. Obviously it was also possible to watch movies/tv series",

However, getting a window seat will be harder because usually there are 9 seats per row. Other differences include higher cabin pressure and cleaner air, as air is not pumped from the engines.",

Other than that, not much different than a domestic narrowbody. The differences become a lot more apparent with business/first class where you're usually dealing with suites or lie-flat seats instead of seats that are only incrementally better than economy seats like on a short-haul configured plane.",

            "comment": "Most people get tired of it somewhere between a few months and several years. A lot also depends on personality, interests,  what you do and your mindset. If you have a plan, a project to complete it's easier to stay on the road longer. If you just do random things without any goal or purpose that tends to tire you out faster. If you  depart with the mindset to travel a certain amount of time there is an increased chance you look forward to getting home when that time has almost passed.",

I never rent cars while travelling,I don't mind what language is spoken (in fact I like non English speaking countries more,if anything).And I love walking,that is the last thing to stress me out!",

I got sick two days ago so sure it got a bit hard but overall it\u2019s a great experience! I think it also mainly depends on your travelling style. \n\nA lot of solo travellers I meet are just too excited, impatient and enthusiastic.They want to do everything, see everything and skip from one place to the other to keep checking their backpacking list. This to me is the worst mistake. There is this sort of peer pressure from one backpacker to the other that I personally don\u2019t take on me. \n\nOne advice: take the time to do things. Keep your schedule relatively flexible. You like a place? Why not stay a week there? Other people will say: you\u2019re wasting time, you should do this, this and this. \n\nThing is, that place in question will still be there in 5 or 10 years so who cares whether you visit it now or later.\n\nI think that it\u2019s definitely a beginner mistake to wanting to do everything fast. Don\u2019t forget you\u2019re on a vacation to enjoy yourself and not to fulfil someone else\u2019s bucket list or follow what others do.",

Occasionally I'll have something specific in mind that I'd quite like to do, but otherwise I'm quite happy to roam about, people watch, munch on street food if I am in a city/town/village, even better if there is access to outdoor walking trails. Being on the streets or on a trail really is my favorite part of travel.",

My flight out was booked from the beginning so as my departure date got close I was thinking about where I was going, not just where I was. That mindset change might not have happened with an open-ended trip.\n\nMy other solo trips have lasted 2-5 weeks and were also more strictly planned and often pre-booked, unlike my SEA trip which I didn\u2019t plan out ahead of time. None of them felt too long.",

I had like 3 days of \"nothing else to do\" after exhausting major attractions.\n\nSo I think it's based on the stuff you look forward to doing. \n\nMost of us would get the big targets out of the way in the first three days, so if you have 14 days to burn, that's at least 11 more days to divide the smaller attractions and the shopping/resting/indoor-because-it's-raining days.\n\nI personally haven't gone more than 14 days at a time, but this year I'll be doing a 29-night Euro trip across 7 countries in Western Europe. I'm pretty sure I would never run out of stuff to look forward to esp. since it would be my first time.",

So just negative inertia which accumulates and makes you go \u201cfuck it\u201d after x amount of times. What awaits you home is also a important.

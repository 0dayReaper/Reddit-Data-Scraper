    "postText": "Hi all! I am traveling Europe for about 11 weeks this summer before I start medical school and looking for some critiques/advice on my itinerary. Here's some context that might be helpful: \n\nI am 23 years old and my goal for this overall trip is to spend about 70% of my time exploring cities and absorbing culture and 30% of my time relaxing on the beach or doing outdoorsy activities (eg. hikes). I wouldn't necessarily say I'm on a tight budget but I would like to avoid unnecessary costs and won't be going to fancy restaurants or anything. I'm willing to spend money on experiences but I'm not a shopper, though I do love thrifting and exploring markets. I'm a quiet person so need some cities where I can just keep to myself but would like a mix of socializing and making friends to go out with too in some cities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I know my itinerary definitely has too much so please don't be sassy in the comments. I'm just looking for advice on which cities aren't worth it and should be cut so I'm not spending so much time traveling!** Also open to suggestions for replacements if there's a better city I should be visiting. I know Croatia makes the least sense in this itinerary so if need be, I'm willing to cut it but I'll be pretty sad because I've heard great things. I generally like to find a happy medium between moving too quickly and spending too much time in one place. I was in Europe last winter (albeit only for 3 weeks so I know I'll get more tired this time) and I felt pretty bored being in Amsterdam for 5 days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJune 5-8: Porto (can't be changed)\n\nJune 8-12: Lisbon\n\nJune 12-14: Lagos\n\nJune 14-16: Faros\n\nJune 16-19: Seville\n\nJune 19-21: Granada\n\nJune 21-23: Valencia\n\nJune 23-28: Barcelona\n\nJune 28-30: Tolouse\n\nJune 30-July 3: Bordeaux\n\nJuly 3-8: Paris\n\nJuly 8-11: Strasbourg\n\nJuly 11-13: Lucerne\n\nJuly 13-16: Interlaken\n\nJuly 16-17: Lyon\n\nJuly 17-18: Arles\n\nJuly 18-20: Nice (fly to Split)\n\nJuly 20-24: Split\n\nJuly 24-29: Zagreb\n\nJuly 29-Aug 1: Venice\n\nAug 1-3: Bergamo\n\nAug 3-5: Lake Como\n\nAug 5-7: Turin\n\nAug 7-9: Cinque de Terre\n\nAug 9-11: Pisa\n\nAug 11-16: Florence\n\nAug 16-19: Sorrento (can't be changed, meeting friends)\n\nAug 20-22: Rome (can't be changed, meeting friends)",

I was there just a month ago for a full day and I felt like I've seen everything. I would rather divide that time to better areas like Plitvice, perhaps even spend one day in Zadar.\n\nFor Split, again the city is nice for 1 day but unless you take daytrips to places outside city like Trogir/Sibenik/Hvar/Krka then it's not really worth 4 days.\n\n&gt;Aug 9-11: Pisa\r  \n\r  \nAug 11-16: Florence\n\nFor Pisa, you can basically see everything it offers in a half daytrip from Florence. I would not spend 2 nights in Pisa. You could add the Pisa daytrip to your Florence stay. \n\nAs for Florence, I think 2-3 days is already enough. Make sure you have some daytrips planned to Pisa/Lucca/Siena.",

Happy travels. :)",

            "comment": "Let me echo the other two comments that are already here \u2014 there\u2019s really no reason to stay in Pisa at all. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to do there except see the Leaning Tower and the church/baptistery next to it. You can easily do that in half a day from Florence. \n\nI would try to maximize your time in Florence. I think it\u2019s utterly enchanting, and it\u2019s very centrally located. The trains in Italy are excellent, you can take a number of day trips from there. Bologna is literally about 40 minutes away on the high speed train, and I would be sure to check out Siena, it has a totally different and more medieval feel than many other cities. \n\nAnd when you\u2019re in Sorrento, be sure to visit Naples, it\u2019s wild. It feels like a totally different country. Don\u2019t forget, Pompeii is nearby too!",

            "comment": "I think it would take me about 3 years to plan an 11 week trip. Have you done any research on these places? You need to take each one, Google it and figure out what you'd like to do in each city and how many days you need for each. People have different tastes as well.\n\nFor me, Zagreb was a place to spend a night on the way from Slovenia to Plitvice and Zadar. Think I arrived around 10pm and left around 6am. Venice was somewhere I found one day more than enough. Interlaken was a place to change trains on the way to Lauterbrunnen. Pisa two hours was enough. Bergamo was an airport transfer city to Milan.\n\nYou are going to Switzerland but skipping Zermatt, which was the highlight for me. Going to Croatia but skipping Dubrovnik. Do you need to spend so much time in France and Spain? Other than Barcelona, mainland Spain never appealed to me that much. Strasbourg and Lyon don't come across as time well spent either.\n\nMy suggestion: Rethink the number of days in some of these and fit in Zermatt and Bern in Switzerland, stay in Lauterbrunnen instead of Interlaken. Instead of questioning going to Croatia, allocate more days to that part of Europe and spend a bit time in Slovenia and Montenegro as well. Lake Bled (Slovenia) and Kotor (Montenegro) are gorgeous. Skip Zagreb. Maybe a day if you must see it.",

            "comment": "Going with what the others have said:\nI\u2019d suggest seeing the sea in Croatia rather than staying in the mainland in Zagreb for so long, there\u2019s a lot of campsites on the seaside if you want to save a bit, the northern you go on the coast the less touristy they get.\nToo many days in Venice imo, 2 or 3 maximum would be enough. Same goes for Bergamo, you would only want to be there if you\u2019re planning on going to Milan each day without spending much on accommodation in that city.\nI\u2019d cut one or two days from Florence and Pisa and add them to Cinque Terre, which would be the perfect place to relax in between your trip, and maybe add some other day trips like Bologna and Matera",

            "comment": "I think your itinerary looks good, though you will be exhausted moving around so much. I get it, you want to see as much as you can and I don't blame you.  \n\nJust some minor tweeks I would make based on my own experience in some of these places.\n\n1. I would take the 2-3 days you have for Pisa and add them to Sorrento instead. This will give you more time to explore the stunning Amalfi Coast and do day trips to Naples, Pompeii, Herculaneum, Capri, and more. There is A LOT to see in this area.\n2. Use one of your days in Seville to take a day trip to Cordoba. Just 40 mins by train. I spent 3 days in Seville and was bored by the third day. Teatro de Triana for a flamenco show. \n3. Shave a day off Venice and add it to Florence. Florence itself is worth 3 days, but there are so many day trip options that you could easily spend a week. Two days in Venice was plenty for me. \n4. What is in Toulouse? Unless there is something of particular interest, I'd skip it and maybe stop in Andorra or even Bilboa or San Sebastian en route to Bordeaux from Barcelona.\n5. Completely eliminate Zagreb and add Dubrovnik and Kotor. Or add Slovenia, which would make sense if you're going towards Venice from Split. \n6. If it's your first time in Rome, I would try really  hard to add at least another day or two. There's so much to see. But it's going to be brutally hot there in August.\n\nThis looks like it's going to be an epic trip for you, so enjoy it before you settle into med school!",

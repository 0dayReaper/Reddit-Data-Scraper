    "postText": "I feel like I\u2019ve read a lot of contradicting info on this and I\u2019d like some clarification. I\u2019m flying into Lima on the 11th, and leaving for Ica on the morning of the 13th. I\u2019ll stay in Ica/Huacachina until the 15th before heading to Cusco. If I\u2019d like to do a day trip to Machu Pichu in the 17th-21st range, when do I need to arrange that? Is it better to book in advance with a tour company or wait until I get to Cusco? Will I need a separate ticket to Machu Pichu ir should that be included in price?",

These tickets are highly limited and tend to sell out in advance.\n\n&gt; Will I need a separate ticket to Machu Pichu ir should that be included in price?\n\nIf you're not doing a trek in on foot, you'll want to book a ticket to Aguas Calientes, the nearby town. I used [Peru Rail](https://www.perurail.com/) but there might be better options.",

I think I booked mine several months in advance but I'd imagine a few weeks is probably fine? I'd book that now. I seem to recall a bunch of disappointed people who didn't realize they had to book it in advance and didn't get to see it.",

            "comment": "I just went last week and booked the day before fine. Getting in early doesn\u2019t matter for how much time you have, since everyone is limited to I think 2 hours. Some parts of it are only available from around 9-11 AM though, so that would be a reason to book early. I bought tickets there at 8 AM but the 9 AM entrance was sold out and I wasn\u2019t able to go up until 11. This was for the day trip. \n\nI did do a tour, which I enjoyed. If it matters to you, the tour guides are really efficient with finding and taking really nice pics for you, and honestly that was worth it alone for all the great shots I now have with my dad.",

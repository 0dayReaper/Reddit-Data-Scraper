    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nI am landing in Manila Friday evening and have the weekend before needing to be in Batangas Monday morning.  I have traveled to the Philippines a few times pre pandemic but have not been since 2018.\n\nI'd like to ask for advice on options/suggestions for recommendations of a bachelor party like weekend itinerary for the weekend and if anyone could recommend specific places that are open as I heard many places shutdown during the pandemic like Air force one.\n\nMy current plans are to stay in Manila Friday night and then take a roro to sabang Saturday and come back to batangas Monday morning but open to other ideas.  I am looking for places where I can meet women/ party,  enjoy some executions/beach and get a few massages.\n\nThank you",

Like are the bars open all night and is it crowded and lively during the middle of the week?",

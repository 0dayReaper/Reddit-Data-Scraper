    "postText": "Hi Guys, I live in London and have too much holiday to use so decided to go away next weekend to try and escape the London heat. Ideally I'd like to spend those days on a nice sandy beach but I also like roaming around cities, enjoying beautiful architecture (not a must), partying, and meeting people around my age (I'm M25). As I'm only staying for a couple of days I don't want to spend too much. Ideally in the region of \u00a3300-400 but this is not strict at all. \nI'll also be going solo so l'm trying to take this into account.. as much as I want to relax, I would prefer to be able to meet people my age and other solo travelers. I\u2019m also considering good transport links since I won\u2019t be able to rent a car. For example I have Ibiza on my list but heard that a car will probably be needed to move around.. but if someone can confirm this from experience that would be great!\n\nI've visited Spain 3 times before but only been to Barcelona so was keen on going somewhere else this time. What do you think is a must visit beach destination in Spain that would meet the above criteria?\nPlaces I'm considering (open to other suggestions):\nSpain: -Ibiza(Formentera) - Valencia -Malaga - Lloret de Mar (Costa Brava)\nOpen to suggestions in Portugal- but heard that the water might be a bit cold this time of year in Portugal.. if anyone can confirm that would be great as well! Does Lagos meet the criteria above?\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Hi mate. Valencia or Malaga would both fit the criteria well. They're on the beach much like Barcelona is so transport is very easy. Malaga is a nice shout as you could take a day/night and see Granada, Cordoba or Seville, all of which are well worth your time.\n Lisbon is a fantastic option too. It's a great city, easy to get to nice beaches by train, and lots to see and do. The south coast of Portugal didn't do it for me. There's a lot of Brits there and you can feel it a bit. It's perhaps less culturally interesting too as you're away from the big city. If you're not bothered by those things then it'll work well for you. The sea in Portugal is very cold right now though, especially compared to further into the Med.",

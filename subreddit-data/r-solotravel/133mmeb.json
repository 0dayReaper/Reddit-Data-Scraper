I realized it was poor planning on my part not to pursue something that excites me more (like a multi-day hiking excursion or at least going up to Scotland).\nAnyone else every get stuck in the shoulda-couldas? \nHow do you actually accept \"well I'm here now. Let's stay in the moment and make the most of it.\" Any other sage words or similar experiences to help a grumpy, regretful traveler?\n\nUpdate: Thanks for the encouragement, everyone! While it wasn't cheap, I decided my time and experience more valuable than sticking around for a car rental/cheaper train. \nThe overall consensus was the enjoy the moment and finding meaning where you're at - but, when you can change your location, don't be afraid to do so!",

I jumped on a train to Monaco and spent the rest of my trip there &amp; in Nice. Absolutely loved the remainder of my trip. \n\nIf you're able to alter your plans, then go for it.\n\nEdit: if you're looking for charm and also places to hike, I highly recommend the North York Moors - specifically, Knaresborough, Harrogate, Ilkley. On the door step of god's country, and also along the way to Scotland if that's where you end up. Equally, Cumbria is beautiful and a great place to hike - also has charming towns and villages.",

There was plenty of other solo travellers around too - especially in Monaco.\n\nI don't think eating alone is too much an issue (although I get it can be awkward lol) Personally, I like to journal when travelling - but you could always take a book. In Nice particularly I found the waiters enjoyed chatting with people who were sat alone including me. I didn't mind having a good chat with them either.\n\nAs for activities, I'm personally more of an explorer. I like wondering around and taking in the architecture and people watching. Nice has a great castle to climb up to, and some great back streets. Plenty of restaurants too, of course.\n\nMonaco has its palace, but also an exceptional oceanarium you could visit. There's some lovely quant bakeries / cafes on \"The Rock of Monaco\" (The old part of Monaco), too. I can't remember the name, but one of those bakeries serves the best croissants I've ever had (Sorry, France).\n\nPlenty to do! The trains are fairly good around that part of France too, so always a day trip or two a solo traveler can do. Monaco and Nice are ~30 minutes on the train from each other. So you'd want to stay in one and day trip to the other imo.",

The main draws for me in Scotland are the Isle of Skye, Glenfinnan Viaduct, and Culloden, and ofc just a general tour of the Highlands to see the landscape. I'm also interested in historical sites, like the castles in Edinburgh and Stirling. Are you open to booking a day tour? Main departure points are Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Inverness. Many day tours will cover these sites. I've got one planned out of Edinburgh and another planned out of Inverness.\n\nRegarding England, I started in the south and traveled through several cities before making it up north to York. Beyond London, I didn't enjoy the south tbh. I liked Cambridge a lot but it wasn't until Manchester and my day tour out to Derbyshire that I felt I was really enjoying what England has to offer.\n\nI'd say Winchester was my biggest mistake, but I wouldn't have known that unless I had gone there. Like other commenters have said, there will be positive and negative aspects to any trip. I travel to learn about myself as much as any place I might visit. Maybe try to reframe it by asking yourself what you have learned about yourself from this trip. It doesn't even have to be that deep. Sometimes we just learn how to better plan our next trip.",

Lovely architecture and some great pubs. I lived in Bath for 3 years and absolutely love the place.\n\nFrom there you could head to Bristol and then on to Chepstow and the Wye Valley, just over the border in Wales. Chepstow Castle and Tintern Abbey are both very much worth a visit and the Wye Valley scenery is beautiful. \n\nFrom there, Wales is there to be explored! As people have said the Brecon Beacons are quite beautiful, with hills and waterfalls, and a few nice little towns like Crickhowell and Hay-on-Wye (famous for its bookshops). From Hay, having a car means you could drive over the Gospel Pass in the Black Mountains (the highest road pass in England and Wales, with quite spectacular scenery and wild ponies) into the Vale of Ewyas and visit the ruined Llanthony Priory. There are also lots of castles in this general area - White Castle, Grosmont etc. \n\nFrom there you could head west to the Gower and Pembrokeshire, or north to explore Snowdonia and the amazing castles of North Wales (Caernarfon, Conwy, Beaumaris, Harlech etc).",

If you're excited to go, don't let my experience stop you. \n\nI will say that the culture is built around groups, and I found it difficult to find restaurant seating for one -- some places refuse to allow a table for solo guests; some will tell you their reservations are full, even with a mostly empty place. I encountered a lot of impatience in my attempts to converse in Spanish, and surprisingly few knew English as well as I know Spanish. These combined to make me feel more isolated than I ever have in decades of solo travel. My least favorite trip. (I've been to notoriously rude Paris and NYC several times, and found most were not at all.)\n\nThat being said, I'm still glad I went because I met some amazing *tourists* there, and enjoyed the beauty of the cities. Good luck!",

I consider that entirely worthwhile, even though I also didn\u2019t find the place all that friendly. For me, it was a very youth culture city and I am past that age. The food experiences I had there were also wonderful. From tapas to my first taste of Russian salad. One of my favorite restaurant experiences worldwide was a small Nepalese place a couple of blocks up the hill from la Sagrada. Two little tables outside. No problem getting seating for one. So lots of great memories.",

They are stunning, and particularly interesting if you are into history and architecture. \n\nI don\u2019t know of a soul who doesn\u2019t love Edinburgh and I personally never fail to make friends the moment I set foot in Scotland. Be warned it can be horribly cold that far north in early spring though. \n\nI second the recommendation of Wales. The scenery is stunning. If you\u2019re out of miles on your car rental, there are some awesome views to be enjoyed there from the trains. \n\nAnd of course London has got so much to offer for anyone.",

Then I just try to enjoy the time that I\u2019m there. But I\u2019m also a huge optimist and have a positive view on just about everything so even when I\u2019m in a \u201cboring\u201d place I think about how nice it is to be there to break up all the times I\u2019m in exciting cool places. I had a stint recently of Vienna-Barcelona-Brussels-Tirana-Istanbul-Seoul-Tokyo-Kyoto and I intentionally booked Tirana in the middle of it because it\u2019s not as touristy and busy as all of those other cities. Sure, I was hanging out in my apartment more than normal, but I enjoyed the break of not having to explore every day of the week. If you\u2019re moving frequently enough you find the ebb and flow to be kind of nice. That\u2019s my experience anyway.",

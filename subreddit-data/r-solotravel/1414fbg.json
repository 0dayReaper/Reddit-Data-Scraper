I\u2019m not super familiar with locations so please let me know if distances and travel between locations are a big issue here. \n\n\nThings I want to see:\n\n-\tAs many volcanoes as possible, ideally Mt. Merapi, Bromo, and Ijen (open to other suggestions.\n\n-\tGreat Indonesian Coffee\n\n-\tBorobudur and Prambanan temples \n\n-\tOrangutans in Kalimantan or somewhere else + as many monkeys as possible (other national park suggestions?)\n\n-\tKomodo Dragons in Komodo National Park\n\n-\tNeed to stay in Bali for 2 days to meet up with a tattoo artist, but otherwise not a priority\n\n\nThings I\u2019m not as interested in:\n\n-\tSurfing, Diving, Parties, Beaches would be great but also not a top priority.\n\n\nI\u2019m open to any and all suggestions, and please tell me if all of this is way too ambitious for 3 weeks (and what I could leave out).\n\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Volcanoes - Merapi will be visible from Yogyakarta on most days, and if you visit Setumbu Hill viewpoint near Borobudur at sunrise, you can get the classic \u2018Nirwana\u2019 view of the volcano as well. Bromo is also best done at sunrise, so either base yourself at the crater side village of Cemoro Lawang or take a midnight trip in from Surabaya (Probolinggo is an option too but it\u2019s a grubby place that\u2019s neither Surabaya nor Cemoro). Haven\u2019t been to Ijen but heard it\u2019s a great hiking trip. In other volcanoes, consider hiking up Rinjani in Lombok, and Kelimutu in Flores (from Labuan Bajo / Komodo). Also, if you travel by train on Java (and you should, it\u2019s cheap and comfortable and not too slow), you\u2019ll cross a volcano every half an hour. Even if you fly around, take a window seat, you\u2019ll lose track of how many craters you fly over.\n\nCoffee - there are some great coffee estates in Central Java, but unless you stay at them, expect to be shunted through somewhat disappointing tours. I\u2019d rather find a nice coffee shop in a city and try their brews - Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Surabaya will all have them, as will Bali.\n\nBorobudur and Prambanan are easiest done from Yogyakarta, though if you can spend a night in the countryside around Borobudur, do it - it\u2019s quite pretty and there\u2019s lots of lovely homestays and small hotels around.\n\nNo advice on Orangutans in Kalimantan, but budget a week atleast given that you\u2019ll have to fly in and figure a boat tour into the rainforest and tribal reserves. Balikpapan and Pontianak would be the most accessible places to start.\n\nKomodo is best done from Labuan Bajo, the nearest harbour and airport town. A join-in day cruise will show you most spots (and what spots!) but if you can, consider a liveaboard to see even quieter corners of the area. The seascape here is surreal.\n\nBali is actually a lot more nice than you\u2019d think. Yes it\u2019s got it\u2019s crowded bits, but it\u2019s a large island with enough beautiful corners. Besides, after some roughing it in Indo\u2019s remote corners, the creature comforts of Bali are a godsend - you don\u2019t have to party or surf here, you can just enjoy great hotels and food while visiting some really beautiful temples and highland scenery. I\u2019d also highly recommend the trip out to Nusa Penida (stay overnight if you want to avoid the day tour crowds, the beaches and cliffs are well worth it).\n\nFor my trip in 2019, I took two weeks to travel from Jakarta to Bali via Yogyakarta (Borobudur and Prambanan), Surabaya (Bromo), and Labuan Baji (Komodo). I used trains from Jakarta to Yogyakarta to Surabaya, and then flights from Surabaya to Labuan Bajo to Denpasar. This routing worked well for me since the best connections in and out of Indo for me were either from Denpasar or from Jakarta.\n\nYou could work with the same itinerary, adding some more time around Surabaya to hike up to Ijen, and a few more days in Komodo. Since you are visiting Bali anyway, I\u2019d recommend you give it a second thought - it\u2019s a lovely place with something for every kind of visitor. Otherwise, consider stopping off at Lombok for Rinjani on your way back from Komodo. Kalimantan is a separate latch on, so you could do it either in the beginning from Jakarta, or towards the end from Bali. Malaysia is good for Orangutan tracking as well, if you\u2019re okay leaving that bit out to another trip - the rest of your Indonesia journey will anyway have more than enough for you to pick and choose from.",

I\u2019m going to research all those spots you mentioned. \n\nI think I will definitely try to spend some more time in Bali and try not to be too deterred by the idea I had of it in my head (it\u2019s a super popular tourist destination from my country, and I think I just felt like seeing something different. But I will give it a chance and maybe spend a bit longer than I planned. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of skipping Komodo and instead spending that extra time in Kalimantan.\n\nWhat do you think about starting in Bali, and working my way west, before flying from Yogyakarta to Kalimantan, and ending the trip with the orangutans?",

Kalimantan\u2019s cities don\u2019t have many international connections, so unless you\u2019re from Singapore or Malaysia, you will probably need to backtrack to Jakarta/Bali before heading back home.\n\nLogistically, it makes sense to do Kalimantan right after Bali. You could then fly to Surabaya and work your way across Java overland, finally flying out from Jakarta. Most airlines will offer equally priced deals for these open jaw tickets (in to one city, out of another, but on the same airline).\n\nAlternatively, you could split your time in Bali - a few days on either side of the Kalimantan+Java legs. \n\nI haven\u2019t been to Kalimantan, so cannot comment on how worthwhile it is, but Komodo is definitely very beautiful. I wouldn\u2019t miss it if I\u2019m going to Indonesia and have the time to include it in my trip.  You can still find Orangutans in other places, but you\u2019ll only find the dragons in Komodo, and the island landscape is one of a kind as well.",

From Bali you can easily go to Lombok to see Komodo dragons and the national park. \nAfter that, you can continue your trip to Java. You can have some hiking trips to some volcanoes along the way (Also check Mt. Semeru, might be interesting to you). \n\nIncluding Kalimantan in this trip is gonna be tricky since Kalimantan is quite far away from the places you want to visit (mostly in Java). I would recommend not to include Kalimantan in this trip. It is a big island and lots of interesting things to explore as well. P.S. In Bali, there are also some temples with lots of monkeys in it.",

I'd say start in Jakarta, take the direct flight from Jakarta to Pangkalan Bun (PKN) in Borneo from where you can do a 2.5 day tour of Tanjung Puting National Park to see Orangutans. I'd say go with Jenie Subaru, excellent organization of the tour. On the way back you can fly from PKN to Bali via Surabaya and then continue on with the rest of your trip.",

    "postText": "I would be entering Germany for work immediately following a 30 day backpacking trip throughout other European countries. \n\nI have heard that it can take just a few weeks to process a visa if I go to a German embassy and submit my information in person.     \n\nI\u2019ve been told that normally I could get this done efficiently at the Foreigners Authority after arriving in Germany, but due to the influx of refugees it could take up to half a year if I tried to do it that way.     \n\nIt was recommended I try to get an appointment at a German embassy in a different country. When I check the websites of Toronto, Prague, Warsaw, London, Paris, and Budapest, to book an appointment with their German Embassies, I get the same message \u201cUnfortunately, there are no appointments available at this time. New appointments will be made available for booking at regular intervals.\u201d    \n\nIt seems that I can\u2019t schedule an appointment with any German embassy in the word for at least 2 months. I can\u2019t access their calendars beyond June.  Could this be a glitch the the website?   Are there any other, faster ways to obtain a Youth Mobility visa?     \n\nIf not, are there any other countries with faster, easier work visa processing in Europe?     \n\nI know this is a lot. I\u2019m pretty stressed out about all this. Seems way more complicated than it needs to be.    \n\nI would truly appreciate some help with this.     \n\nThanks!",

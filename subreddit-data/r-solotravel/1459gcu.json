    "postText": "29F - wanted to see if anyone had any insights regarding how safe the O circuit is to do by yourself. I\u2019ll be there in late November and plan on having all of my accommodations booked with one of the recommended companies trekking packages. My concern is going from point A to point B each day - as I might be alone? I know the W circuit will have people but am concerned parts of the O will be quieter. Does anyone have any experience or recommendations with the O circuit? Is it risky for me to travel during the day by myself?",

            "comment": "I did the O circuit back in 2018. What risk are you worried about? Weather? Getting lost? Animals? Other humans? Injury?\n\nThe short answer is that it's totally safe to do solo, at least as safe as an trekking route. \n\nIt's worth having an offline map like [maps.me](https://maps.me) for navigation. The only major exposure risk is around the John Garner Pass as you head towards Grey Glacier, but if the situation is extreme, the rangers at Los Perros or wherever will either not let you go, or ensure you leave early to beat inclement danger.  \n\nWith respect to injury, it's quieter than the W, which simply means it's not overflowing or flooded with people. You will absolutely see people on trail each day, every day.",

Didn\u2019t do the circuit but did a short day hike, in November 2022 , with snow flurries and winds that meant you had to bend over to hike and not get knocked down. Enjoyed talking with all the trekkers who had just completed the circuit. Punta Natales is did I say? \u2026.always very very windy due to the topography. I stayed at Kootee\u2019s(yes her name) Place, a small hostel/ABB clean and modern, even the shared baths. It included a varied breakfast and most important, HEAT. It works out better to buy your in country flights ahead of time. I used SKY but I spent 3X as much buying in Chile, closer to my in country flights, as opposed to a month beforehand, from the US. The Zoo and National Park in Santiago are phenomenal. The air tram gives a birds eye view of Santiago. Enjoy.",

Not sure if things have changed but you could only camp in designated spots so everyone wound up at the same place for the most part.  It was pretty popular back then so I can only imagine what it is like now but you would always pass and see people on the trail.  Like someone else mentioned the pass could be dangerous but when I did it everyone at the campsite decided to leave at the same time and do it together.",

            "comment": "I did it solo(M) last December, but there were at least 3 solo female hikers in my cohort of O trekkers.  Most people start roughly around the same time +/- 1 hour due to the breakfast and checkout times. So you generally hike and meet the same people every day depending on your pace. Even on the first day, people were mingling and hiking towards the first campsite.\n\nI was able to befriend quite a few trail buddies O side. It was a lot more easier as the hikes are generally shorter and more time to lounge around the campgrounds.\n\nThe weather is the biggest concern and just prepare for the worst. I went through a snow squall up paso el garner and had to deal with super windy days on the W side of the park.",

Since then I've Air BNB'd in Kyoto and Rome and I've done cruises alone. And I drove my 24\" rv...but never alone.  This trip was something new.\nAdvice?  Try to break up your drive with plenty of stops, drive in daylight as much as you can, know how to use your GPS, drive through big cities like LA around noon when traffic is light.  And have a car you feel you can rely on.\nI know I'm lucky.  I take no meds and can easily walk 10+ miles.  Yeah, I think life goes faster the older you get.  I just want to be able to keep moving, seeing the world, meeting people, learning new stuff.\nGetting out of your comfort zone has rewards.",

Over the past year end-stage emphysema has rendered him housebound. So after almost 45 years of marriage, I no longer have my favorite travel buddy. \nI have managed a little trip by myself each of the past three years to visit out of state friends. I\u2019m so afraid to travel on my own\u2014solely because I\u2019m a woman. \nAt 65 I\u2019m thankfully healthy &amp; want to travel while I can. Please share safety tips to ease my discomfort about going to places where I\u2019d know no one.",

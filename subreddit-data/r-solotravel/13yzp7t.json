I can't drive (and don't have the ability to get a license until 2 years from now, give or take) but I still want to visit soon. So I want to see if it's viable/worth it to go without renting a vehicle, or if I should save it for after I have a license.",

I\u2019ve never been to YT, but I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s got an amazing transit system. Whitehorse might have decent transit as the territorial capital, but the rest of the territory is pretty sparse.\n\nUnfortunately a lot of Canada is very hard to navigate without a car.",

It\u2019s huge and relatively empty, so don\u2019t expect there to be buses darting all over the place. Even Whitehorse - population of 25,000 - will have terrible transit. \n\nAnd the parts actually worth visiting will be significantly more remote. You need to drive if this is going to be anything more than a self-imposed \u201ccan I get around the Yukon without a car\u201d challenge.",

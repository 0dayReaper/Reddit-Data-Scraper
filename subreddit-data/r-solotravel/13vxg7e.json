    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019m currently in my first 2 weeks of a 3 month Europe trip and by some stroke of bad luck have been some form of unwell for the whole time. At first I could deal with it because my symptoms were so minor (fatigue, sore throat), but at the moment I\u2019ve got both a sinus infection that\u2019s giving me really rough headaches, and diarrhoea and nausea. I\u2019ve been trying to stay positive and take care of myself, but it\u2019s honestly tainted all my memories of the last few weeks. \n\nI\u2019d love to be able to take a few days off and just rest, but I\u2019m moving cities every 2-3 days (I normally enjoy the fast pace and want to see as much as possible, as I won\u2019t be able to come back for a few years), and hate feeling like I\u2019m missing out on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be in this particular city and see it\u2019s attractions. \n\nI haven\u2019t been able to make friends in hostels because I\u2019ve been feeling so tired and didn\u2019t want to spread whatever it is I\u2019ve got, and I\u2019m just really really gutted. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? I\u2019ve never been sick while travelling and thought I could power through but I\u2019m struggling :(\n\nUpdate: cancelling all my plans for the next 3 days and found a private room to stay in! \nSuper bummed to be missing out on some really cool cities but I know it\u2019ll be worth it when I can experience the rest of my trip to it\u2019s fullest extent.",

            "comment": "I think resisting the urge to \"power through\" will be better for your recovery. I'd advise finding somewhere nice-ish to stay where you have a room to yourself, and just taking it easy for a few days, at least until the GI symptoms settle down. If budget permits and your stomach can handle it, you could use the local Uber Eats equivalent to still sample some food from local restaurants, and watch some movies from the country you're visiting, so you can at least try to stay somewhat connected to the place you're visiting.",

But unless you're dying anytime soon or the city is sinking, there is a good possibility to come back!\n\nIt sucks to miss stops, but sometimes it helps for me to remember that I can come back, even if it takes me years or decades to do so. You're only in the first 2 weeks and you still have many weeks to go, so powering through doesn't seem realistic to me. I'll only power through if I only have a couple of days left, but attempting to power through for 2,5 months might just mean you're gonna stay (partly) sick for 2,5 months and you might only get sicker.\n\n\nEdit: I got sick in the first half of a 2 month asia trip (actually was supposed to be 3 months but covid happened). Even though I had to reroute my whole trip and skip whole countries because I wasn't feeling well enough to travel and had to stay in places with good hospitals, when I look back at the trip I don't just remember the sick times but mainly remember the good times I had. This was more than 3 years ago and next year I'm hoping to go back to see the countries I missed last time",

I could move all my limbs but at one point I couldn't squeeze toothpaste.\n\nI was lucky the doctor at the hospital in Chile had studied it in the US and tried out a new (at the time) therapy.  Spent the 10 days in the hospital undergoing IVIG.  So by the time I left the hospital I was able to take a few steps holding onto things.  Two days after I got back home I went out dancing (with a cane)...  Recovery was slow though, I couldn't run or jump very well for almost a year.  I'm 100% recovered now though luckily.\n\nThis was in the late 1990s, pre cell phone and wifi days.  I was supposed to travel with an Aussie girl I'd never met other than via an online forum.  Luckily she'd given me the contact of a friend there, was able to get in touch with her and she came to visit me in the hospital.",

Give it a couple of days and see how you feel, then take it from there.\n\nWay back, on a trip with friends, I caught something mid-way on a 10-day trip where we were also moving every couple of days. I didn't have the benefit of picking my own shots because I couldn't hold the others back, so I had to keep travelling, and it was miserable. On peak illness day I was just exhausted and didn't enjoy a single moment of the town we were in (which is a shame, because in retrospect, it was a lovely place), but I did head to the local pharmacy and they fixed me up with something that got me back on track in just a couple of days. Had I been able to rest at least one full day, I would have been back to 100% even faster.",

It\u2019s sucks so much to feel like you\u2019re missing out, but it\u2019s better to lose a few days to rest than to run yourself into the ground and end up missing even more.

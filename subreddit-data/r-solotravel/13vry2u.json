    "postText": "Thought I would do a trip report for once! I traveled to NoCal area from May 7th to May 15th. I live in America (Pittsburgh) and have not been to the West Coast other than when I was a preteen, so I decided it was time to go explore. I am 26F for context. \n\nMay 6th - Flew into JFK, my flight was delayed on the tarmac in Pit, and I only had a 1.5 hour layover. I managed to make my second flight as the doors were closing. PHEWF. Landed in SF around 12:30. I had left my apartment at 2:30 AM EST so I already had been traveling for 12 hours at that point LOL. I then picked up my rental car, drove another 4 hours towards Yosemite. Stopped along the way and did some hikes and site seeing. Got to my airbnb, got dinner and just had a campfire that night. My airbnb was in the Sierra National Forest. It was just beautiful there! \n\nDay 2 : Spent time exploring local hikes in the area. I was near Oakhurst/North Forks. Went to Bass Lake. Went back to my airbnb (which was a cute AF airstream camper) and grilled for dinner and read a book. Very relaxing day. \n\nDay 2 : Went to San Joaquin recreation area and did a hike there. Saw so many wildflowers... like 20 different types. And so many cows. Very little people on the trails, it was beautiful! The river was raging. \n\nDay 3: Yosemite day! It was about a 1 hour drive to the gate, then another hour drive to the Valley. Left around 6am, was at the Valley by 9 AM (stopping and taking my time getting there once again LOL). Got some coffee at the cafe, and then set off for hiking. I did the lower Yosemite Falls trail and the upper Yosemite falls trail. Was a super steep hike, there was still snow on the trail! Yosemite was just gorgeous. I seemingly got lucky as well, because the park was closed the week before, and the weather was calling for it to be 30 degrees, but it was 50. The park was not crowded AT ALL when I was there. \n\nDay 4 : Another travel day! Hit up a few wineries on my drive back towards SF and got to Pacifica around 5ish? Got dinner at the beach taco bell (had to, it is so iconic) and watched the sunset (glad I did, it was the only sunset that wasn't foggy!!!) \n\nDay 5: Decided to roadtrip down to Big Sur and stop along the way! Stopped in Half Moon Bay, did some walking and shopping, stopped along the coast multiple times to site see, hung out near Bixby Bridge for a bit, turned around and met up with an old friend in Santa Cruz and had dinner on the beach and watched the sunset with her!\n\nDay 6 : Tried to go see the Golden Gate Bridge at Bakers Beach but it was foggy af, so I just walked on the beach and people watched for like 45 mins, then took off towards Muir Woods. I stopped at the Golden Gate Bridge view as it was not foggy across the bridge, and got to see it! Then I drove up to Muir Woods to see the redwoods! Hiked around for a bit, but my knee was bothering me a bit that day, so I didn't do any long hikes. More just sketched and took pictures on my polaroid. \n\nDay 7: Time to go into SF Proper. I parked at a BART Station, took the BART in, got brunch at a super cute place near the BART stop, and used MUNI for the rest of the day. I went to DeYoung Museum after, which was amazing. Loved both of their special exhibits. There was a public concert going on, so I hung out there for a bit and watched. Then I went to the Japanese Tea Gardens. Very cute in there. Lots of blooming flowers and plants. After, walked through Golden Gate park to Haigh-Ashbury and did some windowshopping at vintage stores, and came across a local artist market. Went and saw the Painted ladies. Took a bus to dinner, and headed out after that as it was 7pm and I wanted to get back to my car before dark!\n\nDay 8: Travel day! My flight wasn't until noon, so I hung out on the beach in the morning and watched the surfers. Traveled home, no delayed flights. Got in around 1/2am to Pittsburgh. \n\nOverall, it was a great trip! I was very impressed by California, it was just beautiful. I never felt unsafe, as many people warned me that SF was \"gross, unsafe, dirty\". I didn't share those sentiments at all. It is upsetting to see poverty and income discrepancy, for sure, but I did not have any negative experiences regarding that. It was cold, but I was expecting the weather. I honestly overpacked warm cloths, as Yosemite was calling for 30ish weather, but it ended up being 50! \n\nVery happy I chose this area as my first Cali experience!",

I don't ever spend much time in SF itself but I agree that I have never felt unsafe or harassed. I think a lot of people that don't deal with unhoused people often just assume that they are dangerous when I have rarely found that to be fact. \n\nBtw, Pittsburgh is one of my favorite off-beat places to visit. The arts and food scenes there are fantastic!",

Additionally, while working in a California shelter for those who were both mentally ill and recovering from substance addiction, I learned that much of California\u2019s homeless population originated elsewhere. Word of mouth is that it\u2019s better to be homeless there than elsewhere in the US. \n\nOn top of that, some towns still have programs where they buy their homeless residents a one-way ticket to SF or LA. It was disconcerting to realize that when a patient would tell me that they didn\u2019t know the local area, it wasn\u2019t from mental illness.",

    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI 22F am from Belgium looking to travel to the US and Canada for about 1.5 months. I have some friends and family in the US but canada is my main goal. I would take this trip in August. I would like to take an overnight train from DC to Chicago because had a friend who has done it before but I don\u2019t know how possible this may be. I would also like to know if any of you have stayed in hostels in Chicago as that is the main place I am struggling with finding somewhere to stay. \n\nStart in NYC (1week and stay with friend)\ntrain to DC (3 days and stay with friend)\n18h train to Chicago (5 days)\nFlight to Toronto (5 days)\nDrive to Ottawa(3 days (friend will drive))\ntrain from Ottawa to Montreal (1 week)\ntrain to Quebec city (4 days)\nFlight to Vancouver (1 week)\nFlight home. \n\nI am open to changing up my itinerary but I have never been to Canada before so I\u2019m not sure how to determine exactly where to go and how long is a good amount of time. I am mostly interested in outdoor travel/hiking which is why I\u2019m doing the week in Vancouver. My flight back is booked from Vancouver to Paris so I must end in Vancouver.",

            "comment": "As a Canadian, I'll say that if you're mostly interested in outdoor travel and hiking (and even if you're not), you're skipping the absolute best part of Canada: the Rockies. You can end in Vancouver, but it would be a crime to fly all the way to British Columbia and never leave Greater Vancouver, especially if nature is your main reason for travel. Also, most of Southern Ontario is pretty flat and dull geographically, and while Quebec offers some nature, its offerings pale in comparison to British Columbia (and Alberta).\n\nI live in Ottawa, and honestly, I'd just cut the eastern Canadian leg of your trip entirely. After being in places like Chicago and New York, Ottawa will seem pretty dull, and its most impressive attraction (the main parliament building) is closed for renovations for the next decade. Also, you're already doing two huge, bustling North American cities while in the US; I don't think Toronto and Montreal will add too much that's new for you at that point.\n\nAs for Quebec City - I mean, it's cute and charming, but the \"French-speaking European-style old town\" aspect of it probably has far less novelty for someone from Belgium than it would for a North American.\n\nSo, in short, SPEND MUCH, MUCH MORE TIME IN WESTERN CANADA. British Columbia is home to world-class beauty. Yes, check out Squamish/Garibaldi near Vancouver. But also go elsewhere. Check out Yoho. Check out Glacier National Park. Check out Kokanee. Check out Vancouver Island. British Columbia is HUGE, and three weeks there wouldn't go to waste. Spend a couple of days in Vancouver at the end of your journey, sure, but don't handcuff yourself to daytripping from the city. There's so much to see and do in British Columbia. A little journey over into Western Alberta wouldn't hurt, either.",

            "comment": "Definitely agree w everyone who says focus on BC and Vancouver - yes, absolutely cant go wrong there. I can\u2019t help you much w Chicago except to say that I always had fun there but never stayed in a hostel. My big regret for you is skipping over some of the lovely mountain states like Wyoming or Montana. I get that Colorado is a bit little out of your way but 2 days in Jackson Hole, seeing the Grant Tetons and maybe jumping over into Yellowstone for a bit if you have time will be the best 2 days you spend. And always fantastic food in JH! If you\u2019re there in warmer months, then rafting on the snake river and riding the ski trails on a bmx are high-adrenaline fun and if you\u2019re there in winter, then obviously, there\u2019s high intensity skiing all around. \nHave fun planning!",

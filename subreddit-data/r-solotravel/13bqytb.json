            "comment": "- Give Bangkok justice. It\u2019s got some incredible sights, has interesting urban culture, and the food is spectacular. \n\n- Wrap up Thailand in one go instead of breaking it on either side of Laos. This will avoid the need to buy visas twice and get into unnecessary border questions.\n\n- Koh Phangan has a shady reputation, and the beach parties can get very sus ver fast. Do your research please. Personally, I feel that the Krabi area has a much more iconic seascape than the Koh Samui region, and a good mix of activities.\n\n- Vang Vieng to Koh Phangan will involve transits through Vientiane and Bangkok. It\u2019s inefficient. If you can reorient your trip to wrap up Thailand in one go as suggested earlier, you could move from Vang Vieng to Cambodia overland via stops at Vientiane, Pakse (for Vat Phou), and Si Phan Don river islands. From there, you can cross over to Cambodia and head down to Siem Reap or Phnom Penh by road. Alt, you can just fly from Vientiane.\n\n- From Phnom Penh, you can head up to Hoi An via Ho Chi Minh City (worth 2 days at least) and Nha Trang or Quy Nhon (best beaches in mainland Vietnam). Hoi An also deserves more time - factor in a day trip to Hue for sure. Phong Nha is lovely but there isn\u2019t much to do beyond the caves. The countryside around Ninh Binh will suffice.\n\n- 3 nights on Cat Ba are nice but do not assume they will substitute for the Ha Long Bay cruising experience. \n\nI\u2019d ideally do this as a Bangkok - Phuket/Krabi/Koh Samui - Chiang Mai - Luang Prabang - Vang Vieng - Vientiane - Pakse/Vat Phou - Si Phan Don - Siem Reap - Koh Rong - Phnom Penh - HCMC - Quy Nhon - Hoi An/Hue - Phong Nha - Ninh Binh - Ha Long - Sapa - Hanoi loop.\n\nOf all the places, Koh Rong and Chiang Mai are my least favourite (albeit very nice). The Chiang Mai experience is in a better format at Luang Prabang, I feel, while Koh Rong is still a poor match to the sheer variety of Thai islands.",

In response to some of your points: \n\n-I was hoping to go to the full moon party at kho phangan which seems to only be once a month (hence why I had to break up Thailand into 2 parts)\n\n-Is Ho Chi Minh really worth it? I have heard mixed reviews?\n\n-Cat Ba Island - I was thinking of taking a one day cruise from the island to see ha long bay - do you think that is too short?\n\n-And finally, would you recommend swapping Koh Rong for Krabi area or the beaches in Vietnam that you mentioned?\n\nThanks again for the detailed reply earlier!",

Thailand is amazing in general... everywhere... but the beaches and islands are epic... spend more time is Thailand if you can. Also, phnom phen and cambodia in general has a very heavy vibe. Angkor Wat is a must see but I am guilty of what I consider way too much time in cambodia and had I been to Vietnam first I would have spent every second in cambodia (outside of angkor wat) in Vietnam instead. Vietnam has SO much to see and cambodia just... kinda doesn't. Hope this helps! Also, the Ha Giang loop is a must see but it's very draining and I see it's last on your list after a whirlwind 2 months. Make sure to rest a couple of days before starting the loop so you can enjoy it to the fullest. Also, in my opinion, Hanoi is much more worth your time compared to Saigon (Hanoi is one of a kind), Cat Ba/Halong Bay kinda sucks... go but only do a day trip from Cat Ba (1 day is enough i promise its literally full of garbage and usually overcast, honestly 3 days in Cat Ba is too long theres not much to do) and Koh Phangan is a very fun place worth visiting anytime - honestly i would go when there is NOT a full moon party because there is a big party every night on that island and theyre way more fun when theyre not full of 18 year old amateurs. Have a blast on your trip!!!!!!",

IMO, the parties in Bangkok clubs are way better and safer. In the Koh Samui region, i quite liked the main island more, and Koh Tao for affordable diving.\n\nHCMC doesn\u2019t have much by way of conventional sights but it has an exciting vibe to it, and transiting through is usually very cheap if not cheaper. It\u2019ll also give you a nice counterpoint to Hanoi and a more rounded view of Vietnamese contemporary life. Plus, it\u2019s close enough to the Mekong river delta or Dalat highlands if you end up not liking it much and want to skip forward.\n\nA one day cruise through Ha Long is sufficient but do check the weather trends. If you have the time or option, the Bai Tu Long Bay next door is the same landscape but much fewer tour boats.\n\nI\u2019d pick Krabi. The beaches are pretty, it\u2019s tourist friendly, and the karst cliff landscape is quintessentially Thai. Vietnamese beaches are nice too but a lot depends on which one you pick - near Hoi An, it\u2019s a bit forgettable and stormy, things are much prettier around Nha Trang and Quy Nhon. One option is Phu Quoc, which is basically an extension of Koh Rong but part of Vietnam instead. It\u2019s very touristy and resorty, but is large enough to have quiet spots. There\u2019s also Con Dao, which is very pretty but only accessible by a flight from HCMC.",

If you go to Benjakitti Park, I suggest seeing it during both the day and night).",

Your gonna wanna spend more time in Bangkok, its a world class city where you can do things like roof top patios on sky scrappers, which would cost thousands in the states, in thailand, its like 40$.  If you only do ONE thing in Bangkok, please check out the \"Sky Bar\" its fking UNREAL.  Chiang Mai is also alot of fun, tons of expats, but Bangkok your GONNA wanna explore, trust me on this one.  Flights were so cheap i didnt have to pre book at all, Thailand is amazing tbh, i loved my time there, the people are extremely friendly and kind, unless your one of those losers that just throws there beer cans on the ground at the beach - That pissed me off so much, dunno whats wrong with some of you countries no reason to be that fkn rude in there land. I think im honestly gonna go back on a solo trip its quite the experience. There are some secret ex pat bars in Chiang Mai to where you can find digital nomads and retired military vets, super cool vibes.",

Hoi An is one of those places which is cool the first time, but it is just a tourist spot.  There is no depth to it. As for suits, I have made my living in that space for many years.  Hoi An tailoring is mediocre.  If you want a hand tailored suit for a cheap price, go for it.  But don't think that you are buying a high or even medium quality suit.\n\nOn the other hand, Hanoi is a great city with great culture, cuisine, friendly people.",

But try and stay flexible.\n\nI only skimmed through the itinerary, but if you've never been to Bangkok, I'd give yourself at least a couple days to explore there. Some people hate it, but I quite like it there. Quite a lot to see and do. And a cool mix of modern city and traditional.\n\nChiang Mai is nice, but I wouldn't necessarily spend 4 days there (unless you're doing something like a hill tribe trek overnight somewhere).\n\nWeather wise, it usually doesn't rain constantly, and different areas have different weather. So again allow flexibility for that. If the weather sucks, hop on a flight to another part of the country and you might be fine.",

Chiang Mai is probably fine for 2 days - visit the temple up on the hill, find an ethical elephant place to visit, and just explore the old town/temples and night markets.\n\nI'd say if you had the time, Pai was worth a visit too. \n\nBut Luang Prabang has the waterfalls, a good viewpoint for sunset. And even Vang Vieng is good - for the river tubing as well as lot sof swim spots to explore by scooter.",

If you get sick, it slows things down, so you have to expect things won\u2019t exactly match your plans and that is okay. I became okay with missing some specific sites so that I could more easily enjoy where I was. \n\nSpecific to Vietnam, I really enjoyed my time in Dalat, known as the city of eternal spring. The weather is much cooler and the air feels so fresh in the mountains. It feels much less touristy and has beautiful sites surrounding the city a short motorbike away (coffee farms, waterfall). I didn\u2019t drive a motorbike anywhere else on my trip except here since I was told it\u2019s a safer place to drive and I wanted to be cautious. Hoi An to me felt super overcrowded and expensive, but perhaps that was because it was during Vietnam holidays, I only spent 1 night there. I have heard Danang may have decent beaches? Someone else can check me there. I loved North Vietnam and didn\u2019t regret think spending more time up there for all the nature. \n\nI had to spend less time in Cambodia simply because it was too hot, (landlocked and AC wasn\u2019t as reliable); I think having a plan to fall back to is good but you should be flexible too.",

            "comment": "Just finished a two month SE Asia trip this year to almost exactly all the same spots! My tips:\n- Spend more time in Hoi An, especially if you\u2019re wanting to get clothes made. It will take several appointments. And it\u2019s a cool city! You can go to the beach easily there too. \n- Spend less time in Phong Nha, unless you\u2019re really into caves. \n- One night is enough for cat ba, then one night in Ha Long Bay/actually would recommend Lang Ha Bay instead (less trash). \n- I skipped the full moon party and went to koh Tao instead and I was glad I did! Nice beaches to chill but also lots of bars, diving. I met a lot of people who had their phones stolen at the full moon party so just be extra careful if you do go. \n- I stayed in Ha Giang the night before I started the loop instead of taking the bus from Hanoi that day and was grateful for that. \n- Make sure you have perfect bills for the visa in Laos. \n- Nong Khiaw was one of the most memorable stops I made, ended up staying there 4 nights because it was so pretty and a good way to see how the people in rural villages live. A little more off the beaten track. \n- I did skip HCMC and Phnom Penh and did not feel like I missed out \n- You can rent a motorbike without a license, but best not to if you have no experience. You can almost always find a grab or something. I fell on mine and met a lot of people who had much worse outcomes than my road rash! \n- I think with the rainy season the rice fields will be beautiful in Thailand!",

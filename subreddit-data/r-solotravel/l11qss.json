Just because someone has patterns of self harm, or even regularly fantasizes about killing themselves- DOESNT mean he had those thoughts all the time. Its just depression that sometimes, or an evening or a moment that gets so bad you actually have the urge to do it. Its very likely most of the time he actually would describe himself as happy, depression isn't an emotion is a rot that infects you no matter how you feel, no matter how much you love your life.",

And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire\u2019s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It\u2019s not desiring the fall; it\u2019s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \u2018Don\u2019t!\u2019 and \u2018Hang on!\u2019, can understand the jump. Not really. You\u2019d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.\u201d*\n\nHe loved his daughter. It isn\u2019t about bravery or cowardice or that life\u2019s debits and credits do not square. The flames were just too hot for too long.",

We bend over backward to make it how you want it and truly want to only give you the best possible experience. And when you work in a joint that has that extra spark, then you become like family. Catch is, within 2 years you, or half the staff, will likely move along to someplace else. It\u2019s a transient lifestyle. Not saying that you can\u2019t put down roots, but unless you own the business you work in? It\u2019s probably not gonna last. We are sadomasochistic at the heart. Working 80+ hrs a week doing drugs and drinking booze to keep going and then to shut down. The mental health problem in restaurants is second to none. But we love these broken culinary assassins. They are our kin. So pay attention when you go out to eat to how the back of the house is if you can get a peak. And a quick word to one of the cooks will light him up like Christmas. This pandemic has crushed many of our dreams. And my heart goes out to all my brothers and sisters out there chained to a fryer. Love y\u2019all!",

    "postText": "I usually use a straw rigid trilby. It's a good hat, stylish but practical. I have fair skin so I need something to keep the sun off my face.\n\nHowever, because it's so rigid it's not ideal for packing as it either needs to be worn or carried. It can't go inside a bag because of it's shape and the fact it would be crushed.\n\nWhat hats do you guys take? I'd identify like something similar but made of a material that can be crushed and then would spring back into life when it's comes out of a backpack. Any suggestions?",

My current favourite travel hat is a Wallaroo Petite Scrunchie, which rolls up *tiny*, has a wide brim and is rated UPF 50+. It's lightweight and looks good and may be the best travel hat I've ever owned. They have it in regular sizes too. (Wallaroo also has men's packable hats, BTW.)",

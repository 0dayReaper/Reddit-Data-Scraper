I wonder if they treat you differently traveling Solo and I've had terrible experiences with security guards outside of TSA. I have a fear of getting a pat-down because as a male my balls are sensitive and I feel like it's very invasive. I watched a story about a woman being suspected of drugs and even though she didn't have any they strip searched her and basically cavity searched her since they had her spread her butt cheeks. I know the strip searches are rare and that I can lower my chances of a pat-down but I have enough trauma from my childhood to not want to deal with all that.",

The kneestrike to the groin that they gave all passengers post 9/11 was a short lived security measure that was ultimately found ineffective at preventing terrorism.",

It\u2019s probably unfair to outright assume that racial profiling is the cause and not just bad luck but there\u2019s a trend that airports in whiter populations like Denver and Salt Lake City give me a harder time at the TSA than say Chicago or Philadelphia. Although, The worst that happens is the uncomfortable and underpaid TSA agent does a pat down and they take a few minutes to empty my bag. I\u2019ve never had a horrible enough experience to warrant a complaint or miss a flight. \n\nThe funniest incident I had was an agent yanked me aside and said \u201cwe got an alarm on your bag so you\u2019ve been randomly selected for additional screening\u201d. I just kinda stood there for a bit because I\u2019d assumed he would grab my bag and lead me over to the back table like usual but then he turned to me and said \u201cwhich ones your bag?\u201d I\u2019m thinking Umm if you got an alarm on it, wouldn\u2019t you know which one it was or are you just giving me a hard time for some reason? Pat down, bag check, sent me on my way. More annoying than malicious \n\nYou\u2019ll be fine, thousands of people go through TSA every day with no horror stories to tell afterwards. You gotta be really trying to hide something for them to take you to the back room and make you strip down. Your balls are safe",

If you\u2019ve got an anxiety disorder or trauma that\u2019s one thing but everyday people have no reason to be scared of passing through TSA. \n\nEven if you get pulled to the side for any reason which is rare (happens to me on maybe less than 5% of my flights and I take 2-3 dozen a year), the odds of them needing to Pat down uncomfortable spots is a fraction of even that. \n\nUsually the scanner puts up a little yellow box on the area it didn\u2019t get a good picture of like a forearm or chest, they find you an agent that matches your gender, ask you if you\u2019d prefer to go somewhere private, and pat down over your clothes.

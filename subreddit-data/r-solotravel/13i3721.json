    "postText": "Hey all, I'm currently coming to the end  of a 12 day trip to Iceland, Denmark and Germany and to be honest i'm finding the trip kinda boring. I'm a young 20s male who previously traveled to Colombia (solo), Mexico and Peru (with my GF). Maybe I am romanticizing the past but when I was there, I felt a sense of adventure that I do not feel in Europe. In Colombia, I felt a sense of fear because not only was it my first solo trip but I've also heard Colombia is not very safe. Funny enough, I did get robbed in Colombia but now I look back and laugh at myself for being so stupid and allowing myself to go into a easily avoidable situation. In Mexico and Peru, the culture was also vastly different and I feel the activities there are much more exciting (dune buggies, temples, hiking, interacting with the locals more). Meanwhile here in Europe, in a way I feel too safe. Too safe that I am not getting out of my comfort zone. The public transport is so good that I can find easily find my way around. I feel like I have not been able to find any truly adventurous activities but simply museums and historic buildings. For reference, I have been to Reyjavik, Copenhagen, Berlin and Hamburg. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I simply doing Europe wrong, or do you guys also find Europe to be lacking a sense of adventure?\n\nEdit: for some reason, everyone here thinks I want to get robbed again. No, I just want to get out my comfort zone.",

I've been out of my comfort zone plenty more than you have. And I've never yearned for more danger in my life or complained about how safe developed countries feel. That's the thing that is making you come off as douche in this thread, that your complaints are \"I can safely walk around at night\" and \"it's hard to get lost using public transportation\" while equally hyping the sense of adventure you get from potential of being a victim of a crime. And despite only having gone to a handful of countries, you want to tell others they should \"get out of their comfort zone\" lol",

Of course, most people enjoy an adrenaline rush now and then, but if you\u2019re bored by everything else, that\u2019s an unhealthy dependency.\n\nFrankly, it comes across sounding like the same kind of immature, irresponsible approach to travel that gets people like Miles Routledge in over their heads",

You visited Iceland - a country where careless tourists die to nature regularly enough that people are warned about it - but you stayed in the small, cozy place known for being one of the safest hipster capitals on the surface of the Earth. A quick trip to the nearest tourist agency could've gotten you in touch with people who'd put you on the back of a horse and bring you out into the volcanic glacial sandstorm wastes, where nature is big and you are small.\n\nAdventures exist in safe places, too, because people always thirst for adventure. But they're typically arranged adventures that you need to look for, not adventures that wacks you over the head to steal your purse.

You can also go mountain biking in many places where there are mountains and on the coast of like Portugal, lots of opportunities to surf.

There\u2019s also the Taj Mahal which is a wonderful thing to see",

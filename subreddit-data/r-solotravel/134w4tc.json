    "postText": "Looking for some feedback about my itinerary. I do a lot of driving for work so I\u2019m not worried about the drive between one place to the next. My days usually starts at 0500 and I\u2019m back in bed around 2300. So I\u2019m use to long days. Will I be tired at the end of each day? I hope so! With that said, anyone who lives in Ireland or has done a lot of traveling there, I\u2019m interested in your thoughts. \nYou may be able to tell from my list that my focus is more nature and scenery. I don\u2019t mind popping into a great local pub! \n\n-May 20 \narrive in Dublin spend the day getting adjusted. \n-May 21\nKilkenny Castle\nThe Rock of Cashel\nCork\n-May 22\nKillarney\nTorc Waterfall\nGleninchaguin Park\nDingle\n-May 23\nFoynes (maybe skip)\nLaugh Gur\nLimerick\nCliff of Moher \n-May 24\nGalway\nAshford Castle\n-May 25\nKylemore Abbey Castle\nDownpatrick Head\nGlencar waterfall \nDevils chimney waterfall\n-May 26\nLargy Waterfall\nSliabg Liag\nAssaranca\n-May27\nGiant\u2019s Causeway \nBelfast\n-May 28\nDublin\n-May 29\nDepart",

Narrow roads, tractors, clumps of bicyclists, pedestrians\u2026 it can be exhausting going 100 km. Have fun!",

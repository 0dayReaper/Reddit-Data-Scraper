    "postText": "I'm planning a solo trip to northeast Brazil in late August and hoping to get recs for a mix of natural beauty/beaches, outdoor activities, and some nightlife, local culture, or unique experiences\n\nbrief bio for context: 35yo large single male, fairly well-solo-traveled in Latin/South America. Native English, advanced Spanish, intermediate Portuguese. Been to Brazil 4x but mostly touristy areas around Rio, SP, Floripa, Salvador. For safety context, I recently traveled solo throughout Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico (and solo in Brazil in years past) without issue and never felt truly unsafe... common sense, some research about where not to go/what not to do, a polite attitude and a sixth sense for ejecting from sketchy situations has served me well so far. \n\nI'm mostly looking to stay in towns/cities nearby nice beach areas and enjoy the local scenery, culture and food. I'd like to meet locals or Brazilians traveling domestically, so some level of nightlife/communal gatherings is preferred though I'm not a late night club person, much prefer more relaxed bars or laid back-ish blocos.\n\nAnother challenge is planning 2 weeks in an efficient manner to see multiple states while minimizing travel time... I'm expecting I'll have to link a few flights together across the major coastal cities but will realistically only be able to do 3 regions max. I'm also considering renting a car since distances are significant down the coast between cities and spots of interest... I've gotten mixed opinions on whether or not that is safe/recommended (I drive in heavy city traffic daily and have driven in many countries so most scenarios don't bother me) so if you feel strongly either way please feel free to share.\n\nSome areas of interest I've flagged for further research include:\n\nMA:  S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Len\u00e7\u00f3is Maranhenses\n\nCE: Jericoacoara, Fortaleza, Cumbuco\n\nPB: Jo\u00e3o Pessoa \n\nRN: Tibau do Sul/Praia da Pipa\n\nPE: Recife/Porto de Galinhas\n\nAL: Maragogi\n\nBA: Praia do Forte, Morro de S\u00e3o Paulo, Barra Grande, Itacar\u00e9, Porto Seguro &amp; Trancoso\n\nIf you've been to any of these locations and can share positive/negative color or recommendations on can't-miss things, all tips are appreciated!",

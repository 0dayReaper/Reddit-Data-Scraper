    "postText": "Some incoming eat, pray, love shit.\n\nI have been in Mexico for about a month now, flying back home tomorrow and reflecting back on my mental state before my trip and after my trip...the difference has been huge. I was an anxious, depressed mess before my trip and had been for the past six months and knew it wasn't healthy but wasn't doing anything about it either. I know the past two years have been hard on everyone and everyone is sick of it but I also don't think anyone thought it would last this long and the effects of isolation on people's mental health has been very evident.\n\nWhile I am vaxxed and have done my part to look out for others throughout this process, it has been very hard on my mental not being able to travel, try new restaurants, go see live music, see my friends and family...these are all things that bring me joy in life. It had gotten to the point where when things started opening back up, I didn't even want to see my friends and would just spend my weekends hanging out in my room alone. Social interactions that seemed so normal before became so awkward and forced and I just found myself avoiding them.\n\nThe things I have done and experienced and the people I have met on this trip have made me feel alive again. Solo traveling, especially being a solo female traveler, has made me feel so empowered again. I am very happy, positive, and hopeful for the first time in a long time and it is a great feeling.\n\nHope you all are well and thriving and enjoying your solo trips. That is all.",

            "comment": "Hey, 172173, it looks like you are writing about possible mental health issues. As always, a reminder that for people struggling with mental health, solo travel is not a substitute for professional help--and that the stress of travel (unfamiliar surroundings/languages, culture shock, lack of a support network) can sometimes exacerbate these issues. If you are experiencing a genuine mental health crisis, please reach out to your nearest crisis centre/counselor/hotline. Meanwhile, we have an [excellent post about solo travel and mental health](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/mentalhealth) in our Wiki that you might find worth reading.",

Not by a lot, I can pretty much go anywhere except Yemen and some other failed states/war zones, and now Russia and Ukraine. But I have to itemize my foreign contacts that I will be staying with and disclose that to the govt so while that doesn\u2019t seem like a big thing, it\u2019s just enough to have me focus on the US first.",

Problem is you cant travel 24/7 365 a year....i mean i guess you could but eventually somewhere will become home and those problems that caused depression in the first place likely arent gone...they follow you and if you don't address whats causing it, it will continue to creep up throughout your life. Travel is great for a change of pace, new scenery, and of you're in a rut...but its not a cure for real mental illness.",

Not seeing family and friends, not going on trips or going out, etc. because I wanted to be socially responsible. I know things are changing now and I believe this will become an endemic but I have certainly missed out on doing a lot of things the past two years.\n\nBut also people have different levels of how serious they are taking it and how they are handling it so just because you've been comfortable traveling the past year and been fine doesn't mean that everyone else should be too.",

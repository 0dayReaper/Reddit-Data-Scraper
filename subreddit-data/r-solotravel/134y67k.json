I'm also wondering if the backpacking scene is back, since I'm quite social and would like to meet and travel with other people. Thanks in advance!",

In Cusco and Arequipa there were massive protests as well but it's calm now. I don't know the whole picture but in regions outside Lima there's a lot of bad blood because of mineral rights, company privileges and Lima wanting to centralize all power. And then the arrest of the president that they supported kicked off all of the protests.",

So yeah, the backpacking scene is probably back or at least coming back. Probably even faster than before cause people have waited to go there. I\u2019ve heard Lima has a high police presence but is fine, and yeah the rest is like others said; mostly completely fine, puno seems a bit tense but I\u2019ve met loads of people who travelled thru there, into or from Bolivia, and had no issues. So I\u2019d say go!",

People would reference the social unrest and discuss the impacts on tourism, but otherwise nbd. \n\nThere\u2019s definitely less tourists still. That was a consistent message in all locations. People both happy to see us and sad the numbers were way down. It worked for us as many of the popular places had ~30% or less of the normal daily visitors (estimated by our guides). We didn\u2019t do hostels, but I imagine those might be a bit light still.",

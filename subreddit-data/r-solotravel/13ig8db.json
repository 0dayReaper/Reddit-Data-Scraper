    "postText": "Hello. I will be 18 this summer and will have a full drivers license, passport and vaccine status. I was planning on taking a road trip across the northern USA and into Canada. Will I have any trouble being 18 and traveling alone in my car. Or are there driving laws in Canada that prevent this. Or will I need a tourist license or something else. Thank you.",

I went for a weekend trip and crossed by land, but they wanted a general idea of where I\u2019d be going, how much money I brought, and what I\u2019d be doing even for that. They may be a little more stern with you since you\u2019re only 18 and planning to do this solo, but just have it ready to go to make it smooth.",

Must sees are Tofino, Ucluelet, and Pacific Rim National Park. \n\nIf you want to head to northern BC, it\u2019s a wild place but super beautiful. Check out Barkerville maybe- in its mining heyday it was the largest town in North America north of SF and west of Chicago. \n\nSouthern BC has the Okanagan, which is Canada\u2019s wine country (but you can\u2019t drink in BC yet, you have to be 19). A town called Osoyoos contains the country\u2019s only desert and warmest lake.\n\nIf you are feeling super adventurous, you might want to take the ferry over to Haida Gwaii.\n\nYou can stay in Canada for up to six months before you have to leave. In Alberta, don\u2019t forget to enjoy a ice cold Kokanee beer - drinking is legal at 18 there. Enjoy!!",

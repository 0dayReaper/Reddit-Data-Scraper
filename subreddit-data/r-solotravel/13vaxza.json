    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am really excited to be doing my first solo trip to Italy soon. I have a rough itinerary which I intend to follow but would appreciate any advice. \n\nPlan is as follows:\n\nDay 1 (Saturday) - Arrive in Milan (Flight booked and arrive around 5PM). I intend to get dinner and spend the evening exploring the city.\n\nDay 2 (Sunday) - Explore Milan and the various attractions (Duomo di Milano, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II). I intend to leave this city in the evening around 7PM to go to the next city.\n\nDay 3 (Monday) - Explore city (Parma/Genoa or open to any other suggestions for cities I could visit)\n\nDay 4 &amp; 5 (Tuesday and Wednesday) - I will be in Modena for these two days as I plan to visit the Ferrari and Lamborghini Museums. I intend to leave Modena in the early evening on Wednesday for Bologna. I will explore Bologna in the evening and spend the night there.\n\nDay 6 (Thursday) - Explore Bologna and fly out from here.\n\nMy main concern is Day 3 - should I go to Genoa or Parma? I am more interested in Genoa and would like to visit this city, however Parma is on the route to Modena which is a non-negotiable destination for me. I am open to visiting any other interesting cities too, suggestions would be welcome!\n\nThanks so much!",

It\u2019s worth walking through as it\u2019s right by the Duomo, but I wouldn\u2019t plan on spending a lot of time there. \n\nYou should see the Last Supper while you\u2019re there. You\u2019ll need to book a timeslot ahead of time. And I\u2019d also recommend the Ambrosian Library, it\u2019s a museum that has some of da Vinci\u2019s notebook pages on display.",

Old college town with a big pedestrianized area and beautiful piazzas. Would recommend using Milan as a base and getting a cheap 3 day transit pass that lets you go anywhere in Lombardy. Bergamo or cities on Lake Como or Maggiore could be other possibilities for a day. Might be easier than going off to another city for one night",

    "postText": "I'm super nervous and have had mix feelings all week; mostly just excitement and anxiety. I know overall this is going to be an amazing experience for me either way and will help me to grow but it is still nerve wrecking. I have always loved to travel but when I have gone in the past, its usually with my girlfriend at the time, friends or a group experience. This will be the first time where I am truly on my own. I wanted to make a post here because i have been lurking this subreddit for a while and I find it to be very engaging and it seems that the community has a lot to say. I wanted to share my Itinerary with you all and maybe get some insight into your experiences in the countries/cities I'm going to, things to avoid, hidden gem restaurants, things you would have done differently, things that are must-dos, or just any practical advice you'd give to a first time solo traveler. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Greece** \n   * **Athens** from the 11-14th (4 days)\n      * Probably will check out the Acropolis \n   * **Mykonos**  from the 14-18th (4 days)\n      * Nothing really planned honestly, was hoping to make friends, go clubbing, rent a ATV to take a look around the island maybe.\n* **Italy**\n   * **Rome** 18-22nd (5 days)\n      * The Vatican is my main focus but here I am happy to just wander the city, find good food, see the buildings and just take in the culture\n* **Croatia**\n   * **Split** 22-27 (5 days)\n      * Was thinking about doing some sort of boat party but other than that the only must is to see Krka Waterfalls\n\nI'm going to be flying to each destination except Mykonos where I will just be taking the fast ferry from Athens. I also will be staying in hostels the entire time. I am a 27 year old male and am pretty extroverted. I think what worries me the most is not being able to make friends because in the past, meeting people around the world during my travels is always the highlight. Wish me luck and thanks in advance to anyone who offers any advice/feedback!",

            "comment": "Athens is great, and Greece does a wonderful job with their historic sites. You can buy a combo ticket that gets you into much more than just the Acropolis, for only a small amount more than the solo ticket. \n\nThe Acropolis Museum is awesome, and very affordable. Same goes for the Archaeological Museum, which is in a different part of town. Actually everything in Greece is very affordable. \n\nI\u2019d also recommend taking the furnicular up to the top of Mount Lycabettus for an awesome view. Or you could hike if you\u2019re feeling up to it. \n\nYou have *got* to book your ticket for the Vatican Museums as early as possible. Even half an hour after they open in the morning is too late. It\u2019s wall to wall people. They sell a \u201cbefore they open breakfast tour\u201d that\u2019s more expensive, but many say it\u2019s worth it. All I can tell you personally is that you do NOT want to be in there in the middle of the day. You can barely even move. \n\nSt. Peter\u2019s Basilica is far more open as far as space goes, but if you line up for security about half an hour before they open, you\u2019ll basically have the place to yourself. \n\nYou need to book tickets for the Colosseum or anywhere else ASAP. People on r/Rome are saying the city is absolutely slammed right now. \n\nFive days is a lot of time in Rome if you don\u2019t have any specific interests other than Vatican City. If you find yourself with extra time, maybe hop a high speed train to Florence for a day.",

You can book them on the website or with the Trenitalia app.\n\nYou\u2019ll wind up at Santa Maria Novella train station, which is about a 10 minute walk to Santa Maria del Fiore. Florence is really compact and you can walk everywhere.\n\nNaples is about an hour from Rome too, and you can get to Pompeii on the commuter train from there if you\u2019re into that.",

It's not that krka is not worth it, but a day trip from split is actually doable and reasonable (takes 1 whole day) and that park is amazing.\n\nHvar is allegedly a party island from Split. I went during off season so it wasn't something I was looking for. But boat parties might also be in that direction. Just please consider the islands that are very close to Split. \n\nI recommend staying at Backpackers Fairytale hostel and taking a free day tour (tip at the end). At night time, there's usually live music at the courtyard in front of the emperor's door, you'll know where that is after your tour.",

They picked me up from my hotel, drove the group to the park, and then took us to a private vineyard for wine and lunch. \n\nI would also recommend any of the \u2018Blue Lagoon\u2019 tours on Airbnb Experiences as well. I did a couple and each took us to different islands and some really blue blue waters. Some tours even stopped for the Mojito Man!\n\nHave fun!",

    "postText": "Hey,\n\nI booked a last minute ticket to Sydney Australia leaving next Sunday and have nothing planned yet. Any recommendations on places to visit? Staying for 2.5 weeks and looking to Surf, hike, see the great barrier reef, and meet some other people. I am also open to doing pretty much anything if anybody has any random suggestions on things to see or do. Looking to go to other places besides Sydney, again anywhere! Budget is $3000.",

For activities that needed prior reservation/tickets in advance was that hard to secure? I\u2019m headed there next month and don\u2019t want to have everything planned to T because there\u2019s no flexibility in that but I also don\u2019t want to risk not having a place to stay because it got all booked out",

Prices don't seem to increase significantly with day-of booking and I've never had to spend a night on the street. Even in places like Rome that are infamous for being \"booked up\" I've found a room after contacting 2 or 3 places at like 7pm.",

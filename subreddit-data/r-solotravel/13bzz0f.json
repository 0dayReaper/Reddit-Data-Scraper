    "postText": "Hi I\u2019m doing a group tour which starts in Rome, incorporates Spain, then goes to Portugal, first Lagos, and ends in Lisbon. The tour is 16 days and finishes on 18th June in Lisbon. I have another week free to travel and so am planning to travel around Portugal for this time. I am unsure of whether I should give the full 5 days to Lisbon or travel to a few different locations. \n\nThe group trip will have been very fast paced involving trains planes and buses (itinerary below) so I would like to give my solo week more of a slow relaxed pace.\n\nGroup Trip:\n\nDay 1 begins in Rome\n\nDay 2 Pisa Day trip plus travel to Rapallo\n\nDay 3 Rapallo\n\nDay 4 Nice\n\nDay 5 Monaco Day trip\n\nDay 6 Fly to Barcelona\n\nDay 7 Barcelona\n\nDay 8 Afternoon head to Madrid\n\nDay 9 Madrid\n\nDay 10Madrid Afternoon to Granada\n\nDay 11 Granada\n\nDay 12 Travel to Seville\n\nDay 13 Travel to Lagos\n\nDay 14 Lagos\n\nDay 15 travel to Lisbon\n\nDay 16 Lisbon -trip ends\n\nSo far my itinerary for after the trip is\n\nDay 1 (18th June) Explore Bairro Alto/Chiado/Alfama and Time-out market\n\n\nDay 2 Tram 28 and a day trip to Sintra\n\n\nDay 3 Belem/Castelo de Sao Jorge / LX Factory\n\n\nDay 4- Aveiro or get train to Porto or back to Lagos\n\nThen spend 2 days in either Porto exploring, visiting vineyards, or go back to Lagos and enjoy the beach.\n\nI love historic sites and museums but also love relaxing on the beach so would like a bit of both. Can anyone provide suggestions on whether Porto or back to Lagos would be best? Or if there\u2019s somewhere even better I haven\u2019t heard about!\n\nAlso does my plan for Lisbon look realistic or am I trying to fit too much into three days?\n\nI will be using public transport",

Particularly since you'll already have seen the Algarve, to me the clear answer is Nazare, which is in between Lisbon and Porto and is a fantastic beach town.\n\n[Here is I would do 6 days from Lisbon to Porto with Nazare](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=lisbon$2$r~nazare$2$r~coimbra$0$e~porto$2$r&amp;trans=Mixed&amp;nights=6&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;). I would do the two Lisbon days exactly as you have Day 1 and 2 planned, then 2 nights in the beach town of Nazare, then 2 in Porto, potentially with a stop in Coimbra for a few hours on the way up if that looks interesting to you.",

I didn't much care for the super touristy things in Lisbon like tram 28 and that elevator to the lookout tower both of which were insanely crowded.  The beach towns in the south on the coast are really nice I stayed in abufeira and it was fantastic.",

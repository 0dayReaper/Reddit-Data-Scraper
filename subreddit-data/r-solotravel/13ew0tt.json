    "postText": "Good afternoon people,\n\nI'm going to Morocco in June for 15 days and I was wondering if you could help me out with my itinerary.\n\nI'm landing in Fes and I'm leaving from marrakech because those were the cheapest flights I could get.\n\nI'm planning on doing something like:\n\n\\- Fes, 3 days\n\n\\- Chefchaouen, 2 days\n\n\\- Rabat, 3 days\n\n\\- Essaouira, 2 days\n\n\\- Marrakech, 2 days + I was planning on doing the merzouga overnight in the dessert\n\nI think I have 1 or 2 days left with this, what do you think?\n\nCan I do the merzouga tour and get back to Marrakech? should I do it first and then visit other places?",

Also consider accounting for travel time, morocco is really big and it takes hours to get to different cities and you may be tired. Check out Rome2Rio for better estimates.",

That is an incredibly long day and long drive.\nI did 3 weeks and spent alot of time in a car the desert will be hot but I wished I had spent more than 1 day. It was the hi-lite of my trip. Got, get a place with a pool.\nMarrakesh is fine, a bit touristy but I actually liked it. Stayed in the medina in Fez and was a bit overwhelmed.\n2 favorite spots, Merzouga &amp; Essouria",

            "comment": "Yeah you don't need 3 days in rabat. It's great and don't skip it but 2 days is enough. Leave yourself enough time to go to and from the desert and spend an entire day there and night ideally - so 1 day to get to the desert 1 night there, and a good part of the day the next. Also rabat to Essaouira is a long trip. I'd break it up by going to Marrakech on the train first, maybe stay a night, then bus or grand taxi to Essaouira and stay a couple days there. Then you can go back to Marrakech and see some stuff before the desert, then finish your trip and fly out.",

You could do 1 day 1 night there. \n\nSo in theory:\n\nArrive fes. 2 nights fes\n\n2 nights chefchaouen (leave from fes by bus, return to fes by bus)\n\nTrain to rabat\n\n1 night in rabat \n\nTrain to Marrakech, spend the night, relax\n\nBus to Essaouira\n\n2 nights Essaouira\n\nBus back to kech\n\nDesert tour 2 days/1 night (or however long you want)\n\nBack to Marrakech, spend another night or 2, explore\n\nBasically fes is a base for chefchaouen and Marrakech is a base for Essaouira and the desert",

Fes and Marrakech can be overwhelming. The most important thing to remember is that you are NOT RUDE if you need to ignore or say no to people and you need to be more forceful than you think. Know where you are going and walk with purpose, don't let people give you things as gifts (they are never gifts) and don't accept anyone taking you somewhere 'just to show you the way' (they want money). Don't get in a cab unless it's running the meter or you've agreed on a price. Make sure to eat bissara soup in fes and have an amazing time!!!",

I've never done it unfortunately.  another cheaper and possibly fastest option could actually be to take a bus or taxi to tangier and then take the fast train. It's less than 2h from tangier to rabat and the train is really cool. Then bonus you get to see tangier too",

    "postText": "Hi all, I'm currently in the process of booking a trip to Japan from the UK, coming home via Seoul and Singapore. I'd be looking at \\~\u00a32000 booking individually with airlines, which I've tended to do in the past with trips to single countries, but Expedia are offering \u00a31100 for that route. [(Here's the itinerary)](https://imgur.com/a/iaWgFLS)\n\nSeems too good to be true, right? I know they're a (relatively) reputable company but a little concerned about a few things.\n\nFirstly, I've seen (mostly Americans) talk about OTAs changing their flights, charging through the nose and cancelling without warning. Is this true in the UK/EU too?\n\nSecondly is that layover in Zurich is mighty short. Flights have been chaos all year in the UK, always delayed. If I booked through Swiss directly, I know I'd get bumped to the next flight if there was a delay, but will Expedia be able/willing to do the same? I dread to think what would happen if my first flight out is delayed and I'm stuck in Zurich with hundreds/thousands spent on accommodation in Japan. An on the spot ticket just isn't in my price range.\n\nAs long as Expedia book Manc-Tokyo on a single ticket, I imagine it'll be all good, but any way I can ensure that's the case before dropping a non-refundable \u00a31100 on this?\n\nAnyone got experiences with this?\n\nCheers.",

It is the airline making changes, but you\u2019d need to work with the OTA on any of that rather than directly with the airline. \n\nWhat are the fare classes, luggage and other inclusions? Often the fares shown on OTA have additional fees and add-ons. That can account for the difference in price.",

            "comment": "The problem is if you book with OTAs and in the event you miss the connection you don't have much control over your booking and the airline may direct you to the agent to find resolutions. With those short Swiss air transfers I would book direct with the airline.\n\nOTAs don't change flights but airlines might and if that happens you'll have to go through the OTA to make arrangements with the airline instead of getting direct assistance. To me, if it was just 1 direct flight I might take the risk with Expedia but looking at the itinerary it looks like adding unnecessary risks to me if you book with Expedia.\n\nScoot airfares come with carry on only, I am assuming you will need checked baggage? You need to check all the inclusions to make sure the price difference is not due to these.",

            "comment": "This is not a single ticket at all. These are separated tickets and you personally are responsible for being on time for all your flights. The cheap price comes from precisely the fact that you are responsible for your connections because when airlines are responsible for your last minute rebookings on a continuous ticket, that extra cost is already priced in. \n\nI personally would never fly this itinerary. The risk for last minute rebooking is high.",

            "comment": "I think you might be getting these prices by having functionally 4 legs in this routing.  \n\nIt looks like you could take Air France through CDG to NRT on Aug 22nd, and return SIN -&gt; CDG -&gt; MAN on Sept 26 for 1010quid.\n\nThen just buy the Japan to Seoul, and Seoul to SIN flights separately. I doubt those 2 flights would be another 1000 quid, or even half that. \n\nThe AF routes are ~18.5 hours each way, which implies manageable layover times.",

    "postText": "I (M28) am currently planning a 10 day trip to Belgium and the Netherlands in August. I am pretty much set in starting my trip in Ghent since I\u2019ve seen it getting recommended here a lot over Brussels and Brussels/Antwerp/Bruges are easy to reach.\n\nMy current draft itinerary looks like this:\n\n* Day 1+2: Ghent\n* Day 3: Day trip to Brussels\n* Day 4: Day trip to Antwerp or Bruges\n* Day 5: Slow day / break\n* Day 6: Bruges or Antwerp (Not sure if day trip or stay there for 2 nights in the days 5-7ish range)\n* Days 7-10: Amsterdam\n\nI have planned to have one day where I at least don\u2019t want to do that much because I am pretty sure every single day in and between cities will be tiring. I am pretty sure to do Brussels on a day trip but other than that I am still debating whether I should do Antwerp and Bruges on day trips too or stay in one of these cities for 2 nights. I definitely don\u2019t want to be sleeping in another city everyday but then again it feels a bit long to stay in Ghent for 5-6 days, granted with a lot of day trips to other cities.\n\nFor the Netherlands I will probably be sleeping in Amsterdam for about 4 nights and spend at least 2 full days there with one day trip I am still thinking about a destination between Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht (anything I forgot?).\n\nWhat do you think? I appreciate any kind of tips or suggestions, thank you!",

            "comment": "Good plans! I also don't like moving every day so I think you made a lot of smart choices. You can do Bruges and Antwerp as day trips. I have read people suggesting spending a night in Bruges and I disagree. While it's a beautiful city, it's also a tourist town to the point of being a dead soul. You will enjoy spending a day there and seeing the sights, but it's not a deep city and doesn't require spending the night to really get the most out of it. Ghent is a much better base, don't change it.\n\nAntwerp is also definitely a \"real\" city too so you could consider spending some nights there but it's also not a huge deal. The trains are good and like I said, Ghent is a good base.",

            "comment": "Ghent really is an under-rated place to overnight, so good pick. Here are the changes I would make:\n\n - 2 nights in Bruges (furthest west, and well worth an uninterrupted day)\n\n - 2 nights in Ghent, with daytrip to Brussels.\n\n - See Antwerp enroute to Delft. It unfolds perfectly from it's train station for a there-and-back walk, and there are convenient luggage lockers at the station.\n\n - Daytrip to Rotterdam and/or the Hague from Delft - the Vermeer museums in the last 2 work particularly well together.\n\n - 4 nights in Amsterdam, with either a daytrip to Haarlem or visit enroute.\n\n[Here is what that 10 day Bruges-&gt;Amsterdam route looks like](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=bruges$2$r~ghent$2$r~antwerp$0$e~delft$2~haarlem$0$e~amsterdam$4$r&amp;trans=Train&amp;nights=10&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;). It may seem like a lot, but it's really low intensity because of how efficient the trains are - only around an average of a half hour of train travel per day.\n\nHappy travels!",

Bruges is farthest away from everything by train and it\u2019s really small. A day is more than enough, there is nothing to do in the evening, whereas Antwerp will be very vibrant at night in August.\nSo it would look something like this:\n\n1-4: Ghent with daytrips to Brussels and Bruges\n\n5: check out as late as possible and go to Antwerp (direct train is only an hour), get a drink and people watch the rest of the day. You could also switch hotels at the end of day 4 but imo taking the train in Belgium is quite relaxing so it fits in a slow day. I would not take the train on the morning of day 6 because there\u2019s so much to do in Antwerp you\u2019ll need that full day.\n\n6: visit Antwerp\n\n7: leave for Amsterdam first thing in the morning",

To say it's a border town between Belgium and the Netherlands is rather like saying a tiger is a house cat.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baarle-Nassau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baarle-Nassau)\n\nI used to live in Mechelen, which has a glorious centre, but that's true of many Flemish towns.",

    "postText": "As a preface: I'm wondering if a website or app that lets people post concluding summaries/thoughts of their travel experience would be a good idea. Not a travel blog or journal but just final thoughts and conclusions that are written at the end of the journey. Or maybe this is subreddit is good enough for that sort of thing. But at least it would be more organized and have filters/sort options.\n\n****\nSo I finished 2 weeks of my first trip to Indonesia recently. I jotted down a summary of bullet points on my iPhone in the back of my taxi in Lombok on the way to airport last weekend. Here they are. Note that it leans a little on the romance/women side as I am in my mid-20s and have this sort of thing on my mind a lot.\n****\n* My basic conversational Indonesia language that I learned prior to the trip actually served me very well and opened many doors. I met MANY locals over coffee and chatted. And thankfully there were many who spoke good English so I had free translators along the way.\n* The country is extremely safe and I never felt in trouble. Just always negotiate price (when obvious) or you will get tourist prices.\n* Many motorbikes and scooters, many without helmets, some with 1 mother and 3 children on a single bike.\n* Traffic is wild and honking the horn is its own language with a surprisingly big vocabulary. The center line is only a suggestion. Bikes always interweaving amongst the few cars owned by the more fortunate.\n* Jakarta air quality extremely bad (on some days, the worst in the world). Like smoking a pack of cigarettes per day probably. It\u2019s quite sad.\n* Also, everyone smokes here.\n* Very shocked at the beauty of the local women in Java, Bali and Lombok. I expected to not be attracted to the women mostly because of the hijabs. But not everyone wears it.\n* Traveling here is like being a celebrity and it has my confidence at an all time high. Many women and men call me handsome, they love my blue eyes, and they think I look like different sports athletes like from football or surfing. But I do not want to become a bad person or a play boy or a stupid \"bule\" (foreigner). However it has become somewhat addicting and a social high to walk and meet the people.\n* I ended up meeting about 4 or so different local women who were all very genuine and kind (no, I didn't sleep with all of them). It feels easy to fall in love at age 24... It made me very introspective. Ultimately, I could never live somewhere like Jakarta or similar because of the terrible air quality and because I am not a city person. So, it's no use thinking about meeting a soulmate there I suppose. But I find it very difficult to find anyone attractive in the US locally.\n* Religion is a very large barrier for marriage, thus why bother falling in love anyway when it will likely be a show stopper?\n* It\u2019s also true there are women who may just want sugar daddy or have unrealistic standards such as Korean pop stars, so be careful.\n* Indonesia is quite undeveloped still and education is a problem (not free). Still an early investment opportunity as a whole. But, hotel businesses have already been taken advantage of by foreigners. More transportation is needed in Lombok as Grab/Gojek are not present in a lot of areas. Never pay the outrageous taxi price by resorts or the like.\n* The main sources of income here appear to be farming, warungs (little street-side restaurants), small shops, driving, guiding, and hotels.\n* Food is amazing here and cheap, but the drinks often contain too much sugar. I will miss the great food which makes the US look very boring.\n* Lombok coffee is not too bad. A bold dark roast, with the very fine coffee grinds still present at the bottom of every cup. I still prefer a cup of Geisha or Colombian though.\n* Land is not too expensive here if possible to buy from government. I\u2019m not sure if I would be interested or not to live longer in Lombok like Sembalun (insanely beautiful). Maybe hike the 7 summits one day...\n\nA few landscape images (landscape photography is a passion of mine): https://imgur.com/a/m1P1IqW",

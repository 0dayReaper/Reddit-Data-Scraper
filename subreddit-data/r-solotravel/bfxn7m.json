    "postText": "I\u2019m in Vancouver, Canada. I\u2019m on my second *solo* trip. This went a little differently than I expected. Last month I went to Las Vegas and met someone in line at White Castle. The line was ridiculously long so we got to chatting.. he was from Vancouver and I had a trip planned to go to Vancouver. We joked that I would just crash at his place. We exchanged numbers and have been talking for the last month.\n\n\nAnyway, I did end up staying at his place for my trip. It kinda changed from a solo trip into a friend trip (I\u2019m still considering this solo, similar to couch surfing, I\u2019d say). We went out downtown on Friday and had a fantastic time. Saturday, we drove to Whistler. I WENT BUNGEE JUMPING! I JUMPED OFF OF A BRIDGE! What a rush. I have never felt so terrified and excited. I played the soundtrack to my favorite show on the drive home, sang as loud as I could, and we both had a great time. \n\n\nThe man I was staying with went out of town this morning but let me stay at his place for my last night (SO FRIGGIN NICE). Today was the first day of my little weekend trip that I was actually alone. I slept in, explored Lynn Canyon, and ate dinner at a Chinese restaurant for dinner. I\u2019m currently watching Christopher Robin in the apartment and making cranberry-peanut butter-chocolate bites to leave in his freezer as a \u201cthank you.\u201d\n\n\nI just felt so overwhelmed by how rad life has been and how great this weekend panned out. Two years ago I never would\u2019ve met someone at a freakin\u2019 White Castle and then stay with that person on a trip. I never would\u2019ve even spoken to a stranger. So today, I cried from being happy. Life is good, y\u2019all.",

Then 3 years later out of the blue he calls me up and says he met a Canadian girl and began dating long distance and that he had just landed in Vancouver and was bussing it to Calgary and needed a ride north from there to surprise her. When he arrived at the bus station he ran outside the building and started making snow angels for the first time. \n\nHe knew she was unavailable for a couple of days so I took him to a bachelor party in Banff that I was attending anyways and we had an amazing time. \n\nFast forward to today and he still lives here and married with children.\n\n\u2014\n\nIf you make it to Calgary, feel free to stop in and say \u2018hello\u2019.",

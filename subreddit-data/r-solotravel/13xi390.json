    "postText": "A story about meeting someone while travelling solo, plus I would love it if you tell me some of your thoughts and advice. Thank you so much for reading and sorry in advance if its confusing especially with the timeline. \n\n\\---\n\nBackground information: 27F, been in two long term relationships, both did not work out for many reasons I won't go in to. I am looking for a long term partner to spend my life with. But finding the one that I can connect with on a deep level and has the same values as me has always been hard.\n\n\\---\n\nI was travelling solo in Europe and my final stop was Switzerland for some job interviews before heading home to Australia. I was planning to stay 3 nights in Basel, a couple of nights in a few other cities. I arrived in Basel on Wednesday morning and left on Friday. I was pretty free on Wednesday after touring around the city and decided to download bumble to see how the male population looks like there. Anyway, I was impressed let me say.. I matched with a guy (let's call him Justin), his profile looked cool and he seemed really sweet from the pictures. We talked and instantly hit it off, we had a good conversation that just flowed, although during the conversation he told me that tomorrow he would be travelling somewhere for a couple of days till the following Tuesday. So, I just asked him since this was the only possible night we could meet, if he wanted to have dinner together\\*. He said yes! and we met at the beautiful Rhine and had pizza and wine together. From the minute I saw him I felt: \n\n1. A familiar face, a familiar feeling and a familiar connection (I will come back to this).\n2. I was calm and excited to be with him.\n3. He made me feel safe (sounds silly I know especially because it was our first date, but I cant help how I felt). \n4. Butterflies in my tummy (Great feeling).\n\n*\\*What are the chances that we actually met that night, considering the timing. It just felt like the right time and place...* \n\nWe had a great night and it was really bittersweet, knowing we had a connection out of the world, but also that it was the last time we saw each other. \n\nAnyway, life went on, he travelled and I left Basel on Friday to visit friends in other cities (I was leaving Switzerland the following Thursday). We kept messaging on whatsapp which was nice. Then, for some reason the stars aligned and I got another job interview close to Basel on the following Wednesday, which meant I had to go back to Basel on Tuesday night (the night he got back from his travels) and stay till Thursday (my flight home). I decided to message Justin and ask if he would host me on Tuesday and Wednesday night. Everyone told me I was crazy and that I can't trust someone I just met once, and I fully agree. But, in saying that, I had a strong gut feeling that things will be okay so I went with it. We met again on Tuesday night, and it was really nice seeing him again especially after saying goodbye. He welcomed me and he was a real gentleman, we connected as if we knew each other for years. Anyway, I will spare you the details, except that we had a really nice time together. There were certain moments with him that really felt serene, and I would trade anything to be back in that moment. It's now Thursday, he dropped me to where I needed to go, and we said goodbye. I can't explain how I felt in that moment. Afterall, I was not planning to meet someone on this short trip for job interviews. But I ended up meeting this beautiful kind man. Our connection felt old, like we knew each other somehow and reconnected (its a very strange thing, please help me understand it if you have any advice). \n\n\\*Side note: My job interviews went well, so there is a chance I may actually move there next year (not for sure though). \n\nI am now back in Australia, and me and Justin have been keeping in touch for the last two months since we met, we message and video chat a couple of times per week. I really enjoy chatting to him and he makes me happy. I don't even know what this situation is, but I am just going with the flow for now. Anyway, we were talking and decided to meet up again somewhere in between us, so we decided to travel together to Japan in a couple of months from now. This is where I need some advice. \n\nIs it strange to be travelling with someone that you only met a few times? and by strange, I mean worrying. \n\n1. My gut feeling says it will be okay and that I should do it.\n2. But, I have never done something like this so I really don't know what to think. Plus, all my friends think its a dumb idea... \n3. From my point of view, I just want to see him again and see how we go. \n4. I may be moving to Switzerland for the job, but I am not sure yet. I am worried about forming a deeper connection without knowing for sure where I will be next year. \n\nI don't know if I am going crazy so if you have any advice please let me know! I am really curious to know what you guys think of this as I have never been in this situation before.\n\nThank you lovelies for reading my long post, and looking forward to hearing what you think. \n\nAll the best,\n\nYour reddit solo traveller",

I've definitely left some trips disliking people, for really no fault of their own.\n\nBut realistically what can anyone else tell you about this? You know yourself the best here and i have a feeling you've already made up your mind. If this is something you will forever imagine \"what if\" then you should do it, even if it goes poorly.",

I assume you didn't just randomly apply for jobs in Switserland, so I would guess you may also do that without him. What's the harm in trying. You can always split up in Japan and enjoy the trip solo.\n\nI have spent days travelling with people on very little time. The most notable would be 20 years ago I found a volunteering option, told an aquintance and he asked if he could join. I said sure. Turns out he had a crush and assumed I would do all the shopping (including paying) and cooking for him and it would turn into us dating and lots of sex and babies or something. Naturally he didn't have to put in any effort, stuff like that just happens when two heteros spend time together. He was def barking up the wrong very oblivious queer tree. Telling him to F off a couple times seemed to dissuade him long enough to have a good time. My intuition may have been off about his intentions, but it was fine on him being safe to be around.",

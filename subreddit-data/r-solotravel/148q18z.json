For this lesson, it won't matter too much from whom it happens.  They're all pretty much the same- you'll be on a big foam board and they'll kind of push you into a wave so you can practice the balance of standing.  After that, just go rent the same board or other long board, go to the same spot, and practice popping up in the white water there.  \n\nAs you get consistent with standing on the board, get some private lessons from someone reputable.  Ask around from locals who they would recommend. I always get lessons somewhere new to learn the breaks, best conditions/tides, etc.  Also, in these private lessons you'll learn more about timing, get feedback on your positioning, etc.  Without having experienced friends around to coach you up, these have been so vital for me.  I'll usually take a lesson and then surf on my own for several days.  I'll take another if I feel like I'm stalling, wave conditions are feeling too big, or want to go to a new area. \n\nA lot of people do surf camps too.  If you're really into having a social experience, this is probably the way to go.  Although, I think it's quite a bit more expensive than creating your own experience.   I have heard good things though, and in Nicaragua a lot of people seemed to have enjoyed Dream Surf.  Lots of new surfers in this camp, so you won't feel alone in the process.  \n\nNot sure your budget, but my first surfing experience was nice gentle longboard waves in Maui.  Was such a perfect intro!  Some other spots I've been, I've thought if it had been my first I might have been scared off/too frustrated.  \n\nI hope you pursue it!  It's so fun and rewarding and such a great way to travel!",

My travels started in 1966 with visits to  California as a child with my grandparents.  Every summer after that we traveled to the US West Coast.  My curiosity had me wanting to learn more about AMERICA.  Fast forward to my 20's, I became a Flt Attendant in 1976. My first domicile was NYC. I made it a point to visit ALL 50 US states, which I did.  The airline I worked for expanded to the Far East, Europe and the South Pacific and have traveled around the world many times. I remember traveling to NEW destinations on my days off and would often return to the countries I enjoyed, to spend a month to satisfy my curiosity and learn.  I'm retired now from my employer and still take advantage of my travel benefits to arouse my curiosity and learn.  Safe travels to all!",

At 33 I finally did I went to somewhere like every other year thinking it was really expensive, then after a long term relationship ended I was just like, if I\u2019m going to see and do the things I want I am going to just to go out and do it. I love every aspect of travel from buying the plane tickets, to figuring out what to see, to figuring out where I\u2019m going to go. Getting to the airport in anticipation of the destination. Landing in the new destination and figuring out how and where to go from there. Finally getting into the new city and start exploring. There is a rush to it all that I feel every time I start a new journey. \nI don\u2019t have other single friends that like to travel so going solo was my best option. I have been on a few trips with family and it is not the same. Not bad, but solo is better, for me.",

There are so many ways of living in this world and to see it for yourself is priceless. Secondly, self-discovery. I think when you are in the monotony of your everyday life, it's about like tunnel vision.. its hard to see things clear. By leaving your comforts of home, you get to see yourself within a new context which can be very illuminating. Lately, I'm in the work to live camp.

E.g. the delicious food, excellent public transit, and general feeling of safety and security in Japanese cities.\n\nAlso, navigating countries where I can't speak or read the language, reminds me to be more empathetic to non-English speakers back in the US.  (Obviously this was even bigger pre-smartphone.)",

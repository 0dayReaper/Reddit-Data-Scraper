    "postText": "Can I get some criticism on my itinerary? I know 3 days is a long time in Cesky Krumlov, but I'm completely ok with that. Not sure if it's a mistake to end my trip in Prague rather than start it there. I'm ending there because I don't want to spend the day before I leave traveling from Mikulov to Prague. Feels almost like a wasted day. Also Cesky Krumlov seems like a better place to relax and get over jet lag.\n\nDay A - Outbound Flight (1/2)\n\nDay B - Outbound Flight and Arrival (2/2)\nSleep in Prague\n\nDay 1 - Cesky Krumlov (1/3)\n\nPublic transportation to get to CK\n\nDay 2 - Cesky Krumlov (2/3)\n\nDay 3 - Cesky Krumlov (3/3)\n\nDay 4 - Trebon &amp; Telc\n\nPublic transportation to Trebon then Telc\n\nDay 5 - Trebic &amp; Brno\n\nPublic transportation to Trebic then Brno and lastly Mikulov to sleep\n\nDay 6 - Mikulov (1/2)\n\nDay 7 - Mikulov (2/2)\n\nDay 8 - Prague (1/5)\n\nDay 9 - Prague (2/5)\n\nDay 10 - Prague (3/5)\n\nDay 11 - Prague (4/5)\n\nDay 12 - Prague (5/5)\n\nDay C - Return Flight",

            "comment": "Uhhh... this would basically destroy the composition of your initiary completely, but I dont at all get the appeal of Krumlov, it more or less feels like a smaller Prague, so generally I would recommend people to avoid it, especially since its so far of the  center of the country. I guess its fine for a few days of relaxation though.\n\nImo the second best city in Cze is Olomouc, so I would generally suggest that",

I don\u2019t like your idea of doing two cities in one day though they are smaller. 1 day in Krumlov is more than fine, you\u2019ll get some actual Czech culture if U do a day in T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d lr Tel\u010d, Sam\u00e9 f\u00f3r Brno, idk how U can spend half a day there\u2026 But I think starting in Krumlov and ending in Prague is the way to go",

I'm only considering doing anything in Brno because that's usually where you have to stop before Mikulov. Initially, I didn't even consider stopping there. I really want to spend the 3 days in Krumlov. I wanna memorize the layout of the city and get into a mini routine. If I feel done on day 2, I'll leave early, but I don't think I will be. Relaxing is my number 1 priority.",

            "comment": "The cities you picked are really great but I have a few suggestions that could help you enjoy your trip more. Starting your trip in \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov and ending in Prague makes sense. But day 4 and 5 are really hectic so you would end up with only a few hours in that cities before rushing for the transportation. I would suggest cutting the third day in Cesky Krumlov toward spending a full day in some other city. From my experience you can get around Cesky Krumlov in a day. In Tel\u010d And T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d there is small historic city center so half day is kinda okay for each and the bus connection between them takes approx an hour, so maybe I would put these two together in a day. And for Brno whole day should be enough to get an idea of the feel of the city. That night in Milkulov is a great opportunity to visit tradition wine cellar which is a must when visiting South Moravia. \n\nSo my suggestion is spending the third day in T\u0159ebo\u0148 (either get there second day evening or third day morning) and travelling on that day to Tel\u010d so you can start exploring Tel\u010d on fourth day morning before hopping on a bus to T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d spending the afternoon of day four there. And from T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d I would take one of the evening trains to Brno ( takes about 1,5 hours) where I would spend day five and then carry with the rest of the itinerary. \n\nMaybe you can even cut yours five days in Prague to four and spending the time between the smaller cities so you can relax more the days before. \n\nAlso pay attention to the weekdays when you will be visiting, some of the Czech sights have closing days on Monday so it is important to check before your visit if it is open or not. \n\nEnjoy your trip, Czech republic is amazing place!",

My gut is still telling me that I should take those 3 days in cesky krumlov, but I intend to be flexible when I get to czechia. Worst case, I don't spend any time in Brno, which is low on my priority list anyway. But if I do decide last minute I want to stay there I'm OK with eating into my time in Prague. \n\nHow do I go about finding a wine cellar by Mikulov?",

Wine cellars in Mikulov are really common but not all of them are English friendly, so Google will give you better recommendations so you could enjoy the most of your stay.",

            "comment": "I'd split my Prague days to do two sightseeing days at the start and two at the end.  That way, if you feel like you don't need two full days at the end, you can always take a later bus or train into Prague and spend an extra half day somewhere else.\n\nTo me, 3 night stays are good as long as you have a plan for a day trip for the middle day (which is fungible if you have bad weather).  There is wear and tear from moving, and I always found that there is far less wear and tear from picking up some breakfast and eating it on a train for 60-90 minutes to do a day trip somewhere else, and then a beverage or three for the train ride back at night.",

Help create an inclusive environment: r/solotravel has a zero-tolerance policy towards racism, sexism, bigotry, homophobia, harassment and gatekeeping. Rule-breaking posts and comments will be removed and repeat offenders may be banned. Posting about sex tourism is not permitted and is an immediately bannable offence.

Please search before posting.: Chances are someone's asked your question before. Repetitive questions will be removed.

No self-promotional content.: Links to blogs/vlogs, clickbait, surveys, fundraising campaigns, or self-promotional content will be removed. However, you can post it in the "General Chatter" thread.

No pure image/video posts, polls, or standalone external links: Pure image/video posts, polls, and standalone external links will be removed. However, we encourage photos in Trip Reports!

For visa questions, always include your citizenship.

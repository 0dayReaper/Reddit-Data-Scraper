    "postText": "Hello all, I (23M) recently came across a post here talking about more than a few sexual assaults in one of the hostels that the OP was staying in and got me thinking what are some basic TO DO and NOT TO DO men can do that can keep yourself and others safe and have a pleasant experience for all. Will be having my first solo bagpacking trip end of June and would like to educate myself beforehand.  Would like to hear from both men's and women's point of view",

I do think there are inadvertent (sometimes cultural) differences that can seem creepy.\n\nFor example, I\u2019m Indian and culturally it is normal for people in India to look at others a bit longer than what would be \u2018normal\u2019. Not talking about the obvious creeps (there are tons), but in general holding eye contact on the street isn\u2019t viewed as crazy. I\u2019ve learned (not through bad experiences, but through reading) that this can make people uncomfortable in different cultures. \n\nIt\u2019s something I actively avoid. So I don\u2019t think the person asking the question is wrong to ask it, and there are multiple unintentional behaviours that us men can avoid to help make women feel safer.",

Approaching a crush when they come back to the hostel could be creepy or flirting. OP, the key is noticing how the other person reacts. If they don't look you in the eye, don't ever approach you first, or don't seem to want to talk, leave them alone. Kind of like another guy. If they're acting unfriendly, they don't want to talk. Insisting is creepy. In a shared room situation, keep your eyes averted unless the person is addressing you or there is general conversation, don't comment on something a person isn't discussing with you (for example, \"you really like doing your eye makeup!\" or \"wow, you have many pairs of shoes\"). I always hate when people I don't like comment on what I'm doing since i think it implies judgment. Do your own thing but be open to genuine conversation without assuming it will lead to something sexual (*that's* creepy).",

I completely understand where the commentor is coming from. Staring at others and holding eye contact is the norm for them but completely the un norm for us unless it's done in a flirtatious or friendly manner. And it is creepy and scary as hell (like nightmarish) when a very dark Indian in the middle of the night keeps staring at you as you walk past them. Their eyes are extremely white so they end up looking like a ghost (in my opinion). I have many other Indian friends and not all are like that. Its just those whom aren't good or familiar with our culture yet I believe.\n\nPlus, it also the norm in their culture in India to assault women very young. Most people don't do anything about it though times are changing there too. Albeit slowly. That's why it's also pretty common for Chinese young women (below 18) to actually encounter sexual assault/harassment by older Indian men from India (not the ones born in SG tho)\n\nSo yes, staring too hard and too long is indeed considered a form of sexual assault here for the younger women. Because it does signify something uncomfortable is gonna happen. That's why we all actively avoid the eyes of such men. And it isn't just Chinese young women. Its all races. That are women. Literally. At least high value women do. Otherwise they think we're interested in something more if one is being friendly.",

The only exception I make to this rule is if they engage with me first. If someone looks up from their phone/book/tablet, makes eye contact and starts a conversation, that's a pretty clear indicator that A) they feel relatively safe with your presence and B) they're interested in being social. \n\nAlso, read the room. If someone has headphones on, that's the international symbol for 'I don't feel like talking.' If she's getting changed or they're fresh outta the shower, turn around or step out if you're not doing anything urgent.\n\nI've been in hostel rooms where grown ass man-children have talked about what they would do with this girl or that girl while they're literally sleeping 2 feet away (these were two Canadian men both 45+). Don't fuckin do that. It's not a locker room, it's a shared living space. \n\nLastly and definitely not least. If you see someone being assaulted, intervene as violently as you can. Worry about the rest later. It's SO common in hostels because these guys think it's a safe space to be a predator. That shit stops when they become the prey.",

Think about what questions might make someone uncomfortable (specific personal questions, asking for a lot of detail about their next plans). It\u2019s one thing to say \u201cOh, I\u2019ve been to XYZ, I really liked (museum, bar, whatever).\u201d It\u2019s another to press for details. A no is a no \u2014 not just in sexual/romantic situations, but if you invite someone to a conversation or to go do something with you, don\u2019t keep engaging if they don\u2019t want to. A lot of people traveling want to share stories or spend a little time with other travelers, so it\u2019s not wrong to leave that on the table, but listen to them when they decline or seem hesitant (verbally or with body language). In my opinion, it\u2019s always better to open your plans to others rather than lock onto theirs (\u201cI\u2019m going to ABC Museum tomorrow if you\u2019d like to join,\u201dand then *drop it* if they say no). They can always ask to join later if they change their mind. The fact that you asked this question makes me think you\u2019re already self-aware and considering others\u2019 comfort, so I\u2019m sure you already know that but it is worth emphasizing. In terms of actual assault, which I think is your real question, please, please, please intervene. Depending on the situation, you might engage the aggressor or the victim (for lack of a better word). You can also alert the hostel if the situation is escalating. You might not do it \u201cperfectly\u201d but almost anything is better than doing nothing.",

Because it's a pretty simple and generally applicable rule. Treat others as you would want them to treat you. Don't do anything to anybody that you wouldn't want someone to do to you. Although it sometimes seems so lacking, It's really not much more complicated than being considerate and empathetic to others, and showing them the same common courtesy that you would hope to be treated with yourself, and that we'd all be better off were we to all practice it.",

If you need to be told it's wrong to sexually assault others, and what you can get away with as long as you follow the rules, maybe you shouldn't be around other people. If I'm being honest, I tried to be polite to begin with, but if you're really confused about how to not accidentally sexually assault another person, then what is it going to matter where you do it. Just don't do that to anybody, anywhere. What rules do you need to help you with that? Just don't do it anywhere. Why do you need to be told that? It doesn't matter if it's written, un written, in a hostel, on the street, in about with a fox. Why is this confusing to you? Because it's a problem that it is. Here's the rulebook for you personally, if you ever feel like sexually assaulting somebody else, regardless of where you are, tap yourself on the thigh five times and repeat to yourself, \"I will not sexually assault another person.\" repeatedly, and remove yourself from other people as quickly as possible. Then when you're alone, take a deep breath, and then kill yourself. The fact that you needed advice on this to begin with, and then when people gave you the benefit of the doubt, and you still needed futher clarification on how to behave around other people, is probably a sign that you don't belong around other people, and are probably a danger to them. If you needed special rules other than just don't sexually assault somebody, to stop you from sexually assaulting somebody, then you have serious problems that need to be addressed, and you not existing anymore is one that probably wouldn't bother me.",

I initially started that if that's a thing that you'd never think to do, then you probably don't have to much to worry about. You just have to continue not doing it. The fact that you were dismissive of that like you needed more specific rules to follow gave me a very different impression.

    "postText": "Using a throwaway, since I've reported this to the airline staff, and told some friends as well, haha.\n\n---\n\nI was flying home yesterday and I got seated next to a couple with an excessive amount of PDA-- I'm talking making out, stroking, moaning, etc. It was like there was no situational awareness at all, like those economy seats were their bedroom. I personally don't care if a couple is passionate, but it felt super uncomfortable being in so close proximity with no personal bubble or buffer. It was a full flight too, and even with babies crying left and right, and people walking up and down the aisle constantly, they kept at it for the 4 hour flight.\n\n**And then the handjob started.**\n\nI was tolerating the constant PDA for an hour or so by distracting myself (noise-cancelling headphones, reading, etc), but then the girl took out a blanket, and I notice her hand go in his pants.\n\nNope nope nope.\n\nI had scoped out an empty seat on the way to the washroom a few minutes ago, so I went back there, asked the guy next to it if anyone was sitting there, he said no, I told him I'm moving there and he was thankfully non-confrontational about it.\n\nI didn't bother asking for permission, I quickly grabbed my stuff at the original seat (guy was now moaning hard, ugh), and I went to that empty seat. I thanked my new seat neighbours, and told them the people up there were making me uncomfortable.\n\nI'm so thankful there was at least one empty seat to be in, I can't imagine what would have happened if I was stuck in that seat. I didn't want to cause a scene, it was really, *really* awkward.\n\nWhen the flght ended, I pulled a flight attendent aside and told him about my seat change, and he was really apologetic and told me that I handled the situation correctly, but to also let us know if something like that happens again. He grabbed my info and said he was going to send some credits along my way and look the other people up. I let him know I wasn't looking for compensation, but thanked him anyway. I was mainly letting them know for the reason of my seat swap (and also for sanitization, heh).\n\nNo real question or lesson here, but I wanted to share the experience. I know weird stuff happens in hostels all the time, but flights are usually 'safe' for the most part, so it really wasn't something I was expecting to happen.\n\nOh, and this was in a small plane with a domestic flight in Canada. I won't name the airline, because they really weren't at fault here, and the flight attendant sincerely apologized many times that I went through that. \n\nBy the end I was able to laugh about it, I'm just hoping I can block that out of my mind after a while though, haha\n\n**Edit:** The number of folks that think I'm making this up is insane. It happened. Sorry I didn't handle it the best way. It wasn't a situation I had ever dealt with before.\n\n**Edit 2:** Thank you so much to the more empathetic users that have posted on here since. Your support has meant a lot!",

I was seated next to a teen boy and girl (I was in the aisle seat). (Me at the time-22F). They were making out pretty hardcore once the cabin lights were dimmed. But then the blanket came out and they were going to town on each other with their hands. A flight attendant walked by and made a face of disgust but just ignored it (it was Emirates so I figured she would have asked them to stop\u2026)\n\nAnyways, I tried to just ignore them and watch my movie (I hate confrontation). but I had been awake for 48 hours straight and was borderline delirious, and I can\u2019t sleep on planes. So, I just tapped the guy on the shoulder and asked him \u201cwould you do this in front of your mother? Pretend I\u2019m your mother sitting right here, have some respect for people around you.\u201d He looked so embarrassed and just nodded silently.\n\nThe two of them sat the rest of the flight with their hands on their lap just facing forward\u2026 not even watching tv. I speak Spanish so I kept an ear out to see if they were talking shit about me but they didn\u2019t say a word. It really was surprising to me because as an American I expected them to tell me to fuck off\u2026 but yeah I was glad I said something, hopefully they remembered that lesson",

I don't know why people still fly it when there are so many better options and more surprisingly, why people still consider it a good airline \"Oh it was Emirates so maybe it was a rare occurrence that they were bad\". No, Emirates being a good occurrence is what is rare these days. They've also been accused of racism several times, even publicly but they haven't done anything about it.",

The flight staff drill into us (the pax) that acting in any way emotionally or physically is a big no no, and you need to prevent or distance yourself from anything like that before you do anything else. I would do exactly the same as you did - get away from the gross situation and speak with an attendant later. Causing a scene in the air is an absurd reaction when nobody is actually in danger if you let those horrible people do their thing.",

Fight, flight, freeze, or fawn is a real thing and none of us knows what our nervous system will chose until we\u2019re in a situation. For instance, I was groped in a shared uber. The driver was right there, I could have said something to her. I could have yelled at the guy. I honestly don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t do either of those things. All I did was scoot as far away from the guy as possible and pray for the ride to be over soon. This happened years ago and it still makes no sense to me. I could have stopped the discomfort, but my nervous system chose to do nothing but try to scoot away.

I'm a guy and must have been 14-15 and was travelling in a metro. It was peak hours and there was a mad rush. I was standing next to a guy who was eyeing me in a rather odd way. Suddenly, I could feel his hands down there and he moved his fingers over my private part. I froze and could see he was smiling. I turned around and just stood there, unable to understand what just happened. I have never shared this with anyone, but just saying that these things happen.

To my right was a snippy young woman who insisted immediately that she did not want to be touched (a complication considering she had the window seat and would need to use the bathroom several times and would scream and flinch away from anyone who brushed against her). On my left, a hyper-flamboyant gay man; I didn\u2019t assume this about him, he told me much about himself during our long journey. He was also very touchy, and had initially had the middle seat - but I foresaw complications immediately and offered him my aisle seat to give window lady some space. \n\nOver the next ten hours, I learned about Gay Man\u2019s entire family (who were all also gay), his entire sexual history (with intimate detail), his gay brother\u2019s entire sexual history, the BDSM scene in Japan, how gay Japanese men differed from gay American men in bed, etc. At this point Window Lady had had enough and proclaimed that she had been SA\u2019d, and lectured him on consent and bedroom safety. The next two hours consisted of a debate about whether Gay Man had practiced safe bedroom practices during his past escapades - at this point I was starting to hardcore zone out and play Alchemy on the screen. \n\nThe final hour of the flight, we were all too physically and emotionally exhausted to speak and the three of us played a crossword together on my screen in silence. Can\u2019t believe I made that entire flight sober, I felt changed after that\u2026",

    "postText": "I have a shengen visa ending mid-November that I haven\u2019t used yet (my family had applied to visit family but due to unforeseen reasons we were not able to go). I have some money saved up for a trip and I would really like to make use of it before it runs out. I was thinking a 7-10 day trip in September or October.\n\nI really like the idea of hiking and adventure trips, especially since where I come from we don\u2019t have forests or trees that turn orange, ponds, acorns or mushrooms not packed in a supermarket (I live in a city near a coastal area). Same thing for snow! So a fairytale-like landscape would be ideal.\n\nI also love fun and interactive destinations, so things that include activities like  painting holidays, walking tours, workshops, folkloric traditions, festivals, or even things like renaissance fairs or LARPing! Still, getting to explore museums at my own leisure would also be a big plus travelling solo, so I would not say no to that as well. I really enjoy snorkelling as well, but I think the water would be too cold in September? And besides, we have beaches!\n\nI have lived in Paris and have been to Amsterdam before (although admittedly I did not get to stay more than two days in the latter and the third in Efteling). I know in the Netherlands there is a fantasy fair some time in September, so that is one option, but I would like to hear other suggestions if possible. I plan to stay at hostels and my while I want to try local food, I don\u2019t plan on doing any fine dining (most of my money will be spent on activities, transportation and souvenirs).\n\nI speak English and French, and a kindergarten level of German if that helps.\n\nDon\u2019t know if these are factors as well, but I am female, and I do not drink. My budget is about 1000\u20ac. Any suggestions (and even some advice) would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "I'd highly recommend Slovenia. It was my favourite country in Europe - huge variety of landscapes and activities, but small and easy to get around, very safe, and a fair bit cheaper than western Europe.\n\nBased on your interests, I suggest you look up a few days in the capital, Ljubljana. It's one of the prettiest cities in Europe, and has many lovely cafes, galleries, and small museums to explore (in addition to lots of pretty old buildings and a hilltop castle). There's also an open air market in the town square that while not 'carnival-like', does have a lovely, authentic celebratory feel to it. \n\nOutside of Ljubljana, your best bet would be Lake Bled. It's postcard perfect with its island church and clifftop castle giving it a very fairytale vibe. Its also is a good base for kayaking, camping, hiking, mountain biking etc. The trip out to Vintgar Gorge is especially nice, and you'll easily find lots of fall colours in the alpine forests here. You can also use Bled as a toehold from which to head up for more serious hikes in the Julian Alps. \n\nA stop at Postojna would allow you to visit another castle and a touristy but fun tour through a famous cave (there are options for serious caving too - Slovenia is arguably Europe's caving capital). \n\nA last stop at Piran will allow you to see a Venetian-style harbour town without the crowds. Elsewhere, you can also find vineyards.\n\nGetting around Slovenia is easy by trains and buses - things are very well organized and punctual. Most people can speak English reasonably well too. If you'd like, you can string Slovenia together with some time in a nearby larger city like Vienna, Budapest, or Venice - but ideally, give the country time!",

To be doubly sure, you can check once at the tourist info centre and the Ljubljana train/bus stations (both are next to each other) once you get there since post-summer vacation schedules may be sparser.",

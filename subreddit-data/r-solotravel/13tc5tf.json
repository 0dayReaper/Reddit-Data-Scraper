    "postText": "I (28M) am planning my first solo trip along the pacific highway 1. Thought it\u2019s a mix of scenic route plus city life so I can get used to traveling alone. Here\u2019s the rough plan-\nStart in San Francisco and drive to San Diego with stops in Monterey and Santa Barbara. \nDay 1- SF highlights (Golden gate bridge, palace of fine arts, Lombard street, pier39), half moon bay, pebble beach and end the day in Carmel by the sea.\nDay 2- Big Sur (point lobos, bixby bridge, pfeiffer beach, morro rock) and stay in Santa Barbara. I realized the Big Sur to Santa Barbara portion is closed for repairs so this drive is going to be a long detour via Carmel. \nDay 3 - LA (Malibu, HW sign, HW walk of fame, Griffith observatory, Venice beach for sunset). Continue to San Diego. Saw they have HW city tour in LA. worth it? Any recommendations?\nDay 4 - Balboa park, La Jolla, Coronado island. Have friends in San Diego so should be easier I guess. \n\nI know it\u2019s a short duration too many things trip but that\u2019s all the holidays I had and wanted to still go experience solo travel. Planning to stay in hostel jn SF but didn\u2019t find any hostels elsewhere so probably will book hotels. Also this is going to be the July 4 weekend so I am expecting a big rush. \n\nSuggestions, tips, safety issues in city(have heard of car theft and mugging in SF) or anything else I should add to my plan please. \n\nThanks!",

I stayed on Hollywood Blvd my first trip to LA and was turned off on the city for a long time after that. \n\nAlso all of that in one day in LA is ambitious. \n\nDon\u2019t park and leave your rental in SF. Stay the night and then pick up the car on your way out. Muggings aren\u2019t as big a deal but to be extra safe don\u2019t walk around with earbuds",

Hearst Castle and the elephant seal colony are both highlights. \n\nAlso, be careful about your speed. There are often speed traps set up in various otherwise empty stretches of the PCH. And they will nail you for less than 5mph over, because they don't expect you'll come back up to the area to fight the ticket. Only place I've ever gotten a ticket (which was BS, because I had my cruise control set at the speed limit. So at most I was a mile or two over.)\n\nYour day three may be too ambitious. Even if you were already in the LA area, traffic and distances will make it hard to get all those destinations in on just one day and actually have time to enjoy any of it.  Without traffic, you're looking at an hour drive between Malibu and Hollywood.  Expect another half hour minimum between Hollywood and Griffith Park. An hour or more between there and Venice.   And all of these times may double or triple on a weekday with traffic.  Also factor in extra time for parking, as you may have trouble finding spots at places like Malibu or Griffith Park depending on the day and might have to hoof it a ways. And if you're coming from Santa Barbara that morning, you'll be spending another couple hours on the road.   Then you're then driving to San Diego and that's another 3-4 hours on the road. \n\nThat's a pretty intense day. I'd recommend splitting it into two days, honestly. Allow yourself more time to enjoy the sights and not spend your day miserable in endless traffic.\n\nEdit:  San Simeon, not San Luis Obispo",

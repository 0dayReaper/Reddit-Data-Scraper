Hoping to leave early in the morning, at like 7am. \n\nAlso, it looks like Ubers from the airport to Antigua cost around $30-$40 now? can anyone confirm? Thanks in advance!",

That was last year so I don\u2019t remember the exact amount but I took it from Antigua to San Pedro, they stopped in panajachel to drop some people off.",

This last time, i walked up to one of those shuttle booths right before the exit to the airport and just paid $15 , worked out perfectly fine.\n\nMost shuttles are reliable going to Pana. Its one of the most common routes, walk into any hostel and just book it. I always go to Tropicana because its the one close to my hotel and price is usually cheaper than most. Including guatego.",

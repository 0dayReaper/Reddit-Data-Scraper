    "postText": "A week into my first solo, and I just wanted to post in case there are any other first timers out there reading this that might be going through it after diving in.\n\nThe first day of the trip hit me like a truck. I think a combination of jet lag, anxiety, exhaustion, and \u201cwhat the fuck am I doing here?\u201d Got me pretty good. The panic and anxiety were tough. I think at one point I literally just found a nice park, laid in the grass and did some deep breathing to try and pace myself. All those thoughts of how to get home and what my emergency exits were didn\u2019t exactly inspire confidence.\n\nThose feelings lingered but over the next few days were overtaken by excitement amazement and comfort as I settled into my itinerary.\n\nA week into my trip I couldn\u2019t be happier with the sights I\u2019ve seen and the friends I\u2019ve made. I knew it was worth sticking out through it, based on the advice I\u2019ve received from other travelers, but I thought I would pass that on to anyone that might be reading.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this, and it\u2019s going to be fantastic!\n\nSending good vibes to anyone reading and good luck on your journey!",

If you travel because you think you will always meet great people, honestly that may not happen. Travel because you want to see other countries. A romance and friendship is just a bonus.",

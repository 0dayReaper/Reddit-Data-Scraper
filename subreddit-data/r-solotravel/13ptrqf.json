    "postText": "I'm planning a solo trip to Europe next summer (May, June, July) and want to hammer out my itinerary early! I'm planning on flying into Edinburgh from Montreal, Canada, and flying back to Montreal from Germany/wherever I end up. I'd like ideas around experiencing **nature** (without a car - I can't drive) and **local culture (local shops, small restaurants, history, etc)**. Since the trip is so long, **I want to take things slow. Does my itinerary reflect this, or should I give myself more time?**\n\n***UK:***\n\nEdinburgh: 4 days \n\nHadrian's Wall: 1 day \n\nBath: 1 day \n\nLondon: 10 days \n\n***France:*** \n\nD-Day beaches: 1 day \n\nParis: 10 days, including 1 day trip to Versaille \n\nMarseille: 3 days \n\nNice: 3 days \n\nFrench Alps: 5 days \n\n***Belgium:***\n\nBruges: 4 days, including 1 day trip to Ypres \n\nGhent: 2 days \n\nBrussels: 8 days, including 1 day trip to Waterloo \n\nAntwerp: 3 days \n\n***Netherlands:***\n\nAmsterdam: 10 days, including day trips to Rotterdam and potentially Zaanse Schans, Gielthoorn, Utrecht, or Den Burg \n\n***Germany:*** \n\nDresden: 3 days \n\n(villages/towns near the) Black Forest: 4 days \n\nPotentially Nuremburg, Cologne, and Frankfurt as well \n\n**This only adds up to 72 days and I can stay for 85** (want to give myself wiggle room with the 90 days I'm allowed to stay visa-free) **- should I spend more time in each location, add more locations, or save it for inter-city/country train travel time?** \n\n**Also,** **do you think a 3-month Eurail pass is worth it?** I'm a planner, but I don't want to plan things down to the last detail, so if I don't get the pass, I will be buying flexible, most likely 1st class train tickets. \n\nI'm spending 12 days in Munich and Berlin this June with my partner, which will be my first time to Europe. That's also why those two cities aren't on the itinerary. I'm planning a future (next few years) trip to Italy with a friend, so I'd like to save it for then. **Thank you so much if you read through all of that, and thanks in advance for any advice!**",

            "comment": "\"I'd like ideas around experiencing nature (without a car - I can't drive)...\"\n\nSounds like you haven't been to Europe before... Missing out on nature Scotland has to offer.  Maybe take two days off of London and go to Oban.  I just Googled \"edinburgh to oban\".  Five hour train ride starting at around $21 USD sounds reasonable.\n\n[https://www.raileurope.com/en-us/destinations/edinburgh-oban-train](https://www.raileurope.com/en-us/destinations/edinburgh-oban-train)\n\nOr book a day trip to from Edinburgh to Oban and Highlands.  Also worth a half day trip to Stirling and Stirling Castle if you're into history.  Can get there from Edinburgh in about an hour or less via train.\n\nHaving been to many of the places on your list... I'd regret not spending more time in Scotland.  I wouldn't extend the trip beyond 72 days.  What I'd do instead is reallocate a day each from London and Paris.  Same thing for Brussels except I'd make the stay there 6 days.\n\nBath... not sure if you mean to stay one night there... might be easier to add that day to London and to day trip to Bath.  Unless you're really into Jane Austen (and who isn't?) not sure if it's worth stopping there on the way to London.\n\nEven if it's one's first trip to London and Paris... 9-10 days... \n\nMaybe take a day from Paris and Marseille and try to make day trips to Avignon and Arles.\n\nAgain wouldn't extend the trip.  The most I would do in London and Paris is 7 days each.  Most I'd do in Brussels is 3-4 days.  However with Brussels... it's so easy to do day trip to the other places in BE, can stay longer in Brussels and not have to move your base as much.  Just think... your train to Brussels arrives at 11am but you can't check in until 2pm.  Moving bases a lot in BE might not be worth it.",

Fantastic city!\n\n\nHadrians Wall to Bath via public transport is going to take you the best part of a day, so consider whether that little section might be too rushed. \n\n\nI\u2019d leave out Frankfurt from your Germany itinerary tbh. If you\u2019re visiting Munich beforehand, Nuremberg may be a bit too similar. Hamburg is a cool alternative to mix things a bit. \n\n\nYou\u2019ve definitely got the right idea however, by leaving yourself plenty of time and not rushing around too much. Public transport in Europe generally is very good but you\u2019ll still be at the mercy of delays, missed connections and strikes. \n\n\nEnjoy!",

            "comment": "Usually people here are blitzkrieging their itinerary and trying to see 10 countries in two weeks. You're the opposite, and spending way too much time in some places. \n\nYou do not need that much time in Brussels or Bruges. I would spend maybe 3 days in Brussels and 2 in Bruges. You might also consider taking some time to visit some of the smaller towns in Wallonia to get a sense of both sides of Belgium. \n\nI love Paris, but I would take 3-4 days off Paris and add it elsewhere, like Normandy. Doing just one day to the D-Day beaches is doing it a disservice. I would do 2 nights each in Rouen and Bayeux. Both have a lot of history and things to see, and you can see the D-Day beaches easily from Bayeux.  \n\nInstead of Marseilles, I would choose a smaller town in Provence, such as Avignon or Arles. \n\nI would consider splitting up your time in the Netherlands as well. I think The Hague is a nice place to spend a few days. Good food, museums, interesting architecture, and the same stuff is legal there, just on a much smaller scale. It's also not overrun with tourists. \n\nWith the extra time you have, if you haven't been to Italy I would add it. You could do Rome, Florence, Venice, and either the north or go south to Naples and the Amalfi Coast.",

            "comment": "Great idea to take it easy. You mention nature, however, most of your stays are in cities. So some suggestions.\n\nTake more time in Scotland, it is stunning. There are multi day tours you could take, but taking public transport is also an option. I know several of the touring companies if you want more info. In general, check out the Scottish Isles, they are all different and gorgeous, most people go to Skye, but unless you go there before the busy season, go to others. I have traveled there quite a bit, so I have suggestions.\n\nYou could consider taking a ferry from Scotland to Ireland and then back through Wales to hit up more nature. I would do Giants Causeway, County Donegal (Dooey hostel at Glencolumbkille was amazing 20 years ago), Doolin and walking up to the cliffs of Moher, Dingle Peninsula, Ring of Kerry, over to Wales for Snowdonia and Conwy Castle and check out Chester when you cross the border into England.\n\nThe Netherlands is limited on nature as it is densly populated and if it isn't built on, it is a lot of agricultural land. There are definitely places and pockets, but it will be a trip from Amsterdam. You may like Kinderdijk to see the mills tho, which should still be doable from Utrecht (which is a lovely city) Busses go everywhere. Rotterdam is modern buildings, because it was bombed in WW2, most people want the older cities, but it would be a different experience.\n\nBelgium, you can see Brussels in 1-2 days, same for bruges. Dinant would be close to river, canoeing, a fortress and caves, I had a bike when I was there, can't remember walkability, but a bike may be nice.\n\nIt may also make more sense to head for Switserland and Austria and skip NL and BE.\n\nGermany: Cologne and Frankfurt are close together and very different. In Frankfurt check out the harbour with modern art. In Cologne, if you like interwar art go to the Kathe Kollwitz Museum, bring tissues. I would do 2 days for cologne, 1 for frankfurt, which could be a day trip. You don't have Berlin on your list, I found it historically and architecturally very interesting, and as you are planning on Versailles, you may like Potsdam (easily reached by tram from Berlin) for a day of castles and so in a beautiful park.\n\nFinally the eurrail, I had a look at these,I would suggest looking at your itinerary first and checking out train prices for the long and short journeys (can be booked online) early booking usually pays off, it gives you freedom to have the eurrail, but I am not sure unlimited for 3 months makes sense on your itinerary as you currently plan to stay in one place for longer stretches. For some of the options I and others have given above you will likely be on busses, the more limited days for 1-2 months may end up cheaper. If you are going to be doing greater distances and will be moving around the countries by train a bit more, it may make sense. All that said, damn they are good value compared to what us Europeans get, I remembered them as rather expensive, and for Europeans they are double the price.",

That being said, it all depends on what you want to do. Any sights to see? Rest days? To have the time and space to do whatever you want? I know many on this sub value time in one destination, but I would personally cut some of the days to explore more of Europe, like Poland.",

Leuven, which is outside Brussels is an easy day trip.\n\nI think you could add a day to Bath and or add in Bristol as they are close to each other and there is a very different atmosphere and culture in Bristol to Bath. \n\nIf you go to Vienna, take the train and do 3 days in Prague. Budapest is also a cool city if you go in the other direction. All 3 have similarities architecturally from being in the Austro-Hungarian empire, and Prague and Budapest from their post WW2 Soviet era.",

    "postText": "This is just a perspective I've noticed more recently, that sometimes really breaks me. \n\nThis is my third-year solo traveling, I started with a week in Europe in 2019, to 6 weeks in the States in 2021, and  10 weeks across Canada in 2022. \n\nI met a lot of fun people, from all across the world, living in hostels.   \nAnd now I'm back to my home in Toronto.   \n\n\nAnd as I talk to people here of any generation, it's terrifyingly scary how much of a bubble they're in and the lengths they'd go to defend it.   \nPeople who have never left their hometown, and get all their social insights from Tiktok, reddit, Twitter, are extremely confident about things they have never experienced.   \n\n\nThey take issues that bother them and escalate them to such a large point, but they haven't done any work to actually see how these issues are impacting the real world. They think that because they are older, or because they are on social media, they become the go-to for something. \n\n  \nAs a traveler, as you meet more people, most of whom are open-minded, you slowly realize that we all have our struggles and we all want the same things. Its rare to have your struggles overlap with someone else, and its irrational to except others to care about your issues to the level you do. \n\n  \nLets take cultural appropriation, which is a pretty serious topic of contention here in North America.  Now, I grew up in India, where a concept like this was never really addressed. We have many different cultures in India, and I saw them shared across the country.   \n\n\nIf you're a North Indian, going to a South Indian wedding, it wasn't considered a crime to dress up in their culture. Something like that wasn't even thought of, because there are bigger things to worry about than who is dressing up as whom.   \n\n\nIn North America (Canada and US), its seen from such a negative viewpoint. Now obviously, there are examples of some racists who just want to make a mockery of cultures. Those are exceptions.    \nBut for the most part, I feel like I would want to embody parts of a culture as I learn about it, and come from a place of respect.   \nBut you can't expect me to instantly know about all this, because I come from a place where this wasn't ever discussed.  \n\n\nExpecting someone to care about what you care about is ridiculous. Solo Travel showed me that - people have been raised and go through different lifes. And sometimes thee issues you're passionate about, are just not going to be reciprocated with other, and you learn to accept it and move on.   \n\n\nBut then,  you interact with others in your hometown, who don't have this notion of acceptance.  For them, its like, \"if you don't support what I'm supporting, then you're a piece of shit.\"   \n\n\nAnd I just feel like a lot of times, the loudest voices are from those who don't travel, because they feel they need to be heard. But they don't have the exposure or experience that makes their viewpoint worth considering, because the world at large is not on the same page with them.  \n\n\nI hope I made sense here, and I was wondering if other solo travellers feel that too. With all kinds of ideas that you learnt on your journey, that were not really accepted when you came back, because you are around people who don't have that sense of perspective.",

            "comment": "Great post and insight. I think solo traveling has made it more difficult for myself to create new friendships and maintain my current ones, due to how off-putting it has become to listen to my incredibly privileged American friends (I'm from Salt Lake City, Utah) complain all day and night about politics, how \"awful\" America is, and just listen to their political ideologies that to me, come off as quite aggressive and close minded. \n\nHowever, it's important to take into account when we travel, we are tourists. We will never know exactly what it's like to be a local in a country we travel to. More likely than not we don't know their language, have never gone through their education system, are ignorant of their culture/history, etc. I just mention this because I have noticed in myself and other solo travelers, that we have a tendency to act more \"awakened\" and knowledgable about the world than we truly are. Always good to try and remain humble and recognize our ignorance.\n\n\\*Just general thoughts. Again, great post. Just happened to be thinking about this exact topic when I came across it.",

Echoing that OP does not seem to truly recognize the privilege they have to travel and solo travel relative to most of the world, including Canada and the United States. A couple of points:\n\n1. The privilege of intellectual/emotional growth from travel is not something that many can do. Oftentimes, travel/'vacation' is in the context of a rest mindset and not a growth mindset. **You are not better/making a superior choice than someone else is for taking a growth mindset to travel.**\n2. You state you are not judging people for not travelling, but then you say this: \"*some of these people definitely \\_can \\_ travel I had to work and save money for it; they have plenty of money to do it. They just don\u2019t.*\" To repeat one more time, you are not morally superior in any way for spending money on travel, not even to a very wealthy person who has more than sufficient wealth to do so. **Just because you made a different choice with your money than they did, does not inherently make your choice better.**\n3. **A person does not need to travel to have sufficient confidence and intelligence to have an opinion on world issues.** You may have perceived a personal shift in your viewpoints post-travel, but that does not mean your peers started from where you did. **To discredit others opinions as ignorance, ESPECIALLY on issues that pertain to their local communities, of which do not apply to you** (i.e. your example of cultural appropriation within North America for NA-raised immigrants, which does not apply to you), **is such an incredible statement of hubris.**\n4. **Your post is a disorganized laundry list of your 'hot take' opinions on cultural appropriation, which you seem to try to justify with the reasoning that 'you have an open-minded perspective'.** *But they don't have the exposure or experience that makes their viewpoint worth considering, because the world at large is not on the same page with them.* **It is ironic that you have such an 'open minded perspective' but that, to you, people who don't travel don't have experiences that make their viewpoint worth considering.**\n5. **While you may disagree with the opinions of others with respect to cultural appropriation, this is not a forum for you to use your time or experience travelling to validate those viewpoints**; this is also not a forum for people to educate you on that, but clearly you have a lot of learning to do. Perhaps engaging more deeply with people in countries you visit can offer better insight, along with learnings that are readily available on the internet.",

You'll have a shallow but large insight of Europe, the states, and Canada, which most people can't say they have so well done you.

Or even remotely working in between fun travel and exploring. You don't don't that all the time when you live somewhere. You can barely get a feel for how a city functions in a month. Let alone a whole country.\n\nWe do learn by traveling and get some feel for culture and how people carry themselves and all that. That all happens. \n\nBut it's not like we know what is to be in that culture or city or community. That takes much longer.",

I never really noticed a correlation between travel and \"acceptance\" or \"open-mindedness.\"\n\nI honestly feel that I learned unexpected things travelling, but learned a lot more from reading articles online and interacting with international people on Twitter. When travelling, there's always a filter of who speaks a common language with you, who's interested in talking to travellers, and what they're willing to say to a stranger. People are more candid online and language barriers are weaker. People can easily travel to a country and just pass through; it can take good luck or existing baseline research to learn something you find meaningful.    \n\nAnd we're from Toronto! It's very, very easy to get perspectives from people from all over the world here...\n\nSo to me it's less about that people are \"untravelled\" and more that *certain* social media use rewards people for maintaining very limited, simplistic takes and also expects them to weigh in on every issue in the world. It's frustrating.",

In general, and far more often than not, individuals who chose to travel to new and different places than where they are most familiar or comfortable also tend to be the most open-minded, accepting, and enlightened individuals when compared to those who either do not travel or those who only travel to places or only seek out experiences which are most similar to that which they are most familiar or comfortable. The United States is one of the best examples of that. In the US, a recent study showed that 1 in10 have never left the state in which they were born, and over half, 54% have visited 10 or fewer states. 40% of Americans have never left the country and over half have never owned a passport. Sure there are people who have traveled the globe ad remain ignorant and close-minded and there are those who have never left their home city but have used the internet and books and tv/movies to open their minds and experience life and cultures beyond their own 4 walls. but both instances are exceptions to and not the rule.",

But I also had to work crazy hard for it. My family became poor and broken overnight, I didn't have a lot of the support system and financial well-being that other Indians had that you mention in your post, so I don't like being grouped like that. I spent my time visiting, working, and studying in over 25 countries, paying for 100% out of my own pocket. All to say that I disagree with you wholeheartedly. I have met many arrogant travelers. So many forms of them. The ones who rely on parent's incomes, the hippies, the ones who only hang out with their nationality in hostels, the drunk assholes only there to fuck people, the voluntourists, the ones who only want their Instagrams to be poppin and then turn into cunts when the camera is off, and everything they have in common is their egotistical elitism about being a place doing things other people can't afford.\n\nI feel this is what you're doing. I'm glad you were able to do something you wanted to do. And I can definitely acknowledge people talk out of their asses and don't go explore the world on their own - I wish it was mandatory somehow. But we don't travel in order to inform ourselves. We travel in order to experience. That's it. Because there is no right or wrong. There will always be depths of information we will never understand. For example, even if I lived in Hong Kong for 10 years because of work, do I know truly the context of living like a native-born there? No, never. I cannot know these things. But I can observe them. And use those observations to understand the many shades of gray in human behavior...including in our own. Because if we come back from traveling more embittered and angry, rather than growing compassion from our increased understanding of people and their different social norms, then perhaps we have traveled wrongly.\n\nEdit: I wanted to ask - \\*why\\* do you seek significance being a solo traveler? Honest question. Did you do it to \"prove\" something to people, or yourself? Otherwise, why would it matter?",

Viewpoints are oft justified after the fact by saying well 'everyone believe what I believe' with little to no evidence.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&gt;Expecting someone to care about what you care about is ridiculous. SoloTravel showed me that - people have been raised and go through differentlifes. And sometimes thee issues you're passionate about, are just notgoing to be reciprocated with other, and you learn to accept it and moveon.\n\nHaving people care about what you care about is just friendship.  It isn't some ridiculous foreign concept.  Any individual's first reference for what other people think and feel is themselves, so of course they often expect others to think and feel as they do.\n\nAs to whether someone is a piece of shit for disagreeing with you that is largely dependent on the issue.  If you for instance are a white supremacist well then you are a piece of shit and I will not just accept it and move on.  The lesson to draw from traveling is not to just accept any abhorrent believe and move on.",

You just meet the people who deal with tourists or who are travelling as well so thats not a representative sample. People complain the US, and Europe did this and that, but try living - not travelling as a foreigner, actually live as a local - in one of those places where you can't even use tap water to brush your teeth, where there's filth and polution and where often it is not safe to walk around (specially as a woman) and then come back and tell us where is the sad place.\n\nI am all about travelling and experiencing things. But I also know I can only do that because I live in a society that makes sure my other basic needs are met and so I am free to develop a sense of curiosity and to question things. There's a reason why lots of people from those countries want to come live here while we pay to visit for a couple of weeks. Sorry but this is the reality.",

When you travel and see how other people live, you can better appreciate how \"small\" some of the issues back home could be, how privileged we well-off travelling westerners are, etc. People who don't travel often don't appreciate this fully (but I acknowledge things can be very very difficult for people in nominally \"developed\" countries as well). The problem that I think OP was getting at (or at least that's what came to my mind) is that we tend to have less empathy and understanding of \"others\" we have never met, e.g. immigrants and refugees from war-torn countries, if they are far away and look different to us. This was very well exemplified by the response to refugees from Middle East &amp; Africa vs Ukrainians across the west.",

If we take everyone in then this no longer would be a good place to live, because it would create problems of shortage of jobs, which would lead to some of those living in ghettos and having too much free time and turning to crime (you see that in detention camps). It also has health concerns because more people means sanitation and trash issues and they might bring diseases to which we are not immune (that's why you always see people receiving them with gloves and mask for example). It will also bring the rise of conflicts and extremist movements that threaten our cohesion because it will get even worst for people from here who already lived badly.

The reason it is an issue in North America is because there are large populations from other countries whom are born and raised in North America, but are Asian Americans or African Americans, etc.\n\nThe reason this causes is an issue is because for those individuals when they see someone imitating their culture it's viewed as essentially stealing something they feel should only be for them due to their heritage. Watching someone with no birth level connection engaging in that activity can cause anger since its something that makes them unique.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to people who were born into the culture and have foreigners try to engage with it. They will not feel threatened by a foreigner partaking in their culture since they internally know it fully belongs to them and only are happy to see others try to integrate themselves.\n\nSince you were born &amp; grew up in India you will not feel this, but if you have children and live in Canada they will likely have these feelings if they saw someone fully white/black/etc.. engaging heavily in Indian traditions.\n\nEdit:\n\nTo add to this, for a long period of time when I was young I was in a relationship with a native born Chinese girl. I identified and adopted a lot of the culture during that relationship. When I asked her on a scale of 0 - 100 how Chinese I acted she gave a number of like 50%. However when I mentioned this to an American born Chinese person he went absolutely crazy criticizing me heavily. \n\nSomeone born &amp; raised in China knows someone can never be more Chinese than them since they are the definition of Chinese. Seeing someone adopt cultural values &amp; traditions is seen as open minded and respectful. For the American born Chinese person it was completely insulting that someone who was white could consider themselves even partly culturally Chinese (Even though it was a Chinese born person claiming this) since I had no idea what it was like to have Asian parents or look Asian.",

You're being invited by people from that culture to partake in a celebration.\n\nWearing a Native American warbonnet to Coachella is cultural appropriation. First of all, indigenous people in North America faced aggressive, brutal attempts at genocide. They faced death marches, having their ancestral lands stolen from them, their children forcibly removed, massacres, biological warfare, and on and on. All of which, descendants of those same colonizers (or people who look like them) are still reaping the benefits of. So, I can imagine that it's pretty painful when your community is still feeling the effects of hundreds of years of genocide, and then you see Karlie Kloss wearing a symbol of leadership and community on her head on a runway at a Victoria's Secret fashion show. \n\nIs a travel a good way to open your mind and educate yourself about the world? Of course. But just because someone doesn't have the privilege to be able to live out a backpack for weeks or months at a time and travel the world doesn't mean that they don't have anything to teach you. If you want to learn, you have to listen to people too. Nuance is everywhere.",

You get to see new things, new ways, new perspective...a refreshing change from your clockwork life. Meeting new people was exciting. \n\nNow it's all about opinions. Right and wrong.

There are a lot of generous, interesting, kind, different, and beautiful-in-their-own-way people you meet on the road. \n\nPerhaps it is fear, but eventually I gave that up for stability and having a predictable tomorrow. I suppose a more positive spin would be to say that while we shed as we pick up, there is a time for everything in life. For everything there is a season? \n\nI am probably rambling but I am glad you are having good experiences out there. I miss it for sure. \n\n&gt; As a traveler, as you meet more people, most of whom are open-minded, you slowly realize that we all have our struggles and we all want the same things.\n\nThis is so very true. I think that it is a reminder to the notion that worldliness/being well travelled can lead to a better planet. So many people are caught up in their own contexts and can't imagine that there could be any other culture/context/set of problems because they have only been surrounded by one culture their whole lives.",

In fact, I\u2019m such a solo person about all things in life that I find it difficult to assimilate to society as a whole. I began with solo biking. I had no choice but to begin biking as a form of transportation because our mother didn\u2019t drive\u2014she has some sort of internal GPS disability that made it impossible for her to even contemplate driving. We grew up without a dad\u2014we learned to drive on our own and/or via the school-mandated driver\u2019s education that was in place in \nCalifornia at that time (thanks, Pete Wilson, for removing that from California school\u2019s mandatory curriculum\u2026ass).\n\nThis took me to places I had never explored before in our very own farming town. It was magical and continues to be magical to just jump on a bike and/or car and explore the old and the new places in towns around the country\u2014from old mining towns in the Sierras of California to the sleek high rises of cities like Chicago and New York. I never want to stop road tripping. My kids have taken on the passion themselves and am fortunate that we did a lot of road tripping when they were at home. Yet, the magic comes alive more so when I am alone. I meet people from all walks of life and have been fortunate to call a lot of them \u201cpassing\u201d friends\u2014by choice. I stay in touch with some of them, of course\u2014but, it\u2019s not imperative that they remain in my life. What stays with me is the bonding memories I experienced when I first met them and the lessons I\u2019ve learned from them\u2014their family\u2019s history, the towns\u2019 history through their voices, and, above all, their generosity in seeing me as someone that wanted to learn about THEM\u2014what their souls were all about\u2014their personal interpretation of life\u2014from the mundane to the special events. I thirst for all of it. As a woman of color, some initial meetings were rough\u2014as pre-conceived ideas they had been taught were difficult to cross\u2014sometimes for both of us\u2014but cross we did on numerous occasions. It\u2019s been a crazy and wonderful trip so far. And, it\u2019s not over yet\u2026life through solo traveling is magical and full of colours that fill, and will continue to fill, my heart and soul until the day I die.",

The reason, in the US, Black Americans see that as cultural appropriation is because they had to fight for those styles to be acceptable.\n\nWhite people had the monopoly over what was considered professional. There was even a law passed in the 1800\u2019s that had Black women cover their hair. Even today, Black people in other parts of the world as well, have to fight for their hair to be shown on platforms. We are just now getting more news anchorwomen being able to do their jobs with their natural hair and protective hairstyles. And we still have to worry about if we\u2019re going to be hired or not due to our hair.\n\nSo when Black people see non-Black people with the hairstyles they condemned, **especially** when they\u2019re making money off it, it upsets us.\n\nSince you grew up in a place where you\u2019re part of the majority demographic, you may not understand it like us minorities do.",

Cultural appropriation is a great example. Almost all style is culturally appropriated, not sure how you get around it. So when people claim clothing, hair styles, etc as appropriation, it's really a fine line that just makes people roll their eyes. An example of cultural appropriation I like to use is yoga - white women took a South Asian practice and turned it into a trendy workout with overpriced clothes without retaining any of the spiritual meaning behind it, and I've even been to studios completely dismissing that part because they are afraid of offending Christians... like that's not yoga, just call it active stretching then. \n\nAnother example is SM giving feminism new meaning, not in a good way. Women basically hating and bashing on men, saying women are better and all men are awful, etc. made people afraid to call themselves feminists when feminism is about equality - not rising women ABOVE men, but treating both equally. \n\ntl;dr - social media is toxic.",

I don't bother with these types any more.",

But then I go on social media and it seems like many countries are approaching a similar crossroads. But then I have to question whether that is just what I am seeing through the North American algorithm I am getting on those platforms. I haven\u2019t travelled enough recently to say. It all becomes quite circular. Are we self centred for thinking it\u2019s an especially NA problem and we just overlook or miss the issues when abroad? Or is it something specific to North America?",

There was an extended period of time where wearing their cultural attire (because it is their culture) flagged them as a target to be harassed, marginalized, murdered, framed as \"savages\", and the like... Fast forward to now: white people who hold the majority of power in society (due to colonial history) can wear whatever they want and suffer no consequences. What's more, they can sell the attire that they copied from a culture that was previously harmed for wearing it. Native Americans could not profit off of their cultural artefacts, and now are systemically marginalized and disadvantaged (hard to accumulate wealth in the capitalist system when you are starting from scratch). So the insensitivity comes from being someone who doesn't care that they are having fun wearing \"a silly hat\" when the history of wearing that item for the group it originally represented resulted in dire consequences for that group.",

You meet so many people (some places you don\u2019t and don\u2019t even talk to anyone mind you) and go to so many amazing places, at home I go to work, go to the gym, go home, might meet up with some of the friends I have left if they are free and then go to bed. Repeat. The walk to works the same, works the same most days and the people I talk to are the same. I was very lucky to meet all those people on their travels but it does sometimes suck that I don\u2019t get to meet that many people back at home.

For some time now, i been longing to go back to a proper house, a proper job and a regular routine.

Stay away of those people and dive into activities related with traveling, soon you will meet locals who have experienced the same as you.\n\nAnd just to be a little fair, we all where inside one of those bubbles before our first trip.

You\u2019re just full of dopamine and in happy mode because you\u2019re taking a pause from the real world to be in the travel world. You will seldom find other travellers who are as negative as people back home because people who are able to or are travelling, tend to have enough going on in their life they needn\u2019t be upset. \n\nThe one big thing you also need to realize is that especially in Canada, the average person is struggling. Our country is far too expensive that people cannot afford to travel or be up to date on world cultures. Most of the world is in these bubbles you despise. The next time you travel, you should actually visit the local peoples of the cities you visit. Hostels, hostel people and touristy spots are a bubble that is also ignorant of the real world realities. You will see that politics have be very polarized in much of the world. However, in some places it\u2019s illegal to discuss politics, which could also be a reason why you don\u2019t encounter that polarization. \n\nDo I think I\u2019ve learned things from travelling? Of course. Does it actually make me more open minded or aware of the world? I can\u2019t say because my experience in the dozens of places I\u2019ve travelled to with the exception of Ukraine was the traveller version of those places. \n\nYou miss being away and meeting others doing something similar.

I think traveling to a totally new place and working with different people I didn't know has helped me to become more humble and critical about my point of view and my perception of the world. What I found great was that I lived together with other volunteers and locals what made it possible to get to know them throughout the time and build meaningful relationships. The work I was doing (cleaning, doing dishes, scrubbing the floor, doing\"dirty\" work) was hard for me at the beginning because I felt like I was forced to do it but this changed. I noticed how unimportant my personal priorities were, work just had to be done, this was a big lesson for me, because it humbled me. Now as I am back to life at home for a couple of years I started to notice that it's not easy for me to maintain all the lessons I learned and I sometimes stumble back into old ways of thinking. It really is frustrating when I realize this but it's also an opportunity to keep improving or at least remind myself of what I already learned and experienced. Always being in a small bubble is (at least in my opinion) damaging and prevents me to be open minded and curious.\n\nI think it's also possible to experience new things in your home town, you just have to look out for new possibilities constantly.",

But she has basically disowned me and other people in our friend group because we don\u2019t think exactly like her. Like she uses the fact that she\u2019s experienced so many other cultures and places as an excuse to be the same judgmental person she\u2019s always been without having to feel bad about it.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m in the GenX age range and I love to travel. I caught the travel bug young and did my first international trip to study Spanish in Costa Rica when I was 17, back in the mid 90s. I spent a lot of 20s traveling and living around the world (study abroads, J-1 visas and a masters in Europe) way before cell phones. I was great cause I worked as a bartender in Miami during college, made great money, and back in the late 90s/early 2000 summers in Miami were very slow in the service business so I could take the summer off work, travel the world, leave more shifts for the full time people and come back to my job. While I was gone, I carried maps and my travel book and met some amazing people from all over the world. I\u2019d stay in hostels, meet people, maybe travel some more with them, maybe meet up with people I met on previous travels. It was really amazing. \n\nRecently my husband and I were in Albania and some other Balkan countries and there were several times we were out at a restaurant and there would be several young solo travelers, each sitting at their own table and all of them just stuck, face in their phones the whole time and it made me sad. I miss the days where you would see someone and think, \u201chey, I\u2019m solo, you\u2019re solo we should hangout\u201d. Talking to random singles, couples or groups and hanging out are some of my best memories and it made me miss the days where things like that happened. Maybe I was projecting things on to them, but even though I did a lot of solo traveling, I was hardly ever actually solo and I think because there weren\u2019t any cell phones back then to entertain you when you were solo.",

We ended up a group of 5 independent groups), if I just want to enjoy my food, I'll go by myself.\n\nNot everyone is super social all the time, sometimes you just need alone time to recharge.",

Not all of us solo travellers want to always hang out with other people. Not to mention it\u2019s much easier to research and book travel now with the internet and phones at our fingertips. \n\nAnd as a solo female traveller I feel (and likely am) a lot safer now that I can so easily stay in contact with my friends and family and share my whereabouts and itinerary. I see nothing but good things about this development.",

It's hard to say A is x1000 better than B if you didn't experience B.

They could have been reading a book (as I often do on my phone while travelling because it saves space and is one less charger to pack). Those people could have been tired and enjoying the quiet alone time; I\u2019m highly social when I travel but as an introvert I also usually spend a few days at a time alone when I\u2019m travelling, on purpose, to recharge. That alone time often involves me zoning out on my phone, either messaging friends back home, researching the place I currently am, looking up my next destination, paying bills or getting my money and emails sorted (not everyone sells all their belongings to travel indefinitely, we still have responsibilities we need to account for).\n\nHow do you even know that all the people you saw were solo travellers? They could have been expats or locals. Not every stranger has to talk to every other stranger if they happen to be alone. Plenty of people enjoy their own company.\n\nYou\u2019re definitely projecting. The \u201cphones are ruining socialising and travel\u201d rant is so unoriginal and overdone. Not everyone is addicted to their phone just because they use it as the useful resource that it is. You can\u2019t tell an entire person\u2019s travel experience by observing a few people at one meal time in their entire day/week/life.",

When I personally have my face glued to my phone, sometimes I'm just scrolling, but sometimes I'm chatting with friends back home, sometimes I'm reading the news, and sometimes I'm reading an e-book. Tbh, passing judgment on others for just using their phones at all if they're using it in a way that isn't disruptive to you sounds a bit boomer-y.\n\nEdit: I was also pretty late to get a smart phone, so I traveled solo several times before then. I absolutely do not miss getting lost, having no way to communicate with anyone (like a restaurant, transport, my accommodations) Unless I managed to find someone with wifi that didn't have a password. And I hated if I didn't bring anything to do in a restaurant, sitting there reading every word on the menu or memorizing the wall decorations to pass the time until my food came.",

Cell phones definitely make traveling and planning much easier, for sure, but just because you have one doesn't mean you have to constantly be looking at it. I also think that in terms of meeting people, it's not just about the phone. I find that the other travelers that I meet and engage with while traveling solo are usually 40 plus. Not by choice, it just seems to happen that way.  Many younger travelers would rather hang out with their peers than someone their parent's age, which totally makes sense.

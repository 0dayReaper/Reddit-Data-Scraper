    "postText": "I ate something bad the night before last, and was vomiting and pissing shit for about 5 hours. I went and bought some tablets and electrolyte salts and was feeling much better.\n\nStupidly, I tried eating last night as I hadn't eaten anything all day, and now I've woken up with diarrhoea in my boxers, duvet and mattress lining. It's also stained the mattress itself.\n\nI've removed the mattress lining and duvet and covered the mattress stains up with it. My plan right now is to wait until 7.30AM when the bar opens (currently 6.45AM right now) and let the staff know I need a change of sheets. \n\nIt hasn't stunk out the dorm, and there's only 3 other people here, with 4 empty dorm beds. Hopefully the smell doesn't spread though. I tuned off the fan near my bed too. \n\nDo you guys have any further suggestions? Have any of you experienced something similar?\n\nI'll definitely look back on this and laugh, but right now this is a really shitty situation to be in :( \n\nEdit: I let one of the hostel workers know that I needed a change of sheets. He said they can do that. I didn't mention the shit though, nor did they press for details as to why I needed fresh sheets. Fingers crossed it stays that nonchalant.\n\nEdit: The guy said with a smile that the sheets have been changed, no problem. I had my doubts since we're dealing with liquid shit staining the mattress, but lo and behold, I check my bed and it's completely fine. I have no idea how it was fixed that quickly. All seems to be well. Thank you guys for joining me on this journey.\n\nEdit: Oh my god!! My first ever gold!!! Thank you so much kind redditor, I always wondered what my first gold would be like and what I would get it for - shitting myself in a foreign country away from anyone who knows me and loves me fits perfectly. Thank you!!",

Because it seems early where you are (its 5pm here lol), then I'd give it a go at cleaning. Get some gloves and use cold water first. It's on you to do this if you decide to do it. Make sure you have the proper cleaning agents if you decide to try and clean. \n\nPersonally, I'd wad the whole thing up and throw it out, and call it a loss. Inform the hostel when it opened that I had a medical problem and that you'd like to pay them for the damages. Any reasonable person is going to understand; shit happens. \n\nAlso, don't sleep on it without cleaning the mattress. That's just asking for problems.",

Rolled the sheet up with the stain in the middle of the wad and left an explanatory note with its own tip on top of the bundle. Didn't get an angry call from the hotel later so I take that to mean it was okay! If only I'd posted about it on Reddit ;)",

Did not find this out until that moment. Additionally earlier on that evening there was shit on the sheets anyway. Point being in most hostels they have standards and those standards are shit, often literally. I never rent a hostel bed expecting it to be vomitless, shitless and weird etc...",

The problem is you couldn\u2019t keep your ass shut, so you shat, left some shit.  What to do?  Go downstairs to the desk clerk, after appropriately cleaning your self up and fess up by advising that that you shot.  (Still a verb but trying to emphasize the past tense). By the way, where are you from?  Let me guess\u2026Shetland?   Mission accomplished!  I used all the vowels!  I am not sure any of this helps you with your problem.  I will leave that o the other Redditors.",

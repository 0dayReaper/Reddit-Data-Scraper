    "postText": "Hello all, was wondering if any other solo travellers have transited through Brunei airport before? \n\nI\u2019m flying home from Hong Kong to London on the 25th May with a layover in Brunei. The flight from HK departs at 14:55 and arrives 17:55 local time. The original flight from Brunei to London was scheduled to leave at 19:15 which would have given me an hour and 20 minutes in between but I\u2019ve received an email from Royal Brunei informing me that the Brunei to London flight will now depart 30 minutes earlier, at 18:45, only leaving me 50 minutes between flights. \n\nBoth flights are through Royal Brunei airlines so I\u2019m assuming my checked baggage will go all the way to London otherwise I don\u2019t know how 50 minutes will be enough time.\n\nI am a UK citizen which means I have 90 day visa free entry into Brunei so hopefully shouldn\u2019t have any visa holdups, plus it\u2019s the same airline so I\u2019m hoping I am covered if there\u2019s a long queue and I end up missing the 2nd flight but would be good to hear from anyone who\u2019s done a similar journey. \n\nTL;DR: Is a 50 minute layover in Brunei long enough considering both flights are on the same airline? Thank you to anyone who can help!",

You won't have to clear customs.\n\n\nYou will have no problem making it from one gate to another in 50 mins.\n\n\nCheck luggage on short connections is always a concern.  How hard working are the guys unloading your inbound flight? Your bags might be a day late.",

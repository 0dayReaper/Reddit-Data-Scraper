    "postText": "After some opinions on my itinery please! I'm mid 20s F travelling solo, heading to Sri Lanka in June. I love wildlife, diving and the occasional party. I like to travel slow and not rush things, will probably be relying on public transport.  \n\n1 night at the airport (landing late) \n3 nights Sigiriya\n4 nights Trincomalee\n1 night Kandy \n1 night Nuwara Eliya\n4 nights Ella \n4 nights Arugam Bay \n3 nights Mirissa \n1 night Galle \n2 nights Negombo \n\nI can't decide between Minneriya NP or Yala. Would love to see the huge herds of elephants but a leopard is on the bucket list too. I'm thinking about staying in a guesthouse in Sigiriya so probably won't meet people to share with - are the national parks difficult/expensive to do solo? If I do Yala instead of Minneriya, I'd only spend 2 nights in Sigiriya and spend a night near Yala instead. \n\nAny advice appreciated please!",

            "comment": "I visited Sri Lanka in 2019, traveled around using local buses, and arranged a private safari in Udawalawe National Park - roughly between Galle (the Galle Fort is a sublime piece of heritage, highly recommended) and Ella - through the guesthouse where I was staying. Many, if not most of the accommodations are pretty well-connnected and have a network for arranging trip and other activities - especially those near major sights.  \n  \nThe safari was a glorious experience, saw tons of elephants and other wildlife (unfortunately no leopards) like crocs, jackals, various grazers, monkeys, loads of birds. So I wouldn't hesitate a second to arrange a game drive just for yourself if it features high on your bucket list!",

Not sure if that is a lot or not, but generally speaking prices were quite low because tourism was still recovering from the Easter suicide attacks.  \n\nIt wasn't the cheapest activity I've ever done (far from it), but it's well worth the price. Even without the leopards (which I finally managed to see in the wild last year, when I traveled to Rwanda and did a 3 day/2 night safari in the Akagera National Park).",

            "comment": "I visited just as covid hit - barely made it home before flights stopped running, so things may have changed. \n\nWhat\u2019s your general budget?  \n\nYala is amazing and worth staying in the grounds - there are a few places inside the park who include day safaris.  Worth the splurge for the experiences.  They will usually stop at the park office and get a park ranger to bring with them on the tour - they have more experience with the animals\u2019 movements and behaviours and can also pull rank over the other non-ranger drivers when it gets busy and everyone\u2019s racing around to spot something.  They have the authority to direct traffic or tell vehicles where to go which is a nice perk for you and your group. \n\nSaw a few elephants and a leopard!  A pangolin too - which was wild since they were suspected (at the time) of being a potential source of covid. \n\nClimbing Sigiriya is a must, but I\u2019m not sure what else is around to keep you in that area. Others will have better suggestions, I think. \n\nYour itinerary sounds good.  Kandy was fine - so one night is good when you\u2019re seeing Ella and Nuwara Eliya. \n\nConsider the train between NE and Kandy.  Inexpensive and scenic - and a great way to mix with locals (a group brought a karaoke machine on our train and the trip was a big dance and singing party with kids included - everyone was having fun.  You never know who you can meet.   And it always felt safe - a big plus. \n\nI visited an organic hobby farm (tour of plants and crops and trees) followed by lunch that came from the property - delish.  There are all kinds of small places and individuals that offer unique and inexpensive experiences throughout the country.  \n\nAyurvedic day spa - $40/day for them to pour oil on your forehead (so relaxing) and rub you down, head-to-toe (professional, nothing creepy). \n\nThe smaller roads - especially in higher country (inland) are brutal - so make sure you rely on a reputable vehicle or train to get around. \n\nTea country is breathtaking, so while the tours are somewhat boring it\u2019s helpful to understand the history of the country and relationship to India and Britain, amongst others.  You get to see how tea leaves are picked and how labour-intensive it is for the workers. \n\nI would say - don\u2019t be a hero and go too far off the beaten path. The unrest there is still an undercurrent and there\u2019s no need to push your boundaries and get into areas and situations that are not needed.  Enjoy your time - the Sri Lankans are some of the friendliest people there are - and they are usually happy to help and show tourists a good time that will keep them coming back. \n\nI hope to do so within a few years as well.  Please post when you return so we see how your trip was!",

Anyway, since you're traveling solo, it should be fairly easier to find a group safari that will take you (just coordinate with wherever it is you're staying, they'll probably have contacts).  \n\nIf you're doing Ella, you can probably skip Nuwara. It's not very different, and Ella is a bit more nature-y.\n\nBy the way, I assume jet lag isn't a big issue for you?

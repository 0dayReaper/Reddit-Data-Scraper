    "postText": "Here I am on a three week trip to a place I\u2019ve never been before and it started pretty good. About two weeks in though I lost my luggage including my passport (very unlikely I\u2019ll get them back) and now my mood has dropped so much. The consulate hasn\u2019t been very helpful and I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t be able to get an emergency passport in time to go home. I also have work stress waiting back home (if I get back late I could miss a huge career opportunity as well as the chance to live much closer to my family, as it is I live somewhere I don\u2019t even like). I\u2019m homesick and worried. I\u2019m a grown man, stressed out and have been on the verge or tears this morning wanting to just go home. \n\nCan anyone relate or offer encouragement?",

But I keep reminding myself that this feeling, it too shall pass away, like the happy feelings. \nThere\u2019s no cure to this feeling in the moment, but try to talk to yourself that the feeling is temporary. You are not alone brother. Stay strong.",

Go ahead and cry about it and everything else stressing you out. Then, take steps to control what you can. You've talked with the consulate about a new passport. That's up in the air. Can you let work know what is going on? Do you have money and a change of clothes? Take care of the important stuff you can control. Then, if possible, try to enjoy what you can from the trip. Hope it all works out for you.",

You got this, one step at a time. \n\nFor the career opportunity you mention. Reach out and be honest if you need too. At this point there is only so much control. Also remember we don't live to work. \n\nIm 41yrs old and still dealing with loneliness &amp; depression daily. Life isnt meant to be easy. That would be boring as hell! Hope this helps",

I lost my passport whilst travelling many years ago but I had my best friend with me and I really didn't stress over it much, just got an emergency passport from the embassy and cut my trip short. If I had been alone I think I'd lose my shit. Reach out to people you trust as much as you can, things will get better soon.",

            "comment": "Almost. For me, it was some form of bad luck.\n\nIt was in March 2018 and I was in Bratislava for a day trip. I kept to myself all the time and just went about my stroll like any normal person would, local or otherwise. I was sampling some *trdelnik* at a streetside food stall when this old man &gt;!suddenly came over, grabbed my hand and \"asked\" me to \"have fun\" with him, with a (ghastly) whisper.!&lt; I was beyond shocked, but I managed to repeatedly say \"NO\" firmly and pried his hands away. Once I broke free, I quickly brisk walked all the way back to the old town area (thank god I scouted out the area before I got there so I have some ideas about my bearings). I hid myself in a busy indoor market area and tried to hide in the crowd, but that just made my anxiety even worse, so I left quickly. Eventually I found myself back in the tourist information centre.\n\nThe sinking dread only set in after the adrenaline rush was over, and it was like spiralling down an overthinking vortex. Numerous scenarios of me ending up in a worse state flashed in my mind. Needless to say, I was paralysed mentally and had to sit down. I, for the first time, was thinking about cutting this trip short by hopping on an earlier train back because I was genuinely scared at that time. And I thought about my future plans of travelling solo to other countries (I was considering Romania, Bulgaria etc. at that time) and inevitably projected the possibility of &gt;!me getting abducted, sexually harrassed, or even wounding up dead onto them.!&lt;Crazy and hasty, I know. But I was conjuring all sorts of worst case scenarios and fear gripped onto me like no tomorrow. I even doubted my own \"efforts\" to blend in; wearing neutral colours like the locals do, wearing sunglasses, keeping silent etc. Was that all wrong?\n\nIn the end, I managed to calm down enough and started thinking with more rationality. These things are bound to happen at some point, as much as I hate to admit it and as unfortunate as it is. I was lucky enough to escape, and that should serve as a learning point for me; at least I know what I should do if I ever get into situations like this. And frankly, I realised that I refused to let one bad person to ruin my day, my confidence and my plans. After an hour or two, I was finally calm enough to set out wandering in the old town area. Though still wary and on alert more, I was able to conclude the day trip as planned without any further hiccups. Fun side note, there was a street musician playing a handpan in the town square which greatly lifted my mood (thanks to whoever it was! It was nice listening to it).\n\nLooking back at this experience, I want to stress that basic safety awareness is of utmost importance, as with trying to keep a cool head. Back then, simple things like snapping out, stepping away and cooling down for a bit helped me to finally calm down. I think everyone should not indulge themselves in the false optimism that \"such a thing will never happen to me\". Being realistic about the actual risks and the appropriate actions should it ever happen is the way to go for me.",

Lots of crying and feeling sorry for myself, but I just keep pushing through and taking it day by day and have had some incredible experiences and met some wonderful people.

But I'm also in a mentally healthy place. Traveling has increased that for me as well, since I see how big the world truly is, how impermanent things/life is, and how that gives meaning to the minut things in life. It shows you that there are better things out there to value; and when something goes wrong there no more emotional attachment to it, it's just life, easier to accept, and move forward.\n\nBut as one man to another. Cry brother. That shit feels good, its healthy, and it clears things up mentally. It's the first step of picking yourself back up, and although it's an emotional process, it's one of the most logical things you can do.",

    "postText": "I will be flying from London Heathrow to Haneda Japan in September and have found two flights with Cathaway in the \u00a3900-1k range that I am seriously considering, but one has 50 minute layover and other a 1 hour 30 minutes one. I have never travelled on Cathway before or to this side of the world, so I am not entirely sure what to expect. \n\nWould 50 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes be enough time to transfer at an Airport like Hong Kong?",

If you are, and assuming you mean Cathay Pacific, then they presumably know what they are doing as it's their hub. And if you miss the 2nd flight due to them delaying, they should have plenty of other flights to Tokyo to put you on.",

I was rushed through the airport (literally at running speed) by an airport worker who took me to the front of every line. I just made the connection, but my bag did not.\n\nIn general, 2 hours is the minimum safe connection time for major airports like HK.",

Sure, they can prolly put you on the next available flight but it\u2019s just not a fun thing to deal with.",

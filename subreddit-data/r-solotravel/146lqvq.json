    "postText": "What travel magazines and websites do you like to browse?\n\nI like: \n\n* Wikitravel, especially the 'Understand' section. I understand it's far from accurate, but it's fun reading other people's opinions and readings of places.\n* Lonely Planet. I know it has detractors, but I really appreciate how they make an effort to use local authors and cover a wide variety of experiences. It's definitely not the banana pancake publication it used to be once. \n* Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller (UK over US; also the India edition because that's where I live) mostly to know what's new, even if I can hardly ever afford it. I think of it like a pin-up magazine, just that it's about pretty hotels instead of women. \n* NatGeo Traveller (UK and India) because they do make an effort to explore intrepidly. But that's why they also feel a bit too niche at times. \n\nI also love flipping through inflight magazines but haven't come across any genuinely nice ones of late - almost all seem to push out glossy guides for their destinations and little else. It's been a long time since I've flown Lufthansa, but I did like what they'd done there though. \n\nElsewhere on social media, I usually hate Instagram travel influencers, but do like a few who post niche content about heritage or solo travel (travelsofsamwise, lostwithoutpurpose, sarahmonim etc). Its nice to have some backstory to the images I see instead of the same recycled glamour model posing interchangably at instagram hotspots. \n\nI also read a lot and like to pick up books based in or written by citizens of the places I'm travelling to, but that's a different discussion. \n\nWhat do you folks like? Would be great if I can discover new options. :)",

It lists quirky and off-the-beaten-path destinations in each city - like strange buildings, statues, historical sites or unusual restaurants. \n\nI've planned many self-guided walking tours around the stuff I find on Atlas Obscura!",

I made a point to try to find them, and it ended up being a fun day exploring the city and discovering new things that I might have otherwise missed.",

I like its \"Travel Deeper\" mantra; the stories feel more personal.\n\nInstagram influencers annoy the living shit out of me. Same with 90-95% of YouTube travel channels.",

    "postText": "Hi guys\u2014 new to this page. I\u2019m a 25 yo white male living in Chicago. I\u2019ve taken a couple solo trips, biggest being to Europe. I\u2019m planning a trip to Asia and my original plan was Tokyo/Seoul/Shanghai because of proximity. \n\nHowever after talking to family members and friends who have visited, they convinced me to do a Hong Kong/Bangkok/Singapore trip instead, which I\u2019m totally on board with. \n\nI\u2019m looking to explore and relax. Huge on food &amp; nightlife. Also love sports and beer. Trip is mostly for exploration as I\u2019m getting that travel itch. Will have about 17-18 days to explore. How much time do I need in each city to get the essence and not feel too rushed? I was thinking of adding a large Vietnam city or Bali for a couple days but would love to hear other cities. Budget isn\u2019t an issue and don\u2019t mind longer flights. \n\nThank you!!!",

            "comment": "Won't comment on Hong Kong as I haven't been there, but if I were to go, I'd give it 4 days at least. 2-3 to see the core city, and another day or two to explore the beaches and trails of it's nature reserves.\n\nBangkok will need at least three clear days for checking out the highlights (only) at a comfortable pace. You could squeeze it down to two, but its a hot and humid city where the midday weather can get to you. Also, since you're keen on nightlife, Bangkok is very fertile ground for hangovers. That said, the nightlife here is very vibrant (do make sure to sort the seedy from the genuinely good), and the food is stellar - I'd do a whole trip just to eat through the place. An extra day or two will allow you to figure day trips as well - Ayutthaya is great if you like history and heritage. \n\nHowever, if you are travelling to Bangkok, then not visiting a Thai island would be a missed opportunity. Look at Phuket if you like good resorts, Krabi if you want dramatic landscapes, Koh Samui if you want great beaches, and Koh Phangan for the (in)famous beach parties. There's atleast two dozen more options though, so a lot depends on your interests. I'd add the remainder of my trip here, and its relatively easy to fly direct from most to Singapore. Another option is Chiang Mai in northern Thailand, which gives you access to a great countryside apart from a very nice city with loads of temples and activities. \n\nSingapore can also be covered reasonably well in three days, but another day will help you dig a little deeper. Add an extra day if you'd like to see the theme parks of Sentosa as well. The city is very sanitized so don't expect the wilds of Bangkok here, but there are some great places to eat and drink. \n\nSingapore is also a good base for visiting the nearby Indonesian resort island of Bintan, but Indo has FAR better islands to visit, and it should ideally be an entire trip by itself. \n\nI wouldn't try to squeeze Vietnam into this for the same reason - you need to give the place time, and its best done on a dedicated trip. \n\nOther spots you could consider are Luang Prabang in Laos and Siem Reap in Cambodia. Both are arguably culture-heavy, but have a wide variety of attractions in their hinterland. Do give them a look too.",

I check if Anthony Bourdain ever did a show there and check travel blogger videos. I\u2019ll probably never hit any of the posh restaurants, but Bourdain also goes for street food and hole-in-the-wall gems too. Ask a local, in Porto, I just knew I wanted to try a Francesinha and sample as many pasteis de nata as possible without causing a sugar coma. I asked the owner of my hostel for a good Francesinha place and he ended up taking me out for a blueberry flavoured beer, to his favourite Francesinha place, for wine at his buddy\u2019s Indian restaurant, then charcuterie at his favourite dive bar. In the morning, he left 2 of his favourite pasteis de nata in the fridge with my name on the box.\n\nI also tend to avoid big meals because I never know what I may see that I want to try.",

I mean, nothing wrong with that, but I find it weird how this advice gets fetishised as some secret hack to finding \"real\" \"local\" places, usually by visitors who describe themselves as \"travellers not tourists\".  I'm going to trust someone who works in the food biz, or is a food reviewer, or makes a living in hospitality, etc etc etc rather than a random hotel clerk or taxi driver, unless I'm literally looking for a quick &lt;$5 lunch or a sandwich or something.",

So, I will generally look through all of their listings for a location, and filter down - I might be looking to do one or two $$+ meals requiring reservations, but I am also looking for hawker market/street food/mid-market ideas. Conversely, in Italy, this doesn't seem to happen - the guide for Taipei definitely has some listed dessert stands, but there is no listed gelato place in Rome, for whatever reason. So, I think the backpacker crowd SHOULD be open to the idea of using the Michelin app in certain parts of the world, but it might be a dud in Europe  \n\nGoogle Maps is not the uniform worldwide tool of choice - some countries like South Korea have a native winner instead (Naver). So, using Google in those countries is not going to get you a locals-weighted perspective, but rather some international crowd's. I will use it, but I will try to keep where I am in mind  \n\nThe NY Times tends to take food fairly seriously - search for \"36 hours in Tbilisi | Taipei...\" , and they might have a piece on a city you are headed to.  \n\nYou may also want to line up a food tour for the first day or two in a place - I got some Hanoi recommendations from Mark Lowerson having done a great night tour with him, and this made my life easier when I found myself desperately needing breakfast one day.",

Find a little watering hole that's not so busy that you can chat with the bartender without being intrusive, have a drink or two, be polite/friendly, leave a good tip, then ask for recs. Being polite and tipping well is key... when I bartended the rude cheapskates got recommended the bland pasta place or the overcooked burger place.",

How I find these is by doing a lot of random walking and trying to put the potential places that I see while walking in my memory or mark it on a map so I can visit them later. This only works if I spend more than a couple days at a place and admittedly is a hit or miss sometimes. Mostly it is a hit though.",

If not then just leave, the next good place can be just around the corner and you can always go back:)\n\nFoursqure is also a good app. I can just recommend it even if I forget about that sometimes (most of the times).",

Not to mention you run the risk of being recommended their bestie's restaurant for no reason. I read up on good sources like Bourdain that has been mentioned and I really like an app called Spotted by Locals. \n\nGoogle reviews can be used as a first filter to red-flag really bad places. If it has below 4 on Google then it must be a hellhole. Any \"ok\" place will have 4.5+ rating, equal to the really cool and worth it places. An exception to this rule is if you're specifically recommended a place that is supposed to be difficult. Like a BDSM club, a famously rude cafe manager, a place serving live seafood and other curiosities. In that case you will have disastrous reviews by normies who just weren't into that stuff, but you might still be looking for it.\n\nEdit: also, screw lines. I'm too old to wait in line. They sell ceviche, not the cure for cancer. I will either discover the cool spot that is not crowded, or I'll just keep walking until a celebrity spot happens to have an empty table. Food trucks of course have a line but I still avoid very long ones.",

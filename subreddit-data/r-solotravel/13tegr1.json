That way you could have flown in to Prague, take the train to everything in between, and fly out of London back to the states when finished. Would save a lot of hassle/be more comfortable and probably be cheaper.",

            "comment": "Londoner here - the underground can be quite daunting but people are usually happy to point you in the right direction. Apple/Google maps won't steer you wrong.\n\nIf you're in Notting Hill, your closest tube lines will be the Central, Circle and District lines. The lines are all colour coded, Central is red, District is green, Circle is yellow, and you can usually see on the maps where you can connect with different lines. So say I am on the Northern line and want to get on the central, I'd look up at the map on the train and see if I can spot red, but also there will be other lines you can get to the same place, so take Tottenham Court Road for example, you can get the Central, Elizabeth or Northern line to it.\n\nThe Central line runs all night on the weekends so that would be good for you to get back to Notting Hill if you're out late. If you have an iPhone (or Android) and you have a bank card on your phones wallet, you can use your phone to tap in and tap out, or you can just tap your physical card in and out if it's contactless. Otherwise, buy an Oyster card.\n\nStand to the right if you're not walking down the escalators, or walk down on the left side!\n\nParks - Regents Park, St. James' Park (near Buckingham Palace), Victoria Park are all really nice. Brockwell park is nice too.\n\nNightlife - it depends on what you want from it - Soho has loads of gay bars / clubs and pubs which would be good to do a crawl in because they're all quite conveniently located. Heaven / G.A.Y are the main clubs.\n\nThe big music venues which stay open until 4-6AM are Fabric, Fire &amp; Lightbox, Egg, Brixton Jam, Ministry of Sound, Hootananny usually has something going on but doesn't stay open that late. Check them out and see if there's anything that takes your fancy, the music scene in London is insanely good!! There's usually something going on somewhere.\n\nHope you have a great time! If it's hot out, London turns into a big old party and everyone just goes for it on the weekends!",

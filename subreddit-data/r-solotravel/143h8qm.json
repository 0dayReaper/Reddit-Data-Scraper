    "postText": "**Solo Travel Report - The Orkneys**\n\nI've not done one of these before so be gentle if I've missed anything out - just trying to give back to a community that has helped me in the past.\nThe Orkneys are a collection of Islands a few miles off the North of Scotland.\n\n**Travel** \nReaching the Orkneys is a choice of ferries several times a day from the Scottish Mainland (Northlink charge \u00a3130 car + 1 adult each way. Pentland Ferries are cheaper, but currently closed down), or you can take a small aircraft flight. Travel on the islands is probably best done by car, although there are buses to most of the popular sites. There are also a number of private tour companies who may collect. There are people visiting with smaller motorhomes and they seem able to get around fine - the roads generally are wide and straight and away from the hotspots, traffic is light. As with all of Scotland, wild camping is legal and there are people roadside parking overnight with campers, but check into this yourself if you want to do it. There are ferries to many of the other islands from the Orkney mainland so hopping between them is doable.\n\n\n**Accomodation**\nPlenty of B&amp;B/ guesthouse options. A little more expensive than the mainland, but reasonable. I'm staying for four days and nights, combining it with driving the NC500. I drove up from the bottom of the UK myself over two days and have scheduled four days to get back.\n\n\n**Climate** \nA few degrees colder than most of the UK at the moment, but still t-shirt weather at around 19c. You'd need to bring various layers and waterproofs in case the weather does change.\n\n\n**Scenery**\nThe views are amazing almost everywhere. Mixtures of low hills, lochs and the sea, with islands and mountains in the distance.\n\n\n**What to do:** \nNature and history are the main themes. Lots of ancient history, neolithic onwards, including a large amount of Viking and Norse history.  The Islands were used by the Royal Navy fleet during WW1 and WW2, and there are several impressive batteries and remains along the coast. Many standing stones, rings, Brochs and cairns. I chatted to some Birders on the ferry over who were raving about the seabird population, and indeed there seem to be a lot.\n\n**Don't miss:** \nSkara Brae (An ancient settlement).  Walks on the coast almost anywhere are full of amazing scenery. Hoxa Head worth a trip if you're into Wartime history. Broch of Gurness (Impressive fortified settlement)\n\n\nMany of the major attractions  cost money to visit and require booking in advance as they wish to spread visitor numbers. (Although I went to Skara Brae and only had to wait five minutes). Example costs; Skara Brae, \u00a312, Broch of Gurness, \u00a37.50. Italian Chapel: \u00a33.50. Not huge amounts and the money is reinvested by Historical Scotland, so it's hard to be grumpy about this.\n\n\nThere are two large cruise liners anchored off Kirkwall at the moment, and this has made most of the tourist sites much busier. But there are still plenty of places you can get away from the large groups of people. I've found several coves and beaches where I could chill out by myself. I've spent today walking parts of South Ronaldsay (one of the islands) and met very few other tourists. Mostly the odd local who are universally cheerful and pleasant.\n\n\n**Safety**\nIt's very suitable for solo travellers, especially if you are concerned about safety. It is a very safe place for anyone, in fact, it's the safest place in Scotland. \"A new study using Scottish Government crime statistics has found that Orkney is the safest area to live. The county has the lowest rate of crimes over the past year compared to the rest of Scotland, recording 143.8 per 10,000 people. It has reported 322 crimes in total between 2020/21.\"\n\n\nRecommended.",

            "comment": "OK, so you can call them \"the Orkney islands\" or \"Orkney\" but not \"the orkneys\" please. Just no. People will correct you to your face if you do that, they find it pretty annoying/offensive.\n\nAlso, you can fly into Kirkwall (but its expensive), and there are multiple ferries you can get, all at different costs, including one passenger ferry if you don't want a car.\n\nI'd recommend visiting other islands too, not just mainland, there's loads to do on the smaller islands, beautiful scenery and beaches, castles, museums, other archaeological sites similar to Skara Brae, wildlife reserves, lots to do! All either a short ferry ride or flight away, including the shortest scheduled flight in the world, where you get a certificate and a tiny bottle of whisky (or at least you used to).",

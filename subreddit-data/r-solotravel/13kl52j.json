    "postText": "I (22F)am looking into going on my first long term backpacking trip in fall from either oct-dec or oct-feb. Ideally I would love to go away for 5 to 6 months but I am TERRIFIED to be away from home for that long. The longest being 2.5 weeks, anyone have any advice or tips for taking that leap into your first long term travel AND by yourself. I do plan to take a month with a friend but for the most part I will be on my own. \n\nAs well how much you think is a good budget for 6 months through central and South America, is 8-10k a good budget for 6 months ??  I have wanted tp travel like this as long as I remember tho so I am super stoked but I'm not sure if 6 months is right. should I just start with 2-3? I just know I can get everything I want to do done in 6 months but not so sure about 2-3. I know this will be a journey of my lifetime but if I think too hard I get really anxious and nervous. tia",

Some tips:\n\n-Don't get drunk or get fucked up on drugs. Almost every South American horror story I've heard began with someone getting drunk. \n-Don't lend $ to anyone or start paying for other people's things\n-Don't walk around at night alone\n-When possible, flying is better than taking buses. Buses in South America are often delayed and nausea-inducing. \n-A great way to meet high-quality fellow travelers is to enroll in a language school, even just for a couple weeks. This weeds out the types of travelers who aren't serious about the culture, and the begpackers (since anyone paying for a language school most likely has enough $ of their own)",

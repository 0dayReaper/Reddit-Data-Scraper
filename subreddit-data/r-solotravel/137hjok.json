    "postText": "Hi, I am planning to do a South East Asia solo trip next January - including Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand.\n\nThe things I am looking for:\nAmazing affordable food, vibrant lively cities, great night life and partying, great party hostels.\n\nI have two potential itineraries:\n\nITINERARY 1:\n_____\n1. Fly into Hanoi airport\n2. Hanoi (2 night rest to recover from jet lag + 4 nights in the city)\n3. Then flight to Phnom Penh (expensive flights from Hanoi to Cambodia! Can be around 200 euros)\n4. Phnom Penh (3 nights)\n5. Then bus to Siem Reap\n6. Siem Reap (4 nights)\n7. Then bus to Bangkok \n8. Bangkok (6 nights)\n9. Fly to Koh Samui \n10. Koh Samui (1 night)\n11. Boat to Koh Phangan\n12. Koh Phangan + full moon party (3 nights)\n13. Boat to Koh Tao\n14. Koh Tao (3 nights)\n15. Boat to Koh Samui\n16. Flight to Bangkok\n17. Flight back home\n\nOr, ITINERARY 2:\n_____\n1. Fly into HCMC airport\n2. HCMC (2 night rest to recover from jet lag + 4 nights in the city)\n3. Then bus to Phnom Penh\n4. Phnom Penh (3 nights)\n5. Then bus to Siem Reap\n6. Siem Reap (4 nights)\n7. Then bus to Bangkok \n8. Bangkok (6 nights)\n9. Fly to Koh Samui \n10. Koh Samui (1 night)\n11. Boat to Koh Phangan\n12. Koh Phangan + full moon party (3 nights)\n13. Boat to Koh Tao\n14. Koh Tao (3 nights)\n15. Boat to Koh Samui\n16. Flight to Bangkok\n17. Flight back home\n\n\nItinerary 1 Advantages:\nIt seems the consesus that Hanoi is a \u201cbetter\u201d city than HCMC? So I get to visit a better city\n\nItinerary 1 disadvantages:\nHanoi is out of the way from Cambodia + Thailand, and the flights are too expensive (150-200 euros from Hanoi to Phnom Penh). Maybe it\u2019s best to do Hanoi on another trip?\n\nItinerary 2 Advantages:\nHCMC is bigger, so may be more lively / better food / better nightlife (???). Also a bus to Cambodia would be far cheaper than a flight\n\nItinerary 2 disadvantages:\nMiss out on Hanoi. Also I\u2019ve heard about corruption / visa issues of Vietnam-Cambodia border??\n\nTLDR: Should I start my SEA trip in Ho Chi Minh City and get the bus to Cambodia, or start in Hanoi and pay an expensive flight to Cambodia?",

Personally I'd suggest focusing on Thailand and Cambodia for this trip. Phnom Penh was interesting for a couple of days but can also be skipped if you prefer to spend your time elsewhere.\n\nFly into Bangkok, spend a few days checking out the city. Then maybe fly to Siem Reap (direct flights are frequent and the overland trip is a pain), then onto the islands, island hop etc. and then home from Bangkok (which is the cheap flight hub in the region anyway).  Since your priorities for this trip seem to be about partying, this would prioritize that.",

I also found it to be much more expensive than Hanoi so any savings on flight might disappear depending on how long you stay in the city.",

Vietnam is the sort of country where you need a month long trip and need to see it all, going to one city is a) pointless, you could save so much money by just going straight to Cambodia or Thailand and b) pointless, because the best bits of Vietnam are not those two cities, they\u2019re great but I\u2019d rather go to so many other places.\n\nLike others have said, Phnom Penh can be done in a day as it\u2019s not the liveliest city, but I would defo recommend going for the killing fields and S-21 museum. Bangkok is overrated in terms of nightlife, it\u2019s way too touristy and I haven\u2019t enjoyed a single night there. Granted you wanna do at least one night there but for what your looking for, you\u2019re probably better off spending more time down south.\n\nMy actual advice for you would be just do Thailand. Fly into Bangkok, go north for a week-ish and then go to the islands. A month isn\u2019t enough time to do SEA because you\u2019ll miss some of the best spots.",

It still has many interesting traditional sites\n\nYou visit Vietnam for the food, anyway. That was the highlight of my Vietnam visit. Getting Vietnamese coffee. Eating bahn mi every day. Just thinking of it makes me want to go back!\n\nThe trip that I planned started at Siem Reap, then night bus to PP and then another bus to Saigon. Through Reddit, I was able to organize a group of four to rent a van and driver/guide. We enjoyed a day tour of Angkor Wat -- which is cool, but personally, one day of that is enough for me. My second day focused on food (including Happy Pizza).\n\nThen it was off to Phnom Penh. I mainly remember visiting the market, and not much else.\n\nThen Saigon, which was a delight. I just love the vibe of that city. I really enjoy getting to know cities. Maybe it's not \"exotic\" enough for other people, but I don't care about that. I loved discovering cool cafes and eateries around Saigon. Of course, I also visited the war museum and a couple of art galleries.",

It's worked fine.\n\nAt busier places, I typically take up a chair or a couch at a shack/restaurant/club and ask the staff to look after the staff while I finish a swim. \n\nYou could simply buy a waterproof pouch for your phone and spare change as well, and keep it all on you while you swim too. That's an option I've recently started adopting more. But you will need to downsize the stuff you carry to the beach for sure, or be comfortable leaving them onshore.",

It was worth the extra money to not worry about my stuff. Granted many tourists I met said they left their stuff on a regular beach many times without incident\u2026 but I also met a woman whose daughter had her wallet and phone snatched from a beach. As a solo female traveler with anxiety I want to minimize my risk levels when possible.",

    "postText": "I am planning a month long trip to Scotland. I'll be in Portree for two weeks, during which I intend on taking day trips and exploring the Highlands. I want to spend a week in Edinburgh to see as many museums and galleries as possible. This leaves one free week. What do you recommend i do for the last week? My priority is art galleries, castles, national parks, museums, flowers etc.",

            "comment": "I'd say Cairngorms and Glencoe for more nature or more islands, suggestions below. Seconding visiting Glasgow, very different from Edinburgh. Naturally I don't know your age, if you are driving, or your activity level, but thought some input could be interesting. I spent some time on the islands and am going back this summer.\n\nPortree will be a good base for Skye, and Raasey. The pub at Carbost next to Tallisker used to have live traditional music many nights. \n\nKeep in mind that Skye gets extremely busy during the summer. Especially for getting around or back onto the island. Apparently traffic gets backed up and the bridge gets closed and only those with accommodation are let back onto the island at certain times. (Only been there outside of main season). Additionally if you want to see more of the islands it can be rather time consuming to get back to portree each time. The hebrideas are stunning and worth visiting imo. There are ferries from Uig to Uist and Lewis and Harris. I would opt to not go back to Potree every time though. Just getting back and forth to Tarbert will take over 5 hours out of your day 7 if you want to see drive to the Callenish standing stones or visit Stornoway, not counting time to see anything. \n\nPersonally I would divide my time with different accommodations rather than drive back, but maybe you are staying with friends. I would do about 5-6 nights in Portree if I were to include Raasey. Then I would stay in Stornoway for two nights to see Lewis and Harris, go down for the Uists and potentially Barra for a couple nights. Stay 3 nights in Oban and do hikes in Kerrera and Lismore those days, and then visit Mull, stay in Tobermory (which I preferred over Portree) and perhaps visit Ulva for another hike, visit Iona for history and take a boat tour to Staffa for Fingal's cave, puffins and a chance to see wildlife on the boat (saw a minky whale last year, still a highlight to me).",

From there, keep going up visit Dunnottar Castle and Drum Castle. Hit Aberdeen - go to Silver Darling for some of the best seafood. Then drive across the Cairngorms.",

    "postText": "I started my solo travel trip with the expectation of only 1.5 months in Colombia before returning home. 3 months later I\u2019m still here and about to fly to Peru. Recently I\u2019ve realised I wanted to work on a few personal projects and decided to buy a laptop in Bogot\u00e1.\n\nGiven this I thought I\u2019d document everything I found incase it\u2019s useful to others!\n\nLaptops here are slightly cheaper than the UK, but not much. \n\n\nApple retailers\n\u2014-\nThere are no official Apple stores, but there are several stores licensed to sell Apple products. They only have standard configurations, e.g. MacBook Air only comes with 8gb RAM. The guy in 1 store told me if I wanted a 16gb MacBook Air I\u2019d need to fly to the States!\n\nBoth fairly similar in terms of stock and prices. Staff were very helpful:\n- iShop\n- Mac Center\n\n\nWindows retailers\n\u2014-\nThese 2 both had a limited selection of cheap low-spec laptops for 1-2mil COP:\n- \u00c9xito\n- Pan Americana\n\nThese 2 appear to be the same store as their websites have the same stock, just different skins. The selection is bigger and includes some high-end gaming laptops. Price 1-15mil COP:\n- Ktronix\n- Alkosto \n\nI bought mine from the Alkosto hipermercado on Avenida 68 and the experience was super easy with my basic Spanish, and I think achievable with little/no Spanish.\n\n\nHigher risk/reward\n\u2014-\nThe other 2 options that came up were a bit out of my comfort zone, but you could get a great deal:\n- MercadoLibre - this seems like a Amazon marketplace-style (best comparison i can find!) platform where anyone can list. Some of the deals were great, you pay the cash and then get it delivered or for pickup. Colombian guy in my hostel bought a MacBook Pro m2 and was super happy\n- Unilago - it\u2019s a tech mall in Bogota. You\u2019d need to haggle and be comfortable with tech specs, but again you could get a great deal.\n\n\nI hope this saves somebody some time! Obviously be sensible with safety, get a taxi home rather than carrying an expensive looking box around the city.\n\nHappy shopping!",

I'm Canadian (and my current laptop is as well, with French on it) but my previous two laptops have been British and Korean and I don't think I ever noticed it once I changed the keyboard settings",

Yes, you can assign any layout you want\n\n\nUnderscore being where ? Is on US. \u00d1 being where ; is are probably the ones that would throw me the most.  Can't say I have symbols fully memorizes to type blind for them\n\nhttps://spanish411.net/images/SpanishKeyboardLayout.gif\n\n\nI can't stand UK layout,.enter is the wrong size. And backslash shares where the shift bar should be\n\nhttps://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0810/3669/files/uk-english_1024x1024.png?v=1510790021",

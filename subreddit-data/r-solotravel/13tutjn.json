    "postText": "Hello. Just want to say how much in awe I am of the people on this forum. Whether or not your solo trips were great, the fact that you stepped out of your comfort zone is achievement itself.\n\nThat's what I'm doing next month, and my heart is racing as I type this. Not because of the country I'm going to (seeing nothing but great things about Vietnam), but because of my own limitations. By which I mean:\n\n- My family doesn't know. I come from a cloistered home, so travelling solo for the first time to a foreign country is doubly nerve-wracking. But I'm also thrilled :)\n\n- How cloistered? I don't know how to drive or ride a scooter, leave alone a motorbike. I'd love to do the Ha Giang Loop but don't know how affordable it is to do a guided tour with a small group or alone.\n\n- To contextualise what I mean by \"affordable\", I cannot afford to spend more than INR 50,000 ($600) for the three weeks I'll be in the country. I'm flying in from India to HCMC, and departing from there as well. Meaning I'll have to go south to north and come back, and factor in that expense if I go ahead with this.\n\n- Unfortunately I haven't got leave from work, so connectivity is important. I can afford to be on the road for 3-4 days a week so long as I can access mobile data.\n\nI'm in two minds about my itinerary because of these 'basics'. My ideal route would be HCMC - Hoi An - Da Nang - Phong Nha - Hanoi - Cat Ba - Sapa or HG Loop (depending on my limitations), then back to Hanoi and HCMC directly from there. But I know three weeks is tight (ditto the money), so I'm open to devoting that to South Vietnam alone.\n\nSuggestions and brickbats welcome \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",

            "comment": "$600 for 3 weeks in Vietnam is barely doable. The cheapest Halong bay cruise tour (2 days/1 night) is 130 dollars but you can just do a day tour from Cat Ba island, I think you can get it for 35 dollars then. Ha Giang loop is about 170 dollars for 3 days/2 nights. So yeah I don\u2019t think you can afford any of the big tours and still stay on your budget. In your case it makes more sense to stay in the south of Vietnam and do some cheaper things: walking tours, hiking, museums, food markets, small boat tours. HCMN - Mui Ne - Da Lat - Hoi An - Da Nang - Hue - back to HCMN.",

I can't imagine getting any decent accommodation within 20k for 3 weeks. \n\nIf you're insisting on going, check out Hanoi. Both the city itself and the flights to reach it are slightly cheaper from any Indian city.",

For me it was about 240usd for 3 nights 4 days everything included with easy rider. \n\nYou'll be pretty connected with internet anywhere around the country if you go with viettel which is like $10-12USD for 3gb a day for a month worth. \n\nThe North is probably going to be better than the south, you could easily spend all your time there. \n\nI'm not sure if 600 is enough for 3 weeks with tours included tbh but everyone travels different so you might be able to do it. Cause food, accommodation,flights are pretty cheap overall only thing I spent a decent amount of money on was tours and I did heaps.",

No way OP can travel all the way from HoChiMinh to the north (which is expensive), take the Ha Giang loop for 240 dollars (which leaves him with 360 dollars for 3 weeks) and then travel all the way back to HoChiMinh and still not break the budget?

    "postText": "I (45M) had some time off over Memorial Day Weekend, so I decided to pop over to Barcelona from my home in Italy for some solo sight-seeing and Spanish food indulgence. I'm a fan of hostels on my trips for the social aspect and I enjoy meeting other travelers from around the world and hearing their stories, so for this trip I decided to try something new and take it up a notch by booking an unabashed \"party\" hostel - Kabul Party Hostel near La Rambla. \n\n**Friday**\n\nFlight got in at 1030 in the morning. I bought an AeroBus round-trip ticket from the airport to the city center (Placa Catalunya) for $12. I'm a big pre-planner, so I had an itinerary made in advance of places to see on a little self-guided walking tour. \n\n* **Museu d 'Hist\u00f2ria de la Ciutat (City History Museum)**: I enjoyed this museum, especially the Roman city ruins on the lower level. \n\n* **Roman Columns**: These are close to the museum, hidden in a back alley. \n\n* **Murals, statues and architecture - oh my!**: So much interesting things to see. I wandered around for a few hours just taking it all in.\n\n* **La Boqueria**: Big market. Sooo much food!\n\n* **Check into Hostel**: It was about 4 pm at this point, so I checked in, dropped off my backpack and went to the hostel bar for a cold beer - only to find the hostel bar didn't open until 6 pm! There was a vending machine that sold cans of beer, so I took one up to the rooftop terrace - only to find it empty of people. I thought this was supposed to be a party hostel?? Where *was* everyone? \n\nAround 6 pm people started arriving at the hostel bar or upstairs on the terrace, and I met a lot of other solo travelers. We played pool, foosball, etc. and the vibe was good. At 8 they had their nightly hostel activity, which was karaoke (I just watched). At 11 they did a pub crawl, but I went to bed because...I'm old.\n\n**Saturday**\n\nThe hostel actually provided a breakfast buffet, and I practically had it all to myself at 8 am because everyone was still asleep. The only others were people who'd been out all night and this was a late night snack for them. \n\n* **Sagrada Fam\u00edlia**: I'd pre-booked a 9:30 entrance ticket thinking I'd beat the crowds, but it was still pretty crowded. I imagine later in the day would be a madhouse. I did the Passion Tower also. \n\n* **Park Guell**: Google maps told me it was only a 2km walk, and the weather was really nice so I went on foot. Turns out it was all uphill! The park was neat, but super crowded. \n\n* **The Beach!**: I took a taxi back from the park to the hostel and changed for the beach. It was around noon at this point, but a lot of the people in my 22-bed room were still sleeping. It was weird tip toeing around mid-day in the room. On the way to Barceloneta Beach I stopped for lunch at Can Paixano, a standing-only tapas bar. It was amazing. I ate a ton of different types of tapas and made friends with a Canadian couple that stood near me. Between the 3 of us, we had 3 full bottles of Cava, which is a Spanish sparkling wine. \n\nAt the beach, I set up my towel next to a family with kids, and asked them to watch my things when I went in the water. I was there most of the afternoon and really enjoyed it, but it was very crowded and people were always walking by trying to sell stuff (I did buy a few mojitos, lol). The weather was perfect (83F/28C).\n\nThat night at the hostel I befriended a solo traveler who was in his late 20's and told me he felt \"old\" at this particular hostel. The clientele at Kabul definitely skewed young, like 18-21 young. It was awkward hearing the stories of the American kids amazed that they could gamble at the Barcelona Casino, or buy sangria at a bar without being carded. But outside the generational differences, they were laid back and fun to hang out with. \n\n**Sunday**\n\nI slept in a little, then after breakfast I took the cable car up Montju\u00efc. It had some nice views. The guy I met the night before texted and asked me to meet him at Casa Battlo, so I headed over that way. \n\nHe had hooked up with a girl staying at the hostel the night before, and now was stuck escorting her and her friend around the city. They'd just paid $35 to go inside Casa Battlo, and he needed a wingman. I was content waiting outside (The Gaudi tourist stops are overpriced imho). \n\nI spent the next few hours watching this new couple who'd just met and drunkenly hooked up only the night before try to play \"couple\" - holding hands etc. but it was painful to watch them try their best to get along sober when it clearly would've been best to leave it as a one night stand. \nI went back to the hostel and took a nap, and later that night the four of us went out for dinner and walked around the beachfront area. All this time I wasn't a very good double date for the other girl because: 1. I have a girlfriend back home 2. I was all-too-aware I had two decades on this girl, and any simple niceties or innocent flirting could easily be misconstrued as me being a creepy old man. Maybe that was just in my head, but those are legitimate feelings at my age. I went to bed around Midnight as they left to go clubbing.\n\n**Monday**\n\nCheckout was 11, but my flight wasn't until 6 pm, so I spent my final day souvenir shopping, exploring the back alleys of the gothic quarter alone, and sitting on a bench on La Rambla listening to street performers play Spanish music. It was a nice relaxing day. Around 2 I got a text from my new friend that he'd just woken up and wanted me to come back to the hostel to hang out with him and the girls. I declined. \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nWould I stay at Kabul Party Hostel again? No, but I'm glad I went and held my own with the young people. I knew I'd be out of place, but it ended up being fun. I played foosball, pool, beer pong and watched the Barcelona soccer match on tv while sharing multiple pitchers of sangria with interesting young people from all over the world. \n\nI loved Barcelona and was lucky to have great weather while there. The food was really good and not too expensive. I didn't get pickpocketed despite all the warnings. I was able to navigate public transportation on my own, and I learned some new Catalan phrases. \n\nWhen my plane touched down at Venice Airport that night, my phone pinged with several missed texts. My hostel friend had written to say the other girl was asking about me and told him she would've hooked up if only I'd tried harder. I assumed they were a few drinks deep at the hostel bar by that point. Maybe it was the sangria talking, but hearing she'd liked me felt good, and was the perfect end to my solo trip to Barcelona.",

Honestly sounds like you had a ball despite the potentially iffy premises.\n\nThough, there's no amount of money saving that would make me stay in a 22-bed dorm. Actually, not even if somebody paid me. 12 was the largest I've stayed in (and it was back in my early 20s...) and nope, never again.",

There were a lot of big events going on in Barcelona that weekend and rooms were scarce. \n\nI'll continue to stay in hostels because I love the social factor, but no more like Kabul.

I would imagine you'd still get the party vibes in smaller sized rooms, after all that's what the common spaces are for. I've been to a few party hostels in the past and that was usually the case, never so much the rooms per se (and even in 6/8 rooms I could always chat people up easily if need be).\n\nBut props to you for subjecting yourself to that experiment, especially at that price, and surviving!",

I\u2019m approaching late 20s as well and sometimes I meet a 19 year old and I\u2019m like \u2018damn this kid is young.\u2019\n\nThen I think back to the time when I was 19 and backpacking also and what the mid 20s people I was hanging out with was thinking about me at the time. I even spent some time with someone your age back in 2015, American guy and we talked about a bunch of stuff including American politics, which I, as a 19 year old from Asia, had no clue about. It always trips me out how I managed to get along with people of all ages when I was that young and honestly it says a lot about the open mindedness of solo travellers in general. Definitely opened up my worldview :)\n\nCan\u2019t wait to go proper solo travelling again next year! I\u2019ll be going to Europe this summer but mostly to visit friends I haven\u2019t seen since pre Covid so not really counted, but I\u2019m saving up more money and can\u2019t wait to see stuff and meet folk!",

I think hostels in Europe can defs have room for older folks who want to be more sociable but but I think we've gotten out a lot of using the private rooms where you can certainly exit awkward situations and dynamics that are easy to find in hostels lol. Also going to see you music in another country has been a great way to socialize too :)",

As a 37y/o who's never stayed in a hostel before I've been worrying I'm at the age where the experience could go either way but after reading this I'm much more confident about it!",

Because my sleep schedule was different than the majority of people there, the room was empty at midnight when I went to sleep (everyone was out doing whatever) and when I woke up (8-9:30 am) everyone was passed out sleeping so I had the showers/bathrooms all to myself.",

Just went on my first trip to Spain last month, did the similar solo tourist/party hostel life, but at 29, even I felt a bit old compared to most of the other young 20 year olds.",

Her job requires frequent business travel (international finance), and during her work trips I like to take my own solo trips to European cities I've never been to before, and she supports that. \n\nWhy would I jeopardize all that to hook up with a rando at a hostel? Cost/risk/reward ratio isn't worth it. \n\nThe agreement I have with my partner is this: I can solo travel only to cities she's already been to. I'm American and she's Italian, so she's had a lifetime to see Europe, and I have a long list of places I've never been. Our relationship is built on trust, and so far it's worked.",

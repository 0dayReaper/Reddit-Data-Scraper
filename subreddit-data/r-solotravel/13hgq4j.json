    "postText": "TL;DR - solo female uni student needing volunteering/ chemistry degree related travel ideas for a travel grant application, ideally outside Europe.\n\nHey, I'm a university student (20F) and my uni offers a grant of up to \u00a32000 to support 'worthwhile travel' that meets one of the following criteria:  \n1. Social Development  \n2. Intellectual or Personal Development  \n3. Academic development (but not labs, conferences or archives) - priority is given to travel supporting academia.\n\nThis is the last year of uni in which I have the opportunity to apply but I'm absolutely stuck for ideas. Any volunteering opportunities seem either too unsafe for someone who's never travelled alone, or are paid 'voluntourism' which don't feel ethical. I'm studying chemistry, and I can't find anything that's related to that either - a chemistry equivalent of CERN in Switzerland would be fantastic.   Any ideas would be much appreciated!",

            "comment": "The exclusion of labs is strange and erases a lot of options - so many of my classmates spent summers working/volunteering/visiting other professors in their field, connections they made just by emailing their lab asking to visit and learn from their findings. Does  \u201csupporting academia\u201d refer to your own academic endeavors or academia as in like contributions to the greater field? With chemistry it\u2019ll be pretty hard to do the latter without labs because hard sciences pretty much require the lab environment to yield results\u2026 this grant seems a bit biased towards social sciences where you can do things like ethnographic research etc. \n\nDo you have any other interests outside of chemistry? Things like the arts, languages, history etc. If you\u2019ve taken any auxiliary classes or clubs for fun you can spin that into a tale and pursue that further for field research. It\u2019s hard to give specific ideas because you\u2019ll probably have to elaborate more on it in your grant application, and you\u2019ll be able to be more persuasive the more passionate you are about the subject matter.",

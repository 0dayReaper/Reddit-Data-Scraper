Back in the 1980 and 90s, getting meds and vitamins I needed in Asia and Europe was challenging. That's no longer the case. \n\nMy advice fwiw is: pack almost nothing and ask your muy thai partners to direct you to whatever you need locally. If it's good enough for them (the pros!), it should work for you too. And buying it in Thailand will be inexpensive, supports local businesses, and insures you won't be delayed by suspicious Customs Officials.",

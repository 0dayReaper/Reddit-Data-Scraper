Usually the younger crowd would head to South East Asia but \n- many college students around the world are on summer break \n- getting closer to rainy season in Asia \n- europe too expensive \n\nJust thinking I don\u2019t know honestly. In the Philippines right now and everyone I meet in hostel are 18-22 max.",

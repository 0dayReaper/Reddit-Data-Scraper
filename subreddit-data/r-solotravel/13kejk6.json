    "postText": "I feel so stupid for making this mistake.\n\nUsually when you get off a bus there\u2019s tons of guys there asking where you\u2019re going, trying to get you on their bike. I\u2019ve been in Vietnam for 3 weeks and every time this happens I ignore them, go on my way and call myself a grab.\n\nI just arrived in Nha Trang at 4AM. No one else on my sleeper bus just me. Got off and there was the normal, couple guys trying to get me on their bikes. I stupidly don\u2019t have a USB charger (only USBC) so couldn\u2019t charge my phone on the bus and it was dead. Instead of ignoring the guy I said \u201cI need to charge my phone, idk where I\u2019m going\u201d he\u2019s like Ah ok let\u2019s go! Grabs my bag and puts it on his bike.\n\nI\u2019m like, wait how much? He\u2019s like don\u2019t worry, free! I\u2019m like ah what a nice old man! Nope. 4AM clearly I\u2019m not thinking straight after a 9+ hour bus ride.\n\nWe stop at some cafe to charge my phone. He hands me a cigarette, asks me where I\u2019m from, we communicate the best we can. All the time his buddy is following us on his bike. I\u2019m thinking ah nice guys, helping a tourist out! Phone turns on, show him my hostel, he\u2019s like ah let\u2019s go!\n\nAgain, I\u2019m like how much? He\u2019s like free! I\u2019m like wow what a nice old man!\n\nGet to my hostel. In total I\u2019d say we drove for under 5 minutes on his bike. Again, I\u2019m like how much? I know he said free but obviously ima give this nice man someth-\n\n\u201c500k!\u201d\n\nBruh. Scammed. I\u2019m like come on you said free? How about 200? He\u2019s like NO! 500k!\n\nI\u2019m like fuck, whatever. It\u2019s 4am, no one around, just me him and his buddy. I hand him a 500k bill. He turns around and says \u201cI SAY 500, YOU GIVE ME 20! 500!\u201d\n\nHands me back a 20k bill. I\u2019m like bro what? I just gave you 500!\n\n\u201cNO YOU GIVE ME 20! 500!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m standing here with my wallet, IPhone 14 PM, passport, so I\u2019m like fuck this, and fuck you. Hand him another 500 and walk away.\n\nDon\u2019t get scammed like me. Fuck all the dudes waiting at the bus stops. Nothing is free. Shouldn\u2019t have let my guard down. Oh well, could have been much worse, I got off easy.",

I sadly declined despite knowing it was rather normal in the country to hitchhike. Very sorrowful to miss out on a spontaneous experience like that, but better to play it safe. Talking to other solo female travelers at the hostel later, I learned many of them had actually hitchhiked and had the best times! I was like, \u201cgirl you\u2019re brave but that is not for me\u201d \ud83d\ude02",

I'd say as a general rule I avoid rides from young men or if there is more than one person in the car (especially if the other person is a female or a child) I'm more inclined to accept a ride. I often offer rides in the US for thru-hikers as that's a normal part of the culture. And sometimes in a foreign country it might be easier logistically to try to get a ride from someone to/from a trailhead.",

We didn\u2019t know if there was a ride or if we were all on our own even though the website said we would get dropped off at our hotel. It was so confusing.  There were men in front of the station acting like they worked there and would take us to our hotel. We eventually asked the driver of the shuttle bus who was lingering around and he let us know he would be doing the rest of the drop offs to the hotel for free.  No official workers offered us that information if we hadn\u2019t asked.  No one shooed away the vultures waiting at the station for tourists.",

But this doesn't really seem that dangerous, especially already being at your hostel and the guy is older. Vietnam is quite safe usually too and assuming you're a western guy you're probably much bigger than them as well. \n\nI always stand firm on this kind of stuff and have a reasonable price in mind already. If they say \"free\" then they should expect to be held to their word (they know damn well what they're saying) and anything beyond that is my generosity. You didn't owe that scammer anything once they revealed themselves to be scamming, especially not another 500k. Just walk away. If you really feel obligated to give someone like that money, give them roughly what you'd have paid normally + 10-20% more. \n\nStuff like this makes it worse for the rest of us since they harass all the foreigners expecting a huge payday since some guy decided to give in to their nonsense and give them 1 million VND for what should've been 30,000 VND max.",

                    "comment": "This guy's story was absolutely painful to read. People like this guy are exactly why these scams exist in the first place. It's really simple- just say no. You are literally outside your hostel with hostel staff right by the door. Y'all need to learn that the police will absolutely take your side in every one of these situations with barely any questions asked, and the scammers know this too. Just say no and threaten to call the police. 9 times out of ten they will back down and ask for the normal fare. If not, you go inside and tell the staff to call the police. \n\nThey won't do shit to you. If they assaulted you outside a hostel because you didn't agree to getting robbed (this never happens), the police would absolutely tear up the city looking to destroy those guys. Tourism is a river of gold, and they sure as hell are going to protect that revenue stream over some loser criminals. \n\nThat being said, the worst thing you can do is puff out your chest and get aggressive like some wannabe tough guys in this thread are suggesting. Acting visibly aggressive is a massive social faux pas in South east Asia and you will lose good will with the police and locals very quickly- people who otherwise will always take your side. Stay calm, say no, go inside, ask for help. They will fuck off real quick.\n\n(This advice does not necessarily apply in places like South America).",

Loads of guys trying to get me on their tuk tuk. I had already arranged for a collection with my hotel so politely refused and waited for my ride.\n\nOne guy named Tony stuck around to chat to me. He knew I was waiting for another ride, just wanted to chat about where I'd come from and get to know me. 20 minutes pass and my ride from the hotel hadn't showed up, so I asked Tony if he would mind taking us. \"No problem\" he said. Took the trip to my hotel and asked how much. Tony said \"nothing my friend\". We had discussed some day trips but I hadn't committed to anything yet. I paid him 1USD for the trip anyway, but he really didn't want to take my money.\n\nI took his WhatsApp number and said I'd text him later if I decided to do some day trips. Reflected that night on what an incredibly kind man he was and decided to book 2 day trips with him. Some of the best days out of my whole trip. After these day trips, he would tell me if I needed a ride from battambang Town centre to my hotel any time, just let him know. I called him a couple of times and he always gave me a ride, told me that the ride was free, and then I'd pay him 1usd anyways. Genuinely one of the most wholesome experience of my trip and made me reasses my opinion of the tuk tuk/bike \"mafia\" that greet you upon arrival. Ultimately they are just desperate people trying to earn a living, but not all of them are trying to screw you over.",

I had no plans when I arrived in Da Lat so I was game for it. I hopped on and the first stop was a gondola across the city. I had to leave my bag with the motorcyclist as I got on the gondola. The motorcyclist says he'll meet me at the other end of the gondola with my bag. Thats when this whole thing felt sus. I'm such an idiot for leaving my bag with him and getting on the gondola. \n\nBy some miracle the motorcyclist shows up at the other end of the gondola with my bag! He totally could have ran off with it. \n\nWe continue a 3-4 day tour across the country with me on the back of his motorcycle and I got to see/experience Vietnam that most tourist don't get to see. It was such a memorable experience! I'm so fortunate that it turned out well but I wouldnt recommend doing what I did and leaving your bag like I did.",

            "comment": "Sorry to hear that happen, but do remember that you really only paid $20ish dollars USD for that, which isn't the end of the world. So don't beat yourself up about it. I experienced a few incidents like this when I was in Vietnam over a month, but I also experienced some genuine help.\n\nThe first one, I had been in Vietnam for about a week and still had my guard high up worried about scammers, I had run into a bunch in Hanoi which was the first city I went to when I entered the country. \n\nI nearly got scammed by a taxi in Hanoi but was able to get out of it, I basically held firm to the price we agreed on, gave him the money, and left the taxi. I can elaborate on that one more if you'd like.\n\nI got scammed in Hue, by hiring a river boat to take me to see some of the tombs and temples on the river, they basically made it sound like they would just boat me over to the attractions, I'd get out look around, and then jump back in the boat, moving on to the next attraction.\n\nBut instead they took me to the pagoda on the river, but after that they took me to some empty shore where a motorcycle guy picked me up and took me to the rest, and I had to pay him in addition to the boat captain. He also kind of jerked me around to. Anyway he returned me to the boat after, and I was pissed, on our way back to where I had hired the boat, they tried to sell me some kitschy crap I wasn't interested in.  \n\n\nInitially I was angry, but then I did the conversion and found they had \"ripped\" me off for $26 CAD. On top of that I noticed they had a baby on the boat and came to the realization that this boat was also their home. After that I still looked out for scams but wasn't as upset when they happened.\n\nAnd I did get \"scammed\" after that a couple of times, but in hindsight it was no big deal.\n\nThe one time they genuinely helped me, I was in Phu Quoc, I had rented a motorcycle to see the island, and ended up in a remote part. My tire went flat, and I had no one to call and no spare and I was in middle of literally nowhere. Luckily a couple in a tuk tuk that had a flatbed at the back came around the corner after like 10 minutes, they stopped, they didn't really speak English but it didn't matter cause the problem was easy to see. We ended up putting my motorcycle on the flatbed, he took me into the small seaside town that the road was leading to. The locals had a laugh because they just saw these two roll into two with their tuk tuk with a motorcycle on the back that I was holding to prevent it from falling over. They fixed my tire, I obviously paid the shop that fixed the tire, and gave the couple that rescued me like $30 CAD in Dong, they didn't ask for it but without them I would have been really screwed.\n\nThe difference between the two stories, and something I found while travelling SEA for 3 months is you're more likely to get scammed in the more touristy areas, they attract scammers looking for \"rich\" foreigners, but in the non touristy areas they just want to help and don't have any ulterior motives.\n\nHope this helps",

Call the hostel workers, open up your translator app, and tell them what happened.\n\n\nTwo people tried to scam me at different times in Vietnam.\n\nOne was in HCMC. Met this girl on Tinder and we went to a cafe. Normal flirty conversation, I pay and we agree to go back to my place. Stop at 7/11 and she buys beer. Go upstairs, have a drink, talk, and have sex all night. After a few hours I tell her I need to go to sleep so I can wake up early for work. She says ok, and then tells me I need to pay her $100. I was completely caught off guard, because we never discussed payment for sex. Not a single time. I had no idea she was like that. Just thought she was a normal girl.\n\nI tell her that I'm not going to pay her anything and that she needs to leave immediately. She says she's not leaving until I pay. We go back and forth for about 15 minutes and things get pretty heated. She is just sitting on the couch and refusing to leave until I pay her. \n\nI had no idea what to do, so I called the AirBnB host and told him what was happening. He came over immediately and told the girl that she had no right to demand that I pay her being that we never discussed money before having sex. He negotiated with her for like 30 minutes and she refused to back down. \n\nAt one point, I even caught her trying to steal my second cell phone that was sitting on the table next to the couch.\n\nThe host gave up on her and eventually tried to convince me to give her $50 justto make her leave. But I refused.\n\nAfter a while, I decided that I was just going to pack my bags and leave to find a hotel. So i packed everything and was ready to walk out, which upset both the girl and the AirBnB host. \n\nHe begged me to just give her something and she might leave. Being that I didn't actually want to leave to find a hotel, I suggested that I would give her $10 to pay for the beer that she bought at 7/11. \n\nTo my surprise, she agreed. I gave her the $10 and she started walking out. I was cursing her out and calling her all sorts of names, and she was yelling right back at me.\n\nThat actually kinda freaked me out because I was imagining this girl having some crazy Vietnamese gangster friends who might fuck me up but I never heard from her again.\n\n----------------\n\n\nThe second time I almost got scammed was at a gas station near Da Nang. \n\nThe guy finished filling up my tank, tells me the price, and I handed him a large bill, expecting to get change.\n\nHe gave me change and I was in a hurry so I put it in my pocket. Then I thought to myself, hmm, I should probably have counted the change since it was from a large bill and the gas wasn't that much.\n\nI took out the money and counted it, and realized that the gas station employee shorted me about 500,000.\n\nI took out my translator app and wrote in there, \"I gave you 1 million dong, and you didn't give me the correct change. You still owe me 500,000\"\n\nHe tried to play dumb and act like nothing happened, so then I turned on the speaker for the translator app, and started playing it loudly so that all the other people at the gas station could hear. I wrote in the translator app, \"This man is trying to steal money from me.\" \n\nEveryone heard and he got really embarrassed and gave me back the money he owed me.",

In these countries people don't have social security, pensions, 401K or health benefits. The locals I met in Cambodi were poor but were left absolutely impoverished by the pandemic.\n\nNot sure where you are from but perhaps you are rich by comparison. Not saying I support the scamming tourist approach but sometimes locals need to be opportunistic to survive. It sucks and I have been scammed. \n\nYou got plenty of advice about the late nights. Nothing good happens between 12am and 5am! Lol.\n\nEnjoy your stay and have fun! Don't let the scammers bring you down.",

You take a taxi, they scam you with a rigged meter, you get to the hotel you booked on [Booking.com](https://Booking.com), they tell you it is fully booked, but their brother runs a hotel that is just as good. You check out of the hotel, 3 days later you get an email from [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) where the owner claimed you did not show up. You are approached by someone, who offers you a sight-seeing trip by scooter across town. It costs 3 dollars. After 20 minutes of driving they bring you to the outskirts of the city and bribe 50$ out of you to bring you back.\n\nWill never go back.",

The sightseeing tour thing is a thing is a lot of countries, never take any tour you didn\u2019t pre book online or through your hostel. I didn\u2019t have any trouble booking hostels or anything else either.

Similar things happen over there although I've been quite lucky, the worst thing to happen to me is being over charged for say a ride from the airport to a hotel in the city centre. But the overcharging is common in most situations over there.\n\nMy last few trips were better, I ever made sure I booked with a hotel that offered free airport pickup - this is great as it prevents any random driver from getting lost if he has no idea where your hotel is. If the free pickup option wasn't available, I would use the pre paid taxi booth, which is another okay option, but the drivers tend not to speak too much English. I usually get approached by unlicensed drivers  coming out of the arrivals hall, but always tell them to get lost",

I glanced away as he counted because I knew I gave him the correct amount. He was surprised and said \"We said fifteen, you only gave me nine!\" He fanned out the bills to show to me. I was SURE I have him the exact right amount, but I must have made a mistake and gave him another six. \n\nAfter I started walking, I ran the scenario through my head and realized I had absolutely given him fifteen. He just slipped away six while I wasn't looking and earned himself a sweet tip.\n\nI prepared myself for the next time this happened. I would say \"Only nine? Let me see!\" and take the bills from him to count. \"You're sure I only gave you nine?\" He would nod. \"And we said fifteen, so how much more do I owe you?\" He'd tell me six, so I would count out six bills and hand it to him. \"There you go! Bye bye!\"\n\nOf course it never happened again. Still, it was fun to play 'what if.'",

    "postText": "Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not a hopeless romantic - in fact I am the opposite, having been single for years and years I\u2019ve never found myself quite connected to anyone.\n\nRecently I travelled and stayed in a hostel. This one guy - he works there, and also newly arrived from where he previously stayed. While he was physically attractive I never paid much attention to him, in fact thought he was quite an oddball.\n\nOver the next few days I\u2019ve seen him around almost every night at the lounge - I have sleep issues so I sit around to read late at night. But we never talked to each other, nothing more than a nod of acknowledgement.\n\nOn my last night, I was at the hostel\u2019s bar with my other friends and he too with his friends. I thought that was the most alive I\u2019ve seen him.\n\nAfter the bar closes, almost like a ritual I went to the lounge and he came up too. This time we all spoke, and after my friends left it was just me and him again, like the past few days.\n\nI told him it was my last night here and lamented about how it was still too early; he asked if I wanted to go for a walk but commented that there was \u201cnothing else opened\u201d. I thought it was a rejection and when I was picking up my stuff ready to leave, he asked, \u201cdo you play chess?\u201d\n\nWe then spent the next few hours playing chess - I wasn\u2019t quite familiar with the rules and he had to guide me (I\u2019m sorry!). \n\nOnce the game ended we sat in silence, both delirious I guess as it was late, and also from the alcohol earlier. Funny how it\u2019s only until now he asked for my name and I realized I knew nothing about him too - so we started talking, and talking.\n\nI told him he had a good side profile. He blushed and I teased him for being shy. He asked for my social media, and when I gave him my Instagram he looked up my photos and held his phone next to my face and said they\u2019re cute. (I know it\u2019s super cringe I am sorry redditors bear with me here)\n\nAnd then it was getting late and I guess it was finally time to go. We hugged goodbye and I thought that was that.\n\nThe next morning I queued up for the famous donuts before my flight and since he said he\u2019s never had them before I got one for him too. I was in a rush, so I labeled it with his name and passed it to the reception\u2026. But embarrassingly enough I bumped into him in the lobby. We talked for a bit before he got called by some other guy, and I silently made my way to my room and then checked out.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the point of this post is, I barely knew him, it\u2019s just another night, he was just another guy - and more importantly, I must have been just another guest, one of the many he\u2019s met working there - and that I will probably and hopefully get over it soon.\n\nAnd I do know this is quite silly to share with my friends and I probably sound like a teenage girl in love for the first time.\n\nBut I guess for now - I do remember that night very fondly and wish we spoke earlier. I also remember that feeling of wanting to kiss him - for someone like me who does not like affection much, that feeling was new to me and keeps me warm inside.",

I reckon you just met someone who has that energy for you!",

            "comment": "Moments like these do tend to be pretty meaningful.\n\nI once had a similar experience where I kept ending up being in the same place as a girl during my Taiwan trip a few years back and we would hang out together. We connected extremely well and I have to admit by the end I was quite smitten. We both had just started a new relationship back home before we left so we both were hesitant to make the first move because things are strong but not too strong to technically cheat on our partners (no matter how new they were), so when it came to the point where we knew for sure our schedules wouldn't line up again, we just had a big hug and went our separate ways, never taking things further. We almost thought of rearranging our trips to spend it all together, but it was a fleeting desire.\n\nI think travel in general leaves you more open to those kind of experiences. You are already in the mindset of wanting new adventures, and your typical daily worries of a job or the annoyances of trying to live in a city day to day are gone - you are just spending money and having fun.\n\nLikewise, I try not to get obsessed with worrying about a \"what if\" because of that. Maybe if we had gotten together and spent more time with each other, it would have been an amazing time. Or maybe it would eventually lead to us starting to find normal relationship pet peeves with each other once normal lives and pressures started coming into the picture and we would have a sour ending memory of each other instead of a romantic one.",

We need to accept the fact that every one we meet or spend time with is not meant to be there forever. We feel sad because we associate a 'forever' with the person and then dread at the thought of losing them. Normalise having a great time with someone without the expectation of having a future with them.\nSometimes a person is special in your life because unknowingly they may have carved a path for you to discover yourself.\n\nAppreciate their presence for that brief acquaintance. Live in the moment and instead of thinking about a definite relation with them, enjoy their company.",

            "comment": "I met Mrs. Cryospam on vacation on the opposite side of the planet from my home. \n\nA buddy and I flew to Bali on mispriced tickets we found (400 bucks round trip).\n\nOn the advice of another friend who had been here, we hired a local instead of a full tour company. \n\nAfter talking to her over WhatsApp for a while, I made her a deal, if she gave us a ride from Kuta to Ubud on Saturday, (we had a week's stay booked there) then we would hire her for tours for Monday and Tuesday.  She agreed, but only if we paid for the tours in advance (she told me afterwards that she thought we were going to blow her off). \n\nFlat out that ride changed my life. My buddy sat in the front seat and she and I sat in the back and just talked about all kinds of stuff, hobbies, interests, differences in culture and family expectations (she isn't from Bali, rather a much more rural and conservative part of Indonesia) and before we knew it we were at Ubud. \n\nWe paid her and she left, and that night I told my buddy that there was something about her, I just couldn't figure out what, but I felt comfortable, we shared a bunch of common hobbies (I had asked her first so I know she hadn't just repeated mine) and she was just a super cool chick. \n\nMonday rolled around and we started doing tours with her and her driver. We did the standard set of places you go see in Bali (rice terrace, tanah lot, monkey forest, a coffee plantation, places for Instagram pictures, etc) but for me that wasn't the highlight of the trips, it was getting to know her a bit better, we laughed about parental expectations, and how even though on opposite sides of the planet with parents from immensely different cultures...that shit was the same. We talked about life aspirations, where we wanted to be 5 or 10 years from now, and more often than not, when I asked her a question first, her answers were absolutely in line with what I would have said had she asked the question of me.  Two days worth of trips turned into spending the week together, I gave her my bedroom in the place we rented in Ubud and I slept on the second bed in my buddy's room and her driver crashed in the third bedroom. \n\nWhen we got back to Kuta, where our second week was planned I dragged her and her driver out with us to all the tourist places that are just priced outside of reasonable for a local here, her friends met us out and I could tell based on how they treated me, I was being vetted the same way I would have helped to vet a guy one of my female friends told me she was interested in. We had an awesome second week together, during which time I refused to sleep with her, and I told her I'd come back, but that I had to settle some things at home, and I thanked her for an amazing trip. \n\nWe never fell out of touch, and talked literally every day, sometimes for hours. I was dating someone with whom I felt obligated to break it off with in person out of respect rather than being that asshole cheater. We hadn't been a super strong couple to begin with, but I felt that if I was going to make a play for this Indonesian girl, I had to do it starting from a good place. \n\nThree months after I got back, I got a sizable quarterly profit sharing bonus at work, so I begged my boss to let me fly back but for longer, at first he was a bit skeptical, but when I told him about future Mrs. Cryospam, he laughed at me and just signed off on 4 more weeks of PTO and wished me the best of luck.\n\nI came back and spent a month with her this time, and during this trip, I had realized that I had never met a woman with whom I felt so instantly comfortable with, it just felt right in a weird way that I couldn't describe.  It was during this trip when I decided to ask her if she wanted to be Mrs. Cryospam and she said yes. \n\nThe third trip (again like 3 months later) involved me hiring a local fixer and flying to super rural Indonesia to negotiate with her dad for her hand in marriage. Holy balls was I terrified, but his only major concern was that this was a permanent thing, once done we weren't going to back out.  We came to an agreement about what I would contribute to the wedding expenses, and that we couldn't legally marry in Indonesia, as the visa process for her to come to the US was massively easier as my fiancee, and then for us to immediately legally marry in the US, then report that marriage to the Indonesian consulate. \n\nTwo more trips later, (3 months apart) we had an amazing ceremony in her village, and almost 1000 people showed up. My friend who accompanied me on the first trip and one of my oldest friends came with me, my brother's mother in law died just before he would have left so he couldn't come, and neither of my parents were in good enough health to make the trip. It was really hard leaving that time, but a visa is only for so long...and I had to work. \n\nShe finally got her appointment to do her final interview in Jakarta at the US consulate, so I flew back to be there to support her through her interview. This was about when all the Covid shit was JUST starting, so when they issued her Visa, we moved my plane tickets up, bought her a one way ticket and flew back to Boston. \n\nShe's been Mrs. Cryospam since 2019, and I am happier than I have ever been anytime in my life. \n\nDon't just ignore the connections that click for reasons you can't explain, if there is a spark that's different...make sure to stay in touch. It may just be the best decision you will ever make.",

            "comment": "Something like this happened to me \u2014 I tried to follow up on it, and unfortunately it sort of tainted the experience a little. \n\nI met a guy at a weeklong training for work in another state about 9 years ago. There were probably like 50 people there, all of us in our early 20s, all from different parts of the US. I\u2019m not a love-at-first sight kind of gal, but I was pretty much immediately smitten with this person. At the time, I was still very heartbroken over my a major break-up from the year before, and this guy was the first person I\u2019d felt a true connection with since then. I won\u2019t bore you with the details, but on our last night, before we all departed for our respective homes, almost all of us were hanging out in the conference room of our hotel late into the evening. Me and the guy were lying on the ground underneath a grand piano, just listening to people chat and taking turns playing songs. At that point, nothing romantic had actually happened between us yet, and I was starting to internally panic about the prospect of parting ways without doing *something* to express whatever it was that I was feeling. Somehow I managed to gather all of my courage and leaned in to kiss him\u2026and he kissed me back. It was a perfect moment. \n\nSadly, things didn\u2019t go much further than that. He was based in Pittsburgh, PA and I was in Gainesville, FL at the time. We exchanged some lovely letters and sporadically texted in the months following the training. Almost a year after we met, I bought a plane ticket to visit him, but about two weeks before my flight, he called me to let me know that he had met someone else that he wanted to pursue seriously and that he didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be a good idea for me to visit. It really threw me for a loop, and I was so heartbroken. \n\nAnyway, I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that it sounds like you made a pretty perfect memory. You connected deeply and inexplicably with a stranger over the course of an incredibly limited amount of time. Everything that happened between the two of you was full of promise (and if you never meet again, it always will be) and dude that is just the best feeling. \n\nBut yah for sure you should definitely follow up with your guy if the feeling strikes. I don\u2019t necessarily regret trying to keep things going in my situation, but now, whenever he crosses my mind, rather than focus on how sad I was when it ended, I like to think about that night under the piano.",

Spent the next few evenings together. She\u2019s also not the type of girl who would ever do that, but we were very comfortable with eachother. I\u2019ve been back to see her 3 times and she just spent the last 2 weeks with me at my house, and I\u2019m arranging my next visit to see her in a month or so. So, it\u2019s inconvenient, but we had an incredible connection, and we\u2019re making it work. We\u2019re both aware it probably won\u2019t last, but something beautiful isn\u2019t beautiful because it lasts forever. Maybe try reaching out and see what happens? You never know",

It was a 5-minute walk and I was on the way to my hostel as well so I guided her and we chatted about some random stuff for like 5 minutes but it felt great.  I remember thinking she was so beautiful when she smiled. When we reached her hostel, we hugged and I said \"I'll see you around\" and she said, \"Yes! For sure\". As I left, I realized that I hadn't even asked her for her name. I really wanted to meet her though, so I hung around a few times in a caf\u00e9 near her hostel hoping we'd bump into each other but it didn't happen. I would've loved to meet her again but I was only there for a couple more days so I couldn't. I still cherish that 5 min walk we had.",

I\u2019m now married with a little one on the way, but in my 20s, I did some solo traveling and had a lot of these little \u201cromance\u201d stories where you just have an amazing wonderful night with someone and then just leave and never see them again. \n\nTwo of the more memorable ones were when I went to Norway and when I was in Croatia. The guy I met in Norway was at a party that some friends brought me to. He took a shining to me and we spent the rest of the party talking. Even when I left him to go speak to my friends, he would sort of linger around and make sure I was okay (was basically getting more and more drunk by the hour lol). He brought me up to the host\u2019s apartment to puke and sat with me to make sure I was alright. Some guys were being rude to me and he scolded them. He was a perfect gentleman and didn\u2019t want to make a move on me in case I was too drunk. (So I made all the moves lol).\n\nThe other guy was someone I met on tinder in Croatia. He brought me out to experience a proper Croat night out and we had so much fun. I had to leave early the next day so I gave him a quick hug and thanked him for everything. He messaged me after that and said he missed me already and was really sad that I seemed to have left in such a hurry. It was sooo sweet!\n\nI actually kept in contact with both men for a while (completely different years and trips btw!) but with travel, the chances of anything really blossoming is too small. Plus they stayed in Europe and I live in Asia. I still have them on my Facebook. One doesn\u2019t use Facebook much so not sure what he\u2019s up to, the other one is also married with 2 kids.\n\nIt\u2019s just nice to reminisce about these things and better to keep them as happy memories instead of trying to pursue them for anything more!\n\nThank you for sharing your story - it inspired me to think of my stories which made me smile!",

I think we ended up spending like 3 hours just chatting the two of us. She had a flight to Vietnam the next day and had to go to bed early. I forgot to ask for her instagram so all I have is the memory of meeting her, and that's cool. It may sound stupid but I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her for the next couple of days, like if I had a highschool crush or something. \n\nI think meetings like this are one of the things that makes solo travel so fun, maybe if I was with friends I wouldnt have met her or the exchange might have been different. In your case, at least you follow each other in instagram. Don't rule out a future encounter.",

When I was in Porto, I went on a barcrawl through my hostel and ended up hanging out with a German girl from the hostel.  She was kinda cute but mostly we had good vibes and decided to go the beach the next day. We had some beers, enjoyed the water, then went back to our hostel and hit up a nearby music festival in the park. \n\nEnd of the night rolls around, it\u2019s like 4am, we\u2019re sitting on the steps of the Clerigas tower and she asks me \u201cis there anything else you want to do?\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t kiss her. I\u2019m not a socially awkward guy, just didn\u2019t go for it. Looking back, it would\u2019ve been nice if I went for it just for the sake of the cute, intimate moment and the memory, but beyond that the kiss itself wouldn\u2019t have been meaningful without the context and build up to it.  \n\nAnyway, nice post. It was a nice trip down memory lane for me haha.",

            "comment": "Something similar happened to me - I live in Australia and did a solo trip to Nepal before the virus at the end of 2019. After spending 8 days trekking in the Himalayas, I\u2019d decided to spend two nights in Pokhara before heading to Kathmandu to catch my flight. I stayed in a mixed-gender dorm and the first night I noticed there was this young guy sleeping on the bed next to mine but we didn\u2019t talk. The next day I spent most of my solo walking around the town and by the time I went back to the hostel, I was in such a good mood to share something with someone or just talk to somebody, which happens a lot when I spend too much time solo. That\u2019s when Jonny (the same guy last night) showed up, and we started off with a \u201cHi, what\u2019s your name?\u201d And I felt we just instantly connected and we started talking with each other with such comfort that I felt I\u2019d known him for long. We had dinner together, walked around Pokhara together, rolled up a joint together, joined the other people in the hostel for drinks and bonfire together and shared music together too. It was just lovely. And when it got late, we went back to the dorm room and realized we were the only two people left\u2026 It was sad for me to have to say goodbye early next morning, it all happened too spontaneously that my brain couldn\u2019t comprehend what it meant at that point. I just knew I had to jump onto the bus to Kathmandu and fly back to Australia soon - but I was missing him the whole time afterwards, the night we spent together and the possibilities for me to see him again, also curiosity to see if he felt the same.\n\nAfter a few weeks back, I finally picked up the courage to text him again and to tell him how it meant for me - I was pretty sure I experienced something similar to love and I was regretful for not spending more time with him. And he actually expressed something similar, which made it very special. Well, there was no typical happy ending though, there was no way I could leave my life in Australia to be with him and he was about to start a new degree in Germany and there were things for him to figure out\u2026 So we reconciled our feelings but moved on. It was a bit painful for me, but I wish him the best. Still nowadays, thinking of that encounter makes me feel grateful. \n\nI think if you still feel strongly about your connection - reach out. You\u2019ve got nothing to lose. It\u2019s after all a really beautiful thing you\u2019ve shared together and he\u2019ll be happy to know too.",

Cause the him on my side hasn\u2019t reached out and I\u2019m just afraid it was one sided and then I ruin what was otherwise perfect memory.\n\nHuh.. interesting how in your story there is an Australian and German - the guy in my story is a German who works in Australia (I love Melbourne by the way!!!) and I am Asian. While Australia itself is nearer to Singapore it feels like if anything the whole dynamic seems pretty difficult.\n\nDo you still think of him?",

I felt quite similar too wondering what I should do because it was quite tricky given the distance and the fact that the trip was over, and scared too to \u201cruin\u201dsomething magical and would be disappointed if finding out what meant a lot to me actually didn\u2019t mean much to him, etc. I spoke to a good friend of mine about this struggle, and he encouraged me just to text him with nice messages, not expecting any outcomes but just to see how he was doing and things like that, and to tell him I miss him and stuff like that (the worst would be no replies but that\u2019s also the benefit of the long distance lol). I think part of me wanted this to last but actually the more I talked to him then the more I realised it wasn\u2019t possible so I found a relief, but still managed to cherish the good memories and it turned out nothing was ruined anyways - reaching out to him to let him know how I felt about our encounter didn\u2019t change the fact that I was glad to have met him and spent time with him, it helped me to better move on from this kinda wondering or mildly regretful state\u2026 \n\nI don\u2019t think of him much nowadays as it\u2019s been more than 3 years now and we don\u2019t talk anymore which is fine. I\u2019m in love now with my current boyfriend and feeling content with my life where I am - now looking back it was good to have that closure in a way haha.",

Like you said you weren't magnetically drawn to him at first as is life but It sounds like this may have been the first real chance you gave someone to get to know you quickly in a while. I think more than the fact that you two are soul mates this is a reminder of just how wonderful human connection is. I'm a straight male and had two somewhat similar experiences with great dudes at bars recently that I just found myself thinking back like DAMN! I really liked that guy. I'll admit I have even wondered if they might have been at all interested in me but I honestly don't believe they were anything more than sincere homies looking for friendship, conversation and connection in this crazy world. Also had this experience with a beautiful older girl and we ended up both admitting we had crushes on each other which blew my mind. We hooked up in the pool at her hostel and got yelled at so had to run away to the beach but after a wonderful night, she said that although it was weird she didn't want to part ways and I let her know I understood and dug her as well. We kept in touch over facebook for a little while but lived in different states and were very different people at different stages in our life. Eventually I lagged on responding to A message as I do with everyone (pretty ADHD), and she called me an asshole and I let that be that. Life is wonky, from what you wrote it sounds like you had a spark but not enough in common to necessarily be worth pursuing. Whatever happens remember that we're you're spontaneous and warm people you give people the opportunity to fall for you and vise versa. Good luck in living a rich life but sounds like you're well on your way! Epic you left him the donut &lt;3",

            "comment": "Something similar happened to me last Wednesday going into Thursday morning. I stopped at my local bar on a whim because I didn't want to go home after work. Walked in, bought a beer and looked around. I saw this guy all alone at the pool table, tall, a little awkward (maybe that's what made him approachable) I asked him if it was open table or how much it was to play...without skipping a beat he invited me to play with him. One game turned into an entire night of laughing and flirting. Come to find out this guy is about 14 years younger than me, an ex marine and was in town visiting his family for the holidays. I've hung out plenty times, been the life of the party etc etc. It's been a while, intoxicated or not where I had such powerful chemistry with someone. Just my luck he doesn't live in my town and is a juvenile to me in comparison. When the bar closed he wanted to hang out more. I told him that I didn't want to leave my car at the bar, so I offered that he follow me to a safe parking spot, gave him my number (important) to call me if he lost me while following me. I got in his truck and therebwe went out to the middle of nowhere. If he was a serial killer that would've been it for me. But I had a trusting feeling with him. He respected my boundaries and we must've kissed for what felt like hours. 4am came along and I had to go. Less than 4 hours I had to be at work. We said our byes. He mentioned again that he would be in town until next Tuesday. I ignored it and said it was nice to meet him. He leaves today and im bummed. I spent an entire 8 hours with a stranger and it felt like we were best friends. Of course he hasn't called me (I never asked for his number) I guess ill put that night in my back pocket of memories. I'll never forget that night last week. I felt like a teenager again and I'm well into my 30s.",

    "postText": "I'm literally facepalming myself as I'm writing this because this was clearly my own stupidity. But I was walking around in Addis Ababa earlier this night just minding my own business trying to look for something. A local approached me nearby and helped me find the place I was looking for. I was already on edge when that happened because not only is it my first time in the city, but  a fair amount of these encounters always lead to some sort of begging.\n\nBut I generally like to give people the benefit of the doubt because I've met plenty of locals before that had no such ill intentions and the person I was with has been helpful. The local invited me to get a cup of coffee which I didn't mind since he had some some friends and the place was fairly well-lit. \n\nWe had a nice conversation but I definitely had my red flags up in the air when a bottle of champagne (despite me making it clear that I wasn't looking to get drunk) was brought out for the table to drink and at that point I pretty much started having a bad gut feeling even more so when the ladyfriends of the local were giving the suggestion of having me invite them for a \"massage\". I gave a firm \"no\" saying that I'm not interested in such a thing. At that point I was pretty much focused on trying to wrap up whatever is happening and pay whatever highway robbery is about to be charged. Eventually the waiter came out with the \"bill\" saying that the coffee is free and that the champagne bottle was $80 USD since it was imported. Thought not a problem and I certainly am fine with paying that much since $80 means alot more to local people than it does to me and plus I do not want to get into a more sticky situation should I say no. \n\nThe waiter then came out with a credit card machine and I chose my Chase Visa card since i felt that had the best protection if something worse came up and then the waiter asked for a sign which i just gave a random scribble without looking anywhere close to my actual signature. No receipt was even given back to me. Then the local insisted on staying for more and I said that I had to go back to my hotel. I ended up walking back to my hotel and the local came up to me saying that his mom has diabetes and if it's possible to spare him some cash, I straight up said \"no\" and that I'm tight as well and then said goodbye heading back to my room. \n\nImmediately check my credit card statement and sure enough, around $750 was charged to my card which was way more than whatever was quoted. I immediately locked my card at that point.\n\nAs you can see, I made so many stupid mistakes and this is despite having encountered similar scams. But this experience certainly helped show me the good in people as well as I had really nice hotel desk workers who were nice enough to get ahold of a taxi driver to drive me to the police station and helped me through the whole ordeal and helped with the language barrier to the point that the police asked to meet with me again in the morning to get ahold of the receipt from the place because the amount of money charged on my credit card raised alot of eyebrows for them.  \n\nBut yeah, don't be stupid like me because then you potentially are out $750 if your credit card dispute fails and also having to change your flight to a later date because of the bureaucracy involved.",

If for some reason you don\u2019t want to refuse outright and feel like giving them the benefit of the doubt, you choose the location. If they insist on theirs, make up excuses about why your choice is no good, then 100% it\u2019s a scam.",

I've had plenty of people approach me to tell me the ticket office to such and such tourist trap is actually down the road at an (their friend's) office, to sign petitions (and then asked for 20\u20ac), and there's plenty more. All women, and not being asked to go anywhere with them. People who approach you out of the blue and want you to do something, anything, are pretty much always scammers. Especially if they have lots of questions for you. They target literally anyone who looks like a traveller/foreigner, however certain scams will try and target one gender more than another for sure. Still good advice to have as you travel- start saying no a heck of a lot more. Seems quite a few guys on this sub have been scammed recently.",

There's a reason guys are targeted for this 'come to a bar' scam and not women, exactly as you've outlined above, but the 'say no' thing applies to everyone- no one wants to get scammed out of hundreds or thousands of dollars. Men typically fall victim to these scams bc they love to follow a pretty lady, or think nothing bad will happen to them. It's just having awareness and the ability to say no, every time.",

Such scams are taken pretty seriously to the point that the police showed up later to my hotel to get the copy of my bank statement and even asked if I could come along with them with where it happened as they planned to confront the scammers (Unfortunately I had to fly out a few hours after so I hastily wrote my contact info). \n\nWill I be more on guard on these types of scenarios?

They take advantage of you as you\u2019re a newcomer and are criminals. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry and I hope you can get some reparation. What these people need to understand is that tourists will one day stop coming to their countries if they end up being ripped off. I met so many solo travelers who encountered similar situations and that\u2019s one of the main reasons my friends don\u2019t want to travel in anything else than developed countries. \n\nWhen even the police is corrupt you have no guarantee that your stay will be safe. \n\nI personally set my card before travelling to a limit of 200 dollars thinking that in such situation I could be ripped off at a reasonable amount even if it\u2019s a lot for me as I\u2019m a student.",

Now I pull enough money to last me a few days, and it has not failed me yet. Can a bank ATM rip you off? I guess, but not as likely.",

            "comment": "Cuba had the worst scams I\u2019ve ever encountered. The difference was that everyone seemed to be scamming so it was hard to trust anyone. They either wanted to show you something cool or it was their birthday. Ever met 50 different people with the same birthday on the same day? It made travel so miserable and the worst part is that they were so persistent and would get angry if you didn\u2019t get them a birthday drink. I cut my trip short along with other travelers who were experiencing the same. \nTaxi scams were very prevalent too. So many \u201cbroken down\u201d taxis on the side of the roads. They would then ask the tourist to pay for the tire or wait 12 hours for someone else to come pick them up. After the 3rd taxi tire, we finally said we would rather walk until a bus picks us up and like a miracle, the driver fixed the tire so he would not lose the already high priced fare.",

I found most locals that I encountered there to be helpful and honestly was able to get through Cuba because of their help. This could just be that I happen to know some amount of Spanish (thanks high school). Taxi scams are definitely something that I encountered and I find that just asking for the flat rate right before the ride starts helps clear out any possibility of scams. But I find it pretty easy to avoid the scammers in Cuba since most of them will try to converse to you in English as they're jineteros so it's really easy to avoid them.",

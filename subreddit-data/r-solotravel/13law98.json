    "postText": "25F American here traveling to Spain in the fall! \n\nThis is my first solo trip. So far I have a place to stay for the month of September in Barcelona. I plan to stay until late November but am conflicted on where to stay during the remaining 2 months. \n\nI\u2019m between:\n\n1. Extending my stay at the Barcelona apartment for September through November + weekend trips to different cities in Spain/France/Portugal throughout my stay there. \n\nor \n\n2. September in Barcelona and the remaining time in Southern Spain (looking at Valencia as an option). I could potentially stay in 2 different cities during Oct and Nov. Not more than that as I want to feel mostly settled in each place I stay.\n\nThis will be my first time in Spain. I am basically scoping out whether I want to move there (looking at grad school in Spain). I also just really want to immerse myself in the culture and have plenty of time to feel comfortable. \n\nI\u2019m aware that this is a long time for my first time in Spain. I\u2019ve spent time in Lisbon though and loved it. I\u2019m going to be staying near the beach in Barcelona, and I\u2019d like warmer weather/beaches wherever I stay. Also as much history/stuff to do as possible.\n\nI meet people pretty easily on my own, but I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019ll have an easier time making friends staying in Barcelona for the entire 3 months than I would hopping around. I\u2019m taking Spanish lessons all summer to prepare for my trip and I practice daily. \n\nAny tips or words or caution are completely welcome as well! I am aware that I\u2019ll be super uncomfortable at first and there will be challenges, but I really want to get out of my comfort zone in the most responsible way.",

Train station and buses. Affordable. Great student life, great nightlife, great food and drink culture. Not too big, not too small. Great culture in general, as well as history. Sevilla or Malaga could be alternatives as a base camp, but Granada has stolen my heart TBH\n\nAwesome place to make memories - I wish I was a twentysomething again and could do it all once more",

Valencia is just down the road from Barcelona so there\u2019ll hardly be a weather difference.  The southern coastal cities are smaller, apart from Cadiz.  So maybe re-think and look at non-coastal cities?  \n\n As someone else commented, Barcelona has quite a Catalan flavour, so if you wanted to experience more Castilliano-type, then spend time in other places too, for the immersion.

It will be easier to visit some places from Southern Spain as well as Portugal (even though you already said you were there). \n\nAlso, the beach here in Barcelona is overrated. Much better the ones in the small towns nearby.",

            "comment": "The great thing about Spain is that shorter trips should be easy to pull off. I\u2019d break it up into two base cities and then do shorter trips from there. Definitely check out multiple cities if you\u2019re not specifically applying to a school in Barcelona. Barcelona is also more expensive than a lot of other Spanish cities, so you might make your budget stretch more if you spend some time in other cities. There\u2019s so much to do here, so I think you\u2019d be limiting yourself by staying in one place. Plus, if you end up at school in Barcelona you\u2019ll have plenty of time to explore there and probably not much time to travel. I\u2019m currently in grad school in Spain so if you have questions I can answer I\u2019d be happy to help. Have fun!\n\nOh, and people are right that Andaluc\u00eda is worth exploring, but don\u2019t discount the north! Galicia is beautiful and I have heard amazing things about the other northern regions. Though if you\u2019re going to Barcelona in September, it\u2019ll be cold and rainy in much of the north by the time you\u2019re moving cities. At that time of year, Andaluc\u00eda will be more of the \u201cSpanish sun and sand\u201d that people envision. But if you don\u2019t do the northern regions on this trip, I highly recommend you check them out another time.",

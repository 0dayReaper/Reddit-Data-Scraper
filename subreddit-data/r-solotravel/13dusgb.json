    "postText": "Going to Kruger National Park (Skukuza Rest Camp) solo, for 4 days. I checked SANParks website, and these are the offered activities:\n\n05:00 - 09:00 Morning Walk\n\n05:00 - 08:00 Sunrise Drive\n\n15:30 - 18:00 Afternoon Walk\n\n16:30 - 21:30 Sunset Drive\n\n20:00 - 22:00 Night Drive\n\nIn the 4 days, I plan to take all activities. But I wonder if they all are same route for similar activity?\n\nHere might be my itinerary:\n\n**Day 1**\n\n* Arrive at Skukuza Rest Camp\n* 16:30 - 21:30 Sunset Drive\n\n**Day 2**\n\n* 05:00 - 08:00 Sunrise Drive\n* 15:30 - 18:00 Afternoon Walk\n* 20:00 - 22:00 Night Drive\n\n**Day 3**\n\n* 05:00 - 09:00 Morning Walk\n* 16:30 - 21:30 Sunset Drive\n\n**Day 4**\n\n* Check out\n\nFor example, if I go for Sunset Drive on Day 1, and another Sunset Drive on Day 3, would it all be the same route, seeing the same stuff/animal?\n\nPlease rate/review my itinerary. :) Thanks.",

If it was the same (unlikely), it's still very likely that it will be a different route. You might go one day on a drive and find the big 5 and the next day to the same and see nothing. It is a gigantic park with a lot of animals, and any given drive is going to cover a very tiny portion of the natinoal park. In the end it's a bit of luck what you will see. This is the first thing they will tell you when you start your drive with them.\n\nThe best activities for me were the sunrise and sunset drive.\n\nOn day 4 I would do the sunrise drive before leaving.\n\nAlso, the sunset drive will not be 5 hours long, possibly from 16:30 to 19:30 tops",

Sure that may be because I didn't have anything really cool happening in mine but yeah, you're more likely to find game on the morning one. I think you would spend time better on a sunset drive than the afternoon walk",

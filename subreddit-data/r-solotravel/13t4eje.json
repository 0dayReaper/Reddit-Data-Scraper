    "postText": "Hello! I am travelling to Germany next week for the first time. I am flying into Frankfurt and spending some time there before heading to Bonn for work. I purchased tickets for the Deutsche Bahn (train) with a specific departure time and stop. \n\nI was a bit confused by the ordering process, and I realized just now that I have the incorrect starting point - I put the Airport stop, when I should have put the Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof in the city centre. I have a non-refundable ticket. The same route (ICE 1022) runs from the airport into the main city and then continues its journey to Bonn.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with the German train system and know whether I can just hop on at the Main station because my ticket is for the same line and I probably *over* paid since it's a stop later? I'm quite nervous because I do not speak German and have never been to the area, so I don't want to be penalized if I attempt to get on.\n\nTIA!",

In other words, there were no gates where I had to scan my ticket to gain entry to the platform. \n\nAssuming Frankfurt is the same (and I'm 80% sure it is) you shouldn't have any problems boarding at a stop past your original departure station.",

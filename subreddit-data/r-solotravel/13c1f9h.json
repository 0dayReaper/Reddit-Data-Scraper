    "postText": "Hi there, I'm 30 (F) and asking if Paris is worth visiting for 2 days during my stay in London.  Side note: I've solo traveled to national parks and internationally to Cuba. I'll be travelling to Europe from San Francisco.I'm staying in London May 29 - June 3 and I'm debating whether visiting Paris May 31-June 2 is worth it. I've done some research and the best budget transportation option for me is Flixbus. I would take the overnight 9-hour bus ride to Paris from London to take advantage of the days. I need to be back in London by June 2 afternoon because I've booked theatre tickets for Frozen. For Paris, so far I have listed to see the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, Notre Dame, Rodin Museum, Palace of Versailles, and Arc de Triomphe. Is this a lot to do and navigate in two days? I'm not sure if 2 days is enough to enjoy the sights and food while also feeling tired from the bus travel. I don't operate well on little sleep so this is one of the reasons why I'm not keen on going however, can be persuaded if it's worth going. Side note: it's my first time in Europe, in general.\n\nI was advised to stay in England instead and explore different cities, like Oxford during those two days. I'm considering a visit to Stonehenge as well, but was told it wasn't worth visiting.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "You could stay in either city for a week and not be bored so splitting it up like this feels like you would waste the potential of both cities and would make it look like you are more interested in checking off boxes than enjoying your trip.\n\nAlso don't underestimate how exhausting travelling can be. Not long after a long flight, you'd already be going for a long bus ride.\n\nParis ain't going anywhere, so I'd suggest saving it for a different trip.",

Early on I was like OP, trying to see everything as quickly as possible. I\u2019ve since found my pace and learned it\u2019s better to soak it all in at a slower pace. It\u2019s weird, but if you go too fast you can see everything without seeing anything at all.  I come home more fulfilled with a slower pace. If that speed is OPs pace then by all means go for it.\n\nOP can do what they want but in my experience this is too fast. I\u2019ve been to London 4x and Paris twice. London and Paris are 5 day cities if you want to get a full experience. I tell people 4 days should be the minimum and you could spend well over a week in either one and not be bored.\n\nI was just in both places a few weeks ago and everything was so crowded that even with 5 days in each city I couldn\u2019t see certain attractions.",

While I usually do like a faster pace whilst traveling; I'm convinced that exploring London will be much more enjoyable than a rushed two-day trip to Paris. I will reserve that for another time. I'm thinking about visiting Oxford. I see that it's a 2-hour trip via transportation. Any tips or recommendations?",

I feel You are waisting time traveling to and from Paris when there is so much to explore around London, Oxford, Cambridge Brighton, bath, Cotswolds. Stonehenge is really nice with the audiotour (well worth it). \n\nI mean it is not only the travel bit also having to cross the border inside and outside the EU which will take a lot of time. Paris is beautiful but to really enjoy and get the vibe you will need more time. I would just relax in England and take a trip/walk in the countryside.",

Also, Palace of Versailles and Lourve individually are atleast a half a day to a full day each depending on your interests. \n\nIve also been to London a few times including a study abroad program at Oxford. Absolutely loved the architecture of Oxford and recommend it to everyone. Also explore the Roman Baths, see a play at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe Theatre, Stonhenge, explore castles and gardens, enjoy the night life\u2026 lots to do and you would be doing a disservice to yourself if you wasted at minimum 18 hrs of ur trip on bus rides (fly or take a train). \n\nAlso - Paris is highly overrated. It was my second time there and I vow not to return. Love the Lourve and that is about it. Whole Paris trip was not worth it IMO. There are more beautiful countries/cities to visit.",

So you likely won't get very much sleep at all. I'd suggest looking at the Eurostar instead, it's a great experience (leaving from St Pancras station feels so special, it's my favourite station in the world) and you can get some pretty cheap tickets.\n\nAs others have said, Versailles is a town outside of Paris, so I'd not recommend it if you've only got two days in Paris. \n\nIf you really want to go, I think you could have a lovely little trip to Paris. I know people who have done it in a day on the Eurostar from London (5.30am train there, 9pm train back for example) because both stations are right in the city centre, so you get off at Gare du Nord and it's super quick to get to any of the major tourist sites. \n\nSlightly related, there are some train strikes scheduled in the UK on 31st May and 1st June. That might mean that Paris is actually a better idea because the Eurostar isn't affected by the strikes, whereas trains to Oxford etc might all be cancelled.",

In a week, you could wrap up the highlights and then figure outlying sights like Hampstead Heath and Kew Gardens, and also the markets. Since this is your first time in Europe as well, London gives you an easy, English-friendly primer of what to (broadly) expect when it comes to navigating European cities.\n\nStonehenge can be a bit disappointing because you can only view it from a distance, and if the weather isn\u2019t that great, it turns out to be underwhelming. Oxford and Cambridge are quite pretty and easy day trips from town, as is Bath. Brighton is a fun spot too.

Much much cooler and less crowded, plus the tour guide is awesome and it\u2019s way easier to learn about the stones when it\u2019s just a small group. I did the sunset one last month and it was incredible. The people who say it isn\u2019t worth visiting only get the standard tickets that allow you to look from afar ;) \n\nAs for your Paris itinerary, Versailles is about an hour or so outside of Paris (unless there\u2019s strikes and trains are cancelled, it took me 3 hours to get there) so that would almost be a full day. The Louvre you could easily do just in the morning and see a good chunk (Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo, all the big ones) but it could be it\u2019s own full day as well. Eiffel Tower, arc, and Norte Dame you could do all in one day most likely.

As you have only 2 days, i would stay in the city centre and do something like the following:\n\nDay 1:\nArc de Triomphe\nChamps \u00c9lys\u00e9es\nPlace de la Concorde\nPalais Bourbon\nRodin\nHotel Les Invalides\nEiffel Tower &amp; Place du Trocadero\n\nDay 2:\nMus\u00e9e D'Orsay\nLouvre \nIles de La Cit\u00e9\nPantheon\nPalace Luxembourg \n\nAnd at the end of day 2 you can have some time for leisure.

If you like to party or wanna see somewhere a bit more bohemian than the rest of the country head to either Bristol or Brighton. And Stonehenge is definitely worth a visit. A tip for you though; don\u2019t pay to get in, you can\u2019t get anywhere near the stones anymore. Go down the track where all the campervans are parked and there\u2019s a public footpath on your right. Follow this and it runs right along next to the main Stonehenge site, you\u2019ll be about 4 feet further away from the stones than the people who paid a fortune to get in.",

You should also consider that the first day you will be tired from the flight and adjusting to the time zone, running on jet lag, so the first days you won't feel a 100%.\nIf you want to gey away from London, you can take a day trip Oxford of Cambridge for example.",

Don\u2019t forget that you\u2019ll be jet lagged from the very long flight from SFO, so you might not even feel up to exploring London at first, let alone going to a whole other country. There\u2019s so much to do in London \u2014 save Paris for its own trip!",

Stay in England and if you really want to get out of London go to some of the other places other folks mentioned like Oxford or Stonehenge. Plus, your bus trip of nine hours will eat into a lot of your time / mood, and that's assuming it doesn't have any delays. I could only justify a journey like that if it was getting me somewhere where I was taking a lazy / organisation day afterwards.",

I was in London last month and used the TodayTix app to get cheap theatre tickets on the day itself. Got some decent seats for around 25-30 pounds every day. The app will also tell you if certain shows use a different way of getting cheaper tickets.",

If you want to get out and see some other cities for a day trip, you have your choice. \n\nI loved just walking around Kensington or sitting in one of the Royal Parks. Plus London is spread out and standing in line will also eat up your time.\n\nStay in London.",

It's so easy to get around Paris.  Can see Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, Rodin Museum, and Arc de Triomphe in a few hours.  What I recommend instead of Rodin is d'Orsay Museum instead. \n\nIf I were you, I'd go to Paris.  If you're around Notre Dame around lunch or dinner time maybe check out this place for lunch.\n\n[https://goo.gl/maps/SaJqKbmX7uorBwdt5](https://goo.gl/maps/SaJqKbmX7uorBwdt5)\n\nOrder the cassoulet (don't know if you have dietary restrictions or not).\n\nHave a quick look here in the same area.  Might be the coziest looking place in Paris.\n\n[https://goo.gl/maps/zZ4y3XPokwA8G9vc8](https://goo.gl/maps/zZ4y3XPokwA8G9vc8)\n\nAlso consider checking out these two spots...\n\n[https://goo.gl/maps/rhg6b7SspTuWU2mY9](https://goo.gl/maps/rhg6b7SspTuWU2mY9)\n\nMight get the best view of Paris up there.  Also don't know if it's of interest to you but some of the shots from the movie Am\u00e9lie are in that neighborhood.\n\n[https://goo.gl/maps/VHsLJ7wnSUuFCcuL6](https://goo.gl/maps/VHsLJ7wnSUuFCcuL6)\n\nTo me this place is up there with Notre Dame and it's much more accessible and SO beautiful inside.  I have to run but if you have any other specific questions let me know.",

The other sites you have can be combined like the Louvre and Notre Dame (but you can only see this from the outside) so maybe combine with the Arc or the Eiffel.  Taking the metro will greatly help in getting around.",

You can do the tower and arc and cathedral in a day.  But that leaves you only a day to do the two museums.  You'll have to fly through both.",

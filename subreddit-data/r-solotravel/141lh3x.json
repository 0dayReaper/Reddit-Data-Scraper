    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019m in a bind with not much time to make a decision. I\u2019ve got vacation coming up and I can\u2019t decide what the heck to do. Greece is my top travel dream destination, has been for as long as I can remember. Days are passing by and I\u2019m making minimal moves because I can\u2019t decide what to do.\n\nI found a place to stay and flights, but I have so many questions. I will spend time doing research as well but was hoping to condense it all here to get at least some direction.\n\n1. Flight will go into Thira about 10 mins from my stay. Is it best to walk or get a ride. And how best to get a ride, are taxis/transportation fairly straightforward?\n\n2. Plan on staying for 7 nights, not an all inclusive and I\u2019m not looking for a shopping spree or high end excursions. Just food, transportation, maybe some gifts, ferry ride to other islands. How much cash should I be expecting to carry on me?\n\n3. English speaking or will there be a language barrier? Very touristy area so not very worried, but how about menus and drivers?\n\n4. I\u2019m on adderall which is illegal there, I have my med bottle with my name and providers name on it, do I need to bring a signed paper documentation from my provider and a full bottle with all 30 pills as per these website search recommendations? Vitamin prescription I think would be ok, but also taking otc iron supplements. Is that ok?\n\n5. I would only bring a small carryon suitcase with me to put in the overhead bin, not checking anything in. Would sunscreen be allowed in this?\n\nThere is no time to plan this but this doesn\u2019t seem like the type of trip to randomly go on. If I don\u2019t go this time around, at least I\u2019ll have some answers for the future when I\u2019m able to actually sit down and plan everything. Thanks in advance and I apologize for the rambling, just trying to make a quick decision!",

Unless it's a tiny bottle, you cannot (legally) carry it through security.\n\nHowever, if they find it in your bag, all they will do is confiscate it.  You won't be charged with a crime.  But it's still a pain in the butt as they search your bag, etc.\n\nSunscreen is not something that's hard to find in Greece.  It might be easier to just buy it when your there.  (And you have less of a chance of the bottle leaking all over your clothes that way.)",

Debit and credit are widely accepted in Greece. I carried no cash my entire time and was fine. The islands are somewhat expensive however, so carry a decent amount if you are paying in cash, perhaps 100/day.\n\n3. English is widely spoken.\n\n4. No comment.\n\n5. As already mentioned, you are still subject to TSA-like travel restrictions with carriers like RyanAir. Full size sunscreen bottles won't make it through security.",

            "comment": "1. Depends on how much crap you're lugging and how fit you feel. It's hilly, lots of ups and downs. Still, I'd walk.\n\n2. Can't speak to that\n\n3. Very english speaking, I had no issues. Menus are bilingual english/greek. Cab drivers and bus drivers spoke english well enough that there was never a moment where we struggled to be understood, but we kept it basic and functional rather than small talk.\n\n4. I took my adhd medication (not adderall but basically the same and also illegal) with me with no issues. I took only the amount I needed for my trip, in the original bottle that had my name on it. Did not bring any other documentation. Honestly no one even glanced at it or cared at all. Those websites made me nervous but it was honestly such a non issue. I also took OTC supplements and generic advil in unlabeled small containers, no one cared.\n\n5. If it is not checked you are limited to bottles under 100ml. Which is pretty small. BUT you can bring multiple 100ml bottles of the same thing. Note that some airports/airlines may limit how many bottles you bring, so double check that. I've had to leave stuff behind before.",

One week in Greece couldn\u2019t be any easier, it's exactly the type of trip you just click \u2018book now\u2019 and buy your flights, then book your accommodation.  Get yr passport/visas in order, go to the airport.  ffs  :)",

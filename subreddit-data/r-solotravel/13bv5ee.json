    "postText": "**Tl;dr would you do Bagan in 2 days, and would you bother if it's the only thing you wanted to do in Myanmar?**\n\nI'm a seasoned traveler, I know my ideal pace is 2-4 days/nights in a city. SEA is tougher because flying is a pain, but I hate trying to cram stuff into the dead hours between check out and check in anyway.\n\nSo Bagan is just calling to me on my route and overall I think Myanmar would be a unique experience. It's just incredibly inconvenient and out of the way.\n\nI'm sure Mandalay, Yangon, Lake Inle would be great, but realistically I'm unwilling to sacrifice the rest of my itinerary and I'm not overly interested.\n\nMaking this happen means flying into Yangon for a day to catch the Fri-Sun roundtrip that goes directly to Bagan once a week on Air KBZ\u2014Mandalay is more of a pain to get to and the 8 hour round trip drive to Bagan is also an itinerary drain. It's also the only stop I can't book direct one way to and from the others, and requires me to plan the trip around those specific dates.\n\nSo, those of you who have gone,\n\n* Is Bagan worth what will be an absolute break neck few days?\n* Am I underestimating Myanmar as a whole, and better off waiting for a trip down the road where I can do it more thoroughly?\n* Considering the likes of Penang, Chiang Mai, Bangkok, and Luang Prabang on my route, is Bagan that spectacularly different an experience?\n\n**Edit:** Wow, fantastic advice all around already, thank you guys. I can deal with fast paced when I'm confident I'm not just hopping for the sake of it. \n\nIt doesn't sound like I can do this properly with a few days, particularly given the strain on the rest of the route, and I will save it. \n\nA note on the political situation: I appreciate the heads up, and I'm aware of it. This trip is quite far out, and I planned to monitor and stay flexible to avoid unnecessary risk, and also any negative impact I could have on communities affected by it. ",

There's some great trekking and a lot to see there in its own right. If you're lucky enough to be able to make two trips, this would be a great option.",

I was there in 2015. \n\nHowever, you might want to reconsider the trip now because of the military coop. I know a lot of people have fled the country, even in Yangon there is short of electricities and water, and it is not as safe as before due to the higher unemployment rate. \n\nIt is very sad tho as what I remember about this country is its beauty and its kind people.",

            "comment": "I think you\u2019re not doing the country as a whole justice, I would strongly suggest saving Bagan for a longer trip.\n\nIt is an amazing place to visit, with so much to explore, but it\u2019s not worth going for just 2 days and skipping all the rest of the country.\n\nI spent 9 days in Myanmar and I didn\u2019t want to leave as I felt like there was so much more to see. I really wish I had stayed for 2-3 weeks and this is one of my biggest travel regrets in life, as I\u2019m now not sure when or if I\u2019ll be able to go back. \n\nI went there in 2015 so it\u2019s been a few years (and it was during what was considered a \u201csafe\u201d period to visit), but Myanmar to me had a much different vibe than other SEA countries I\u2019ve visited. It felt like a cross between India and Thailand - in both good and bad ways.\n\nEven though it was being refurbished when I visited, I still think that the Shwedagon Pagoda is one of the most beautiful pagodas I\u2019ve ever visited - it alone (+ 999 noodles) is worth at least a full day in Yangon\n\nThe only part of Myanmar I did not really enjoy was Mandalay - and it was likely just because I only had a day there and it rained the whole day",

That place was excellent. \n\nThe Shwedagon was cool too. Felt like Buddhist Disneyland, if that makes any sense. Like a lot of temples feel like history museums - that one felt alive and vibrant.",

Not only it was tiring but I also wish I had spent more time in Myanmar. I am planning another trip only to Myanmar now. \n\nIf you are comfortable with the fact there is conflict going on and it might not be perfectly safe, I suggest you spend more time in Myanmar as there are barely any tourists now. \n\nPenang, Chiang Mai, Bangkok and Luang Prabang will be the same when you get back to SEA in 5 years. Myanmar will be different place (for better or for worse - no one knows).",

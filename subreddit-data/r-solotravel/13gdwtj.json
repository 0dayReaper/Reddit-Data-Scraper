    "postText": "I am a female solo traveller in my mid 20s, and will be taking a train from Toulouse to Amsterdam soon. The layover is quite annoying however; I arrive to Gare du Lyon at 2300 and my next train leaves Nord at 0600. \n\nI can\u2019t choose a different train for multiple reasons. \n\nAs far as I\u2019ve read, it seems that sleeping at Gare du Nord is a bad idea, so I\u2019ve boiled it down to two options:\n\nOption 1:\nWalk to a 24 hr cafe and camp out there for a while before walking to Nord (I should add, I love to walk, especially at night \u2014 thoughts on this in Paris?) \nConcerns: can only really find one cafe open 24hrs, don\u2019t want to loiter, safety, no sleep\nPluses: cheap, I get to explore\n\nOption 2: \nFind a hostel somewhere between the stations \nConcerns: hostels are getting expensive (50\u20ac +) lately and I don\u2019t care to fork over the cost if I only realistically will be in the building for 4 hours, maybe less fun?\nPluses: safety, a couple hours of sleep maybe\n\nAny input on this? Particularly the safety aspect (as I will have my backpack with me) and viability of option one?\n\nUPDATE: thanks to everyone\u2019s input \u2014 sounds like safety is a fairly significant concern, and I just sucked up the cost and booked a hostel for the night.",

You could get away with one, maybe two of these things but not three.\n\nOption 1 : Walking will not be enjoyable and you will have to find bars where to be more comfortable and be able to relax. In order not to loiter, you'll have to buy drinks or snacks regularly. Assuming 5\u20ac per hour, that puts you at 35\u20ac total.\n\nOption 2 : There are hostel beds for 41\u20ac in Paris this week.\n\nI think 6\u20ac is a fair price for peace of mind, a shower and a few hours of sleep.",

Guy then followed me to the taxi rank and tried to get in the taxi with me speaking French to the driver. I made a big scene and he scared off and I got a different taxi because I don\u2019t know what was said exactly. As well as getting approached a lot for trinkets and gifts etc. It was more annoying than anything, but did put me on guard. \n\nNot trying to scare you at all, but as a solo female that did not fit in with the Parisian \u2018look\u2019 I felt I was a target. And I also had ALOT of weird experiences across Europe like this, so also not specific to Paris.\n\nThis also never happened when I was in groups with other travellers.\n\nI would either find a busy 24hr spot near nord to relax, or put down the money for a hostel even just for a shower, nap and somewhere relatively safe for your belongings.",

Glad to hear you figured out the best and safest option.  \n\nOne way to pass time is to take the metro and just ride until your time is passed.  But I don't know the current state of affairs on the Paris Metro so it may not be any safer than other options but it is probably less expensive.",

I\u2019ve always found Paris very safe at night and you could see a lot of the city at night all lit up in that time.  I\u2019m a solo lady traveler and have lived in Paris.  There isn\u2019t much to see around Nord so walk around the main sites and then grab an early train to Nord.  I\u2019ve spent years of time there with no issues.  I\u2019ve stayed up all night many times there and walked around.  Never had any issues.",

    "postText": "I'm planning a trip to both Poland and Slovenia later this summer and I wanted to get your takes on my rough-and-very-flexible itinerary. I want to get a good idea about each of the two countries instead of just visiting the capital and the second biggest city. I'm interested in nature, hikes and good food. I'm also very open to hostel/sights/activities recommendations in any of these places. Thank you!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Poland**\n\nPoznan (will fly to here, 2 nights)   \nGdansk (3 nights, with a day trip to Sopot, Gdynia and Malbork)  \nWarsaw (2 nights)  \nKrakow (4 nights, including a day trip to Auschwitz)\n\n**Austria**   \nVienna (2 nights, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in Vienna before so this is more of a transit point, happy if you have a better route to get from Krakow to Slovenia)\n\n**Slovenia**  \nMaribor (1 night, will use this as a slow day staying at a nice hotel and reading in a cafe or so)  \nLjubljana (2 nights)  \nBled and Bohinj (4-5 nights, to explore the area and the hikes around them as well, and maybe a day trip to Villach)  \nTrieste (will either take a bus to here from Ljubljana or Bled, 2 nights)  \nPiran (2 nights)   \nVenice (2 nights)",

Aswell as just having more time to really chill and see more of the area (Lake Bled activities, visit the epic viewpoints surrounding the lake, a day swimming at Lake Bohinj, Vintgar Gorge walk etc.), the reason I was most happy for having more time there is that the lake only looked like that stunning 10/10 crazy beautiful green/blue clear colour (that looks like an Instagram filter) on two of the days, and many people who were passing through only for a day or two did completely miss seeing it this way.",

Yes really just stay in Bled for the days where you want to do anything in or around Bled.  There's a bus stop with buses and vans to go to all these places all day (as well as hostels offering their own rides).  \n\nBohinj I just went one day as it is a beautiful more chill place where you can swim.  I don't know anything about staying there, just that it was beautiful and you go there to swim.\n\nAlso while at Lake Bled, just incase you don't read this elsewhere when doing research: for the best view go up Ojstrica hill (mala).  You must go here.  It's the famous classic view of the Lake.  Go to a corner of the lake (look on google maps) and then a walk up for 15-20 min.\n\nFor the second best view of the Lake, go up to the entrance of Bled Castle, and then when facing the entrance, just to the right of the entrance will be some bushes obstructing a path.  Go through the bush and up the path for a more secluded and private view.",

Postojna is the more touristy one but its fun and is very close to Predjama Castle, while Skocjan is supposed to be the more serious place.\n\nWhy not do Piran before Trieste? You can also skip Trieste completely by taking a ferry from Piran to Venice. Look it up.",

It\u2019s incredible to see the reconstructed historical architecture and the next block Soviet architecture, and then modern day buildings \nKrakow- has beautiful cafes, great night life, loads of history. There are plenty of walking tours here too. There is a nice large park just outside of the city center that is nice at sunset. Wanda Mound is a short little hike to the top of a mysterious mound and overlooks the city from a distance. But overall a really great city to walk around in. If you have extra time, a day trip to Zakopane is feasible and you can hike to Morskie Oko, walk around the lake, or do more hiking if you wish.",

Wawel Castle in Krakow I recommend visiting in the morning as they also only sell a certain amount of tickets per day and by afternoon you will have limited choice of areas to visit due to sold out tickets.\n\nIn Pozan make sure to try the St Martin's croissant. They are super proud of it, even have museum dedicated to it. \n\nIf you like hiking maybe consider a visit to Zakopane and Morskie Oko\n\nIn Bled I recommend skipping the castle. It is really expensive for a Slovenian castle and there is little to see there. If you are looking for a view point better to walk up to Ojstrica Hill. \n\nI would agree that Piran is quite small you can pretty much see it in half a day, maybe adding Koper would be a idea.",

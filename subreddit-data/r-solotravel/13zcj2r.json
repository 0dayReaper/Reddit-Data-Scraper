    "postText": "Has anyone ever done this? not looking to live or work just want to do a big holiday in these countries around Feb-March.  I wan't to take my time as much as possible and at the moment i'm thinking 10 days Taiwan, 14 days Korea and 1 whole month in Japan. I have been to Japan before but this time around I wan't to visit new places. I haven't been to Sapporo or parts of North Japan so I do have that as a must visit, I also would love to visit Mount Koya for 1 night which I missed out on last time. I also plan to drive around the Mount Fuji area for a few days. I'm also into photography so I want to explore new places and take as many photos. I plan to work and make as much money as possible this year and plan to posssible quit my job or take a long break. \n\nI'm M and 29, I think something i should mention is that I've been sober for 5 years now and won't touch alcohol again but I know drinking is huge in parts of these countries, so is there ways to find and meet new people along the way without drinking or clubbing?",

So much so that its a very real possibility you wouldn't make any. Best bet would be hosteling and trying to make friends with other travelers, but no guarantees. \n\nI would not do the trip solo if you need to meet others to enjoy it.\n\nTaiwan should be fine to meet others",

You're more likely to befriend other foreign travelers TBH. Taiwan to an extent too. There's often a language barriers that makes things difficult.",

Its a massive part of the culture to the point that more often then not the first question they ask is \"do you like to drink?\"\n\nJapan is just harder from a cultural aspect, they just arent super likely to make friends with foreigners especially if you dont speak Japanese. I dont think drinking is essential to make friends, but its a colder area people wise",

Honestly it\u2019s difficult to meet locals in all of these countries whether or not drinking is involved. Honestly I found the drinking culture in Japan less than I expected, and Taiwan much less than expected. Korea though\u2026 \n\nYour best bets for meeting ppl are whoever you meet at hostels (which were pretty quiet when I was there) but also join the country specific Reddit sub forums and FB groups. \n\nI do wish you had some more time for Taiwan though, you probably need about 2.5 weeks to get around the whole island, and it\u2019s worth it.",

            "comment": "I lived in Taiwan. 10 days is plenty. It's a very small country. You can take the high speed rail down to Kaohsiung and Tainan, and maybe explore Hualien/Taroko Gorge in the east. 2-3 days in Taipei is plenty. Actually a lot of locals in Taiwan don't drink much at all. I might be generalizing a bit, but I found that partying/clubbing isn't huge like it is in the West except maybe with young college kids and certain social circles. A \"night out\" might instead involve going to the night market, getting bubble tea &amp; snacks. People might drink beer with dinners with friends but often the focus isn't just just on the booze. So you'll be fine there!\n\nNote that around that time in Taipei it's likely to be rainy. It's a very rainy city. Personally, I prefer the rain in the winter to the blistering humid heat of the summer.\n\nKorea I believe is going to be the biggest drinking culture of the 3. And I found the hardest to meet locals.",

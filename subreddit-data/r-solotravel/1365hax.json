    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm a 21 M and I will be in Europe for a little less than 2 months this summer. \n\nI'm going to be spending the first 3 weeks in Amsterdam studying and then seeing my girlfriend in London for a week. After that I am looking to backpack Europe for most of August. I'm going to be flying home from Paris after attending a music event, so my trip will end there.\n\nCan anyone give me some reviews on my current itinerary? Right now it is pretty ambitious and I'm looking for some advice on where I should make some tradeoffs. For reference, I will be starting by flying out of London, and once I get to Spain I will most likely be meeting up with my girlfriend to end the trip through Spain, Portugal, and \\*maybe\\* south of France before heading to Paris and flying home.\n\n\\- Germany 5 days\n\n\\- Budapest (or Prague) 5 days. I'm undecided on which city, I'm open to suggestions and advice. \n\n\\- Going to be taking a trip to Austria and maybe Zagreb\n\n\\- Dolomites 4 days. I would love to spend some time here and experience these mountains in person assuming things work out.\n\n\\- Switzerland 3 days. While this is one of my top destinations I am open to going to the Dolomites and saving Switzerland for a future trip (when I'm not on a college budget).\n\n\\- Madrid 2 days. Not too committed to Madrid but flights seem cheap to get here and figured it might be fun to go out with my girlfriend for a few nights before calming down in the south of Spain.\n\n\\- Seville/South of Spain 5 days \n\n\\- Lisbon/Portugal 4 days\n\n\\- South of France 2 days\n\n\\- Paris 2 days",

If you are on a budget, I'd cut Switzerland and add those days to Madrid o or even add Barcelona. \nMadrid is so beautiful, you won't regret it, although it's important to note that Madrid and the south of Spain un August can get VERY hot so definitely recommend adding any city with beaches (almost any beach city in the south of Spain, most of them are great but I've only been to M\u00e1laga so maybe someone else can recommend here). \nNever been to Budapest or Prague but a few years ago, I did some research to visit, and most suggestions where for 2 or 3 days, so 5 could be a lot?\nRe: Paris, is your first time there? If it is, I'd suggest staying at least 4 days.\nAs for Germany, which city/cities would you visit?",

The cities are not far aeay, you can go by train.\nSkip Zagreb, go to Slovenia/Ljubljana instead.\n\nI would not do Switzerland in 2 days.\n\nSpain is very hot in August, so maybe you better stay 2 more days in South France/travel along the French Riviera than having 2 more days in the hot Spain.",

    "postText": "The popular places like Thailand/Vietnam etc\n\nI've heard/read from quite a few places and also from Instagram, that it's full of people in teens and 20's.\n\nI've never been a heavy party animal, but certainly less now than before at 33. I don't do drugs but I enjoy a few beers at a bar without having an interest in drinking heavily until 3/4am or later, fundamentally as I find myself without the energy for that these days.\n\nWhen I look at the hostels on hostelworld, they do appear to all look like serious party hostels for people in their 20's. But I also want to meet people along the way.\n\nMy nightmare scenario would be arriving to a hostel where there's a large group of 18-23 year old topless westerners topless lounging by a pool, all drinking and with loud music blaring. Perhaps they're on their first trip, experimenting with drugs and ordering countless shots at the bar. I would hate to be in that environment (just my personal preference). But equally I'm not after the entire opposite. It's just about finding a bit more of a balance. Latin America was really easy for that because it was very normal to find yourself in a social hostel with people in their 30's, but without it being a party hostel. But as I said, my impression is that it's different in SE Asia. And a number of hostels seem to have '22 bed dorms', which is in my experience, a bad sign and usually indicates a large party crowd.\n\nHow have people found SE Asia in their 30's? Any reccomendations for hostels in the major cities in Thailand and Vietnam?",

Look for key words like \"relaxed\", \"quiet\", \"chill\", etc. I've had the best luck at places with smaller dorms (8 people max) and lots of private rooms available.    \n\nAlso small guesthouses can have a hostel vibe but with older folks. I was at an inexpensive \"boutique hotel\" in Cambodia and met loads of other travellers in their 30s; stayed at a guesthouse in Koh Sok national park last year and 30s seemed to be average age. They both were inexpensive hotels with single bed private rooms available and breakfast included (great way to meet people).",

Indeed, one of the wildest party animals I met was someone in her 30s. I also once had a Couchsurfing host who was in her late 30s and she was the one who went and got so drunk she couldn't stand.\n\nJust pick your crowd. There are plenty of chill backpackers who are not that big on drinking and partying. I'll tell you what, in Bangkok, stay at Lubd, that's a fine hostel that's usually got civilized backpackers. In Vietnam, can't remember the hostel, but I recall we walked around until we found a place that had a room... turned out great. It probably won't be an issue.",

I was part of a larger group of people in Bangkok and we ranged from 18-41 and everyone partied to their own comfort level and we split up towards the end of the night based on what we wanted to do. Not a single person got judged for their age. Even the 41 year old was chill and mature but also cool af and we loved him. We were just a bunch of random solo travellers or people in small groups who came together and made one big group and it was freaking awesome. Some wanted to party on Khao san road , some people wanted to stay behind at the hostel to have chill beers , some went to fancy rooftop bars to have casual drinks and then we would all meet up in the morning for breakfast and sightseeing. No one was forced to party past their limit and everyone had good company and good friends . Not every single person in their 20\u2019s is a party animal. You will meet people that you vibe with and are on the same level with regardless of their age. \n\nI will tell you though that the people I met there in that group, I have met up with multiple times in my trip through Thailand and have remained my close friends till this day with solid plans to reunite again. I am so thankful that when I landed in Bangkok I just put my best self forward with the intention of making solid friends . Set the intention you will have a good time and meet the people that you need to meet and you will find what you\u2019re looking for in sea.",

Other times, we chatted with travelers who we met while taking vans or other transportation popular with backpackers from city to city. We talked about our future legs of our trips and shared our favorite spots to start, we often ended up meeting back up with each other later during the trip. Fucking phenomenal!  \n\nNote that most guest houses in Thailand don't have a shared kitchen but we really enjoyed being able to cook a few meals at the ones that did. \n\nWhen I was there, the police were really strict about pot and even though I smoked a few I was careful to be away from public spaces. that meant that our guesthouses were pretty chill and we mostly hung out in hammocks and drank beer or Sang Som and Coke.",

It may seem hard to differentiate on first glance, but looking at multiple reviews not only from the booking sites, but from bloggers and Reddit can help too. \n\nFor instance, one of the better hostels in Chiang Mai (Stamps) may seem like a party hostel on paper, but it's really more of a social hostel where they take people out partying at night if you want to join. Otherwise they close the common areas down at midnight and things are quiet from there on. They run events every night which are very popular and it's very easy to meet people.\n\nYour nightmare scenario is quite... something. Trust me, you'll have hostels with pools which will have people gather around in bathing suits (it is a pool, what did you expect?). But if you're implying there will be a bunch of topless women hanging out... yeah no. No one will be doing drugs out in the open, given drugs are very illegal in most of Southeast Asia anyways and reputable hostels enforces rules against drug use. You'll get some people who can't handle their liquor, but the whole drunken rowdiness, puking and pissing everywhere and knocking on people's doors are way overblown, just speaking as someone who has done his share of party hostels as an older guy. \n\nAnd the last thing, nobody really gives a crap about your age unless you make it a big deal or act like you're better than them because you're older. Just be social and cool and no one cares.\n\nHow it usually goes: \"How old are you? \n\n\"32.\"\n\n\"Awesome!\" \n\nIf you happen to look younger, you'll be complimented too as a bonus. But you're going to meet people of all ages given how popular Southeast Asia for tourism and backpackers.",

My advice to you is that you can seek out places in Thailand/SEA that fit your vibe. There is definitely a party/drinking scene that skews young, but if you don\u2019t actively go to those places, then you won\u2019t really have this issue.",

It's just nice to have a travel companion for a bit. Especially if you are an extrovert. I wish I had.\n\nAdding on to say the advice hear about reading reviews on hostels is key. You can get the vibe from the reviews really well and it helps. Solo traveling is great because it does force you to look inward and be alone. You'll meet some great people. The amount of company just ebbs and flows. Sometimes you have tons of friends and sometimes it's just you.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, you\u2019ll probably find some absolutely awful hostels (for me it was Singapore and Salzburg), and some that part of you won\u2019t want to leave (Bangkok without a doubt for me, and I really enjoyed my hostel in Florence too). \n\nMy main advice on the social aspect is to do your homework and try to get as much of a vibe check as possible. At 29 I can appreciate a good few drinks and the odd night out but also enjoy my sleep. I used Booking.com rather than hostelworld (don\u2019t know if it makes much of a difference) and scouted reviews thoroughly before committing to a hostel. I\u2019m a fairly light sleeper but the only time that I struggled because of other guests being loud in the room was my last night in Paris when a couple of guys were pre drinking in the room before they went out (a few other places because of snorers but that\u2019s a whole other thing).\n\nLastly there were places I went to where my itinerary was just crammed with full day activities and therefore I wasn\u2019t overly interested in meeting fellow travellers at the hostel, so I looked for a decent cheap hotel (I think I found one in the centre of Kota Kinabalu, East Malaysia that was about \u20ac8/per night more expensive than the hostel I was originally considering, and the standards were still pretty good) so consider that as an alternative in those situations",

One of the coolest guys I met in Laos was 34 and nobody gave a shit that he was a bit older (he\u2019s still young!).\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not the case that all hostels in SEA are party hostels. Avoid mad monkey and those types of places for the most part but there are loads of hostels that will advertise themselves as having more of a relaxed atmosphere but still encourage socialising. \n\nI personally prefer social hostels that aren\u2019t obnoxiously loud but would rather a party hostel over a few of the completely dead ones I stayed in that had no atmosphere at all. Reviews are a good way to get an idea of what it\u2019s going to be like but it often depends on luck as one week there might be a great group of people and the next week there might be barely anyone at all.\n\nDepending on the locations you\u2019re planning on visiting, I can send some recommendations for specific hostels.

You can find literally tons of them on Booking.com, and several of them offer a non-party but social environment with other guests who (usually backpackers in their 30s and 40s, and some families). You get your own room and an ensuite bathroom, which is something I deeply appreciate when I retire at the end of the day. \n\nMy advice would be to choose a homestay that\u2019s located in the heart of the city (eg District 1/3 for HCMC, Old Quarter for Hanoi), tucked into an alley away from the blaring clubs but still walking distance to get a drink. For HCMC, I stayed in Ekomo Home, and for Hanoi I stayed in Hanoi Family Homestay. The hosts are warm and hospitable, and will take care of you. I\u2019ve also had the pleasure of befriending people from all over the world through these homestays (eg during homecooked dinners), and through tours. Most of them are &gt;30 years old and best of all, there won't be a single topless 23 year old in sight. Hope this helps a bit!",

Hostels with individual rooms might cost a little more but they often have couples or older travelers who don\u2019t want to be staying in a dorm with 10 other people.",

Luxury hotels can be as cheap as $25 a night. \n\nIn places like Vietnam and Cambodia they\u2019re quite strict about morality so I didn\u2019t see much topless debauchery. Some brits were jailed for something along those lines when I was there though. \n\nThere\u2019s lot to do without alcohol. \n\nThere\u2019s certainly 30 year olds travelling solo throughout.",

I just realized I didn\u2019t want to go down the rabbit hole that I saw around me. Still had life changing times. I also met many many travelers 30+, in fact honestly a lot of 50+ as well. Like others have said, life doesn\u2019t stop when you hit 30 and people go long term traveling (or short term) for all sorts of reasons and in all sorts of situations. Sure, you might have a weirder times at certain events or certain bars where you feel out of place, but, the same could be said for your hometown/city. Where I live, as I\u2019m exiting my 20s, I\u2019m not really gonna want to be hitting up college bars to hang. Also some of the coolest people I met and hung out with for a while were way older than me. If you can hang you can hang. Not all yougnins are crazy or averse to making friends with older people either. Go and have a fun time :)",

Granted, I have not done hostels at all mostly, been more of an AirBnb type, but even in yours 30s and \"going out and just having a few beers\" (Hey, I'm right there with you, I'm fine with just a few beers and maybe a cocktail), you'll find people in their later 20s or even in their 30s still there and perfectly fine striking up a conversation or having a good time, even if not a hardcore nightlife, SE Asia has plenty of culture to offer on top of it all.\n\n  \nEspecially Saigon, Vietnam, plenty of lower key Jazz clubs and cocktail lounges with a matching crowd for that sort of scene.\n\nI personally wouldn't let the rowdy 20s crowd to too much of a hinderance.",

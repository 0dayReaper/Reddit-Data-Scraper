    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI'm from the US, born and raised. However I have South Asian heritage. I am brown and all my life I have wanted to go across Europe. Stay in hostels, rail from country to country. I have met awesome people but, the negative experiences outnumber the good.\n\nIt has gotten to the point where I do not want to travel anymore. I have never seen such blatant open racism in my life, it's insane. I have had people try to start fights with me out of pubs because I \"was muslim\". I'm not musllim btw. I attended a music festival in Belgium and was profiled by security and threatened by people in line waiting for the performance to start. The constant stares and ugly looks I get just make me depressed.\n\nI'm not angry, I'm just heartbroken. I try to see the best in people but this was just awful. I think your countries are beautiful and there is a lot to see but, I don't think I want to go back. My last straw was when I was going to a club with a bunch of guys I met at my hostel but, I wasn't let in. One of the bouncers called me a terrorist. I couldn't believe this. I even showed him my passport but I still was not allowed entry while all my friends were. Big cities usually aren't as bad but I have learned that the farther I venture out, the more hostile people become.\n\nI'm sorry if this comes off at shitty. I know all Europeans aren't racist but, I don't see myself going back anytime soon. My time in Europe has been more heartbreaking than anything.",

I lived there for 4 years as a student, and just want to give a bit of context to your experience there.  \n\nThere are two main groups of foreign prostitutes in Bergen: Romanians and Nigerians. Both of these groups hang around the area you sat on in the evening and night, from the shopping centers in the main shopping street until about the Starbucks down at the Bryggen harbor area. Because of the climate, most of them also dress moderately or in normal Saturday night garments. The only way to tell that they are prostitutes really are by location, behavior, and unfortunately because of the nature of their nationalities, skin and hair color. There are also a lot of drunk idiots around that area in general, especially in summer. You might have been really unlucky with time and place.  \n\nThe above doesn't excuse what happened, just giving a bit of context to make sense of it. One should be able to sit in the middle of town without being accused of being a prostitute no matter who you are or how you look. I want to express that in general though, Bergen is a relatively progressive and multicultural city with smooth and natural interaction between people of different cultures, ethnicities, nationalities etc.",

Explanation I was given is that the people taking the pics were from the countryside and those were the first Caucasians they'd ever seen, which is odd but makes some sense I guess. Happened in rural Indonesia as well.  \n\n&gt; then i would be refused entry somewhere or be reluctantly seated in a restaurant and then no server would ever come. \n\nTbf I experienced the same some places, and I'm Asian and could pass for local.

I even had a dentist in Japan turn me away because I wasn't Japanese. My partner and I got turned away from hotels because we were different races from each other. I was amazed in Japan the reaction I got from Africans when they learned I was dating a black guy. More than one of them told me that I should be dating someone of my own color.

The Asian beauty standard is to be fair skinned as those who are darker \u201cwork in the fields\u201d - just look at all the skin whitening procedures in the major Asian cities. This superiority is displayed toward even Asians with darker skin colors: Indonesians, Filipinos, Cambodians, etc.\n\nJust wanted to put that out there for those who think being white is remotely similar to those of darker skin colors.

Overall, it was a big shock to me because I've travelled extensively in US cities and sometimes been the darkest face in the room, but never felt that way. There's a stereotype that Europe is more \"liberal\" than the USA re: race but... well, not that simple. Particularly, it felt like anti-immigrant/-Muslim sentiment is more of a rural thing in the USA, but relatively more common in urban centers in Europe. (Obviously a generalization, but.)\n\nOf course there are a ton of destinations other than Europe. And Europe is a huge area so here's hoping if and when you go back you find friendlier bits.",

While we were dancing in the club, this girl (white) walks up to me yelling why did I touch her butt. I was very confused and clueless. I didn't know what was happening and I was trying to tell her I don't know what she was talking about. Of course, she didn't buy it until her friend told her that it wasn't me. You think it ended there? Nope. There was this Spanish guy who punched me in the face. This made me really angry because I did nothing wrong. I'm a pretty fit guy and my adrenaline wanted to beat that mfer's ass down but a lot of people calmed me down.\n\nDoes anybody want to guess who spanked her butt? It was this white guy who was dancing next to me. How do I know? He later apologized to me that he did it and didn't wanted to own up to it because he was scared. My point is that, Europe is very racist towards non-white people when compared to America but I wouldn't let it affect traveling. I'm currently in Florence and people are really friendly but I still get a lot of stares and hey, I just ignore them. Next time, I am planning to carry bear or pepper spray to keep these racist people away.\n\nEdit: /s about pepper spray ;)",

You bring up a lot of truthful yet unfortunate crap that most people don't care to acknowledge.\n\nNo, not everyone is treated the same and greeted with welcoming arms when encountering other cultures.  When travelling overseas as a person or color, expect to get your your first  taste of the following 5 things *at some point* :   (1.)Colorism  (2.)Hostile cultural stereotypes  (3.) Being treated as subhuman from locals who are still stuck in backwards colonial mentalities  (4.) Being treated like an outsider just for having a skin complexion/ racial features that arent the norm in a certain country. (5 ) Being  labeled as a totally different culture/ethnicity. Those are the harsh realities that I will not sugarcoat and have experienced a few times myself when overseas.\n\nWhen I lived in Singapore, one my collegues from Bangladesh told me about his colorism experiences there.  Whereas, I experienced a lot of rude \"What the hell are you?\" types of stares among older locals while in places like Cambodia. Over there, they are used to constantly seeing people like White Westerners  and Chinese tourists.  But someone who looks like me? Er\u2014 it was \"alien-stare\" galore.  And yes, it's annoying and uncomfortable\u2014even more so since I am  a rather reserved person. Unfortunately, you just have to come to terms that not *every* local is as open minded or well versed on other people, cultures, or events beyond  their country.",

I'm American myself and was very surprised and disillusioned at how much more blatantly racist, ignorant, willfully disinterested and xenophobic many parts of the rest of the world are after growing up hearing about how bad racism is in America. As I was taught, racism is supposed to be a uniquely severe problem in the US(and there's plenty to be angry about, we suffer from all the vices I mentioned above), but I've seen it everywhere, and in a lot of \"modern\" countries where any dialogue regarding racism is not even an option. Anyway, sorry that happened, and keep bouncing around. There are two hundred countries, and you'll find some good spots.",

They'd say whatever, we all look the same.\n\nI have a good friend that's Irish and people always assume she's British. Let me tell you, if you ever want to start some serious shit... call an Irishman British. \n\nThe moral of the story is you can't fix stupid, especially in people who have no desire to learn. I still travel solo, but I will admit I now prefer certain countries over others. In Europe, my favorite place hands down is Ireland. Fairly tolerant, gregarious people who are quick with a welcoming pint. As a Canadian, I usually feel right at home there.",

            "comment": "Bangladeshi in late 20s here who moved to the US for college and identified as a Muslim till I was 19/20. Basically, I look as South Asian as it gets and sound as American as American pie, so I probably fit the same demographic as you. \n\nI also spent over a year in Europe- 6 months studying abroad in a spot, and then 7/8 months backpacking very fast through almost all of Europe- and went out most of those nights. I am hoping this comment adds some value for you.\n\nThe incidents you described sound straight up terrible and I am really sorry they happened to you. I have had some isolated incidents from time to time (been attacked by Nazis twice in pubs in Latvia, and had people passive-aggressively say racist shit in front of me/my friends among other stuff). The major difference in our experiences would be that, for me, it never came from figures of authority (bouncers/security) and almost every time it happened, either my friends or even strangers around me lost their shit and reacted strongly against such racism.\n\nThe one time I had extra screening at a Finnish airport because of a compression sleeve I was wearing on my knee, the guards looked almost anxious and apologetic for possibly coming off as racist. I think the second difference, about how people around me reacted to racism, is probably key here (**people wondering what they can do to it in response to stuff like this, take notes**). When racist people at a pub in Eastern Europe were mean to me once, a stranger in his 50s who saw this took me outside for a drink and talked to me for 20 minutes to make sure everything was okay. In Poland, when some drunk racist old dude got mad because I (he called me black for some reason) was on a date with a Polish woman, my date got so furious that he legitimately got scared (I don't condone violence in response, but it was still good to know someone had my back). Also, in Poland where I spent 40 days, I have seen a lot people react negatively towards bigotry in general, big or small, in the cities. On a pub crawl in Krakow, a homophobic bouncer kicked two guys in our group out of a pub for jokingly kissing. The Kiwi crawl leader put his body on the line against the bouncer standing up for these two kids. Because of these incidents, I feel like the people I always went to clubs with would refuse to leave me alone outside the club if I wasn't allowed in because of my race/ethnicity. Tbh, the guys from your hostel who did so sound either like they are immature or pieces of shit for leaving someone in a position like that. From what I have seen from staying at over a 100 hostels, I would say they are not representative of people you meet at hostels. Probably partially because of these differences how we experienced racism, despite facing racist incidents, I still think of my time in Europe as the best time in my life, and actually want to move there in the near future.\n\nNow, I understand how a few experiences can make you weary of a group for a long long time. I went to podunk Oklahoma for college, traveled a bit around the South and essentially faced everything you described on a confrontational level and also in more subtle levels.  I know that once you go through stuff like that coming from a certain group, you can feel anxious around someone from the same demographic. If I still meet a Southern, rural person who is not being nice to me, I can't help but wonder if it's also because they are racist. And that's sad because some of the nicest people I met were also rural kids from the South, but the strong negative memories just stick out more for some reason. So I don't know if my different experiences will make you feel any less anxious about yours. But I hope my experiences and the comments from other people who have also had positive experiences do make you reconsider giving Europe another shot at some point.",

This doesn't make us better: the reason we've had to talk about this is because we forcefully brought in millions of Black slaves and then instigated a racist legal and structural system to keep them oppressed.  It then took hundreds of years to get blacks and whites full legal equality without segregation, and even now, we're still dealing with those systems that were built on racism.  \n\nSo we've had to talk about this because our history is pretty terrible, but at least we've been talking about it.  Immigration of non-white people is still a relatively new thing for us, too (we kinda kept non-whites away as much as possible until 1965), so we're still figuring out how we talk about Asians and other non-Black POC, but at least we have a history of not ignoring race.\n\nEurope has also been pretty terrible to non-Europeans, but most of the colonization and fights for equality happened away from Europe, which means that the people within Europe have stayed relatively homogenous until lately. So people in say, South Africa, have had to deal with racism and colonialism, in the way that people in the Netherlands and England have not, though they were the ones who did the colonizing.  But now that immigration is starting to happen a lot more, they're having to figure out how to talk about race...and mostly, they're just not talking about it and ignoring it.  \n\nAs someone who is non-white, I'd much rather live in the US than Europe (though I would certainly like a better healthcare system and such).  The US has a LOOONG ways to go, but we at least got started on this a long time ago and have made some progress.  Though also, there are definitely places even within the US where I would want to live more than others, just like there are places within Europe that are better than others.",

Never mind that my family has been in the US for over 150 years. That said, people *can* accept I'm an American, even if they assume I'm a recent immigrant. When I've traveled elsewhere, people have sometimes had a hard time figuring out that I'm American at all.  \n\nI've definitely heard tons of racist comments in the US, but in the US, as much as many people rail against \"PC\" culture, it's generally accepted that you won't, say, make slanty eyes at me or make overtly racist remarks. Has it happened to me in the US? Sure. But nothing like the casual, non-PC racism I've experienced in other countries, particularly Europe (and that I've heard of black people experiencing in Asia).  In the US, you have to at least try to hide your racism, even if you're still racist. In the US, we at least play lip service to loving diversity and being a \"melting pot\" and saying \"give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.\" \n\nThe structural stuff in the US is bad, and worse than in many countries, because again, the country was *built* on the oppression of black people and the elimination of indigenous people and the fear of anyone else, in a way that much of Europe was not.  But we're at least talking about this. Well, more like arguing and yelling and throwing tantrums at each other, but it's a sign of progress even if it often feels like the reverse.

It absolutely enrages me when I think about the story of my friend\u2019s experience at the Copenhagen airport on Christmas Eve 2 years ago. He is Norwegian of middle eastern descent and he was prohibited from boarding his flight simply because of his skin color and ethnicity. The airline staff would not let him board and not only did he \u201cmiss\u201d his flight, he had to pay extra money for another flight the next day. My blood boils just thinking about the open discrimination by the airline staff AND security guard who denied him boarding for a flight that (1) he paid for and (2) arrived in time to catch. \n\nIf this happened in the US, it would be front page of the NYTimes. My friend has experienced similar discrimination his entire life and handled the situation calmly but I personally would have LOST MY SH*T. \n\nI feel lucky to live in an (relatively speaking) egalitarian society here in the states. It could be so much worse in other first-world countries.",

My mother is white, redhead, blue eyes kind of white. We're Brazilian and the only thing foreign left in her after 20 years is a little bit of accent. Many women here come from Russia and Ukraine, they are WHITE, WHITE AS WHITE CAN BE AND ANY AVERAGE MIDDLE-AGED ITALIAN WOMAN HATES THEM BECAUSE THEY AREN'T ITALIAN. Any time my mother gets into a fight with some Italian lady she gets yelled to go back to Ukraine instead of stealing Italian husbands.\n\nEvery.\n\nSingle.\n\nTime.\n\nAnd she's white. I can't image how hellish life in this country is for a PoC.\n\nJust a couple weeks ago the news reported that a Southern Italian girl was denied rent by a Norther Italian woman who said she doesn't rent to southern Italian people because she's - her exact words - \"100% racist and not ashamed of it\". And the girl was WHITE. \n\nI'm not saying skin color doesn't matter, of course, I'm saying that Europeans have just found a way to create some form of futuristic racism in which pretty much 0.8% of the population is human and the rest isn't - even if of course ANY colored person has it worse",

I was also very disturbed by the stares and attitude I got while visiting Budapest. I'm half Surinamese, half Dutch, and I definitely look ethnic. \n\nI hope that you haven't visited the Netherlands yet and if you did, that your experience was a good one. If you haven't been yet, and at some point you do feel like travelling again, I would like to recommend Rotterdam or Amsterdam. Both very interesting cities with diverse city centers, though Amsterdammers and Rotterdammers don't like each other much to put it mildly.\n\nRotterdam is the most ethnically diverse I believe, and they have a very big no-nonsense attitude. Very unlikely to not be let into a club based on skin color, though outfit does matter to some.\nA few recommendations:\n\nBiergarten/BAR: \nBiergarten is an outside bar type thing with bbq food during the day and lights and drinks at night, BAR's back entrance is on the same side. (Annabel is also there if you want to take a look). If you get into BAR before 23:00 it's free on most days (open thur-sat), you can get a stamp to move in and out freely. Music quality differs a bit, but most times it's a good place to have fun, some semi-regular events like Heartbreak are quite popular.\n\nWitte de Withstraat: \nThis is just a street full of bars and places to eat. Always a good mix of tourists and residents. De Witte Aap is the most famous, but it's also a good idea to check out Supermercado and Wunderbar, or grab a bite at Warung Mini.\n\nMarkthal/Grote Markt: \nAt station Blaak there is a market on tuesdays and saturdays, from 08:00-16:30 I believe. Combine that with a visit to the Markthal and your inner foodie (if you have one) will be very pleased.\n\nI hope you can find your passion for travelling again, and that when you do you'll let nothing and no one stop you from exploring the world.\n\nEdit: mobile user, sorry for bad format",

Although in General you will get attention for not being white (I am half Latino and there are enough people that let me remember this, but not in a positive way, and I am German in my passport, and in my heart, but some don\u2018t want me to be German it seems, because I don\u2018t know, Im not white enough?)\n\nBut to be fair, you really have to visit the citys, it\u2018s more than all the countryside which is bad, country people are stubborn, weird, and racist. Citypeople in General (obviously there are outliners) are really tolerant and act like I am one of them aka like you should be able (but aren\u2018t) to expect from everyone. \n\nWe can\u2018t change our skin color, we can\u2018t change our parents, and maybe we don\u2018t even want to, because I love my both parents equally, even the non-German one. I try to make all people feel comfortable around me as long as they aren\u2018t assholes to me, regardless of any colorshade in their skin.\n\n Black people, brown people, white people, are all people. Some are assholes some are nice. And that trait is not sorted by color, so why should I sort people by color? That\u2018s what all of them should think of. \n\nOh and racial profiling, well we had terrorattacks in europe and those that got the most media attention were done by ISIS terrorists which used the refugee crisis to get terrorists into European Countrys. I am not sure if any terror attacks were done by non-muslims, though we know that our media is far from perfect. This leads to people being more carefull towards people they think of as maybe members of a terrorist group. Also islam is very rare in Europe, or at least it was. Most people are christian and have no clue about islam. It is sufficient to tell them that it is written in the quran to kill infidels and then a few terrorattacks and a few maybe religiously motivated (maybe not) murders by muslims and everyone begins to fear muslims. Especially as our politicians are really incompetent when it comes to fighting that fear. Some even want to use that fear and so they help the media in scaring us. No wonder they treat you like that if you look remotely like a middle eastern person. Although still not excusable to not let you in a club. No terror attacks I know of were commited in a club that\u2018s just very stupid. Don\u2018t take it personal please those were the assholes. Remember the nice people you met, beautiful buildings and landscapes you have seen, and the good times you had, try to not think too much about the bad times you had.",

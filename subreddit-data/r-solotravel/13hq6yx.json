I am trying to figure out if it\u2019s feasible for me to go (have never been to Israel so would love to), but my partner doesn\u2019t want to/isn\u2019t able to come, so I\u2019m really debating doing it solo for the 5 night trip and would love opinions for those that have done this area solo (specifically females) or females that live there that can give any recommendations on solo female travel there or things to consider. \n\nAlternatively, I should be able to work remotely for a few days afterwards to extend the trip to be more manageable, so would also consider venturing further away from Tel Aviv to recommended areas for solo female travel (both in terms of ease of travel as well as safety) to take in more sights/culture, etc.",

I just want to meet new people, fellow travellers like me, or the local Spaniards who could recommend me things to do. However, I do not know how will I achieve that. I have heard that one of the ways to get going and making friends and breaking that barrier is through going on pub crawls. Not really sure how true is that.  \nCan somebody help me prepare an itinerary for my trip?\nIt\u2019d be wonderful if somebody would want to hop in on my experience if you\u2019ll be travelling around the same time.

You have to present yourself for the Tokyo flight on time, regardless of what happens on your flight from Canada to SF.\n\nIf the press release I googled is still accurate, your flight to Tokyo leaves SF at 5pm, so you'd need to be standing in the terminal by 3:30 at the absolute latest as you won't have PreCheck for security.  \n\nHonestly I'd plan on getting into SF the night before if you are on separate tickets.   If you are coming from Vancouver, then maybe a 6am flight would work.  From Toronto, you would leave yourself zero margin for error leaving on the same day, and zipair is under no obligation to put you on the flight the next day if you miss it because of your first flight.\n\nGoing back to Canada, you arrive at 3pm, so a flight at 7pm to Western Canada or a red-eye to Eastern Canada should be fine.  Not as big of a deal if you miss that connection.",

I live in the DMV (DC, Maryland, Virginia) area. 24 years old and recently single from a 3-year-long toxic relationship but I also just graduated with my Masters and was allowed 3 months off work to travel and decompress. I am going to England here shortly and have never traveled solo. I am so nervous, but more so excited to start this new chapter. Any tips on where to stay in London or around England? I am there for 7 days and want to meet people and see all the things. Any suggestions??? \n\nThanks!",

(For ex., flights 2x or more the cost of even going cross country, that are 2x or more the normal length, happens both on Kayak and Google. Skyscanner doesn\u2019t even function)\n\nIf there is no such site, any recs on tactics given this?\n\nEDIT: Also\u2026 Does a non-minty travel size toothpaste exist?",

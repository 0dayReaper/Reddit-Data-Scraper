    "postText": "As a first time traveller 10+ years ago I had this feeling that I was holier than thou because I stayed in hostels in places my friends had never been to and got this 'genuine' experience.\n\nI didn't like resorts because they were not travel, I looked up to hitchhikers and long term travellers who had really roughed it and sought it deeper and more secluded locations. For some people though, that's the extend of the stuff they want to do and the walking (travelling) around they want to do. It's not for me but it can be for them.\n\nAt the end of the day most travel is pretty much summarised as walking around and looking at stuff. When my friend first said this to me I stopped for a moment and thought about it. It sunk in and I accepted it. It was a wonderful revelation to see that box around my time without being pressured by it. Everyone likes to look at different stuff, maybe museums, BJJ tournaments, tall thing, underwater things, food and who knows what else. It gave me some real comfort to simplify my description of travelling to people as this. At the moment I'm focusing on the walking (hiking) and other times I focus on the stuff.\n\nIt's the response I now use as well when at a hostel and someone asks what I'm doing tomorrow or today and it's always met with a moment of pause and then a desire for inclusion. \n\nI have now done some amazing walking and seen some of the best stuff in the world but it's nice to enjoy doing the baby version of that too and walk around less impressive places and look at that stuff. I might not write about the 967th tallest waterfall in the world but I still enjoyed it.\n\nTLDR Gatekeeping travel is dumb, all we're doing is walking around and looking at stuff.",

But at home the greek food is pretty damn good. So it\u2019s not a huge on my to-do list of eating a bunch of Greek food lol",

You may have good Greek food, but going to the source is an opportunity to eat it fresh and to local styles that your shop back home probably doesn't offer on the menu.

Another fun aspect of travel is learning about the regional variety of food in a country that is easier to understand when you travel through that region and see the difference in crops and animals being grown on the farms.",

I'm 70 and I've been traveling alone most of my life. Depending on my mood I may be doing more traditional sightseeing although that's rare for me, but museums, the expected things. But more than off, I just wander, I love to eat, I love visual delight, art and architecture and. gardens.\n\n But it comes a time that even that gets stale, I go sit in a cafe just watch people ,chat up people as I will If I need a little company, etc. The worst for me would be to have to conform to a schedule, to a tour to an expected list of things to check off. I find it very interesting the different styles of traveling.\n\n Some people on here have a long list all laid out, city after city, buzzing to this buzzing to that, check that off the list, move on have 12 more days etc. That is antithetical to my style. Although I may have a rough itinerary of where I'm going and how I'm getting there, I may just fly to Frankfurt for example, rent a car and had northeast. The only certainty is a return ticket probably a month later. I may have intended destinations or a relative to visit here or there maybe but only maybe.. for me the excitement is what is often ahead with minimum structure. Some people thrive on this as I do some people abhor it and would freak out not knowing what's coming the following day or that afternoon. I guess we're all different",

I don\u2019t stay in hostels anymore and instead much prefer to rent out a room in a shared apartment for a week or two. A more chill version of walking around and looking at stuff :)",

Until a few years ago I would have no plans, aside from my lodgings and just see what I stumbled upon.  \n\nI work at a museum and spend a great deal of time engaging with the tourism industry.  I've come to appreciate the concept of having some plans and will now research things.  I still want to have loose agendas, but now have a few things that I definitely want to see/do, and other things that might influence the direction of my wanderings.\n\nMy first \"go to\" resource is the destination's official travel website.  Sure, they'll have the top attractions that \"everyone does,\" but they also understand that people have different tastes. Good sites will also feature lesser-known, sometimes quirky things and have events calendars. On more than one occasion, I have adjusted my original plans to add extra days in a place or have taken a long detour because of what these sites highlight.\n\nI also very much had a \"tours are not for me\" mentality.  I get to attend a number of travel conferences each year (the BEST conferences ever).  They are always in different locations and are often in places that are not at the top of my list.  The conference agendas always include half-day tours at the start of the conference and I've just started going on these and have become a big fan.  Multi-day tours still cover more ground and have more structure than I prefer, but I now appreciate a well-vetted half-day or day trip.",

Everyone you interact with speaks English.\nThe same for people on cruise ships. They aren't even having to negotiate a taxi fare or possible taxi scam! These people aren't traveling, but typically taking advantage of their good exchange rate to lay on a beach, get a massage and get drunk all week. I get that some people have kids that will limit the extent of stops they can do in a day, but it doesn't mean they should choose not to leave the resort.\n\nOn the other extreme is taking public transportation, staying at a local B&amp;B, knowing some local language phrases, researching restaurants and eating typical local meals, visit UNESCO world heritage sites, and either making friends with locals or visiting friends that live in the country to enjoy their favorite hang outs.",

When you stay in places for extended periods of time, you discover new ways of life, acquire new tastes in food, make local friends, and generally integrate a lot more. \"Walking around and looking at things\" is underselling it, you could say you \"walk around and look at things\" at home too.",

That was my most disappointing part of my trip I wish I could skip. Thankfully there was good snorkeling on another part of the same trip.\n\nMy other big hangup is all the people that get seasick. Most boat trips I've been on have multiple people getting sick.

Those are some of the more unusual ones, but I also remember the times of just chilling with locals or fellow travelers in a hostel or bar or resto. Quieter events, but equally memorable.",

For someone else it might be immersing themselves in a new culture.\n\nEveryone has the right to their own opinions, but some opinions are more valid than others. Which is where relativism ends and fallacy begins.\n\nA lot of questions have to be asked around the purpose of travel. Is it simply changing locations? Or is it doing something you wouldn't otherwise be able to do or experience at home? \n\nI lean towards the latter. I'll never knock someone for doing what they feel is right. But I do believe drinking and engaging with locals at the neighborhood bar is a lot closer to the heart of travel, than staying put in a hotel with other tourists from your same culture.",

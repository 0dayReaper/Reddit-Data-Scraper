So far, I've been thinking to arrive in Copenhagen for the first weekend, take a train to visit Gothenburg during the week, and go to Stockholm for the second weekend before flying back home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess my question is: what are the best party / nightlife cities in Scandanavia and what should I add to my trip?",

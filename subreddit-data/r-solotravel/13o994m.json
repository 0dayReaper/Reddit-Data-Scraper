    "postText": "Hi there!\n\nI\u2019m soon to be traveling in India for two weeks (early July), and am hoping to ask for some advice on trip planning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A little about me:**\n\n* USA based, 26 white male, based west coast USA.\n* Have done solo travel in Europe and Central America, so relatively familiar with \u201chow to do it\u201d.\n* Hoping to get a bit more off the beaten path.\\* Will be traveling with a 30L backpack.\n* Not terribly budget constrained, willing to pay to play, but won\u2019t be going absolutely bonkers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Trip**\n\nWill be spending two weeks on my own in India in early July before meeting up with my SO in SEA for two weeks of relaxing beach time.  I have my mind settled on India for my more \u201cadventurous\u201d bit of it.  I\u2019ve decided to heed advice on avoiding the Golden Triangle route, and **have settled on either 1. Southern India (Kerala, Tamil Nadu), or the Northeast (Assam, Meghalaya)**.  Will be sticking to whichever region that I visit for the full two weeks, and just travel by train / bus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Thoughts**\n\n**Leaning towards the North East option of Assam / Meghalaya (should I consider other states?)**.  I\u2019ll already be getting lots of tropical beach time on the second half of my trip in SEA.  Hill stations seem incredible, and I\u2019m a big fan of hiking / trecking, which these seem to cater to.  A reasonable plan thus far seems to be to fly into Guwahati, collect myself for a day or two, and then head out to more local places to adventure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Open questions.**\n\n* Once I settle myself in Guwahati (if that is indeed recommendable), where should I head?\n* Must sees?\n   * Any more mountainous / multi-day trecks that people can recommend?  Would love to see some of the Himalayas.\n* How is the \u201cwestern\u201d backpacker vibe in the northeast?  Are hostels reasonable, do they have wifi, etc.?  I\u2019m willing to slum it a fair bit, but want to check.\n* Anything I\u2019m missing that you\u2019d care to share?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you all so much for the help in advance!",

            "comment": "Assam and Meghalaya are a pretty great idea to explore NE India. You'll definitely find enough to keep yourself busy for 2 weeks. If you are interested in wildlife, Kaziranga National Park is one of the best in India and a great place to see rhinos and tigers. \n\nAs for Meghalaya, you could base yourself in Shillong and then hit the sights from there. Cherrapunji has the reputation of being the wettest place on Earth because of how much rainfall it gets, iirc it also has plenty of living root bridges including the very famous double decker one. In other parts of Meghalaya you have a few more attractions such as the Dawki river and Mawlynnong village although I'm not quite sure how far all these things are from each other.\n\nIn terms of trekking close to the Himalayas, I would suggest maybe Sikkim? Although its on the opposite side of Assam as opposed to Meghalaya so you might want to see how that fits into your logistics.\n\nI'm sure you'll have a wonderful time regardless of what you end up deciding to do. Northeast India is still in many aspects an undiscovered gem!",

I'll look into all of these places. \n\nI spoke to an Indian coworker today (she's from Kerala), and she heavily cautioned me against the rains in the Northeast this time of year (visiting in July).  Is this something I should be aware of?  She was very hesitant to recommend it.\n\nGreat rec w.r.t. Shillong, looks nice and central.\n\nSikkim also looks fantastic.  Would need to figure out logistics, but that's a great recommendation.",

                            "comment": "So actually while your co-worker is correct in saying that you definitely have to take the rains into account when traveling during monsoon season, Meghalaya in fact is even better during this time. Take for example Cherrapunji, one of the draws of this place is the amount of rain it gets and the vast lush greenery that surrounds it. There are aspects of tourism geared particularly towards the rainy season including waterfalls, the root bridges and other nature related sights and activities. Definitely be prepared for the fact that on some days the rainfall might make moving around tough and don't completely pack your itinerary so you can budget extra time for logistics in case you need it.",

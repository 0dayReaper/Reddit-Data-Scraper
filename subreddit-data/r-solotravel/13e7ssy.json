    "postText": "So this may be a dumb question, but I\u2019ve been talking with friends and there is a split in thoughts on this matter, and I would like to get solotravels opinion.\n\nWhen visiting another country that I don\u2019t know the language to, I\u2019ve always found it polite to at least know some basic words and phrases (Please, thank you, hello, how are you, cheers, etc). I don\u2019t think people expect you to be at a conversational level, but some effort into learning the local language is appreciated.\n\nMy question is, when speaking with the local population, do you immediately lead with using the local language? Or do you introduce yourself in English (or ask if the person speaks English), and then conclude the conversation with thank you or use it in other conversation topics.\n\nOne friend of mine says it is rude to introduce yourself in the local language and not know how to speak anything else beyond that. And that you\u2019re also potentially tricking the person into thinking you\u2019re fluent.\n\nAnother one of my friends said that locals don\u2019t really care, but appreciate the effort in at least trying to speak the local language.\n\nYour thoughts?",

Based on your accent and how you pronounce words, people usually know you are English and speak it.\n\nJust like I can tell tourists in my hometown, Europeans usually know whether you speak English.\n\nSome people care, others just want to get the interaction done quickly so they speak English.",

The point is not being perceived as one of them.\n\nAs an example, I know a lot of people (including my parents, who are super polite) that have the opinion that parisians are rude.\nI understand that, like in other overly tourist places, people are fed up with their city being overrun with annoying masses of clueless people. For a local, it feels like they get on the way while they are trying to do they normal routine. \nI would be annoyed, too.\n\nSo I'm extra polite in those situations, I say in bad french something like \"Hello, I'm sorry, I don't speak French, do you speak Spanish or English?\" with a smile on my face. (Saying Spanish in the first place already separates me from most of the other tourists).\nI spent several weeks in France and in Paris, and I got nothing but good interactions.\nI also learn like the most used 10 or 15 frases and a couple of ways to combine them.\nI'm sure my pronunciation must be lousy, but it just worked for me.\nIf I go to a place for one or two days, I will probably just be in the tourist spots and just speak English.\nIf I go to a place like Amsterdam, I know most people speak English, but I would still hello, please, thank you, etc in Dutch.",

Then, if you need to ask them if they do speak English \n\nWhen I was in Cambodia, I ended up well off the tourist path where more people spoke French as a second language to Khmer \n\nJust making the effort to speak Khmer and then eventually settling on French as a shared language, for the words I didn't know, was enough to impress the locals so much that they were giving me cheaper prices than the listed price\n\nEven had one woman insist I took some eggs for free. Wouldn't take a single riel for them. All because I had taken the time to learn some basic pleasantries and the numbers to be able to negotiate. (Funny story that one, she kept on saying \"you can have them\" and I massively didn't understand, took about 3 goes around before I clicked)\n\nIt's never rude to attempt to speak a local language. Even if you badtardise the pronunciation, it's often well appreciated that, you've even made an attempt",

Where in other countries if they do not use simple english and pointing they will at least use gestures to continue in a very simplified version of their native language. The Later is actually pretty easy to pick up on based on the situation and what they are saying or trying to say.\n\nAlso, I'm cautious about SOME languages and learning key phrases because the pronunciation for thank you or how much is close to an insult. For example, Shut up and  Thank you in Vietnamese is really close for the untrained ear I was there for 2 weeks and I met a lot of people who were pronouncing thank you wrong after a whole month of travel there.

In my case, I deliberately English-up my pronunciation and do a lot of brow-furrowing and hesitating right off the bat to make clear that this is about all they'll be getting out of me.

However I would not call it rude at all, but to avoid confusion it would be better to ask If they speak english right after greeting in local language. \n\nAlso this might be unpopular but I think people are sometimes overreacting and overblowing and simplifying learning Foreign language in extremely short time ( like on a flight to destination). Maybe you can learn basics such as greeting, or asking for directions and basic directions ( left, right, back, forward) but I still think it is not enough for Full conversation. Like you can ask someone direction in local language but if the answer is not \u201c go straight on then turn left\u201d yet something like \u201cgo straight on till the Yellow building, then turn left, cross the road by the bus stop, then go down the stairs and turn right and continue for 100 m straight\u201d you would probably not understand. However I agree that learning basic phrases like Hello, thank you, Goodbye and most importantly Sorry or Excuse me should be encouraged. \n\nRegarding translation apps I would also recommend caution as they do not work well for every language and there are some bugs. I would recommend simple sentences or just words without phrases. Also voice option is not always good and especially pushing your phone into someones face to speak that you can translate it is borderline rude. \n\nIn my language Google translate voice option sounds like a broken robot from cartoons. When someone plays it it takes a lot of self control not to burst into laugh. Especially if there is a twisted translation with twisted pronounciation.",

When I'm trying to buy something at a local shop or saying Hi to a cute kid, then the local language works better. \n\nIn most countries that I've visited, 'Hello' seems to be the default word for greeting each other for natives (the local language words are often left for more formal interactions).\n\nAlso, it helps to do a little more research on the local language. I'm Indian, and many foreigners who visit often learn phrases only from Hindi, completely oblivious to the fact that nearly half the country doesn't speak the language and uses a wildly different local tongue instead. In language diverse destinations like these, using the wrong local tongue can actually offend. English is safer.",

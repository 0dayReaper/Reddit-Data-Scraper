    "postText": "In a few days time I will be embarking on my first ever solo trip abroad. I am going to Morocco. Here is my itinerary as it is currently planned. I have a mix of both a hotel and a hostel in there.\n\nDay 1: Arrive in Marrakech during the late afternoon. Explore the hotel complex. Grab some food. Relax after a day of travelling.\n\nDay 2: Go on a 3 hour guided afternoon tour of Marrakech with a local guide. Explore and relax before and after this.\n\nDay 3: An excursion to the Ourika Valley and Atlas Mountains. Hiking with a local guide.\n\nDay 4: Spend the day relaxing by the pool. In the afternoon take a coach from Marrakech to Essaouira and find my hostel.\n\nDay 5: Spend the full day free-roaming Essaouira to see what the city has to offer.\n\nDay 6: Spend the morning further exploring. Take a coach back to Marrakech in the early afternoon.\n\nDay 7: \\*Night\\* tour of Marrakech with a local guide.\n\nDay 8: Relax at the hotel and catch my flight back home in the late afternoon.\n\nFor some background context. Originally I booked a spa hotel for the week in Marrakech where I planned to do excursions and tours (as I still have planned) but I later realised I might as well explore another part of Morocco so I booked 2 nights at a hostel in Essaouira. I will then be returning to the same hotel in Marrakech after my 2 nights in Essaouira where I'll still have 2 days.\n\nI'm a little nervous but also super excited for this trip. If anyone has been to Morocco solo, I'd love to hear your experience. And if you have any general solo travel advice for a first-timer, you're welcome to share below!",

Don\u2019t talk to anyone on the street at all! Don\u2019t ask people to show you directions and don\u2019t follow anyone who tells you they are going to show you a nice rooftop or anything like that. When getting off a bus or taxi, don\u2019t let anyone help you get your bags out of the luggage compartment/trunk.\n\nMorocco is a beautiful country but it\u2019s full of scammers. In fact, I\u2019ve never been to a country with more scammers than Morocco, and in Morocco they also get really aggressive really fast.\n\nSo, just don\u2019t talk to anyone on the streets. Even if they swear that they just want to practice English and make friends - trust me, it\u2019s a scam.",

Be mindful of your surroundings and trust your guide isn't there to scam you, but don't let them pressure you into buying stuff at \"shops you come across\". They're often paid a commission if you get an unscrupulous guide. \n\n2. Follow bedbug protocols. Unfortunately they're pretty common in the hostels and hotels, particularly in Marrakech. I'd advise treating your bags with Permethrin to minimize risks. It was a massive pain in my ass to try and find a clothes dryer in Essaouira so I could cook the bastards.\n\n3. Carry some TP or tissues with ya. It took me a hot minute to realize why all the kids were selling tissues. It's because the pit toilets in some public areas don't include TP!\n\n4. The merchants can get aggressive and are good at identifying \"first time\" tourists. Have fun haggling, and never accept the first offer. Or third. Work em a bit!",

You are probably aware that it gets insanely hot in Marrakech atm, so try to do a bit of exploring early in the morning till noon, then out again in the evening. If you intend to visit Jardin Majorelle, book tickets online now for the earliest slot, these get sold out cuz of the heat. Essaouira, Ourika Valley and Atlas Mountain will be cooler and much more comfortable. Most of my tips are about staying in riads and exploring the medina on your own so not sure they are of any use as it sounds like you will be staying in a hotel outside the medina. Try the hammam, I love it.",

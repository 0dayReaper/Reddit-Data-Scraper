    "postText": "I will be traveling from Seattle to San Francisco in October/November. Which National Parks should I definitely visit along the way? I like doing medium level day hikes, but am prepared to do harder trails, if the destinations are worth it. I want to travel by train but will be renting a car to reach the trailheads, if there are no busses. Any recommendations? Thanks!\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the recommendations! Olympic and Yosemite are set, now I have to decide what to do in between these two.",

Just figure out when they make them available for when you'll be in the area then put a reminder in your calendar.",

If you\u2019re able to head out to the Port Angeles/Forks area there\u2019s so much to do, especially the hoh rainforest or storm king.",

Rainier (2nd snowiest place on earth) can have snowfall as early as October which will result in roads being closed. Yosemite can get snow in November, it will remain open, but your hiking options may be limited if you're not equipped for the snow. \n\nThe more coastal parks like Olympic and Redwood should be mostly safe from snow (except for at very high altitudes in the Olympics).",

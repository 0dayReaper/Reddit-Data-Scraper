However, not sure if it\u2019s too early to tell, or how I should assess this. Any advice or insight would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "So this had just happened to me with Colombia, just a few weeks ago. I ended up going on my trip because fuck it, I bought non refundable tickets and already put in PTO. I kept on top of the news to be safe.\n\nAround 2-4 months ago, the colombian govt and many media sources were talking about the volcanic activity and conducting evacuations of the local area. They did evacuate the towns near the Volcano. The previous eruption was in the 80s and made the news due to the many deaths. \n\nBy the time that I went (3weeks ago), the government had stopped evacuations and there was no longer any concern of volcanic eruption. I talked to the locals and tour guides and they said things are normal now. \n\nIt's up to you to decide whether you want to go or not. I made the decision that it was good to go based on my understanding of the situation and I'm glad that I went because I never would've met the amazing friends that I made. If you don't feel comfortable or safe, then don't do it.",

Just wait and and see.\n\n&gt; I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s safer to cancel. \n\nObviously it's safer to stay home, but if that's your standard you can't really go anywhere. Anything you may choose to do entails a risk.",

    "postText": "Going to Japan, for the 2nd time, and for a lot longer, mostly by myself.  \nBeen to Japan before, Tokyo, during the winter time for about 4 days. Went to a few touristy places. Now going back to Japan from May 20th - June 25th. So leaving in a few days and have nothing actually planned for a big part of the trip. Specifically June 5th - June 22nd, and on June 5th I will be in Osaka. So should I keep heading south, or go super north? I would like to see both sides of the country. Am traveling solo during that time. Happy to fly, or whatever makes sense. Not that money isn't an option, but more that I am just happy to spend what is necessary to make this solo trip amazing! Posting details of general full itinerary below incase you all think I should change anything.  \nI know a bit of Japanese (major words basically). Open to meeting locals, bars, biking, hiking, arcade, anime, food, shows, festivals, night markets, anything really!  \nMay 20th - May 30th: Tokyo (2 friends arrive on the 25th. They leave June 5th)  \nMay 30th - June 1st: Hakone with 2 friends  \nJune 1st- June 5th: Osaka (with a day trip into Kyoto) with 2 friends  \n\\*\\*\\*June 5th - June 22nd: zero plans!\\*\\*\\* (Friends leave June 5th, solo rest of the time)  \nJune 22nd - June 25th: Tokyo",

Why do you want to travel there?\n\nPersonally I really like Chugoku...the part of Honshu broadly west of Osaka and the rest of Kansai. Its very stereotypically 'Japanese'.Shrines,castles,old towns, some great scenery.There is also Hiroshima there,a really interesting city and area.\n\nI also like Shikoku, which is quite rural and traditional.\n\nAnother good option is heading up to Kanazawa and then back towards the Japanese Alps, eventually returning to Tokyo that way.\n\nFar north? Hokkaido is very different.The least 'Japanese' part of the country.Its mountainous and good for trekking and nature but by comparison with the rest of the country, it's less interesting culturally and historically.",

    "postText": "I recently got out of a very long, and *very* toxic relationship. To put it shortly, it ended with me being basically isolated with absolutely no friends, other than my family. \n\nI decided to take a 3 week trip to SEA, and I\u2019m 2 1/2 weeks in. In all, it\u2019s been great and amazing! I\u2019ve been able to remind myself how big the world is, I\u2019ve had time to think, and I\u2019ve met some amazing people. The way my head has cleared has been a blessing. \n\nBut I made the \u2018mistake\u2019 of going on a cruise at the end of my trip. I\u2019m currently writing this on a 2D/1N cruise in Ha Long Bay. I figured 2D was nothing. \n\nBut being on a boat with only couples and groups is taxing to say the least. I\u2019m not a talkative person, I usually don\u2019t initiate conversation. And with so many couples doing their own thing, I feel obnoxious butting into their conversations with their partner. \n\nWhen I try to connect with groups, it\u2019s a bit better, but it\u2019s still taxing. It\u2019s been the same 21-questions thing. (Where are you from? I\u2019m from x? Oh wow, I heard y about that place? How are you fairing with the weather, etc.) It reminds me I don't have any *actual* friends - here or back home. \n\nI don\u2019t have anyone to talk to back home, or tell them about my adventures. Because of this relationship, I have no friends, and this cruise has highlighted that a bit.\n\nI just had a good cry session in my cabin to my mom on the phone.\n\nWhat do I do in this case? At least on land you can go to a pub crawl or stuff your face in street food - but what the hell do I do on a boat where you can't really outrun the loneliness?\n\nThe bay is beautiful, and I'm so grateful to be here, but I'm kinda dreading tomorrows kanoe trip. Have mercy for whatever sorry sod gets separated from their group and stuck with my awkward, uncoordinated, weakling ass. \n\nAny advice or words? Thanks.",

Sit with your pain and give it space while acknowledging - and celebrating - the strength it took to break things off. \n\nThis cruise is forcing you to sit still and be alone. See it as a gift instead of a curse. It's a beautiful way to begin getting comfortable being solo in the world. Is it hard? YES! But that doesn't make it less valuable. \n\nOn the rest of this cruise, say nice things to yourself. Tell yourself how strong you are and begin imagining what sort of life you want now.",

I called the organization who put the cruise together (it was adult only too) and explained the situation and they were happy to have me. I was literally the only single person on the cruise. I had an amazing time. I just did my thing, and relaxed, went dancing by myself, and eventually made friends with some of the couples. \n\nThat was 10 years ago. It helped me become stronger in myself and I've done tons of solo trips myself. I've rebuilt a new group of friends at home and I'm so much happier. I cried a lot, and that's OK. \n\nP.s. i find a great way to break the ice is to compliment the woman in a couple on something (genuinely). Hair, nails, makeup, clothing, jewelry, whatever. \n\nSending you hugs. This is definitely a tough time, but you can do this!",

Or jump from relationship to relationship. It can be painful and strange to acknowledge and feel the range of human feelings. It\u2019s unrealistic to buy into this 24/7 happiness search. That\u2019s elusive. I\u2019ve been solo living for about 12 years now and I can\u2019t begin to share the growth I\u2019ve experienced and fulfilling life I now have. \n\nOP .. the most difficult thing for me to learn, and I\u2019m getting better with it, was to begin checking in with myself throughout my day and naming the feeling I\u2019m experiencing and then accept it and try to gain a bit of insight from where it\u2019s coming and why. Gifts come with this mindset always. And to also be mindful of my feelings when interacting with others.",

I initially thought she didn\u2019t speak English but she did and we had a nice conversation. Wouldn\u2019t have cared too much if she didn\u2019t speak English.\n\nMy point is, you signed up for the cruise because you wanted to enjoy and marvel at the beauty. Who cares if whoever you get assigned to canoe with can or cannot make a meaningful conversation with you? Just enjoy your time in the beautiful bay. \n\nI just self entertained myself and enjoyed the amenities while I was there. 2d1n flew by real fast.",

            "comment": "Finally, FINALLY being unable to run away from the loneliness is a potential gift that few receive until it is too late. Most of the time we run and run, making all kinds of distractions and dramas in order to avoid being with -- and getting to know -- the person most central to our lives: *ourselves*.\n\n\"Always giving parties to cover the silence\", as Virginia Woolf wrote.\n\nBut when you come to terms with the silence and befriend yourself as you are (not as you or others fantasize and demand), then you gain a special power to be content in all sorts of situations, with or without other people, favorite or not favorite activities, home or away, with lots of time or time running out.\n\nWhat you can do is *surrender*. Follow the situation, moment to moment. Don't seek something else. Don't idealize some other place and time. Don't hope for things to change, and don't hope for things to stay the same. Then in the scene you're standing in, practice befriending yourself -- as if you're someone important to yourself; as if you're someone worthy of your care, encouragement, enjoyment, and right boundaries.\n\nYou can play the role of the host to yourself. You can play the role of the elder sibling to yourself. You can play the role of mentor or coach. If it helps, put two chairs facing each other and move back and forth between them: in one chair, voice the frustrated, helpless one; in the other chair, express the one with wisdom and confidence, the one who knows how to face the next moment or how to help the other side take another step.\n\nLoneliness has a true aspect: in the end, we alone are responsible for our consequences; and in the end, we alone face our death. But there is also the aspect in which we are already together with everything. Even before we are born, we are already together with everything.\n\nBehind the loneliness is big, big life. But people fear experiencing loneliness so much that they only ever run away, always trying to avoid it (and making it into a monster rather than knowing it as a powerful ally). So most people never experience depth.\n\nThis is a chance. Like Odysseus, who was adrift for ten years and who met obstacle after obstacle to his return home, every obstacle you encounter has a potential gift within it. And you do eventually find home.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you befriend yourself and come to terms with loneliness (which doesn't necessarily mean *like* it or *get rid of* it), you will also have something very real and stable to offer to future relationships, rather than repeatedly getting trapped in co-dependent mutual clinging that can never be satisfied.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere's a tip for being in a boat with someone else: put the emphasis on helping *them* have a good time. Play the host rather than assuming you are the helpless guest. Help the *other* feel comfortable. Help *them* feel listened to or appreciated. This takes the pressure off your self-judging, self-demeaning, worst-case-imagining mind. It is far more enjoyable than I-my-me fixation.",

Here\u2019s what I would do if I was on a cruise by myself (which I would totally do and I\u2019m happily engaged).\n\n- explore the boat. Walk around and check out all of the nooks and crannies\n\n- spend time sunbathing and then jumping into the pool when I got too hot rinse and repeat as necessary \n\n- read! I love books and it can ease heartbreak to get lost in a good book \n\n- Check out activities offered on the cruise \n\n- write in my journal about my adventures traveling \n\n- Nap\n\n- Book a massage if they have one available \n\nA good thing to remember too is that it\u2019s easy to see all of the couples and be jealous. But don\u2019t compare your inside pain to what you can only see on the outside of theirs. \n\nI\u2019m an introvert so I enjoy being alone and I have no problem being ok with just myself. But it\u2019s a worthwhile thing to work towards. Being ok being alone means that you can be very picky about who you get into a relationship with. And it means that your singleness won\u2019t hold you back from living your life. \n\nI hope some of this helps and gives you some peace and direction.",

Case and point last December I spent 3 nights at a resort solo and had a great time,  met a lot of people and the adults only aspect only added to the vibe.  \n\nWhat I've heard some solo travellers will do on cruises is meet and become friends with the crew members.  I can even recall a post on Reddit where a woman fell in love with a crew member (who was a married man) and it did erupt in controversy here with a lot of comments calling her out for being a homewrecker.  Very scandalous.\n\nIn the end,  I'm glad you turned to the community for support OP and hope you can salvage and enjoy your time on board.",

And I was right. It was a bit awkward to engage people at first, but I realize I don't have to force myself to talk to everyone.

One tip I\u2019d give you as a solo traveller is choose destinations where you can explore more by yourself &amp; where you\u2019d find more solo traveler\u2019s, for example Thailand, Vietnam, Bali or even South India Goa/Kerala.

Two things:\n\n1. **You're not awkward; you're just less talkative than others.**  Who cares if you're bad at canoeing: most people are bad at most things, especially things that are new to them.  The only question is whether you care enough about those things to become good at them.\n\n2. **People are different, and it's neither good nor bad: it just is.**  There's no imaginary expectation you're failing to live up to, and there's no obligation for you to be any certain way.  Can it be hard as an introvert to connect meaningfully with people?  Of course.  But extroverts struggle with that too: introverts are often better in tune with both their own emotional needs and the emotional needs of others.  Just because we perceive social value in those at the centre doesn't mean it's there.  Likewise, your own strengths as a quiet person aren't as outwardly obvious, but that doesn't make them any less real.\n\nYou're a complete, perfectly functioning person exactly as you are: you just happen to also be sad right now.\n\nThe clouds will pass...take this time to watch while you're waiting for them to go by.",

Yeah there are couples, try to find inspiration from their stories, people that ask questions will usually answer the same ones by themselves. Maybe you find out sonething interesting about work, about next travel destination. \n\nNo one says you cannot enjoy a book, or do yoga, meditate, or just get drunk and have a ffin dance off with yourself. \n\nBut try and put yourself a bit more out there, it's taxing i know, but you get some tax refund usually. \n\nAaand you always have reddit to talk to",

It will of course take a little bit to get people comfortable with you, but I\u2019ve found it\u2019s usually well worth the effort. I would just make a comment about and accent etc and then ask them about their travels and it\u2019s very likely it\u2019ll turn into a good conversation!",

Stay in, use buffets etc when you like, enjoy your solitude if you're into that. Books are cheap and plenty on amazon, I've heard, so are games on Steam and movies on Netflix.\n\nIf you want to participate in stuff, say hi, make small talk, ask questions without being \"that guy\" and actually listening to answers makes it easy to \"integrate\" a group. You'll be welcomed next time. You may end up bonding till the end of your trip and forging new friendships as well.\n\nGood luck.",

It was booked 4 years ago, postponed by Covid.   I decided to go, figuring I could go and be alone if I needed or socialize if I felt like it.  Or I could stay home and cry on my couch for that month I was gone.\n\nEnded up meeting two other solo women, who were NOT afraid of my grief, was distracted by the activities on board and excursions.  We remain friends.\n\nAt the start I was a complete mess, the travel to Buenos Aires is a fog.",

It\u2019s ok. \n\nBe consistently kind to yourself in your thoughts. Consistently. \n\nBuild yourself up, don\u2019t tear yourself down. \n\n\n&gt;&gt;\u2026it\u2019s the same 21 questions\u2026\n\nChange the questions. You be the one who asks them. One of my favorites is, \u201cWhen you\u2019re back home, what do you do for fun?\u2026If you could magically remove your obligations at home for just awhile (make a \u2018wave a magic wand\u2019 motion) what would you do for fun at home?\u201d  \n\nGoogle \u201clists of questions for conversations.\u201d \n\nIf you didn\u2019t have friends, then I\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t have a lot of fun in your relationship. Use the answers to the questions above as a springboard for ideas for your future.\n\n&gt;&gt;\u2026my weakling ass\u2026\n\nA gym is a great place to process emotions. Moving your muscles releases hormones that help you find peace and happiness. Join some gym classes and be faithful about going. Every person starts at the beginning as a klutzy weak person. No exceptions. \n\nMeetup.com can be a good place to meet people. Be faithful about going to events even when you don\u2019t feel like going at the last minute. You start as acquaintances, people join up for coffee or drinks after an event, ask to exchange phone numbers with a few that you click with, invite them to a different unrelated event (music, game night, trivia), and you\u2019re on the way to making friends. Don\u2019t be too disappointed if people bail at the last minutes. Sometimes people feel enthusiastic in the moment, but don\u2019t want to get out of their yoga pants at the last minute. It takes a long time and a lot of trial and error to build friendships. Be patient. \n\nAlways be consistently welcoming to the other new person. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through all that you have. You\u2019re going to be ok. I\u2019m glad for you that you went on this trip. It took guts. You are a gutsy person.\u2764\ufe0f",

It felt so damn awkward at first but then, I just sunk into it. Stared at the water, read a lot, listened to a ton of podcasts, started writing again. When I left for the trip, I swore it was going to be awful and now? I want to do it again. \nTurns out, being alone with your thoughts can be a really beautiful thing. \nTry to embrace it.

    "postText": "In all honesty, I'm making this post because I see so many posts of people that have had horror shows in their dorms that reach the top. I believe because these posts gain so much traction that it puts new travelers off sleeping in dorms and getting, in my opinion, a fuller experience.\n\nAs someone who travelled for 6 months through South America mostly sleeping in dorms, I can attest to the fact that there can be horror shows but that, for me, was outweighed by the positives that I managed to gain from sleeping in dorms.\n\nRocking up to a city I've never been to, I could always count on meeting at least one person in my dorm that I could hang around with and do shit with. It can be lonely to have no one around especially in a city in such a foreign country. So having that option of being able to socialise with someone in my dorm where it's just expected to have a conversation was so beneficial. I met some people that I'll never forget just because they were in the bunk below me.\n\nSo, why do you enjoy staying in dorms? Do you have any nice memories that you made because of those dorms to share?",

They all went out drinking, I went to bed early\u2026when they came in for the night, it was so cute because they were shushing each other and tiptoeing around in the dark so as to not wake me. I was just as kind in the morning to be quiet so they could sleep in. \n\nI\u2019d do that on another trip for sure if I couldn\u2019t get a couchsurf, depending on my budget.",

I always read ALL the reviews carefully and from my experience generally the \"most modern\" hostels tend to attract a better crowd. \n\nI don't mind people snoring because that's something they can't really control, I do mind people having sex in the dorm tho(which hasn't happened yet on my dorms) but that's one of the few  things I find  disrespectful to other people in the room.\n\nP.S. dorms are becoming very expensive in europe tho",

I've been pleasantly surprised at how curious and accepting younger hostelers generally are about my solo travels, leading to fun and lively chats with all types. \n\nLack of privacy and sleep-disrupting noise are a given, though. Recently, I stayed in a hostel a few days, then traveled to a nearby town, and stayed in a private hotel room for a night, returning to the same great hostel in the city where my flight departed. It was pretty perfect to get some sustained sleep and privacy in the middle of my weeklong trip.\n\nI *could* spend more money on hotels, but it would not afford me the same social contact with brave, fun, intriguing, like-minded people. I've learned a great deal about other countries and culture from my interactions at hostels, so for me, it's an enhancement of my travels rather than a detraction.\n\nNOTE: Regarding \"Americans don't travel as much as other countries\", there have been Americans besides myself in every hostel I've stayed in Europe, East Asia, and Canada.",

I am a man, but the amount of things happening that were bad experiences to me, are less than 5 times for sure. And they're only things like people turning on the lights at 3 AM or some shit. In 99%+ of times, people are respectful, friendly and social.\n\nIt definitely makes socializing a lot easier.

I\u2019ve had a couple of room mates who kept to themselves until I introduced myself and turns out they were feeling super lonely but scared to reach out and make friends!

I'd not really approach you because you give off kinda creepy vibes. \n\nSo yeah man, hostels aren't for everyone. And if you don't want to go to them then I think it'd be best both for you and for the other hostel goers :) \n\nAll the best, brother x",

I passed out in the road and the wonderful people of chang mai, whether they were locals or foreigners, took my wallet out of my bag to buy me a taxi back. Must have worked out where to send me because of the room key in my wallet. Returned all my belongings to my bag, sent me in the cab and saved my ass big time. Some phat ass American guy i had met the night before was sat out the front smoking a joint and saw me \"ragdoll slide out of the cab\" and fireman carried my dumb ass up to my room. \n\nThere's a bit more to the story, i pissed on the wall during the night and shit, this guy honestly man. What a hero. I woke up in the shower with all my piss and sick soaked clothes, had a shower, went back to the room where this saint of a room mate told me one of the funniest stories i can't remember.\n\nDorms are the best. I realise this isn't really a for/against argument, just a tale, but i totally agree with the idea of saving money and meeting people at the same time.

This is especially true if you know you're a \"lightweight\" as you put it. (I'm a 5'1\" woman who gets tipsy from two beers. I can sympathize.)

In almost every other case, my dorm stays were peaceful, the roommates were chill and I made lots of friends and travel companions, some of whom I'm still in touch with today.   \n\n\nYou're right, Reddit is full of nightmare stories because I guess those are more interesting to share than \"I stayed in a dorm and it was chill, people were friendly\"",

I never went to party hostels because it's not my scene so because of that I think the changes are slimmer that people have sex in the dorms.\nI like the hostels because I find it nice to be able to cook for myself, but mostly because I get to meet new people and socialize (if I want to).\nI do have a preference for dorms with 3 or 4 beds preferably not more. But I also slept in a dorm with 8 people and some with 6 and that was also fine. The thing I found hardest was me being scared of waking them up if I had to leave early in the morning. I would make sure I had everything I needed packed so I would be ready to go and I tried to be as quiet as possible but that is sometimes hard.\nAll in all I would definitely stay in hostels again, as I met many nice people through the hostels and they sometimes gave me new inspiration to do (or leave) certain things.",

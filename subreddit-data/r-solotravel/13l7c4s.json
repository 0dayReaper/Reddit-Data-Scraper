    "postText": "Hi guys! Booked my solo summer travels through Croatia, hitting Marusici, Sibenik, Zadar, Plitvice, Zagreb and lastly Pula. I was told to book my tickets now for July, given that I will be travelling in peak peak peak season. \n\nSome of the places like Marusici and Sibenik are a little off the usual touristy Croatia route. Any one has advice on what are the best ways to travel to and from these spots?\n\nMy hostel recommended Flixbus, but that doesn't work for alot of these places. Another recommendation was Getbybus, anyone has had experience and can vouch for these bookings? Lastly, they recommended hitchhiking, but as a solo female traveller and a horrific experience in Turkey, I might sadly pass on this. Blablacar was another option, but that would leave things to the last minute which I really don't want to do given my tight schedule given with everything pre-booked to beat the crowds. \n\nThanks in advance : )",

Both Sibenik and Zadar (and Split obviously) are definitely on the tourist track, so catching buses between the two was easy. The bus stations in Sibenik and Zadar had people who spoke English, so they can tell you the bus schedules if you just ask.",

            "comment": "I used Getbybus and never had an issue. It's an aggregator with tickets for several bus companies. When I booked through Flixbus it was often the same companies, not an actual Flixbus. You can also buy tickets at the bus station. The buses are usually late but that's just how it is. \n\nFor coastal cities, when there is an option to take a ferry I'd recommend that instead of a bus.\n\nI was there in July and August last year and booked bus tickets about a week in advance.",

            "comment": "I just got back from there and exclusively used getbybus with no problems. I did have one technical issue when booking one ticket and their support was very responsive and fixed it right away, so that's always a good sign in case problems arise.\n\nIn my experience they all departed relatively on time, but the ones I did that crossed borders into Montenegro and Bosnia were late arriving. The ones that stayed within Croatia seemed to arrive pretty close to on time. But it's probably not the biggest sample.\n\nEdit: one word of warning is that for some reason when I was on their site on my phone, when I selected a date from the drop down it initially showed results from the day prior to it, and so had to click to move it to the day I actually wanted. Since I booked a bit in advance the site might be fixed (or maybe it was some weird time zone thing causing the problem). So just be careful and make sure when purchasing the ticket it is actually the day you want, even if you thought you selected the right date when putting in the search parameters.",

            "comment": "How do You arrive to Croatia? \n\nMaru\u0161i\u0107i are in Makarska riviera which is probably one of the most touristy parts of Croatia. It is also on Adriatic highway with multiple services to/from Split. \u0160ibenik is a major town in Croatia also with decent connections)\n\nHowever If you wish to book in advance ticket from Maru\u0161i\u0107i to \u0160ibenik you can either \n\nTake a local bus to Split ( buy directly in the bus or buy at Getbybus) and then separate ticket to \u0160ibenik (Flixbus or arriva). But leave plenty of time for layover in Split just in case. Main bus terminal in Split is very near old town and one of the beaches and has several luggage storage facilities so you can even plan to arrive to Split from Maru\u0161i\u0107i in the morning, store luggage do some sightseeing and continue towards \u0160ibenik later in the day. \n\nAnother option is to ask if your host or someone from place you stay at in Maru\u0161i\u0107i can give you a short ride to neighbouring village Mimice which is listed as a stop both for Flixbus and Arriva which offer one daily Direct service to \u0160ibenik. ( I havent used those buses recently, but before Arriva drivers would stop at request at any stop alongside Adriatic Highway including Maru\u0161i\u0107i; but I am uncertain if there are some new regulation and given that summer is very busy and that there are fewer departures as of after COVID, I would not Count on that now without double checking it with someone who has more recent information)",

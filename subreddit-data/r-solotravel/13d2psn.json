    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI (22M) am planning a 6-7 week solo itinerary through Northern Central America.  I'm thinking of starting around Guatemala City, GT and ending in Managua, NI.  \n\nIn Guatemala I plan to stop in Xela, Lake Atitlan, Antigua (hike Acatenengo). \n\nIn El Salvador, Santa Ana, la libertad\n\nIn Honduras, IDK???\n\nIn Nicaragua, Las Pe\u00f1itas, Leon, end in Managua.\n\nI'm not dead set on stopping in all of these places, this was just a rough outline. I'd like to hear your recommendations.  I'm also not sure if 6-7 weeks is enough time to hit all of these places, but thats all the time I have to work with.  \n\nAbout me: I enjoy being social (i.e. places with other backpackers) and I would prefer to add another beach town or two.  I want to experience the party hostel environment a bit but am also open to more quiet places.  My Spanish is decent, so no worries there.  Also, I love hiking, so I'd love to hear your recommendations for Volcano hikes etc.\n\nThanks!!",

Aim for Sunday, ie Sunday Funday. And one night catch the sunset at the rock formation on the far end of Playa Maderas, Punta Majagual. Stunning.",

You can take some cheap scuba lessons in Utila and the people are kind. I would avoid San Pedro Sula as it is just a big city with no much to show for it. On your way to Nicaragua, try heading to Valle de Angeles or Santa Lucia, near the Capital. Beautiful small towns with vibrant colors, decent nightlife and great people",

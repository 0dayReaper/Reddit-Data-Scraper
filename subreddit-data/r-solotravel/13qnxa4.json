    "postText": "This might be a silly question, but if you have experience booking what\u2019s called a \u201cself-connecting flight\u201d on websites like skyscanner and travel with no check-in luggage (only a backpack in my case), do you still have to exit the airport and reenter security? \nI am from the United States and want to book a flight from London (LHR) to Rijeka (RJK) with 1 hr 30 min layover in Dusseldorf (DUS) and says it\u2019s a self-connecting flight but both flights are the same airline and I assume they\u2019re both at the same terminal. I understand if I had a check-in luggage then I would need to pick up my bags and recheck them but I will be backpacking for this trip. \nWhat do you guys think?",

            "comment": "I have a similar type of connection coming up, but with a connection in Singapore (SIN). From what I've gathered, it depends on the policies of the airline. Self-connecting flights seem to be a thing with discount airlines that are based on point-to-point travel rather than using traditional connecting flights. In my case, my airline (Scoot) allows for me to remain airside and just walk to my outgoing flight's gate without any extra steps. Other airlines may have you leave the airside part of the airport and check-in again for your second flight, regardless of what kind of baggage you have. I would check your airline's website for clarification.",

Since you will be coming from the UK, you probably have to exit first and then pass through security again. The risk is if the airline has a long delay, but if it's Ryanair usually they are on time.",

            "comment": "Yes. \n\nSelf-connecting flights are flights bought on two separate itineraries by your booking company which is how they get the cheap cost.  It would be the same as going to Airline A's website to book 1 ticket and then to Airline B's website to book your second ticket.\n\nUnfortunately with delays neither airline is responsible to get you to your final destination and when it comes to refunds and changes your money is tied to your booking company so you may not get immediate refunds. I prefer booking on the same itinerary but if I did separate personally I would book both direct with the airlines avoiding 3rd party.",

            "comment": "Kyra's Intro:\n\n&gt; My name is Kyra, and I'm the 34 year old SOLO BLACK FEMALE traveler, who calls Brooklyn her home. Although these days, most of my travel has been stateside, I always aim to take a good walking tour along with a deep dive of the history of every space, city and locale that I frequent. I'm a passionate urbanist who enjoys creating spaces in the arts and culture with a social justice framework and through the elevation of unheard voices of marginalized communities.\n\n&gt; Case in point, I started a podcast called **@nocountryformoving**. On my podcast, I interview immigrants and migrants from across the globe about their story, political and socio-cultural differences between their native country and their host country, and even what it's like to date outside of their culture! \n\n&gt; What is driving this AMA is that I have been traveling solo since I was 20. First to my parent's motherland of Ghana, and then to countries such as Morocco, Argentina, Spain, Colombia, Ecuador, India, and the list continues! Each time I have traveled solo, I received similar responses from friends and family, \" Are you traveling with friends? Why not choose another country to go to? Are you sure that is a good idea? And each time my response was adamant, \"I'm going and I will be safe.\" Of course, sometimes I wasn't that safe or made the best decisions, but I learned from them, and one thing that I was very sure about was that I needed to share my story and experiences with whomever I could so I could become a resource to the community as well. As a single Black woman, there have been a lot of insurmountable obstacles that I have faced that should be shared and learned from and I'm ready and willing to do that with you!\n\n&gt; My travel timeline for reference:\n\n&gt; * May-July 2008 - Ghana\n&gt; * April - August 2010- India\n&gt; * September 2010- July 2013 - Madrid, Spain\n&gt; * July 2013 - August 2016 - Buenos Aires, Argentina\n&gt; * Patagonia, Colombia, Ecuador April - October 2016\n\n\n&gt; Highlights from the Kyra Tour\n\n&gt; * Running with the bulls twice in Pamplona and only falling asleep once\n&gt; * Getting lost in Las Fallas\n&gt; * Being denied entry on the Moroccan and Spanish border\n&gt; * Chamuyando (charming) my way back into Argentina after a return flight from America\n&gt; * Getting trapped on the Ecuadorian and Colombian border\n&gt; * Trapped in Buenos, Argentina due to a financial snafu\n&gt; * Bloodwork debacles in the era of Zika\n&gt; * Almost going to jail India\n&gt; * Malaria in Ghana\n&gt; * Falling in love in Buenos Aires/Patagonia\n&gt; * Psychotic bosses in NYC\n\n\n&gt; Check out my travel content via:\n\n&gt; [Instagram] (https://www.instagram.com/kymab/?hl=en)\n\n&gt; [Facebook]  (https://www.facebook.com/kyra.bonsu)\n\n\n&gt; Join me for the AMA and follow up by listening to my podcasts @nocountryformoving on iTunes and Spotify and follow on IG @nocountryformoving and [Facebook] (https://www.facebook.com/groups/nocountryformoving) for stories of immigrants, travelers, and people like you. When you do watch an episode, please #nocountryformoving and reference the episode as well as @kymab on IG. \n\n&gt; Do not hesitate to ask me all of the questions, no matter how creepy or off-putting or uncomfortable. Since I'm gainfully fun-unemployed, I'm overeager to answer your questions. So get at me here, IG or Facebook.\n\n&gt; PSA: I'm doing this AMA to dispel the myth that Black women do not travel and to  provide an entrance into a door of a Black female travel experience. **Representation matters!**\n\n&gt; PSA2: I'm open to collaborations in the future around my podcast, so slide into my DMs or PMs.",

Congratulations\ud83d\ude1bI broke barriers by networking and going to meetups and reaching out to any friends or friends of friends in the new cities I moved to.

Other times - the city and I weren\u2019t a vibe and that\u2019s okay too and I moved on to another.",

[My wife did this](http://imgur.com/gallery/sD7kJQW) and I found myself in a battered women's shelter and I was hopeless to say the least.  My mom offered me the apartment attached to her house here in Chicago and so I left my kids (15f &amp; 17m) in California with their dad and hopped on the Greyhound.  It's been a nightmare and this was all in this month of September.  To say I'm lonely is an understatement but I promised my kids and myself this is the last time anyone will abuse me.  I'm a 36 year old woman and having to restart my entire life.  So yeah like I said some days are harder than others but I'm alive.  And yes I pressed charges.  And I miss California badly but I'll be home once I get back on my feet.  My kids are coming to visit in October if I can get a couple more hundred together for their tickets and if they decide they like it here, this will be our new home.  If not, they will go back to California and I'll be back (different city just closer to my kids) next year.",

Kudos!  \n\nAlways really happy to see fellow solo female travelers both on the internet and all over convincing other women it is entirely possible to go it alone. I'm absolutely adding your blog to my list. \n\nAnother question if you have the time? I have a close friend who also travels quite a bit (relevant context: I'm white, she's black, I do a lot of solo traveling, she prefers to go with groups of friends, both of us early 30s) and when comparing stories, she's said how while \"traveling while black\" when passing by another black traveler, like walking on a trail, there's this moment of connection where eyes meet and there's this sort of \"I see you.\" I mean, I do the smile and head nod thing to pretty much anybody I pass by (I'm a New Yorker, I appreciate them doing their thing, me doing mine and we'll all be happily alone together) and I'll admit I do feel it in my gut more whenever it's a solo woman of whatever age and background on the trail that I'm smile-nodding to.   \n\nDoes this match your experience? Also, do you find yourself intentionally seeking black folks in a hostel-like group gathering, or intentionally avoiding/seeking out folks from the states? I know when I travel I purposefully avoid \"the other Americans\" especially since they tend to be quite loud and group-y and I usually want to keep to myself. I've chatted at length with others (admittedly mostly white) about their travel-connection preferences and would love to know yours!\n\nApologies if this is rambling and makes no sense, I truly appreciate you volunteering yourself as the Reddit window into the black female travel experience. And I get to tell my family that other solo female travelers agree; if you know how to be safe in New York, you know how to be safe anywhere in the world!\n\nThank you for taking the time!",

I do often hide loud and aggressive American tourists , which are 90% of the American population because my experience and how I act is not the norm and often ppl don\u2019t think I\u2019m from the states, which I don\u2019t mind.

Fun fact-that is a no-no in India in particularly if you are a woman. We walked to our car. We just finished rolling and we\u2019re lighting up a j and then two policemen showed up and started asking us what we were doing. Then they said this is illegal to do on sacared grounds and they were taking us to the police station. We freaked! I said I was leaving the city soon and my Turkish friend said the same. My Mozambique friend/boyfriend started to plead with him. The cop said- you come to my country and smoke weed here! What\u2019s wrong with you! There was another cop behind him silently as well, a bit larger. I almost started to cry and right when he could see my friend , beginning to curse and pray in Turkish he let up. He said\u201d\nHaha it\u2019s not illegal but you really should t smoke ! It\u2019s not becoming on a woman! I won\u2019t take you to the police station, but give me your names and I better not see you do it again!\u201d",

Their country/culture/religion/social group maybe, but those things are not race. \"Black\" has many, many countries/cultures/religions/social groups, and yet a single black person will often be forced into the role of ambassador for all of them, especially when they're the only black person around.  \n\nI'm not going to disagree that women have been subjected to the above, but a disproportionate number of black people constantly continue to be. And while most of the world is starting to swing towards \"it's not okay to do this to women,\" most cultures and people all over the world are still giving excuses when it happens or thinking it's okay to do these things to black people.  \n\nYou said you were looking for some enlightenment and I hope the above will answer your original question. Please understand that sometimes black people are exhausted from explaining this sort of thing over and over again. Plus, considering how often these sorts of explanations are responded to with a defensive lashing out by the person who asked, sometimes black people need to be in the right mental and emotional headspace to prepare to start a conversation. And sometimes, they just don't have the energy, which is completely their right. After all, if you didn't want to bring an issue up with your co-worker/roommate/family member because you knew it would end in a long drawn out argument from them, it is completely within your rights to disengage early or never start the conversation in the first place.  \n\nThis might be why Kyra may not have responded to you as quickly as you wanted and also why I jumped in. Plus, she was very kindly answering questions on this thread for over 10 hours, so once she saw somebody else already expressed the sentiments she had, she only had to give an affirmation of \"yes\" to lend her authenticity.  \n\nI've had people very nicely explain all of the above to me before and I hope you can read this with an open mind and heart. You made a misstep on the internet, but hopefully this will help give you some of the context you said you were looking for.",

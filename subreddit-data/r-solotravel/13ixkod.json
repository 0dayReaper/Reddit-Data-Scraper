    "postText": "As many of you have probably heard, there was a devastating hostel fire in Wellington, New Zealand a few days ago in which six people lost their lives. The cause of the fire is unknown at this time. I extend sympathies and condolences to the families of those who passed away.\n\nDid this terrible incident make anyone else \u201cthink\u201d like it did to me?\nHearing about this tragic situation makes me think of all the hostels I\u2019ve stayed in which were clearly not up to safety codes nor did they meet fire regulations. They\u2019re usually in tight buildings with a large number of people at any given time, sometimes using questionable appliances and such. Obviously, even simple electrical issues can cause fires. Most rooms don\u2019t have fire extinguishers, hallways are narrow, only one stairwell, some rooms are high above ground without an outdoor fire escape or rope ladder, and there\u2019s usually not even a smoke detector or fire alarm. I once stayed at a hostel in San Diego, California and a dorm mate pointed out a very dangerous fire hazard (can\u2019t remember but something like: the oven and fridge were right next to the dryer/washing machine and they were all plugged into the same outlet, something to that effect). \nI know these are rare situations, but it still gives me pause. I know it\u2019s difficult for a lot of hostels to afford to make changes and improvements, but it\u2019s unfortunate that they\u2019re usually not the safest places and not up to safety codes. \nFyi I\u2019ve never been to New Zealand and it was only mentioned because of the story. Thanks for reading. This whole situation hit home as a person who loves hostels.\n\nI\u2019m interested to hear others\u2019 thoughts on this. I\u2019m sure you all have stayed in some sketchy hostels as well. Please share your stories if you wish.\n\nEdit: I should note that I\u2019m not panicking or overreacting; it\u2019s simply a subject worth discussing. I see now that it was more of a halfway house than a travelers hostel, but fires can also happen in traveler hostels and hotels. It doesn\u2019t hurt to consider this situation a reminder to check for evacuation routes and fire escapes when staying in a tight building with old electrical wiring.",

I'm travelling around Africa at the moment and most places have heavy metal bars over the windows so climbing out would be impossible even if you're on the ground floor.\n\nStrangely enough yesterday I checked into a hostel that takes escape during the case of a fire seriously, the guy checking me in made sure to show me the fire escapes and tell me the evacuation protocol and there were signs on the doors. There aren't fire alarms or anything though, the alarm would be a guard blowing a whistle and shouting fire, but I appreciate that they've thought about it. It's the first time I've experienced this in a hostel anywhere. That's not to say that other precautions are in place, as I was plugging my phone into charge I noticed the plug extension had bare wires with a curtain dangling right onto it (which I obviously readjusted).",

The scenery is so varied and there's lots to do, the people are mostly welcoming. The only down side is activities can be expensive! \n\nI'm currently in Malawi too!

Africa being cheap is a bloody myth. Have met several people out here who have also travelled South &amp; Central America and Asia, all of which have said Africa is way more expensive. \n\nMalawi is just the best! I\u2019ve been here for a while now so happy to give any recommendations if you want to drop me a message. No worries if not!",

A big part of hostelling is that it's care-free, so it's a shame to me that a single tragedy is affecting other travellers like that. Maybe it's a good wake-up call, because we never even considered a hostel as being dangerous but looking at the dodgy electrics and copious alcohol then they can be. But there are hardly any tragedies because of the staff - maybe we aren't as thankful to them as we should be.",

That being said, there are some countries in Europe and Asia that I've felt safe in at night by myself, but I'm only talking in the evening and not past midnight or anything, and only in certain areas.\n\nEdit: I also don't mean to imply that I think Africa is particularly dangerous, of the countries I've been in I've mostly felt very safe. The main exceptions being on the roads, and sometimes fire safety at hostels doesn't seem too great, which is why I commented in the 1st place. But I rarely feel threatened by people, South Africa is the only time I was a bit on edge in that respect, but it was mostly due to crime rates rather than harassment. Not going out at night alone is just a precaution that I think is advisable in most places.",

There is a good reason for the average tourist - like a great many South African citizens - to feel unsafe in what is functionally a failing (but not yet failed) state that has very high crime rates.",

I have been the first responder person when the fire alarm goes off - always false alarms, touch wood. Having to deal with fire safety has made me think about these things before: absolutely there are some hostels I loved staying at and were pretty cheap but if a bad spark had caught them it could've easily turned into a disaster. The main ones I'm thinking of are ones with thatched roofs, had alot of air-flow and walls/floors made of wood. These were also in south-east Asia where (technically indoor) smoking is not prohibited and often there were plenty of people smoking.   \n\n\nA big fire happened in my country recently and government did update its regulations and enforce stronger checks. When things do go wrong, usually it does trigger this sort of response. Unfortunately, hotels/hostels do not always have the most responsible managers and small business owners may endanger guests occasionally by trying to cut costs - like the cost of employing someone to check fire safety.  However, different countries are always going to have different standards which also will be relative to levels of economic development. Sure, you're going to be taking risks staying at sketchy places but sometimes you just gotta take risks in life if you wanna live...  \n\n\nIf you want a piece of mind, familiarise yourself with fire-safety practices, types of extinguisher, how to tell if it's expired, and stuff like that. When you are staying somewhere new, make some mental notes of  fire exits and fire extinguishers etc. Leave if you don't trust the place. I don't want to overstate this last point but there are plenty of people who will just not act safely or responsibly if a fire alarm does go off - you don't have to be one of them.",

Most places don't have smoke detectors, fire alarms, fire doors or fire extinguishers. \nI stayed in a hostel that was in a converted apartment on the fourth floor and there was a fire in one of the other apartments. The only way out was the stairwell which luckily was clear. It was the middle of the day so the hostel was fairly empty and we waited in the car park while the fire brigade put out the fire. Luckily, it didn't spread. After that I always notice the complete lack of precautions or preparedness in Balkan hostels. It's not even a question of staying in the more expensive hostels because if there are no fire regulations requiring things like smoke detectors very few hostels think to install them.",

Luckily i was in the room (they didnt notice so they thought the room was empty)and I noticed and unpluggged it. They didnt come back till 5am. It made me wonder how easily a fire could habe started.",

Just terrible news.\n\n\nWhile staying in a hostel in Reykjavik a few years back, I smelled smoke and realized the hostel was on fire (3am). No alarms were going off, so after getting my friend up she and I ran around banging on doors and yelling to get people out. Turned out to be a mattress fire in the garage attached to the building, but attached to that garage was a dorm. Thankfully everyone got out and no one was hurt or worse. It's a terrifying situation to be in.",

A few of the places were turned into homeless shelters for covid and still had homeless people in it in 2023. I had people smoking meth in the same room as me and you could hear them clicking those crack lighters all night.\n\nAnyways I thought I wanted to move to New Zealand but everything besides the nature and stuff fucking sucked so bad. It\u2019s also just as much of a racist country as the US when it comes to their native people. New Zealand is a clown country",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! \n\nI (26F) am traveling for the first time to Denmark June 3rd-17th! I am doing a \"woofusa\" farm job that I am very excited about! During my days off I am free to do as I please and would love to explore Copenhagen and hopefully Arhaus for a specific museum!\n\nWhat were some things you all hadn't thought about but realized would have made your life easier prior to traveling to Scandinavia? Or if have also worked with woofusa, what was your experience? Beautiful hiking spots in CPH or M\u00f8n? I have been learning Danish for a while, though I am aware most do speak English as well! Is there any specific advice you would have given yourself, especially for a young woman?\n\nOne more thing! I am so curious about any strange and interesting non-super-touristy spots that you enjoyed! I love old cemeteries, historic buildings, curio shops, places of cultural interest that maybe aren't just the Little Mermaid statue! \nBonus if you are aware of any Pagan/ Asatru areas of interest! \n\nI appreciate so much anyone who takes the time to read this &amp; extend your knowledge my way!",

It has some Danish art etc, but it also holds loads of Islamic artefacts (there is a Quran in there that was written 30 years after the Prophet Muhammad died). It\u2019s free to enter, and it\u2019s super interesting, if you\u2019re looking for something slightly different. All the info is in Danish tho, so if they ask if you want the translator say yes lol (unless you\u2019re quite far adv in your Danish).\n\nThe [google maps](https://TheDavidCollection+4533734949https://maps.app.goo.gl/YNYqdtFbLzDEHHSj7?g_st=ic) location. It\u2019s right next to Rosenborg Slot too, so it\u2019s super easy to find.",

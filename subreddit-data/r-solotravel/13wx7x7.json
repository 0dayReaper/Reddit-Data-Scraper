I\u2019ve researched Java, Bali, the Nusa Islands, and the Gili Islands so far.\n\nAs this will be the end of my trip, I\u2019m not looking to rush through lots of different places and would like to explore certain places to a decent level.\n\nIs it reasonable to do Java, Bali, and the Nusa Islands in a month and if not where should I cut back?",

The transport in the individual islands did take up some days as well as getting to the other island. We weren\u2019t rushed or bored and fitted a fair amount in.",

If you enjoy water activity, you could probably stay longer, but I prefer hiking and there's not enough of it here (and when there are, the heat and humidity just take the joy out of it).\n\nOverall it was a fun month. Riding trains between cities in Java was actually my favorite part. Very peaceful and tranquil slowly passing by mountains, farmlands and rice paddies.",

Definitely recommend adding Gili on there as well, laid back vibe (Gili T has good nightlife, but also easy to avoid), great waters. I visited 3 cities in Bali, Nusa, Gili, and Komodo in exactly 1 month.",

    "postText": "When I booked my vacations all I was thinking about was staying at the beach everyday and not caring about exploring much. However, this was a month ago. Now I would like to see some more stuff around the island but I don't want to rent a car. I'm staying in Benitses. Will it be hard to move around? I saw that there is a bus to Corfu town only once every 3 hours \ud83d\ude05",

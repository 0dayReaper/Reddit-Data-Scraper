Is two weeks too long? \n\nI have 2 kids age 3 &amp; 2 and I am incredibly nervous about leaving them for two weeks. I could just go for one week but the part of myself that worked as a flight medic and solo traveled for years prior to having children is screaming - BITCH, GO TO THE JUNGLE!!! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks for all the input",

Their wives have no issue with it. If you have a reliable partner and support system.. it\u2019s a non-issue. Men do this all the time, and why should it be any different for women regardless if work or pleasure? Society normalized boomer dads going on business, golfing and fishing trips leaving their wives and kids at home, why not flip the narrative?",

I think it\u2019s valuable for kids it\u2019s so easy and normalized to self sacrifice for our kids. \n\nI completely agree that I feel less safe in my own neighborhood than I do abroad and I live in a nice area in the Midwest but still, it\u2019s a stand your ground state",

I've been to Myanmar, Cambodia, Indonesia, Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Europe solo. Mexico &amp; Europe occasionally sketchy and I had to pay bribes to enter Indonesia but otherwise I do take precautions being alone in the world anywhere as a single woman and usually feel safer abroad than in the US. \n\nI was walking down a street in Belgium last summer when I realized I felt no physical fear of being shot. It's nuts.\n\nThat said, my son and I discord pretty regularly while I'm away and my parents are always on alert in case of emergencies. We only get one life.",

Honestly, they have a huge family who is obsessed with them my son is in an ice skating event and like 30 people are coming to watch him push an elephant for 5 seconds. They spend 4-8 hours a day outside, spend every Friday with their cousins, ride tractors at their grandpas house, garden, hike, are going on their second international vacation in July, they have savings for college, parents who are financially secure, parents who want them, parents who aren\u2019t living through them, they are in swim class, they love their neighbors etc\n\nHonestly- I could do 1000000 things to fuck them up and I make mistakes but having a life and an existence outside of them isn\u2019t one. Have you met the kids whose parents only lived for them? They hate it and that\u2019s not actual love- you love the child bc they fulfill your need to be needed and when they get autonomy and that\u2019s gone those parents fall apart. It\u2019s enmeshment and it\u2019s creepy and wrecks havoc on adult children.\n\nBut anyways I\u2019m def going on the trip and next year I\u2019ll take my mom on a vacation and we won\u2019t invite the kids and it will be in your honor, Fishyskunks",

    "postText": "One of the great things about travel is you get to go on lots of different forms of transportation.\n\nWhat was your favorite (or most interesting, or most terrifying, or most memorable) experience with transportation?\n\nFor me, I love cable cars (or gondolas, or aerial trams, I don't actually know what they are called).  Last summer I did a hike across the Swiss Alps following the Via Alpina....but every chance I got I would ride a cable car either up or down the mountains.  I think they are just the best form of transportation ever!  So quiet, great views, flying over treetops.  They are great!",

A couple more stops and he was closer to me. Then he pointed to his head that had a hat on it then to mine,  he then said,  You...you lose 60% of your heart through your head\". I looked at him and pulled out a hat in my pocket and he gave me a thumbs up,  both of us are bald. Totally didn't expect that.  Favorite was sea plane in Maldives, only time I flew in of those.",

(I nearly got caught, so I'm thankful we all made it back!) \n\nAnyway, flying in to it, I was aghast, from my window side seat because it was so beautiful. We landed and explored the city. (This was in 1987, ten years before it went back to China.) From Shen Zhen, we also took a train into Canton. Canton wasn't all that interesting, but the Chinese countryside was just stunning. And I loved seeing workers in the rice paddys. The countryside doesn't look like any other place I've ever been or seen in photos. \n\nI met this American guy who lived there, and he told me he absolutely loved it even more than home, but of course, that was when it was still a British colony. But when people ask about my travels, specifically beautiful cities, I mention Hong Kong, Oxford, Budapest and Amsterdam.",

And that\u2019s that. You take a small taxi boat to get to the cargo ship, jump on. And at some point a day into the journey someone comes to you to collect fair and give you your ticket",

After looking around for a while and having some people ask around for us, we finally got a small pick-up truck sized flat bed truck to give us a ride.\n\nIt was hilarious!  We were just sitting in the back, facing toward the back.  Every single person we passed along the road would stop what they were doing when they saw us.  A huge smile would grow across their face.  And they would point at us and just laugh and laugh and laugh.  Every.  Single.  Person.\n\nAnd there were a lot of people.\n\nMy parents and I couldn't help but laugh along.

While Paris (Montmartre) doesn't really hit the spot for me, Budapest, Barcelona, and Cape Town (Cape Peninsula, rather) are fun to ride. \n* And ofcourse, the metro systems of the former Soviet Union (and eastern bloc, for that matter).

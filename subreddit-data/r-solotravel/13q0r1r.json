    "postText": "Hello, I am halfway into planning a solo trip to various places in between the Netherlands and Belgium for the beginning of this December.\n\nI will be starting off in Amsterdam and working my way through Belgium. I am counting mostly on train travel but I wanted to know some recommendations for traveling from Amsterdam to Kinderdijk and go back to Rotterdam next.\n\nI am not familiar with public transport to and from Kinderdijk (or the Netherlands for that matter hahaha) but it seems that the options are mostly by bus, Water Taxi, and rideshare apps from Rotterdam after getting there by train.\n\nAny recommendations would be appreciated, as well as any feedback from traveling to the Netherlands at that time of year.",

It shows you the route &amp; times and includes train, bus, metro, etc. So I'd recommend to just input your start and destination and see what it gives you. \n\nYou'll need an OV (public transport) card to use public transport, but you should be able to buy one at any big station.\n\nAt that time of year it could be nice to visit Winter Efteling. \n\nIt can be a bit cold and rainy in December (or snowy if you're very lucky) but if you're prepared with a good jacket you'll be fine.",

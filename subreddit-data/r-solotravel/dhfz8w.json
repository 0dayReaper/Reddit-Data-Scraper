    "postText": "I (f 22) am solo traveling around Europe and have been for 2 months now. I have stayed in quite a few hostels by now and met lots of nice people and a few not so nice. Typically I stay in bigger rooms if it\u2019s mixed genders, because it feels safer. I had planned to stay in a 7 people mixed room, but got upgraded to 5. When I entered the room I saw that only one other bed was taken.  I was alone for the first few hours, but then my roommate came back. He looked close to 60 and when I said hi he just said no English. At first it was okay.\n\nAfter he had changed into his sleepwear he just lied on the bed looking at me. I started to feel really uncomfortable and decided I wanted to leave. When I came back after a quick trip to the bathroom I could clearly see that his dick was hard. I am usually not scared and think I am good at standing up for myself. I have been in similar situations on the trip before, but never have I felt unsafe in my room.\n\nAm I crazy for wanting to switch rooms when I get back? It\u2019s now 22:20 but there\u2019s a 24 hour reception\n\n\nEdit: on my way back to talk to the reception\n\nResult: A bit of a crazy ending.\nThe receptionist was very nice and offered to move me to a 4 person female dorm. Another employee followed me to my room to make sure I was okay. When we entered the room he was full on masturbating on MY bed. (Luckily all my stuff was in the locker).  The employee argued with him.  I don\u2019t know what they said as I don\u2019t understand, what I presume to be, french. Another employee came and I got my backpack from the locker. The new employee then escorted me to my new room and told me that he would be kicked out of the hostel.\n\nThank you for assuring my initial feeling. Now I am hoping for a chill day tomorrow.",

In your case, you had the right instinct despite being unsure if you overreacted.  Good for you listening to that inner voice.",

If there's no way of getting out of them staying, make sure they don't extend their stay by saying there's no availability (easy in high season). If they've got a reservation and the ID is from a local area you can deny entry based on locality (because they're not a 'traveller'). If they don't have a CC as security deposit.

I don't think there's a usually threat-feeling of seeing a man without shirt, what bothers me is when the guy immediately comes, removes all his clothes and hang around in boxers like they were in their home with no one around. It's the lack of respect to the people around them, and the certainty that no creeps will target him due to his gender.",

            "comment": "Omg. Glad you are okay. Your hostel sound like they dealt with it really well. \n\nI had a similar HORRIBLE experience. I was in an 8 bed hostel and for some reason no one else was there when I came in except for my bunkie (MASSIVE guy, late twenties , biggest feet I've ever seen). I snuck in quietly, got undressed (it was dark but maybe he saw) and decided to just get into bed in my underwear rather than rummage through my stuff for my Pjs and wake him). As soon as I got under the covers the whole bed started to vibrate like we were on train tracks and he started moaning loudly. I prayed he wasn't doing what i thought he was doing and decided to just wait it out and hope he stopped soon. He finally came, I relaxed for two minutes till he started again. He did this at lesst 6 times within a couple of hours. It was awful.\n\nI was too afraid to get up or make a sound because we were the only ones in the room, it would take me too long to reach the door, he KNEW I was there and I'm 90% sure he was wanking off to me / my discomfort. He was also massive (at least 6\"2 and those FEET) and strong enough to shake the entire bed like a jackhammer. And I was nude. And I was too scared to fall asleep in case he came down and tried to touch me (he was top bunk), I've had people threaten to do that before and its horrible. So I lay awake while he VIOLENTLY masturbate for hours. Eventually I fell asleep and woke two hours later to him doing it again and the room full of people who said nothing. Tbh I genuinely thought he must have some sort of intellectual disability to be doing that in public like that. \n\nI got up now that there were witnesses, as I left I could seee him curled up in the fetal position going at it. .. Urgh. Told the guy at reception, almost in tears and whilst he was apologetic, when he went and looked the guy had stopped (he looked three times, I guess the guy only masturbate when I was there to be frozen in fear woo) so he couldn't prove anything. I think he was just afraid to approach him alone because he said there was nothing he could do about it and that the guy was too big to drag out. When morning came I ran in to get my stuff, bumped into said dude, who seemed completely normal, looked me right in the eyes, gave me a VERY knowing smirk, said hello and shook my hand. Urgh. It still makes me skin crawl to think about. \n\nYou definitely weren't overeating but MAN I hate guys who do that. It's just disgusting, it's spreading bodily fluids and its threatening af. You have no idea what a horny guy will do one on one, and especially when you're sleeping. Also 60 is quite old for a hostel... Its a bit weird in itself. I wonder if he wanted to he caught or if hr just hoped you'd come back later and sleep in his cold spunk or something.\n\nBut yeah definitely not overreacting. I didnt sleep at all that night (apart from two hours) and cried a lot when I left the hostel. Its a horrible feeling. Its made me wary of staying in hostels and jve stayed in quite a few. Ive had some bad experiences with other travellers threatening to come into my hotel room when I'm sleeping etc too or following me back to the hostel and not letting me in / bear hugging and not letting me go till I kiss them etc. and honestly id say as a solo woman you're more at risk than you might be at home, and listen to your gut. Because travelling men often see women as easy targets and you'd be surprised how many seem completly normal at first and are secretly rapey af after a drink or two or when alone with a woman in a foreign country who couldn't really get him arrested if shit went down. You did right thing.",

We (wife and I) had an early flight out of Montreal. Went to the front desk and asked them to hail a cab. Driver is erratic, on his phone and literally scaring the shit out of us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a feeling that I needed to say something. To ask him to pull over. But I'm generally a very polite guy and didn't want to seem rude. Next thing I know he's going 85 MPH in a 35MPH zone and a car pulls out in front of us. He swerved and send us careening into the guard rail. We bounced like a ping pong ball between the guard rails three times before grinding to a halt. My seatbelt literally saved my life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we crashed he (bloodied up) tried to drive off. The car wouldn't even move- it was completely totaled. He never called 911 and instead tried to flee the scene by calling some friends to pick him up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe could have easily died in that 85MPH crash. Somehow we walked away unscathed (thanks to our seatbelts and copious prayers). But I later found out he was a shady character and had likely been involved in some nefarious activities in the preceding days. He actually wasn't even the cab our hotel hailed- he obviously just waits outside during the wee hours and acts like he is the hotel cab guy. Somehow the front desk was distracted and didn't notice. They didn't know him and said they only use certain cabs due to loose regulations that allow basically anyone to be a cab driver in Canada. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoral of the story- speak up. No one cares about you like you do. If something seems off there's a good chance it is. Who knows what this guy in his masturbating state would have done that night. Once you realize this you won't even care about the potential embarrassment of overreacting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Cab driver likely under the influences and driving erratic wrecked us at 85mph. I felt like I should've said something much sooner but didn't. Listen to your gut and speak up.",

It\u2019s part of the job of (a good) hostel staff to screen people checking in so that it\u2019s not filled with creeps and everyone is comfortable. But sometimes they slip by anyway... \n\nSO, trust your gut!! It\u2019s totally fine and never an overreaction if you\u2019re getting the heebie jeebies to talk to a receptionist or a manager and tell them you\u2019d like to switch rooms. A decent hostel will appreciate you giving them the heads up and accommodate you. They WANT you to feel comfortable!Their job is to keep people from fighting, assaulting, stealing, etc. Especially if they live on site. And it\u2019s important to say something so they can keep an eye on the person (like maybe not extend their stay or put other females in their room) and be prepared to deal with them if something like what happened here goes down. If your hostel gives you a hard time, it\u2019s a bad hostel and you should leave. \n\nHostels are communal spaces so it\u2019s up to every person to participate in helping keep that a safe space",

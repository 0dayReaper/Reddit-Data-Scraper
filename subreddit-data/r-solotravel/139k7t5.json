    "postText": "Currently on my second solo trip in SEA. I planned this trip after returning from last summers trip and I have spent the past 8 months counting down the days until. \n\nI met a girl 2 months before I left. We hit it off, spent a lot of time together, and I developed feelings for her. I told her about my trip and we both agreed at first it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to get into a relationship before I left for almost 4 months.\n\nThe week before we talked again and decided we didn\u2019t want to go around getting with other people that summer. That was our biggest concern with starting the relationship before I left. So we decided to start dating a week before I left.\n\nI\u2019ve been in Vietnam for about 11 days now and it hasn\u2019t been easy. For so long I dreamt of this trip, but now I spend most of the days missing her and wishing I was back home. I feel as if spending time with her at home would be better than any solo travel experience.\n\nI\u2019m a very social person, I\u2019m 21M, I love talking to new people and making friends. I went out with some travellers my first few days in Hanoi, yet I still found myself constantly missing her, and a sense of dread constantly in my stomach.\n\nAfter the first few days in Hanoi I decided I didn\u2019t want to wait until end of August to see her again. She will be going away from May26-July1. I said screw this and booked a flight home July2nd. I will then be going away with my family August 3-23, but that won\u2019t be too bad because I\u2019ll be with them.\n\nI have good days and I have bad days. I did the Ha Giang loop tour, made a bunch of friends, spent the nights smoking and drinking with the easy riders, and had a blast! I even considered cancelling my flight home in July!\n\nBut now, I am at a homestay Sapa, and my feelings of dread have returned. I even considered flying home a few days from now, which means I will loose the $1200CAD I spent on my flight home July2nd.\n\nI did get homesick sometimes on my first solo trip last summer, but it is nothing like this now that I have a gf. We have been texting and FaceTiming a lot, but I still feel shitty. I keep telling myself to push through until May26, then she goes away for a school placement, and then I guess I\u2019ll have some peace of mind knowing that even if I was home I wouldn\u2019t be able to see her.\n\nI don\u2019t know. Maybe Sapa is just too quiet and boring for a solo traveller. I am going to head to Ha Long Bay in a few days, hopefully being near the beach will help.\n\nI don\u2019t want to spend my whole trip counting the days waiting for it to be over, but at this point that\u2019s what it seems like I\u2019m doing. I will see her in 57 days, which isn\u2019t too far away, I know I should just live in the moment and focus on my trip, after all I\u2019ve only known this girl for just over 2 months. My brain thinks rationally, my heart feels shitty. Any advice for how to feel better?",

            "comment": "Well it's hard to give advice on this to be honest, because your problems are very relatable but honestly there's not really a right answer or really anything guaranteed to make you feel better.\n\nYou're not necessarily asking for it but I'm gonna give you my opinion anyway. I think you should stick it out in SEA. You've already booked your flight home for earlier than you would have anyway. Realistically, when looking at your life as a whole, I think you'll be more likely to regret going home even earlier, than you would staying there until July 2nd.\n\nSo ultimately I'm a proponent of taking the path of least potential regret, but I know that doesn't emotionally make you feel better. Maybe in a week or two you can call and explain to her a little how youre feeling, and you can ask her for reassurance. I'm sure she wouldn't have agreed to be with you unless she really likes you, considering you immediately left on this big trip.\n\nAlso, maybe you could have her meet you there for a week or so? maybe you could split the cost of the ticket with her. Not sure what her schedule is like, sounds like she may be in school still since you're 21, but that's an idea worth considering as well - kind of a middle ground between your ideas.\n\nBest of luck man, sorry you're in this situation. I know it's tough but at the same time I guess it's a good problem to have",

These were your goals and your adventures planned for over 8 months. You met a girl 2 months ago, dated for a week and you feel this relationship is suddenly more important than the trip. If you went home earlier, you would get to be with her but without any of the travel experiences you had planned. You can theoretically have the full trip and the girl too.\n\n\nAfter this trip, you can spend all your time together so why is there such an urgency to return now? If you're worried about her not sticking around until you're home, I have to wonder how you know being with her will be more happy, important and fulfilling than pursuing your own dreams (your trip). You made this trip happen for yourself but you can't enjoy it because you're swept up in the fantasy of your relationship. \"Fantasy\" because you assume it would be all good (and it might) but realistically, it could be bad. You don't know each other well enough yet to know how it will go. \n\n\nUltimately, it's your choice. If you can't even focus on enjoying yourself then maybe ending the trip is best. She might turn out to be the love of your life. It's a shame that missing someone was all it took for you to change your mind about this dream. \n\n\nIf you return early and the relationship falls apart, would you regret returning? Why do you think returning after your full trip would be different than if you returned now? Why doesn't she meet up with you? Especially if you have enough spare cash to consider all these return flights? \n\n\nA 1 week relationship became more valuable than all the travel experiences you've been planning for yourself. All the best with whatever you decide.",

It started off with just a date and we both didn\u2019t realize wanted to pursue something serious together. \n\nBefore he left i told him that he booked that trip before he met me, so I wanted him to enjoy it to the fullest. \n\nI was so into him. We FaceTimed lots when he was there and I honoured the moments he willingly shared with me (though we weren\u2019t officially together). I got a lot of messages from him throughout this trip basically sounding the same as yours. Things such as \u201ci booked this trip before I met you but now I just want to book a flight home and be with you\u201d etc etc. lots of \u201cwe\u2019ll do this together one day\u201d. Even FAceTiming me during nights out with \u201cthe boys\u201d. Basically we were very much into each other. \nTldr: i think it\u2019s safe to say it\u2019s not uncommon to feel what you\u2019re feeling right now. Almost freaked me out to read this because he said exactly all that. Other people go through this, it\u2019s not just you. I think it helps to not feel isolated with your emotions. \n\nFast forward to months later\u2014 it didn\u2019t work out between us. It is what it is. I know he\u2019d be bummed if he ended up not pursuing this trip to the end for me (and I\u2019d have hated that for him). Though things didn\u2019t end well, I am someone who wants to happily support another person with their pursuits, not be a hindrance to it.\n\nThere were a lot of emotions involved at the beginning of us knowing each other. I can tell you have a lot of emotions invested in this as well. Perhaps try to pull your rational side to the situation and focus on the fact that this is for your personal growth. Enjoy the \u201cfeeling\u201d by all means but don\u2019t let it cloud your judgement. \n\nHave fun in your trip op",

And if you're able to do the things you want and the relationship does work out, then you know it's right for you. \n\nThis is just my two cents (I have been in a similar situation), but I think it would help you feel better if you discuss with her about cutting down a bit on the facetiming and texting and let yourself be really immersed in your experience there. It's my personal belief that in order for a new relationship to last into a healthy long-term relationship, you have to put yourself first in the beginning.",

Anyways I just feel like cities are more for people who want to party and go pub crawling, not really my thing, im looking forward to getting out of the north and starting to head into unfamiliar territory. I\u2019m heading to HaLong bay tomorrow, booked a 1 night cruise for like 50USD, spend maybe 2 or 3 nights, return to Hanoi then start my way to the south.\n\nYou have to push through the days we\u2019re you feel like shit. I constantly sat around some days looking at reJen flights the same week, but I know in the end it won\u2019t make me feel any better. Yes, I\u2019ll be back with my family and my gf, my pets, my nice house, and I\u2019ll be back to my comfortable routine, but it won\u2019t feel good knowing that I just shit on my trip I\u2019ve been looking forward to for so long. Seeing all my friend and family after telling them I was going away for much longer. You gotta push through it and keep your head up. I think the key is to keep moving when you\u2019re stuck somewhere that you\u2019re not enjoying. Goodluck!",

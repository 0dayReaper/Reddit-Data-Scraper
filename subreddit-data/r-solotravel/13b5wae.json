    "postText": "Hi! I(F28) want to spend a month in Arizona, traveling around on the weekends and working my remote job on the weekdays. The spots I'm most interested in visiting (long list, I know I won't get to do it all): Sedona, Havasu Falls, Grand Canyon South Rim, Horseshoe Bend, Antelope Canyon, The Wave, White Pocket, Monument Valley, Canyon de Chelly, and Painted Desert. \n\nI'm not sure the best way to plan this - I'm envisioning getting an Airbnb for the month somewhere central - maybe Pheonix and then roadtripping to these spots. But now I'm wondering if it makes more sense to stay at a few different places closer to where I want to go.\n\nAny advice on a month long trip in Arizona would be greatly appreciated! I don't have a really specific question here - just trying to get an idea of where to start.",

Imo Flagstaff was the perfect spot, it's closer to everything than Pheonix is.\n\nSo far I've visited: Grand Canyon, Zion, Petrified Forest, Bryce Canyon, Antelope Canyon, Horseshoe Bend, Meteor Crater, Sun Crater, Sedona, and White Sands. \n\nBefore I leave I intend to visit Lava River Cave, Monument Valley, Canyonlands, Arches, and Mesa Verde. \n\nHere is the listing of where I'm staying, my roommates are friendly and staying longer than I am: [https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/642910947474909383](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/642910947474909383)\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to reach out.",

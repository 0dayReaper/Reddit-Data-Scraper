    "postText": "Hello! I am in my early 20s (M) from USA and had questions about my upcoming trip. Planning to stay in hostels and aiming for a &lt;$2000 trip (flights included).\n\n**I specifically had questions about:**\n\n* ***Safety:*** I have solo traveled before in Western Europe (Portugal, France, Italy, Spain), but from reading through this sub I am scared about the frequency of mugging and crime happening in Colombia and Ecuador. Even looking through the [US Dept](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/colombia-travel-advisory.html#:~:text=Colombia%20%2D%20Level%203%3A%20Reconsider%20Travel), it says to reconsider travel. I know the general rules of thumb to blend in, minimize phone use, limit night travel, etc. but should I reconsider traveling to any specific cities? I tried to limit the number of days in Quito for example as I heard that there is a higher degree of crime there.\n* ***Split between places:*** I made this itinerary last night and mainly just checked that the flights would work out. Am I spending too much time in certain places and not enough in others? Big cities are not my favorite, hence limited time in Guayaquil, Quito, and avoiding Medellin and Bogota. I enjoy exploring unique places, a bit of hiking, a bit of nightlife, and generally just getting a sense of what it's like to live in a totally different world. \n* Expectations during June: It seems like both Ecuador and Colombia are year-round destinations (to an extent). Should I expect it to be super crowded with tourists? Should I be packing for cold nights and hot days, rainy weather, etc.?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Trip Details:**\n\n***Day 1: Guayaquil*** | Chill for the day, explore the city a bit. \n\n***Day 2-4: Galapagos*** | Not sure what to do here yet, but I was seeing that this is a must-see and I should spend a good bit of time here.\n\n***Day 4-7: Cuenca*** | Fly back to Guayaquil then bus to Cuenca. This is during the weekend, so hoping to explore the city during the day and maybe go to a party hostel to enjoy the nightlife.\n\n***Day 7-10: Banos*** | Bus to Banos, sort of used as a pitstop before hitting Quito. Wanting to go rafting, to the thermal baths, and just a chill break for a few days.\n\n***Day 10-11: Quito*** | Bus to Quito and then fly out. Quick stop.\n\n***Day 11-15: Cartagena*** | Fly to Cartagena. Similar to Cuenca, this is on a weekend, so planning to partake in the nightlife, and spend the day on the beach/exploring old town.\n\n***Day 15-20: Santa Marta, Minca, Cartagena*** | Less planned out, but from what I saw in other posts, I was hoping to use Santa Marta as a hub to reach other places. Thinking of going to Santa Marta, then spend a couple days in Minca, maybe a day trip to Tayrona National Park. Then come back to Cartagena to fly back home.",

            "comment": "I think that itinerary is great. \n\nYou got the right idea with safety. Chances are you'll be fine if you're cautious. Just remember your phone isn't worth losing your life over, though most people don't end up getting robbed or mugged. \n\nGuayaquil is the most dangerous city on your list though so make sure to be safe there. I walked around one of the areas there at night and it felt a bit shady but I was lucky enough that no one tried to rob me. The locals call it Guayakill because it's so dangerous.\n\nQuito kinda sucks in my opinion. Just a bland concrete jungle but there is interesting history.\n\nCuenca and Ba\u00f1os are such awesome towns, and you'll absolutely love Minca and Tayrona Park.\n\nI absolutely love Medell\u00edn but it's not for everyone lol\n\nI think the weather will likely be pretty moderate but might be kinda cold in Quito and will probably be very hot and humid in Cartagena.\n\nHave fun man it's gonna be a blast!",

            "comment": "can only comment on the Colombia portion, but I think 4 days in Cartagena is a bit overkill... its a beautiful city but most of the tourist areas are very condensed and you can get a taste of it in 2-3 days I think, unless you are planning to stay overnight on other coastal towns/islands in the area. It's also more expensive than other areas of Colombia\n\nI would dedicate more time to the Santa Marta area over Cartagena, especially if you like hiking. Minca I'd recommend at least 2 nights, and at least 1 more night camping overnight in Parque Tayrona. Santa Marta city itself isnt much to see compared to Cartagena, but Taganga is just outside and also a cool little village for fishing/diving, and you can take boats around to beaches not accessible by car",

I don't, but you might. Guatape is nice anyway so might as well spend a few days in Medellin. Four days in Cartagena is probably overkill.",

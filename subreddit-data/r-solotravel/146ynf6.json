    "postText": "I had a travel fling recently with someone that was amazing (met once and then travelled to meet again in a different country), and I find myself trying to figure out how I feel about it. I feel like for me it was more than a fling, but I'm still not sure if it is reciprocated. It ended but we still talking, and I'm kinda trying to protect myself from getting my heart broken.\n\nI'd like to hear some stories about special flings you had. Did you keep in touch with them after it ended? How do you remember it? What made it so special?",

            "comment": "I met this girl in Santiago, Chile in March (I'm Canadian). I had 2 days left in Chile, the last day being a full-day prebooked bus tour.I downloaded tinder just for fun to see if anyone wanted to go out that night. Matched with this girl in the first hour and we went out for lunch 2 hours after that. Ended up spending the day together from noon-midnight. She's learning English in uni and I was learning Spanish in uni as well (my Spanish is bad) so a large part of the conversations was just trying to understand each other which was really fun.\n\nEnded up asking if she wanted to spend the next day together (cancel bus tour) and she said she was just in Santiago with her mum for a business thing and that she was heading back to her city in the morning (~5 hour bus ride). I asked if I could join, she said yes.\n\nNext morning she picks me up from my hotel, we walk to the metro and I meet her mother, the whole 24 hours were surreal and bizarre, completely out of my norm.\n\nOn the bus to her city I realized that if I wanted to make it back to Santiago in time for my flight the next morning I would have to take a bus back to Santiago 30 mins after we arrived in her city. She offered to stay with her and her mum for a few days. I ended up making the extremely financially irresponsible decision to accept, except I had to go back to Santiago to get my bag from the hotel anyway, so I ended up taking the 5 hour bus to her city, staying there for a few hours, taking an overnight bus back to Santiago, grab my bag and take the 5 hour bus back again.\n\nI ended up staying with her for 5 more days and had the time of my life with her and her mum. They were both so kind and I was blown away that her mother would let her daughter's tinder match, who she can't really communicate with stay with them for a few days with no notice; it was such a good time.\n\nAnyway she booked a flight to Canada and I'm picking her up in Toronto in August :)",

            "comment": "It has never worked for me. On my first solo backpacking trip in SEA I met a Swiss guy in Vietnam, we traveled for 3 weeks and eventually he fucked me over big time. I left him and never saw him again. A year later I went on a backpacking trip in South America, met an Argentinian guy in Bolivia and traveled with him for 4 weeks. Then he had to go back to Argentina and I cried my eyes out for a week nonstop, we stayed in touch for some time after that but eventually the connection faded away. Then a year after that I went back to SEA and met a British guy in Malaysia, we traveled for 3 weeks and then he hooked up with a different girl in our room and I saw it (fun times hah). We partied ways and never talked to each other after that. Then the year after that I went to Central America and met a Belgian guy in Mexico, we travelled for 4 weeks together but he turned out to be an aggressive alcoholic that would become emotionally abusive every time he was under influence. So we partied ways and I decided that I don\u2019t want to see him ever again.\n\nIn total I spent 6 winters in a row abroad, total length of backpacking trips - 23.5 months. Aside from these 4 guys I had shorter flings here and there. Some of them felt very special in the moment, like a very strong chemistry and a promise of a good connection, and then some of them I can barely remember now. There were guys who I met again - I visited them in their home countries, they visited me in my home country or we agreed to travel to a third country together. None of that worked in a long run.\n\nIn my experience it\u2019s very hard to make it work. You\u2019ll have to go through a LDR which is hard and not everyone can do it, and then eventually one of you has to make a sacrifice, abandoning your country, family and friends to move to a new place for your partner. Personally I don\u2019t think many people are willing to do this sacrifice. I\u2019m surely not willing to risk my everything for a guy.",

We immediately clicked, like we knew each other from before, and after 3 days of the first meeting, I moved in with her. We made common friends and we behaved just like a normal couple and for me, it was one of the most amazing summers I had in my life. Full of joy, fun, love, etc.  In the end, I had to leave back to my country because of work but I promised her that I would come back.  \nImmediately when I came back home I told everyone that I was moving to the Caucasus and canceled my rent. So after one and a half months of not seeing her, we met again. She was cold as ice and she told me for the first time that she is not interested in \"us\" anymore. She left and I just stood there on a cold autumn day with my backpack trying to understand what just happened. After some time I realized that at least for her it was a summer fling and for me something more...\n\nIn general, I am glad that we met and that this \"summer fling\" happened. I am also happy that I got this extra motivation and moved away from my country to the Caucasus where I still live now. We are unfortunately not in touch anymore but memories and experiences will stay forever.",

It was funny but I found that because I met them while travelling, everything about them was romanticized and I had viewed them thru rose tinted classes. When we spent 2 weeks together I realized he wasn\u2019t as special as I had made him in my head. I\u2019m still happy it happened but we haven\u2019t spoken in a few months since. Travel flings happen but I think you\u2019ll feel strongly when it\u2019s more than a fling and you\u2019ll be confident they feel the same way. With this, I was questioning him the whole time and my feelings also really fizzled out once we spent more time together",

Everyone loved her. She's awesome, beautiful.. Would date her in a second. We still chat! Might even travel together at some point who knows. We've talked about it but we're both very lax about it. And that's how we both are in general, things that are meant to be will be! Our paths were meant to cross for sure but we're not fated to wind up together imo, don't think she'd ever move to the US anyways lol.

Said our goodbyes and I went to Vietnam. She works in Thailand, and during my travels in Nam' I really started missing her company. Messaged her and said I'd like to meet her again, so I flew back into Thailand and stayed with her in Udon Thani at her aunties house for 2 nights. Then we went to Bangkok together, at this point it was getting more serious. I met her close circle of friends, we did touristy things together, and also had really nice local experiences. We also went to Rayong together. She had to return to work, but after I spent some time on some islands I returned to Bangkok again, and we spent another 2 weeks together. I flew to Australia this March to begin my working holiday visa. It was sad to say goodbye (she even came with me to the airport), but at this point we were in love and just knew it would be a challenge long distance for a while until we could be together again. Sadly, recently, she messaged me saying that she is giving up on the relationship. Long distance just killed it I think, plus the challenges of our future together (marrying a Laotian girl has an insane amount of hurdles to jump through). Still going through some depression of the breakup, because she really was wonderful. We are still on good terms. I'm grateful for the wonderful times we had together.",

I of course enjoyed having guides in different cities so I downloaded tinder (gold) and got to swiping. While in England, I had stayed with a guy I had met a few months prior via a travel website and we fussed like we had been together for years and had the most intense snd amazing sex lol. We were together in England and Scotland for a week. He talked about me moving there and leaving America behind but uhhh no. I\u2019m American proud lol (me being sarcastic). Great and meaningful fling though!  Then off to Spain I went. This guy was a big shot. He knew where all the hot spots to party and was just full of energy. It was amazing scoring VIP to the hottest night clubs and sipping on the finest champagne. We tried having sex but it just wasn\u2019t getting up. I wasn\u2019t mad though because I really wasn\u2019t physically attracted to him. Next stop Greece lol I thought this would be the place I was the wildest but no. I stayed with someone I had met months prior via a host website and it was just odd. He acted like we were married. I had to be home at a certain time. I had to eat dinner with him. I had to answer all his text on where I was. I did meet a very nice guy there who I went to a dance party with but of course my host wasn\u2019t having it so we didn\u2019t get to have as much fun as we hoped. Oh did I mention the host tried to sleep with me lol he wanted to give me a \u201cmassage\u201d and then went immediately down on me and I was like WTF the whole entire time. I couldn\u2019t wait to leave. Next country was Poland. This was the most surprising of all my escapades lol. I met someone months prior via Reddit who wanted to show me around but then I also met some ppl via tinder. (This story would take forever to tell so I\u2019ll fast forward) Long story short, my tinder date was odd. He wanted to marry me and stay in my flat my entire trip and I said no you have to go I have family coming lol. He serenaded my window one morning and just kept popping up and when I wasn\u2019t there he would blow up my phone lol. I quickly blocked him and asked for security from my Airbnb host. Anywho the guy who I met via Reddit was a gentle and kind soul. I was wasted so I kept changing plans with meeting him but he was so patient with me. He took me to see some German/Jew/Polish  history, the best restaurants to eat authentic polish food, took me to the best coffee shops, took me to the best place to have cheesecake! He was so kind. He never came on to me and never acted like he was interested but y\u2019all\u2026.I WAS SO INTERESTED. I randomly asked him while sitting at candlelight in a restaurant eating cake did he want to come back to my flat and he looked me in my eyes and smiled. He said sure. Let me tell you we had the most amazing back to back to back sex. I hated it was my last night there.  I was going to cancel my next leg of the trip but he told me to go explore the world. We kept in touch for awhile after I left but he wanted me to so desperately move to Poland and I just couldn\u2019t at the time (and COVID had just started lol). I wish this had been more then a fling. He was intelligent and beautiful. But, Anyways I hope y\u2019all enjoyed my crazy stories lol! Tinder is a funny place to meet ppl as well as other sources! Just be safe and have fun :)",

We met up in Spain maybe less than a year later and we had an amazing time. We decided to try and make it work, I booked a trip to see him in his home country (Europe) I am in North America and he booked a longer stay trip to visit me. However after my brief visit in his country, we felt different and broke it off. It was kind of a quick sparks and then burnt out fast. He did come to visit still on the trip he booked and I was more over it at that point and we still keep in touch. I know I don\u2019t have feelings for him at this point and I don\u2019t have issues keeping in touch with him now. This all happened probably 4 years ago at this point. \n\nI would say while traveling the realities of regular life are less evident and there\u2019s some rose coloured glasses feelings. It works for some but the relationship plus distance and time difference takes a massive mental toll.",

            "comment": "Although I've had several small flings with people I've met overseas, my story right now was domestic. My friend invited me to visit her in another state back in April (2mo ago). My only goal when i visited her was to put myself in new and uncomfortable situations so that i can re-discover who i was again. I had ZERO intentions on finding a man to be with or flirt with, or anything of that nature. Not even 5 minutes of me sitting at the hotel bar, a man my age came up to me and we started talking. We ended up talking and hanging out in the lobby the rest of the night and we exchanged numbers. I met up with him the following morning before I left, and he drove me to the terminal. We hugged and kissed goodbye. We talked every single day since, have had many facetime/phone dates. We both live in different states, and he even flew out to see me 3 weeks after we met. Since April, I flew out to see him twice and now visiting him a 3rd time next month. So far, it's been absolute bliss and he's so amazing and I can't believe this is happening. Although we've only known each other for 2-3 mo, we've flown out to see each other every few weeks. It's still extremely early to tell what the future holds (we're basically just casually dating long distance), it's been such a romantic journey to remember. Being in different countries is definitely more difficult, but I do agree with a previous comment that there has to be a finite goal to see each other or else it won't work.",

            "comment": "Im in month 4 of a 6 month trip now. In the first month in SEA I met a German guy (I'm American). We were not attracted to each other at first but after hanging out for a few days, an attraction developed. We ended up spending 10 nights in total together and it got very intense and amazing by the end. He was only on a 1 month trip so he went back to Germany and I kept going, but we texted every day and FaceTimed every few days. It was really awesome for about two months and I definitely had big feelings for him. We started to feel less connected to each other as we did not see each other for a while, but we had already made plans for me to visit him in Germany (we even said originally that I could stay for a month). Because I felt less connected as time went on, I got triggered when he told me went on a date in Germany (which he was free to do) and I told him I feel like I will get hurt in this situation, which then caused him to feel differently. We talked it out and still agreed that I would visit. When I got there it didn't feel like before and I only stayed 4 nights. We talked about everything and were able to connect again and have a great time while I was there, but we knew it was the end. I think we were just in different places. He just got out of a 6 year relationship a few months before we met, mean while I have been single for 6 years (with lots of flings during that time) and very ready to meet someone. In the end I'm sooooo glad we met and grateful for what we had because he is a great guy and we communicated openly and thoroughly the whole time. Even when he told me he didn't feel the same and didn't want me to stay, I felt safe with him because of how candid and kind he was.",

The airport will be curfew and closed between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. I see a Ryanair flight that goes to agadier at 6:00 a.m. I'm thinking of just sleeping here maybe 8 hours to blow.\r  \n\r  \nI'm tired as hell and I'm not thinking straight could use your help reddit",

Last time my RyanAir flight was delayed by just over 3 hours and I got them to pay me \u20ac400 for the delay. I just got in touch with RyanAir via email and sent them proof of delay and my flight details.",

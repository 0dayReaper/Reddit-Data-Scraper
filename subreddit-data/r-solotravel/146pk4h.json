If they are another expat they might now know the area that well or speak the local language either. What do you guys think? ",

            "comment": "How much choice do you really have? If you arrange everything in advance I guess you can go out of your way to get whatever you want, but otherwise you get what is available. You may be able to choose between a handful of guides, but often they just assign someone. A museum or site has just a limited number of guides on staff, often assigned in a specific order for a fairness. A tour company generally won't offer you a choice and the number of tour companies for a specific tour is often limited and the tours are likely somewhat different too. And realistically, does it really matter? Knowledge and presentation are much more important for the value you get out of a guide. Sure, there are extremes where languages skills are lacking, but these are often places where native speakers can't be found anyway. I don't use guides that often, but if I do, I deal with the circumstances, talk a bit with them to judge whether proficiency is sufficient.",

Then you can see what matters. Their nationality often doesnt matter. You can have an american historian tell you more about Paris than a random paris local for instance. Of course it could go vice versa, that's why their names are important. If you see a tour offered with no names listed, it just doesnt matter, who you get.",

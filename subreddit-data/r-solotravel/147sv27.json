    "postText": "Hi, I am seeking advice for my first big road trip by myself. \nI live in Connecticut in an apartment with my two dogs and my lease is coming up at the end of July. I made a big decision to move to Arizona as I think it will suit me and my personal interests better. \nSince I have my car, my items and two pups, I would prefer driving rather than flying. Especially since I am on a tight budget as I proceed to save until I leave. \nI also have just turned 21, I am a female and fairly short and look young I would say. So this is kind of intimidating to me for safety reasons. \n\nI guess my questions are :\n\nwhat should i prepare for when driving the 38 hours? (im going to drag it out into hopefully a 5 day span)\n\nwhat should i bring that i absolutely need and keep me and my pups safe? I dont want to over pack. and i am nervous to run into creeps .. \n\nshould i get AAA just in case anything happens to my car? \n\nare hotels or motels better for the trip there? \n\nthats all i have for now but any advice helps.",

I give myself 6-7 days so I only have to drive in 7ish hour increments, otherwise it\u2019s way too much car time for the animals. Make sure you have AAA and always keep an eye on your gas, at least from florida there are long stretches in Texas with almost nothing around. \n\nNicer motels are easier with animals because you can just walk into the room hopefully on a first floor rather than take the elevator, etc. download BringFido app for pet friendly hotels. If they get anxious you could see a vet beforehand and maybe give a low dose of gabapentin to keep them calm, that\u2019s what I do with my cat. Keep some mace on you just in case. Good luck",

Better options to let doggies stretch legs in dirt/grass. Also agreed on the timings. I just did a short stretch in state and just got sleepy, the road can lull you. Mp3 playlist, podcasts or audiobooks... keep your mind occupied if you get bored.\n\nAAA a must, keeps any unforeseen flats fair for any cost. Of course do the vehicle checkup before. Ask them to verify your spare option and/or any tools. Know where these items are before you leave in case AAA or you have to use them. AAA for car also, first aid for doggies and you. Tummy stuff, headache analgesic, bandages, etc. I haven't traveled with pets but I've heard of doggie calmers being used. Depends on your case your dogs... Ask a vet.\n\nLast, not affiliated but I use the cellphone app, Waze. A secondary Google Maps, better at telling road hazards, traffic thickness in urban areas (a must) and emergency or police ahead of time. Audio mode keep your eyes on the road and Bluetooth on my phone it justs interrupts my roadie playlist with good extra safe notices of hazards ahead.",

It is worth a bit more money to stay at a nicer motel further into a suburb. \n\nMap out your route and try to find some dog parks along the way. Your pups will likely want to stretch their legs just as much as you do! Same with dog-friendly restaurants where you can all sit on the patio and relax. Don't leave your dogs alone in the car!\n\nSome safety tips: \n\n* Avoid driving after dark. Plan on arriving at your motel for the night by late afternoon so you can scope out the area a bit and settle in for dinner and dog walks. \n* Download Google Maps to your phone for offline use. You'll likely drive through areas where you have zero cell service but will still need your map. \n* Be aware of your surroundings when you stop. Is someone else stopping each time you do? Be aware of that. Drive to a police station if you want to see if they're really following you. \n* Share your location with a trusted friend or family member and keep them updated. But do NOT post on social media in real time. \n* Never tell anyone you are traveling alone. If someone asks if you're alone tell them you're meeting up with your girlfriend in the next town, your boyfriend is napping at the hotel, your cousin is at the grocery store up the street, etc. Be vague about your route, plans, and next destination. \n* Carry water with at all times. It gets very hot driving through the Southwestern states. You'll need water for yourself, your dogs...and possibly for your car if it starts to overheat (that's why you'll need AAA!)",

He\u2019s a very mellow dog but the downside to him sleeping all day is that he was ready to play at night. Along with being a little unsettled for the first night at any new place, my sleep was not the best so something to consider when breaking up your day. BringFido is a great site for pet friendly hotels. We mostly stayed at La Quintas. Varying quality and some do have pet fees even though they are pet friendly so make sure to check that out. \n\nI never felt unsafe but did come prepared with a good emergency road kit, a newly tuned up car with new tires and a AAA card. I would highly recommend the AAA and you may also get good hotel deals on it. \n\nBring food and water for you and the pups. That give you more control over where to stop if you are nervous about stopping at night. Heavily traveled truck stops are your friends. Lots of people 24:7. \n\nHappy to answer any other questions!",

I mapped out my trip ahead of time so I knew where I wanted to stop each night and could book a dog friendly hotel in advance.  I also looked for hotels in more suburban areas rather than right off the freeway.  For lunch I always stopped in more populated areas so i could find a safe area to walk him.\n\nDepending on the size your dogs I'd look into ways to make their area in the car as spacious as possible.  I now have a hammock setup for my dog in the car but for the long trip I had a piece of sturdy plywood cut to fit and fully cover the back seat and floorboard area, added legs for support.  Then wrapped it in cheap carpet for some padding.  I put his bed and a blanket on there as well.  This way he had a much larger area to spread out and lay down comfortably.",

I went a bit out of the way to drive through the Smoky Mountains and Asheville and stayed a few days in DC. If I could have done it differently, I would have capped each day driving at seven hours. It can get taxing if it\u2019s not something you\u2019re used to and adding in extra time for pup stops. \n\nIt\u2019s a great way to see the country though! I would suggest keeping a cooler of snacks and water for both consumption and emergencies. July and August are very different the further southwest you go than New England. Get a roadside kit and jumper cables for your car, as well as getting your car checked at for any maintenance before you go. \n\nGet the pups in for a quick vet visit for paperwork, tags and if they\u2019re microchipped, to make sure the contact info is correct. \n\nCheck in with someone each day, even if it\u2019s just a quick text to let them know where you are. To add to that, if there\u2019s an emergency contact info/option on your phone, or you have an iPhone, add that info if you haven\u2019t in case anything happens. \n\nParts of the central plains and southwest can get very desolate so I would plan hotel stops ahead of time. I also never let my gas tank get below the 100 mile range. \n\nTrust your gut when it comes to your surroundings and just be aware and cautious. \n\nFind a few things to see along the way too! \n\nI hope you have a great time!",

I really like this app called RoadTrippers for plotting out how far I want to drive each day and what hotels are nearby. \n\nAs for where to stay, for me personally, i found it was worth paying a little more than staying at the cheapest place. I just felt safer at Best western or la Quinta compared to Days Inn. \n\nI also recommend having snacks/water with you, and just put on an audiobook.",

So you\u2019ll want to be especially mindful of where you stop, having plenty of shade and grass for yr pups to get breaks, etc. Rest areas are best IMO for stops like this (esp in daytime). Have a plan you feel good with for stops with yr dogs (ie how will you use the bathroom, where will your dogs be, etc.) I plan for a little extra time when I\u2019m traveling with my dog bc I stop more frequently to give her plenty of break times.",

I would drive from 6:30 am to about 4-5 pm each day. \n Have always stayed at LaQuintas right off the highway as they are very dog friendly. Have also stayed at hilton home2suites . Both are very good and I liked the locations right off the highway. Easy off and on. I also googled the hotel to get feedback on properties. Have not had a single issue with either hotel chain. \nBoth hotel chains include hot breakfast and I also tok cereal and apples for the ride.\n As others said, fill up when you get to 1/2 a tank, I did this which was about every four hours of driving so took dog for a walk while I stopped.\n \n Portable dog bowls were helpful for water breaks but my dog slept while I drove and handled the trip better than me.\n We stopped at a lot of trunk gas station/rest stops like Loves. They were safe and busy and had bathrooms/small dog park/enclosure too. \n I\u2019ve done i80 via Iowa/Colorado/utah and i44/40 via Missouri/Texas/ok/new mexico. Both are ok.\n What I had done is pack my valuables into one bag and always brought that into the hotel at night. More for piece of mind. \n \nLaQuintas I have stayed at which were safe and dog friendly:\n Catoosa Ok \n Albuquerque downtown\nGallop new mexico\nSt george utah\nHilton home2 suites I stayed at which were nice:\n Hammand Indiana\nBloomington Illinois \nEdgewood ohio\nDenver downtown \n \n \nI packed a case of waters, snacks, granola bars, gatoride, hard candy. Safety things like flashlights, cell phone charger bank, etc. also had the car inspected. Tires and wipers should be in good shape. \n Also add about an hour to two hours for stops/lunch/ dog walks. \n\n Its not cheap (gas $500, hotels 600) but thats what I do for the dog. \n\n Good luck, let me know if you have more questions",

The chance of anything happening are very low, but a flat tire can happen anywhere and you'll be glad you have someone to call if it does. \n\nTry to plan ahead for where you're going to spend the nights, and make sure they are pet friendly. Don't spend too little on a motel, you definitely get what you pay for. If you have a lot of your possessions in the car, make sure they are as much out of sight as possible, or cover them with a blanket when stopping for the night.\n\nHave fun and don't try to rush it - I did the same when I moved from NY to Utah a few years ago, and it's a great way to see the country.",

The major highways going across the country have rest stops and gas stations reasonably spaced out.  Hardest part is deciding how you want to break down the days but that\u2019s all up to how long you are willing to drive a day.  Always be aware of how much gas you have and the next gas station available, there are signs posted if it\u2019s the last gas station for a while.  Keep some snacks and water in your car for emergencies.  For me that\u2019s a 3 day trip tops but I don\u2019t mind driving for hours at a time.  As far as sleeping goes it also depends on your comfortability. I sleep in my car at rest stops or gas stations but some people can\u2019t do that.  Definitely get aaa for emergencies tho.  If you do sleep in hotels make you bring your luggage into the room, if it\u2019s visible in your car it can be stolen. And obviously making sure they are pet friendly",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI've got a serious question. I have taken long day trips before such as SLC to Vegas in a day with friends who were studying abroad, and I've gone from similar places in Arizona to Vegas in 6 hours. I'm not afraid of a long car or train ride. This is why I'm asking my question.\n\nI've recently discovered the excitement of going to the northernmost point in Japan at wakkanai because I follow several japanese YouTubers who take fun train journeys. I looked further into a route from Sapporo to wakkanai at work yesterday and discovered that there's a really beautiful and cool looking series of roads I can take to get there along the coast. The entire 5 or 6 hour one way drive would be ok the coast which sounds amazing.\n\nTaking a train would be about 6 hours or more, doesn't see the coast much, but is covered by the Jr pass.\n\nI'm staying in the susukino part of Sapporo on the first day u get to Japan as well as a couple more days. Afterwards I'm leaving to go to a few more cities. So, my question is whether I'd be able to justify and have enough time to still enjoy Sapporo and the areas around it such as the salmon museum and the Ainu museum if I also take my trip to wakkanai. I've been to Japan and worked there before, so I'm not in a hurry to get to typical places, and I plan on renting a car later in Okayama as well, so I'll have a license. I'm just concerned about not being able to park my car at the hotel I've booked and not being able to drop off the rental that night as they close at 8. I'd have to park somewhere and wait to return until the morning, but that could be great as it does allow me to also drive more and even sleep in my car if needed.\n\nSo, a few questions:\n\nWould you recommend driving from Sapporo to wakkanai along the coast, taking the train which only leaves twice a day, or just staying in central Hokkaido?\n\nIs there anything I can do to not feel disappointed if I don't go to wakkanai? I'd hate to travel after making these big plans, especially since I haven't had a vacation in 10 years and then feel awful not visiting somewhere.\n\nAny other recommended things besides the university, downtown areas, and the Ainu or salmon stuff to do in Sapporo if I don't head up to wakkanai?\n\nRegardless of what I do I think I'll enjoy my first trip to hokkaido. It's been my lifelong goal each time I've lived and worked in Japan, but I've never been able to make it happen yet.\n\nThanks for reading. I appreciate any help planning this solo trip.i really enjoyed reading the guides here when I took my last solo trip to Poland and Germany last fall.\n\nI know this should belong in japantravel, but the mods over there don't understand this is a serious question from someone committed to enjoying his vacation and making a trip happen.",

The exception would be if you had time to take the ferry to Rishiri and rebun national park. I spent a few days on Rishiri and it was a highlight of my trip.",

I'm not prepared for a hike this time though. So I might just have to consider making this for the next trip. If I could spend two weeks or a month on hokkaido that would be great.\n\nI really want to also hit the southeast part and check out some smaller towns. Hokkaido is always a place I'm considering buying an older house, so I'm sure I can always find time to make it back and look around.\n\nThe coast going up there looks so enticing though. When I looked at street view at work last night I fell in love. I'm planning on looking at a few trip reports from japanese blogs tomorrow while many subs have their blackout.",

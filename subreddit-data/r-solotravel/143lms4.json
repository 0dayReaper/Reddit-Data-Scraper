    "postText": "I was in Kuala Lumpur walking around Chinatown and was going to get a grab car(like uber) to get back to my hotel when I realized that my data was not working.\n\nI rely on using google maps to get around these days so this was a problem on multiple levels. However, I surprised myself and did not panic.\n\nI walked around a little bit and got dinner. Then I stopped and grabbed ice cream and the woman serving very nicely gave me her wifi password...but it didn't work. I had no internet.\n\nI could try to get a cab, but I just wandered around a bit as I had no immediate issues. I saw a sign for the metro, and walked toward it but I thought it wasn't going to be much use as I did not know the metro stop by my hotel. I thought I might be able to ask someone but didn't have much hope.\n\nMuch to my surprise, the metro listed a mall that I had seen very close to hotel as an addendum to one of the stops listed so I figured I'd give it a chance and paid around 50 cents for my fare.\n\nTook the train in the wrong directly originally so got off and then back on the train in the correct direction.\n\nExited out the station and I see a restaurant I recognize and am able to get back to my hotel!\n\nMy favorite thing about this was I did not panic, even once. I feel like I could(and have) easily spiraled in a situation like this but I was legitimately not worried. Not really sure why but I will say that I grabbed a physical map from the hotel the next time I left just to make sure I had something with me.\n\nETA: Thanks for all the great comments. I know I should have downloaded google maps, just whiffed it.\n\nTo the judgy comments, this is why I don't like to post here sometimes. I'm glad you think this is a non-issue. What I was trying to explain was that it was a non-issue to me too, but had this been my first solo trip I would have probably panicked. I fell out of the habit of carrying maps, downloading them etc. and no matter where you are, not knowing how to get \"home\" can be stressful. ",

Normally, like with Google Maps that OP was using, it would obviously be a digital map.\n\nAll a GPS is is a calculator, clock and satellite receiver. Apply some relativistic math (Einstein was right!) And you get coordinates. That's your position. Everything else - pathfinding, etc is from the map side of the software, with nothing to do with the GPS part (except when it updates).\n\nI use GPS software a bit when I travel, usually to mark scuba dive sites.

And not stressing about getting on the metro in the wrong direction.\n\nI remember being proud of a friend and me for learning how to use the \"boat-busses\"  (for lack of a better term) on the river in Bangkok. This was before ride sharing apps, and we didn't want to pay for taxis all the time.\n\nThere were no instructions posted at the docks about how to get a ticket, or how to pay for it, and we had not done any research on that before we got there. But there WAS a map of all the stops the boats would stop at (according to their color) and their schedules.\n\nSo we just sat and observed how others did it. We noticed that they just lined up and got on, and nobody seemed to be checking any kind of tickets. So the next boat that came -- that's what we did. We just got on.\n\nThe way it worked was that a woman came around shaking a money can while you were on the boat, and you handed her some bills, and she gave you change. After I got change the first time, I knew how much the fare was for the next trips.\n\nAt the time, it was the equivalent of like 50 cents or a buck to ride the boats, so it was really easy to get around to the temples and tourist sites.\n\nBut it's the memory of being proud of ourselves for just figuring it out is what I remember about that.",

Most hostel front desks, airport arrivals areas, bus or train stations had plenty of free or cheap tourist maps. I still often prefer paper maps over navigating with my phone, since it's easier to see at a glance where to go. Tourist maps usually point out interesting sites and attractions. And they make great souvenirs after the trip.\n\nMore to the point, learning to read a map and not rely on GPS is a basic life skill that everyone should know, even just as a backup. It just blows my mind that so many people have no clue how to use a paper map and are so reliant on their phones, which can get lost or stolen or the battery can die or the data won't work. Getting a sense of where you are and developing a sense of direction are skills that will serve you will in all travels.",

I guess the important thing is to know the key points in the town - where your hotel is, where is the river that flows through the town, what is the name of the mane street... Just keep your eyes open for any landmarks.",

That being said it is hardly an issue to panic for as there are dozens of ways for someone to get out of a situation like this. Also kind of sad that if we don\u2019t stare at our phones all the time we are not even able to read basic instructions and get on the right platform at a metro where there are only 2 choices. But then again, happens to everybody, not judging",

This has happened to me before as well!\n\nFor me, as a woman, asking someone for directions is not always the best choice because part of safety as a female traveler is looking like you know where you are going and not calling attention to the fact that you are alone.",

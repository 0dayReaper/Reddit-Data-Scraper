    "postText": "\nPlanning a 3 month rental in Portugal this summer, wondering what\u2019s your opinion of Lisbon? Visited 10 years ago and loved it.. but heard its changed allot and become very \u201cdigital nomad\u201d. My very general question is has it lost its authenticity or still worth doing a summer rental? Is there a better less touristy option in Portugal. Looking for a traditional Portuguese city, good restaurants, low key nightlife and access to surf. Final question; my budget is $2,500 a month is this enough for a good centrally located apartment in Lisbon?  Thank you in advance for your help, appreciate it.",

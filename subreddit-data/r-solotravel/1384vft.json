I am a 25yo female if it matters - usually a solo traveler. Appreciate any help :)\n\nDay 1: Arrive in Panama City 7AM - Plan to take the night bus to Bocas del Toro\n\nDay 2: Bocas del Toro (any hostel suggestions?)\n\nDay 3: Back to Panama City\n\nDay 4: Panama City - Bodhi Hostel\n\nDay 5: Panama City&gt; San Blas tour\n\nDay 6: San Blas &gt; Panama City\n\nDay 7: Panama City - Bodhi Hostel\n\nDay 8: Leaving in the morning\n\nI wanna plan most of it in advance because it is such a short time. Thanks :)",

Been travelling for past 6 months (9 different countries) But by far the most mesmerizing landmark I've seen was Mt. Fuji. Just as jaw dropping the 100th time I see it as I did the first time. \n\nFeel free to ask me any questions about japan or solotravel in general. \n\nAlso, more Japan: https://imgur.com/a/C87u3qY",

For 72 hours, it's less than $5 a day to take as many subways as you want (only subway line, not keio or JR, but you can get anywhere).  You can also buy them at some of the camera and department stores.  Bowl of ramen or sukiyaki is like $5-8.  Food can be cheap.  It can also be stupid expensive.  It's all delicious tho.  You can do plenty with $50/day      ",

No, $65 is only for Japan. \n\nAustralia was way more expensive, I was there for 2 months and stayed in Airbnb for a full month. Then lived in Sydney (most expensive city I've been to) and then to Tasmania.\n\nMalasyia, Indonesdia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand were all much cheaper, around $30 a day and you can be very comfortable. \n\nSo no, not $65 a day. I work online (software dev) and so I like to be very comfortable while I travel  so my daily budget is a bit more on the expensive side, as I mentioned, you can drag that $65 for Japan budget down to $50 easily. \n\nLet me know if that helped and if you've got any other question, feel free to ask!",

The people in big cities (especially younger people) tend to know basic English, and restaurants have English menus. You can also use hand gestures/Google translate if they really do not understand. Just learn some basic phrases like thank you (arigato) and excuse me/sorry (sumimasen) to show courtesy",

                    "comment": "&gt;But do you every get lonely?\n\nIt depends on the person I guess, but for me it's perfect. I stay at hostels most of the time and there's plenty of people to socialize with. You can use apps like meetup to meet new people too.\n\n&gt;Why did you choose to solo travel if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\n\nDon't mind at all. I'm from Canada where winter is really cold, dark and depressing. I can work from anywhere and so getting the hell out is the only sane choice. My first time doing it, and I'm wondering why I didn't do this 5 years earlier. But why I choose to solo travel? I wouldn't mind travelling with other people, but it's hard to come across a travel buddy who can travel for 6 months. I did find someone to travel with though in Cambodia, Vietnam and Australia so that was cool. \n\nLet me know if that answers your questions.",

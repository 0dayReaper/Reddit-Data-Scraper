    "postText": " \n\nHi Everyone,\n\nI'm near done mapping out a trip to Vietnam from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi. I have a hostel for Ho Chi Minh but plan to just find places to stay as I go and stop. I\u2019m getting a motorbike so these places that are for 1 day are just stop overs with maybe \u00be of the day for exploring, hence the odd day calculations\u2026just want to be realistic.\n\nIn total the trip is 29 days long but ultimately wondering what people\u2019s opinions are at the times in these locations? Am I spending too much/too little time in places or prioritizing the wrong places? The only thing set in stone is Ha Long Bay, I\u2019ll need to be there by the 26th day. My hostel in HCMC is also booked but was $12/night so is a wash if things change.\n\nThe trip is pretty linear so things to an extent can be cut and put other places. Would love folks opinions cause most things I read say everywhere is amazing and I don\u2019t have all the time haha!\n\n**(3.75 days) Days 1 to 5 Ho Chi Minh City**\n\n**\\*I originally had 3 days is this too much time at 4 days? Worried Jet lag will put me out of commission for the day, but I arrive around noon my first day**\n\n**(1.75 days) Day 5 to 7 Phan Thiet/Mui Ne**\n\n**\\*Should I take a day here and give it to Dalat? Should I skip?**\n\n**(.75 days) Day 7 to 8 Dalat**\n\n**(1.75 days) Day 8 to 10 Nha Trong**\n\n**(.75 days) Days 10 to 11 Quy Nhon**\n\n**\\*Could go straight to Pleiku but have heard good things about Quy Nhon?**\n\n**(.75 days) Days 11 to 12 Pleiku**\n\n**(2.75 days) Days 12 to 15 Hoi An/Da Nang**\n\n**(1.75 days) Days 15 to 17 Hue**\n\n**(1.75 days) Days 17 to 19 Phong Nha**\n\n**\\*Wanted to do only 1 day but think if I wanna see the caves will need a whole extra day**\n\n**(.75 days) Days 19 to 20 Vinh or Thai Hoa**\n\n\\***OR I am going to skip and take a bus from Dong Hoi to Ninh Binh saving a day**\n\n**(1.75 days) Days 20 to 22 Ninh Binh**\n\n**(3.75 days) Days 22 to 26 Hanoi**\n\n**(2.75 days) Days 26 to 28 Ha Long Bay \\*Already booked**\n\n**(1 day) Day 28-29 Stay Near Airport in Hanoi and Go Home**",

            "comment": "1.  Rent a Honda XR150 in HCMC from a company which allows dropoff in Hanoi.  Don't buy one of those counterfeit Honda Wins.\n\n2.  Cut HCMC down to a day or two.  Ride straight north out of HCMC.  Your proposed route looks like mostly flatland Highway 1 riding.  That is the worst route to take in Vietnam.\n\n3.  Ride down out of the Highlands to Hoi An, and then over the Hai Van Pass to Hue.  Then ride QL49 to QL14 and overnight at Khe Sanh.  Or just skip Hue and ride to Prao and head north.  The Hai Van Pass is a relatively short ride.\n\n4. QL15 along the Laos border to Phong Nha will be by far the best ride of your trip.\n\n5.  Skip Vinh.  Stay to the west for the rest of the ride to Hanoi, and enter Hanoi from the west.  I have done this several different ways and it is much better to come in from the west.\n\n6.  Why stay west and in the mountains for most of the trip?  Cooler, less crowded, less dangerous, more scenic, fewer cops.\n\nThe key to having fun in Vietnam is to talk to people.  In general, Vietnamese are quite friendly and hospitable.",

I don't wanna mess with the clutch as I haven't ridden for some time so thought the automatic for this trip would be good. \n\nI'm thinking of just taking the bus from Phong Nha to Ninh Binh? I heard I'm not missing much? But I don't know if that bus can store my bike as some do.",

Thanh Hoa to NB is going to give you a taste of the suckitude that you have mostly missed by staying off Hwy 1.\n\nThat bike will be fine.",

    "postText": "Looking for travel for a long weekend somewhere in the US. I am getting a divorce, and taking a weekend to spend time to myself and try to figure out what the fuck to do now that I\u2019ll be a single mom. I would love to get recommendations on the best city to visit and have some \u201cMe\u201d time. \n\nIdeally:\n-In the US, within the Eastern or Central time zones. \n-In a \u201ccharming\u201d little town (safe for a 33 year old woman to walk alone)\n-Things to do outside my door (I would like to avoid driving)\n-Breweries/wineries\n-Bed and Breakfast with a soaking tub\n-Spa\n\nCities I have considered:\nMontpelier, VT\nPortsmouth, NH\nCharleston, SC -this is my #1 pic so far\n\nBudget is \u2026flexible? I have a good bonus coming in next month that I was planning on using for a romantic trip for us, but fuck that, and I\u2019ll spend some of it on myself instead. \n\nCheers to hopefully the first of many solo trips, now that I don\u2019t have someone telling me I can\u2019t.",

It\u2019s such a laid-back city and if you stay somewhere downtown you can walk to lots of good places to eat, shop and more. They have quite a few art deco buildings, the Grove Arcade is one and the Asheville Citizen-Times building is another. I lived there for a few years and I still miss it.

Although there is a lot of touristy attractions,  it doesn't feel as distracting.  I could get lost in my thoughts and appreciate the city far more than Charleston.  Also, the metro of Boston is very effective and easy to navigate. Google maps will be enough to guide you. \n\nPeople with more experience in either city might disagree.

There is wine tasting with their own wine brand. The brewery scene is also good in town. The estate was professionally landscaped that is beautiful this time of year. You would miss out on this if you were to visit the house again during Christmas that is popular for all the Christmas decorations.\n\n2nd go to Shenandoah national park near DC. There some nice hikes and a lodge you can stay at up in the mountains. Near the park is also several wineries yup can visit. There are all the multiple FREE Smithsonian museums in DC and you can go check out the Hope diamond for ideas for your next wedding ring Ha ha!\n\n3rd is New Orleans French Quarter. You can do a food crawl by getting an appetizer at various restaurants. Enjoy some good jazz at night. French quarter is pretty safe, but might want to be careful walking around outside the French quarter late at night. Inside the French quarter, avoid the drunk crowds on bourbon street early in the evening.",

My favorite was an area in North Charleston that had a lot of restaurants, some distilleries, and bars, it skewed late 20s early 30s crowd. It was way more chill than the touristy areas, the food was fantastic, and very friendly locals. If you go I would definitely recommend going on the first tour of the day to Ft. Sumpter, the boat ride the to the fort (included in the entry fee) is beautiful and you get all that fresh ocean breeze, you can see and participate in raising the American flag at the fort if you\u2019re in the first tour group of the day.

Downtown has lots of little bars and brew houses, plus things like theaters and restaurants and all other kinds of entertainment venues. And even more near the university. Look up pictures of Main Street at night to get a sense of how the town looks.\n\nUnfortunately, it's not particularly walkable as a whole, but the downtown area is easy enough to walk from end to end, and other neighborhoods are  short Lyft hop away.\n\nOption #2: Alexandria, VA. I live near that area right now, and it was the first thing that came to mind when you said \"charming little town\". It's got a quaint,  rustic sort of charm, and it's lovely to visit in the spring or summer. It's just outside Washington DC and Arlington, so you're also pretty close to upscale city entertainment as well. Basically three cities for one trip!\n\nI have never been a tourist in either city, so I can't recommend any hotels or BnB spots, but other than that I hope this has been helpful.",

There\u2019s so much to do that\u2019s not just food and drink focused. It\u2019s all relatively close together, and there will be other young folks to meet that are likely solo in some way themselves (Georgetown, young political staffers, etc.)\n\nI think the issue you might run into with other, smaller cities is finding reasonably affordable lodging that has the things you want (soaker tub, spa). Just thinking off the top of my head for locations like Savannah and Charleston, you may end up shelling out more for a boutique type place in those cities, as opposed to the Four Seasons or someone else in DC with a top notch spa. \n\nI know budget is flex, but it\u2019s something to think about if it\u2019ll end up saving you $500+. There\u2019s no reason to spend $600 a night in Charleston to get in a small boutique place because they\u2019re the only place with a tub/spa with availability. If you can get in somewhere like the Four Seasons for less a night, personally, I\u2019d rather take that ya know? Of course, where you want to be and what you ultimately want to do is most important. There are plenty of things to do in Charleston and Sav, but I also know food and drink is one of the biggest things to do there.\n\nEdit: forgot to say. Make a list with your top 5 locations. Try and narrow it down to 2 or 3, then go to a website like getyourguide and look at the primary tours offered. Typically, that can help you get an idea of what most visitors are looking to do. If it\u2019s a bunch of bar crawls and food tours, maybe that city is not for you this trip. Then can help you narrow it down, then you can go further by looking at lodging prices. Have fun! The trip is always awesome but planning for it is even more exciting.",

Charleston is an amazing food town with Fripp Island not far away, the beer has some work to do. Ithaca, NY is a beautiful place for the summer time with the wineries and more restaurants per capita than anywhere else in the country (old stat). \n\nBottom line, they are all winners - be kind to yourself and congratulations on turning the page.",

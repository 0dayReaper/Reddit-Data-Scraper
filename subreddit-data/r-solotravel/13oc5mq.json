    "postText": "Solo traveling through Argentina, was boarding a flight out of Buenos Aires and as I approached the boarding gate they were requesting people to have their luggage checked due to bag capacity within the cabin. I complied and agreed to have my bag checked under the plane. Did not think too much about it and take out my cash before handing the bag over. Upon landing at new location and checking into hostel I was getting ready to pay for my stay. Opened my luggage and all compartments were torn apart and all of my money was gone.\n\nI know I should\u2019ve been more cognizant of removing the money before handing over my luggage but I\u2019m just very frustrated and upset as I still have 10 days left on my trip. Don\u2019t really have much else to say just needed to vent lol. \n\nMake sure you keep tabs on your important belongings 100% of the time.",

But if I can give a little advice as an internet stranger who has a habit on dwelling on mistakes like that, don\u2019t, don\u2019t dwell on it, tell yourself that it was a learning experience and that you won\u2019t do it again. Move on and enjoy the rest of you trip as much as you can (obviously the lack of funds may make things difficult but try not to let the act of losing it colour your time, if that makes sense). Best of luck!",

When you're in the pit of despair, appreciate it'll be a tiny blot on a far-flung horizon in a few months; in a couple of years it'll be a distant or long-forgotten memory. I was robbed of a couple of thousand dollars in Romania and just stayed in my Airbnb room contemplating it for several days (the landlady kindly put extra toilet tissue outside my door, thinking I was sick). I came to the conclusion a) stop carrying thousands of dollars on you, you moron and b) it'll be something you learn from and a valuable lesson. Since then I've been much more cautious and it isn't difficult after that experience.",

Have it on your body or the handluggage under the seat in front of you. Been on a local flight in Brazil, before takeoff there was an announcement in Portuguese. No idea what, but probably not important as it wasn't repeated in English. Arrived at destination, and my backpack was gone from the overhead bin. Looked like they announced something like: \"would the owner of the small black backpack a few seats behind me please put it under the seat in front of them? We're short of space.\" And as I didn't take it it was unloaded. Yeah. Great.",

    "postText": "First, I minimized from multiple countries to just Peru -- 2 weeks turns out to not be a lot of time! I wouldn't mind being laid off, b/c during my research I had about another 3 weeks of things I wanted to do. Second, I don't care too much about just visiting sites -- there needs to be some sort of physical or mental stimulation or tremendous novelty/beauty. Hence, I have no interest in a place like Rainbow mountain. Third, no matter what I do -- I want to practice Spanish every day! Duolingo is slow and boring! Nothing beats practical learning!\n\nBonus question: how long does altitude climitization last? so if I am in Cusco at the beginning of my trip, does that mean I am good for the rest of the trip? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 1 - flying in\n\nDay 2-3 - land, acclimate in Cusco, activities TBD or free explore\n\nDay 4-7 - 4 day Salkantay Trail to Macchu Picchu! I get to hike, camp, stay in domes, try local foods, see the Humantay Lake. Plus Huayana Picchu.\n\nDay 8 - Whitewater Rafting near Cusco (I decided not to do the Jungle Trail to Macchu Picchu, but really want to spend the day doing this) and if possible, I'd like to get to Huaraz, north of Lima, flight + bus after\n\nDay 9 - Laguna 69, a gorgeous lake that looks like a portrait I have of a place in Norway\n\nDay 10 - Flex Day - Nevado Mateo, b/c I figure why not try hiking in snow? Or head to Lima.\n\nDay 11-13 - 3 days to hang out in Lima, chill, try the food, dance bachata, go to couchsurfing meetups, Airbnb experiences, explore.\n\nDay 14 - fly out at 1am (going west, so I'll land at 1pm at home, same day)",

For some truly stupid reason in lima, there is no connection between flights, and you have to exit the airport and go through security once again before catching your second flight (both for national and international flights).\nAltitude sickness is completely subjective. Do you have any previous experience with altitude?",

After 4 days of going up and down stone steps, the last thing you may want to do is climb up a mountain for 3 hours. It cost over $50 and I just went because I\u2019d already paid to do it.\n\n2. If it isn\u2019t too late to change, go to Cusco/MP towards the end of your trip. You need to take it easy for the first few days at altitude, so do it after you\u2019ve spent an active week of whatever else, and might appreciate the downtime more.",

I am an avid walker/hiker and consider 20-25km per day to be normal, so I figured the 8-16km of the Inca Trail would be easy. Nope, the altitude and the stone steps make it\u2026 torturous, the regret in the eyes of everyone over 40 (11 of our group of 15) was evident. Renting walking poles is crucial. I heard the Salkantay is tougher than the Inca, so good luck!\n\nThe upside is that the food is amazing, hopefully you like guacamole, because the porters will pick fresh avocados from trees along the trail to make it.",

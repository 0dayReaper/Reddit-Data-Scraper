    "postText": "Anyone else solotraveling struggle at all with making time on catching the bus/train? Going from city to city can be exhilarating but it can also make me extremely anxious when I have to figure out the metro bus layout of each city in visit. So far I've been in Naples/Rome/Milan/turin/Lyon/Paris and it's just frustrating how many little things can go wrong. Relying on Google maps until the bus is coming an hour after google said or scheduling a bus ride until you miss it because you miss 3 metro stops along the way because you don't know where the f to go or you realize last second you're on the wrong side of the metro \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Maybe I'm the only one struggling here but it can be a real pain in the ass.",

I started travelling before internet &amp; smartphones, so you always had to leave plenty of buffer-time, and ask locals - learn VERY WELL those few phrases \u201cwhere is the xyz please\u201d in local language, AND the replies that you\u2019d need to decipher.  These days even with modern miraculous smartphones they can sometimes trip you up by being wrong so you still need to leave plenty of time.  They sure make things hecka lot easier, though they can sure take much of the fun out of adventures - just feel like a robot having no contact with locals nor having to work things out yourself.",

            "comment": "You're just learning how to navigate a city by its metro system for the first time. \n\n\nYou are learning to pay attention to the name of the last stop to determine the direction of the metro. You are learning how platforms/different lines might be far apart even though they are the same metro stop. You are learning what signs to look for. You are learning when to use metro maps.\n\n\nThe more you do it, the less you'll struggle. You'll have a new skill and the confidence to use any metro worldwide. \n\n\nDon't trust google maps worldwide. Some places are always on time, some places have a more relaxed approach to transit. Don't rely on google trip durations and give yourself enough time so you can take a moment to be confused without feeling panicked.\n\n\nLogistics is the source of great frustration for any traveller. Shrug it off when you goof up. Everybody goofs up their connections now and then. \n\n\nA tip for the bus (especially when they don't have official stops/stations) - if you can, I like to find my way to the bus stop before the day I actually take the bus. That's my preference because I can get frazzled if I'm late and confused about where to go. Or see if you can use your ticket for the next bus (if there is one) and then you don't need to rush.\n\n\nAlternatively, you also have the option of taking a taxi/uber/bike to the stop. In your story about being 3 stops too far and getting turned around, that might have been an option for you or something you can do next time.",

I show up at least 30mins early every time and be mentally prepared to wait an hour+.\n\nSo to make the best of it, I either just chill or stretch.\n\nEDIT: for those long train rides, I set an alarm. So if I take a train that says it'll take 5 hours, I'll set a countdown alarm for 4hrs 50mins. That tells me to start paying attention and figure out where the hell I am.",

I\u2019d already spent all my local currency in preparation for leaving the country so I had to scramble to get more and get a taxi that wouldn\u2019t rip me off to get to my bus on time. I made it with twenty minutes to spare and I had allotted two hours of fuck up time.

    "postText": "I just read a post about a guy who got scammed in Vietnam and it makes me think about how many countries have people like this. People swarming you asking you where you're going and if you want a ride, people coming up to you in the street offering you a 'friendship bracelet' or some shit. People following you and pestering you for shit. In which countries can you walk around even in busy, touristy areas and just be left alone? Which countries can you arrive at a station and not be pestered?\n\nI live in Taiwan and this has never happened to me to anyone I know. People completely leave you alone. The same also seemed to apply to Japan and South Korea but in Europe it seemed to happen everywhere (less so in Eastern Europe). Also the UK doesn't seem too bad but I'm from there so maybe I blend in and people don't target me.\n\nWhich countries have you been to where this kind of stuff just doesn't exist?",

My metro card (Suica) fell a couple of times from my pocket when pulling out my phone and people would follow me to hand it back to me. 2. In the metro, when people saw your friend group/ family sitting together and you were standing up next to them, they would free their place so you could sit with your group. 3. A girl helped me print some vaccination papers",

Also the girl who helped you was at a 7eleven printer? \nWhat I meant is that they mostly stay among themselves. You go to the Istanbul metro and quickly find people standing by the ticket booths trying to help, saying the machine doesn\u2019t work, offering their cards. And they are clearly all scammers. Whereas the same example in Japan the metro can be a bit daunting to foreigners but you will never find someone just standing there giving help or in general people who approach you talking in English striking up conversations. Which is good from the point of view of scam risks",

I also was helped by a staff worker when printing a drivers license translation otherwise it would have taken me ages :) but again, I think people pretty much mind their own business whereas in some other places they are more \u201cfriendly\u201d and will approach you more often if you look a bit clueless as many are in a very different environment. And this leads to potential scams. Another example are temples, shrines etc. You will not be approached by guides all the time, some telling stories that you need to purchase a specific ticket (which is the maximum tour package) or stuff like that. So hooray for Japanese consideration, respect, honesty and not giving a shit about you :)",

The story about cutting the hand of people who steal is a myth I think, at least I have never seen a person with only one hand there.\n\nBut you really shouldn\u2019t worry about this if you travel to Saudi Arabia, as long as you respect their laws and culture you won\u2019t get in any trouble (Which is true for almost every country I guess )\nAnd as others have already mentioned the Saudi hospitality is really amazing and I felt really welcomed.\n\nAbout the scammers, of course there are some especially if you take the taxi you better check the prices with Careem or Uber. But other than that I didn\u2019t encounter any issues with scammers",

Had a few people try to sell me stuff in other contexts there, but no interactions felt like a scam or scam attempt.\n\nAlso never had anyone try to scam me in Switzerland or Norway. Generally speaking, wealthy countries where most people have a good standard of living are probably unlikely to have a lot of scamming, whereas poorer places, or places with wide wealth disparities, may be more likely to have scams.\n\nRather than refusing to go to any place where scams happen, though, to some extent I think it's worth just getting informed about common scams and knowing what to expect. In many places simply ignoring any stranger who approaches you in the street, especially if it's a touristy street, means you can dodge the vast majority of attempted scams",

Guy wouldn't take no for an answer and even put his arm around me and subtly tried to drag me into the hotel. Honestly KL seemed rife with scammers but everyone's experience will vary. Also willing to bet the areas outside of KL are much safer.",

I'm a fairly short woman (so not intimidating at all) but I used to be blonde and that attracted a lot more attention than my dark hair does. Sometimes I think I slip past simply because they don't see me haha The only places I have not even seen scammers are the UAE, Iceland, Denmark, Fiji and Switzerland but I'm sure they're there.",

When I opened my wallet to look for coins he swiped a bunch of notes. Kinda my fault for not being vigilant but i was young and assumed a guy asking for charity donations wouldn't have taken my money. That's probably an anomaly though. Never saw anything like that again in Berlin.",

    "postText": "First time solo traveling. 24M. Day 1, had a long layover in London so went into the city. Ended up getting scammed $500 (partly my stupidity)\n\nHeading to Singapore for more solo travel after this. Feeling down right now, how can I make sure that this experience doesn't ruin the rest of the trip?\n\nEdit: thanks all for the comments, they've helped a lot. \n\n.\n.\n.\nTo answer the Q about the scam:\n\nWas walking across the Thames. There were groups of people surrounding and gambling on this game where a ball is hidden under one of three cups and you need to guess which one it's under. Choose right and you get the money\n\nSo I was spectating just for fun and there was this one time when I shouted the answer. Given my angle, I saw where it landed and knew I was right. There was a pile of money from lost bets, and then the host of the game was pressuring me to bet $$. Since I was confident, I did. But the host must've knew I knew the answer, took my money, and then demanded that I redo the game to win the points.\n\nOfc at that point I lose $$. I was defeated and angry since that wasn't what we had bet on. \n\nOne of the other guys then promised to help me win back my money by playing again. I think it was a scheme to take advantage of how I was feeling, and that these ppl were part of a group. I lost again, and then left\n\nKnow it was my fault for being gullible , which is why I feel really down - I shouldn't have gotten involved on the first place,  but the idea of winning a lot of money and the confidence I had in winning convinced me otherwise\n\n.\n.\n.\nTldr; dont get involved in these games, you'll always lose",

            "comment": "Not specifically travel related, but my dad told me once that experience is expensive. Meaning that the hard lessons we learn out in the world are usually costly ones. That made me feel better because my parents are pretty wise so it was good to know that they too had learned some things the hard way - i didn\u2019t feel quite so stupid after that! \n\nYou\u2019re out there learning how to navigate new places, which is great. When you have days like that, chalk it up to experience and one more step on the journey towards wisdom, then keep walking and leave it behind you. You have fantastic things waiting ahead and the good will far outweigh the bad.",

I will only part with money to someone I have approached myself. Like in a shop or online shopping. Anyone approaches you to ask anything at all, money, advice, to take their photo, say no thanks, and keep moving. It's rude but it's safe. All it takes is a one second distraction and that's it.

Doesn\u2019t matter. The point is, you paid 500$ for a very important life lesson. You aren\u2019t stupid, these people are scumbags that know how to use human nature to trick people. You\u2019re not the first and for sure not the last to fall for these, there\u2019s a reason they go out in the streets every day and do this, it brings in money and people still fall for it.\n\nCheer up my man. Look at it as a learning experience rather than hating yourself for it. In a few weeks this\u2019ll be a funny story you\u2019d tell friends and family.

I have memories for the remaining 10 days of Vietnam, which I will remember for a lifetime.\n\nSo remember it\u2019s okay to be down, human to have good days/bad days, pick yourself up, think of the exciting things you want to see or will be seeing for the first time in Singapore &amp; enjoy the rest of your holiday.

If you see a street game and you want to watch a guy work his technique, sure, throw down 5bux if you can do it safely - like without flashing a wallet or a bunch of money. But don't expect to walk away with it because they're not in the business of losing money. If they bait you by letting you win a little, expect their friends (who are acting as other passers-by in the crowd) to shake you down or outright mug you if you attempt to walk away while ahead.\n\nBut honestly, your best bet is to not get involved. These sorts of games are also fertile grounds for pick-pockets because of how distracting they are (and causing people to reveal where they store their cash).",

This is a very metropolitan city, no one is sat on the street playing games with any genuine intention so you will always lose out because that\u2019s their purpose. Don\u2019t get involved, don\u2019t even watch.\n\nThis is in my biased opinion, one of the greatest cities in the world and you\u2019re in luck, it\u2019s been so sunny the last few days which is the very best of London. What I would do to turn your trip around: go to Rotherhithe, follow the signs to the Thames Path, spend the morning walking along the river to London Bridge looking at all the old wharf buildings and the famous sky line north of the river. Once at London Bridge, go grab some food from Borough market, it is touristy but locals will go there too because it\u2019s great.\n\nShouldn\u2019t take more than a couple of hours but if you\u2019re not much of a walker or you\u2019re short on time, start at London Bridge, get the Thames clipper/Uber boat to Cutty Sark - see all the same sights while sailing down the Thames for the price of a tube. Once at Cutty Sark check out Greenwich Market and it\u2019s also worth going up to the observatory to see the view. \n\nThe Thames path walk is one of my favourite things to do in London and was my pick me up during the pandemic, every time I do it I feel such gratitude for this city and this life, so hopefully you would feel the same.",

            "comment": "Stuff like this happens even if you have never imagined you'd get scammed like this. Now you know to get as far as you can from situations like this. \n\nI got scammed out of ~170 euros once by a taxi driver in Prague. I went to a Rammstein show 4 years ago, didn't want to wait for a tram or bus back to my hostel after the show and hailed a cab. Turns out, it's something you should never ever do in Prague, because the chance of getting scammed is very high. First of all, he probably manipulated the meter so the price was way more than it should've been, and when I gave him the money, he turned around and then claimed I gave him the wrong note - less than I supposedly should've (and I know for sure I gave him what he asked). So I had to give him more money because I started to feel threatened. I got back to the hostel with a very shitty feeling, which sucked because the concert before that was awesome. I did a google search to see if it's a common type of scam and turns out it was, and for some reason that made me feel a bit better.\n\nIn general, as bad as it might sound - tourists are prime targets for scams, especially in very popular tourist locations like London or Prague. I'm not saying you should be paranoid in every place you visit, but pay attention to what's going on around you.",

We're human, we lapse in judgement! \n\nTo answer the question, and this may sound counterintuitive but if I'm having a bad day, I just go with it. I ride it out. I'm kinda pedantic with plans and schedules so when things go awry, I tend to spiral along with it. I now realise that the harder I try to \"correct\" the bad day, the worse it gets. So now I just let it be and have a morbid humour about it. *\"Okay so today's the crap day. Gotcha. Of course next I'm gonna stub my toe really hard or trip down the escalator\"*\ud83d\ude0a\n\nAnd then it works itself out and I just focus on tomorrow being better and it invariably is. Let the bad day be itself and chalk it up to a necessary evil.",

They work in teams. there are never any winners - don't feel too bad, the trick is designed specifically to take advantage of naive tourists. You are now no longer naive. $500 is a fairly high price to pay for the lesson, but not when you stretch it out for a lifetime, and tell your children etc!",

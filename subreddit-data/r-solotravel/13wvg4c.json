We live in different continents so chances to get together again are very low, and we both travel a lot, so keep moving all the time doesn't help. We exchanged socials, agreed to keep in touch and visit each other, but in my experience this fades away over time. \n\nThis makes me sad and I'd love to read some good stories to cheer me up a bit!

You only have to keep in mind that they don't always reply straight away (but then again, I don't always do that with people in the same country). If you follow each other on some kind of social media, you can still catch slices of their life, even though you don't necessarily talk that often. A lot of my 'communication' with some friends is sending Instagram posts back and forth without actually talking for days or weeks",

We\u2019ll send a gift every now and again. \n\nLast April we went to Ireland for an extended weekend. I\u2019m from Canada, and he\u2019s still around London, so it was a longer trip for me, but kind of to be expected. We stayed with his cousin in Belfast for part of it, and we had carte blanche with his car as well. Was a hell of a good time. \n\nDefinitely worth the effort to find the one or two who will make your life better going forward. Definitely don\u2019t put up a giant wall like some people seem to be suggesting",

Reminisce during your first conversation but talk about your life afterwards. If you just gush about what a great time you had together during your trip, you'll soon run out of things to talk about; it's during this time that you will figure out whether you can keep the friendship going.\n\nWhen you know it's something worth keeping, you'll find ways.",

There were people who I met in one country while traveling and then (accidentally or planned) I met them in a different country while both of us were traveling again. The reunions sometimes felt awesome, sometimes felt meh, like we lost the connection once we partied our ways. I would say, with many people I keep the connection for about half a year or a year after the trip where we met each other. But out of probably ~300-400 people I added on social media after 6 long backpacking trips (3-6 months each trip) I\u2019m only somewhat in touch on a semi regular basis with maybe 20 people.\n\nPeople travel, then they go back to their real life, their family, friends and work. Then they find partners, get married and have kids and they definitely don\u2019t have time to chat with someone they met for a week in Bali 3 years ago. Heck, at some point people barely have time to talk to their highschool/uni friends who they actually spent years building friendships with!\n\nI think it\u2019s better to keep low expectations about the sort of connection you can build with someone you met while traveling.",

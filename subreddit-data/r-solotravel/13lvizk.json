For that reason, the first time I really let my facial hair grow out was while I was on a trip.",

If I buy too much I can just send it back home by post or something. \n\nThat way I\u2019m not sweating out thick clothes and I can put together some nice party outfits. \n\nAs for accessories, Thailand was great for the \u2018everything 20baht\u2019 stores where i stocked up on necklaces and bracelets. \n\nI usually get by with some shift dresses, sandals, some accessories and a fanny pack. I can pull off the boho chic look with those.\n\nEven though I like traveling as cheap as possible, I like to save for bougie stuff and have some nice clubbing outfits for some rooftop bars.",

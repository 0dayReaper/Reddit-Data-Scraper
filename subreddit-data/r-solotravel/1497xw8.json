Would that be enough?\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nInterests: glaciers, waterfalls, ice caves, maybe some snorkeling, aaalll the nature spots\r  \n\r  \nMost of the itineraries I see online require a rental car to reach all the best spots.\r  \n\r  \nDo you think I will be able to visit the island without a car? Maybe joining group tours?\r  \n\r  \nHas anyone done that and has any advice? I have a driving licence but I do not feel confident on driving alone in a foreign country.\r  \n\r  \nIn addition, should I book a place in Reykjav\u00edk as a base or should I change every few days?\r  \n\r  \nThank you so much!!!",

Based on Reykjavik- did two group tours and then a day in Reykjavik center. But that was after the week with the car and so didn\u2019t feel like I needed to see all the things. What\u2019s your reasoning for not wanting to rent a car? Group trips are nice but can add up and you could rent a van and some camping equipment and combine your costs of accommodation and transport.",

            "comment": "I traveled to Iceland last summer and drove the entire ring road. I HIGHLY recommend renting a car if you can. Driving in Iceland is incredibly easy\u2014 much easier than North America\u2014 they are very strict about their speed limits there, and the roads are very well maintained. You can join group tours but in my opinion it is very worth it to have your own transportation so that you can spend as much time as you like at each location. \n\nIf you\u2019re only interested in the Golden Circle a group trip would probably suffice but if you want to see more of the country, renting a car is 100% the best way to go.",

            "comment": "Iceland is probably one of the easiest places to drive and navigate. If you\u2019re able to drive imo you should rent the car. I dunno if it\u2019s still offered but I got a wireless hotspot device with my rental car and it came in handy for me.\n\nYou can join a tour but their sites will have to align to what to what you want to see and it\u2019ll probably add up to more than what driving will with less freedom to do what you want.\n\nI\u2019d say a week would be long enough to drive the whole country especially if you\u2019re going solo. 6-7 days should be a good amount of time.",

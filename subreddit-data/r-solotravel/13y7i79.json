    "postText": "Hi I am a well traveled 31 year old male but having a bit of anxiety trying to plan Morocco. I know the distances between the cities are quite large so I am trying to plan accordingly. Does anyone or has anyone have experience booking a guided tour with an operator that allows groups?  I have contacted many tour operators and all of them do not offer shared tours. Have about 9 nights in total there, so would love to do a week tour and then spend 2 extra days in Marrakech.",

The groups are capped at 12 people.   \nIf you have people you like to travel with, you can book the trip together and ask to stay together while traveling. Or you can just book the trip for you and you might get paired up with another solo traveler of your same gender for the accommodations. You also have the option of paying a \"single supplement\" fee and that means you'll get your own room at any of the accommodations on the trip that allow for single rooms.   \nThey have trips all over the world doing all kinds of things. Festivals, food tours, hiking tours, sailing tours. Check out their site!   \nwww.intrepidtravel.com",

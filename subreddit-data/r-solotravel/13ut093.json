    "postText": "To preface - I'm 25m and this is my first ever solo adventure - I'm pretty much looking to do a mix of partying, sightseeing but mainly just max relax and chill on beaches and see some cool places. With that in mind I'd love some critiques &amp; reccomendations.  \n\n\nI'm planning on starting day 1 in about 2 weeks (Say 10th June)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot particularly interested in doing heaps of travelling around and stuff, just limiting to visiting a few different places.\n\n\\-My idea is basically to chill the first day at BKK and not do much at all, then just explore the city for 2 days and a bit of partying.\n\n\\-Chiang Mai I'm thinking of just seeing all the cool temples and cultural stuff and just chilling, wondering if 3 days is a bit too much? Maybe an extra day in BKK and 1 less in Chiang Mai? Thoughts?\n\n\\-Phuket seems pretty cool, would think 2 days would be pretty much perfect to see and experience the main attractions there and chill out?\n\n\\-I pretty much lump Krabi and Ko Phi Phi together as just massive kick back on the beaches and see the cool nature stuff for a couple of days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 1: Arrive in Bangkok\n\nDay 2: Bangkok\n\nDay 3: Bangkok\n\nDay 4: Chiang Mai\n\nDay 5: Chiang Mai\n\nDay 6: Chiang Mai\n\nDay 7: Phuket\n\nDay 8: Phuket\n\nDay 9: Krabi\n\nDay 10: Krabi\n\nDay 11: Ko Phi Phi\n\nDay 12: Ko Phi Phi\n\nDay 13: Head back to Phuket\n\nDay 14: Head back to Bangkok and head home\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks!",

Go to Bangkok and then head south to the islands. \n\nChiang Mai is good but it\u2019s not worth the trek given your limited time. Bangkok has amazing temples and loads of cultural stuff.",

I'd suggest Phuket over the islands but I've only been to  Ko Tao, the smallest.  \n\nThe boat to these Atlantic islands is time consuming so definitely fly. Each flight days seems like a full day in Thailand too since Thai Air / Air Asia is rather relaxed with its booking schedule (according to their terms they can change your flight up to 24 hours and no refund).  So going to just three destinations eats up 3 days of travel plus your arrival departure days, yielding about 9 full days out of a 14 day trip.\n\nIf you go to Phuket you can easily bounce around that area by taxis staying in a few different towns/resorts.\n\nWhen looking at resorts, each will show you wonderful beach photos but look on google earth and see what it really looks like.  A lot of hotel photos are grossly misleading (e.g. beach is on the other side of a highway).",

I am also familiar with sign language.\n\n  \nI'm in desperate need of a vacation so I am thinking of travelling to Europe for two weeks. But I'm just worried about not being able to hear things. For example, what if I lose my phone and cannot talk/hear on the phone (it's a fact, I cannot hear well on the phone)? Or what if there's a fire alarm in a hotel and I cannot hear it?\n\n  \nIf you have travelled to Europe alone before, please do share your tips!",

It\u2019s a great way to start out and meet new people plus there\u2019s the added safety net of having a tour guide and other group members watching your back. There might even be tours that specifically cater to deaf/sign language. It\u2019s also worthwhile checking in with resources in the deaf community to see what travel advice they have too",

Most menus have an English version and half the time I point because I don\u2019t want to butcher the pronunciation. \n\nMost fire alarms also have lights in hotels. You could also mention it to your hostel mates to wake you in an emergency. However I think the odds of this are low. But I get the worry. \n\nAs far as your phone concerns go. I would just make sure you know your passwords to your email so you can login and get info needed there if your phone gets lost. You could also pack a second tech device if you have one? Like an iPad would allow you to FaceTime someone at home to help you out in a real pinch.",

I accidentally killed a rechargeable battery of mine so that left me with one left until I had a battery shipped over from America. \n\nOtherwise you\u2019ll be fine. If you are having trouble hearing someone, just use primitive sign language indicating you can\u2019t hear and talk to them via google translate.

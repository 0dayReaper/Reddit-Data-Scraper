    "postText": "I\u2019m currently in Coron in the Philippines. I was planning on taking the ferry to El Nido a few days ago, but due to the terrible weather here the ferry keeps getting cancelled and I\u2019m somewhat stuck in Coron. The next ferry is scheduled for June 3, but I have a flight out of Puerto Princesa the next day so if I take that ferry I wouldn\u2019t have any time in El Nido.\n\nSo my choices are:\n\n1) Cut my losses and fly straight from Coron to Cebu. I have a flight out of Cebu on the 7th anyway. I\u2019d go to Moalboal to see the Sardine Run and do Canyoneering in Kawasan falls, which I was really excited for. \n2) Go to El Nido. Since I\u2019d be delayed by so much, if I go to El Nido I\u2019ll have to fly to Cebu after and go straight to my flight out of the country. Therefore, I wouldn\u2019t be able to see any of the canyoneering or snorkeling on Cebu island. Since I\u2019ve been in Coron for a few days, I feel like a lot of the sights around El Nido are pretty similar, and the weather here seems pretty bad (raining all day almost every day).\n\nWhich do you think would be better for my last few days in the Philippines? I\u2019m a pretty active person, not a huge fan of just chilling on the beach. I was planning on doing both but due to the weather have to choose one place and I\u2019m having a hard time making a decision.",

So I personally like El Nido better, in my bias opinion. \n\nThat said, I don\u2019t think the time crunch would be as enjoyable with going to El Nido. Lastly, it sounds like you really want to go to Cebu more than El Nido, so go to Cebu!",

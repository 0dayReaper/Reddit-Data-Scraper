Visiting the valley of the kings from luxor could be done with a private driver but it'll be more expensive. I still have the number of an excellent and cheap group tour I took there if you want, the explanations were excellent.",

You won\u2019t have any trouble getting in on one. You do have to schedule it ahead of time, because they\u2019ll need your passport info since the road has rules for tourists and there\u2019s a number of military checkpoints. \n\nIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s just the road that leads down to Sudan so it\u2019s pretty controlled. They used to only allow tourists in a huge convoy of buses, but the rules have relaxed since then. There are public buses, but I don\u2019t believe tourists are allowed on them.\n\nThere\u2019s tour buses, tour vans, whatever. Or you can hire a car to take you, which is what I did. I used a company called Aswan Individual, I think they just have a number of drivers they use. I believe the cost was $100 for the day, which was worth it to me because I was able to arrange it to get there when all the tour groups were leaving \u2014 meaning it was basically empty. \n\nI know you said you don\u2019t want a \u201cday trip,\u201d but there\u2019s no other way to do Abu Simbel. And it would be a shame to be in Aswan and not go. Also, don\u2019t miss Philae when you\u2019re in Aswan, it\u2019s amazing \u2014 as is the light show at night. \n\nRegarding Luxor, both Luxor Temple and Karnak are on the East Bank. You can take cabs or just walk. \n\nMost of the stuff you want to see is on the West Bank. If you aren\u2019t with an organized tour group, the best way to do this is to take the public ferry across the Nile, and get a cab on the other side. \n\nJust negotiate a price, the driver will take you where you want to go and wait for you. This is very common and they\u2019re used to it. I would not recommend trying to do this any other way, like taking a cab to the Valley of the Kings and hoping to grab a different one when you\u2019re done. \n\nI don\u2019t remember what I paid, I think it was about $30 for six hours. \n\nI would also recommend not negotiating to get a cab from the East Bank. They have to drive a far distance to get to the bridge, which wastes a lot of time. The ferry is cheap and fast.",

I was the only female in my car\u2026so was a bit nervous, but all was fine (I did try to hide under my very pink hoodie\u2026but that probably didn\u2019t help (lol).\nThen had my hotel in Luxor book me a cruise to Aswan and a private car to Abu Simbel. It all worked great.\n\nAs a tip, book through cheap accommodation as the pricey resorts will charge more to book for you.\n\nEnjoy Egypt. It\u2019s awesome! And wear headphones to avoid all the hasslers.",

Two days in a row. For more remote sites along the Nile I took a train and thea taxi to the specific sight. When I was there (2019), it was not allowed for foreigners to use intercity minubuses in Luxor region.  \n\n\nAswan is quite compact to walk and it's easy to catch a ferry to the island. Getting to the dam is a bit tricky as you need to find a right minibus. Ask a local. Same with the transport to Abu Simbel.",

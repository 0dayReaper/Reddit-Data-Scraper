    "postText": "I encountered my first begpacker today. I was sitting in a park at night in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, talking to my friend on FaceTime. A descheveled looking white guy approaches me with a perfect American accent and asks if I can spare any change so he can buy dinner. It took a minute for my brain to register I'm in Vietnam and this isn't a normal panhandler. I tell him no and I'm on a call, and he starts getting extremely rude with me, saying that it's only a few dollars. I then try to go back to my call and he sits down beside me saying he'll wait till I'm done. At this point I had to yell at him to fuck off, and luckily I'm a big dude so he did. \n\nHonestly I'm so disgusted. I've heard about this but never seen it in person. Welfare in the US/Canada pays more than the average wage in this country. If you can't afford a meal in Vietnam, call the embassy and go the fuck home.",

I really hate the hero-worship of \u201coh, wow, you acted poor, you must be a saint!\u201d \n\nThe book Black Like Me comes close to this problematic territory (of faking an experience to become an expert on that which one cannot be an expert on) but I think he had a better grasp of his limitations and responsibilities within the context.

Her sister suffers from mental illness and is unhoused. My friend says a couple of times a year her family gets calls from people who tracked them down to reunite them with the family member...let them know where she was, etc.  They would have to explain how many years they had spent putting her in various treatment facilities and the countless times she had left against medical advice to return to the streets unmedicated.  Seems so painful to have to go through this repeatedly and feel either helpless or heartless or a combination of both. Gave me a different perspective.",

The sense of entitlement it takes to travel to a place where locals earn a fraction of what people do in your home country, and where your week's salary may be a year of theirs -- and then expecting them to donate money to you to keep you afloat? Yeah, nope.\n\nI will say this: There are occasionally extenuating circumstances that could make for exceptions. For instance, I travelled to India in 2016 at the very beginning of the demonetization crisis. For the first few weeks, only Indian citizens with bank accounts had any kind of means to exchange old money to new, and foreigners also couldn't sign up for mobile payments and other alternatives without an Indian ID and bank account. I met quite a few travellers and backpackers who had to ask for assistance during that time, not because they couldn't afford to pay their own way, but simply because they couldn't get their hands on cash to actually pay for anything (especially while the credit &amp; debit systems were down). In an extreme circumstance like this, yes, it's understandable, temporarily.\n\nOtherwise, though? Nope nope nope. Nobody's saying you have to travel on a luxury budget. But you have to be able to afford your own survival needs before picking up and travelling somewhere else. Especially somewhere where you have a fair amount more financial privilege than the local people do.",

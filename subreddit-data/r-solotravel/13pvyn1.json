I\u2019m American but ethnically Chinese, and in 2 days, a huge group of children have screamed \u201cChing Chong\u201d at me, got yelled \u201csuck a penis ch*nk\u201d, \u201cChina! China!!\u201d, \u201cnihao\u201d. All this screaming has really turned me off from traveling further into the Balkans. Are there any countries in the region that have less racism against Asians?",

I'm black for the record.\n\nIn Europe, and in Turkey, she got way more crap than I ever did. Lots of people pulling their eyes back (Italy and France especially), nihaos all day, making animal eating comments if we were admiring anyone's pet on the street (not much, but more than once).\n\nI was seriously surprised as I got away with being called Obama, asked if I was or knew rappers, or people wanting to see black genitalia.\n\nTo be very fair, she was much more of a door opener for us, and more people fawned over than anything, but if there were racist moment awards in Europe, she had me beat.",

Most of them were solo young men from North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan, unfortunately some being ex-convicts and people fleeing from justice that caused some issues such as shoplifting, breaking into weekend houses in rural areas and fighting between each other.\n\n There are indeed legitimate people among these groups and Bosnians recognized this, being friendly and handing out lots of clothes, money and resources for their travels, since a lot of Bosnians themselves were refugees. You can find quite a few positive experiences as told by them.\n\nUnfortunately the part of their groups that was causing trouble did get really bad press, as Bosnia is a country that isn't used to street crime and property theft. That might be a reason that some people are cautious and appear mildly racist, although you'll see the Balkan countries quite low on racism indexes, with nationalism being predominant.\n\nThe migrant numbers are negligible compared to what they used to be, as many either got deported to be handled by local authorities or managed to get to Western Europe via smugglers.\n\nWe do see Pakistan as a friend and someone that helped us during the war so we'd never discriminate anyone looking South Asian plainly on that.",

Bigger cities were better than small towns and rural regions. Looking back, for me the positives and kind people outweighed the negative experiences I had throughout my trip, but I did have plenty sad, exhausted, scared and angry moments because of this, and sometimes regretted my choice of going there so I think I understand at least some part of your frustration.

                            "comment": "I had some of my best and worst experiences in Albania, so don't let just the bad experiences stop you from going. It's absolutely beautiful and I met so many nice and hositable people. I also cycled through the country (N-&gt;S, mostly close-ish to the coast), and that meant I saw a lot of \"inbetween\" places that you wouldn't necessarily go to as a tourist, so my experience might be different than if you go see the highlights and travel by car/public transport. Some of these \"inbetween\"places were amazing and some less so. \n\nWorst experiences included 2 separate occasions of being followed by guys for multiple kilometers while getting yelled at, 1 of which tried to block the road with his car and threatened me to go with him, also lots of guys catcalling or yelling sexist slurs at me. More mild was lots of guys commenting about: how I should be married by now (I was 20) and where my partner was, how other guys would probably rape me, how they would not be able to restrain themselves and that I was not safe looking like I did, especially with my blonde hair (lots of sexual weirdness about being blonde-ish). \n\nA few of these more serious occasions felt threatening, but I never felt like I could not extract myself from them. I was personally also willing to adapt to ignorance/different norms and to make my trip safer at the cost of some experiences, to be able to experience different things and see more places, but this is a personal decision and it's also very valid to not want to do that.   \nFor example, I always left very early in the morning to avoid the heat and never have to worry about looking for a place to stay after dark. I always tried having an idea where I would sleep that evening before leaving in the morning and in that way was less free I think than some other (male) long-distance cyclists. When camping I made sure to ask young women or families if they knew a good spot to pitch, never men alone. In most places I did not go outside/out of my tent after dark. I carried a fake wallet (that I was very happy to have on one occasion), and a fake wedding ring (that I only wore in specific sketchy situations) and photo of me and a close guy friend in the fake wallet. If I felt unsafe I sometimes told guys I was meeting up with him in the next big-ish city on my trip and made up bullshit about our relationship. I'm bi and also never mentioned dating women or anything to do queerness outside of touristy hostel situations. I was careful, but did just go anywhere I wanted. If I were a woman of colour, I probably would have felt a need to be slightly more careful, and perhaps avoid some very remote/rural areas. I am on the careful side though (as this comment shows), so you might also be comfortable taking more risks than me. It's very personal.\n\nTo be honest, after a while I felt plenty safe enough, but the thing that made me a bit sad was to think of so many guys not considering a person of another gender a worthy partner in conversation or fully independent human being, and to think of the fact that I could choose to visit and enjoy the beauty of the place despite this and then leave when I wanted to, but that so many women and young people in general are essentially stuck (especially in non-EU countries like Albania) and have no choice in the matter. Overall I loved visiting the Balkans and I had so many amazing experiences and interactions. Definitely go, it's amazing, but do what you need to do to feel safe and enjoy your trip. I doubt you'll have any problems in the bigger cities and any tourist destinations as long as you keep your head on your shoulders. Sorry for the long reply and anyone in this situation feel free to message me :)",

I remember a racist incident I encountered as kid that still jars me now.\n\n\nThis was in the 90s when racial tensions were high (riots, a couple of very notable racist incidents).  I was playing basketball with a bunch of friends at an open court in an area known to be very white (if you\u2019re from NYC you can probably narrow it down to which areas).  We were all black, Caribbean, and south Asian.  The entire court was full with kids playing ball in different courts.  It was around dusk time and the cops came by.  They beelined straight to us and told us we had leave.  We had no idea why.  It wasn\u2019t dark, and the park was still open.  My brother, who was the oldest person there out of our group (and studying pre med in a good college at the time) spoke to the cops and was like it\u2019s not dark yet, the gates were open, and we are allowed to play.  The cops said there were noise complaints about people playing ball and we had to go.  So we start packing up and leaving.  Then we realize the cops are only asking us to leave.  We look around, every other group playing in the court was white.  We were the only group that wasn\u2019t white.  We\u2019re like what about the people in park to the cops? The cops straight up says \u201cdon\u2019t worry about them, you guys have to go\u201d.  We were all dumbstruck.  My brother is just like, come on guys let\u2019s go. We all leave.  And I remember him just telling us knowing what we all knew, that is wasn\u2019t worth it.  And he was right.  There was no point arguing or trying fight getting kicked out.  \n\n\nThat shit was so jarring.  We were all good smart kids.  None of us were troublemakers and caused any problems.  The only reason, the only reason,  the cops harassed and told us to leave was because of our skin color.  Something we can\u2019t control. I can study hard and do well in school if I wasn\u2019t happy about my grades and didn\u2019t get into a college I wanted, I could hit the gym and work out and get more fit if I wasn\u2019t happy about my fitness.  But here was something I couldn\u2019t control or couldn\u2019t change.  And it\u2019s because of that I wasn\u2019t allowed to play in this park.  \n\n\nIt was decades ago at this point, but it affects you.  Even as a kid.  And this was the 90s.  Imagine a kid growing up in the 50s or 60s when racism was more blatant and accepted?  Shit changes you.",

I found most people to be very welcoming (although some of the men were kinda creepy, being \"exotic\" excited them :P )  I read some comments about being treated the worst in Serbia and that shocked me because people were very welcoming, gave me free souvenirs, etc. The only negative I have from Serbia was being scammed by a taxi driver.\n\nI'm very sorry that you are having a negative experience. I went to Germany, Turkiye, Albania, Romania,  Kosovo and Greece last September &amp; October and really enjoyed my trip. I was ok in all of the countries (although the cat calling in Romania was intense but I'm exotic, so I guess that excited the men). I think you'll be ok in Montenegro, Albania and Croatia.

Northern Louisiana is arguably the most \u201cracist\u201d part of Louisiana. It\u2019s probably due to the fact many years ago, Ku Klux Klan members migrated to northern parishes that are closer to Arkansas; so, cities such as Monroe, Shreveport, Bossier City and Alexandria etc are considered the racist parts by locals. North and South are like night and day- accents, customs, etc are very diverse. Insofar as tourism, people typically go to New Orleans, which is probably the most liberal part of Louisiana. In regards to racism in the south, Louisiana is probably the least racist of all the southern States. I was born and raised in New Orleans, but I\u2019ve lived in Texas and Georgia and went to college in Alabama. Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia are very old-fashioned and traditional, and Mississippi is arguably the most racist state in the Union. I would stay away from Mississippi altogether because there isn\u2019t much to see there anyway.  If it were me, I\u2019d pass on Mississippi and Alabama for sure. But New Orleans is definitely a great place to go sightseeing and visit historical landmarks. But it\u2019s honestly more dangerous than other cities, being the murder-per capita of the U.S. time and time again. If you do visit, valet with your hotel to prevent car burglary, which has increased exponentially in the past few years, and don\u2019t go anywhere after dark because the changes of getting robbed increases at night even in high traffic tourist areas.",

It\u2019s stiflingly strict and nitpicky b/c no one is perfect &amp; literally anything can be offensive to someone.\n\nOfc there were a couple of times in Europe when someone said \u201cni hao\u201d to me, but those were random young trolls, and rare. I wasn\u2019t insulted b/c idgaf about randos\u2019 opinions. Then there were times I was told I said something dumb &amp; I laughed b/c it was amusing for someone not to mince words like that.\n\nAnd there could be more sensitivity in terms of accessibility, although I get that it\u2019s difficult to jive those measures with so many historical structures and streets.

Have you seen the racists who have been getting go fund me money for their legal troubles after being extremely racist and getting caught on tape?\n\nI just want to be clear here that the likelihood of someone experiencing overtly aggressive racism is probably low especially if you\u2019re traveling and you\u2019re temporarily there. But racism presents itself in many forms and it can be subtle. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth acknowledging. \n\nI\u2019m just saying as someone who lives in the United States and has lived in the rural area and the city, that racism is alive and well. And that it\u2019s a silly statement to say that the country with an incredibly held racist institution isn\u2019t racist and that it\u2019s comfortable here. And I say this as an Asian American. \n\nA lot of shit goes down here and what you see online is about 5% of it. A lot of what OP described is just what kids in school can receive daily. And just because we\u2019re on a solo travel sub doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t acknowledge that that shit happens. \n\nBut idk why I\u2019m getting downvoted for pointing that out. What happens when someone says something racist isn\u2019t that they\u2019re horrified about saying it. They\u2019re more horrified that someone would possibly call them racist for saying racist things and then they act like the victim and then they get the benefit of the doubt. \n\nBut to bring it back to travel, OP experienced something shitty and didn\u2019t enjoy being placed in that situation. But everyone one here is trying to downplay it and act like it\u2019s an outlier and it\u2019s not common. But that shit happens and instead of downplaying it, it should be met with more empathy for the person who had to experience that than empathy for the kids doing the racist shit. But alas, I guess that might be too much to ask for.",

It just feels like you\u2019re weaponizing your experience and giving others a reason to feel like what I\u2019m saying isn\u2019t happening when it is.

I sort of just expect racism there and don\u2019t really want to visit a place where I\u2019m genuinely unwanted. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s different in some cities and all but I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not at the top of my list of regions to visit. \n\nThat said, I do love travel and would love to go there eventually. But it\u2019s less urgent than other regions cus I just feel like it\u2019ll be awash with dirty looks and rudeness.",

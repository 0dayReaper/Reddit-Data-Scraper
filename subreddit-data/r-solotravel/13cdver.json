    "postText": "This is my first solo-travel trip and I\u2019d like some advice from people who deals with the same situations. \n\nSo for about a week I\u2019m going to London. But I have prescriptions medication here in the US. I have Albuterol, Flovent, an EpiPen and Escitalopram. When I researched, it said to make sure the medications are in the original packaging and it is so in my carry-on. So to those that share my same predicament is that all that needs to be done?\n\nThank you so much for your help.",

None of those are controlled drugs here by the looks of it, you can take it in fine, just go down green channel if you have nothing else to declare.\n\nAs you've said, it's best to carry them in original packaging, put them in carry-on (generally a good idea anyway, luggage doesnt always arrive with you and whilst it will be possible to get them here, its something you dont want to do unless you have to). If you've particularly worried, take a copy of the script or a letter from your GP confirming why you are taking it. I doubt you will be stopped going through customs with it, but if you are, just say you are taking it for this condition, you have a prescription.",

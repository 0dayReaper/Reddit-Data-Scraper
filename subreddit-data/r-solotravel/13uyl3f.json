    "postText": "So I was in Spain today. I'm a solo 29 yr old man who is very white. I went to the beach and was worried about my back getting burnt. I went on reddit to see what people had to say about asking strangers for help. Many threads were very against it, should buy a self applicator stick etc lol.\n\nI was worried and didn't have a self applicator. My strategy was to approach a couple so as not to come off as creepy, and actually to apply sunscreen everywhere, except my upper and middle back where I can't reach, beside them. Then I just went up and super politely was like hey I'm super white very sorry for the inconvenience but can you help just with the upper middle back I can't reach?\n\nThey laughed at me being overly apologetic and were like no problem at all and the guy helped me out. \n\nIMO better to ask a couple so they feel more secure and it doesn't seem predatory.  Be super polite and apologetic basically, and only ask for the exact part of your back you can't reach. \n\nJust figured I would share, since other posts I saw seemed to think this was impossibly rude lol",

I think it's very considerate of him to think so much about this - way too many foreigners going somewhere and not thinking about what might be appropriate and what might be inappropriate for SHIT. I can also see how he was nervous about this since it totally can come off as predatory. \"Hey, mind putting some lotion on me? ;) ;) ;)\" - as a woman, if I got asked that while alone on the beach, I'd feel like I was being hit on, sleazily. I don't think it's fair to heckle him for going on reddit for some advice on this.",

A common courtesy is getting something off a high shelf or holding the door open for someone. Rubbing a stranger AND ending up with sticky sunscreen on my hands, that's a petty big ask in my book.  People need to work on their flexibility tbh, how y'all can't reach your own backs is a mystery to me (unless you have an injury, disability, missing arm, etc.) Anyways, just my 2 cents, it is unfair and entitled to expect people to be ok with touching/rubbing you. Also, some people's backs are kind of gross to the touch -- Imagine getting flakes of skin, body oil, or random hairs on your hands and then you want to eat your pringles or whatever. Nope x 1000.",

It is no indication of the efficacy of the sunscreen. \n\nSecond, Consumer Reports just did a breakdown of the best sunscreens (May 2023) and how well they blocked UVA and UVB. Of the top 5 they recommend, 2 were sprays. \n\nYes, you do need to be more careful with sprays. As CR stated in its review: \n\n*It\u2019s easier to make sure you\u2019re getting adequate coverage with a lotion than with a spray because you can see how much you\u2019re using. And proper spray application isn\u2019t always easy, especially when it\u2019s windy. Oftentimes you end up protecting the air more than your skin.*\n\nLink to CR [article](https://www.consumerreports.org/health/sunscreens/best-sunscreens-of-the-year-a7763432372/)",

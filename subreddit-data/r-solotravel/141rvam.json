    "postText": "I\u2019m planning a solo trip to Mexico. I\u2019ll be there for 30 days flying into CDMX and out of Cancun. \n\nI\u2019ve thought about places I\u2019d like to explore but I would also really like advice from you guys as to which places to go to. \n\nI want to also plan as I go but I\u2019ve thought about an itinerary that looks like this : \n\nCDMX - 5 nights \nOaxaca - 4 nights \nPuerto Escondido - 4 nights \nChiapas - 4 nights \nYucat\u00e1n peninsula for 8 days and last 4 nights in Isla Mujeres \n\nWhere should I definitely go in the Yucat\u00e1n and where should I skip going? \n\nAlso I was thinking of going to Guatemala for some days - would that be stressful or very doable? - what should I skip / take fewer days in case of me going to Guatemala? \n\nThanks \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\udc4f\n\nEdit: \nI\u2019m interested in culture, museums, hiking, adventure sports and beautiful sights. \nTraveling on a backpackers budget and therefore traveling by bus.",

            "comment": "The start looks good. Maybe one less night in Oaxaca.\n\nPE is a surfer town. Huge waves, long, long beautiful beach. \n\nChiapas is a state, and it's the real deal Mexico. It's rough around the edges, and definitely worth more time.\n\nChiapas is on the border with Guatemala, and I would strongly suggest you go across and see it. Time much better spent than in Cancun. \n\nI've been to 14 Mexican states, and Yucat\u00e1n and Quintana Roo are among my least favourite. Cancun is ultra American, and unless you are planning on an all-inclusive, very restricted beach access. You know you are in trouble when you see signs saying, \"Mexican Food Sold Here\"! \n\nIsla Mujeres is not much. I'd say two/three nights max. It's only a 30+/-min boat ride from Cancun, and you can do it as a day trip.\n\nCDMX is amazing! Lots to do and see. You may want to consider another night there. \n\nLove travelling in Mexico.\n\nHave a grea trip!\n\nproperfckr",

                            "comment": "San Cristobal is like a smaller version of Oaxaca but with less good food. I disagree with poster above on reducing time there - I and spent 6 weeks in Oaxaca and never got bored. There is so much architecture, culture, food. There\u2019s always some sort of celebration going on in the streets. The street art is beautiful. The mezcal bars are really nice, and you can find unique experiences like operas pretty easily. \n\nSan Cristobal is nice though, particularly if you like nature excursions. Sometimes they have events and festivals in the mountains. It\u2019s low key very fashionable in the city so if you\u2019re into local designer clothes, come with space in your bags. If you plan to do any work at all, Co404 is a great coworking hostel where people actually work instead of party. It\u2019s beautiful as well.",

No chairs at all, only hundreds of candles all over the floor; fresh flowers everywhere, people sacrificing chickens, singing incantations, drinking potions. whole families there with offerings. \n\nYou can find a small, cheap tour in San Cristobal, or just hire a taxi to take you there. Not to be missed!\n\nhttps://en.travelbymexico.com/sancristobal/places-to-visit/?nom=kscrjuanchamula",

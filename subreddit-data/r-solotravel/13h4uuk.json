    "postText": "Fairly experienced solo traveller, making my way through Japan for the first time. Language barrier and loneliness aside, one challenge I didn't expect was being so underprepared in organising activities. So far I've managed to miss out on an onsen trip (due to needing to advance book the transport) and the Noodle Factory Cup Experience due to my lack of awareness in knowing how to book stuff. I feel like I scour the website before travelling but I'm always one link away from realising they have an online booking process.\n\nI know I should be prepared and have thought about buying tickets in advance the moment I knew I would be going but I spend so much time planning next travel days, where to eat that I feel like I'm already stretched on planning. \n\nI never felt this way when I travelled through Europe.\n\nDoes anyone else have similar stories of planning burnout? I feel like I ruin things for myself and make the wrong call about what I do!",

You could relatively easily pick up and go to a different city on the Shinkansen, eat thousands of different foods, go out to some live music, etc.\n\nIf you missed out on an Onsen trip, no big deal, there are tons of others you can still go to and try out. \n\nIf you look on the bright side, maybe missing out on one thing because of a \u201cwrong call\u201d will lead you to some fun other thing. I imagine that\u2019s actually one of the potential positives of solo travel  - you are always the master of your plan, so it\u2019s okay if you change it.\n\nOn a side note, I think you\u2019re blaming yourself for things and underplaying the language barrier.

After searching around for a while, I luckily found some security guards in a security tent. (They were listening to the radio, which I heard) They were very surprised to see me. There was quite a language barrier, but I used hand gestures to relay the point that I wanted to leave. It all worked out in the end, and I now have a travel adventure story from that trip.",

The language barrier was challenging but Japan was all very organised and easy to arrange/pre-book things. Things like where to eat maybe you can forgo detailed planning and just make sure you have options and decide on the day. Spend more time to secure/plan your day around things that are must dos and must sees, and be flexible with the rest. Hope your trip improves.",

The Yamanote line, however is arguably the best Tokyo subway line. It also allows you to use most Shinkansen and the Narita Express from the airport. Book your Shinkansen seat at the airport free with the JR pass snd make sure you get a seat on the right hand side leaving Tokyo for Kyoto. That way you get a great view of Mount Fuji. Coming back you obviously then need to book a seat on the left hand side \ud83d\ude0aYou can buy the JR pass before you leave home, giving plenty of time to receive it before travel. You then activate it in Japan, the best place being at Narita airport in order to use the Narita Express. Ask at the airport where to activate the pass snd anyone will show you.\n\nEdit:\nAs stated below, The Yamanote is the main JR loop line in Tokyo, but there are other suburban JR lines to use, as stated in the JR website.",

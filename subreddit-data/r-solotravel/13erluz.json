    "postText": "Just posting this to anyone waiting till the last minute to apply for their Working Holiday Visa as an American.\n\nI'm currently 30 In California time, but about 2 hours into being 31 on Canberra time. You need to be 18-30 (including 30) I wasn't aware that the DOB is based on Australia time. In hindsight it should be obvious. Tried to apply earlier this week but the immigration website was acting finicky. \n\nI thought today was the last day I could apply but that window has already passed apparently. Don't wait!\n\nTL;DR. Turn 31 on May 12th.\n\nAt the time of posting it's May 11th in the U.S.\n\n2:00 a.m. on May 12th in Australia rendering me ineligble.I do hold a Working Holiday Visa in New Zealand and plan to leave in a few days so at least there's that!",

So loud and obnoxious that I went down to the desk to see if there were any beds open in an all girl dorm. No dice. Oh well, I have earplugs so at least that is something.\n\nAnother dude comes back to the room and hears the sleeping lawnmower. He is displeased. He begins knocking on the guys bunk, speaking loudly and I think he finally woke him by poking/physically touching him. \n\nWhile I am thankful for the snoring to have ceased, it is absolutely buck wild to me that this dude felt comfortable waking that guy up. Maybe its because I'm a woman and from the US, but I would never dream of touching a sleeping stranger, and imagine I would freak out if a stranger had pulled back the curtain of my bunk to wake me. \n\nWhich makes me wonder; what is the general etiquette for snoring roommates in hostels? Has someone ever woken you up for snoring or the other way around?",

He never did get up for whatever he was supposed to get up for. And I told myself I should probably never stay in a dorm again...",

Once it rang for 20 min until somebody else snoozed it, but then it went off again after a bit. This time around I walked to the guys bunk, and tried to wake him up, but he wouldn\u2019t move an inch. Turns out his phone was even in his hand vibrating and all that shit, so it was super loud. I honestly could not even understand how he wouldn\u2019t wake up. I just took his phone from his hand and turned it off. Didn\u2019t want it to go off again. Not sure if the guy missed a plane or anything, but it was beyond ridiculous.",

And they always seem to be the people that never hear them.\n\nMy alarms are now usually just the vibrating on my phone and watch. But when I do have to really get up, I'll set it properly. But even then I'm often awake before the alarm, or catch it on the first ring.\n\nFor snoring in dorms, you just have to deal with it and accept it. People can't exactly help it, so waking someone up isn't going to solve your problem really.\n\nIf people know it's terrible then they should at least try and warn people or give them earplugs as a way to apologize in advance.",

We literally cannot control it and often times aren't even aware. She'd be in the bedroom and warch videos without headphones and have people over till 2am, talk on the phone all night, etc when we had a living room she could be in. I never did shit to her and would just stay out of the room until my roommate fell asleep, and set my alarm to wake up before her. She eventually got her dad to pay for her own apartment on the upper east side of Manhattan and moved out mid year lol.",

            "comment": "During college, I stayed at a hostel in Switzerland. I met a great group of really fun Australians. We got along so well that I fully expected I'd be joining their group the next morning.\n \nThat night, however, I didn't get a wink of sleep. Someone in our large room (it slept perhaps a dozen) was snoring like a jackhammer. \n\nThis wasn't just loud snoring. It sounded like it was being played through speakers at two or three times human volume.  \n\nI finally got out of my bunk to wake (or possibly smother) the culprit.\n\nIt was too dark to see, but I assumed it would be easy to locate the source. \n\nIt wasn't. There was something \\*very\\* peculiar about the acoustics of the room. I walked the room several times, but couldn't figure out who was snoring.\n\nStranger yet, the snoring \\*seemed\\* to be coming exactly from the end of MY EMPTY BUNK. It was louder there than anywhere else in the room -- by a wide margin.  \n\nI couldn't make sense of it. I was just too tired and too confused. So I got back in my bunk and tried my best to get some sleep, with little luck.  \n \nI even sat up several times during the night. The incessant snoring \\*seemed\\* to be loudest about a foot above my shins. It was all \\*very\\* strange.\n\nThe next morning I saw the Australians at breakfast. They looked like they hadn't slept any better than I did. \n\n\"That was the loudest snoring I've ever heard in my life\" one of the Australians said with marked irritation.  \n\n\"Right!? Any idea who it was?\" I asked.  \n\n\"It was you mate.\"  \n\nWait, what? I was shocked, but understood the confusion. I tried to explain. \"No, it wasn't me. I was awake the whole night too. I tried to find out who...\"  \n\n\"It was you, mate.\"  \n\"No, really, it...\"  \n\"It was you, mate.\" They then turned away and gave me the cold shoulder.  \n\nThere was no point in arguing. My \"explanation\" didn't make any sense to me either. Who knows, maybe I had fallen asleep and was also snoring loudly at some point? \n\nSo I traveled on my own for a few days.  \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  \nEpilogue.  \n\nA few days later I met up with a hilarious Englishman and traveled around with him for about a week.  \n\nThe English guy had been traveling with a larger group, but accidentally got separated from them. His group had planned to head to Italy. We decided to head up to Prague, so it worked out nicely.\n\nWe stayed on the outskirts of Prague, ate like kings for less than a dollar, and rented a nice college dorm room for a few bucks a night. It was great.\n\nI was, however, still a bit worried about snoring. The Englishman hadn't complained, but maybe he was just being polite?\n\nAnyway, on our 2nd day in Prague, on a crowded boulevard, there was an eruption of cheers and shouts directed at us.  \n\nIt was the Australians!  \n\nWhy were they so happy to see me? Oh! They weren't. They knew the English guy. \n\nApparently, this was the group he had been traveling with before we met up. They were thrilled to see him again, and he was thrilled to see them.  \n\nThe Australians all gave me awkward glances. I presumed they were still mad at me, so I left after a few awkward hellos.\n\nLater that night, I met up with the English guy. I assumed he was going to rejoin the Australians and that we would part ways.  \n\n\"Oh no! They're great\" he said. \"But I won't be re-joining them. Rob's the loudest snorer on the planet.\"  \n\nWhat?!\n\nApparently the Englishman had a similar experience with the Australians: there was a loud snorer in the hostel and Rob blamed a random traveler. \n\nWhen he was catching up with the group at the cafe in Prague, the Englishman learned that the rest of the group had finally found Rob out. Rob was the loud snorer. And Rob had been covering for himself by blaming random strangers for his snoring.  \n\nApparently the awkward looks I was getting were looks of embarrassment.\n\nIt still doesn't explain the really creepy and odd acoustics of that particular hostel. But it was nice to have a little vindication, if not an actual apology.",

I very nearly woke someone else up to show them, just to make sure I wasn't imagining it.\n\nI will add that the snoring \\*also\\* sounded like it was coming from two other parts of the room. But neither of those locations were coming from any of the bunks. Rather the locations of those sounds seemed to be floating in air near a wall and cabinets. I assumed it was the sound bouncing off the walls? I don't really know. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\\* Cameron Hewitt, a travel writer for Rick Steves, had a similar story about weird acoustics in a hotel along the Croatian coast (Split, I think). \n\nHewitt was woken up in the middle of the night by very loud, strange noises in his room. When he mentioned them to the hotelier the next day, the hotelier was puzzled. There was no work being done in the hotel, especially not late at night.\n\nWhen it happened again the next night, the hotelier called in relatives to help get to the bottom of it. They listened to the hotel's various pipes, nothing. They walked up and down the street, around the block and didn't see or hear anything unusual. The mystery deepened.\n\nThey continued to make inquiries the next day and eventually learned that work was being done in the basement of a building four or five doors down. Apparently there was some inexplicable acoustic link that conveyed the sound from their basement to Hewitt's upstairs room, several doors down.",

I think that makes it summer 1990. \n\nThe guy who was overseeing our dorm was famous for being the youngest person arrested in the demonstrations the year before.\n\nIn Prague proper you could get a \u2018hot dog\u2019 and a beer for about 50 cents. In Vienna the same order cost about $2-3.\n\nOutside of Prague, prices were even cheaper. We went to a small market and I loaded up a fairly sumptuous breakfast. Don\u2019t recall everything, but cold cuts, cheese, yogurt, a beverage, fruit, a pastry, etc. At the cashier, I just held out my hand with the loose cash I had , hoping it would be enough. \n\nShe removed the bills, which I was expecting, picked at the loose change, then returns the bills. \n\nMy recollection was that it worked out to about 42 cents. But even if my memory is off,and it had been, say, $1.42, it was still a shockingly low price.\n\nWhen we first arrived we couldn\u2019t find the dorm. The directions were very vague. We stopped at a car mechanic shop and asked if anyone could figure out the directions. No one spoke English. He packed us into the tiniest car and drove around like a maniac for about 20 minutes, stopping occasionally to inquire about a given place. Eventually we arrived at the right place, which it turned out was only about 3-4 blocks from the mechanic\u2019s. We have a handful of cash, hoping it wouldn\u2019t be an insulting amount. Maybe $15-20? He took a long stare at the cash, then gave us both a long, suspicious stare. It wasn\u2019t quite london taxicab money but we were, after all, just broke college kids. \n\nWe made friends with the guy who ran our dorm, and he offered to show us around. We offered to pay for everything. It was a great day out. \n\nWe asked him about the mechanic and the cash. He said we probably have him the equivalent of several weeks\u2019 wages.  \n\nNote: $20 in 1990 is about $47 today, when you account for inflation.",

At first I was like scared but realized what he was saying and turned to my side. Next morning i apologize to everyone and they were cool. Next night i waited a bit long to go to sleep to give everyone a head start.  \n\nIf a person was snoring, I would not mind and just wished I went to bed earlier. But if that person was snoring to high heaven, I would gently speak to them to turn on their side or bump the bed a bit. If both tactic dont work then I just deal with it. \n\nIf people are having sex, i rustle in my bed and groan in discomfort. Or I just wake up and leave room. Sometimes ill passively aggressively whisper that ill be back in an hour and they owe me a beer in the morning and wish the others in the room good luck.",

I woke him up a few times. Needless to say, we haven't stayed at a shared room hostel since. Moral of the story: not much you can really do. BRING EARPLUGS!!!

I\u2019ve had a person medium snoring - annoying, but sleepable.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve had an occasion where the snorer was so loud, not a single person in the dorm got a moment of sleep. All 5 of us sat there talking all night because we couldn\u2019t sleep a wink. He was so loud the bed was vibrating and you could hear it down the hallway. One of us went to reception - and the receptionist could hear him from reception! - and she put the snorer in a private room the next night.\n\nIn the morning snorer was like \u2018oh yeh I have sleep apnea, I\u2019m like a freight train every night and my wife sleeps in another room\u2019. What a prick. Who knowingly does that to people?!\n\nSo I guess, it pays off to snore?\n\nAlso: women snore less if you can get an all-women dorm.\n\nI don\u2019t stay in dorms anymore.",

There's no way she didn't know about her snoring, either - she woke herself up multiple times throughout the night with the noise. I don't know what it is with loud snorers being horrible at daytime as well. \n\nI usually just put on my headphones and listen to anti-snoring white noise from YouTube.

I mean ear plugs do nothing for this level of noise, sometimes not even headphones playing music. It might even vibrate your bed all night if they're on the same bunk as you. Half the room is up seething or groaning when their sleep apnea has them choking or gasping for breath at an inconsistent rate so you can't even start to drown out a pattern.\n\nThere's no way these folks don't know about their problem and have probably had friends and partners complain to them or ask them to get help, and yet they subject the room to levels of noise that are louder than acceptable for any other behavior. When people complain about snorers they're mostly complaining about situations like this, and I really think the onus of responsibility is on the person who knows that they cannot keep a reasonable level of noise in a shared room to exercise respect for others and opt for a private room.",

One friend I travelled with said I was the quietest person they shared a room with, another friend told me I kept mumbling all night and kept waking her.

People come and go, middle of the night zipping suitcase to run and catch a flight, etc. But if you know you\u2019re a constant snorer or snore when you are drinking too much, then get a private room. There is a difference between random noises in the hostel room compared to fucking snoring all night long.",

Like literally cuts through any sort of ear plug/ headphone type of snoring. The type of snoring where you are concerned for their health. \n\nIf that is keeping literally everyone awake, imo you have the right to wake them up &amp; get them to sleep on their side. I\u2019m currently on month 9 of my hostel-only trip and I\u2019ve only had to do that twice. \n\nFor example - I grind my teeth when I sleep. It\u2019s not subtle either, it\u2019s really fucking loud. So I wear a mouth guard. I lost it and couldn\u2019t find one for about a week. So I got a private room since I knew I\u2019d be keeping everyone awake. \n\nWe aren\u2019t talking about little snoring here. That\u2019s expected. But if it\u2019s keeping literally everyone up, imo you have the right to do something about it.",

Someone turning on a small light, an alarm going off once or twice and someone moving around the hostel. Maybe showering (if it\u2019s an en-suite). \n\nI think the only things I would really be annoyed at is if someone was being deliberately uncontentious. Like turning on the big light, making lots of noise, banging about, having sex/wanking, using a hairdryer etc etc. \n\nI think snoring is just someone you have to put up with in a \u201cpublic\u201d room, and if you can\u2019t then you should really be getting private ones.",

Get checked for sleep apnea (even for their own health), or get a private room or something. The whole point of a dorm room is to be able to sleep and a snorer is basically taking that away from the other people in the room. Happened to me too once but I was luckily able to change rooms.\n\nEdit: snoring goes on throughout the night, whereas coming into the room late/making some noise probably won't be ongoing, so it's not taking away from others in the same extent. Just my view on it.",

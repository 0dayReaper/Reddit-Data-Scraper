    "postText": "What are people's experiences of long-term travel like (by long term, 6 months+)? In that period, did the constant routine of staying in hostels, socialising and meeting new people on a daily basis get old and did it become more of a chore? And visiting site after site, did become desensitised to seeing so much? I'm curious to know what people do to keep long term trips fresh.\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude42",

I stopped because I ran out of money,or because I had reached my 'goal'.\n\nI think a key thing is not to keep constantly moving, and not to keep constantly 'sightseeing' either... that's when you get tired and jaded.",

            "comment": "Yes, over and over answering the same questions becomes a chore, yes visiting site after site becomes a chore. We see loads of posts of people that get burned out/bored on long trips. Most people get tired of it at some point. Some after a few weeks, others after a few months or years, relatively few last longer than 5 years.\n\n&gt; I'm curious to know what people do to keep long term trips fresh.\n\nNot sure the key is to keep it fresh. Maybe even the opposite, you want some kind of routine and a purpose to your trip. If you drag yourself from sight to sight without goal or purpose that gets old quickly. If you've no goal or purpose you consequently have only pointless things to do. Hard to get motivated for that after the novelty wears off and without any kind of routine or anything to motivate you it's easy to stay in bed or the hostel bar all day.\n\nIf you define a goal and purpose to the trip things become much easier. You work towards something. You've a reason to get up, to work towards that goal whatever it may be. If you encounter hardship you've a reason to overcome it. If you set out to overland from A to B, every day you move you get a little bit closer to your goal. If you set out to write a book about say funerary rites in different cultures every ritual attended, every interview conducted, every tomb visited you get a little closer to your goal. And with a goal to your trip you can afterwards point to an achievement that may help you further in life. If you can explain a gap in your CV with 'I crossed the African continent by bicycle' or 'I researched this and wrote a book or blog about it' that can actually be advantageous for your career even if unrelated to your study as it shows some personality and you stand out from the crowd so it can help to open doors. While a gap year doing 'nothing' is more likely perceived as a wasted year.",

I try and avoid hostels now after almost two years of travel solo experience they are just not for me anymore. \n\nHostels in India are the worst because Indians have no etiquette in public spaces, that was the last straw for me.",

Currently in a big European city and tragically disappointed with myself. \n\nI prefer natural escapes. A city is a city is a city imo, and besides looking at things, it\u2019s best spent spending money - which I think is best with the company of others. I\u2019m not one for new hostel friends either, gets old quick. I like meaning in a relationship of any kind. If someone comes along while I\u2019m doing my thing, cool. But you won\u2019t catch me seeking a friend for the night. \n\nMy 2c",

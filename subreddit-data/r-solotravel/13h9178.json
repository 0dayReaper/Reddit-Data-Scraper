    "postText": "I (24M) am heading off to Israel for an archaeological dig in June, and I have the opportunity to do some travelling for a week and a half before the program starts. I want to make sure I am not wasting my time traveling too much as I am only taking public transport/shuttles so that I can enjoy the major cities and sites (I'm Jewish).\n\nDay 01 - 02 (13/06 - 14/06): Tel Aviv\n\nSpending the first two days recovering from the Jetlag on the beach and nice dining. I don't think there's too much to see in Tel Aviv besides the beach and party scene so I think this will be a good way to unwind.\n\nDay 03 - 05 (15/06 - 17/08): Jerusalem\n\nJerusalem is the real city to see in my opinion. I'm interested in exploring the old city to death, going along Ben Yehuda street, visiting Ir David, the caves and museums. I also intend to spend Shabbat in the city. \n\nDay 06 (18/06): Masada + Dead Sea tour\n\nOff on a group tour to a sunrise trek up Masada to beat the heat and then to the Dead Sea before returning to Jerusalem.\n\nDay 07 (19/06): Jerusalem\n\nBack in Jerusalem to see the anymore sites (still not 100% sure on what else to look for) and to enjoy some dining while in the big city.\n\nDay 08 (20/06): Haifa\n\nTravel to Haifa, possible the evening beforehand. See the city and explore the Bahai gardens, possibly dip into the beach again.\n\nDay 09 (21/06): Acre\n\nI'm fascinated by the crusader city here and would love to see the ruins and the old city, and especially the museums here.\n\nDay 10 (22/06): Safed\n\nI've heard Safed is a gorgeous small city to visit and that the food is amazing. I imagine that between the travel times and getting lost in the winding streets I will easily spend a day here. My friends could not recommend the city more to me!\n\nDay 11 - 12 (23/06 - 24/06): Tiberias\n\nI was hoping to make it to Nimrod Castle, however I am worried that I will get stranded as it is a Friday and I am only taking public transport (unless there's a tour available). I think Tiberias would be a lovely place to spend Shabbat relaxing by the Sea of Galilee and possibly even seeing the ancient/medieval ruins too. I will then make it to the archaeological site (Mishmar HaEmek) after Shabbat on Saturday night for a early start on Sunday. That will wrap up my pre-excavation trip.\n\nI will also have 3 free weekends while on the dig (Thurs - Sat) to do some smaller trips. I am hoping to visit Bet She'arim National Park, Caesarea and possibly Nimrod Castle, but I am open to suggestions.\n\nI know this is quite brief, but I would like to get your thoughts on my plan. My worries is that I am not spending enough time in Jerusalem and that I might not have enough planned to fill out my days outside of Jerusalem. What are your thoughts and suggestions?",

            "comment": "Old Jaffa is nice to explore, but yeah, Tel Aviv is more for relaxing and unwinding. It's easier to get to Haifa and Acre from there though (take the train), so I'd move those destinations up your schedule. Even Caesaria is easier from there too probably, though I can't vouch for that route personally.\n\nFor Jerusalem, it's not like you'll miss it, but the market  is also nice to experience; turns into a hangout spot at night. Might as well visit Jericho and Bethlehem while you're seeing Masada and the Dead Sea?",

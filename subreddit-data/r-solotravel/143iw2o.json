    "postText": "Hello! I'm a 29M from Canada looking to do my first solo travel in nearly 5 years, and plan on going to Peru/Bolivia in April/May 2024 for 3 weeks, give or take a day (I'm self-employed &amp; flexible). I'm interested in pre-Columbian civilizations, history, art/culture, and of course the beautiful landscapes of the area. Zero interest in cuisine. Mostly being budget-conscious but splurging at key points (Inca Trail + Nazca Lines flight for example).\nI've been working out my itinerary and think it's about ready for feedback from you lovely people! Here's what I have so far:\n\n.\n\n**PERU:**\n\n* Lima (2 full days) (~5 hour bus to next destination)\n\n* Huacachina (1 night) (~3 hour bus to next destination)\n\n* Nazca/Atacama Desert/Cantalloc Aqueducts (day trip on the way to Arequipa; ~10 hour bus)\n\n* Arequipa; use this location to rest/acclimatize to elevation (2 days) (~13 hour bus to next location)\n\n(I also wanna see Lake Titicaca + islands either on the way to or from Bolivia to break up bus trip, but not sure which side of Titicaca border is best, or whether to overnight there.)\n\n.\n\n**BOLIVIA**\n\n* La Paz (4 or 5 days; would wanna do Tiwanaku as day trip or on the way in/out)\n\n(also wondering what border crossing is like for Canadians; I hear USA citizens have a harder time. Also, I hear going with Peru Hop over the border makes things easier but I'm unsure about how)\n\n.\n\n**BACK TO PERU**\n\n* Cuzco (8 or 9 days incl. 4 day Inca Trail)\n\n* Inca Trail\n\n* Ollantaytambo day trip (on the way back from Inca Trail to Cusco)\n\n* Flight to Trujillo? (2 days; this is the part of trip I'm least sure of since it's out of the way but I'd love to see Chan Chan and other historic ruins)\n\n* Lima again (1 more night, fly out next day)\n\n.\n\n**So, some questions:** \n\n* Is this trip too rushed/broad? Should I plan for more 'rest' days to acclimatize or allow for other time loss?\n\n* I often see itineraries going straight from Lima to Cusco by plane. Is there a reason for doing this that I'm missing other than being short on time?\n\n* How possible is it to take a plane on short notice for a reasonable price? If say I lost time somewhere and needed to quickly get a flight to make up for it, would that be doable?\n\n* Peru/Bolivia Hop seems good in some ways but not in others. Maybe I misunderstand it but it seems to always insist you need to see this or that thing on your way to a certain place, and stop/delay in those places for hours. Is that the case, or does it simply drop people off who wanna stay in an area before going on its way, like a regular bus? Are they regular or do they only depart at 6 or 7 am?\n\n* I'm trying to go on this trip at a sweet spot of reasonable weather while at the same time not being swamped with other tourists. Is mid-April to mid-May good for this?\n\n* I keep hearing people say that public buses in South American cities are sketchy, but why is that? I usually heavily rely on public transit/metro when in cities rather than taxis or Ubers, but if there's a good reason to avoid city buses let me know!\n\n* Any anecdotes about doing the Inca Trail, its difficulty, what it's like when someone can't make it or runs into problems, will be helpful too! I'm reasonably good at walking for very long periods but inexperienced with hiking, so somewhat apprehensive.\n\n.\n\nThanks so much for anyone who responds to this! &lt;3",

The group you\u2019ll go with will have varying fitness levels, so there will be plenty of breaks. I can\u2019t stress enough, though, that you give yourself a few days to acclimate to the altitude in Cusco. I wasn\u2019t sure how important that was but did it anyways and I\u2019m glad I did\u2014 2 girls in my group did it the day after landing and had to be sent back to Cusco after the first night in an ambulance. From the guides reactions, it sounds like that is far and away the #1 reason people don\u2019t make it to the end.",

And yes I'm taking the possibility of bad altitude sickness seriously, so I hope that my 'rest' days in Arequipa and 5 days around La Paz/Lake Titicaca give me a good amount of time to acclimatize. I'll stick around Cusco for a few days before taking on the trail as well. Could you tell me a bit about what symptoms the girls were having that they had to leave? Thanks again :)",

But if you\u2019re acclimating I wouldn\u2019t worry about that. Maybe just bring some headache and anti-nausea medication if you want to be super prepared.",

            "comment": "For your questions:\n\npacing seems fine. I'm not sure how your Arequipa days are calculated. But seeing most of the city itself will be a full day, and a possible daytrip to the condors is another. That's the most popular locations there.\n\nYour itinerary is better then flying, I assume those people are just rushed\n\nI didn't feel like Peruhop insisted on much. They just walk by with a flyer and if you say no that's that. There's a few highly suggested things (the islands and desert in Paracas, which you left out but their route goes through that to Huacachina, the Nazca lines in Nazca but there's no reason to visit those places if  you aren't doing those sights, it's fine.) There's an obligatory visit to a Pisco place included, but you aren't forced to buy anything there. There's a bunch of things a lot of people do that I didn't want to do and it was no issue. It's not a regular bus though, it leaves once a day. Not always 6 am, but you can't just hop on. If you want to stay somewhere longer its perfectly fine to just say that though.\n\nHad 0 issues with public transport and took buses, trains and the metro. Keep watch on your stuff of course, but didn't feel unsafe. Went to non tourist areas, didn't feel unsafe either.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for your input!\n\nI'll have to get in touch with PeruHop because there's still some things I don't get about how it works. Like, say I wanna go from Lima to Huacachina to spend a night but don't wanna stop in Pisco--I guess I just gotta stop in Pisco anyway? And then if I spend a night in Huacachina and the PeruHop leaves, another PeruHop will be leaving Huacachina in the morning that I can catch? I do know Cruz del Sur is an alternative so I may alternate between PH and them.\n\nI'm mostly using Arequipa to give myself breathing room to rest/acclimatize, and to break up the long bus rides, so I think I'll be sticking fairly close to my area while there. That way my ascent into super high altitudes can be done in chunks, because I really don't wanna get altitude sickness :) Thanks as well for the feedback about buses--I do plan on going into several non-tourist areas so it's nice to hear Peru's not too dangerous if you're being common-sense.",

                            "comment": "I guess you mean Paracas instead of Pisco :) Everyone on my bus stepped out there, so I do think you have to stay the night probably. It's worth it though with your interests, there's nice landscapes (coming from a guy who doesn't travel for nature even) and there is theoretically speaking a museum with unique remains (look up the paracas skulls) although the museum was non existent when I went due to them still recovering from Covid. Maybe its back.\n\nThat said, I think there were some on my bus that skipped Huacachina so it can't hurt mailing them beforehand what's possible. Maybe if you can skip one town you can skip the other. And yeah, once you get to Huacachina they ask if you want to have the bus for the next morning, and then they explain where the bus will be. For me, since some people managed to get lost in the tiny town the guide ran around for a bit too to find people. \n\nFor Arequipa, make sure to go to the little museum for the mummified kid. The place is fairly high up and surrounded with mountains so it probably helps with the acclimation. At the very least, I had zero issues with altitude sickness.\n\nOh and by the way, Peruhop does offer plane rides for the Nazca lines, but a stop at a sight tower is included for free in the veeeeery long busride day. The guy I met who took the plane ride said he didn't see that much and that a girl vomited all over the plane due to the way they swerve. I don't regret picking the tower instead. I didn't see anyone actually stay in Nazca town, it didn't seem very tourist friendly and rather sketch, although I never felt unsafe either, just a bit uncomfortably surrounded by poverty as a comparably rich western tourist",

With respect to Salkantay is a very beautiful route, you can do it on your own, there are lodges or places to sleep on the way, you can even do it without a tent, but you must take certain considerations.",

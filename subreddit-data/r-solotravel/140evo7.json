    "postText": "I am going on a tour with G-Adventures next week to Paris for 2 days, Interlaken for 3, and Rome for 2. The itinerary says we will have things like orientation walks and then 'free time' but I have not actually booked  any activities in order to avoid queues. I don't really know what I want to do.. I thought I'd just meet the people on the tour and sort of go with the flow. Can anyone who has been on one of these tours let me know if it's necessary to book? I also don't know exactly what time our free time would be etc so o didn't want to commit. Any advice would be appreciated.",

            "comment": "No, you really don't have to book anything ahead in those cases, because the tour itself is what you've booked ahead. When you have \"free time\" in those places, generally speaking, you and some other people on your tour will go check things out together. Usually your tour leader or guide will make some suggestions. And often, those tours have optional activities that can be booked for you by the tour leaders.",

This would mean having to go alone without your tour buddies though. \n\nOtherwise if you\u2019re pretty relaxed about what you want to see then you can go with the flow but be aware that major attractions may not be an option in Paris and Rome on the day. I did a G Adventures tour a few years ago and from memory the tour itinerary suggested times to book for some activities (eg book entry after 4pm).",

My guide had a habit of making a 1 hour city tour into a 5 hour trek without stopping for food until there was mutiny!",

We didn't have to book anything in advance, so you can just decide as and when it comes. Your tour leader will probably give you a few options of what to do in your free time or you can always do your own thing.",

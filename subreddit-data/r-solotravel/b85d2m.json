    "postText": "Here are some things I learned during my recent trip in Europe. I think they don't just apply to traveling solo, but to life in general, but the trip made me aware of it:\n\n* Socializing is like a muscle, you need to warm it up every day. Even if you don't feel like it, just make smalltalk to some random person. Afterwards everything is much easier.\n* Don't have expectations how your trip will be, because it most likely won't be like that anyways. Just living in the moment and paying attention to the things around you takes a lot of pressure from you.\n* It really does not matter what you say to people when introducing yourself. One day I just said \"Hi, I'm X\" and went for a handshake. Afterwards explored the city with these guys for hours and we went for beers in the evening.\n* Just showing up is already a big step. Take a book, go to some social place, have a look around once in a while and eventually someone will ask you what you are doing/reading there.\n* There are up and downs, and that is fine. Anticipate the downs, take a rest day, but recognize that this is no permanent state. Also try to rationalize why you are feeling down. E.g. for me it was: Bad weather, feeling a bit ill and nobody I could talk to in my hostel.\n* Don't let \"failures\" drag you down. One night, I had no plans for the evening and there was nobody in my hostel. I decided to go to an Couchsurfing meetup but it turned out it didn't took place this evening. Later I tried to join a pub crawl in the city but the people there were already pretty drunk and I didn't want to hang out with them. So I decided to go to a bar on my own, but it turned out that they wanted 5\u20ac just for entry. I just went home to the hostel then. I guess such evenings just happen, but I still have experienced more than if I would've stayed at home.\n\nEdit: Didn't expect that to get so much resonance, thanks for the kind feedback everyone!",

They also have distinct local cuisine I quite liked..  plus the old town is really cool and fun to walk around during the day and in the evening.\n\nOther than that I liked Ninh Binh.  It's not a usual stop for travellers, but I paid a motorcycle dude to drive me around the sights, and it was brilliant.  Not much to see in the city itself, the the sights around town are def. worth it.",

I had to walk through the whole place twice to find it.  Definitely worth a visit\n\nAt the Noodle House get the medium rare (or rare maybe?) beef pho\n\nMy top 5 Ph\u1edf in Vietnam List\n\n1.

You\u2019ll find great food and markets there along with bookstores, malls, anything you need. The locals there are super friendly and tourist accommodating. I wouldn\u2019t recommend going to the big restaurants, rather trusting and diving into the small local food shops and carts are 100% way better trust!! Also, from there you can go to Hoi An, and Da Nang has its own international airport too. \n\nThe routine for locals is to go to the beach at sunrise before work. The vibe and sense of community is poppin\u2019. No one really goes during the day other than tourists or company outings. So I recommend for you to wake up at 4/5 and see what it\u2019s all about. You\u2019ll be able to see fishermans get fish and the beautiful sunrise too. SOOOOOOO worth it. ",

It's easy to want to land in a new place with a huge list of things you want to do, but I've found that the things I've found most memorable from various trips tend to be at best tangentially related to the bullet points I drew up beforehand.\n\nLikewise, showing up with no expectations provides a lot of flexibility and freedom, but if you're not sufficiently proactive in finding things to do, you'll miss out on opportunities, and lose valuable vacation time to indecision. \n\nI think it's possible to have a great trip either way, but avoiding the absolutes of \"I have planned every minute, stop, and step of my trip\", and \"I am here and have literally zero ideas of what I want to do\", will provide a much more substantial foundation for a good time.

Things changed since I started to travel around.I found it really interesting just talking to different people from all over the world, and the desire to know these wonderful stories told by these people finally conquered my fear of opening up my mouth.

    "postText": "So my rough plan is:\n\nfly into Bogota (land at 4 am) and take a flight straight to Salentos \n\nDay 1-3: Salentos \n\nDay 4 - flight to Medellin\n\nDay 4-7 - Medellin\n\nDay 8 - fly to Cartagena - take private transfer directly to Tayrona \n\nDay 8 -10 - Tayrona \n\nDay 10 - drive back to Carategena \n\nDay 10 -12 - Cartagena, fly home \n\nI'll be travelling solo, so scared to venture off into smaller towns/less touristic places. Any tips appreciated!",

When are you planning on going?\n\nCouple things:\n\nMost people fly to Pereira and then bus to Salento; you can't fly into Salento.\n\nSanta Marta is closer to Tayrona than Cartagena. I would recommend flying in there and then bussing from there to Cartagena.",

    "postText": "I (from UK) am planning to go to Australia on the WHV January 2024. I have a supportive boyfriend who isn't coming but is happy to do long distance, and I'm currently working my dream job. The issue is that my job, while they are willing to grant me a sabbatical, will not allow me to undertake any paid work on my trip. They will let me work on a voluntary basis however as it will benefit my career (I work with animals) but won't budge on paid work.\n\nI was planning to go for 6 months of the visa, at least initially as I'm not sure I'll enjoy solo travelling since I've never done it. I have saved 12k over the last 12 months, 10k of this was for a house deposit when I get home and the rest was to go towards getting me started in Oz.  Now I'm thinking I'll have to sacrifice my deposit to be able to stay in Oz for the time I want. I'm generally good with money so could save another few grand before I leave but I still don't think it will be enough. I wanted to get the opinions of people who have done this before and if it's worth it or if I should cut my losses, quit my job and hope they rehire me on my return or soon after. I really don't want to quit if avoidable as I got very lucky getting my job and its quite niche.\n\nI should add that I'm happy to do voluntary work, I plan on working with animals to some degree so it would be beneficial to me and I'm mostly looking to go for the experience of solo travelling, money is only so I can pay to live while I'm there.\n\n\u25cfIs it possible to not do paid work while on the WHV?\n\n\u25cfHow much roughly can I expect to spend in 6 months (cost of living etc)\n\n\u25cfWould it be worth quitting my dream job so i can work?",

You'll need MINIMUM 20k AUD to lead a modest life for 6 months. We have a lot of animal shelters, sanctuarys, zoos, doggy day cares etc here so finding work with animals won't be hard ( we probably pay a lot better here too)",

Sydney is insanely expensive too, you can probably find a decent short term furnished room to rent privately for 250 a week and not have to be in shared sleeping space. Perth and Adelaide are much more cost of living friendly (I'm in Perth).\nIf your employer knows you're overseas do they really expect you to not work part time? Seems odd.",

No days off (babies to feed, poop to scoop), some days were long and some were extremely sad.  But I got to hang out with kangaroos, live in the middle of nowhere without spending any money at all.\n\nIt's absolutely possible to come over and do that for a year moving between different animal rescues for a change of scenery.  \n\nAlso, it was just announced that the UK-aus free trade agreement is going to be active by the end of may, which comes with whv visa changes (age limit upped to 35 and removal of farm days requirement for subsequent visas), so you likely won't even need to work to qualify for a second and third year working holiday if you ever wanted to come back!",

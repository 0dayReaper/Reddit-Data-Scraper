It all just happens maybe a hour ago.\nAnd to be honest.\nI am having a little difficulty processing it all.",

It was more the inconvenience of getting another phone and the numbers I would have lost that I found annoying.\n\nI was working in the favela next to the beach at the time and I knew the kids were from there. They were pretty young and I have a feeling I could have got the phone back pretty quickly if I'd asked around. I just didn't want all the hassle but I definitely would not recommend anybody else to chase down people like that. A couple of wrong turns and you can find yourself surrounded pretty quickly.",

For my next experiment I'd like to try to add a bit of gelatin to the stick and placing cubes of it in the crust edges. Kind of like a delicious pizza soup dumpling.",

I told him I didn't believe him, and he showed me something that looked like the canon of a firearm under his clothes. I gave him some cash (less than $10 dls lol), and he went off. \n\n2 minutes later, I'm with the cops at the entrance of the Transmilenio station. 5 minutes later, they came back on their motorcycles with the guy. In the end, it wasn't a firearm. It was just a rusty pipe. I didn't press charges, but the cops told me they were probably going to \u201cshake him\u201d after I left. \n\nSo that's my absurd attempt of mugging in Colombia.",

Be aware of scooters and motorbikes, especially if they are riding 2-up. There are thieves who will prowl around looking for victims. When they spot a potential target, like a tourist walking down the sidewalk, not paying attention to the bag hanging off their shoulder street-side as they gawk at the scenery, they'll roll up fast on you. The one on the back will grab or cut your bag away from you as they speed past you. Or snatch the phone and selfie-stick right out of your hand.\n\n\n2. As a white male gringo, be *very* cautious about really good-looking Colombian women approaching you online or in clubs. If she looks like she is \"out of your league\" she probably is, Romeo. Do a self-check in the mirror, lol! There sadly have been many examples of gringo men getting approached, drugged, and robbed by beautiful women. Colombia doesn't really have a \"pick up culture\" like the US has, it's still largely a bit more traditional. If she wants to go back to your place after just meeting you, that's not really normal for most Colombian women, that's kind of a red flag.\n\nEnjoy the rest of your trip in beautiful Colombia! Just be aware of your surroundings (even in broad daylight) and try not to look like a lost tourist.",

Asked me to go with her to introduce me to her mom halfway across the country, then dumped me days after I said yes because she \u201crealized she was falling in love with me and wasn\u2019t ready for that.\u201d Still hurts, kinda wish she had just robbed me. \n\nI did wind up getting robbed later on in Medellin, too, so yay I guess. 11am drinking tea on a patio, three guys on motorbikes with a gun rush up the stairs and rough me up and take everything I\u2019ve got, namely my then-new iPhone 13 Pro Max. I figured I\u2019d be safe from broad daylight bullshit like that in Laureles, especially since there\u2019s plenty of locals with expensive stuff walking around, but nope.\n\nPolice were unsurprisingly totally unsympathetic and useless with the standard \u201cno dar papaya\u201d victim blaming and couldn\u2019t care less that I had tracking on the phone.

I was in Switzerland back in 2015 and was walking down the road with my laptop in my hands (I'm a total tourist mess) and this cute Swiss girl was sitting at a table at a restaurant/bar and I asked her if she knew about any Wi-Fi in the area. Next thing you know my laptop was away and I was sitting there having a drink with her. Later on that evening we were at a bar drinking beer and eating popcorn. About an hour later I had her legs up over my shoulders and we were going at it like we were in a hay loft of a barn. We stayed in touch after that for about 6 months with me visiting twice. It blew up because we were completely opposite personalities and also she lived 8 hours away by airplane, LOL. But you can be overseas and get a woman who is way better looking than you could get back home, it is possible.",

Another time a kid rode up on a bike and flashed what appeared to be a gun. \n\nGenerally they want cell phones and cash. Not taking your cell phone out on the street and having a little cash in your pocket to hand over is a solid strategy. Use a hidden inside pocket for actual cash. Depending on length of stay sewing emergency cash into clothing isn't a bad idea. I did this during a 4 year trek through Central and South America but was probably overkill. I was never successfully robbed in any situation",

Once dead, whether the life was long or short, it won't matter to that individual. Furthermore, life and death are complementary. To negate one is to negate both. Fear of death is fear of life.

Give them my cash, or pretend I didn't hear them and keep walking until I got to some cops up ahead, and it was my last cashier's check so I just kept going, and they backed down... Then at the checkpoint the cops took my cash.\"\n\nMoral of the story - \n\n1.  avoid carrying large amounts of cash at all costs, keep one of those hidden bags and maybe even another.  I travel with two wallets and leave one with my passport locked up in a safe or hidden pocket of an otherwise unassuming bag.  \n\n2. Always look like you know what you're doing and are local if you can help it but if not - politeness and ignorance goes a LONG way.  I was robbed once and because I had been nice to the robber before he jacked me and ran he at least threw my credit cards on the ground while running away so I could have them back - I know someone who had a robber give them back their passports but keep their cash when they caught up to him.  \n\n3.  Local police are not your friends - at best they're usually disinterested in tourists and at worst they can create even more problems.  ALWAYS CALL YOUR EMBASSY.  They can give you a ride, a hotel, food, etc... Which brings me to \n\n4.  The embassy often has a first line of screening conducted by local police/personnel, at least that was my experience during off hours in countries like UK for American embassy.  These people WILL NOT help you unless your situation is imminently life-threatening.  Demand to speak to an American/your country's citizen.  It's within your right to do so apparently, and while the phone screeners can claim to be embassy personnel, their power is limited and they must contact official embassy personnel when asked to do so.  Maybe someone with more than my anecdotal experience here can shed some light on the mechanics.  Actual embassy members will generally resolve your issues incredibly expeditiously on contact (again, experiences based on US citizenship)",

I did hear of plenty of others who got mugged there, so just because I was safe doesn\u2019t mean everyone else will be. \n\nIt\u2019s like the survivorship bias everyone has on life: well, I\u2019m still alive, so it must not be too bad to\u2026 (insert dangerous thing: drive fast, travel there, hike that trail, smoke cigarettes, etc.)",

I would honestly go just for the food, but I also really enjoyed getting out to the surrounding islands and relaxing on the beach too. Colombia is such an amazing place though, I was there for 1.5 month and feel like I barely scratched the surface visiting 5 cities/areas. I've met people while traveling that spent 6+ months in Columbia that still said they had a ton more they wished they could have done.

Not all of us travel to experience another culture. If a culture doesn't line up with my own... we prob. won't get along. Animal abuse common in their culture? Women treated like second-class citizens in their culture? They litter and shit in the streets? They can all fuck right off.\n\nI travel to experience our Earth and it honestly sucks how many absolutely amazing things Earth has created are ruined by the local cultures (and country borders) they fall in and around. Hence, I don't care about people cultures... if I want the taste of their food I can find the recipe online and make it myself with higher hygienic standards, music I can also find online, their language I don't need to learn since I already speak four and English is extremely prevalent and preferred worldwide... why would a traveller like myself want to immerse locally?\n\nAnd, to add, we live in the age of technology... most worldwide cultures have been exposed to the Western cultural standards... my point being that immersing yourself in the local culture isn't what it was 30, 40, 50+ years ago. Now you can travel to Nuuk, Greenland and see that the way of life is very similar to what you'd see in NYC anyway... just that the environment is different. So... travel doesn't have to be about immersing yourself in culture too... for some of us it really is about seeing the environment and doing that monster hike on one of the world's tallest peaks.",

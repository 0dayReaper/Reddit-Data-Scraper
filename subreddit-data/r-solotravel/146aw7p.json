    "postText": "hi all,\n\nsolo travelling to lebanon in august and was wondering if any of you had visited Tripoli. Beirut/Byblos/Baalbek all seem great but would love to have an authentic non-tourist oriented experience as well and tripoli seems like a great place. I was thinking of maybe doing a day trip there but navigating as an american who speaks 0 arabic sounds intimidating..\nanyone been? any advice?",

Indeed Tripoli is less tourist-oriented but I\u2019d say a day trip should be fine even if you don\u2019t speak Arabic. I\u2019m not sure how you plan on getting around, and maybe there are day tours you can join(just googled quickly, there are). But if you prefer solo, you can drive/walk around with google maps and visit areas like the Tripoli citadel with an amazing view over the city, the old souk, the Rachid Karami fair if you\u2019re into architecture, etc with no need to speak to anyone. You might find people who speak English also. Be sure to eat at Hallab 1881!",

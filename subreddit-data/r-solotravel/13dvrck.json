    "postText": "Just looking for some advice about a potential solo trip in Italy this June. A good friend of mine has a conference in Naples in June and the original plan was for me to tag along, mostly solo but us meeting up for dinners and then spending a couple days together. Seems like she may not be going, which not only leaves me without a place to stay one night, but also has me bopping around like a maniac for no reason. \n\nThis is the current itinerary (I don't like how much moving there is, but it was to follow my friend so I was ok with it):\n\nDay 1: Fly into Naples, arrive early morning\n\nDay 2: Naples\n\nDay 3: Train to Rome\n\nDay 4: Rome\n\nDay 5: Train back to Naples\n\nDay 6: Naples\n\nDay 7: Bus to Sorrento\n\nDay 8: Capri and Sorrento\n\nDay 9: Back to Naples for night flight home\n\nI hate how much travel there is in this if I'm going to be solo and everything aside from my flights are refundable, so how would you guys recommend restructuring this to make it less shitty? The only thing that is firm is that I have to start and end in Naples. I would also like to stay in Southern Italy for this trip. I'm hoping to go back on another trip for Florence, Milan, etc. \n\nI'd also love any tips for things to do aside from the big things like the Vatican, Colosseum, etc. \n\nThanks in advance guys!",

            "comment": "You're in luck: Naples to Rome may seem far, but it's only a bit over an hour by train. \n\nSo you don't need to stay in Naples when you arrive, just head straight on to Rome and \"begin\" your trip there. Then you can do a solid 3 days in both Rome and the Amalfi coast.\n\nIn fact, if you wanted to, you could try [this route with Florence](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=naples$0$e$r~florence$2~rome$3$r~sorrento$3$r&amp;trans=Train&amp;nights=8&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;). Basically it would be:\n\n - 3 nights in Rome (1-1.5 hrs from Naples) - consider pre-booking the Forum, Borghese Gallery and Vatican Museum, though Rome has plenty of world class sights to fill 3 days even if you don't.\n\n - 2 in Florence - make sure to prebook the Uffizi Gallery and Accademia! You won't have time to see them if you show up without a reservation.\n\n - 3 in Sorrento - day trips to Capri, and maybe Pompeii and Naples on the crescent line. Naples is a fantastic city - and the archaeaological museum is top notch - but can be a rough overnight if you aren't prepared.\n\nThat's sufficient time to give each place it's due on a quick trip, zero one-nighters, and all for less than an hour per travel day on a train!",

You could do Pompeii the day you're taking the train from Naples to Sorrento, since it's on the way. Day 9, take train back to Naples and fly home, or if it's an early flight, take the train back to Naples and spend the night before.",

It might take you a little longer to get to your destination but you'll see all the hidden gems along the way. (State Parks or random hiking trails. When I was driving through Idaho, I hiked a few miles through the Great Western Trail.) You get to see more scenic things that way. Also any park you get to early in the morning will be empty. I was at Bryce, Crater Lake, and Death Valley before 8 am and it felt as if I was the only person in the whole park.",

I think as a whole, every new park that I visited was a shock because it's easy to forget that places like these exist. You can look at every picture in the world or be given an explanation, but unless you go see for yourself, you will never really understand the meaning of having your breath taken away. ",

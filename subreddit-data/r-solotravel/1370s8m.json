    "postText": "My trip to London went great. I arrived in London Thursday April 27, left evening May 1. I'm a 20s woman from the US. \n\nThis was my first time leaving the country and did it by myself! Here is what I did, with details after. Also- I am not a \"fast\" experience kind of person, I don't speed through activities to check a box. There are people who want to ride everything at amusement parks and or want to see every single exhibit at the museum..I don't mind missing things if it means I can take my time, so this trip was not jam packed because that's not my personality. I also went at an unusual time- a week before the coronation (had no idea it was happening until about a month before my trip) so things were closed or adjusted etc. \n\nThursday: was lucky to get early check in at my hotel around 2pm. It started raining shortly after so I went to Tesco and looked at the interesting foods we don't have here. I chilled out for the rest of the evening and didn't do anything. \n\nFriday: Arome Bakery, Tower of London, Borough Market, John Soane House, Bon Gusto for dinner\n\nSaturday: Bageriet Bakery, Buckingham Palace, British Museum, Falafel kiosk at the intersection of Wells and Oxford, shopping, Dishoom for dinner\n\nSunday: Marylebone Corner Cafe, Art Museum,  River Thames boat tour, Victoria Embankment garden, Chicken Shop for dinner\n\nMonday: Tab X Tab for breakfast, Regent's Park, then headed to the airport excessively early because I had no idea how long security would be. \n\nMy favorite parts: Friday was the best day, I loved Tower of London and was glad I went to John Soane House, it was a great quick thing to see for free. I like how the museums are free but the lines form very quick and it gets extremely crowded quick. Tube was awesome for getting around. Also the employees at the LHR tube area and my hotel Tube station were so nice. I don't know if I got lucky or they are always friendly to tourists. \n\nLeast favorite: the cost of things after conversion to USD. The British Museum had almost too much stuff in it and I noticed a lot of the items were placed far below eye level and unappreciated or hard to see unless you crouched down...maybe good for kids or those in wheelchairs?? Not sure the reason. Also the Thames River boat tour was not worth the cost in my opinion but I think I had too high expectations. I wouldn't recommend it but it depends on what you like. \n\nSome cultural differences- a lot more smoking of cigarettes and vapes than I'm used to seeing where I live. Seems to be pretty much cash-less, I know in the US we use cards a lot but I do still see cash transactions. Over there it was tap for almost everything. Different water choices, sparkling, tap, and still water were offered to me in restaurants. \n\nWhat I spent: \n\nMy economy plane tickets were $469. My purchased seats were $74 total. The hotel was $595 for 4 nights, including the $40 I unnecessarily spent on breakfast..turns out I shouldn't pre-book breakfast until I actually see the options. Bummed about that because all the breakfast was croissants and yogurt and coffee, so I ended up eating breakfast out each day. \n\nEverything else including food, souvenirs, sim card, transit was $406. So my total for everything comes to $1544. I think this is probably stupidly expensive to some people. I had no idea what to expect or what is considered a good deal, I think I could have cut maybe $100 if I went food shopping and made dinners at the hotel, meals were crazy expensive to me after the conversion. The hotel was the lowest priced I could find that had sunlight (weird basement rooms in some hotels??) And that was still within the inner circle and was highly rated. \n\nWhat I'd do different:\n\nPre book my Heathrow express ticket in advance. I think its 90 days in advance. I did not know this until a few days prior to my trip that the heathrow express would be $38 round trip but its cheaper if you do it advance. So I took the elizabeth line into paddington. Then took the Piccadilly line back to the airport when it was time to leave. \n\nPre book the sky garden ticket in advance. I didn't know about this either until it was too late. Just pre book everything to be safe, even if it's free like the art museum, pre book the ticket. \n\nI personally did not need cash. I only took out cash for Borough market thinking it would be needed there. I ended up paying with my card for almost everything because it was easier or the place was cash less. I also think it's a lose-lose either way withdrawing money due to the fees and such. I'm going to take my money to the bank here and see if they'll exchange it. \n\nI thought Dishoom wasn't worth it but ate there just to experience it once, I made a reservation and still didn't get seated until 15 minutes past. It was clear there was a management and organizational issue the night I went- staff were not communicating well. \n\nMy basic pasta dish and glass of wine at Bon Gusto also was not worth the money\n\nMy summary- everything went smoothly and I'm glad I made the trip by myself.",

So for you you could change money from USD to Sterling and just have it in a holding account on that card. So when you tap the card you can choose to pay in USD or Sterling. So if you choose Sterling you don't get extra charges. They do charge you an exchange fee but it's generally much lower than either card fees or exchange fees to get cash.\n\nI use a Wyse card.

I have been watching a lot of Darren John videos featuring local, independent restaurants around London that do not cost an arm and a leg. Plus, he has a calming personality that eases my anxiety about my first solo trip away from North America.",

Even if you personally don't enjoy Shakespeare's plays, it's a fascinating bit of culture and history in London. The hop on &amp; off bus tours or free walking tours (although very touristy) are a really good way to learn about the city and get recommendations from locals \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAnd for future trips to any location not just London, I've generally found the same as you with hotel breakfasts being excessively expensive for no reason so I always go to local caf\u00e9's and spend \u00a35 for something tasty instead of \u00a325 for a croissant \ud83d\ude05",

What did you do while waiting for the checkin?\n\nHotel price seems to match what I've found in my research, how far were you from the center?\n\nDid you get a sim card or did you use your own?\n\nThanks!",

Then I had to wait 20 minutes on the train before we left the airport. So I think I actually found my hotel by 2pm, even thought it didn't seem like that much time had passed to me. \n\nMy plan was to drop off my bags and head to John Soane museum, but I was super exhausted from not being able to get sleep on the plane and just got lucky they let me check in at 2pm. Find a hotel that allows bag storage- most do. Or find a luggage locker through Bounce. \n\nThe nearest tube station was Bayswater from my hotel. There are several hotels nearby that station, not as nice or close to the center but I was fine with that location. \n\nBought a sim card- I wasn't sure how much Google Maps and various apps would use up, so I got way too much data. I bought 60gb (very clueless obviously) for about $35. I used less than 10GB and that was including using data in the hotel because the wifi was complete trash.\n\nEdit- be aware that the terminal I was in - terminal 2- didn't have many charging stations. I'm accustomed to having outlets everywhere in American airports and there were drastically fewer outlets in LHR. Same with exiting the airport, I only spotted 5 outlets near the baggage pickup.",

I looked up many \"trendy instagram\" places on Google maps where the reviews said \"skip this, it's just for instagram and the food was yucky\" and only picked highly reviewed places, doesn't matter if there were good experiences and some 5 stars, I didn't want to chance it and get a poor experience. \n\nI'd suggest picking any large park or open space to get some pictures, usually there is a bus/tube station close to every popular park. \n\nThe \"house\" museums like the one I went to John Soane House are good for less time and they aren't as large as the museums so you can see more in an hour. \n\nBorough market was big but the wait times weren't too bad so you may be able to squeeze that in.

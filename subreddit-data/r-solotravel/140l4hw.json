    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI just got back from a trip to Central Spain and am planning a more extensive solo trip for September in Spain and Portugal. Budget isn\u2019t a major concern, but I\u2019d like to be in the 3k range - will be staying in hostels. I am very proficient in Spanish but know no Portuguese.\n\nPossible Itinerary 1:\n\nTentative plan:\n\n- Overnight flight from US to Barcelona\n- 4 nights Barcelona\n- Travel to San Sebasti\u00e1n via train\n- 3 nights San Sebasti\u00e1n\n- Fly San Sebasti\u00e1n to Malaga, immediately take train to Granada\n- 2 nights Granada\n- Train to Sevilla\n- 3 nights Sevilla\n- Fly Sevilla to Lisbon\n- 3 nights Lisbon then fly home \n\nItinerary 2: \n\n- 3 nights in Barcelona\n- Fly to Porto \n- 2 nights in Porto \n- Train to Lisbon\n- 3 nights in Lisbon\n- Bus or Fly to Sevilla \n- 3 nights in Sevilla \n- Train to Granada\n- 2 nights in Granada \n- Train to Madrid \n- 2 nights in Madrid \n- Fly back from Madrid \n\nEssentially it would be San Sebasti\u00e1n vs. Madrid and Porto. I am currently leaning itinerary 2 since San Sebasti\u00e1n seems less convenient to get to compared to everywhere else, but I did go to Madrid for a bit on my last trip. However, I am very intrigued by the food scene and the contrast in coastlines - I\u2019m not sure what type of trip would bring me there again in the future.\n\nLet me know which seems more feasible and if you have any other suggestions of places to visit. Or alternatively if this seems too exhaustive. Thanks!",

E.g. stay in Malaga at the cooler seaside (September in Sevilla/Granada may be very very hot during daytime). This way you may add some more spots like Cordoba, Ronda, Gibraltar or Marbella. Just a thought :)\n\nThere is a bunch of interesting stuff btw Lisbon and Porto, if its an option, rent a car for the day and you can just stop and make a day out of it (Obidos, Fatima, Batalha etc.).",

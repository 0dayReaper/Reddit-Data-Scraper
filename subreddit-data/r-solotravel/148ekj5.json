    "postText": "Hi all, I (31M) booked a flight to India a couple of months ago for a 2 week trip on late October / early November. \nI was very excited and happy. I've travelled alone several times and I love it. \nMostly I've travelled in Europe (easy), then US (also easy for a European), Jordan, China and part of SEA (less easy maybe but still manageable).\nI've always had great time, never felt unsafe and I've always been able to handle any unexpected glitch.\n\nI'm usually pretty shrewd and aware when it comes to going around in new places, but the more I read about India and plan, the more I feel extremely anxious and consumed.\nFrom what I gathered it seems like I constantly have to be extremely aware of my surroundings, beware of scammers, and meticulously plan every move.\nIs this really the case? Surely turning 30 hit me like a freight train and my recklessness started fading, so probably I'm overthinking and exaggerating. \nStill, planning is clearly not easy, is it?\n\nThe worst part is that even the easiest things are confusing for some reason.\nFor example, I'll fly into Delhi late at night and I'd like to take a flight to Varanasi that morning. So, I'd like to book a room in a hotel for those few hours to rest and have a shower instead of roaming around the airport.\nBooking.com's map shows many hotels right outside the airport terminal. You only find out reading peoples' comments that they are actually located 10 minutes away from the airport by taxi.\nThis is really frustrating. How can I rely on these websites if things like this happen?\n\nAlso, I keep running into blogs saying the key is planning everything, so that you don't end up being alone outside at night.\nSo, I am planning. I'll take trains, but I've read they are usually late. So, what if I end up on a train running late leaving me in this new city late at night? Talking about trains, everyone says to book them as soon as they open bookings since the sell out quickly. So, what should I expect if I miss my train? The next one would be full for sure.\n\nI'd like to visit a park, like Pench or Kanha or Ranthambhore or Jim Corbett or whatever. All these parks have websites offering safaris, accommodations and packages. \nThey all have query forms but, guess what? No feedback at all.\n\nI know, this is probably just me worry about stupid things, but I feel like managing this trip needs more energy and time than I actually have at the moment, at the point I'm seriously thinking about joining a group, which is something I had always rejected in my life.\n\nUgh, any advice? \n\nEven comments saying I'm acting like a kid are well accepted. Thanks!\n\n\n___\n\nGuys, you have made my day. I wasn't expecting such a massive reaction to my post. Thank you very much. I really appreciate all this.",

            "comment": "Few tips from an Indian - \n\n* Get an Indian phone number, download these apps - MakeMyTrip (for booking anything and everything), Ola and Uber for cabs, if you head to Goa get GoaMiles for cabs. \n* When you book hotel rooms, look at the tourist photos and not the photos shared by the hotel.\n* Install Zomato for finding out good restaurants.\n* If anyone tells you \"Just cancel the booking and pay me directly\", cancel and leave.\n* Tourist trap places are just that. So keep to yourself, India is really well mapped out on Google Maps so you can find out which paths to take, etc.\n* Bookmyshow is another app for booking treks, hikes etc apart from movies, plays and concerts. They have been quite safe in my and my wife's experience.\n* For monuments, forts etc, there are usually government websites to book tickets online and skip queues. For ex, Google \"Humayun's Tomb online tickets\".\n* Redbus is a good app for booking buses as well. Try to book sleepers as they have curtains or even straight up doors so you will have your privacy throughout the ride.\n\nI'll add any others I can think of later.\n\nEdit: Thought of a couple other things:\n\n* You can get by with english in most places and people understand atleast a few words, but make sure you enunciate your words so that they can understand you better. \n* G(oogle)Pay/PayTM is now used everywhere and I rarely carry cash nowadays, but make sure you carry some change with you when you are travelling in buses as they have pitstops at night so that the passengers can use the toilet and these toilets usually charge a few rupees for use. Don't pay more than 5-10 rs for peeing though. (Don't be surprised to see men peeing on the side of the roads in such situations lol.)\n* Ola/Uber have postpaid wallets that you can pay cabs through and refill at your leisure.",

Your head is at the level of outside passing trucks wheels, you can\u2019t see anything you get no views, as a woman it puts you at easier greater risk of being groped or harrassed, even your belongings potentially pilfered.  Upper berth - you\u2019re above the traffic, you have great views, it\u2019s just safer in general all-round.  *And, I always book a double for just myself it\u2019s so cheap anyway lol*.  Much more comfort in a double.",

I would suggest getting yourself a double berth as they would be more comfortable. The online apps and sites also block men from booking any double berths that already has one seat booked by a woman btw, though I doubt you would want to share, just info in case you are booking last minute and there aren't many seats available.",

I'm sorry that this is something that still a thing :( If the place is like a shack or something where people are drinking and partying a lot say in Goa, it's best to not drink too much and to watch what you drink. The tip I suggested in my main post about booking tickets for historical places online and skipping queues is the for sure the best way to go I'd say. \n\nIf you would rather not stand out, I would suggest simple loose and comfortable clothing (Google kurta and salwar. They are traditional tops worn by women) and masks are pretty much an accessory now. If you want to, you can add a scarf as well. \n\nSouth India can get hella humid and hot btw, best to get some sunscreen that's not too sticky. If you are coming during the monsoon season, best to get umbrellas or raincoats. Don't buy umbrellas in the tiny shops you find in tourist places, they barely last a day. Carry a water bottle if you can and make sure it's filled. Some places can get really hot, I could barely enjoy Jaisalmer because of how dehydrated I got. Would definitely drink more water the next time I go. \n\nIndia can be a great place with lots of helpful people, but as it is with most places, people can be bad :(. I am sure if there any Indian women here, they could give better advice than me.\n\nEdit: If you end up going to Varkala in Kerala, give Cafe Sarwaa a visit. That place has my heart.\n\nEdit 2: Check out Shenaz Treasury on Instagram. She travels a lot by herself and I remember seeing some reels from her regarding traveling solo as a female in India.",

Also even if you couldn't get a reservation for the train, you can always get general tickets from the station for most trains and travel in general class or try your luck with the ticket examiner in other classes.",

HOWEVER, it is perfectly doable. It\u2019s not that bad once you get the hang of it. You just need patience, and when on vacation, it\u2019s easy to be patient.\n\nCrime is not that bad in India. Even at night, I rarely felt unsafe. Finding a rickshaw is extremely easy when you\u2019re near transport hubs (airport or train station). And keep in mind that getting \u201cripped off\u201d by a rickshaw driver is not the end of the world\u2026they\u2019ll charge you 500 rupees for a ride that should cost 250 rupees. You\u2019ll be annoyed but you\u2019ll survive.\n\nThe #1 piece of advice that I wish I had (and I didn\u2019t see anywhere online before I went) is to MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN INDIAN PHONE NUMBER! It\u2019s critical for reserving train tickets, plane tickets, sometimes even hotel rooms. That said, I spent a month there with no Indian phone number and still managed. If you miss your train, there\u2019s always another one, you\u2019ll just need to wait. And English is pretty common so you\u2019ll generally always be able to find someone who can explain things to you.\n\nSo, be prepared, but don\u2019t skip India if you really want to go. It\u2019s the hardest place I\u2019ve ever been but also one of the most rewarding. Literally unforgettable.",

You're going to have an amazing time. \n\nI would actually keep your travel plans loose. Trying to stay on a tightly controlled itinerary is just going to cause needless stress. \n\nMy immediate advice though is don't go straight for Varanasi. Southern India is way more relaxed and a lot easier to take in at first. Delhi and Varanasi are kinda nuts, and can be overwhelming for even experienced travelers. Consider starting in Bangalore or Kochi instead then hitting up the north. \n\nAlso it's really hard to travel around the north without some kind of local guide. Try to find one you like and they can help keep other touts away too. \n\nBut whatever you do, stay away from those \"tourist offices\" in Delhi. They'll push you into a bunch of overpriced stuff. Stay at a hostel and ask them for advice for respectable tourism companies.\n\nEdit - one last tip, if you're not a vegetarian, become one for the duration of your India trip. Your stomach will thank you.",

You'll have most of your really amazing adventures by randomly meeting people and stumbling into stuff: hostels are your friend for this. I'd have a 'bucket list' of stuff that you want to do, and plan out your first few days to get your bearings, but build in some squishiness beyond that. \n\nWikitravel can give you a good idea of the common scams in a given area / stuff to look out for, and that's just part of the experience. It's certainly a 'challenging' place to travel, but also massively rewarding. \n\nThere's a great vlog series by a dude called StrayBob who walked across southern India that's worth checking out: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mTUL5i6KfE&amp;list=PL7vljzHdbsPFicIkpnGxSOUtWfoXkGP4t&amp;index=2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mTUL5i6KfE&amp;list=PL7vljzHdbsPFicIkpnGxSOUtWfoXkGP4t&amp;index=2)",

Mostly everybody speaks English so that wouldn't be that big an issue. Start in Kerala - kochi/alleppey, move to ooty/Nilgiris come down to Tamil Nadu and travel up. \n\nPlease get a guide for North India! Or better book through an authentic private travel agency. Goa could come in between(your itinerary) when you need to relax and unwind. No guides necessary for Goa because at this point you would be able to navigate through scammers easily. Book all trains in advance, like months in advance and try to get the AC tiers. Try to avoid road side food stalls at least for the first week. In terms of budget, book hotels near the city centre rather than the airport. Hostels are usually fine but hotels with less than 300-400 google reviews are a red signal. If you're unsure, book taxis from the hotel reception - it would be relatively expensive but safer. Ola(app)is great. You can get swiggy(app)for food delivery. \n\nDo not be worried, India is beautiful and will welcome you!",

Once when talking to one of my aunts who lives in a smaller town and hasn't encountered white people before except for tourists, I realised she thought all white people had matted, braided hair, smoked weed and walked around with large backpacks.",

            "comment": "Hey I did India last year - albeit with a friend - and I imagine you\u2019ll probably be alright. Landing in Delhi late shouldn\u2019t be an issue. If you are really concerned with safety or missing something, Uber is available pretty widely in Delhi (and in most cities) and can be used easily. Just spend some time in the terminal once you land to get it set up. Taxis and autorickshaws are also fine and your travel experience seems to indicate you know what you\u2019ll need to do in terms of setting a price ahead of time, cash only, and not indicating anything to a driver that says you don\u2019t have a booking or believing them if they say your hotel is closed or some BS. \n\nIntercity trains generally will take a bit more planning. There are websites that will show you how full each train is by class. I think if you just Google Indian railway bookings, you will find a search option that will show you how many seats are left on each. In these cases, some may be booked or on waitlist. Depending on the number of trains per day and how much time you have to book, it may require some flexibility on the front end. The harder part will be booking. Generally I found that tickets couldn\u2019t really be booked by foreigners except for at train ticket offices. There were foreigner windows at some stations but when I went they were still all closed post-pandemic. They might be open now. Either way, we went to hostel owners for help with train tickets and that worked every time. Just know what train and class you want and they can book it for you if there is space. They will likely charge a nominal service fee but I assure you it\u2019ll be worth doing that instead of waiting for hours at the booking window at a station. I don\u2019t know if hotels will do this for you so you may want to call if you\u2019re doing hotels all through the trip. Booking is generally pretty doable even a day or two before travel but if you know where you want to go and when ahead of time, no harm getting the ticket as early as possible. \n\nAs for tours and stuff like that, if you\u2019re insistent on getting something that\u2019s more organized I\u2019d really just say to go through Viator or Trip Advisor to something with a few legit reviews. Never ran into a place or thing in India that truly had no reviewed tours when I wanted to take one. Make sure you\u2019re set with your WhatsApp ahead of time because that\u2019s how most communication is going to be done with those. \n\nAs for scammers, it\u2019s going to be present and it\u2019s going to be constant. You\u2019re going to be hassled especially in larger cities. Just be aware of that. Keep your belongings safe like anywhere else and get comfortable ignoring people outright or telling people to fuck off if it\u2019s too in your face. I was super put off at first but generally you just get over it after a certain point. Regarding safety, trust your gut. It\u2019s like anywhere else in that regard. \n\nIn all, I\u2019d really say just to relax. It\u2019s going to be extremely chaotic and no amount of planning is going to change that. Be as flexible as you can be with travel times if you\u2019re going by train or bus. Use a train time tracker to see where your train is so you know you didn\u2019t miss anything. Check the boards at train stations. Trust your hotel/hostel folks if they\u2019re well reviewed. All in all I think India is a super rewarding experience but you really need to let go a little bit in terms of being in control. It\u2019s just how it is.",

            "comment": "India is a frustrating country to visit if you aren\u2019t used to how things work there. People will absolutely try to scam you, but you will get used to ignoring them. But like you said, even something extremely simple other places, will be very difficult there. Sometimes it\u2019s because you don\u2019t know the easiest option (for example, don\u2019t book your Ranthanbore safari yourself because it is difficult and confusing, instead, stay at a reputable hotel and email them before to ask them to book for you).  Another example is that paying with a foreign card or trying to book something online without an India phone # can be difficult. There are many things like this you\u2019ll learn as you go. If you plan before you go, you won\u2019t spend as much time while in India figuring it out. \n\nBecause of a train delay, I ended up taking the unreserved car, so that is an option\u2026 but would not recommend for a long journey. This was in Jaipur so I don\u2019t know if you can do it in Delhi, I heard the same that Delhi trains need advance booking so I ended up taking a bus when I visited Delhi. Buses are a great way to travel, they have a range of options from AC sleepers to public buses if you\u2019re on a budget. But you should always expect to be delayed by 1-2 hours going anywhere\u2026 though it can be much longer.\n\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t do much research and just figured things out when I arrived. It meant I spent hours of my trip trying to figure certain things out. My biggest advice would be to try to ask someone local about the best way to do xyz (book a train, take a safari, visit certain places etc). You can call your hotel in advance, or ask the airbnb owner, call the attraction, etc. Every time I did that, it was so much simpler than trying to figure it out myself.\n\nAlso fwiw I went out at night regularly with no issues, though of course that is very location dependent. I would just be aware of your surrounding and look into areas to stay that are more lively. I did avoid going out in Delhi, so I can\u2019t speak to how it is there. But I felt safe in Bangalore, Jaipur, and smaller cities when I stayed centrally.",

Important trick is to check from where the train leaves, if it leaves 10 cities before it gets to ur stop then theres a good chance itll be very delayed. Try to book ones that start their journey at ur city or a few hours earlier in a nearby city.\n\nI think you dont need to stress too much about planning, most small issues can be solved with a little cash. \n\nRemember \"the journey is the destination\" ;) IMO for india simply being there and experiencing the chaos in the highest population makes it worth it. As for the scammers and pushy people youll inevitably meet, dont take it to heart too much, they live a different life and are just trying to make an easy buck",

It's a very interesting place, lots of good and lots of bad, so prepare yourself for that. \n\nMy dad always says there are 10 Indias, which one are you talking about? And I'm inclined to agree. Tons of geographical differences, loads of languages and dialects, each region has totally different food, you can go religious like Varanasi or find a brewery every 3 kms in Bangalore, obscenely rich people and crippling poverty. It's very intense and extreme but it'll probably push you to grow. \n\nAs a woman, I believe the cons outweigh the pros as a resident. But to travel, it's very worth it. \n\nI'd be happy to show you around if you're in Bangalore! There's not much to see - breweries, parks, old school bookstores, some monuments, very delicious local food. But the areas around Bangalore are super nice - Karnataka (where Bangalore is located) is known for wildlife and tigers, Mysore and Hampi in particular are rich in history, Coorg and Chikmagalur have tons of natural beauty, so there's stuff to do around the main city. \n\nMumbai and Bangalore are good for acclimatisation. Be careful in Delhi! \n\nSafe travels! Be careful while crossing the road :)",

            "comment": "I think you are overthinking it a little bit to be honest. Yes, planning goes a long way in India especially if you are trying to do a lot of things because it is quite a large and diverse country.\n\nComing to your query about the hotels around Delhi airport, even if they are located right on the periphery of the airport, sometimes it will take time to reach them depending on where you exit the airport and such. To be honest, I'm not very familiar with Delhi airport but from my experience of Mumbai airport, there are a ton of hotels right outside the airport but you do need 5-10 mins to get to them in a cab just because of the routes considering these are huge international airports.\n\nI don't know where you are reading that the trains are usually very late. That's not true at all. Yes, sometimes there are delays, especially in trains that run super long distances but usually Indian railways is very dependable. Regarding the tickets, they can sell out quickly but you may be able to avail of tatkal bookings which reserve tickets for last minute travelers for a slightly higher fare (which will be negligible for you since you're coming from Europe)\n\nRegarding scammers, again that's entirely untrue, not everyone is trying to scam you, at least not in the manner that you find in Egypt or Morocco. Hawkers and vendors can be annoyingly persistent so you have to learn to be firm with them. Once in a while a taxi or autorickshaw may try to charge you a gringo rate but this can be avoided by using rideshare apps like Uber/Ola especially metros like Delhi.\n\nTiger safaris are one of the best things to do in India imo. They one you'll definitely have to put in some time to research though because as you can imagine, the best national parks are located deep in the interiors so you need to figure out your logistics in advance.\n\nOverall, I'd say you're being a little paranoid, its only June and you have plenty of time to figure out a 2-3 week trip in October/November. That will actually be a great time to visit because the monsoons will be over, Diwali is in the second week of November and the cricket world cup is happening in October/November so it's going to be a totally festive atmosphere.\n\nIndia is the most incredible of places, just have a little flexibility in your schedule and an open mind and it'll be an experience like no other.",

The blogs you're reading are overstating the amount of planning one can do in India.\n\nObviously you can advance book hotels via booking.com, Expedia, Hostelworld etc. A lot of businesses in India will have WhatsApp business numbers you can contact for quicker replies. Either WhatsApp or calling is the best method. And for pricing, you can always shop around so you're not getting the short end of the stick. \n\nFor transit, I'd say not to worry. Booking trains through the apps can be challenging as people tend to book seats (even if they don't intend on taking the train) as there's little to no penalty for last minute cancellations. Talk to the ticketing office in advance at the train station to secure a tourist quota ticket. They'll have a set # of tickets reserved for foreigners on the popular routes. That's saved my ass on many occasions.\n\nFor driving, Uber is your friend. Don't bother negotiating with regular cabs unless they're within the realm of what the Uber price is. \n\nIf you've got any questions, feel free to DM me. Happy to help!",

To fit in Varanasi (Benares) &amp; a Nat park tour in only 2 weeks, it\u2019s a challenge.  Everything in India moves in slow motion at full blast.  To go directly to Varanasi on arrival, it\u2019s really tough - it takes a few days to a couple weeks to even start getting over the culture shock.  I\u2019d advise, how about this, the other way around -- NatPark tour first, Varanasi last.  For eg arrive Delhi stay the night arrange for the next day train (or sleeper bus) to Rajasthan Pushkar (a few hours from Jaipur).  \n\n I advise everyone (those who arrive in Delhi) first time India to go direct to Pushkar.  It\u2019s an ancient small fairytale pilgrims town on a holy lake, and old hippy/freaks hangout since a few decades a bit more upmarket trendy these days.  It\u2019s where they do the famous camel fair every year.  (Omg it might be on when you arrive - check the dates!)  Anyways, it\u2019s small &amp; friendly town plenty locals speak English &amp; a bits of a few other languages,, many foreign-traveller oriented gust houses funky cafes &amp; restaurants, you can walk around the whole town in an hour, so it\u2019s a great place to ease into India &amp; get over the initial shock. \n\n From there Ranthanbore isn\u2019t so far, you can even get tours for Ranthanbore NatPark + Jaipur 4 nights 5-days.  So, you go Pushkar a few days, meet yr Ranthanbore tour, have your flight Jaipur - Varanasi booked already so then you fly to Varansi for a few days, back to Delhi, and home. \n\nYeah there are scammers, yeah it\u2019s tough - but you\u2019ll manage.  Dozens of people will want to shake your hand ask your name or take yr photo with them \u201cjust one snap\u201d - say firmly &amp; friendly NO THANK YOU and KEEP WALKING.  Touts, beggars, bazaar salesmen, whoever - smile but just ignore them don\u2019t stop don\u2019t even talk to them, and KEEP WALKING - with only 2 weeks you don\u2019t have time for that.  And it's not as bad as Morocco for eg.  Street food is amazing - if there are clean-looking family-type people eating there - it\u2019s safe enough.  But watch out - local food is SPICY haha.  And watch out in Benares - everybody gets stomach issues in Benares.  Oh, and Varanasi, &amp; Pushkar, they\u2019re holy towns, so alcohol is not allowed.  It\u2019s a REALLY bad idea to drink alcohol around most of India anyway, in general.  \n\nomg have a great trip!",

Find the ones having 4 or 5 star ratings and send them an email. They can plan a whole trip for you and for a very reasonable price. A car with a driver in India would cost you less than renting a car in European cities. I would suggest you do Delhi, Agra and Rajasthan (Jaipur, Udaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Chittorgarh) and the tour agency can plan your itinerary for you as well as hotels. Once you are set up with them, they will pick you from airport and take you around till its your time to leave. In many places your driver is also your guide so you can have a safe travel experience without being scammed. Try this and you will thank me later",

There are details and advice on these areas in the OZZI app. Here\u2019s a screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/8ICr4N7 \r\n\r\nYour concerns are not misplaced, and it is never \u2018stupid\u2019 to worry.

It is a different place to any other I have been to, good and bad. \n\nFirst of, I never felt unsafe, other than that one time getting stopped by armed police on a deserted road while riding a motorbike. They wanted money, thats all. Paid \"fines\" in more than one country, thats for sure. \n\nIt is so long ago I cant advice on current booking system etc. But, expect to be overwhelmed and just keep calm. I say India is a punch to the stomach that you enjoy. \n\nBe assertive, clear, dont let people take over the situation even if you might offend a helpful soul. You will get scammed, but it is peanuts in the grand scale of things. You will be misinformed, but it will work out. You will get frustrated, but getting angry does not help. \n\nI went around on a flow, without a bigger plan than a number of town I wanted to get to. Sorted itself out by train, plane or cab. \n\nI spend a couple of days making the average monthly salery in India. That does not mean I want to waste money, but it does mean the price of getting a cab for a day isnt really a big deal. Most of us can do things like that in a pinch whenever you are stuck somewhere. Just saying.\n\nEnjoy your trip, it will be something you will remember forever!",

It was late, probably 2am. I went back to my to my hotel to find it was locked and no one answered. I got  worried. Varanasi is weird, probably even for Indian people. I didnt know what to do and I didnt have cell service, because of Indian bureaucracy is intense.  And then I just walked around until I found another hotel and paid $10 to stay a night. The moral of the story is: in India there is always a way. It might not be a comfortable way, but you can get by.\n\nDont worry, enjoy your trip.",

Men can be aggressive and will try to come on to you and will often try to get a grope in, especially in crowded areas.  Theft is also rampant, so yes you must stay very vigilant.   Female friends I met when traveling there were doing well, but experienced all of the above and more, but did well overall because they had each other to look out for the other.  Traveling in a pair made it easier.  \n\nSome tips I can share is book hotels in advance and if your budget allows, nicer hotels are worth it as they have trusted transportation, especially to/from travel hubs.  Just call the hotel and request.   You will also be able to store your items securely and not worry when you go out and explore.   \n\nFor travel around the country, I suggest flying.  It\u2019s reliable and not expensive.  Traveling on trains is an experience, but you don\u2019t need to travel long to get the experience under your belt.  I suggest a shorter round trip like Delhi to Agra to get the experience but fly after.  \n\nFinally, if you have a friend to travel with I suggest doing that.  India is an amazing place but very overwhelming and challenging location to explore.  Experiencing it with a friend makes it a more rich and safe experience.",

I've had people follow me walking for literal miles, talking, begging, threatening but I just put on my headphones and kept walking ignoring them. Everyone who seemed friendly sooner or later in the conversation ended up asking for money in some way. If somebody asks you where you're going and they tell you the road is closed, the place closed down, there's a shortcut, ignore them. Hotel owners always tried to force me into rating them 5 stars, so disregard scoring and read comments. I never felt phisically threatened or in danger, it's just absolutely exhausting, I'd like to remark this. You'll be safe, you won't be mugged or assaulted or whatever (except for the monkeys), but you'll have to have your guard up. Always use bottled water, and make peace with the fact that you'll have diahorrea several times, and bring medication along accordingly.  Finally, accept that at some point you will be scammed and it'll be liberating. I was hyper vigilant for a month and a half and got scammed twice and at first I was frustrated but then started looking at it as if I had avoided being scammed 998 times and just accepted it.",

I'm a white middle-aged American, so I was probably close to 40 when I there. \n\nI'd plan on hanging around the airport, but that depends on how much time you'll have until your next flight. \n\nI liked Varanasi. I spent a lot of time there. I've never seen more dead bodies. It's surreal sitting in traffic and the rickshaw next to you has a corpse on top that the family is taking to be burned. \n\nIn Varanasi, I saw the movie Singh is King about 3 times. See Indian movies and sit in the cheap seats.  They'll try to talk you into the good seats but don't. People laugh and cheer and boo. It's wonderful. Plus during the intermission you can buy outside food. Same with seeing a cricket match even if you don't like cricket or sports. \n\nLearn how to wash your butt with your left hand and a cup of water if you haven't done that before. You'll be doing that a lot. It was nice for me to not be one of the tourists that spend a ton of time trying to find toilet paper. \n\nBuy the UN electrolyte packages and have a few on you at all times. When you get sick, you'll be glad you have them. \n\nMost of the people you'll deal with as a tourist see you as an ATM. No one ever thinks about income disparity so you're viewed as a very wealthy person touring even if you worked minimum wage jobs for 3 years to save money to visit India. \n\nI don't really plan much. And it's India so getting one thing you want to do in a day is a win. Take your time and talk to people. You'll be invited into shops for chai all the time. They're doing that to sell you something. Some people get angry if you go in for chai and don't buy anything even if they lured you in with the calling of \"Have some chai, no need to buy\".\n\nSometimes going out to get a bottle of water becomes a journey that can take 5 hours. Learn to love it. \n\nThe dog packs at night aren't a joke, but don't be scared of the dark. A fake wallet is a good idea. \n\nIt's a wonderful country with some of the best food in the world.",

Most places you get off a bus or train there will always be lines of tuk's tuk's waiting to get business even in the middle of the night, just make sure you get off in a central area, otherwise ask your hotel to organise you something. The good thing about india is that almost everywhere you go.. there will always be alot of people around, and that always made me feel safe. \n\nAs crazy as india can be, it is the most fascinating country with the most beautiful people and culture. The key is to 'surrender' to everything, accept it for what it is, treat it as an experience. India is it's own world, don't compare it to your other holidays! Also ry to avoid just doing the typical 'golden triangle'.. most people do only that and walk away saying they dislike india - it doesn't represent the country whatsoever. If you're already in the north, try to get up to Parvati Valley and trek through the villages.. the relaxed mountain life will make you fall in love!\n\nGood luck!!! You'll be fine :)",

But if you prepare for the worst you won't be disappointed and you'll have a decent experience. \n\nI didn't find India unsafe, but really frustrating. By far the most inconvenient destination I've been to (after 60 countries). I had a long rant about it, you can check it on my profile. I didn't really get any useful info to avoid the bad stuff, it's gonna be part of the experience. \n\nUse the apps they recommended, but even with them you won't have a \"western comfort\" experience. The worst are the hotels on booking. Yes, they lie about everything. Yes, even the reviews lie.",

Sometimes sublime , sometimes it will make you burn with a rage you didnt know you were capable of! \n\nI\u2019ll probably be downvoted to oblivion but here\u2019s some advice (I\u2019ve been three times for a total of almost 2 years) \n\n1 In the cities in particular, get ready for lies , lots of lies , dont believe your hotel is shut down/train is cancelled etc. It\u2019s just a scam to get you to get their \u2018friends\u2019 hotel or travel agent who can magically save you while also getting them a cut on the noob they sent.\n\n2 Be ultra careful with the water. I had dysentery twice , cryptosporidium and plenty dodgy bellies. You\u2019ll be got eventually , hygiene isn\u2019t anywhere close to any western country. Often times you\u2019ll see absolutely filthy food stalls for yourself so obviously avoid them. Just be aware and try and get a course of ciprofloxacin and some immodium before you go for when the shit hits the fan.\n\n3 Look out for your fellow travelers, particularly the solo traveling women. I met a lot who had some bad experiences with , let\u2019s say very \u2018handsy\u2019 local guys. \n\nSorry if I offended anyone here. India is spectacular. I had some of the best experiences of my life there. From food to history to landscapes and more ,  it has it all. I\u2019ll go again happily , but I do think that\u2019s sound advice above. Have a blast friend , don\u2019t worry about it , you\u2019ll love it. Just be aware that sometimes itll drive you crazy. But it\u2019s totally worth it in the long run",

Of course, if you don't put the effort in to figure out how much things cost, you'll get scammed at some point- westerners are walking ATMs to the third world- but it's really not that hard to do that.  \nJust go and think on your feet- that's the whole point of backpacking- the growth.

Generally flights can be booked for the next day at a good price. Trains are quite reliable. Phone service is cheapest in the world and works. \n\nAnd as a 31 year old male, I don't see any reason to be afraid at night. India is not a dangerous place, and the streets tends to be full of people, so not much can happen.\n\nIn general, I would steer away from poor places and very touristy places, since that's where you'll find unpleasant characters, taxi mafias, etc. But in most of India (outside of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Goa, Rishikesh), things work pretty seamlessly (at least for a foreigner willing to pay $5 for a 1 hour Uber ride) and people are friends and helpful.\n\nAdvice: \n\nWhen you get to the airport, get UPI to be able to make phone payments. That's how must payments are done in India (even for a $0.12 tea at a stall) and foreigners can ONLY access it at the airport.\n\nGet phone service the first day before you try any significant excursions - despite what you may read online, it's not hard and can be done in the moment at the Airtel etc. store (NOT in the airport).\n\nAirBnBs with an Indian family can be better than hotels, especially to get a bit acclimated at the beginning. \"Homestays\" on Booking and Agoda are generally just regular small hotels. \n\nFor booking buses, go directly to the bus company website - e.g. HRTC for Himachal, CTU for Chandigarh. Those tend to be the best options and bus aggregators miss any of them.\n\nYou can generally book auto rickshaws with Uber and Ola - always do so if possible. If you MUST get one off the street, at least see what Uber would charge.",

I travel a lot, so am naturally vigilant all the time.\n\nAfter Kerala, I flew to Jaipur.

My hostel in Jaipur arranged a taxi to Agra and even found two others who wanted to share it with me. Total cost was $39, which is really reasonable for a 6 hour drive and complete sense of safety. My share was $13.\n\nIn Agra, again, used accommodation to hire trusted rickshaw drivers. And they booked my taxi up to Delhi. Another long ride, about 4 hours, but the cost was about $35\u2026so reasonable to avoid the stress of safety, missing trains, what to do when you arrive, etc. \n\nThey do use Uber, so you can use the app, or rely on you accommodation to help.",

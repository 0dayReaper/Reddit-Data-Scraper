    "postText": "I\u2019m travelling solo for the first time in Japan, I\u2019ve been here for about 10 days but my first week was spent staying with a family friend.\n\nMy first night staying in a hostel was yesterday which was fine, but today I met this guy who I can\u2019t seem to shake. For some context, I\u2019m 20 years old &amp; female and he looks to be about mid 30s.\n\nHe approached me as we\u2019re staying in the same dorm, and, as it turns out we\u2019re the only two staying in this dorm. He seemed friendly at first, it was hard to gauge as there\u2019s a big language barrier. At around 6PM he asked me to go for a walk so I did and then he took me to a restaurant and insisted on buying me dinner. I said no as I\u2019d already eaten but I went with him to eat.\n\nWhen we were sitting down it just felt off, I got weird vibes from him. He also said quite a few racist things, so I ended up excusing myself from the dinner with the excuse that I was feeling unwell.\n\nI got back to the hostel and went to rest, when he came back he came straight to the dorm room and asked if I was feeling better and wanted to do something. I said no, I\u2019m going to bed, so he went to bed too. This was about 7 PM. fyi - I only said I was going to bed to avoid him.\n\nIt\u2019s now 8.30 and he obviously knows I\u2019m awake and says my name every 25  minutes or so to check, he keeps trying to talk to me and asking if I want to stay awake with him.\n\nShould I be worried? Am I being paranoid? Reception has already left. Can I do anything? Is this the norm?\n\n\nEdits - details.\n\nUpdate - I\u2019ve moved to the common room and he didn\u2019t follow or say anything. I\u2019m going to wait out here for now, there is someone else here from another dorm but reception is gone, there is a capsule hotel nearby that I\u2019m sussing out.\n\nThank you all for your help \u2764\ufe0f\n\nUpdate: So I met someone in the common room and alerted them of the situation, they had a spare bed in their dorm so I slept there for the night, and when I woke up this morning the guy was gone, as well as all of his stuff, so I think he\u2019s checked out.:)\n\nI can\u2019t thank you all enough for your help and advice! Truly means the world to me. \u2764\ufe0f",

I'd go for the \"fuck off\" option but I have no patience for shitty men's egos in need of coddling. The safest is probably strict avoidance but that does come at an economic cost. \n\nRegardless, the thing that always makes me feel a bit better in this (frequent) scenario is to hear someone else commiserate.

Next time he says your name tell him \"I told you no once, and you need to respect that.  Stop checking on me, I don't want to spend time with you again.\"  If he doesn't take the hint (and tbh, probably even if he does) go to the hostel reception and tell them that there's a guy who has latched on to you and won't leave you alone.\n\nWorst case scenario, you'll have to move hostels tomorrow.\n\nEta: thread locked so I can't respond but to all those saying 'but creeps can get violent' - yeah,I know.

Hostels are full of different people and some of them don't know how to interact with other in a proper way.\n  \nThat being said if you're feeling uncomfortable with that person around, the reception must have a number for emergencies, or late check in. Call them and ask them to move you to a different room.  \n  \n  \nOr like others have said just move out for the night.",

Maybe at some point randomly mention this dude and see if others know him or how they judge him. Maybe they'll comfort you in saying he's ok. Or if they find him weird as well, then maybe see if someone else has a spare bed in their room that you could spend the night in.\n\nThen in the morning, go talk to reception, they are there to help and definitely will do so. They can move you to another room (a room with some people you've met already and trust more?) or at least check when this dude is moving out. If you're lucky, this might be his last night at this hostel, you never know.\n\nI doubt reception will refund you your night, but they definitely will do everything they can to ensure you have a nice stay!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT/ No idea where you're at, but I would always recommend - if possible - to stay at hostels that are part of the Hostelling International network.

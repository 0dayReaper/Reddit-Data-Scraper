    "postText": "Hi, as the title suggests will be going to Vietnam for a couple of weeks, travelling south to north. Generally not as interested in big cities and want to experience more of the natural beauty, good food, and local culture. This is my itinerary at the moment:\n\n1. Fly into Ho Chi Minh and stay there for a couple of nights. Do a walking tour and explore the street food scene. \n\n2. Fly to Da Nang then head straight to Hoi An for 4 days. Do a cooking class, boat trip through the lanterns, explore the markets, and just generally chill out on the beach. \n\n3. Fly to Hanoi for a few days, explore the city a little and do a day tour to Ha Long Bay. \n\n4. Do a 3 day Ha Giang loop tour. \n\n5. Back to Hanoi for a couple of days to check out anything I didn\u2019t have time for earlier and then fly out. \n\nAny tips / guidance much appreciated!",

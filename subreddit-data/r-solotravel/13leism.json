    "postText": "Hello all.\nI booked a trip to Atlanta a couple months back. The date of the trip is approaching.\n\nHere\u2019s my issue. To say the least my parents aren\u2019t exactly the most accepting when it comes to me traveling, specifically my mom. I have before yes\u2026but my parents are always left um upset for whatever reason and I can sense this would be the case too right now. They want to travel with me to Ecuador in July and will see something wrong with me just going to ATL (even though it\u2019s my own money and I haven\u2019t traveled this year at all).\n\nHow do I break it down to them this time, more specifically as it is a solo trip instead of with friends?",

It's good to tell *someone* in your life where you're traveling but it doesn't have to be your parents if they aren't able to handle the fact that you want to travel.\n\nIf you do live with them, and you're an adult, it might be good to have a chat with them about boundaries and respecting your right to make your own decisions, especially when it's travel that you're financing yourself.\n\nI live in Atlanta so feel free to reach out if you have questions about the city. Happy travels!",

I\u2019ve done solo trips all across America and Canada, and have traveled outside the country a decent bit. \n\nLet me start with asking what their concerns are? Where will you be staying? Will you be with friends, and are they locals? Where are you coming from? Will you have a car?\n\nI\u2019m happy to dispel any rumors and give you lots of recommendations if you let me know what you\u2019re interested in seeing and doing here. It\u2019s a lovely city, full of trees, parks, music, and great food. It\u2019s not perfect, but with a little finesse, you can have a magnificent time here. Feel free to DM me and I\u2019ll spill all the beans on fun stuff to do!",

Let's just say they watch a lot of Fox News and indulge in \"alternative news sources\".\n\nUnfortunately, there's no magic bullet. Assuming you don't live with them, you've got to just do you. Take the trip, assure them that you've done your due diligence in searching crime maps (I assume they have a misconception of crime in major cities) and just go for it.\n\nMy mom has chilled out a lot since I first started traveling in 2018. She had a multi hour full on panic attack when I told her I was going to Europe last year, but at least this time she didn't beg me to download a tracker app (don't bend to that, by the way).\n\nBest of luck.",

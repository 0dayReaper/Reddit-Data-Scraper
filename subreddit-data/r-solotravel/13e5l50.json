    "postText": "I am tossing up whether I splash out on a new phone for travel purely for a new camera and storage.\n\nI currently have a 60gb iPhone 12 and am looking at upgrading to a 14 with double the storage. Just wondering if people think it made a difference to them.\n\nI personally would like to have the better quality photos and am not about to splash out on a new camera. However, am also aware of the risk of it getting stolen or broken etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I have cloud storage, but it annoys me how everything goes onto the cloud and requires internet to view/access things that have been stored on there. I still find the phone runs slowly from always being at full cap. ",

The photos are incredible, especially the nighttime shots (like of volcanoes erupting \ud83d\ude0d). Everyone I met along the way wanted me to send them my photos. To me, this money was so well spent on the trip, giving me better pictures and memories.\n\nI don\u2019t think the theft risk is any higher with a more recent model of a phone (unless you\u2019re going from REALLY old to latest), thieves see an iPhone and snatch it. So just get insurance or bring the old one too as back up.",

I just took a picture yesterday that I plan to print on a 30cm x 40cm canvas when I get home and hang it on my wall. My mom loves the photo too and also wants a print :) \n\nI went from a pixel 3 to a pixel 7pro. All the photos automatically upload to Google photos at full resolution so I won't lose them if I lose the phone. \n\nAnd the picture is of a shaggy long haired highland ox named Samson.",

I wanted to get some good videos of the concert and really was due for a new phone soon anyway. I'm really glad I did. Night time pics are much better than my old phone.  I'm annoyed Samsung no longer has the SD card option but was very pleased that the new phone basically copied everything off my old phone. I got 256 gb of storage because I like to keep my pics easily accessible on my phone without having to access any clouds/needing internet (and having to pay for storage).",

It\u2019s worth it for the extra piece of mind. So is paying for more storage up front. Yes, you COULD upload everything frequently but do you really want to be taken out of the moment to quickly try to delete stuff?\n\nI\u2019ll also add to get the Apple Card if you don\u2019t already have it. It\u2019s my favourite credit card in general but also you get 3% cash back from any Apple purchases (including the iPhone itself, the Apple care, the iCloud storage plan, etc.) and they offer 0% payment plans if that helps your budgeting. Even if you choose the payment plans for your iphone, the full 3% of the cost of the phone gets credited as cash back up front.",

I do plan on getting a better iPhone before my next big trip, but hopefully much before so it feels less \u00ab\u00a0new\u00a0\u00bb and I can catch a good sale (I would have upgraded like 5 days before I left if I did!)",

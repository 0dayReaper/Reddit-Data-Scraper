            "comment": "I'm planning a solo trip there later this year, and will be spending most of the trip in Malaysian Borneo. My impression is that some of the national parks, etc. are best seen on tours, and some of those tours don't offer spots to solo travelers (for example some of the longer cave tours in Mulu National Park) - I would welcome any stories from people who've been there solo and whether you had any issues finding tour guides friendly to solo travelers, or whether it was easy enough to add yourself in to existing group tours on arrival there.",

So if you want, you can book the activity the night before or even on the morning of. I did one of the cave tours and I think there were 8 of us in total, 3 couples and myself and a friend. There may be a minimum number of pax required but you could register your interest one or two days prior to increase your chances of the cave tour. \n\nI saw solo travelers there and was glad that it's not one of those places where a minimum of 2 is needed to sign up for an activity. \n\nI stayed in the park and it was a good choice. Those who stayed at the Marriott had to wait for transport to pick them up in the morning and at the end of the day.",

The orangutan rehabilitation centre and the sun bear sanctuary are fab and the Rainforest Discovery Centre has some of the best birdwatching I've ever experienced. All of these can be accessed easily via Grab from Sandakan.   \n\n\n\n2) Langkawi, and in particular Kuah, which doesn't have a beach and is therefore much quieter. I spent days photographing and filming dusky leaf monkeys, huge 2m+ monitor lizards, white-bellied eagles, Brahminy kites, black giant squirrels and so much more just in a random park outside our hotel.",

Amazing experience and every Friday, the owner who renovated the house gives a very interesting tour through the house. \n- Cameron Highlands. We stayed in Ipoh and took a private taxi there, it's about a 2h drive even though its only 90km, because it's a 1 lane road and the road is super curvy. Ipoh has a beautiful temple that's worth a visit (Sam Poh Tong), but apart from these two things we didn't really feel like Ipoh is a must see, and you could also visit the Cameron Highlands from another location. \n- KL is amazing, so much to do and see, great food. I'd recommend 3 or 4 days minimum. \n\nAnother highlight was definitely the food!",

I have only visited it twice, first one as a transit from Cameron to Lumut (otw to Pangkor Island). But now, with the intercity train, it's more accessible. But it is kind of a sleeper town. If you like architecture, the old town offers a lot.\n\nMaybe it's time for me to revisit again.",

I believe this would be a great way to experience the culture and interact with the locals while working remotely and exploring the country.\n\nThe plan in to go there in mid Oct/early Nov, and find a place to stay in Malaysia, possibly in or near KL, for 3 months till January. From there, apart from exploring the country, the plan is to take 2 separate short trips to Singapore and Brunei during the weekends while on leave from work.\n\nStill have to decide on a variety of things and figure the entire structure out, but that's kind of the rough overview of the plan.\n\nAny suggestions, tips or recommendation would be appreciated as it'll be my first time there!",

It\u2019s become a much nicer place to spend a few days now.\n\nIn Penang, I second the Blue Manor recommendation. It\u2019s an atmosphere unlike any other, and frankly, THE highlight of visiting George Town.\n\nElsewhere, I\u2019d HIGHLY recommend The Datai in Langkawi - the setting is incomparable and the place truly is one of the worlds great resorts.

    "postText": "Hi everyone, \nIm currently in Cebu and I have a flight tomorrow to get to Manila. I have another flight Sunday night to fly to Vietnam.\nIm travelling alone and 0 experience with typhoons. Im struggling to find information online and stressing out about making the wrong choices. \n\nShould I take the flight to Manila hoping to get my flight to Vietnam on Sunday night (even though the Typhoon will be closed by that time). Or is it that obvious that my flight isn\u2019t gonna happen and I\u2019ll be stuck in Manila. \n\nIf not, I\u2019m able to fly out of Cebu tomorrow night to Kuala Lumpur and get to Vietnam afterwards. I have a safety budget of 500$ to deal with emergency. \n\nAnyone solo travelling in the Philippines right now that can share more info? \n\nThank you",

If you\u2019re only on vacation for a couple of weeks then it might be worth taking the earlier flight. \n\nI\u2019m on Palawan right now so not really concerned about the typhoon",

I\u2019m just going to continue my plans as normal, flight from cebu should hopefully go undisturbed and then sunday night when its time to fly from manila it should have passed through. \n\nI\u2019m told it will be bringing a monsoon though so some heavy downpour can be expected",

I believe there\u2019s an English translation / subtitles. Just like what everyone said, you should be fine. The typhoon is not hitting Manila although monsoon rains are expected. Good luck!",

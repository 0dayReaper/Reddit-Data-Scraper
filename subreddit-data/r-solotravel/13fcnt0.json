    "postText": "Hey there fellow travellers,\n\nSoon I will quit my job and take a couple of months off to travel solo again. I am thinking about my next destinations and as I have covered already lots of South East and East Asia, I thought travelling to Latin America, where I have only been to Nicaragua for a month and couple of weeks to Costa Rica. I don't really know any Spanish, besides some basic words. I thought about Columbia and Bolivia for a start and then make my way down south. Having been already to about 30 countries I am no beginner, but still I have my doubts about safety in these countries. E.g. in Nicaragua I never dared to take out my phone in public and on buses, so in the end it was fine.\nHow safe are Columbia and Bolivia nowadays for a 30 year old white guy with pale skin and blue eyes?\nDo I have to be constantly alert to not get mugged? I have heared, that neither the easily accessible beaches nor the food is world class in Columbia, so I would most likely be checking out the lost city, guatape, medellin and tayrona national park. Or would you recommend skipping the country and rather going to Peru, which is potentially safer?",

            "comment": "The safety levels of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia are quite similar. In my experience they are all more dangerous than Nicaragua, but not extremely. Following some street smarts you will be most likely reasonably safe in all of them. Make sure to know which areas are (un)safe. Try to learn more Spanish, it's super helpful.   \n\n\nIf you like beaches, Tayrona is great and there are some nice islands with beaches along the Caribbean coast too. La Guajira offers beaches on a desert coast. Beaches along the Pacific coast of South America are in general much worse.   \n\n\nYou should check more places in Colombia than the few ones you mention. The country is extremely varied and offers a lot. The food might be not world class, but it's not bad either. If you skip low end eateries there's plenty of nice reasonably priced places, with for example great steaks for $10 or less. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to go south, it makes sense to just follow the Andes range. Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia etc.   \n\n\n  \nBTW, Colombians really dislike calling their country Columbia.",

I'm joking. this should, but doesn't exist. \n\nwear a belt with a hidden zipper w. hidden cash or card.  hide cash or cards in other ways. \n\ndepending where you stay hide or protect your belongs there. use the hotel safe. put your bag inside a black contractor bag so it looks like rubbish (though, don't let anyone throw it out, jaja.)",

Colombia seems to be promoting tourism more, so it seems like they had more security around (ex: comuna 13, military check points on long bus routes). Bolivia I felt  safe in. Infrastructure (esp for tourism) isn't the best compared to other countries, but the people are friendly.",

Like someone else said, be prepared to be robbed so that if it happens you don't end up putting yourself at risk by resisting. Use a cheap phone and have a plan B as to how to acquire a new one just in case.\n\nAlso be careful if you're using tinder in Medell\u00edn as the girls are known to drug tourists and take them to ATMs.\n\nAs for Peru, last I heard the conditions there are still pretty unstable but you'd probably be fine. \n\nMy biggest concern in Bolivia would probably be the altitude lmao",

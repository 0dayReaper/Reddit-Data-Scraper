    "postText": "Norwegian cruise line offers studio staterooms designed for solo travelers. They\u2019re tiny 100 sq ft rooms with a full size bed, toilet, and shower. But there\u2019s a private lounge with a bar and snacks exclusively for the solo travelers. I understand they also have some sorts of special events just for the solo travelers. I booked one of these rooms on a cruise for early next year, and it seemed to be an exceptional bargain. If anybody has experience with these studio rooms on NCL, please comment on your experience. Thanks",

At least one other solo had done a studio suite on a previous cruise and she indicated that she felt safer as everyone gets to know each other over the course of the cruise.\n\nMake an effort to attend the Solo Traveler meeting on the first day. I ended up getting to know about a dozen people thru the solo travelers and we had a blast.",

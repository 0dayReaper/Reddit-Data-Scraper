Lots of people seem to have the idea that you need to be on a six month backpacking trip to be a \u201cserious traveler.\u201d That\u2019s great for some people, but misery for others\u2014no matter how well-traveled or experienced they are.\n\nPlan the trip that makes sense for you, not that matches the idealized cliche of what a solo adventure looks like. And if you\u2019re not sure what makes sense for you yet: baby steps",

Overestimating the cost of travel seems especially prevalent amongst older folks who are used to that paradigm or people who are just too inexperienced to know there are options, so it comes up a lot. But I always invite people to join me and I'm delighted for those who have the means to make the trip comfortable in the way that they want it to be.\n\nWhen I was backpacking through Central America, a friend joined me for a week and probably spent my whole trip's cost on it. His flight was more than 6x the price of mine because he was uncomfortable arriving late at night. He took short domestic flights instead of buses like me, ate out nearly every meal, and upgraded to a private room. I couldn't have afforded all that, but I'm also perfectly happy with the cheap options and stoked that they give me the freedom to go places. He was easily able to afford his version of the trip and I'm stoked he was able to do it in a way that was comfortable for him. We had a blast together, which was awesome! He still raves about his week in Central America.",

I met an Australian while I was in Europe a few months back and he mentioned he did the whole, multi-year, backpack around the world thing. He loved meeting new people, seeing incredible places, and visiting countries he\u2019d never dream of visiting. However, looking back on it, he realized he had no roots, lacked deep connections with friends, and missed out on family events. Too much traveling can definitely be bad for you and rob you of those connections that ground you and bring stability in your life IMO.",

I can\u2019t stand the over romanticizing that I will/should be meeting new people and making new friends\u2026part of the reason I love solo travel is I like being alone with own thoughts and sitting at a cafe in peace people watching and soaking in the feel of a culture and vibe of a place or exploring a city and new places without needing to socialize or have new friends\u2026yes occasionally if it happens organically but it is not this requirement or what makes the trip at all! Plus half the time everyone is just doing the light small talk to socialize that I find exhausting and I don\u2019t care enough. I always see \u201cmaking new friends/meeting new people\u201d on all those lists of perks of solo travel articles and I just roll my eyes as it feels like it misses the point of solo travel. Don\u2019t get me wrong there have been random fun wine fueled dinners when I got seated at a communal table and clicked with a well traveled cool couple across from me or with a cool group I got linked with on a guided tour but they were just added one off perks that were fun diversions not why I am solo traveling or looking for when I do travel",

He was having some relationship problems, and he told his fiancee it would be good to clear his mind.\n\nThe second he got back, she asked him \"Did you figure everything out!?\". I just found that almost comical that people expect the answer of all of life's mysteries to definitively solved in a week by being in another place.",

I have not and will not stay in a hostel, not even mildly interested in that.\n\nMy travel is also generally pretty targeted and purpose driven, ie: I'm traveling to this place to photograph these specific species of birds or I'm going to this place to spend the whole week diving these reefs.  If I meet people and make a few friends while doing that?  That's fine, but it's just 'extra frosting' at most.

I\u2019m not from Europe, the US or Australia so to me at least, most of the people I meet in hostels are still very different from me which keeps it interesting. \n\nIt\u2019s also nice when you meet someone in a hostel from a country you\u2019ve never been, and you can learn about it, and maybe as a result have a place to stay if you ever decide to visit. I\u2019ve taken a few people up on that offer (and will be taking someone I met in a hostel last year up on his offer this summer!) and it\u2019s been good times all around!",

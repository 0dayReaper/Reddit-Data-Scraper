Wondering if I'll have a better solo travel experience if I disconnect (maybe even deactivate accounts).\n\nI guess the main downside might be perception. Friends know I'm going on this trip and said that they were excited to see pictures / follow along. It might be abrupt to suddenly lose touch. Same with parents, though I can use WhatsApp.",

But I don\u2019t usually browse when traveling, solo or not.\n\nOther than that, you can post pics after your trip.  If you are posting for your friends, and to engage as they follow along, I can see how that can take away from being present on your \u201csolo\u201d trip.  \n\nI traveled with someone who\u2019s like that.

    "postText": "Since lockdown. I've always experienced social anxiety but a sense of normalcy always kept it in check. When covid lockdowns took over everyones life I felt okay going through things on my own. But I didn't realize how much it hurt in the long run being separated from that normalcy for so long. I barely noticed when everyone else got back to the everyday, I kept going in comfortable isolation. But I realized any time I wanted to go out to restaurants or social/busy spaces I couldn't shake that anxiety that became so overwhelming it pushed me to stay in longer and longer.\nIt's now my first solo trip abroad since then, and my first trip to Europe. Throwing myself into the deep end so to speak, though maybe not as deep as some of you. But wow.. after struggling a bit finding places to eat and visit I'm currently sitting in a local diner where no one speaks English and the local soccer/football team just won some sort of championship and it is going off the rails in this place. Feels good to be back outside my comfort zone.\nJust posting in case anyone else might be feeling the same and hesitant to immerse themselves. You don't need to go to the ends of the Earth to push yourself. I'm only in Lisbon, after a few days in Porto and Sao Miguel. Do what works for you, try something new and see how it goes!!",

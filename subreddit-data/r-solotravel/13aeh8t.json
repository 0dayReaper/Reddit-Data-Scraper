    "postText": "Hello, solo travelers!\n\nI am incredibly excited to embark on my third solo trip - to South Korea!\nI will be in Korea from September 1st to October 13th.\n\nI've crafted an extremely thourough itinerary, and I would be thrilled if any of you who\u2019ve traveled in South Korea share your advice and experience, so I can improve it :)\n\nHere are the regions I plan to visit, as well as the principal places I'll stay in (random order):\n\n- Seoul. Day trips to DMZ, Suwon - ~1 week to 10 days - probably in two stops\n- Gangwon-do - principally for Seoraksan, via - Gangneung (might visit Chuncheon, Sokcho) - ~3-5 days\n- Gyeonsangbuk-do (Gyeongju, Daegu) - ~4-6 days\n-Busan (with Jinju and Jirisan National Park) - ~1 week - 9 days\n- Jeollanam-do (Gwangju, Suncheon, Mokpo?) - ~5 days\n- Jeollabuk-do (Jeonju) - ~3-5 days\n- Jeju-do (Jeju-si, perhaps Sogwipo) - ~5-7 days\nI've figured out some sort of route to all these places:\n\nSeoul -&gt; Daegu -&gt; Busan (+Gyeongju) -&gt; Jeju (via flight, return) -&gt; Jinju (+ Jirisan) -&gt; Suncheon -&gt; Mokpo (?) -&gt; Gwangju -&gt; Jeonju -&gt; Seoul -&gt; Gangneung (+Sokcho, Seoraksan)\n\nWhich I can also flip:\n\nSeoul -&gt; Jeonju -&gt; Gwangju -&gt; Mokpo -&gt; Jeju (via ferry, one way) -&gt; Suncheon (return to Yeosu from Jeju) -&gt; Jinju (+Jirisan) -&gt; Busan (+Gyeongju) -&gt; Daegu -&gt; Seoul -&gt; Gangneung (+Sokcho, Seoraksan)\n\nI could also postpone Seoul and head off directly to Jeonju, Daegu, or Gangneung.\n\nThese routes stick to rail as much as possible, and use intercity buses only as links where they're faster.\n\nI also have some general questions:\n\n- I\u2019ve come to understand September is significantly less crowded than October - and so that it would be wiser to prioritise busier places (Seoul, Busan, Jeju, Seoraksan) in September. Have any of you travelled in these months? What was your experience like?\n\n- I\u2019ve read about the temple stays program. Have any of you tried it? What was it like?\nIs it worthwhile taking the ferry to Jeju-do instead of flying? Though less convenient, it fits into my route nicely, and I hate airports with a passion :)\n\n- Have any of you used the intercity buses while in Korea? How hectic are they? The routes look great on paper, but I\u2019d love to hear what it\u2019s like on the ground.\n\n- I\u2019ve noticed a lot of smaller national and provincial parks (Odaesan, Taebaek\u2026). Seeing as I\u2019m visiting the most well known parks in the country, are these worthwhile stops as well?\n\nAbout me:\nI'm 25 years old, from Israel. I've a fair bit of solo travel experience under my belt from my two previous journeys - The first to New Zealand (3 months), Australia (1 month) and Japan (10 days) just before COVID, and the second, last summer, to Italy ([Sicily](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/va73v2/trip_report_2_weeks_in_sicily/) and the [mainland](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/w3gbn4/trip_report_1_month_of_italian_highlights/) - 6 weeks) and [France](https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/x1i67p/trip_report_6_weeks_in_france/) (6 weeks).\n\nMy principal goal in this trip, just like the previous ones, is to immerse myself in the places and cultures I'm visiting. I'm a very slow traveller, and I'm much more concerned with experiencing the 'vibe' of each place I visit than seeing all the tourist attractions.\n\nI strongly prefer public transportation, but am willing to rent a car if absolutely necessary.\n\nI've started learning Korean about three weeks ago, and I'm hoping I can hold a basic conversation in Korean by the time I make it to Seoul. I've learned Hangeul and read it OK.\nI love hiking (though day hikes and overnighters are enough to satisfy me), history, art, food (everything goes!), photography and philosophy [I'm currenty doing my undergrad philosophy, so :) ].\n\nI've estimated the cost of this trip between 4,900,000 - 7,650,000 KRW, but I can comfortably spend as much as 9,100,000 KRW if necessary. This leaves me with a daily budget of 75,000-135,000 KRW.\n\nThat\u2019s all I can tell you about me and my plan. I know this is a lot\u2026 but any and all advice, comments and criticisms would be greatly appreciated!\n\nAnd of course, I\u2019ll be sure to post the full trip report here!\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Skip Suncheon there's nothing there (trust me I lived there lol), take a day trip to see the National Park and that's about it. Go to Yeosu instead, it's a lovely beach/port town with great seafood. Mokpo (Purple island is amazing) is nice but getting around to the interesting places is a bit of a headache. A car might be neccessary. \n\nDaegu also has pretty much nothing to see, take a day or two and move on. Plus its hotter than hell there, hottest place I've been in Korea.\n\nIntercity buses are easy, affordable and convenient, pretty much available every 1hr or 2hr even in the smaller cities and you can buy tickets online or on the day at the kiosk. Just pitch up and show your ticket and bobs your uncle.\n\nSeoul and Busan are busy year round, they really aren't that big in the sense that everyone goes to the same handful of popular areas so it's pretty much always busy. September is nice since its around the end of summer so it won't feel like the pit of hell everyday.",

Haven't heard about Purple Island either - I'll look it up!\n\nI'm not sure which national park you're referring to (I recall Jirisan is relatively close - and it's on my itinerary) - I'd be thrilled if you could clarify that for me :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for your help!",

    "postText": "Looking for opinions if anyone is willing to offer them!\n\nI (35m, USA) am taking off 6/29-7/9 and trying to decide between going to Paris+Greece or Paris+Denmark (Copenhagen)+Sweden. Cost isn't a huge issue as I don't often get opportunities to travel. I'm also open to alternative suggestions from where to go after Paris besides UK / Brussels / Italy / Spain / Portugal / Germany. My intention would be to leave Paris early 7/3 Monday AM for the next place. \n\n**Paris+Greece Pros**\n\n* Love history esp. French + Greek history, art, walking tours\n* Love french and greek food\n* Potential for a day or two at the beach\n* Multiple options for Greek islands to visit after Athens\n\n**Paris+Greece Cons**\n\n* High season for Greece, worried Athens+Santorini will be overrun with tourists\n* 3.5 hour flight\n* Greece will be hot\n* Greek ferries apparently unreliable, necessitating flexibility in schedule  \n\n\n**Paris+Denmark+Sweden Pros**\n\n* More countries! \n* Scandinavia is 2nd only behind Vietnam on my 'must visit' list. \n* Great weather in Denmark / Sweden\n* Copenhagen food scene\n\n**Paris+Denmark+Sweden Cons**\n\n* Not really a true 'Scandinavia' trip just a quick visit, maybe better to save for proper visit later\n* Less marquee attractions\n* Would need to fly / overnight train b/t Copenhagen and Stockholm\n* Swedish food apparently underwhelming\n* Seemingly less opportunities to experience nature, would be mostly urban  \n\n\nThat's all I can think of. I don't have many people IRL to discuss my plans with so any input is greatly appreciated! Thank you",

            "comment": "\u2018More countries\u2019 comes with its drawbacks - you never get time to actually experience a place if all you do is spend 2-3 days - you\u2019ll only end up visiting tourist traps and finding the places underwhelming. I\u2019ve done that myself early on and now just prefer experiencing a single country instead of trying to run all over Europe.\n\nMy advice would be to just do Paris and another part of France - the Haute Alps if you like the outdoors, C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur if you like the coast, Loire if you like chateaus, and Bordeaux if you want some wine. Paris done over 4-5 days will give you plenty of time to take in history (even Greek history, the museums have a lot to appreciate).",

I do not expect it to be a relaxing time. I have experience with this sort of trip, multiple Europe stops within 9 days, and it\u2019s been fine. \n\nI appreciate the suggestions about France but at this time I\u2019m not interested in exploring the country. If anything I\u2019d rather fly out of Paris the same day I arrive if I had to. I\u2019m only flying in there because it was significantly cheaper than flying direct to almost anywhere I wanted to go.\n\nLet me know if you have any suggestions in light of that. Thanks.",

Its when the cruise groups descend on town when things get overrun. Unfortunately, you won't be able to avoid the peak season crowds in Santorini, but it really is one of those places that need to be seen to be believed. Mykonos has great beaches, and a still-strong party scene, if you're into that. Quieter Aegean islands like Patmos, Milos, Serifos/Sifnos are also lovely - similar landscape and look to that of Santorini/Mykonos, but far fewer crowds. On the Adriatic side, have a look at Kefalonia and Zakynthos - the landscape here is more lush than in the Aegean, and the culture is a little more Italian influenced as well.\n\nScandinavia: Copenhagen has a great food scene, and Noma is closing from 2024, so it's a worthwhile stop. Stockholm is a very pretty city as well, and the food scene isn't as dull as you'd think. However, the real highlight, IMO, is the Norwegian coastline - the fiords are spectacular. Trondheim and Geirangerfjord are relatively easily accessible, but outlying islands like Faroe and Svalbard feel like they're a different planet altogether. I'd push for Iceland too, but it's honestly a separate trip by itself.\n\nOther destinations to think of can be a string of cities through East Europe. It's relatively easy to train hop from Prague to Vienna to Budapest. \n\nAlternatively, a circuit through the Balkans is great too - Slovenia (Ljubljana / Lake Bled) - Croatia (Plitvice - Dubrovnik) - Bosnia (Mostar) - Montenegro (Kotor) is a beautiful stretch, but you may have to leave a place or two out to be able to fit within your timeline.",

The Arc De Triomphe Carrousel and the Neptune Fountain are completely encased under tenting. Some scaffolding  at the Eiffel as well. Further, The Paris Mayor has also mandated the night lights for the major attractions (including the Eiffel Tower) shut down at 11pm.  Many of the Fountains are not running either.  Of course, there are many, many other things to do and enjoy in Paris. First time visitors might consider delaying until 6 months post Olympics...",

(You're gonna buy food onboard for sure tho((prices still cheaper then in Oslo, expect 20 euros for a good  pizza Abit more for buffet) you leave from CPH at 4 o clock. The you get to Oslo at around 10 in the morning and then you have until about 4 or 5 to get back to the boat and then you're back in Copenhagen at 10 o clock the next day. Perfect little getaway and the morning and evening views when you sail through to Oslo fjord is beautiful... used to work on the boat a while back and i still miss those morning and afternoon on break orbefore work just sitting on the deck with a coffe and looking at the fjord pass by.

            "comment": "I would suggest doing one or the other rather than cramming in a lot of rushing around to tourist spots and never relaxing:\n\nA couple of days in Athens + a week at a quieter island is quite doable. One of your days in Athens could be a visit to the Acropolis and Agora and the other could be a bus tour or boat tour with historic sights.\n\nA number of islands have at least a few great beaches, and typically the heat there is mitigated by (A) rest &amp; relaxation, (B) swimming, and (C) a refreshing breeze off the Aegean.\n\nI don't recommend Santorini or Mikonos in high season. They're mobbed. Try Paros, Antiparos, Naxos, Andros, Serifos, Amorgos, Sikinos or others in the Cyclades, or Skopelos or Skiathos in the Sporades further north. If you're restless and still want to tour to many sites while having the island experience, try Rhodes or Crete.\n\nI suggest choosing one island and enjoying it more deeply, unless you want packing, unpacking, transferring to ports and accommodations, and sitting on various forms of transportation to form the bulk of your experience. If you do love the *travel* part of travel, consider booking a cabin on your ferries while island-hopping, or joining an island-hopping cruise.\n\nRealize that the better part of a day will be taken up flying to and from your cities *as well as* ferrying to and from your islands.\n\nParis by itself is also a magnificent trip. Paris offers more than enough to enjoy for nine days. You could spend three weeks there and not complete all the major sights, not to mention eating and reading at caf\u00e9s, picnicking in gardens, having dinner along the Seine in a b\u00e2teau-mouche, taking in opera, dance, theater, having a spa day, etc.\n\nThere is indeed Greek history to be seen in Paris museums, but truly the Louvre is a hellish experience I wouldn't wish on anyone. Be ready for a pilgrimage through lineups, sweltering heat, leg pain, and churning crowds (many of whom seem to be there more for the selfies than the art itself). Don't think you'll just 'nip in' to see the Mona Lisa. Hard skip.\n\nScandinavia is 'must visit' for you, but you'll want to spend more time there and really see a lot of places that aren't so close together, right?",

I didn't love the party scene or the super strong and constant winds.\n\nI really loved Greece, we went to a ton of archeological sites and saw so many of the main sites. Everything we ate was amazing, I dont remember a single bad meal. Greece was HOT, 40C on the mainland most days we were there. I dont have an issue with that, but my husband struggled some days.\n\n  \n**Scandinavia** \\- I was in Copenhagen, Oslo, Bodo, Trondheim, and Stockholm. The food I had everywhere was good. Stockholm was the least exciting but still fine. \n\nI really enjoyed just wandering around Copenhagen, everything was pretty even though it was quite chilly when I was there.  I took an 8 hour train to Oslo.\n\nEverywhere in Norway was incredible. Bodo is slightly south of the artic circle and about an hour flight from Oslo. It was stunning. then we did a 9hour gorgeous train to Levanger and stayed with some friends before going to Tronheim for a day. We flew one hour back to Oslo. I would happily go back to Norway. \n\nI only had 36hours in Stockholm and spent most of it in Old Town, which was pretty and neat but definitely tourist trappy, which was fine for the day. I stumbled into the changing of the guard at the palace by accident and went into the cutest little shop with woolen mitts and socks.",

I also don't feel the need to force myself to see/do everything.  If I'd rather spend two hours at a caf\u00e9 people watching than forcing myself to tour a palace, that's ok and I shouldn't feel guilty about it.\n\n\n",

I just started walking and kept going down streets that looked interesting and felt like a direction I hadn't been in yet.  I'd occasionally stop at a shop or a bench with a nice view and just watch the city exist.  It was such a peaceful experience.  Then when I was tired, I just pulled up google maps to navigate back to my AirBnB.\n\nAll my friends were like \"What?!  You didn't go do X, Y, and Z?!!\"",

YHA hostels, at least the ones I've stayed in, are never party hostels. In fact, you'll often find families staying in private rooms. You'll also see more older people.\n\n\n\nI avoid hostels that advertise themselves as \"party\" hostels.  I read reviews and look for hostels that are described as more \"relaxed.\"\n\n\n\nEdit: it's funny because the first time I was in Prague I stayed in a 4-star hotel and now I stayed in a hostel.

I wasn't bothered much by the fact that they were there. I was a bit wary when they talked to me alone inside the shared rooms, but I relaxed more and more throughout the conversations as they opened up about their lives and travels.\n\nIf you look your age, you should be fine, e.g. I wouldn't think that OP is a creep. If you look a bit older, or backpack later in life, it might be a bit harder to be included in conversations and outings. I think the key here is to just be yourself, be open, and share stories without trying to \"fit in\" with the younger folks as much as just get along with them. And if you're super nervous about seeming creepy, you can try a private room in a hostel.",

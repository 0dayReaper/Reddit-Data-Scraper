I was thinking about going to Peru later this year and since I'm from the Northeast USA it's almost a whole day to get there. It would be so nice to have someone who knows out flight stops, can wait for layovers with me, can help me find a place to exchange money, etc.! I guess my best option is just bringing a friend so we can experience it all for the first time together, I have no idea. It's my first flight that long so I feel like it's going to be half the trip for me.",

Posting this question, while it seems very over the top, may just be a way to get their anxiety out, and to hear realistic answers from more experienced travelers. \n\nI\u2019ve been traveling for over 2 decades and I still get nervous - the difference is that I face my nerves and persevere. Now, if the OP has crippling anxiety, I would suggest not to do such a trip by themselves. If that\u2019s not the case and it\u2019s just normal anxiety (meaning that you wouldn\u2019t be risking your health) I suggest just doing their research and taking the leap, although a shorter trip or a closer location may be a better choice until the OP feels more confident. \n\nI also suggest getting trip insurance.\n\nMany escorted tours will meet you at the airport of your arrival destination. To expect an escorted tour yo meet you at your departing location however is definitely not something I have ever heard (aside from China or Japan tours). What you can do is contact a tour company and inquire if you can be put in contact with other travelers leaving from your area.",

The company I used to travel to Peru had a person accompany the group for the entire trip starting from the airport from Montreal where we all met to fly to Lima. Their job was to make sure that our trip was comfortable and enjoyable. We then met our national guide in Lima.\n\nLook up local travel agencies that offer group tours. You're more likely to find tours with someone who meets you at the airport you're leaving from \n\nFor the people who have been less than nice about your question: I've traveled quite a bit on my own before doing group tours and I can definitely figure stuff out by myself. But I've found that the group format does make it more relaxing because someone else is there to deal with the logistics and smooth out any ruffles.\n\nI had my preconceived notions about the group tour experience but I found that it can be enjoyable if you pick a company that caters to the kind of traveling you like. I still do travel on my own but I do find value in getting on a tour for more logistically complicated trips.",

Its usually larger in size through (like 30-40 bus full of tourists) and the tour guide helps with logistics, ensures itinerary is followed, and acts as a translator.

A group of us young ones wanted to do Tibet, and decided to buy a package thing from Nepal for a private tour for the 7 of us, local guides in Tibet. The travel company owner decided to act as tour guide and joined our tour \"free of charge\", we later found out he's just jumping on the trip because he wanted to go but didnt want to go alone.\n\nHe acted as tour guide so he collected all our passports and documents from our hotel in Nepal. Then he managed to lose our visa paperwork somewhere at Kathmandu airport, and only realized once we have arrived in freakin Tibet with no paperwork. All seven of us are avid travellers and had previously insisted on carrying our own docs when he insisted saying its his job as tour guide.\n\nThankfully we managed to escape immigration holding cells by having our Tibetan guides guarantee our return if the visa paperwork do not arrive in the next flight from Kathmandu. By sheer luck someone had found them and reported them to the airline who who agreed to send it on next flight in.",

Since most tours have people from all over the world in them, it's not really feasible to have someone accompany people. \n\nIf you're worried about connections and layovers, most airports have pretty good websites. I've definitely checked to see how far away gates are or even if there will be a restaurant/ coffee shop open while I'm there. I've definitely checked even when it's not somewhere new that I'm nervous about, I just like to get an idea where I'm going beforehand. \n\nFor money exchange, I've been to Peru a few times and I got some of their currency from home to tide me over the first few days and then just used an ATM once I was there. My card has good rates/ low fees for international transactions so it works for me.\n\nYou can also check online, there are lots of travel blogs/ websites about pretty much any place you want to go. I usually read a few to make sure the info is consistent but you can get a lot of info from there too.",

You book a whole package with the tour guide, and they will arrange everything including hotel, transportation, things to do, etc. Might cost more than usual, but in countries where language is a struggle, its worth it since you are with someone who knows what they are doing. \n\nI'm assuming since this is very common in Bahrain, this has to be a thing in America as well",

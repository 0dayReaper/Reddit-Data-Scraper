    "postText": "I\u2019m nearing the end of my second week in Peru and just finished the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu \ud83c\udf89 Unfortunately I had an incredibly difficult time on the trail despite being acclimated and a somewhat experienced hiker in high altitudes, and I discovered last night that this was most likely due to an incredibly painful ovarian cyst. I\u2019ve never had one before and am shocked at how weak I feel. I was supposed to hike to Rainbow Mountain tomorrow and leave Peru Saturday, but I\u2019m heavily considering cutting that hike and going home tomorrow night. I really hate to do this because I have been looking forward to this hike for months and I\u2019ve loved my time in Peru, but I\u2019m worried that doing the hike may put my health at risk and that at this point I may not even be physically capable of finishing. Any words of encouragement/things to make me feel better about such a disappointing end to an incredible trip would be very appreciated, thanks &lt;3\n\nETA: Thank you so much everyone for sharing your experiences and thoughts, it really helped my mindset today! I appreciate this community so much &lt;3",

Realistically you wouldn\u2019t enjoy the hike, so effectively it\u2019s a choice between resting and having a miserable time (not having an amazing experience).\n\nI ended up with concussion after being hit by a bike in Brazil. Hospital, stitches. I rested for several weeks and was later able to continue. \n\nIt is very disappointing but you have plenty more adventures ahead.",

The trip was supposed to be about 8 hours of hiking but I just didn't feel fit enough\n\nAfter the trip I kept waiting for the people I met to text me with updates and I only got them late in the evening: the trip was a lot more difficult than expected and they took more than 12 hours (instead of the expected 8). They had bad weather and the path was very slippery, to the point where not everyone even went to the top, They even split the bigger group into 2 groups because some people got a taxi for the last part because they were too tired. If I had joined them, I'd probably have slowed them down a lot and more important - I would have totally tired myself out even if I was able to finish. But worst case scenario I would have brought myself and the others in danger. Instead, I had a slower day and took care of myself.\n\nIt sucked to have missed the experience, but the mountains aren't going anywhere and if you're not fit, you're not fit. Especially when you're travelling, it's important to take care of yourself!",

That trip ended 3 days early because international borders were closing due to covid.  When I look back on it now it doesn't bother me at all that I lost those 3 days.\n\nSecond,  a general rule I follow while hiking / trekking -- if I sustain a painful injury or condition on trail and I'm still mobile, I cut the hike short and exit because that condition increases the risk that I'll need assistance getting off trail later. Knowing when to end a hike or not go at all because you don't feel like all of the conditions are right is a critical skill that all hikers need to have. And sounds like you've got that skill...  You can maybe return to Peru in the future!",

When I walked the Jersey leg of the Channel Island Way walk in the UK I was around ten miles from completing it when my feet felt like they were on fire. Part of the hike is five mile beach and my feet had been rubbed sore because of sand. I returned to the campsite I was staying on and almost soaked my feet in antiseptic cream. A few days later,and my feet very well padded in boots that had been scrubbed clean on the inside, I walked those last miles and completed the Channel Island Way. I felt a profound sense of loss on the journey home,and sat at the back of the ferry for the three+ hours just looking at the ships wake and reliving the journey. The Channel Island Way and the walk  along the coast path of the five main islands. It's not particularly long, around 120 miles at most,but  I am so glad I stopped and saved my feet rather than keep on going and being in pain. A few days rest really made my memories so much better.

            "comment": "Congratulations on completing the Inca Trail! I\u2019ll offer an opinion/insight into how cutting a trip short because of health can be okay. I\u2019d been traveling since January and really wanted to do the Inca Trail since Ive been wanting to visit Machu Picchu for literally 20+ years. I wasn\u2019t sure if it would be possible with some of the protests and political upheaval a few months ago and THEN I got really bad food poisoning in Colombia (10 days including a hospital trip for IV fluids and 9 days of a 103 fever). In combination with that, I had been having a much harder time coping with some existing mental health conditions and realized I needed to get back stateside sooner than expected. It sucked to come to the conclusion that my health (mental and physical) was too bad to do the Inca Trail this spring. So when I realized my original vision for the trip probably wasn\u2019t gonna happen, I reframed the trip as a scouting mission to Peru: making a list of all the places I want to go and things I want to do when I come back. And I just couldn\u2019t leave without seeing Machu Picchu, so I decided to compromise and did an all-inclusive door-to-door tour with Inca Rail that was surprisingly fun (I usually prefer to do things on my own or hire guides independently). While I was bummed to not be able to visit like I initially dreamed, it was still an incredible experience and I loved every minute. Sometimes external, uncontrollable shit interferes with our original travel plans\u2014going solo gives you the freedom and flexibility to pivot when the inevitable happens. Back home now and it was the right choice.",

If it is just the hike part you are worried about Palcoyo is an easier alternative. If you just need to go home though, no worries, I think you\u2019ve already seen the best of peru!",

It totally kicked my butt. My mom is usually bursting with endless energy but was throwing up from the altitude / climb throughout the day, even though that was the end of our 2 week trip, and she did great in Machu Picchu. No problems at all. And while Rainbow Mountain was nice, Machu Picchu / Inca Trail is so much more beautiful (to me anyway). So for sure I'd say just go back another time and take care of yourself.

I started the trip with my mum and sister and then was going to go off on my own to Poland, Czechia, and Hungary. \n\nHowever, the day after I arrived in Europe was the day of the terrorist bombings in London, close enough for us to hear one of the explosions from our accommodation. \n\nWe were never actually in any danger, but at the time we didn\u2019t know that. We didn\u2019t know if there would be more coordinated attacks around the corner. 39 people were murdered within a 5 minute walk from where I was. It was the most bizarre and surreal day. \n\nWe left London the next day as per our schedule, but further into the trip, with my sense of security totally destroyed, I decided to go home early. I just didn\u2019t think visiting Auschwitz and other war/Holocaust sites would be good for my mental health after our London experience. \n\nI\u2019m so glad I did. It took me a while to feel secure again and I don\u2019t think I would have dealt well with being on my own. Three years later, I went back to Europe and I visited all the places I had been planning to visit in 2005. \n\nI was crushed at changing my plans but in hindsight it was the right thing to do in my best interest.",

It took me six hours and some of it involved climbing chest high rocks and crawling, but I can honestly say I did it. There are two routes and because I am curious I did the difficult one. The alternative was an easy hike through the fields adjacent to the cliff. I like to think you would have been curious too. See you on the path one day.",

Luckily for us as tourists, there is no interest in involving us in any sort of unrest, and at most it would cause inconvenience and/or delays over any sort of danger.

Beyond that point, it starts to defeat its own purpose. Go home or do whatever you think is the best for your health now. And in my experience, it could probably be even better not to complete your bucket list for Peru all at once, so you will have a reason to come back and discover more than you planned!",

All medical advice I\u2019ve received from the clinic at Machu Picchu and my obgyn at home thus far has been to take pain meds and rest. Are you familiar with ovarian cysts? You are the only person in this thread who has said I should go despite my current state hahaha",

Rainbow Mountain isn't for the faint of heart (even only the 400m to get to the top from the parking lot is daunting - and I'm an experienced hiker as well!). Definitely come back one day to do that hike. It's absolutely incredible, but like most things you'll want to experience it when you're feeling 100% to really appreciate it :)",

I walked part of the Welsh Gower Peninsula but after a few days of continuous rain I decided to stop and complete it another time. Walking through horizontal rain isn't much fun. Happily I got home, dried out and in a few days went to the Channel Islands in the UK and the weather was glorious. Sometimes we just have to stop and go to plan B.",

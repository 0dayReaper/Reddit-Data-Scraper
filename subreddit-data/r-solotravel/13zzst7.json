    "postText": "Hi All! In May of 2020 I had my dream Europe trip planned and of course due to unfortunate pandemic related reasons had to cancel. I'm in the process of planning and saving for a redemtion trip in Summer of 2024 (planning a May start). I was wondering if the itinerary below is doable or if it would kill me? \n\nCity/Days: \nPorto\t3 days --&gt; Lisbon\t2 days --&gt; Seville \t3 days --&gt;Fes \t3 days --&gt; Chefchaouen \t2 days --&gt; Tangier\t1 day --&gt; Barcelona 3 days --&gt; Marcielle 1 day --&gt; Nice\t1 day --&gt; Florence\t2 days --&gt; Rome\t 2 days --&gt; Athens \t2 days --&gt; Paros 5 days --&gt; Santorini\t2 days --&gt; Istanbul\t1 day --&gt; Cappadocia\t2 days --&gt; Istanbul\t2 days --&gt; Budapest\t2 days --&gt; Dubrovnik\t2  days --&gt; Split\t2 days --&gt; Ljubujana\t1 day --&gt; Prague \t3 days --&gt; Krakow\t5 days --&gt; Warsaw\t5 days --&gt; Szczecin\t7 days --&gt; Berlin 3 days --&gt; Stolckhome\t3 days --&gt; Osolo \t3  days --&gt; Iceland \t12 days --&gt; Amsterdam \t3 days --&gt; Paris\t 2 days\n\nBased on prices seen on Rome to Rio and HostelWorld, I've budgeted the following: \nStays: 3540 \nFood: 4084 (budgeting for grocery shopping)\nTravel Between Cities: 2630\nApprox Trip Sum: 10254\nCost per Day: 119.25",

Are you also including how much transiting you're doing? a lot of these are far distances that will eat a lot of time.\n\nImo not doable, budget wise, and the planning is too much travel, with skimping in some cities (rome, paris, lisbon)\n\nalso that formatting is rough",

The budget isnt undoable, but concessions would need to be made, likely being food or activities\n\nActivities would include going inside palaces, museums, etc\n\nFor formatting, you can break it up by countries like, or just have more line breaks\n\nPortugal (5 days total)\n\n3 days porto\n\n2 days lisbon",

What does that look like? \n\nBudget time to get in from the airport to your area (if things are on time), check into their lodging, and then check out/back to the airport at the end. How will they get around the area to the can\u2019t-miss places, restaurants, sights? What do they even want to see in your area? How long does it take to get from one thing to another? How expensive is the transportation- cheaper transit is often slower transit. What does getting to a grocery store and having time to prepare food look like, if that is how you are budgeting money? Is three days enough, or are they going to miss out on a ton considering days 1 and 3 include travel to/from? \n\nYou\u2019re going to have to figure out all of the above for places you\u2019ve never been before where you also don\u2019t speak the language- for every place on this list, whether you plan it in detail ahead of time or just wing it. Thinking through the details will give you a better time/money expectation.",

            "comment": "I agree with the other sentiments about tempo. I recently got back from a 24 day trip where I didn\u2019t spend more than 2 nights in any place and I took a couple overnight trains. I was completely exhausted by week 2. You\u2019re not sleeping well because it\u2019s hostels, you can\u2019t sleep well on an overnight train, not to mention the stress that comes with trying to squeeze in everything you want to do in basically one day in a new city, nearly every day. \n\nOne lesson that stood out to me from this trip (aside from sleep being very important to enjoying your time\u2026) is that when travelling, things WILL go wrong. I had 4 flight delays, 1 flight cancellation, 3 total missed flight connections, 3 cancelled trains, 2 delayed and rerouted trains, missed reservations and appointments. You\u2019re going to spend a lot more time and energy in transit than you might anticipate. \n\nI see that later on in your trip you want to spend longer amounts of time in certain cities (I only spent 36 hours in Krakow and I so wish I stayed longer!), I think I\u2019d suggest doing more of your trip like this, 3-7 days in a place so you get a better sense of what\u2019s what, AND you have time to do regular person things like sleep in, do laundry, or have a lazy TV watching day now n then without feeling guilty. I think it could be fun to do a week or two of travelling with a faster tempo some time in the middle to still hit most of the places you wanted to go, but to be completely honest, I would never travel again like I just did \u2014 FAR too stressful and exhausting.",

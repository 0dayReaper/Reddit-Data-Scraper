Next week we'll be back to weekly destination discussions.",

Highly recommend bringing a Kindle or similar \"reader,\" makes it easy to read books without needing to fill backpack space with them. \n\nRather than money belts, when feasible, I like using this small, discreet pouch you can hang around your neck and wear under a jacket, as long as you're visiting somewhere cold. Slightly easier to access if needed, but still very out of sight and reach of potential pickpockets.",

            "comment": "Sharing my perspective as a petite woman with a short torso. My pack is a Gregory Jade 38 in a women's XS, which has a capacity of 36 litres. It fits in most airline carry-on dimensions and can easily carry everything I need for just about any length trip. I recently spent a month in Southeast Asia with just this pack.\n\nI know a lot of people love the Osprey Farpoint/Fairview (actually, my husband has one). But I personally find it so uncomfortable to carry a pack that's made for a much longer torso, and I always recommend going to get properly fitted in person. This is especially true if you have narrow shoulders or a short torso.\n\nFor a daybag, I like a cross-body purse (mine is the Timbuk2 Jessie). I prefer cross-body since it's easier to hold while walking for longer periods of time, and offers a bit more security than a regular purse. In it, I carry my stuff for the day: Glasses/sunglasses case (I wear prescription so I always am carrying whichever pair isn't on my nose), phone, wallet, water, map or mini notebook, camera, etc. I generally only carry as much cash as I need for the day and leave the rest, with my backup cards and passport, safely locked away in a hotel locker or under my clothes in my money belt. Obviously nothing is foolproof, but for most situations, this is pretty decent in terms of safety. \n\nOh, and I also have a collapsible daypack (mine is an Eddie Bauer) that folds down tiny. I often pack it inside my main pack and use it if I need a bigger bag than the purse for the day, e.g. for hiking. I find I rarely use it, to be honest, since most of what I need for an average day can fit in my purse.",

            "comment": "Don't rush choosing a backpack. This is going to be a constant companion on your trip, so it should be a reliable partner. \n\nGive yourself time to inspect each bag, try it on, try it on filled with stuff (pillows are a quick item to fill up a bag) and practice walking around with it. Practice lifting it up, like to put in an overhead bin on a plane or train.\n\nBack when I was doing my first big trip, I visited like 4-5 different outdoor hiking stores and looked at a bunch of bags before finding one. It was annoying and time-consuming, but totally worth it. The winning backpack served me well for about 10 years.\n\nWhen you get a bag, take some time to adjust all the straps to fit your body. Again, it's worth it to find that right fit for yourself. I was dumb and put up with some unnecessary discomfort for too long before fixing it. Then I wanted to kick myself for not fixing it sooner.\n\nOn the flip side, don't fall for fancy marketing. I once bought a backpack with a slick website, but the bag wasn't the right one for my needs. I don't blame the bag, it delivered on its claims. But it was just too small for me.\n\nGoing on a tangent, don't let people make you feel guilty about how much or how little you like to pack. If you've done a couple trips and know what things you actually use, stick to your guns.\n\nThat being said, my favorite backpack I've ever used was a Kelty Redwing 50 Reserve. Unfortunately, it looks like it's been discontinued. If I had to get a new backpack, I'd look for another Kelty backpack with 50-liter capacity. \n\nMy other favorite is a Made By Design backpack from Target. Like a backpack/suitcase hybrid. Good for shorter overnight and weekend trips. Unfortunately, also discontinued. On the bright side, the \"45L Travel Backpack - Open Story\" on the Target website looks almost identical to the backpack I have. Guess they just rebranded that backpack?\n\nI prefer backpacks with a clamshell design, that almost open up all the way like a briefcase. So much easier than top-loading backpacks where you have to reach in from the top. I have bad luck and whatever thing I suddenly need is usually at the bottom of the bag, lol. \n\nHope this helps.",

I wouldn't say I was obsessed with gear, but I used a Kelty Redwing 50L with a smaller backpack/fanny pack that I loved and would pack to the brim for a few trips. Some places I went (Mongolia and Siberia in winter) needed more gear than others, but in not-so-severe places, I would think \"I've got all this space, I'll fill it up!\" and would end up with a heavy bag and stuff I would rarely/not use.\n\nI just went on a cycling trip with a friend through Japan where anything I packed would be extra weight. I really cut down and we were surprised with how we could go for weeks with only just enough clothes and other equipment that all fits into a carry-on-sized bike bag.",

I haven't found any faults in it yet. I also have its 60l bigger brother but in fact haven't had the need to use it just yet.\n\nFor securing it, you can put small padlocks on its zippers, but I also like to use a PacSafe cable lock, I think it's called WrapSafe, to secure it in place when lockers aren't available.\n\nFor daily use or day trips I have a lightweight backpack that's basically made of the same material as umbrellas. It packs super small when not in use, you barely notice it's there.",

            "comment": "For my first big trip, I went with a Farpoint 55L. In the big 40L pack I had all my clothes and toiletries and stuff, then in the 15L pack, I had my camera and laptop and some other things I wanted quick access to. \n\nWhat I found from day one was that carrying a 55L backpack around everywhere was super uncomfortable and awkward. You lose balance, it hurts, you get sweaty, and anywhere with a crowd sucks as you bash into people at every turn. Carrying just the 40L pack on your back and then the 15L pack on your front was a little better, but you looked dumb and it was still really awkward.\n\nI ended up just carrying the 15L pack on my back and then carrying the 40L bag around as a duffel bag. Which was fine most of the time, although in some airports where you had to walk 10+ minutes to the gate, it was a pain.\n\nI've not used the Farpoint since, and instead just travel with a 40L carry-on suitcase and a 20L backpack. It's a lot more comfortable to get around with. The wheels are perfect in every airport/train station (which is 80% of the time when you're carrying your pack), and for the rest of the time, the wheels also work fine. Occasionally I'll carry the suitcase up some stairs or across really awkward streets but those instances aren't very common.\n\nI'm getting ready for my second long-term trip in a few months and want to switch out my suitcase for something more durable. Currently debating between the Osprey Farpoint Wheels 36 and the Daylite Carry on 40.\n\nBoth are sort of hybrids, which I like the sound of. The Daylite is a bit lighter and cheaper, and has more storage. It has attachable shoulder straps so you can use it as a backpack, but they're quite basic ones so wouldn't be ideal for long periods of use. The Farpoint has proper built-in shoulder straps like you'd find on a normal Osprey bag, but you sacrifice some weight and space for them.\n\nCurrently swaying more towards the Daylite as I can't imagine there will be many instances where I'd want to use the shoulder straps for more than 30 minutes or so. I've been to 9 countries across three continents so far and have never once wished I had a backpack instead of a suitcase. But maybe that time will come eventually.",

For some trips I also take a small shoulder bag to use at night - this is also handy for flights.\n\nI've had no trouble taking this suitcase all over the world on public transport: it's been through the Paris Metro and London Underground on several occasions, as well as the Tokyo Subway, Singapore and Hong Hong subway systems and lots more. The suitcase has also done fine with cobbled streets in Europe. \n\nWith the problems with luggage over the last year or so I've made a couple of international trips for work using two carry on sized bags (one checked, one carry on).

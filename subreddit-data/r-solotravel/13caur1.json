    "postText": "Hi ! I'm doing my first solo trip and I'm really excited/nervous and I would really appreciate tips/recommendations, especially for the second half of my trip. Does the island hopping in Croatia make sense? Do I need to book in advance ferry tickets? \n\nAlso, should I spend more/less time in some places?\n\nMy budget is 6000-7000$ (excluding flights). Here it is :\n\n21-30th June : Portugal (3 days Lison, 6 days Lagos)\n\n30-5th July : Barcelona\n\n5-16th July : Malta\n\n16-29th : Italy (with family, and I luckily will not have to spend money)\n\n29-3th August : Budapest\n\n3th August : Budapest to Zagreb\n\n4th August : Zagreb to Plitvice Lakes to Split\n\n5-9th August : Brac\n\n9-11th August : Hvar\n\n11th-15th : Korcula \n\n15-17th : Dubrovnik\n\n17th-22th : Montenegro\n\n22th-28th : Nice\n\nThank you!",

I just read about an island you can get to by ferry from Cannes and spend the day. There are underwater sculptures off the coast, a museum, restaurant, pine forest and beaches there. \n\nThe Rothschild mansion can be reached by bus. The multi level gardens are stunning and the tea room has the most gorgeous 3 sided views of the Mediterranean while you have ice cream or lunch. \n\n15 minutes on a city bus from Nice Port Lympia gets you to Villefrenche sur Mer with a long sweep of sandy beach and a great old town full of restaurants and cafes. \n\nAn hour on the train gets you to Ventimiglia, Italy for the day. I don\u2019t especially like Monaco, which is on the way, but Menton is a really beautiful French seaside town on that route with great waterside cafes that I would go to. If you take that route North by car, the views are gorgeous and you can see why the rich people live in Monaco. \n\nIn the other direction, a bus or a train heading South gets you to Antibes in an hour. More sandy beaches, old town with great shopping, restaurants. In Cap d\u2019Antbes there is a botanical garden and all around coastal natural beauty off the charts.\n\nNice itself has lots of great restaurants and bars. The beaches are stones, not sand though. Buy water shoes. \n\nCannes is further on from Antibes and meh in my opinion",

It\u2019ll be cheaper and will give you the option of discovering spots like Nimes and Carcassone en route. Malta is lovely but it\u2019s skippable in the broad scheme of things. I\u2019d use the saved time to do the Balkans more exhaustively - swing down to Montenegro via Slovenia (loveliest part of Europe IMO), the Croatian Coast, and Mostar. It\u2019s also worthwhile rationalising your time to try and see some of Andalusia while heading from the Algarve to Barcelona. Porto is a great stop to round off your time in Portugal as well!",

If not, please consider both - the Al Hambra and the Mezquita are the highlights of Spanish Moorish architecture. The cliffside town of Ronda is unique as well!\n\nWhat I liked most about Slovenia was how pretty, diverse, but undervisited it was - you'll find far fewer crowds here than at similar calibre attractions in more mainstream countries. It's almost like Europe in miniature, with the culture, architecture, and landscape having a mix of Balkan, Italian, and Austro-Hungarian. The capital, Ljubljana, is one of the prettiest cities around, as is the port town of Piran. The caving is excellent and unique - you won't find that in other European countries. But the crown jewel really is the stunning alpine scenery around Lake Bled and the Julian alps. Plus it's a compact and affordable (compared to western Europe), and very safe and progressive.",

There are busses that run to Lake Bled from the airport, and you can use that as a jump off point to go some other places. You\u2019ll need a car to really experience the Alps and that area though",

Personally I\u2019d suggest 3 nights, with the first day including the travel to get down there.\n\nYou could add another day in Lisbon, and two more in Porto. Or three in porto. Or whatever, maybe send those days to another city entirely.\n\nAlso way too much time in Malta. I just went there for i believe 4 nights and saw mostly everything I want to. If you\u2019re a slower paced traveler, which i guess you\u2019ll find out soon enough, then maybe 6 days would be a good amount. Regardless, you will probably get bored with 11 days there. It\u2019s a really small country and everything kind of looks the same everywhere there - pretty though, don\u2019t get me wrong.\n\nOverall not a bad first draft though",

Lisbon is really lively in June, there's Saint Anthony Festival and the streets are full of parties and festivities. Also you can take the train from Lisbon to the close towns of Cascais and Sintra which are quite different than central Lisbon and easy to reach. You can also swim and surf in/around Lisbon if that's why you chose to stay longer in Lagos.\n\nLagos is nice too but it's a small holiday town and you'd end up doing similar things for each of the 6 days you spend there.",

            "comment": "I would skip Hvar and do another island like Mljet, or add a trip to Mostar or even Ljubljana. Hvar is a very touristy place, and it is one of the most expensive places in Croatia. It's fun to go there with a group of friends since it also is a bit of a \"party\" island (club/bar life), but if you are more looking to enjoy nature it's not worth it. Brac and Korcula basically look the same as Hvar in terms of nature as well. But if you are more into the city/party life, then maybe Hvar is worth keeping :) just beware of the high prices there. \n\nMljet is a great option for doing cycling tours, and there is also the island of Vis, which is farther to get there, but it is amazing for scuba diving. \n\nIt also looks like you are only staying one night in Split, I would say its worth to stay there for an extra night. There's a lot to see in the center, and the Mall of Split is a nice stop to do some clothes shopping if you need. \n\nAnd I hope on Brac you get to stop in Pu\u010di\u0161\u0107a, its a very unique town made from the white stone that's associated with a lot of towns on the Dalmatia coast and the souvenirs they sell as well.\n\nI've been living in Croatia every summer for the past 10 years, also doing a bunch of island hopping and stuff like that. I hope my advice will help!",

Yes, Hvar is so expensive!! Nothing under 100$/night for a dorm. I have never heard about Mljet, will look into it. Just googled Pu\u010di\u0161\u0107a and it looks so cute!!

It\u2019s a great trip. It stopped for an hour in Venice, where the train station in right on the grand canal, so I got to do some decent sightseeing. \n\n- Bus from Trieste to Rovinj, Croatia. The Istrian Peninsula is pretty different from the Dalmatian coast. It\u2019s more Italian. Rovinj is a great little old city and has great food. \n\n- Rovinj to Pula (bus). There\u2019s an amazing Roman era colosseum in Pula. I got in late afternoon and left early the next am so didn\u2019t see much. \n\n- Pula to Zadar (short, cheap early am flight). Zadar is fantastic. Was there for a few days - that\u2019s when I took a day trip to Plitvice. \n\n-Bus from Zadar to Split. Split is great. I stayed in a cheap room that was actually in the inner wall of Diocletian Palace. It\u2019s a beautiful place. \n\n- Split to Korcula (fast ferry). For me, two days in Korcula was enough. Very pretty island but not much going on and it seemed couples/family oriented. \n\n- Korcula - Dubrovnik (ferry). You know all about Dubro. \n\n- Dubrovnik- Sarajevo by bus. Sarajevo seemed kind of edgy. Very interesting city though. \n\n- Sarajevo- Zagreb by bus. I liked Zagreb. Lively, artistic and young. \n\nThanks for letting me relive a great trip!",

I think everywhere else you\u2019ve done a nice job of making sure you have enough time to enjoy and not rush\u2026 this part is the one exception! \n\nZagreb definitely deserves at least a day, if not 2-3. I lived there for 4 months and loved every minute! Since you\u2019re not that into museums, it\u2019s lucky that lots of the good ones are quite small. The Naive Art Museum is one I haven\u2019t seen mentioned yet that is amazing\u2026 the art is painted backwards, on glass! Museum of Broken Relationships is excellent too, definitely not your typical museum.\n\nPlitvice also definitely deserves a whole day, and you\u2019ll likely have a better experience if you\u2019re there first thing in the morning to beat the day-tripping crowds. Like another commenter said, I\u2019d do at least 1.5-2.5 days in ZG, then take an afternoon bus and get settled in near Plitvice. Do Plitvice, then take the bus on to Split the next day. \n\nFinally, don\u2019t make the mistake that so many do of skipping Split just to get on a ferry! My two summers there were some of the best of my life, it\u2019s an incredible city. If you\u2019re looking for a fun &amp; friendly place to stay, Backpacker\u2019s Fairytale or Wonderful World Hostels are the best. I would definitely do 2-3 Split days before hopping on the ferry, and make sure to get out of the palace! \n\nEven without borrowing from any other countries, you could easily manage the above. I know you like beaches, but 5 days each on Bra\u010d and Kor\u010dula is A LOT. I would cut a couple days off of each of those to give to ZG &amp; Split. I also agree with others that Slovenia and Bosnia are both well worth visiting when you\u2019re already right there, so maybe save Nice, Malta, or one of the less along-the-way stops for another trip.",

I love Bosnia, and the bus to get there from the Croatian coast is seriously the most beautiful ride I\u2019ve taken in my life. Mostar would be an easier fit if you were bussing between Split &amp; Dubrovnik, but you\u2019re right that it\u2019s more out of the way as an excursion from either one - and fitting in Sarajevo too in 3 days would be very rushed. So yeah, maybe save that for another trip! In that case, I\u2019d add one of those three days each to Zagreb, Split, and the trip from Dubrovnik to Montenegro.

    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nI (27M) am planning a solo trip to the USA from August for roughly 3-6 months. My plan is tthe following:  \n\n* Start in Boston for 2 nights \n* Train/Bus to Chicago (maybe stopping somewhere along the way such as Cleveland).\n* Chicago for 3 nights\n* Route 66 - roughly 2-3 weeks\n   * Renting a car and looking for a travel buddy in Chicago (is this a good idea?) \n* Ending up in Southern California - skipping LA but going straight to San Diego\n* Mexico's west coast (1 week) - looking for a nice beach/party town not too far from the US\n* Then renting a car (in the USA again) and going up the West Coast to Oregon in time for Fall (4 weeks and slowly though Big Sur -&gt; North California -&gt; Portland -&gt; Seattle -&gt; Vancouver.\n\nI have a couple of questions:\n\n1. How is solo travel in the US? I don't think it will be as tourist friendly as SE Asia but are there any good tips or tricks to meet people? Is it the same as SE Asia where Hostels work well or are there other avenues to meet people?\n2. Are there any areas of the along the route I should avoid as a solo traveller? Not necessarily for safety reasons but I get the feeling some places might be unfriendly for tourists. For example, I'm looking a Cleveland for a night to stay and it doesnt seem as tourist friendly as somewhere like Boston.\n3. Any tips or ticks on doing the US on a budget would be great. I know it will be kinda of pricey (thinking roughly USD 100-200+ maybe more) per day (is that reasonable?). I dont mind (actually prefer) going to more rural places where things might be cheaper.\n\nIts a bit of a dream to travel the USA for me. Coming from South Africa, we always hear and watch US media and learn about parts of the different US Cultures. Now that I have worked a couple years to save some money, I am looking to soak it all in, learn about the different parts and meet some interesting people!\n\nPost edit: thank you for all the comments! Will take your advice seriously in due course! Awesome sub\ud83d\udc4d",

            "comment": "As an American who drove across South Africa a few years ago just love this trip idea. Don't worry after a few days driving you forget that you're on the wrong side of the road. :)\n\nSolo travel as commonly understood here really barely exists in the US sadly. Very few hostels, tours, etc compared to other countries. So be prepared to be truly solo for much of it. \n\nYour biggest expenses are going to be your vehicle and your housing. Boston and Chicago both are better without a car. It probably would be cheaper &amp; easier to just fly than drive honestly. If you do want to drive it, Cleveland or Pittsburgh are great stopovers. \n\nIf you're traveling May-Sept I would suggest ditching the Route 66 drive and instead go something like Chicago - Denver - Wyoming (Yellowstone) - Montana - Seattle route. Assuming it's the summer it's stunningly gorgeous going through the Rockies. And then you can head south into Oregon and the Redwoods of northern Cali. In the winter months Rt 66 through the desert would be better probably. If you want a Baja Mexican place I'd check out Ense\u00f1asda. Basically the next town south of Tijuana (which you should skip). \n\nAlso to save $$ on housing I'd stop by a Walmart and pickup some basic camping supplies like a tent, sleeping bag, etc. There's thousands of places you can camp in rural USA for like $10-20 a night.",

After traveling in Europe for a bit, I\u2019ve discovered this is a bit of a thing in places outside of America to think of Rout 66 as \u201cthe\u201d road trip. I honestly don\u2019t know where this came from. Maybe it was true in the 50s? The 70s? Certainly not while I\u2019ve been alive. We have a fantastic interstate system and Route 66 isn\u2019t much more than a couple of curiosity signs that you blow by at 85mph.\n\nInstead, I\u2019d encourage you to prioritize the National Parks if you\u2019re making a road trip through the middle US. You can very easily hit Yellowstone, Rocky Mountain, Arches &amp; Canyonlands, Zion, and the Grand Canyon all in one go (and you have the time). Plus, as someone already mentioned, you can camp so easily and cheaply in the western states - often inside the National parks depending when you get in (campgrounds are often half reserve and half first-come-first-serve).",

Or is it like a cultural thing? If you are looking for a highway to follow you would be much better off doing I-80 or I-90. Boston -&gt; Cleveland -&gt; Chicago -&gt; Denver or South Dakota (underrated imo)-&gt; Wyoming -&gt; Montana then either south or continue West to Seattle and drive or fly down to San Diego. Do some research on National Forest land, you can disperse camp for free if you have camping equipment. August will be HOT in the southern US, but is a great time of year to see the Rockies. Be aware that gas is very expensive right now as is renting a car. \n\nCleveland isn\u2019t exactly a touristy city but it\u2019s relatively cheap. I\u2019d recommend staying in Lakewood, The Flats, or Ohio City for the most fun things to do if you end up there but really I\u2019d recommend just using it as a one night stop",

I guess there are two ways to look at road trips: either you are driving as a way to get from Cool City One to Cool City Two as fast as possible - in which case, by all means, take the interstate, or, you are driving with the intention of enjoying the actual drive - in which case stay the hell off of the interstate. Unless you really dig an endless repetition of the same fast food chains and big box stores.\n\nSome of my favorite roads for driving for the sheer pleasure of the experience:\n\n1. Blue Ridge Parkway\n2. CA 1 from  Monterrey/Carmel to Gold Beach  / Route 101 in Oregon / Olympic Peninsula in Washington - or start even farther south and add on the PCH heading north from Malibu. (Note, I used to live in San Diego and I love it but the roads in and out of that city are uninteresting).\n3. Overseas highway in the Florida Keys...to maybe the Coastal Connection through Alabama (but you have to be pretty invested in the American South for this route...and preferably cisgendered, heterosexual, and white passing.\n4. Route 12 near Bryce Canyon in Utah\n5. Badlands Loop Road\n6. Trail Ridge road in Colorado - in summer, and only if you are definitely cool with driving on the right side of the road - also, if you are coming from the east, Kansas has some really underrated scenic byways.\n7. The High Road - Taos, New Mexico / Enchanted Circle\n8. If you do go to Chicago - Lake Shore Drive / Highway 41\n9. North to South State highway in Vermont - in Fall. It has to be in Fall.\n\nI guess the last thing I'd say is know who you are. I cannot imagine wanting to cross the country on an interstate. But....I guess people do?",

I absolutely LOVED seeing the desert in Nevada and Utah, doing Kingman Arizona (seeing old route 66 there), Antelope Canyon, the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley- so much to see! I zigzagged for days and couldn't believe the wide range of biodiversity once elevation changed. Like the Grand Canyon has giant huge trees and massive elk, then red rock and desert so close by. So I highly recommend you add in those areas in your Route 66 planning. I found everyone I encountered in the states to be so helpful and kind, even helping me to pump gas since pumping is different in Canada and US! Also a cool spot was Four Corners, where you can touch Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah all at once! Lastly, your idea to see the Fall leaves is amazing. I'm glad you're going to Vancouver. There is some amazing whale watching there and so many unique parts of the city. Have a wonderful time!",

Honestly you could do both if you have your heart set on it. I thought it was so cool seeing old route 66 :) In South Africa, I did Gansbaii for caves and shark diving, drove to Cape Agulhas to touch the Indian Ocean, did Cape Down and down to Good Hope, and then flew to Hoedspruit for safari.

They exist in the biggest cities that receive a lot of international tourists, but they tend to get booked up quickly. Many major metro areas will have few or no hostels. My hometown of Indianapolis, city pop 900k metro 2 million, has 0 hostels.\n\nThe cheap accommodation here is the **locally owned** motel. These are (usually) 1-2 story structures where the doorway to the room faces the outside. These tend to be mom/pop and no frills. But you really need to read the reviews. There are a few chains that compete in this space as well, such as Motel 6.\n\nIts pretty hard to find a city with nothing to do but Cleveland is a great visit. Great food scene, right along a Great Lake. There's a national park 20 minutes from downtown. Touristy stuff like Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Christmas Story house. Ohio has a lot of theme parks , some of which are accessible to Cleveland. Lots of things to do.\n\nThe US is generally not going to be a budget vacation and don't expect rural areas to necessarily be cheaper. If you roll up to northern Indiana during the Covered Bridge festival, every hotel will be sold out and anything you do find will be $250-300 a night. This applies to national parks during peak or anywhere that'll have seasonal events. Or in mid sized cities if there's like a big concert or the local pro sports team makes the playoffs, prices will skyrocket.\n\nThere are definitely things you can do to mitigate costs like using grocery stores, utilizing free days for museums, etc... But your money just won't be going as far as it will in Mexico, southeast Asia or Portugal.\n\nIf you want to meet Americans, just engage. Worst they an say is \"no thank you\".But honestly I've met friendly people in even the biggest cities that are stereotyped as being the coldest. You just need to be able to read people a bit and be a bit social. Or put yourself in situations with common interests such as group tours, bar seating/breweries/distilleries/wineries, public events, etc...",

Usually they rented them out for a day or two for people to move and the owner was a bit surprised when we asked if we could have one for a month. He made up a price on the spot, we accepted it (it was a quarter of the price of the cheapest campervan), and he gave us a brand new van, less than 50 miles on the clock.\n\nIt was just a shell, so we went to a thrift store where we decked the entire van out for a song. What we couldn't find in the thrift stores, we got at Walmart.\n\nThe best thing about it was that it was a plain white van (it had the company's sticker on one door), so we could stealth camp pretty much anywhere. The only time anything happened was being woken in the middle of the night by police in Minnesota. We'd pulled up in a reasonably full carpark, but it had emptied out during the night and nearby residents were suspicious of the yellow New York plates. They left us alone when they realised we were just some clueless Aussie tourists.\n\nIt was the best trip ever. Amazing memories of that van",

            "comment": "Probably the biggest cost-saving tip I can recommend is to do a *full one-month rental* on a car. Unbelievably more cost effective per day to do the full month.\n\nI've done it three times on road trips and it's been less than $900 each time. It looks like it's currently less than $700 in some places.\n\nA rental will be a newer model car, so you'll get much better gas mileage.\n\nThe US has plenty of truck stops that are generally staffed 24 hours, safe to sleep in, and have showers (but generally avoid sleeping at rest areas, which are unstaffed), so this is the way to do it cheap. I usually budgeted for a cheap motel every 4-5 days, or when needed.\n\nBudget some for extras (cooler in the back, snacks, some emergency equipment) and figure out what you need for insurance. Consider the climate, too - central Texas isn't northern Montana. :)\n\nIt may be cheaper at a non-airport rental company, and it's also cheaper if you drop off the car at the same location.\n\nIf you get a CostCo membership, you can get a discount from CostCo Travel on a rental that more than pays for the membership, and you can buy bulk snacks/drinks for your trip on the cheap (I also recommend dollar stores like Dollar General or Dollar Tree for cheap items). Play with CostCo Travel's rental search feature (multiple companies) to play with options.\n\nBest wishes and safe travels!",

A lot of them kinda suck and the people staying there aren't necessarily those that you'd want to be around. You might find a few good ones here and there, but I wouldn't count on it consistently.\n\nA good place to meet people is to find craft alcohol bars. Breweries, cideries, distilleries, etc. There's tons of them everywhere now. They tend to be more chill than traditional bars and if they aren't busy are usually great places to chat with people, even if it's just the bartender about what's cool to see in the area. Plus the drinks are much better!\n\nIf you don't drink it's a bit tougher, but meetup is also a good place to try to find events going on.\n\nIn terms of \"avoiding\", I mean Cleveland isn't exactly known as a famous tourist city, but I don't suspect people would be unfriendly there; if anything, probably friendlier than Boston, lol. I would say route 66 is not super exciting and doesn't need that much time and if you're gonna be out in the Southwest there are way better things I would spend those weeks doing. \n\nHonestly, Airbnb. I know reddit has a hate boner for it these days, but you can find nice Airbnbs for like 30-40 a night if you're not in a touristy area. Just be careful in a big city because they might be in bad neighborhoods.\n\nSan Diego is incredible and I'd spend more time there than in any other city in the entire US, honestly. But seeing the nature along the way is gonna be way more exciting than Route 66 itself, IMO.\n\nBe careful in Mexico, too. The areas near the US border tend to be more dangerous. I'm not sure of the current state of the country but I rarely hear good things these days.",

SE Asia is so ideal for solo travelers and I don\u2019t think the US is like that at all. Tbh I don\u2019t have experience in hostels in the US but I\u2019m sure that would be your best bet for meeting people. I think bars during happy hour or sports games are a great time/place to meet people. Also i would recommend hopping on bumble or hinge when you\u2019re in a city for more than a few days. I\u2019ve made platonic friends with people I\u2019ve met while traveling on the apps. Just don\u2019t be creepy! \n\n2. Cleveland isn\u2019t not tourist friendly it just isn\u2019t really a destination that people go to unless they have a specific reason. If you\u2019re just staying over for a night out of convenience you\u2019ll be fine but don\u2019t expect it to be a highlight of your trip. \n\n3. I would budget more especially since you\u2019re road-tripping for a good portion. You\u2019ll be spending a lot on gas and (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) there won\u2019t really be hostels along your route. The US is insanely expensive compared to SE Asia. I would suggest looking up restaurants in Boston, San Diego etc and looking at their prices so you can get a feel for how much things costs. I think you could cut down on costs while you drive by stocking up on snacks and lunch foods at a grocery story vs getting stuff at a gas station or restaurant. It might even be worth getting a small cooler for the car. I usually do that for long road trips. \n\nI think you\u2019ve got a pretty solid itinerary on your hands and will have a great time! \n\nPs I live in San Francisco so I can give you specific recs for Northern California if you dm me",

Hostels do exist, but not necessarily in abundant quantities. Lola Pass in Portland's pretty good, as is a capsule one in DC.\n\nIf you take Amtrak, expect delays. Most of the Amtrak network does not run on government-owned rail. Also, the frequency on many routes is abysmal. Boston -&gt; DC only runs once a day. Amtrak tickets get more expensive (and sometimes sell out) the closer you get to your travel date, so buy early!\n\nThe country is huge. To drive from Albany to Buffalo is 4 1/2 hours without stopping. The train adds an additional hour. Portland to Seattle is 3 hours. Big Sur to Portland is 12 1/2. Depending on where you are in the US, people refer to driving time rather than distance. In the cities, this is not a long distance, but it's the opposite in the countryside. \n\nMany of the best places are outside of the cities. Outside of most city centers you will need a car, and people will not yield to you. I think you've got the right ideas on when to rent a car. \n\nParking in cities can be as high as $30/hour (for major ones), or free. Rental cars themselves can be quite expensive. Before deciding on hostel/city center hotel vs non-city center hotel and car, compare costs. Often the city center ends up being a wash. Tip: Some of the cheaper hotels are near the airports and require a car.\n\nYou will have to go through customs to enter/exit Mexico and Canada. Plan extra time at the boarder. \n\nMost people in the US are friendly, and willing to say \"hello!\" whether it's on the bus, train, beach, etc. Trivia nights are pretty popular over here too.\n\nHave fun!

When your renting your vehicles you could do a minivan or suv, buy a cheap sleeping bag and sleeping pad from Walmart, then go around do a mixture of car camping along your route and staying in hotels and hostels if you can find them.",

            "comment": "Instead of renting a car and paying for motels (hostels aren't really a thing outside places like NYC and LA or other really big cities) you may consider renting a small RV van or something similar. There's companies that use mini vans and convert them into full-on campers complete with kitchens. These can go anywhere regular cars can, can be pretty fuel efficient and gives you the option to travel at your leisure without needing to worry about booking accommodations or catching a train/bus etc.\n\nAs others have said, Mexico near the border can be dangerous. The USA recently updated travel advisories for folks and we've had several high profile cases involving American's being kidnapped and murdered by cartels there. I would not recommend taking an American rental vehicle into Mexico. It makes you a target. You might consider parking at the border and renting a vehicle once you cross over. It may also be worth checking into a 3-day cruise of Baha California. Cruises have been insanely cheap the last few years and most of them offer excursions when docked. This can be a much safer way to explore Mexico.\n\nGood luck and I hope you enjoy your holiday here!",

I'd spend at least 4 nights in Chicago.  There are a lot of free things to do in Chicago.  Great beer city if you're into beer.  It's easy to get to a place called Headquarters in Chicago.  Great beer selection with free to play new and classic arcade games.  Have to drink Mal\u00f6rt while you're in Chicago.  Don't need a car.  Too much time and money will be spent on parking.  Public transit is good in Chicago.  When I say it's good I mean for the US for Chicago and other places below.\n\nMight be fun to see people getting yelled at here:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAMC47sxMVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAMC47sxMVE)\n\nDon't have to buy anything there.  It's not a place people go for food.  If you're near by and there during a heavy drinking night which is every weekend and every Cubs home game, might be fun to see the piss taken out of the locals.\n\nHave you heard of Flixbus?  Unless one's goal is to be able to say they drove from x to y.  Can get from Portland to Seattle for around $25.  In fact I'd use Flixbus to save money and not have to drive where possible.  The buses are setup better for checking out the scenery vs driving oneself in a car or even being a passenger in a regular car.  \n\n[https://shop.flixbus.com/search?departureCity=b9fa6246-6357-4560-a618-f2cebc3ece75&amp;arrivalCity=e449edce-f86a-4ddd-8d24-fc2af4ef5f6e&amp;route=Portland%2C+OR-Seattle%2C+WA&amp;rideDate=02.06.2023&amp;adult=1&amp;\\_locale=en\\_US&amp;features%5Bfeature.darken\\_page%5D=1&amp;features%5Bfeature.enable\\_distribusion%5D=1&amp;features%5Bfeature.train\\_cities\\_only%5D=0&amp;features%5Bfeature.webc\\_search\\_persistent\\_explore\\_map%5D=0&amp;atb\\_pdid=7b184535-1397-4768-a393-75ecca599961&amp;\\_sp=13b51e80-f2f3-4aec-8dde-087d9e902b1f&amp;\\_spnuid=eb791c89-2dad-47a1-82d6-ff6bfbca3f4b](https://shop.flixbus.com/search?departureCity=b9fa6246-6357-4560-a618-f2cebc3ece75&amp;arrivalCity=e449edce-f86a-4ddd-8d24-fc2af4ef5f6e&amp;route=Portland%2C+OR-Seattle%2C+WA&amp;rideDate=02.06.2023&amp;adult=1&amp;_locale=en_US&amp;features%5Bfeature.darken_page%5D=1&amp;features%5Bfeature.enable_distribusion%5D=1&amp;features%5Bfeature.train_cities_only%5D=0&amp;features%5Bfeature.webc_search_persistent_explore_map%5D=0&amp;atb_pdid=7b184535-1397-4768-a393-75ecca599961&amp;_sp=13b51e80-f2f3-4aec-8dde-087d9e902b1f&amp;_spnuid=eb791c89-2dad-47a1-82d6-ff6bfbca3f4b)\n\nGetting from Seattle to Vancouver, BC (did you know just across the river from Portland, OR there's a city named Vancouver as well?  I'm sure you mean Vancouver in Canada and not the US), take one of the ferries over.  It's more of an authentic travel experience in my opinion vs waiting in a line of cars.\n\nNorth California - not sure if that includes San Francisco and the Bay Area.\n\n**Do not drive your rental car into the Bay Area.**  **It will get broken into and set you back a few hundred dollars and take time away from your trip dealing with unpleasant things.**  Do not leave anything in your car even if it has low or no value.  People will break into your car just to have a look.  The only scenario where one should drive into the Bay Area is to drop off the rental car right as one arrives.  Watch out for the rental car hours.  Traffic will not work in your favor if you're trying to time dropping off the car right before it closes.\n\nAlso parking in San Francisco is a pain.  Spend lots of time and money looking for parking.  Public transpiration is good enough for visitors within SF.\n\nPortland... the public transportation is awesome there compared to the Bay Area and also has car break ins.  The most one can pay in a day is $5 if you use the same credit/debit card to pay.  The Bay Area... $2 is the least one can pay for the shortest rides.  I think there are concessions for certain people for public transportation but would be surprised if you qualified to get a break in the prices.  The BeerMongers which is in the Southeast of Portland is a great beer focused bar.  The SE part of the city is probably my favorite.\n\nI'd probably get accommodations on the eastern bank of the Willamette River... within walking distance of the Lloyd Center.  There's a place called Sassy's that has $4 pints during their long happy hours. \n\nSeattle... don't get a car spend too much time looking for and paying for parking.  Also lots of car break ins.  Might be able to save money if you get accommodations in or near the Fremont neighborhood.  Approximately 30 mins away via public transportation from Fremont to Pike Place.  The Ballard neighborhood if you want to check out many breweries in one afternoon.  Fair Isle are doing some amazing things and breaking the mold for beers made in the area.\n\nDick's Drive-In for local tasty and reasonably priced food.  I'm from California but I would trade In N Out for Dick's Drive-In.  Not sure why but I check out the gum wall every visit to Seattle.  There are a lot of odd things in Seattle and Portland I gravitate toward vs more typical culture stuff like museums.\n\nThe locals in both Seattle and Portland have what's called Seattle Freeze.  They're polite to outsiders but not really engaging.  If you stay at hostels with other travelers I think you should be fine.  Maybe connect with a few people at he hostel in Portland to take a car out for a day or two to see the OR coast.\n\nYou might burn through a lot more money in the Bay Area and Seattle than the other parts of your trip.  I was in Europe earlier this month (Paris, Rome and some other places)... felt like everything was cheap compared to the Bay Area and Seattle.  I paid $150 per night for a hotel in Milan that had slippers for my room, giant bathroom and fantastic location... place like that would have cost $500 per night in the Bay Area or Seattle.\n\nIn any case, sounds like a great trip.",

Happy to share any tips/suggestions if you want.    \n\nAnd I echo all the recommendations on prioritizing visiting national parks. That is one of the great beauties of the US: so much nature to see. Camping would be an affordable and exciting way to explore. \n\nLastly, I\u2019ve visited hostels in the US\u2026 actually most of my solo travels here have me staying at hostels for budget purposes. Airbnbs are super pricey and hotels are more affordable than those, but hostels are worth looking into for the cheapest out of the three imo. I use them in major cities and have always had a good experience, especially meeting people. \n\nI think group activities (such as Airbnb experiences) or free tours are great ways to meet people.

There's nicer buses between Boston-NYC, but if you're talking Greyhound it's pretty nasty, bad service, uncomfortable buses. I think you could probably find a  plane fare from Boston/NYC to Chicago that would be comparably priced. I have no idea why you would want to go to Cleveland; Boston or NYC are way better. Philly or Pittsburgh would be nicer, tho Chicago is wonderful. \n\nI drove several times between Chicago and west coast (highways, not Rt 66) and it's dreary. I can't imagine doing that for 3 weeks. It's going to be deathly hot in August, and I don't know what I would do in these tiny towns out there. The national parks in Grand Canyon, UT etc are spectacular, not sure if they're why you're driving. \n\nImo, no idea why you would pick San Diego over LA. LA is one of my fave cities, up there with SF.  Big Sur is spectacular-- the most beautiful place in the world imo. And get a camping site there if you can, where you can sleep under the redwoods. Incredible experience. Hwy 1 is also great between LA and Sf, but north of SF it gets to be twisty and windy. Beautiful but it gets old real fast if you want to get somewhere. \n\nVancouver is also incredibly beautiful.  Portland/Seattle also great, but not as great as Vancouver.",

San Diego is amazing, I would highly recommend driving getting to the 1 highway near San Fran and driving that down the coast: it\u2019s stunning. \n\nBe sure that when you do eat out do it at mom and pop stops off the beaten path!\nHave fun if you have any questions reach out!",

Hostels, with the exception of a select few in very touristy cities like NYC, are pretty shitty. Overpriced and they often attract those down on their luck since it's the cheapest roof they can have over their heads for a night or two without being on the street so as you can imagine, the atmosphere in these hostels isn't great.\n\nI did a lot of Couchsurfing when I was traveling the US so I often had a contact in the cities I was in and if that wasn't the case, then I also used dating apps or simply just went to bars on my own and talked to people.\n\n2) No specific areas that come to mind, but I will say that I found Cleveland to be a shithole so if you can avoid it, that would be best lmao. Just my opinion though. Check my post for other cities I didn't particularly enjoy.\n\n3) Check my trip report as I gave a decent amount of tips that helped me keep my expenses under $100 a day for my 4 month roadtrip.",

            "comment": "you're gonna have an amazing time.\n\nthe US is big - you'll notice a cultural difference between the east and west coasts as far as how friendly people are and how easy it is to find someone to adventure with. on the west coat (san francisco, portland) i've stayed at some awesome hostels with a social focus (group dinners, game rooms) and I've witnessed people making friends but honestly, thinking about it, I never actually went out and explored with anyone for the day. whereas in asia i think i was pretty much always with people i'd just met at the hostel.\n\nI think $100/day is pretty reasonable for bed and food (depending on the city and if youre eating out VS deli food). Add more for transit and activities.\n\nOne consideration - getting around is going to be hard. Our public transit is terrible, our buses/trains are terrible. You're planning to rent a car which gives you a lot of freedom, but have you ever driven that much for that long that often? It's really hard to drive along the highway for 14 hours... just consider it, break driving sections up around your trip. And maybe treat yourself to a couple flights here and there, prevent fatigue.\n\nDon't miss out on national parks!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a Brit and I\u2019m currently travelling the US on solo travel. \n\nI\u2019m just finishing going up the East Coast (Miami, Orlando, Savannah, Charleston, D.C., Philadelphia) and I\u2019m about to do the West Coast (Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco, LA). I\u2019m travelling only by train and plane so I can\u2019t comment on the driving side. A few points:\n\n1. It will be more expensive than you think. Most attractions here cost money, whether historical, museums, national parks. There\u2019s a fee for almost everything. The only free activities I\u2019ve found really were the museums in D.C. \n\n2. Don\u2019t forget about tipping when budgeting. Wherever you buy food/drinks at a restaurant/cafe/bar, add 20% to whatever you think it\u2019ll cost. That\u2019s the standard and it starts to add up more than you might think.\n\n3. Hostels. Many major cities have them and I have found excellent ones nearly everywhere on my trip. Several cities, simply won\u2019t. It\u2019s not like Europe or SE Asia. I\u2019ve found all the hostels to be clean, welcoming and sociable, both with Americans and foreigners. If you read the reviews and pick the right ones, many don\u2019t allow locals so you won\u2019t be stuck with the homeless/other shady types. \n\n4. If you can\u2019t find hostels, you\u2019ll probably turn to motels. This could well be the play but based on all the research I did for my trip, anywhere at a competitive price was probably unpleasant. Review are very much your friend, check google reviews AND TripAdvisor. Sometimes AirBnB will be your only affordable option other than hotels. Read the reviews, do your research and definitely book individual rooms in someone\u2019s house, it\u2019s wayyy cheaper than your own place. I\u2019ve done it twice on this trip and both were good experiences. \n\n5. You mention that you have a car but within cities, I\u2019ve found biking to be the best way to get around. You get to see the city (unlike the metro), don\u2019t get stuck in traffic (unlike buses or cars) and is decently fast (unlike walking. The US is the least walkable country I\u2019ve ever visited). Many cities have apps for bike rental but I\u2019d suggest finding a local bike shop that does rentals and doing a multi day rental with them, it\u2019s usually the cheapest option.\n\n6. For food, buying in supermarkets will likely be expensive or cheap and unhealthy but I haven\u2019t taken this option much. \n\n7. Trains will be delayed and YOU MUST GET THERE EARLY. Amtrak has airplane style boarding, not just a hop-on like you\u2019d find in Europe. If you turn up with 5-10 mins till departure you may find the doors are closed. Aim for a minimum of 30 mins early. \n\n8. I\u2019m very much an anti-tour person, I prefer to explore on my own, but I\u2019ve found that the US ones are typically better done than elsewhere in the world and guides are knowledgeable and friendly. Just don\u2019t forget to tip!\n\n9. Would recommend Mint Mobile for unlimited data. Reasonably priced and good service.\n\nAny other questions just ask or DM. I\u2019m on the road for another three weeks so can let you know any changes!",

I always catch an international flight to places with the accomodations and backpacker infrastructure to save a ton and do more stuff cheaper w/ no responsibility.\n\nIn the US there are some cities that have hostels (though can have a sketchy crowd - hard drug addicts and stuff) and public transit - but to do the cool nature oriented stuff outside the city or visit small towns need a car, no hostels etc.\n\nBest tip to save money would buy a cheap electric stove top, sleep in your car and maybe sign up for a cheap gym chain to shower. Maybe a small hammock w rain cover to take advantage of camping spots. I could imagine 3 months in the US traveling around in car and cheapest accomodations easily costing 5-10K+ USD if you don't get extreme with your cost cutting.",

But my understanding is all the main commercial areas in/around the Loop are fine.)\n\nAmericans like tourists, and people will probably like you even more in places that don't get many tourists (Cleveland) because you'll be a novelty.\n\nIf you are driving or taking the bus from Boston to Chicago, don't go to Gary, Indiana (or if the bus stops there, don't get out).  Not a safe or happy place.\n\nBuses: I have had good experiences on inter-city buses but you should be aware that there are sometimes sketchy people on the buses.  Taking the bus is the cheapest option so it has the reputation as being the option for the desperate.  (The exception is the East Coast, where lots of people take inter-city buses between DC-Philadelphia-NYC-Boston).  Also research the bus schedules - inter-city buses tend to stop at lots of small towns along the way and so it'll take much longer to ride the bus from Boston to Chicago than it will to drive.\n\nLong-distance train service in the U.S. is not as convenient or efficient as in Europe but it works really well and will get you from Boston to Chicago faster than the bus.  I also find Amtrak enjoyable.\n\nDriving from Boston to Chicago is doable; it'll take a long time but maybe that'll be part of the charm.\n\nNiagara Falls is on the way from Boston to Chicago (if you're driving) and is probably worth stopping.  The conventional wisdom is that the view on the Canadian side is better, so maybe research and prepare for crossing into Canada.\n\nMeeting people: I have no idea what the hostel scene is like in the U.S. but both Boston and Chicago have several colleges in the city, so go to those neighborhoods for outgoing young people that you can probably chat up.\n\nSaving money: You can probably save some money by going to the grocery store and buying ingredients for sandwiches or something you don't have to cook.  Grocery stores also sell prepared foods, and it'll cost less than a restaurant.  Chicago has a large Mexican population and imho Mexican food is the most nutritious cheap cuisine (and delicious).  McDonald's isn't good for you but it's tasty and cheap.  Cities with large populations of blue-collar workers (Cleveland... also sorta Chicago) will have lots of good hearty breakfast offerings at diners, that might be worth checking out.\n\nI don't know the Southwest that well but I agree with everyone here who posted that you should do national parks.  \n\nMy unsolicited suggestion to you, as someone traveling the whole country and with a lot of time on your hands... consider going to New Orleans.  Honestly I think it's the best destination in the whole country.",

I have solo traveled and stayed at a hostel in NoLa, met some cool people there, and I've wwoofed solo and met people that way. I'm going to be staying at Homestel in Boston, and I'd also recommend Black Elephant in Maine. \n\nYou can take Amtrak along Route 66. It might be fun, plus you can sleep on the train/do other things instead of driving! Driving cross country can get exhausting. \n\nNorthwest coast in the fall is a great idea.

I have a client there and traveled there many times.  I especially like St Paul, which has a number of historic buildings.  Alternatively, if you are going in the summer, consider Michigan, especially the side against Lake Michigan.  Any city/town on the lake is nice but Luddington is particularly pretty.\n\nWhen you get to Seattle--my town--here are some budget-friendly things to do:\n\n* Go to Pike Place market.  If you don't buy anything, its free and the people-watching is amazing\n* Go to the first Starbucks (its near PP market.)  For the price of a cup of coffee, you get to be the place where US caffeine addiction started :)\n* If you want to get a cheap meal that is classically Seattle, go to Dick's Drive-In (there are a few of them.)  Order a Dick's Deluxe and a strawberry milkshake. Pagliacci pizza is also classically Seattle\n* Ride the ferries - they are very inexpensive as a walk-on passenger.  You can either ride over and back w/o getting off or go over, maybe have lunch and then come back.  Bainbridge Island is lovely for this\n* Do a hike - we have a gazillion beautiful hikes for any time of the year.  Most are free or there is a nominal fee to park. Since you are going to work your way north through WA, consider getting off I-5 at Mt Vernon, go west and get on Chuckanut Drive.  That will take you up to Bellingham (which you would go thru on I-5 anyways) and it is right on the coast.  The views are amazing.  Larabee State Park is on this road and it is a nice place to stop and stretch your legs and, if you don't mind the bracing waters of the Puget Sound, take a dip\n* Between Bellingham and the Canadian border is a place called Birch Bay.  That is also very pretty and lovely to visit",

Boston and Chicago both have Hostelling International hostels if you are looking for inexpensive lodging and they are centrally located and near public transportation. Are you interested in going to NYC, DC, or Philadelphia at all? Or just Boston?\n\nAs others have said, I-90 and I-80 are better driving routes than route 66. Personally, I would take I-90, it is a more interesting drive. When I drove it from Chicago to Seattle, I stopped in Madison WI, Sioux Falls SD, Mt. Rushmore, and Bozeman MT. It goes through Yellowstone National Park. You can also stop off in Spokane. You can get from Seattle to Portland OR by train or bus. \n\nOthers would need to advise on California. I have only been once, to the SF Bay area.",

I stayed in the HI Hostels on the east coast (New York and Boston) and they were great for meeting people and an independent hostel in New Orleans which was a lot of fun! I would definitely recommend looking into hostels for the locations you're planning on staying in just do your research first, same as any accommodation. I'm not sure what the hostels are like on the west coast but I stayed in a really fun cabin complex just outside of Yosemite. Also crossed the border from San Diego into Mexico for dinner one night, everyone we met was really friendly. Did a short trip from Vegas down route 66 to the southern point of the grand canyon, it was an amazing drive, I'm from the UK and we just don't have expanses of wilderness like that here, and I got to see there Hoover dam and lake mead both of which are stunning.

Also you can camp for free or nearly free in remote Bureau of Land Management land if you are comfotable camping by yourself with no campground.  For your budget - in big cities look for hostels otherwise hotels are very expensive.  On the road and in small cities / towns, cheap motels  such as Red Roof Inn, Super 8, Motel 6 will be your cheapest options for a bed and a shower.  Security can be questionable at some of these cheaper motels, but many are very safe.  Never leave valuables visible in your car.  Put them in the trunk and lock your doors.  For peace of mind, fill up your gas tank when you are half full.  Depending where you are, the next gas station could be a long way off.  For meeting people - maybe attend events based on your hobbies.  Meetup com. If you start learning to salsa dance, many big cities have a lot of salsa dances where obviously you will talk to a lot of strangers in a pretty safe environment.  In restaurants, sit at the bar if you are by yourself rather than taking up a whole table, and you may also be able to have conversations with others.",

            "comment": "I am American, but my wife &amp; I just did about 3 months road-tripping around the USA as part of a longer \\~1-year trip. There are already a ton of good tips in here, but I wanted to add a couple notes and share some personal experiences.\n\n**Car Rentals**\n\nI haven't seen anyone mention this yet. One-way car rentals often have a **huge** fee, especially at long distances From Vegas to LA or similar probably has many more possibilities, but for a month-long cross-country rental, this fee could be just as high as the rental itself. When we first started planning, we wanted to rent in California &amp; drop off in Miami or vice versa and nearly every car rental tacked on \\~$500 extra. There are some exceptions, but it's worth keeping in mind. What we ended up doing is a few smaller loops from LA, Denver, and around Florida. You might want to consider something similar - e.g., from Chicago, fly to Denver, Vegas, LA and do a few small or one big loop before continuing on.\n\nDon't forget to factor in extra costs.\n\n* Many rental agencies don't include additional costs in their quotes, such as insurance (often at least liability insurance is a requirement for rental)\n* You probably need a credit card to rent. In general, it's a good idea to get one if you don't have one anyway. They have much better protections than debit cards do.\n* Gas might be just as much as the rental or even more with as much driving as you'd like to do. Get apps like GasBuddy &amp; Upside to help save there.\n* Consider a \"car sharing\" like Turo, but be careful about insurances there. I believe they have liability included, but if you want collision damage covered you may need to add on an extra package.\n\n**Camping / Lodging**\n\nA couple people have mentioned renting a camper van, large car, or buying supplies at Walmart or similar. In the end, for \\~3 months in the US, we spent around $70 per day for the two of us. We stayed with friends and family a good bit and borrowed cars for a decent chunk of the trip, but we also saved a **ton** of money by camping and staying flexible where. Most campgrounds cost between $10-30 and many do not require pre-reservations unless they are in popular &amp; high-season areas. In National Parks or near especially popular regions, especially in summer, weekends, &amp; holidays, you'll probably need to book in advance, sometimes weeks or even months. We didn't always get our first choice and spent a decent amount of time searching for campgrounds, but we never booked anything more than a few days in advance and were able to find something without too much trouble or cost.\n\nThere are also a ton of possibilities for free \"wild camping\", especially in national forests. These won't have proper facilities like bathrooms, showers, etc., but do often have campfire rings and occasionally outhouses are available nearby as well. Great for 1-3 day stops here and there. Some of the pay ones actually can have some pretty nice facilities. A reasonably priced tent, sleeping bag &amp; blanket would easily pay for themselves after 2 nights camping instead of getting a hotel. \n\nYou can save to some extent by cooking at the campsites, but don't forget to factor in firewood. Sometimes, especially while wild camping, you can find your own lumber, but in pay campgrounds you'll often spend $5-10 per night to build a fire. Even so, we cooked some amazing steaks with foil-wrapped baked potatoes a few times for maybe $10 or so for two people, and stuff like hotdogs/sausages can be even cheaper. If you want to go that route, you could buy a small cooler and bags of ice each day to help food carry over multiple days. At the end of the trip, you could theoretically try to resell or give away the tent via something like Craigslist in your final destination, or donate to a homeless support organization or a second-hand shop like Goodwill.\n\nWe also really just enjoyed the camping experience &amp; nature - though obviously going it solo is different than with a partner, so that aspect will depend a lot on your interests &amp; personality.\n\nIf you do go the camping route:\n\n* Don't forget to check overnight weather forecasts. In 11 months of traveling, our coldest moments (around -3deg C one night) were actually in Arizona near the Grand Canyon and we were not really properly prepared. Luckily we had borrowed an extra sleeping bag and some blankets for that portion.\n* If you choose to do smaller loops, you will need to check a bag if you have a tent. The stakes &amp; poles will not be allowed for carry-on. You may also need to be careful if you buy a knife to help with cooking, etc. Southwest Airlines is a budget airline which includes checked bags in the prices, so that could be a good consideration.\n\n**Hotels**\n\n* Having a car is a big advantage. Hotels in cities can be quite insane, often $200 or more per night, but finding ones more in the $100 range in smaller towns or rural areas can be done. When you do want to go into cities:\n* Make sure you also consider parking costs when deciding on places to stay. In San Fransisco, less than $30 per day was nearly impossible. In some cities, it may be worth staying a bit outside and commuting in when needed, either by bus/train (if possible), Uber/Taxi, or driving yourself and finding short-term parking.\n* Think about booking a good amount in advance. If you want to stay flexible there are often options for refundable rates which cost a bit more but allow cancellation up until 1 day before checkin or so. \n\n**Random**\n\n* If you are a drinker, you might need your passport at bars/restaurants. Other international IDs are not often accepted and you're young enough that there's a good chance you'll get carded most of the time. Multiply this advice if you are near any universities.\n* Get yourself a SIM card when you first arrive in Boston. Especially if you decide to stay more flexible and book last minute and if you want to do camping. Having internet access for this and navigation can be a life-saver (possibly even literally in some of the more remote areas in the west). T-Mobile usually has the best options for tourists/prepaid. We got one in March for $40 a month, including unlimited data. They also have some smaller plans where you'll pay an activation fee, which might be a better deal for a longer stay if you don't think you'll use it much. If you go with a limited data option, start your navigation at the start of long drives and then disable your mobile data. You can also turn it on &amp; off briefly here and there to get updates or find gas/food, etc. You might end up missing on some ETAs a bit due to traffic &amp; accidents, but the constant traffic data fetching, recalculating routes, etc. eats up a ton of data.",

    "postText": "Hi guys!!! I'm planning to travel alone this year for the first time in my life (23 M, from the Netherlands). I want to share with you my current itinerary, so you can give me tips or comments if you want. I would also like to hear from you guys, what are the main sights and places.\n\nPortugal is a country I have wanted to be in for a long time. It is a country with many differences to my home country, but also with many interesting similarities.\n\nI found out that I know almost nothing about the history of the country. I know that the first explorers came from here and since this is a period in history that appeals to me I want to learn more about it. I want to get to know the culture, the people and the architecture. I also like to meet new people. I feel that many young people and solo travelers go to Portugal, is this true? Do you have the same experience?\n\n***Porto, Portugal (days 1-4)***\n\nI want to spend the first days in the northern city of Porto. Here I plan at least a city tour and a boat trip, as well as a day in Braga. but otherwise I am open to suggestions.\n\n***Aveiro, Portugal (Day 5)***\n\nI don't plan to stay here for long, mainly also because I'm not sure if I want to visit this place. But it's on the route, so it can't hurt to explore this city. My plan is to take the train here in the morning and continue to Coimbra in the evening, where I will sleep. I think a boat ride in Aveiro would be fun and maybe lay on the beach. Again, I am open to suggestions.\n\n***Coimbra (Day 6)***\n\nThis is another city I don't know yet. It is on the route but maybe someone can tell me more about the town? I know there is a very nice university there, but if that's all, I'd rather keep traveling I think.\n\n***Lisbon, Portugal (days 7-11)***\n\nLisbon is a city I really want to visit. I think I could spend a few days here just wandering around the city. I had found a travel guide online from which I picked out some interesting points ([Get Your Guide - 48 hours in Lisbon](https://www.getyourguide.com/lisbon-l42/itinerary-48-hours-in-lisbon)), but otherwise I'm still open to suggestions.\n\n***Lagos, Portugal (days 12-13)***\n\nThis is the part of the vacation where I mainly want to relax on the beach, plus there are plenty of water activities, and I would also like to watch dolphins and explore the caves. A cocktail in the right hand and sunscreen in the left, what more could you ask for?\n\n***Seville, Spain (Days 14-16)***\n\nDay 14 is a travel day because these two cities are not around the corner. There are actually two reasons why I want to go to Seville anyway: first, Seville has an airport from which I can take a direct flight home (Amsterdam). That's also possible from Faro or Lisbon, but I saw on the map that the distance isn't that big, so I figured screw it. Secondly, I'm also a big fan of the local football club Real Betis. The stadium is one of the places on my bucket list. My mom was in Seville a few years ago and also gave me some tips, for example the Royal Alcazar, but otherwise I'm still open to suggestions....\n\nThanks for reading and save travels!",

They have a nice farmers market there on Saturdays. EDIT: reached by train from Porto, in case it's not obvious.\n\nIf you want to understand the history of Portugal, it's worthwhile to spend a day or two in Coimbra. One of my favorite cities I have visited in Portugal.\n\nFrom Lisbon, I would suggest day trips to Sintra and \u00c9vora, since you have 5 days there. I think \u00c9vora deserves more than just a day, but with just two weeks I think that's all you have time for.\n\nLagos makes sense if you're traveling by train, but there are better places to stay in Algarve. Carvoiero is really nice with a beautiful beach and excellent access to hiking trails along the cliffs. Magical place. I also liked Ferragudo and Tavira, both beach towns small enough to be charming while having ample amenities to spend a few days. Tavira is also only 2 hours by train or car to Seville. \n\nHave a great trip. I'm sure you will be swept away by the beauty and magic of Portugal!",

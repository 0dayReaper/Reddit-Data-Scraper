    "postText": "Hi fellow solotravelers!\n\nNot a native english speaker, sorry if there are grammatical errors)\n\nI'm planning a itinerary from mid june to late june starting in Tirana, Albania (flight from Madrid).\n\nHere you have what I have planned, with some information about transportation (bus timings, for example):\n\n12/06/2023 albania tirana\n\n13/06/2023 albania tirana\n\n14/06/2023 albania tirana to sarande (4 hs)\n\n15/06/2023 albania sarande/ksamil beach\n\n16/06/2023 albania sarande/gjirokaster\n\n17/06/2023 albania dhermi\n\n18/06/2023 albania vlore\n\n19/06/2023 albania vlore\n\n20/06/2023 albania vlore to shkoder (4 hs)\n\n21/06/2023 shkoder-kotor bus to kotor (4 hs)\n\n22/06/2023 kotor-dubrovnik bus to dubrovnik (2 hs)\n\n23/06/2023 dubrovnik\n\n24/06/2023 dubrovnik-split bus to split (4 hs)\n\n25/06/2023 split\n\n26/06/2023 split-zadar night bus to zadar (2 hs)\n\n27/06/2023 zadar/mallorca flight to mallorca 2.30 pm\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know it's kinda packed between kotor and split with all the hours in buses, but I do want to visit at least one full day in kotor and dubrovnik.\n\nRegarding Albania, my plan is to relax at the beaches and maybe some nightlife like beers at a pub or something like that.\n\nAnd as for Split/Zadar probably visit some of the small islands and just relax a bit at the beaches too!\n\nHappy to read any advice or suggestions :)",

Moving every other day is tough, and I inevitably you have to miss something cool.\n\nI've also noticed my desire to see all the little side stuff fades when I settle into a country. \n\nOn another note, make time to visit Mostar from one of Split or Dubrovnik. It's absurdly gorgeous and Bosnia is very cool.",

It doesn't make sense to down south just to go back up north again. \nI would stay 1 night in Tirana, \n2 nights in Vlore, \n3 nights in Saranda with daytrips,\n2 nights in Tirana and then finally Skhoder 2 nights\n\nThe bus Tirana-Vlore is 3 hours. Tirana-Skhoder 2 hours. Tirana-Saranda 5 hours. Vlore-Skhoder will not be a direct bus. So keep in mind waiting for the bus. Busses usually loosely follow the timetables. With many only leaving when full.",

So I would say replace sarande and ksamil with Himare",

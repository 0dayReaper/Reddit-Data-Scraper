Problem is, I read some other threads about Japan, and they all suggest that Japan is kind of an antisocial place for solo travelers. And this was pre-Covid...I imagine after all the Covid restrictions it will be even worse\n\nI usually don't have problems making friends while traveling, but I'm too shy to make the first move. I always wait for other travelers or locals to talk to me first. Is that going to be an issue in Japan?",

Izakaya or local restaurants can be a fun place to mingle with locals as well as travelers. \n\nI\u2019m Japanese who grew up in Japan so it might be that experience is different for visitors? :)\n\nHope you have a good time there, happy solo traveling!",

I know it can be nerve wrecking to start a conversation with a stranger like this but I also believe that if you want to have social interactions you need to step out of your comfort zone.\n\nAs with locals, I found that in certain places me being alone made it interesting for Japanese to start conversations with me. Mind you, this was not on the busy streets of Tokyo or Osaka, but while I was in more quiter places. For example while sitting on a bench across the A-bomb dome in Hiroshima an older man came up to me and we started talking. Then a mother with her daughter also joined in the conversation and we had a nice talk. Another time someone asked me to take their picture and we spoke for a while.\n\nYou can also go to bars if that's something you like.",

In my two weeks there in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Hiroshima I met up only with one other solo traveler, so lots of dinners and exploring alone. It's a different experience, not necessarily a social one but nonetheless very fun! If you're looking for the type of buzzing social atmosphere that there usually is in European hostels for example, you won't find that as the average traveler you'll meet in Japan is a bit older, not travelling alone and not as spontaneous (usually following a well established itinerary). But do go for the incredibly unique culture, food and diversity in things to see and do.",

Alongside any of the larger metro cities in Japan are similar to large metros all over the world, people begin to be more isolated and wary of strangers.  While most Japanese know some elementary english, they are not fond of speaking due to embarrassment but if you're really in need of help, they will try to assist or get someone to also help.  I personally only found ways to socialize while staying in hostels and even then, it's a toss up of whom you will meet as many Japanese like to travel within their country and using hostel accomodations is very common with them.  In peak vacation times like summer or winter, you will find more international guests at hostels.  There have been times I've done several days without having a nice english-spoke conversation other than a hotel or hotel receptionist.",

Karaoke bars in Golden Gai for example. Also every single Japanese restaurant is geared for sitting down next to people, and you inevitably meet people there especially if they see you're a foreigner and they want to practice their English.\n\nJapan is just like any place anywhere on Earth; if you're not willing to put in the effort to socialize, you probably won't.",

All the social and busy hostels were already full, and the hostels I stayed at would rarely have people hanging out, or even common areas at all.\n\nMasks were (and probably are) still very mandatory and I always think that makes it harder to strike up a convo.",

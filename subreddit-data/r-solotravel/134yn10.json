    "postText": "Hello All,\n\nI am booked to fly to Mexico City from Mid June. From there I hope to travel to Colombia, Peru and Brazil, but this is flexible.\n\nWhilst I am looking forward to spending some time enjoying nature and relaxing, I was wondering if anyone had spent any time meditating or attending a sort of breathing retreat down there. It's something I've never done before but would be very open to trying. \n\nWhilst I am doing my own research, its very much the sake of I don't know what I don't know, so would appreciate any suggestions and insights. \n\nThank you.",

            "comment": "Look up Vipassana retreats! They are completely free (although you should give a donation at the end). I've tried countless styles of meditation, Ayahuasca, etc., but Vipassana is by far the most powerful and direct form of meditation. \n\nThere is no dogma or belief system associated with it. Just pure meditation that allows you to learn about reality for yourself. \n\nThere are Vipassana centers all over the world, including Latin America.",

I wish I did a meditation retreat or something similar like you're talking about, but I didn't.\n\nAs for great nature in those countries, I would highly recommend the following:\n\nColombia: Tayrona Park, Minca, Guatap\u00e9\nPeru: Ollantaytambo hike to Machu Picchu\nBrazil: Iguaz\u00fa\n\nI'm sure there are incredible spots in the Amazon forest in each of these countries but I didn't spend any time there.\n\nIf the retreat you are looking to do entails Ayahuasca, there are tons of retreats like that in Ollantaytambo, Peru.\n\nI'm sure there are tons of great nature-oriented spots in those three countries but I'm just writing here based on experience.",

I'll make a note of them and look to do some research on each of them.\n\nI've seen many discussions mention Ayahuasca. Not sure. I am not very spiritual as it as, so I think I'd like to establish such a connection in a sober fashion first before turning up the heat. \n\nThanks again",

    "postText": "Will be kicking off a trip through South Africa with 2 nights in Johannesburg. Basically looking for any suggestions for places to see, tours to take, and things to keep in mind.\n\nAs of now, my itinerary looks like this:\n\n21 May / Sunday - Land after an overnight flight in the morning, head to hotel in Rosebank, check-in. Visit Rosebank Sunday Market before heading to Apartheid Museum. Sunset view from the top of Carlton Centre (or if I'm tired, I'll push this to the next day). Dinner somewhere nice in Rosebank (it's my birthday).\n\n22 May / Monday - Take a morning tour of Soweto that shows me Orlando Towers and Vilkazi Street at the very least. In the afternoon, I'd like to hang out around an upcoming area like Maboneng.\n\n23 May / Tuesday - Check-out and head to the airport for my late morning flight out of town.\n\nMy key interest is being able to take nice photos - usually of pretty buildings, street activity, and nice views.\n\nI will be travelling solo (34 M Indian) with my camera, so any advice about photogenic places and street safety is welcome too. Thanks in advance.\n\nEDIT - On the safety advice - I've done a lot of background reading and research, and am well aware of Johannesburg\u2019s reputation for crime, especially outside working daylight hours. I\u2019ve picked what I think is a good and secure hotel, and will be using ubers/guided tours. My camera bag is lockable, and I'll keep it stowed out of view at most times. I also usually don't carry a lot of cash, preferring to use card instead, and generally dress simply - no watches or jewellery. My overall budget is mid-upper end, so I don't anticipate myself spending a lot of time on the street or in dodgy places in general. Also, I've travelled through plenty of developing countries (and I live in one myself), and while none have a reputation for crime like SA's, they're not exactly havens of peace and security either. Finally, I'm not white - which usually makes me a less attractive target for touts (thankfully) but I don't know if the same would apply for street criminals. If there's any more specific advice than this, then please let me know, but comments like 'Don't get murdered' or 'SA is very dangerous, be careful', however well intentioned, don't really help me.\n\nEDIT 2 - Just wrapped up my time in Joburg, and it turned out to be fine! I exercised caution - used Ubers, stayed in after dark, and figured some guided tours to explore rougher areas - and didn\u2019t face anything untoward. I honestly felt a bit embarrassed about having been so jumpy and scared, but I guess better safe than sorry. Also, I quite liked the city - especially how leafy it was and how exciting some neighbourhoods were!",

They can help with suggestions of things to try that you might have missed. People ask this type of question a lot so a search within that subreddit will also be helpful.",

Camps Bay along the business strip etc. The CBD has some stuff along Bree Street and there's Gardens.

Seems like you're street smart, I think you'll be just fine. Stick to ubers and/or the right stops at the Gautrain. Sounds like you got a good itinerary, I agree with the other commentor about the Carlton Tower not being spectacular tho (also not in a safe area). I'd do Constitution Hill instead. The Apartheid Museum is a must and Maboneng was great at least five-ish years ago! Good luck on your travels, I'm jealous!\n\nETA: reread your post and realised you might not have enough time for Constition Hill. Also pretty heavy stuff, as is the Apartheid Museum. But if you have the time and it doesn't feel like too much on the heavy side, it's worth a visit.",

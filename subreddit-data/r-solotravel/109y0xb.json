(32f)\nI felt someone close to me and as I turned around he walked away quickly, that\u2019s when I realized he took my phone out of my pocket. \nI was not in a pleasant mood, it was hot and I had my luggage going through the crowd. Immediately I screamed at him like a banshee and chased him around some tables before he turned around a gave it back to me. \nI\u2019m on a month long trip and that was the last thing I needed. \nWith everyone I care about still asleep at home in the states, I had to hold back my tears and the beginning of an anxiety attack and kept walking. \nSafe and in my hostel, letting it all out \ud83d\ude29",

It's good that you're taking some time to vent and process it.",

A lady came running down the Excalibur hallway to outside, chasing after a man who was holding a purse and digging in it while running. She was yelling \u201che stole my purse\u201d and I don\u2019t know why but I instantly turned around and took off running and my sisters followed behind me. He got a couple turns down towards the tram before dropping it and running off, we just waited there with it on the ground for her to catch up. It wasn\u2019t until I told my grandparents later on what had happened that they were like \u201cbut what if you put yourself in danger\u201d that I thought about that. \n\nIn the moment sometimes you just know what to do.",

I don\u2019t want to scare you off, you can walk pretty much safely just pay attention, more than what you\u2019re used to during a trip.

Thing is, my girlfriend noticed them as she\u2019s a local there, so we jumped across incoming traffic that was stopped and into a bar across the street to get away from them. They tried to grab my phone, but it was in my front pocket, so they couldn\u2019t get to it as we ran off.\n\nI got away without losing anything valuable, but it messed with me mentally for awhile, so just know that it\u2019s perfectly normal to feel distraught after being robbed. I even considered therapy because it still messed with me a month after it happened. Hope it doesn\u2019t ruin the trip for you, I still had a great time in Brazil where the good times far outweighed the bad ones and would totally do it all over again.",

I was then acknowledged that the area we went to still is one of the most trashy suburbs today. \n\nOn the other hand, I don\u2019t get that if it\u2019s the same deal with most European cities. Why Schengen visa treated travellers like they must be trashed out of the country on the dates of departure light at no time. (For example, as per your itinerary, your international flight land on 4th and depart on 10th, then your duration of stay on your visa would be 6 days, rather than a standard 1/3/6 months travel visa). I mean, it seems so unwelcoming and looking down on everyone who applied. But what\u2019s so civilised in these cities if pickpocket is the common issue?\n\nI\u2019d say most pickpocketers are resided in Schengen area to begin with, based on the reputations billions of travellers have written.

I'll spare you the long stories, but the first time was on a train, and I searched the train until I found where they ditched the bag after just taking a couple of random worthless things.  \n\nAfter that first time, it hit me pretty hard. It just shattered any illusion of safety I thought I had, and I felt completely vulnerable. For maybe a week, I was pretty paranoid and was ready to put any person that got within one arms distance of me through the wall, but I got over it. Nothing in that bag was as significant as your phone, but even then, it's just stuff, and it wasn't worth continuing to walk around like that, and let it ruin everything else for me. The second time it happened, after the initial shock, I just accepted it and let it go. That was only two incidents of almost four months of travel, and those two days didn't ruin it all for me. They just ended up being lessons learned and stories to tell, and nothing I lost really mattered in the end, or made me ever look back on my trip with regret.  \n\nI also went to Naples on that trip and loved it! It is one of the things I remember with fondness, not regret. I understand how you must feel, but leaving Naples sooner isn't going to be an escape to safety. It can happen again anywhere else you go, but most likely won't. The key thing to be mindful of was that you were conscious enough to realize it was happening, and hell, you even reacted by jumping into action, and got your phone back! Good on you! Pat yourself on the back. You weren't an oblivious victim. Just stay aware. Chances are it's not going to be a common occurrence, and if it happens again, you'll be even better prepared the next time.",

It's great that you were able to get your phone back, but it's important to take some time to process what happened and take care of yourself. It might be helpful to talk to someone about your experience and the emotions you are feeling. You can also reach out to your friends and family back home for support. It's important to be aware of your surroundings and take precautions to protect yourself, but it's also important to remember that pickpocketing can happen to anyone and it's not your fault.

It would obviously be noticed if these kids went missing. These kids have medical records in the US, so if they lost organs, there would be hard evidence documenting that fact. These kids have wealthy parents so their parents could immediately start hiring lawyers and making a stink at the US embassy, the UN, whatever it takes, if their kids came home having had their kidneys stolen.\n\nWhy on Earth would any illegal underground organ harvesting ring target international tourists who are, statistically speaking, much more likely to be among the world's wealthiest and most powerful people?\n\nThe grim reality of actual documented organ harvesting is that it targets people with no medical records, no family connections, no wealth, no ability to fight back or document what happened to them. I'm talking about political prisoners, marginalized people with no resources or money, homeless &amp; unemployed people. The people in the real world who get targeted for organ harvesting are people who could never afford a leisure trip to Naples to eat pizza and drink wine and take selfies.\n\nThe idea that little ivy league spring break Jimmy with his instagram and his selfie stick is going to go for a nice pizza dinner in Naples and get his kidney stolen is straight out of a paranoid suburbanite gossip circle. Organ harvesting targets people who don't have the resources to expose what happened to them. Jimmy's wealthy parents, who are of course paying for his Italy trip, aren't going to just shrug their shoulders when he comes home with no kidney and a huge scar lol. They're gonna make a stink and you bet it's going to make the news, because sadly, human rights atrocities get taken more seriously when they happen to well-off suburban privileged people. An organ harvesting ring targeting tourists in Europe wouldn't last long because tourists in Europe have the power and connections to expose such a thing.\n\nAnd, to humor you a bit more, if there really is some sort of vast conspiracy to harvest organs from wealthy tourists with their huge goofy cameras and ill-fitting shorts and backpacks, and it's all being covered up, how is it that the one person who apparently knows about it is your random friend who's been to Italy a few times? That would imply it's a pretty lousy cover-up. \n\nIf someone in poverty in Naples wants to make some quick money off a tourist, it's also a lot easier just to snatch that fancy camera right off them, or shove them over and grab their backpack hoping it's got a Macbook inside, rather than to create some mustache-twirling convoluted scheme to drug the person and steal their kidney. \n\nI'm sorry, but the risk of pickpocketing is real, the risk of sexual harassment is real, obviously people traveling need to know what risks they can reasonably expect to deal with. But if there was an underground conspiracy to harvest organs from wealthy tourists in Naples, I'm pretty sure Lonely Planet would include a warning about it.",

I had a similar experience in Lisbon years ago! I usually wore my travel jacket with pockets all over inside &amp; outside. I was on top of a tower overlooking this beautiful city when a young couple came up to me and asked me for some directions. I happened to have a map of the city on me (1997 f) and tried to help them. After a while they came back &amp; handed me my wallet (which could have not fallen out of my deep pocket). After they were gone, I had to assume that they stole it from me while we were looking at the map &amp; then had second thoughts (because I was so nice to them?) &amp; returned it! True story, but very unusual!",

We had a few days before we headed out to Sicily for a wedding. \n\nFor the most part we walked to where we wanted to visit. We were staying in the Centro Storico area and one of the days we decided to take the metro up to the National Archeological Museum. We would have just walked but after a 2 week walking tour of Rome and the Amalfi Coast and a couple of days walking around Naples we thought \u201cWhat the heck let\u2019s take the metro even if it just saves 15 minutes\u201d. \n\nI had my wallet and passport in my front zippered pocket of my cargo pants (yes very American). Standing room only in the subway car. I felt something grab and pull at my pocket. I grabbed a hand on pant and it pulled away. When I turned around I saw a short small man who looked like he was about to crap his pants. I gave him a look that said \u201cI\u2019m going to rip your head off\u201d. I gave him a look because I didn\u2019t know how to say that in Italian. \n\nHe immediately started backing up. The train reached the destination and I exited with my wallet and passport. Said pickpocket disappeared into the crowd.",

I\u2019m Chinese so there may be a possibility I\u2019m going to be targeted. I wear no jewelry and wear the cheapest Fitbit model currently on sale. I plan to carry my bag in front but I do have a camera bag with camera and lenses. I\u2019ve lost my phone once but it was out of folly when I dropped it in the cab of an dishonest driver in Santorini. I\u2019ve stopped a group of young girls trying to steal from my husband in Paris when they distracted him with \u201csurvey\u201d. Basically yelled at them like a crazy woman and told them to get lost. I figured that if anyone were to come close and try to talk to me I\u2019d act all crazy and they would leave me alone\u2026..? Gosh I\u2019m super nervous about the train station when I arrive with my bags and all. Any tips will be helpful",

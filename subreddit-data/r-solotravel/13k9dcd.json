    "postText": "I'm debating a trip to Munich wherein I'd stay for 6 nights, I'd have 3 days exploring the city, and 3 days where I do some trips around Bavaria, got it all worked out but I'm wondering if my day trips are feasible given the time I've given myself, I am looking at;\n\nGarmisch-Partenkirchen - This one is pretty easy as its only around an hour from Munich and I'd have plenty of time to explore and whatnot, not too worried about this one\n\nBerchtesgaden - Not too sure on how feasible a day trip is, as its 2 hours out of the city + it looks pretty open and I feel like i'd be in a rush to get a proper fill of the area\n\nRothenburg ob der Tauber - Sort of the same issue as above, quite far out on the train, I'd have around 4 hours there before I'd have to head back, not sure if its worth the trek\n\nIf anyone has been to any of the places I've listed, particularly the last two, I'd be keen to hear if you think a day trip is feasible, or perhaps I should pick one and turn it in to a two day trip perhaps?\n\nThanks for reading",

            "comment": "I've been to all of these places. When going to Garmisch, make sure to visit the Zugspitze too.\n\nFor Berchtesgaden, it depends on what you're planning to do. There's not much in the town, but if you want to visit Obersalzberg and take a stroll around the K\u00f6nigssee, you can easily spend a whole day there.\n\nRothenburg is such a beautiful old town, I'd say it's always worth a visit even if there's not much time. Your four hours there should be enough tho to explore the old town center.\nThe Taubertal (where Rothenburg is located) is a vastly different landscape than what you'll see around Garmisch, might be interesting too.\nIf you don't know if you'll ever visit Bavaria again, I'd say just go for it. \n\nAll that being said, taking trains in Bavaria late in the evening/night is save and Munich is a save city too (just use your common sense) so I wouldn't worry too much about arriving late back in Munich after one of your trips.",

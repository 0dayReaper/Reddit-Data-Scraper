Do I want a quiet island with plenty of old churches and monasteries? Do I want an island with charming villages? Or do I want to go to Santorini to see the unique landscape? Gotta make time for Athens, Athens is a must. But I also want to go to Crete. But I also want to go to the Peloponnese. But I also want to go to the north of the country. AHHHHHHH.",

Paradise beach club was okay. Disgusting rooms. If you came to party and get shitfaced you came to the right place. Otherwise it\u2019s just kind of mid. Still, great scenery, if you\u2019re into that. \n\nSantorini - slightly less arid interior (some vineyards and such) and incredible verticality. In a word: breathtaking. The views are seriously second to none. Rent an ATV and ride from Fira to Oia and watch the sunset, ride to one of the colored sand beaches, or to ancient Fira, or take a catamaran tour of the caldera. \n\nCorfu - this place felt special. One of the most beautiful places on the planet \u2014 pure paradise. There are some historical sites here (Achilleion palace, built for Empress Sisi of Austria, is fully closed for restoration sadly/fortunately) but the beauty of the coasts is what really struck me. Go to Paleokastritsa and go cliff jumping, kayaking in Agios Gordios, or rent a boat and go sea cave exploring. \n\nYou really can\u2019t go wrong no matter where you choose. And as another commenter said, you can go to Greece more than once! Next time I want to hit Naxos, Paros, Crete, and Meteora.",

I was kind of in the same head space as you are now, trying to make the most of my time and money for the trip, not wanting to make the \"wrong\" choice in case I can't make a return trip anytime soon. The couple told me: do Athens for a day (two days max unless you want a lot of busy city action), Santorini if you're going during the off season because there'll be a lot less people, one of the other islands if you're going during peak season. When I tried to press them about which island was best the husband said, \"They're all beautiful. You can't pick wrong. Just go. Just go!\" Also remember that ferry rides between the islands exist. If you visit Santorini and it's within your budget, consider renting a car. The island is so much more than just the instagram-worthy tourist hot spot. I can also recommend staying at The Remezzo Suites because the daily included breakfast is next level and the family that runs the villas are super nice. Regardless of what you finally decide on you're going to have so much fun!!",

Is it summer, or is it fall? \n\nWhen I went, I settled on 3 -Naxos, Santorini, and Rhodes. Naxos was lovely in late September. Still warm and few tourists. Santorini was overcrowded -never again, but absolutely 100% worth going once. And Rhodes was the favorite -Rhodes has everything -history, beaches, whitewashed Greek Isles architecture, you name it. Crete required too much time to do on one trip. \n\nAnd don't forget the mainland. Places like Meteora and Monemvasia are out of this world. Athens is a must see for the Acropolis and the museum, but really in some ways I found it the least \"wow\" part of the trip.",

If you really wanted to do Athens in 2 to 3 days, it\u2019s fairly easy to do. The one recommendation I have is to check the cruise schedule\u2026 On days cruises are docked, the cities swells unbelievably with tourist, and it makes some of the tourist spots way more crowded than normal. If you are there on days a cruise is docked, just plan your day accordingly. Just know by mid morning to mid afternoon, all the major tourist attractions are jampacked so sometimes it\u2019s better to go earlier in the morning or as dusk settles.",

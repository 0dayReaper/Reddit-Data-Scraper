    "postText": "I always try to find a bookstore that sells english books whenever I arrive somewhere new. I then make sure that I read the book whilst in the country. Whenever someone talks about the book, I see the book in my bookshelves or I get to think about a special passage in that book I somehow also remembers how I felt in that country and it just brings back so many good memories.\n\nWhat do you guys do to remember past travel experiences?",

I didn't plan to buy anything, but I found a book called \"The Blue-Eyed Salaryman\" by Niall Murtagh, which told his story as an Irish guy who moved to Japan and got a job at a Mitsubishi factory. \n\nIt seemed cool, but the price was in Yen and I didn't know the exchange rate (this was pre-cell phone days) so I just charged it on my credit card and went on my way. \n\nI read the book on my travels and really enjoyed it, but when I got home and got my credit card bill in the mail, I realized that book had cost me $36!!! A lot of money for me at the time!\n\nTwenty years later that book still sits on my shelf and I'm glad I bought it, if only for the memories of that epic Asian backpacking trip when I was a poor college kid.",

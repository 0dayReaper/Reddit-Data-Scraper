    "postText": "I'm about to go to Barcelona in a few days and was just casually browsing Airbnb experiences (as well as tripadvisor, Viator, etc) for things to do. \n\nI noticed there were a bunch of highly reviewed photographers plying their trade. Tbh most of the photos and reviews seemed like it was coming from women, couples, families or groups of friends (mostly all women). \n\nI'm a single dude that's been pretty desperate for good photos of myself. I'll be honest, it's a 100% for dating apps. I need every tiny advantage. I have too many selfies. I solo travel so I can't ask a friend to take photos. I've tried asking random people, but those photos turn out to be trash because they either don't know how to use an Android so the photo is out of focus or they don't know how to accommodate for my skin color (I'm a dark skinned Indian dude) so you either can't see me or it's completely washed out. I'm still saddened by not having a single photo of me in the Hobbiton set in NZ despite it being nearly 5 years ago lol. The poor guide tried a lot but she just couldn't get it to where you can actually see me. \n\nAnyway, I'm wondering if these photography experiences would be a good way to accomplish this? Has anyone tried this before? I'm worried they'd look at me weird or I'd look like a prat out in Barcelona lol.",

The photographer was so friendly and we chatted the whole time, it was just the two of us and honestly just felt like hanging out with a friend who also happened to be taking a lot of pictures haha. I'm really not photogenic and hate getting my photo taken but I'm glad that now I have at least a few photos that aren't selfies that I'm happy with. And yes you might look a little silly and locals might judge you but you probably will only stay a few minutes in each location. \n\nI would definitely pay attention to reviews because the personality of the photographer and whether you vibe will also be pretty important, especially to make sure you look relaxed in the photos.",

The photographer didn't say anything specifically about clothes, but I'm sure you could ask in advance if they had any tips - for example, I know that wearing white or very light colours is sometimes discouraged for photos, I'm assuming for reasons related to lighting. The only time we talked about clothes was partway through, I asked if my shirt looked better tucked in or not. \n\nI would recommend bringing whatever you picture yourself wearing for it from home, and potentially looking for other options while you're there, but not necessarily counting on buying something while on the trip. In my experience whenever I go in with the intention to buy something, I never find anything good!",

I wasn't too impressed with mine in Paris, but I have absolutely phenomenal pictures from turkey. So pay attention to the reviews.\n\nSkin color doesn't matter that much during daytime. If it's a sunny day, white can actually be your friend because the contrast would be nice. The trick to good photos (of course, the photographer's skill comes first) is knowing how to pose. Google a bit, and see which angles you like on your mirror and practice natural smiling. White shirt and blue jeans is a very standard outfit. Plan your outfit before. The outfit issue actually ruined my Paris pictures, I didn't take proper shoes with me, so I had to improvise with the dress (I'm a girl, if that wasn't clear). Take sunglasses, it elevates some pictures. \n\nDon't hesitate to ask to do retakes. Another mistake I made in Paris, didn't ask to see the pictures after he took it. I could have used a few more takes.\n\nSorry about the info dump. I'm just excited - I love having good pictures from my trips. Hope you get some too.",

I wanted to do this because I didn\u2019t really have any nice professional photos of myself, plus as a solo traveler I had the same predicament of not always having someone to take my photo. It was a fairly good experience and I got some photos in places that I wouldn\u2019t have ventured to myself, like small side streets with lanterns in front of izakayas. To be honest the photos didn\u2019t turn out as well as I\u2019d hoped; I don\u2019t think it was the photographer\u2019s fault though. The scenery is great but (TMI) randomly my bra became unhooked in the middle of the session, and for some reason I was too shy to ask him for a bathroom break where I could quickly re-fasten it, so in half the photos I look kind of awkward and hunched over trying to keep everything in place. So I haven\u2019t actually used the photos for anything publicly, but I just have them as part of my keepsakes from this trip. With that said, I would totally try this again someplace else.",

Did you hike the Inka trail or take the train?\" etc.\n\nHowever, make sure you include photos with your friends.  According to my female friends, they like seeing photos that show your social circle/friend types.  It makes you less creepy with just solo shots.\n\nLastly, try to take photos in your natural daily lifestyle, so don't post pictures of you at some fancy luxury hotel pool or in some fancy restaurant unless your lifestyle actually dictates that.  You'll just come off as douchey.",

For the first, booking a photo session would be the way to go.  For the second, a photo workshop.  But you'd probably at least get a few good photos because if it's a group interested in photos, you're more likely to get a better photo. I personally like the workshops because I learn some new skills and get some good landscape or cityline photos.  \n\n\nDon't worry about looking silly, from a distance, it'll look like a friend taking photos of another friend.  People with experience in portrait photography will know what poses are flattering and how to get good light.    \n\n\nIf the setting or backdrop isn't that important, do you have any friends who like photography or are interested in learning more?

I\u2019m totally using this idea.\n\nAlso as a photographer myself, i can give you some advice that might help with the lighting issues in your pics. In general, you want the subject (you) to be facing the direction of light. Where is that? Hold your palm up in front of your face. Now rotate it around. See where your palm is lit up the brightest; that\u2019s the angle you need to face.\n\nYou do not want to have your back to this light source; you will be dark and your background super bright and washed out. There *are* ways around this, i.e. you want a pic with the sunset behind you; you can use flash or a reflector to light up the subject. But that requires more effort, and specialized equipment.\n\nAlso in general, direct mid-day sunlight makes for bad pictures. Golden hour sunlight, or cloudy light is best. At least get in some shade.\n\nEdit: you can also use photo editing software like lightroom to bring down the brightness of your background, and increase your brightness. A quality photographer should be doing that for you already. But if you have any old pics you wanna salvage, it\u2019s worth the effort.",

If you want candid shots of you drinking coffee or buying something or even just crossing the street, communicate that. \n\nThe people you'll encounter are used to tourists getting their pictures taken, especially at more popular destinations.

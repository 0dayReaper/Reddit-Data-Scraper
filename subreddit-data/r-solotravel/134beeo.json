    "postText": "Hey all! So I\u2019m starting to plan my first solo trip for this Fall and I can\u2019t wait!! I\u2019ll be  heading to Europe for 2 months, maybe a bit more, for some backpacking/inter-railing/whatnot. However, the wall I keep hitting in my planning is having to pick just a handful of places to go\u2026 There\u2019s so much I want to see and do and I would go literally everywhere if I could, but I also don\u2019t want to send myself on an insane, exhausting, marathon of a trip (thinking I\u2019ll do ~16 cities for ~60 days?).\n\nSo, I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any tips for how to narrow down a never ending \u201cwant to go\u201d list? How do you guys pick?",

            "comment": "i don't have any specific tips for picking locations buut one idea is to;\n1. check where it's easier to fly in &amp; out of (if you're not from europe)\n2. use a map and mark every place you're interested in\n3. choose a direction to go in (e.g. north/south/east) &amp; if you need/want to start and end your trip in the same destination\n4. if you e.g. fly into amsterdam and decide to go south, you can then do more research on that route to find other spots you may like\n\ngeneral tip is to use seat61.com for accessing info on different train routes so you can see if your plan with stops etc. makes sense logistically",

If you are going for the months of Oct+Nov, that is really 2 different seasons in Italy - it may hit 70-75F/~22C in Rome in the first couple weeks of October, but it might be low 60s day time highs a month later.  \n\nSo, if those are the 2 months you are going, and you are going to places like London or Amsterdam, it may make sense to start your trip up there, and work south, so you only have to pack for fall weather.",

Unless there is an aspect you want to focus on like a particular cuisine, Renaissance history, extreme sports, fashion etc. then you'll find engaging sights and experiences in every country. You could plan a route taking in every capital and a second city in the country, and I'm pretty sure you'd not regret those choices when there. \n\nI think Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova are not advisable for obvious reasons, but could be wrong.",

They will show you what you can see/do, have an events calendar, and often have sample itineraries, day trips and tours.  That helps me decide how long to stay in a place.  On at least two occasions,I have found so many interesting things during the research pause of my planning that I switched my plan to give more time in a place.\n\nAlso (if this does apply), keep in mind that this is your first trip, not your only one.  As another poster suggested, a map is a key tool.  A logical progression will be much better than flitting all over the place.",

YouTube is a huge help....I watch the walking tour videos and top things to do.\n\nI'm not into WWII history or clubbing so I might skip Berlin. From what I have gathered, it's like the New York city of Germany and it has polarizing opinions of it being awesome (great parks/lakes/hiking/berlin wall/etc) and not worth it(drug needles everywhere/dirty/aggressive homeless/stay away from parks at night/etc).\n\nI wanted to go to Brussels, which can be done in one day, but then discovered Ghent through reddit....so I took Brussels off the list because from the videos I saw, I'd have a better time in Ghent. \n\nOnce I get to prague, I'm leaving it open and not going to pre-book anything because I want the freedom and flexibility.\n\nEverything is cheaper in eastern europe compared to western Europe so paying a premium for last minute bookings will not be a problem. Also, shoulder season starts in Sept so transpo/accommodation prices go down everywhere.\n\nI'm still creating a spreadsheet of what I'd like to see in each city in the savvybackpacker itinerary so when I decided to move to the next city, I'll already know what I'd like to do.\n\nI've made it a point to not turn this trip into a checkbox and prebooking the entire trip turns it into one. If I do not complete the itinerary in terms of cities, oh well...not a big deal.\n\ni've been reading other ppl's 90 day backpacking trip in europe and they wish they didn't pre-book the entire trip. It was that they wanted to stay longer in one area and/or they met ppl who invited them to go somewhere but couldn't because of a booking or they burned out before the end. \n\nSpontaneity is a hell of a drug and to get it, you can't have too strict of a schedule.\n\nEurope should still be around for at least another 50 years to go back anyway to continue where I left off.\n\nEDIT*: I chose to go clockwise because the temperatures are cooler in the north during the summer time. For fall season.....maybe starting up north then working south would still be better to avoid snow/ice. *shrug*",

I'd focus on the big ones YOU HAVE to see and save a portion for your next trip. Do eastern/western Europe and start planning your next trip. Also just be flexible to changes. You may plan 2 days at one city and find you love it. Stay longer or come back after the next city. My personal recommendation is having a must see list and some others you would be okay without if you find something more interesting as you go along. I've found solo traveling an introspective journey and you'll change as you go along. Be open to the change and the experience. You can't go wrong really so just enjoy it!",

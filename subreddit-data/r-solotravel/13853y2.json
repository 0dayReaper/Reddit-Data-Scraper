            "comment": "Yep, perfectly reasonable.\n\nBut do make sure to drop-off the rental car outside of Paris - either at the airport or some suburb that has a drop-off point near the train station. You don't want to drive in Paris if you can avoid it.",

                    "comment": "I second this. It is best to navigate in paris by train. If you can, drop your luggages at you hotel if it's near the airport and if you hotel is in Paris, you could maybe rent a luggage lockers at the airport for the remaining day when you drop off the rented car and only bring with you what you'll need for you last day in Paris in the smallest bag you have, that way you won't have to commute to the center of Paris with all your things.   \n   \nIf you cannot or do not want to use a luggage locker and want to keep all your stuff with you in Paris for your last night/day, there used to be a shuttle to paris downtown but I think it has closed unfortunately so ypur only options are the train RER B (12euro, less confortable, keep your luggage close at all time) or the taxi (60euros+ more confortable but a rip off and given traffic it can cost you even more). Keep in mind too there are atrikes all over the place currently and the trains will be the first affected, so be prepared :). \n\nAll of yhia to say that either the train or the taxi is probably better than driving yourself to enter Paris.   \n   \nOyherwise yoyr itinary is nice and reasonnable. If you have some tume on the road ypu coyld also do some quick stop here and there, near Amboise, the city of Tours is really cute, and on the road from Bordeaux to Ambroise, the city of Poitiers is nice too, it has and old city with small steet, troglodyte cliff and stuff, you coyld go get lunch there before heading to Amboise :). \n   \nHave fun.",

Penang is literally one of my favorite places in the world.\n\nSeriously. the food, the people, the vibe, the fusion of culture. I have so many good memories. It is so close to Langkawi as well.\n\nIt is a damn shame you only have 8 days for this, you will not even scratch the surface of Malaysia. If you insist on such a rushed trip I would recommend this.\n\nDay 1-3 Langkawi\n\nDay 4-6 Penang\n\nDay 7-8 KL (Seriously, as a tourist, KL is quite underwhelming. 2 days is good)",

Not to forget the abundance of street food, just google and research to find which cuisines suit your interest. While you're there get up the Penang Hill by cable car and enjoy the view of the island on the hill. \n\nIn KL i would forgo Genting Highlands unless you're a fam of themeparks and gambling. If you're a nature person, Cameron Highlands might be better with a trip to the Boh tea plantation, there's also some hike trails available that is quite pleasant with the colder weather. Also while you're in KL,  Batu Caves shouldn't be missed as its only a 30 mins drive or train trip away.",

Don't miss the Pinang Peranakan Mansion. \n\nAlso, you might consider heading from langkawi to Koh Lipe in Thailand- it's an easy ferry ride and much more interesting than Langkawi, imo, which is somewhat manufactured fun.",

If you like street food, clashes (in a good way) of Malay, Chinese, Indian, and Thai, cultures, and an easy walking city, Penang is a must. \n\nKL is pretty awesome. Lonely Planet Guides are super helpful there. \n\nThe city has efficient, inexpensive, safe, clean, modern, easy to navigate (Google maps friendly!) train systems you can take to, or very near, all the main tourist sites. For example, KL Tower (good for photography), Batu Caves (the caves suck imho, but the surrounding Temple and visitors are colorful), and some of the best street food on the planet... especially after sunset.  Also check out Petalang Street markets (and wander into the nearby Red Light district before dark while holding onto your wallet. It's an entertaining show. LOL!) \n\nSign up for Grab (the Lyft of SE Asia) and inexpensive cars can take you to cool places. Plus, English is common and many Grab drivers are excited to provide reliable 'must see' and 'must eat' pointers. \n\nMalaysia is a fantastic destination. Have a great trip!",

But it was the only part of KL where I thought it wise to tuck my 35mm camera into a shoulder bag (I'm an avid urban Street Photographer) before threading the small knots of hardened looking characters. Otherwise, KL felt remarkably safe for a giant metropolis. \n\nIf you avoid obvious tourist traps, like going into bars that dot the small neighborhood and ignore anyone trying to sell you something, it shouldn't be problematic to explore the area.",

If you're staying there you are fine, but you would be contributing to the problem by supporting them. Gecko House was an amazing experience for me. Also, waste of money on the cable car and sky bridge experience. I second the notion of not skipping Penang. Langkawi got boring for me after 4 days, so your amount of time there is good.",

            "comment": "Tickets / activities can be booked on the spot as well as in advance (online), it won't really make much of a difference. I'd just book online once I'm there to make sure they're open and also to give me the flexibility to change plans at the last minute (a lot of the sights you've listed are a bit too touristy and maybe you won't feel like doing all of them once you've got a sense of the place). \n\nCameron Highlands is quite nice if you're Malaysian or Singaporean or generally like the idea of being in a cool weather place with quirky history. As far as landscapes go, though, you'll find much more impressive ones elsewhere in Asia with less effort and cost. \n\nOn your itinerary, I'd say you're spending a little too much time in Kuala Lumpur. Its not a bad place but it honestly doesn't have a terrible amount to see and do. I'd give one day to the downtown (the historic quarter around Merdeka Square is cool, and the modern malls around Petronas / Bukit Bintang are where the nightlife shines), and another to do leftovers like Batu Caves. I'd instead give time to George Town in Penang which is lovely - lots of old buildings, excellent streetfood, and access to a pleasant coast as well as some hills. Langkawi's best beaches are on the northern side of the island, so if you can figure a day pass to places like The Datai, The Andaman, or The Datai golf course, give them a shot - the area is amazingly beautiful.",

Sandakan Backpackers hostel took care of the whole set up for river cruise and jungle trekking and the bus to get there, stayed at a hostel in the middle of the jungle, got to see wild orangutans it was incredible to see them in nature.

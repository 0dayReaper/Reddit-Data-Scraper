    "postText": "Hey everyone- first time traveling to somewhere with different voltage since covid and now I\u2019m over thinking everything.\n\nI am traveling from US- Ghana. I have plenty of adaptors for the plug and power banks which I\u2019m pretty sure are dual voltage. \n\nI bought a small fan that is not dual voltage (made to work in the US). Can I charge my power bank there and use that to charge the fan which has a USB C port? \n\nThanks- sorry for such a basic question",

            "comment": "If you can charge your fan at home with your battery, you'll be able to charge your fan in Ghana with your battery. It's the same power source, doesn't matter where the charge came from.\n\nThe only thing you need to worry about there is to make sure that whatever charger you use for your battery accepts the voltage from Ghana outlets.\n\nDon't be \"pretty sure\" your chargers are dual voltage though. Nearly every charger will list on the brick what voltage it can accept (not sure, it may even be legally required). It will usually say something like \"Input: 100-240V\" and you can probably just google it if not. Don't risk frying one of your chargers or devices when you can fairly quickly confirm whether they will work. Standards are 120V for USA and 230V for Ghana, if you haven't already looked that up.",

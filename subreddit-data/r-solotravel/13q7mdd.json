    "postText": "Hello! I'm (25F) gonna be travelling alone to Berlin, Prague, and Vienna in late August (20-30). My flight is round trip from Berlin Brandenburg so I will definitely need to be in Berlin at the beginning and end of my journey.  However, I'm struggling with how to split up the days. I'm very interested in history, art, architecture (I study architecture) and like to anchor my days with 1-2 big ticketed/planned activites (museums, tour, etc.) and then spend the time between exploring by foot, eating, sightseeing, etc. \n\nSo far I'm thinking 4 days in Berlin split up into 2s to bookend the trip, 3 days in Prague, 3 days in Vienna. Is this too rushed? Should i cut the trip to Cesky Krumlov? \n\nAug 20 - Berlin - I land in the morning, drop off luggage, some light exploration and I have a walking tour planned for the afternoon\n\nAug 21 - Berlin \n\nAug 22 - Prague - Take an early morning train from Berlin to Prague\n\nAug 23 - Prague\n\nAug 24 - Prague... day trip to Cesky Krumlov??\n\nAug 25 - Vienna - Take an early morning train to Vienna from Prague\n\nAug 26 - Vienna\n\nAug 27 - Vienna - Take overnight sleeper train to Berlin\n\nAug 28 - Berlin\n\nAug 29 - Berlin\n\nAug 30 - Leave Berlin in the afternoon\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice/experience is appreciated!",

            "comment": "Berlin is much more for museums than architecture because most of the places have been recently rebuilt. Tons of WW2 history to see there but personally think 4 days is a bit much for Berlin for a tourist, even though the city is huge itself, the tourist sites are fairly close to eachother. There starts to be a lot of overalp between the musuems and sites. Recommend to take a free walking tour\n\nHonestly Prague was much smaller than I thought if you want to stick to main areas, gorgeous though. The day trip to Cesky Krumlov can be a last minute thing if you decide you've seen enough of Prague. Cesky is a very cute, quaint, and small town, you can walk around it in a few hours. It was quite dead when I was there Oct 2021, but great place for the typical Europe town photo\n\nVienna is amazing! Especially for architecture, seriously the whole city is filled with gorgeous buildings. Loved Belvedere Palace. Best food was Berliner D\u00f6ner Wien food truck holy shit I dream of the lamb doner. Honestly (if you have time) I would spend another day in Vienna to really soak it in if you have time.\n\nA place I would add (if you have time) between Berlin and Prague is Dresden, amazing baroque architecture with much historical significance as a place that got heavily bombed during WW2. Zwinger was so peaceful. You can do it in a day quickly.\n\nLmk if there's anything else I can help with!",

    "postText": "I'm not in any means trying to make this story sounds cliche in any shape of form, but I'm trying to share a story that can maybe enlighten those who are in rock in a hard alike to me in 2021.  In 2021, I was a Sophomore in Highschool with uncontrollable ADHD. Despite my ADHD, throughout Highschool I pushed myself to do well in my studies.   \n\n\nUnfortunately, when I had returned back to Highschool after a grueling two years in lockdown, alike to many other teens, I had found myself in a depressive state. I had done well Freshman year while online because of the personalized learning, so I had decided to push myself and take harder classes than I did the year before, but when I had reached the open playground of IRL Highschool, I was just not ready for the new workload.  Once the year started, I was pulling all nighters every week, got poor sleep, didn't take care of my hygiene (there were times where I wouldn't take showers for weeks), and never ate/had a terrible diet when I did eat.   \n\n\nObviously, these bad habits would eventually lead to my downfall. I spent weeks on end where the only thing I could think of was killing myself and how I would do it. In around March, I had attempted my first suicide attempt. After this event, I had gone to the hospital and was given various evaluations.    \nAfter my visit at the hospital, I was to remove myself from school and just rest at home for a couple weeks. While my actual school wasn't really an option for me, my parents had still wanted me to receive an education. My parents had found an independent study program for me and I had started with that. During my time in the independent study program, I came across a YouTuber named Drew Binsky. The video I had specifically watched was about him travelling to Iran. My parents are from Iran, so honestly at the time, I just wanted to see a foreigner visit Iran, but what I saw in this video really changed things for me. I was able to see the beauty in travelling the world, meeting people while doing so, and trying delicious food from all over. After this video, I had watched every single one of Drew Binsky's videos.   \n\n\nAfter a couple of months, summer had approached. During summer I was catching up on school that I had missed during the year and had a job in addition. I had made it my goal that summer to use the money I had made from working at McDonald's to eventually go on a solo trip for myself. Since I was about 16 at the time, solo travelling as a teen was a bit iffy. But after a lot of research and a lot of fights between me and my parents, I was eventually able to go with a language immersion program called EF. This EF program was in Rome. I had travelled to Europe with my family before going to Rome, but I had never gone to Rome, so I definitely knew I was in for a treat.   \n\n\n(I could babble on and on about how Rome was and how it changed sh\\*t for me, but ye i'm not lol)  \n\n\nTravel has been a transformative experience that truly cured my depression. It provided me with a profound sense of healing and renewal. Through my journeys, I was able to escape the suffocating grasp of depression and discover a new zest for life. Every step I took in a foreign land, every breathtaking vista I encountered, and every interaction with diverse cultures acted as a powerful antidote to the darkness that once consumed me. In the end, travel became the catalyst for my healing, a powerful force that rescued me from the depths of depression. It opened my eyes to the beauty of the world and reminded me of my own resilience. It is through the adventures and discoveries I made along the way that I emerged stronger, happier, and more fulfilled than ever before.  \n\n\n\\*PS. to the readers: I'm sorry some of this stuff is a bit dry. I'm really bad at talking about my feelings and past events in general.",

            "comment": "As someone who suffers from depression as well, I can certainly relate to the welcome breath of fresh air which could be really uplifting which traveling brings. That said, it's very much a short spell of respite which would gradually make its way back into your life once you return home (stress triggers, environment factors, emotional traumas etc). Based on my personal experience, it very much boils down to a shift in mindset and perspective, and really turning the tables on negative voices/ thoughts. You could probably consider giving the book Feeling Good by David Burns a read. This has been recommended by quite a few of my therapists :)",

A great experience can do wonders, can make you feel like your old self. Just know that after time, you might feel depressed again. I hope you don\u2019t! But I\u2019d rather you understand it\u2019s possible. Otherwise, you might get blindsided by it and feel overwhelmed. Consider taking to a therapist even though you don\u2019t currently feel depressed.",

Only therapy has helped manage my mental health in the longer term, but travel did help build my self-esteem and challenge some of the more negative voices in my head. \n\nIt\u2019s really important to realise that travel may (or may not) be a catalyst to better mental health management, but that good professional help is what will help to work through and maintain any changes.",

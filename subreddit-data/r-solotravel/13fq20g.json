While the host's place wasn't even an accurate description with a broken heater &amp; home situated on an uneven /steep hill, I let it slide and now She's jeopardizing my airbnb account by these accusations. 5 days after i checked out no less!!\n\nAirbnb was in Heidelberg, Germany rented out by a British couple. Listing -&gt;https://air.tl/2ANc0q8d\n\nDuring the investigation Airbnb restricted my account activity as below which made me jump from my seat on my IC train to the next airbnb:\n\n\"As of now, your account access has been limited while we finish our review. While your account access is limited, you won\u2019t be able to book new reservations. We may also have to cancel upcoming reservations as a precaution. \n\nYou can review our Community Standards at: airbnb.com/help/article/3328\n\nI'm hoping to confirm the following:\n\n- Were you, or anyone in your party, involved in any drug-related incident in any of your recent reservations?\n- Do you remember any drug or drug paraphernalia being left in the listing?\n- Have you left anything in a listing that might have been perceived as drugs or paraphernalia?\"\n\nI contacted airbnb to open a counter case for these false accusations and they said I can't because it's been \"resolved\".  like what? I don't even know what the final decision is.\n\n\"The case has been reviewed by the management and they confirmed that the proper measures had been taken.\n\nPer our Terms of Service, Airbnb reserves the right to make the final determination with regard to these disputes. Please know, we are unable to reconsider the decision made in this case.\n\nFor full transparency, we want you to know that we\u2019ve made a note of this on your account. This is only for our internal representatives to see.\n\nIf we receive a similar report in the future and find that you haven\u2019t followed our Community Standards, we may remove your account from the Airbnb platform. Please take some time to review our Community Standards:\u00a0airbnb.com/help/article/3328\nBest regards,\nAlele\"\n\nAnd after I asked them to pay for my blood test so that I can prove I'm clean, they wrote:\n\n\"We\u2019ve taken the time to carefully review your account and the documentation provided.\n\nOur Safety Team has concluded that the original outcome should be upheld at this time.\n\nAs further communication will not change the outcome of this case, we must respectfully disengage from further discussion.\"\n\nAnyone ever falsely accused by their airbnb host and can advise how you dealt with it when Airbnb took the side of the hosts and puts all blame and their version of criminal record on your account ?\n\nAnd most importantly, why do hosts do this?\nWhat do they have to gain from this?",

This wasn\u2019t written anywhere in the listing or in-app instructions, but was printed on a small sign in the kitchen. We didn\u2019t notice the sign until it was checkout time, and at that point it created a huge inconvenience as we were headed to the airport in a small rental car, and didn\u2019t have room in the car for all four adults, our luggage, and 2 big bags of trash. Also, the dump was in the opposite direction from the airport, so it added 30 total minutes to our drive. My friends wound up sitting with smelly trash bags on their laps on the way out of town, and we had to skip breakfast so as not to miss our flight.\n\nI always leave vacation rentals clean and in good shape but this was too much to ask. What was that $280 cleaning fee for, exactly?",

Sometimes I just get crazy good deals on airbnb (like I'm staying just outside Berlin right on a trainline that goes right downtown in 20 minutes for only 750 euro for a month in october/november. I'd NEVER get close to that at a hotel.)  \n\n\nEdited to add: And it has two beds, a living room, a full kitchen and laundry (which can get really pricey in Europe at laundrymats.)",

The views were really nice, but to sit that long, no thanks. The city was clean, easy to get around and the people were friendly especially when one tried using Spanish. I was there about 5 days for Day of the Dead. Definitely different than what's done in Mexico City. Next time I want to try doing stuff outside of the city and do some nature stuff. Just need to do some research.",

I\u2019ve since learned about their economic and social consequences and am switching back to hotels/other alternatives to ease my conscience. If you\u2019re interested, there\u2019s [great research](https://www.cesifo.org/en/publications/2021/working-paper/airbnb-and-rental-markets-evidence-berlin) about how AirBnb distorts rental markets in Berlin. \n\nIt\u2019s a known effect that is affecting holiday towns in my home country too (NZ).

My weather app said it was 80F outside and when I stepped into the building, it had to be 10 degrees hotter.  When I went to the top floor where the host's apartment was, it was way hotter than the lobby.  And there was no A/C.  It was so hot I couldn't stand to have clothes on, much less a sheet over me.  I was so miserable I couldn't sleep, so I left at about 2am.  It was way, way cooler outside.  The host claimed that it was so cold in the apartment that they had to sleep with quilts and that I was just a bad person.\n\nThe host had some pretty strict cleaning rules.  It was obvious to me that they used guests as maids.  The apartment was neat, but dirty, especially the bathroom.  The kitchen looked OK until she opened the frig.  Yuck.  \n\nI've never used airbnb since.",

Until the pandemic, AirBnb was a very popular and liked business that offered budget stays at other people's places. Then scumbag hosts found ways to parasite off the real estate market and all of a sudden charge as much as a 5-star hotel.\n\nThe only time I will still use an AirBnb is if I cannot find any decent hotel for under $150 a night in large US cities like NYC, Chicago, LA, SF, Miami. Even then, I read the reviews carefully and do research on the location. I will also notify the host if I'm coming and leaving at a bad time. Unfortunately hotels in the summer can be very expensive so sometimes I use an AirBnb if I want to stay in the city center.",

This was in the hight of COVID and we were only there because of being between houses during a move. I reported it to AirBnB and they did nothing about it. I was offered a refund but at that point it would have been twice as much to rent anything comparable so last minute. They weren\u2019t willing to help at all. Something new to customer service with them for me. I\u2019ve had them cover the difference in a past situation where the room was not what was pictured so I was shocked at the treatment. \n\nI was stuck dealing with this unreasonable women for another month and a half. She showed up and kept driving and walking by trying to see in. Reported every time and nothing from AirBnB. COPs were happy to tell her to leave though. \n\nIn the end I was accused of steeling her vacuum. She saw me packing mine when she was watching us pack up so the vaccine bug bit her fat ass. So that\u2019s what\u2019s on my last host review. That and that I was suspicious and rude. I was told neither her nor I would be able to leave a review so when prompted I skipped it. Lesson learned. \n\n\nAirBnB has always been weird though. I once out of habit from home switched on both the light and fan in the bathroom in the middle of the night. I was told because it was broken it made crazy noise upstairs. They wrote that I made crazy noise in the middle of the night in the bathroom. They made it sound like I got back late drunk and acting a fool instead of their shit being broken. Ugh I concert and do get back late regularly. I\u2019m always super quiet and respectful. I\u2019m always upfront about the late arrivals with hosts and now with this I\u2019m afraid more are going to turn down my bookings. \n\nHotels and car camping have been my go tos since. Price wise it\u2019s just made more sense but I haven\u2019t ruled out AirBnB.",

Called the host when we arrived, she was like \"can't help you, the key is at the reception, the reception is closed, bye\".

I had this exact same line from them when my 4 star review of a place got removed because I mentioned that it was in a rough area and I was held at gunpoint. The airbnb was in an incredibly dangerous ghetto (top 10 in the US according to the FBI) and I thought it was weird it wasn't mentioned anywhere. I gave it 4 stars for everything else, but removed 1 for the lack of a warning, because with that warning I could have been a little more careful with what I did. And the host appealed the review, Airbnb sided with them and nothing I said would warrant a reinvestigation. I've dropped them, hotels are better nowadays. Fuck Unfairbnb.",

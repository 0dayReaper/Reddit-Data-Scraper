    "postText": "Last time I went to hostel in Western Europe was years ago (pre COVID), since then I've mostly travelled Balkans, Turkey and Africa, but this year I wanted to go travelling in Italy and ... what the ever living hell? Hostel prices in basically all of North Italy in May and June, booked weeks in advance are 50 \u20ac at best and more often than not even 100 \u20ac for a bed in a 8 to 16 bed dormitory. A lot of the times they are more expensive than even cheap hotels room. Some of the hostels I remember had prices of 10 - 20 \u20ac pre COVID.\n\nWho is paying these prices? Weren't hostels supposed to be for \"budget\" travellers? Like, if you go travelling a month in Spain and Italy you have to budget easily 2000 \u20ac for staying in hostels alone. What the hell happened to hostels? Is it just for rich kids these days?",

Now, travel is back to basically what it was before, but there\u2019s significantly less hostels to accomodate. More demand, less supply, higher price.\n\nIf you put off your trip until October or November prices should be better. I went to Italy in November and was able to book a city centre hotel room in Florence for \u20ac65/night, and a room just around the corner from San Marcos Square in Venice for roughly the same price. Wasn\u2019t even cold",

The latest is the historic Roosevelt Hotel in midtown Manhattan, which shuttered three years ago and is reopening later this week as a welcome center and shelter for asylum seekers. In announcing the plan, city officials say they are doing so ahead of a possible surge in migrants because of a change in policy along the U.S.-Mexico border. As New York faces growing pressure to expand the city's shelter system, it is turning to vacant hotels to make more room for people who need a roof and a place to bunk down as they sort out their lives. A legal mandate requires the city to provide shelter to anyone who needs it.](https://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/nyc-hotels-shelters/image_4bd2aebc-e706-5ba5-8a6e-f6172846ca7a.html)",

            "comment": "I started traveling post covid so I may not be the best person to ask about this, but I think many factors are at play contributing to the massive spike in hostel prices:\n\n1) covid killed off a lot of hostels, so there is less supply and a higher demand of budget travelers. They are making a rebound slowly, but it may be a while until more budget hostels pop up.\n2) budget traveling has become more and more common and accessible to more people, which means greater supply and more competition for customers to get good prices on accommodation\n3) inflation most likely contributes a lot to the rising prices of hostel dorms as well\n4) rising rent prices across Europe, and the world, may have also impacted hostel dorms prices\n5) you\u2019re going to some of the most popular tourist destinations in the world at the peak season - naturally, accommodation is going to be more expensive during that time. Other parts of Europe are not as expensive during the summer. For example my hostel in Krakow I\u2019m staying in right now only costs around 10 euros per night. I am also going to the Balkans soon and the hostels there are like 15 euros a night max.\n\nThese are just a few reasons I came up with and they are just my predictions. I have no data to back up these claims but I feel like they are pretty reasonable guesses/assumptions as for why hostel dorm prices have exploded in recent years.\n\nIt is really unfortunate how expensive hostels have become now. When going to big tourist hubs during popular months I think it\u2019s pretty crucial to try and book accommodation in much in advance as you possibly can. Many hostels have a 100% free refund on cancellation policy so take advantage of that when booking! :)\n\nIf you are concerned about the cost of booking accommodation, I can recommend these tips:\n\n1) book in as far in advance as you can. This can save you a ton of cash and it\u2019s one of my biggest regrets from past travel spending habits, as I wish I was more organized and booked accommodation farther in advance.\n2) use booking.com to book all of your accommodation. They have a very favorable rewards system and that can cut a lot of the costs down on your hostels and other forms of accommodation.\n3) go off the beaten path. You wanna go to Amsterdam but are worried about dorm prices? Avoid Amsterdam, and go to Utrecht, Rotterdam, or any of the other amazing cities The Netherlands has to offer (and this goes for every other country). You will find much cheaper accommodation in less visited cities and towns in major countries, and you\u2019ll find lower prices in less toured countries of Europe such as Poland, Belarus, the Baltics, the Balkans, the Caucasus nations, etc.\n4) travel during the off-season. This is kind of a no-brainer but it\u2019s worth mentioning. Instead of going to Italy during July, go during October when the weather will still be decent, it\u2019ll be far less crowded, and prices for everything will drop significantly.\n\nIt\u2019s very easy nowadays to still find very affordable accommodation for travel, you just need to follow a couple of the steps above and it\u2019s easy!\n\nIf anyone has any further questions, feel free to PM me or respond! Would love to hear other tips for getting better accommodation prices from people.\n\nEdit: grammar + added more content",

I've also noticed that prices for the exact same hostel have doubled when you compare booking 4 months in advance vs. 2 months in advance.\n\nI personally hate that, because I prefer to stay flexible and adjust my travel plans to my mood.\n\nBut the only solution I see at the moment is indeed to book well in advance. Most hostels on [booking.com](https://booking.com) allow free cancellations (up to 3 to 7 days prior to arrival). That still allows for some flexibility. So I tend to book several hostels for the same dates - and cancel all but one. I don't like to do that but it seems that this is unfortunately what I have to do.",

Kinda lucky that I crossed off most of the expensive western destinations pre pandemic.\n\nI'd love to go back to Italy some day but I will avoid at those prices. If the prices never come anywhere close to what they were then no big loss, the world is a big place with many places waiting to be explored.

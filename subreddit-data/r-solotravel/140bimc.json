    "postText": "Just wanted to rant. My male solo traveller friends always tell me how fun xyz city is, I should go, it\u2019s SUPER SAFE. more than three times now the places I\u2019ve been to, even though it seems safe, is almost impossible to walk a block away from the hotel without constantly getting cat called or stared at like someone is going to eat you. I don\u2019t want to complain about solo travel - I still make it work, am super cautious and carry a huge metal water bottle as a weapon lol. It just gets exhausting. Yesterday I wore an oversized shirt, baggy pants to not attract attention and still men cannot stop themselves from being creepy. \n\nI know it\u2019s not all men, there are some beautiful and caring men out there. But it just gets so so so exhausting. I\u2019m so tired of not feeling safe just because I\u2019m a female. I think some men don\u2019t fully understand how difficult it can be to travel solo as a female sometimes and I wish the ones who cat call and follow you would just fuck off. Other women - what do you do to protect yourself?\n\nI\u2019m talking about central/Latin American by the way. I\u2019m not staying in sketchy areas either based on the reviews and what I read online\n\nSometimes it\u2019s almost better to befriend a male nearby who seems safe or find another woman, but it can be hard to do that everywhere\n\nEdit: thank you to everyone who feels me and the men and women that understand this.\n\nAlso, please join r/solofemaletravellers if you\u2019re interested",

Got propositioned multiple times for sex in public. I was completely covered up in loose clothes and a scarf covering my hair. Only skin showing were hands, neck, and face.\n\nTurkey was the second worst experience but mainly because of my friend's experience - she went running in a residential area without a lot of other people around and was followed by a guy on a moped/motorcycle who told her that he heard Americans girls love sex and kept telling her that he wanted to sex her up. Terrifying. \n\nThird worst was Italy. Some drunk guy tried to finger me at a bar and kept following me when I ran away until he came face to face with my male travel companions. He said something like \"oh sorry, I didn't know she was yours\" as if I was their property. So disgusting.\n\nThere was a year when I had to go to India 4 times for work - I felt totally fine in Mumbai but I took an Uber by myself from the airport to a friend's apartment in Delhi and I got scolded for taking such risks. I didn't spend much time in Delhi so not sure how much worse it is. Jodhpur felt a little sketchy at times but I felt pretty safe walking around in Jaipur and Udaipur. And generally I felt pretty ok in Goa.\n\nI actually felt very safe in Morocco even in the Fes medina walking home from dinner (outskirts of the medina though, not deep in the heart of it).",

I think it definitely helps but perhaps not to the extent that we would hope. In Turkey, I was pretty vigilant and felt largely ok in the touristy areas. But I remember that I kept getting propositioned for sex in Khan el-Khalili in Cairo when I went to Egypt in college. I was wearing a long skirt and a loose top (crew neckline), and I had wrapped a scarf around my head (not wrapped like a hijab - more draped over my head with one end tossed over a shoulder). We discussed it with our host and he said that there is just generally a belief that women from the US and Europe are always up for sex. I'm of Asian descent and they all thought I was Japanese or Chinese though - so I guess it extends to East Asia as well??",

It was probably a joke (hopefully), but still concerning after we had just come from a shop that had a guy trying to touch my ass and kiss me as I was trying to leave. Going out to Ephesus and going through the countryside was a much better experience and I didn't get harassed at all. I don't think I would travel back to Istanbul by myself since all of that happened within one day in the city. I will admit that at 16 I probably looked older (I've been 5'10\" since high school with curves), but just because I looked at least 18 doesn't excuse any of the behavior.",

There were ~10 ppl and there had been chatter until a couple seconds after I walked in. \n\nI paid, looked for the restroom, and noticed everyone staring at me as I walked to the bathroom. I came back out and decided to also get a Diet Coke for the road - the cashier literally told me that it might be a good call to not linger and skedaddle (not sure if he was trying to be helpful or threatening - I think the former tbh because I think he was a transplant as he didn't have any sort of accent and was pretty nice during both interactions). \n\nGot the f*** out of there but couldn't shake the feeling that I narrowly missed something dangerous.

I had a male show me around this park in broad daylight at 11am with people everywhere and he leaned in tryin to kiss me!!! Like what??

I dress normally anywhere I go, even if I feel like dressing up a bit. \nFor example when travelers wear Birkenstock sandals, in a place where NONE of the locals wear Birkenstock sandals, you\u2019re basically telling everyone that you\u2019re a foreigner. Isn\u2019t that the opposite if what you\u2019d want? If I alter my attire at all, it\u2019s to dress more like the locals in their style; not to dress down or look poor. A lot of travelers seem to get that wrong. When I travel, I can usually IMMEDIATELY tell who the travelers are because of the way they dress. They wear those Birkenstock sandals or the hiker-type boots, sometimes bucket hats. I refrain from wearing that type of clothing while traveling. You might as well wear a sign that says you\u2019re a foreigner. But for some reason, travelers love to wear them.\n\n*edited a few words to sound less harsh, sorry lol. Not telling anyone how to live their life :)",

They don't think of women as real people, who have hard days and deserve respect regardless.\n\nAnd it's frustrating because you're totally right, you can't do anything reasonable to prevent it. The only control we slightly have is how we react. I pity these men who never get to genuinely talk to women - women are awesome and they're missing out on some amazing friendships bc they can't function normally in society.\n\nAnd I feel pity for women in these places where it's extreme and they don't get to feel safe day to day",

And the women could never explain it, it always had to be the men. The American men would sometimes get frustrated at having to constantly correct the boys and start saying questionable things themselves - like how maybe the women that worked there should stop wearing... \"Tight\" pants (jeans or business pants), so they wouldn't have to tell the boys not to make comments or whistle.\n\nIt was really disheartening to imagine the women who live in those countries and dealt with it, with no man around to correct the behavior.

Well if that's how men feel, how do they think the object of their creepy behaviour feels?",

I was sexuality harassed in Thailand, (one guy even sat beside me in a public park, put his hand on my thigh and asked if I'd like to have sex in the public toilet... gross.) I got waaaay too much harassment in Tunisia and it really turned me off of the country. I was staying in a beach resort and most of the local men, including the housekeeping staff, front desk staff, excursion staff, jet ski renter staff and pretty much every other male local walking the streets said I was their future wife and insisted that we go out for \"coffee\" after hours. Even old man who sells camel rides on the beach wanted to hook up. People would cut me off walking down the sidewalk with their motor bikes to insist we go somewhere. It was so aggressive that my resting bitch face (normally I'm relaxed and approachable) became my walking around face. My guard was up the entire time. But.... these experiences don't stop me from traveling solo. Remember, it's okay to \"offend\" someone who is asking you for sex. Some women don't want to offend people, but I've learned that in some cultures it's a tactic to get the other person to cave. Remember, \"fuck off\" is universal. And sometimes you get a funny story out of it. In Thailand, our mountain trek guide hit on me constantly. He told me one night at the campfire that, I was \"big like Buddha\" so I would \"make a good wife.\" Lol.",

    "postText": "Hoping someone can shed some light here. \n\nI\u2019m solo travelling to Peru and will be in cusco June 14th, I have read many conflicting articles saying buy the tour in advance and also saying just buy in in cusco.  I was under the impression that Machu Picchu sells out weeks in advance and that\u2019s my main end goal to finish the hike at, so is it worth the risk to buy it in person? Or am I just overthinking this whole situation? I just don\u2019t want to finally make it to peru only to turned away because tickets are sold out. \n\nAlso I\u2019m travelling solo and I noticed a lot of the companies accommodations are for two travellers, will they usually take solo travellers ?\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "This happened to me last year. The actual 5 day hike to maccu Picchu is separate to the entrance to the site itself. The hiking portion has no limits and can be booked whenever but you need to book a ticket to the site in advance. I didn't realize this and ended up having to do the hike and site 10 days later than planned\n Wasn't a disaster because I had days to spare. Presumably you will want to enter the site with the rest of your tour group so I would recommend just booking the entire thing now. I went with machu Picchu reservations and they were great.",

That was about 4 years ago so no idea if things have changed. I paid about $200 but make sure you have some extra cash for the guides, cooks and porters as they get nothing from the organisers. I think I added around $40 or so to the pot. It's needed, if the cooks don't get tipped your food will be sparse and bad!",

DO NOT wait to have a tour company book those tickets\u2014 they are limited and even more so now that the Peruvian government is cracking down on the number of people allowed in Machu Picchu each day. LMK if you need a recommendation for a tour guide. BTW, I went solo and it was fine.",

I went in september.\n\nUsualy the trek operators already included tickets for Machu Picchu, so even when the regular tickets are sold out, you can still get in. Just make sure what's included.\n\nThe one trek that does get sold out fast is the Inca trail. Mostly because of its limitation on how many people can hike it per day.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m 30F and taking the US bar exam this year so I\u2019m treating myself to a solo trip to decompress with about 2 weeks. I\u2019d love some advice on my general plan and if I should spend more or fewer days in these cities/areas: \n\n- 3 days in Dublin (I\u2019d love to know if there\u2019s particularly good hostels for making friends and night life) (I\u2019m not too old for a hostel right? Haven\u2019t stayed in one since college) \n\n- 3 days in Galway (I\u2019ll be there for the weekend) \n\n- 4 days in and around Isle of Skye (thinking of renting a car and hiking, any advice of where is worth spending time is helpful) \n\n- 2 days in Inverness (interested in the history and hiking, is this enough?) \n\n- 3 days in Stockholm \n\n\nMy questions are: \nIs this too busy? \nShould I spend more days in one place vs another? \nAny great experiences in these places that I shouldn\u2019t miss? \nAny advice if you\u2019ve been there before? \n\nI\u2019ve been to Glasgow and Edinburgh which I why I\u2019m effectively skipping them. Thanks for the help!",

            "comment": "Stockholm seems kinda far off from everything else on your itinerary. I would cut that out and place those days in Ireland or Scotland if it were me. The Scandinavian countries should really be their own trip, imo. \n\nAlso, you are never too old for a hostel, except for maybe party hostels and youth hostels. Lots of upper 20somethings and 30somethings stay in hostels! \n\n 2 days in Inverness seems really short to be in that area, there's tons of neat outdoors stuff to do in that region like hiking and lots of sights to see aside from just Inverness and Loch Ness. Assuming you were to shave Stockholm off of there, you could place another day in Inverness or allot a day for a cool road trip through the Highlands from the Isle of Skye to Inverness, then drive down to Edinburgh and hit up Cairngorms National Park on the way to maybe spend a day or two there before flying home out of Edinburgh.",

            "comment": "Dubliner here. My advice would be to get the cheapest option you can, it\u2019s ridiculously expensive for accommodation (sorry!). \n\nI think hostels would be fine (nobody will care you\u2019re 30). There are plenty of touristy group activities you can join in and honestly, it\u2019s the type of city where you can strike up a conversation in a pub. \n\nGalway is a fun city with great pubs (Tigh Neachtain and the Crane for starters) though it rains a lot. Nice restaurant called Ard Bia. Day trip to the Cliffs of Moher / Burren. Another to the Aran Islands (where they shot much of the Banshees of Inisherin).\n\nStockholm in three days is plenty. Don\u2019t know about Skye or Inverness but the Scots are sound.\n\nWhat kind of things are you interested in? Happy to make some suggestions.\n\nHere are my favourite pubs I recommend to visitors, they are local rather than the touristy Temple Bar ones. All of these do excellent Guinness.\n\n**The Long Hall** (George's St) - great pub, ornate drinking spot. (Bruce Springsteen's favourite when in town).\n\n**Grogan's** (South William Street) - old school no frills boozer, artsy, friendly crowd. The menu has two items - toasted sandwiches and Kit Kats. Three if you include pints.\n\n**Kehoe's** (South Anne Street, just off Grafton St) - if it's busy downstairs, try upstairs, it's like a country manor. There is a snug near the door but good luck getting seats.\n\n**The Stag's Head** (Dame Court, off Dame Street) - try the little room with the stained glass ceiling. These days can be a bit touristy.\n\n**Neary's** (Chatham St) - often busy downstairs so try upstairs.\n\n**The Lord Edward** (across from Christ Church) - upstairs is open Thurs/Fri/Sat only. Cosy pub, creamy pints, fireplace. Burdock\u2019s chipper next door.\n\n**The Palace** (Fleet St, edge of Temple Bar) - lovely room at the back of pub, popular with writers over the years. There\u2019s a tiny snug if it's available.\n\n**Bowe's** (Fleet St, across the road) - very good selection of whiskey.\n\n**Mulligan's** (Poolbeg St) - old school authentic pub.\n\n**The Cobblestone** (Smithfield) - 10 mins from centre by LUAS/bus/taxi, good place to see traditional Irish music every night.    \n\n**Frank Ryan's** (Queen St, Smithfield) - lively bar, sometimes with music. Resident dog. Edit: best pizza in Dublin out the back.\n\n**The Gravediggers** (next to Glasnevin cemetery, a historic place with a round tower).\n\n**Anseo** (Wexford St) - young, lively bar.\n\n**Harbour Bar, Bray** (great pub if you\u2019re out this direction, live music everywhere, pints, fish n chips)\n\nDay trip to Howth / Dalkey / Malahide / Bray on DART.\n\nLots of museums and galleries. \n\nKilmainham Gaol and IMMA an interesting combo. Newgrange and Hill of Tara as a day trip for ancient Celtic/pagan history.\n\nLive music [gig guide](https://nialler9.com/the-nialler9-dublin-gig-guide-may-bank-holiday-edition/) (non-traditional). Whelan\u2019s always has something on.\n\n[Three Castles Burning](https://podtail.com/en/podcast/three-castles-burning/) is the the best history podcast about Dublin - I think he might still do some walking tours.\n\nAnd here\u2019s my own [playlist of Irish music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1hr4qFJ7y8MKr1Au5RRB6I?si=t4zlhCwaRb6b97cbf4p-ww) to set the scene.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any questions.\n\nEdit: looks like you\u2019ll be taking the Dublin bar exam too.",

You might enjoy the [National Museum: Decorative Arts and History](https://www.museum.ie/en-ie/museums/decorative-arts-history) at Collins Barracks and also the [Archaeology](https://www.museum.ie/en-IE/Museums/Archaeology) one, I think there\u2019s a ceramics room there. All national museums are free.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of [shops and galleries](https://ceramicartsnetwork.org/ceramics-monthly/ceramics-monthly-article/Clay-Culture-Dublin-Ireland-City-Guide-180152) with ceramics, you can probably chat to people there or email organisations for more suggestions.\n\nI really like the [National Gallery](https://www.nationalgallery.ie) as it\u2019s a nice building and gives a good overview of Irish art. Jack B. Yeats is a favourite, brother of the poet (there\u2019s a free exhibition about him near the National Library). It\u2019s next to Merrion Square, where Oscar Wilde was born.\n\nFor example, you could go to the National Gallery, the National Museum Archaeology around the corner and then have a wander around Stephen\u2019s Green, then Trinity College nearby to see the Long Room and Book of Kells. All very close.\n\nOr go to the museum at Collins Barracks, walk across the river to IMMA (modern art museum with nice grounds) and then Kilmainham Gaol (pre-book) a prison that\u2019s an important site for Irish independence. Then a pint at the Royal Oak, great little pub nearby. Maybe the Cobblestone for a spot of trad music afterwards.\n\nMost tourists go to the Guinness brewery. It does have a good view of the city and the tourists enjoy it, it\u2019s obviously not aimed at me. The Teeling whiskey distillery is also quite fun.\n\nThe Phoenix Park is also lovely as a green space next to the city (hire a Dublin Bike if you\u2019re a cyclist) and you can see the deer and on some days visit the President\u2019s house - Michael D., everyone loves him. Good pubs near there: the Hole in the Wall and Ryan\u2019s on Parkgate St (cool snugs).\n\nHowth, Dalkey, Malahide and Bray also a nice escape from the city centre. \n\nMalahide is a seaside town with a castle you can do a tour of. \n\nHowth has lots of fish restaurants and a very nice (easy) [cliff walk](https://www.visitdublin.com/cliff-path-loop).\n\nDalkey is a small village, Finnegan\u2019s a decent pub (Bono\u2019s local). Bray a few stops more on Dart with a popular walk to Greystones. \n\nYou can buy a Leap card for travel if planning to use public transport a lot, though centre of town can be covered on foot. There\u2019s also a hop on hop off tour bus which could be useful.",

I'll share what I've found from research and Irish/Northern English friends, but we should definitely share info once one of us has actually seen it in person.\n\nThere are plenty of amazing looking places on Skye that will be worth a look, but are well known and traveled such as the Trotternish Peninsula (old man of Storr, the Quiraing, Skye Museum of Island Life), Neist Point Lighthouse, and the Fairy Pools. I think the best hikes I've found that may be off the beaten track are Oronsay Tidal Island (Ullinish), Coire Lagan, and Loch Coruisk. For the Skye portion I will be with my parents, but if I were solo and had the time and fair weather, I would definitely take a ride from Elgol to Loch Coruisk with Misty Isle Boat Trips and then see the loch and forgo the return journey for a relatively flat 6.4 mile trek to Elgol along the shore with sights of the Cuillin hills. I have also heard great things about the Applecross peninsula, but it does not fit into our itinerary unfortunately.\n\nI have heard that Inverness is not a strictly exciting town on its own, but the area around it is definitely worth visiting. I am personally excited to go to Culloden, the Clava Cairns, and the Tomatin Distillery (generally the area near the river Spey is well known for Whiskey). There are also some great looking places on the drive between the Isle of Skye and Inverness/Glasgow, but I'm not sure of your exact route.\n\nGood luck on the bar and on the trip! Sounds like a wonderful experience",

            "comment": "I'm from Edinburgh. I'd aim to spend as much of your time in the north west of Scotland as possible. There are some nice spots around Inverness, sure, but it just doesn't compare to the rugged landscapes you'll find if you venture further west, in my opinion. \n\nFor Skye, the Quiraing is my favourite and Old Man of Storr is really special. I was underwhelmed by the fairy pools and fairy glen tbh, they're obviously popular, but didn't feel particularly unique in the grand scheme of Scottish landscapes. A drive down to Torrin/towards Elgol is also worth a stop to see the Cuillins. Amy's Place Tea Room has a great view outside at their picnic benches, if you catch nice weather. If you're looking for wildlife, I did this walk a week ago and saw seals as well as an otter eating a salmon (which was then stolen by crows): [https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/skye/rubhaardnish.shtml](https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/skye/rubhaardnish.shtml). I'd only do this walk if it's dry weather, and the end point can only be reached when the tide is low. Neist Point is a good spot for minke whale-watching from land, if you're lucky, and we saw lots of seals on the drive up there too.\n\nJust a thought, but you could weigh up the cost of renting a small camper van vs car + accommodation, and you could reach more places in less time and use a bit less fuel on the back and forth. It might allow you to visit Skye then continue north to Applecross, Torridon, NC500 route. Although, you'd need to be a confident driver (on a left-hand-drive single-track cliff-edge road) for the Bealach Na Ba pass to Applecross.\n\nIf you haven't been to Glencoe, it should be top of your list to visit, even if it's just a drive through. You have lots of options in the highlands. You could literally just drive up the north west coast and see stunning landscapes the whole way.",

I hadn\u2019t planned a stop around there, but with this feedback I booked one night in Kilchoan to explore the far west side and be closer to Fort William and now Glencoe. Is there any great spots between Glencoe and Kilchoan you\u2019d recommend too? \n\nAnd I\u2019m actually very nervous about driving on the left. It\u2019ll be my first time, but years ago I lived in Yorkshire and was always too afraid to try so I never got to see this part of the world. Now I want to get over that, but I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019ll be. Is it tricky driving these routes?",

Don\u2019t let other cars get you worked up about going fast, just let them pass you and take your time to enjoy the scenery. They\u2019ll appreciate that more than you trying to keep their pace anyway. You can pull in to a passing/rest place to let others past you, or you can signal to the left if you\u2019re on a clear straight 2-lane road and that lets people behind you know you\u2019re letting them overtake you. Remember that you always stay on the left, so for example on a single track road, a passing place on the left means that you go into it to let an oncoming car pass. If the passing place is on your right, you stop on the road just before it and let the oncoming car go into it, then drive past them. Try not to double up with other cars on single track so you can fit into passing places. I do see a lot of people driving too far to the left and clipping the edge of the road with their back wheel, so try to get a good feel of the width of the vehicle before you get on narrower roads.\n\nIs it Kilchoan - Oban or Ardnamurchan? For hikes, dig through that Walk Highlands website I linked, and be sure to keep an eye on the \u2018bog factor\u2019 element.",

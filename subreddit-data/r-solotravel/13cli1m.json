    "postText": "I\u2019m currently on my first international Solo trip to Bali and I completely miscalculated it. I flew here just with one backpack and a reservation for 2 nights in a hostel in Ubud. I didn\u2019t really plan on where to go next and thought I\u2019d just \u201cgo with the flow\u201d and be spontaneous, but that\u2019s quite hard for me right now. I wanted to stay a night or two longer in Ubud, but everything that would meet my price expectations and would be kind of in the center of the city is sold out (which is unfortunate, but I guess I can just take one that\u2019s further away)\n\nI also thought I\u2019d have a plan on what to do by now, but turns out I don\u2019t lol. I kind of know that I want to go to Canggu, I kind of know that I want to go onto Nusa Penida. But a lot of people keep telling me to do this and that, and to not do Nusa Penida or Canggu right now but rather next week, \u2026 \n\nAdding to that I\u2019ve suddenly experienced home sickness last night, which I\u2019ve never had, but I also had never been this far from home. \n\nJust wanted to rant - has anybody experienced things like these before? Not knowing what to do because there are so many things to do? Would love to know your experiences that are similar to this one :)",

It's quiet, friendly, it's got a really nice beach boardwalk you can walk or bike along.

            "comment": "haha, I have been there, do not worry, those are sweet troubles\n\nThe thing you should ask yourself: did you really miscalculate if you did not calculate at all?\n\nI think there are two kinds of people when traveling: those who like to plan every day and detail, and those who do not. Nothing wrong with both ways, but it is best to decide which style you prefer.\n\nFor me, the mix of the two proved to be the best: when I go I have a general idea of places and sights I would like to see, but I do not plan too much. It gives you a sense of direction but does not limit you to improvisation. It does take its toll in the sense that you might not find the best price/value in terms of hostels, but I realized that you can sleep anywhere for a night or two, and as long as you can take a shit and a shower, it should be fine\n\nAlso, do not be upset about feeling like there are too many things to see: when I visited Bali and Indonesia in particular, I also felt overwhelmed, first because it is such a rich and diverse country with a lot of things to see, do, taste and visit, but also since it is one big touristic machinery that can sometimes feel grinding for a traveler. My advice would be to take it slow, stay at places for a longer stretch of days, take your time when visiting sites, and maybe set your interest straight: do you wanna do national parks or cities, wanna see the nightlife or hang out on beaches\n\nAnd I would definitely visit Nusa Penida if I were you:). In my travel through SE Asia, this place for some reason left a strong impression, a strange land formation of the island with really large, tall cliffs, sandy beaches all the way down, mountain top of the island... Also, there is Karangsari cave, a cave temple I have never seen alike before... and also one more temple which I can not recall the name of now, placed in the middle of the cliff, accessible by some shitty, really exciting stairs and 200m long hike down... Actually, Nusa Penida is really great and I wish you have a great fun on your trip:D",

Sometimes I like to go with the flow, and other times I\u2019m glad to be following a plan.  Nowadays I usually know my must-visits and must-dos ahead of time so I won\u2019t regret not doing them. I also book refundable whenever possible so I can change things on the go if I feel like it.\n\nGood luck and enjoy your trip!",

In theory, SE asia is the easiest to wing, but imo there's simply a lot you can't wing.\n\nWhen most people say they're \"winging it\" or \"going with the flow\" they mean they have the area researched, know any POIs, how long they might want to spend, what needs to be booked. And then they'll wake up and decide what interests them that day of the non committal activities (ie no reservation). \n\nIn reality, I'd always make sure you have a place to stay for at least the next 3 days, preferably a week. Make sure you have plans on how to get from place to place. Trains/planes/buses whatever. Understand if they require booking/are likely to be booked up.\n\nThese are the 2 big aspects that if you fuck up can be trip ruining.\n\nThe point of \"going with the flow\" is that you should already know all the decisions you can make, like which areas of the country to explore and what you can do there, ideally before you go. Then you can make the decision a week before, after interacting with other travelers or locals that give you advice",

Trust your gut, look up a few interesting places and decide where you want to go next. I\u2019ve been to Canggu and thought it was very nice, but in my experience very little to do. I then proceeded to Padang Bai, where I stayed for two nights before I boarded the boat to the Gili islands, stayed a couple nights on each island except for the honeymoon island whose name I cannot recall. I was a very young solo female traveler, and it was quite the experience to travel on your own and decide on the go. There are so many nice people, who\u2019ll help you and lots of people you will meet along the way. I kind of regret not going to Lombok and Nusa Penida, so I would defo recommend going there.

I stayed on Lembongan and did a day trip to Penida. From there, you can get a ferry to the Gili Islands, highly recommend! Gili T if you want to party. From the Gili Islands, you can easily go back to Sanur, where you can get a Grab taxi to Canggu and finish your trip there as it's near to the airport.\n\nIf you have time, have a look into Komodo, it is amazing.

Now grab your phone and check availabilities for beds on your budget for these places - Hostelworld, booking.com, whatever your poison. How are you getting there? Check into travel options - minibus? Grab? Gojek? Book at least two nights at your next stop to give you some breathing space. Next, get on the road and do!

I stayed for 3 months and I still felt like I could\u2019ve done more.\n\nyou\u2019ve really got to think what you want. Some people swore by ubud, but I really didn\u2019t like it. Some people hated canggu and that\u2019s where I spent the majority of my time. It\u2019s a place that has a lot for everyone. So just breathe! It\u2019s YOUR solo trip. It\u2019s YOUR plan.",

There\u2019s often sag clubs with like a 100-200k minimum spend which is very easy to hit.\n\nI loved watching the sunset at the beach. Near the lawn, there\u2019s pop up bars that serve drinks and I would just sit there with my book :)\n\nI also lived there so I did lots of classes like dance classes, Pilates etc. was really fun",

It will help you find what interests you and there's always the internet you can check for recommendations outside the locality of your area. always follow what you want to do and go to where you wanted to go.",

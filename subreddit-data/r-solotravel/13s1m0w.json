    "postText": "Hi, is USD$4000 enough for 2 months of travel in South America? (excluding flights to/from and within SA- I\u2019ve put that in a separate budget)\n\nCurrently, I\u2019ve decided on Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. I\u2019ll be staying in hostels and won\u2019t be partying much/drinking much alcohol, but I would like to join a few guided treks which would seem to hike up (aha) the budget a little (from what I\u2019ve researched so far the 5 day Lost City Trek in Colombia alone would cost about USD$500?). In terms of food, I\u2019m okay with cooking food for myself/eating local street food. \n\nThe budgets I\u2019ve seen so far seem to suggest that USD$50 per day is more than enough, and from my budget I\u2019d have about USD$70 per day. However, I\u2019m not too sure whether these budgets include activities. \n\nHere is a (preliminary) plan of key activities I would like to do in each country: \n1. Colombia (3 weeks): Lost City Trek, Cocora Valley hike, Pablo Escobar tour in Medellin, maybe paragliding/some other activities in San Gil \n2. Ecuador (2 weeks): Visiting Otavalo market, Cotopaxi trek, Cloud Forest, some acitivities in Banos?\n3. Peru (3 weeks): Salkantay trek, Colca Canyon, Rainbow mountains? \n\nThese are just some activities I\u2019ve seen based on very quick research, so I would be open to adding some/removing some! \n\nLastly, do you guys have any tips on booking tours in South America? In SEA, tours were easily bookable via hostels, so I was wondering whether it\u2019s the same thing in SA. Thank you!",

            "comment": "I would recommend Machu Piccu Reservations for the Salkantay trek. It cost me $180 for the 5 day trek, all accom and meals included except for food on the last day in Aguas Calientes. Very reputable company and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.\n\nDo not pay more than $300 for the Lost City trek. Any more than $300 and it's a third party company hiking up the price.\n\nBook all of your tours in person, it is nearly always significantly cheaper.\n\nDo not do a Pablo Escobar tour in Medellin. It memorialises a terrorist as a tourist attraction and Medellin locals do not even speak his name. Instead opt for a free walking tour of downtown Medellin and another of Comuna 13. They will cover the time of P.E in an incredibly educational vut respectful manner, and then you can tip them accordingly. I went with RealCity tours and Zippy tours and they are both the best walking tours I have ever done.\n\nI have travelled all three countries, and I think your budget is definitely more than manageable. I spent less than your budget personally. Remember that you will be spending less than $70 per day to account for the activity days where you will spend more. Also note that buses with border crossings will likely be more expensive, just again something to consider when on a budget.",

Is it also via Hostelworld, or did book it when you actually reached Peru? Thank you!",

Also, maybe be willing to pay a little more your first day, just to feel good (still in a hostel though) If you are landing in Peru/Lima- book a hostel in Miraflores. This is the best area I also recommend getting the latest copy of Lonely Planet for South America instead of just googling/the internet This is great to read from one place to the other, and you get all the little tips that necessarily isn\u2019t online :) The first night In Peru, but from then on I either used the Lonely Planet-guide to find a place Or booked on the spot when I reached a town. In most of the places people with hostels will approach you at the bus-station, and give you offers that are cheaper than on the internet! You can just say no if you want to, but most often than not the hostels are really great and I met fellow travelers from all over the world. I know Peru most of all from the countries you mention so don\u2019t hesitate if you need more tips :)",

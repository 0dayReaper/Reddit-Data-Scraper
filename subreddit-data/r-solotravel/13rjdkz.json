I want to learn web development and I'm taking 6 months off work to learn this. If I can or can't learn it is a different matter. \n\nI have a flight to Singapore then I either plan to rent for 6 months in Bangkok or rent a few different places for one month at a time.\n\nWhat are people's thoughts on this?\n\nI have travelled SEA before so I don't plan on doing a big backpack route as I'd like somewhere i could focus on learning most of the time.\n\nPro BKk 6 months.\n\nGet a nicer apartment for cheaper as it's a longer rent.\nCould still fly out to different countries once a month for visa run\n\nPros 6 cities in 6 months \n\nExplore more places, more cultures \nNever get bored as each month would be different.\n\n\nIdk not best list but what's everyone's thoughts, would you prefer have a home base and do smaller trips to other places or stay in 6 different places for the 6 months and if the latter which cities would you choose? \n\nObv I want to keep costs to a minimum as in going SEA as it's cheaper than England to live. \n\nThanks :)",

That helps keep costs low and it will help keep you in the study mindset.",

When I went to Bangkok recently I was pretty surprised at how much more expensive it seemed, especially compared to their neighbouring countries.\n\nBangkok is definitely a lot more developed though. I liked Hanoi more than HCMC personally and Bangkok over HCMC for me but it may be worth checking it out. 15 day visa sounds like a drag though.\n\nBut if you feel Bangkok is well within your budget then go for it! At the very least it\u2019s a good base to move around from. Are you looking for city life or a more chill, laid back environment?",

Obviously it is more expensive but the vacation/visit aspect of it can help you pace yourself as you\u2019re learning. There\u2019s so much info one can take in daily or everyday all the time. It would be different if you knew what you were doing and had a project where you can work all day straight, but when it comes to learning I think taking breaks to do some sightseeing and let yourself absorb the concepts and skills you spent 6h the day before learning is better. But need to be disciplined and remain constant with the learning schedules",

A flight in then out, every month to try and stay for 6 months(or indefinitely), is effectively just longterm staying without filling out the proper paperwork. \n\nOther countries will just set it up so that you cannot stay more than 90 days in any 180 day period(and will sometimes deny you if they think you've spent too much time in that year), but SE asia countries give the liberty to the border agents. \n\nYou're thinking of it as more of a \"loophole\" or a \"cheat\" to stay in a country indefinitely, but countries do try to stop people from cheating the system and staying indefinitely in their country.\n\nThe big issue is you're gambling with a lot, and can get colossally fucked.",

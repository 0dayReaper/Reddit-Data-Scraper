    "postText": "Hey y'all, long time lurker and finally mustered up the courage to do my first solo trip! Have travelled before, but was always with at least one friend. Wanted to get some advice on my itinerary!\n\nPriorities/About me:\n\n* 23 M based in San Francisco, relatively flexible budget\n* I'm pretty social and expecting/hoping to meet other solo travelers in hostels (though don't mind doing some stuff alone)\n* Prefer doing chill things to partying, but enjoy partying ever once in a while for sure\n* Don't want to be rushed in any place. Am ok with cutting out parts of my trip in order to not be rushed\n* Love nature + outdoorsy stuff and being active\n\nItinerary so far (City/Island- Hostel):\n\n* Crete (Chania) (4 nights) -  Cocoon City Hostel\n* Crete (Rethymno) (4 nights) - Rethymno Youth Hostel\n* Ios (2-3 Nights)  -  Francesco's\n* Santorini (3-4 nights) - Caveland\n* Athens/Meteora (1 day? See Question #5) \n\nI have a round trip booked to Athens (flying to Chania immediately after landing)\n\nMain Questions:\n\n1. Are any of these islands/hostels not great for solo travel?\n2. Is it too rushed - should I cut out a destination or two? \n3. Should I avoid Ios if I don't wanna be partying the whole time? I'm cool with partying but don't want it to be the only thing I'm doing\n4. Is Santorini worth it solo?\n5. Is a day trip to Meteora from Athens feasible or would I need more time? \n\nWould greatly appreciate any other general recommendations/advice! Thanks",

            "comment": "I was there last September. I went to Santorini as it was the cheapest flight but didn't enjoy the island too much. It was just touristy and didn't feel greek (like other islands or the mainland). I did go hiking which was nice but also super busy. I did meet quite a few people in the hostel but wouldn't go back.\nI also went to Ios (also francescos). Was quite nice as it was already off season and hiking there felt like having the whole island to myself. Met quite a few people and the go out every night, within walking distance so easy to get back whenever you want. The hostel has a pool with a nice view. But I felt like there weren't too many restaurant option but totally fine for a few days.",

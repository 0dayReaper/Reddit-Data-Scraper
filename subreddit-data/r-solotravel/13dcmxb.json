I have been to 40 countries, including places that are widely regarded to be difficult destinations.\n\nI'm  considering doing Egypt alone, without a formal, multi-day tour. I have zero interest in joining something like a Contiki or Intrepid tour; I have always booked everything on my own for previous trips, but I'd certainly do day tours where relevant.\n\nI am looking to do the standard ancient historical sites in Cairo, Luxor, Aswan, etc.\n\nI'm hoping to spend somewhere between 1-2 weeks in Egypt, as part of a larger 4-6 week trip also including Israel, Lebanon, and Jordan in late summer/early fall of this year.\n\nI'd say I have a mid-range backpacker travel style and budget. I'd like to stay in hostels dorms, would likely use a combination of local buses and taxis, generally eat street food with some groceries and restaurants as well, etc.\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for hostels, day tours,  guides/drivers to hire for a day or two, etc?",

            "comment": "I did a couple weeks in Egypt last spring, as a fellow disliker of long group tours here are my thoughts;\n\n1. Egypt is a very inexpensive place to visit. You can get a nice private room on a budget instead of a hostel dorm if you prefer.\n2. Walking the streets solo is difficult. I never felt \"unsafe\" (though I am male so your experience may be different) but as a white westerner I stick out. And due to the poverty large portions of the population face there I couldn't walk a single block without 3-5 people coming up and offering to show me how to get where I am going, be my guide for the day, etc. An extreme introvert like me did not enjoy this one bit and so despite my desire to DIY and \"just go see things\" I recommend using guides everywhere in Egypt. Everyone else leaves you alone when you are with one. A guide for the day, with driver, is still very inexpensive and you learn so much more about the history and meanings of locations from them than by looking around on your own.\n3. Have a lot of cash for tipping (obvs not all on you at the same time), save any small bills for minor tips.\n4. I arranged a few day trip tours via Viator, not a long group tour. This resulted in a 1 on 1 experience with my tour guides. I was never in a tour group with strangers, except when I took a hot air balloon ride at sunrise over Luxor.\n5. By doing this, if you find a guide you really like, let them know where else you want to go in that city/area and they will be more than willing to set you up. You can cancel your other Viator (or whatever you use) tours and deal with that guide rather than keep going with luck of the draw each day. I really liked my guide Mohammed in Cairo and my guide Shaimaa in Luxor was the absolute best. I've hooked a few people up with her since.\n6. I had no issues at the train stations, it was not similar to my experiences walking the streets. Caveat I did have drivers picking me up from the station.",

Don\u2019t let people talk you out of going if you feel ok after reading people\u2019s personal experiences, which it sounds like you have. \n\nI didn\u2019t feel unsafe except when I was in the car alone with the guide as mentioned above and maybe at night walking to my hotel with 2 other girls. It\u2019s not an experience exclusive to Egypt, unfortunately. \n\nMy guided tour played a part in me feeling fine. But I recognize that it basically kept me in my comfort zone because I had a \u201csafe\u201d person (guide and travelers) I knew I could rely on the entire time I was in this chaotic place. That\u2019s why I wanted to go on a group tour. \nSounds like you are happy pushing your comfort zone! Take precautions and enjoy it!",

I spent 20 years of my life here and I still have barely scratched the surface of this utterly magnificent land. \n\n\nSure, there\u2019s a risk of dying but it\u2019s like any other place you go - be aware/learn about the dangers, how to respond to them, pay attention to what\u2019s happening around you, listen to warnings, and you will reduce the chances. \n\nAlaska has a significant tourism industry and it\u2019s very easy to find tours of all kinds and travel safely. There\u2019s a train that runs from Seward to Anchorage to Denali Nat\u2019l Park to Fairbanks. It\u2019s a fun ride, you get to see great scenery, and it\u2019s very safe. \nThere are loads of kayak tours, fishing tours are big business, as are guided hunts. Guided hunts can be very expensive so be prepared for some serious sticker shock. But they usually include food, shelter, and transportation from a location in Alaska (e.g. Anchorage) out to the hunting camp. Also know hunting laws, rules, and regulations, and realize that there might be some operations that might flout the law, so vet the guide! (I personally know a hunting guide who offen flouted the law and he got into serious trouble, as did the hunter.) \n\n\nA few dangers to be aware of that might get less press than bears and earthquakes: \n\nMoose. They are usually content to live and let live, but If they feel threatened or agitated they might attack. Especially this time of year when they have babies. Moose are bigger than most horses and can run up to 35 mph. \nIt\u2019s possible to see them on trails in Anchorage or out hiking. If you do see a moose your safest option is to avoid them- turn around and go back, or take a different path or detour. Today I saw a mama moose with twins. She was super relaxed but we took no chances and took a detour. We also warned others we met on the trail that there was a mama moose ahead. \nIf a moose does charge at you, try to take cover behind a tree, or other large object. \n\nMudflats, especially in the Anchorage area. Do \ud83d\udc4f Not \ud83d\udc4f Go \ud83d\udc4f Out \ud83d\udc4f On \ud83d\udc4f The Mudflats.[You can get stuck in the mud and drown when the tide comes in, like this poor guy did a few weeks ago.](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2023/05/22/illinois-man-stuck-in-mud-flats-near-hope-drowns-on-incoming-tide/) The Turnagain Arm by Anchorage has tides around 25 feet. \n\nSome of my favorite places are Eklutna Lake, Chena hot springs, Kennecott, and the Matanuska Glacier (also has guided tours available.)",

If you want any more details about anything, don't hesitate to ask!\n\nI was up there all of August last year. I flew into Anchorage with a bunch of camping gear, picked up a rental car, and started heading south to the Kenai peninsula. I spent two weeks down there. Mostly just camping and doing little day hikes, but in the town of Seward, I did a guided sea kayaking day trip, which was an absolute blast.\n\nAfter the Kenai, I headed north to Denali, stopping along the way in the town of Talkeetna, where I took a sight-seeing flight in a small plane through the mountains and around the summit of Denali. We also landed on a glacier and had the chance to walk around on it.\n\nAfter Denali, I headed back down to Anchorage, where I boarded a flight to Juneau. The reason my Alaska trip finally happened last year after being high on my list for four years was because a friend had just moved to Juneau, so I spent my final week up there visiting her. It was a lot more relaxed than the rest of my time in Alaska, staying in her guest bedroom rather than my tent, but between the down time just hanging out, I definitely got out for a few hikes around Juneau.\n\nI've always lived in cities myself, but many of my earliest memories are from the camping trips my parents would take me on during the summers of my youth. In my late teens, I started getting back into camping on my own after a bit of a break. Alaska definitely intimidated me a bit at first, but it's honestly not that bad. Obviously you need to be careful, but if you go when the weather is nicest in June and July, the bears will have plenty of salmon that makes for much easier eating than stealing from humans, and the hiking trails will be populated with plenty of other people.\n\nI feel like I kind of did Alaska on easy mode, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. For one thing, I'm just not interested in hunting, or fishing for that matter. But also, like I mentioned, grizzly bears were somewhat new to me. Prior to that trip, I've been a decently accomplished outdoorsman; a few years ago, I loaded a bunch of camping gear onto my bicycle and spent the better part of the next seven months riding 5,300 miles (8,500 km) around the western US. When I started thinking about Alaska four or five years ago, the plan was to do it by bike, but I'm glad that didn't work out. Now that I'm familiar with the state and comfortable with it, I definitely want to revisit that idea of a bike packing trip up there eventually.\n\n...I might have lost sight of your question there a little bit, I apologize if I rambled. I guess the point is that even with my past experience camping, I can empathize with your apprehensions about a place as rugged and wild as Alaska. But it's a popular place among outdoorsy tourists. If there's something you want to do there that you don't feel comfortable trying on your own, chances are good you'll be able to find a guide to take you.",

Both regions are really, really beautiful so you won't make a mistake with either of them. In the Amazon region, you will feel more immersed, more lost in the best kind of way, it's just so huge and... mighty. The Pantanal is somewhat less known among tourists and pretty spectacular. It feels more open, less dark and mysterious. I think the trip over to Paraguay is cool, I went over to Bolivia via Corumb\u00e1 and Puerto Quijarro and had a really good time.

I really had no expectations but I was completely blown away.\n\nThe amalgamation of architecture styles between soviet bloc, baroque, with gold-domed orthodox churches and more neo-modern buildings scattered around felt far more interesting than most of the European cities I\u2019ve been to. Kyiv of course has a significant history right up today, giving all manner of history buff an exciting opportunity to learn. We took a day trip to Chernobyl which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget.\n\nThe people were incredibly friendly, the nightlife was really good (knowing a bit of broken Croatian sort of helped us get by) and service staff in bars and restaurants were some of the most professional I\u2019ve come across. At one point one of the bartenders casually mentioned that she had recently won a bartending competition across the continent.\n\nThe metro system was probably the easiest I\u2019ve ever used, and cost next to nothing (as did a lot of things). During the evenings there was a lot of bright, colourful lighting amongst the streets and mashup of architectural styles, giving a sort of existential cyberpunk vibe to the city.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to return once this madness ends, and I\u2019m sure being in the geopolitical spotlight will encourage others to visit too.",

The city definitely exceeded my expectations. Granted, I was there this past Friday-Monday which was a holiday weekend and the weather was literally perfect, but the city just felt so pleasant, like just a nice place to be. It was so lively without feeling obnoxiously touristy. There were so many families with little kids there, to an extent that I don\u2019t think I have seen anywhere else on this trip so far. And it was far prettier than I anticipated. There is even a certain appeal to many of the post-war apartment buildings. It felt like a city that isn\u2019t handicapped by trying to preserve its history while also putting their history on full display and not shying away from it, no matter how terrible it is. I may not have taken as many pictures in Berlin as I did in most of the other cities I have been to, but as far as places where I just enjoyed being, it might be my favorite city so far.\n\nOn the opposite end, I was kinda disappointed by Prague, which I came from just beforehand. Not because it\u2019s an ugly city, it\u2019s of course stunningly beautiful, but I had it so hyped up to me beforehand but I was incredibly disappointed by how difficult it was to take pictures in the city because of all the cars everywhere. The number of cars in Berlin was bad but it\u2019s different since it\u2019s not trying to be some fairytale kind of city, while Prague definitely feels more like it is, but the cars took so much away from it for me. The tourist crowds were also quite bad.",

The Museum (MAS) is incredible, and it still holds the title of the best Hostel either of us has ever stayed at (yust). This was 5ish years ago, but would love to go back. \n\nBratislava, Slovakia. My Girlfriend and I were going from Vienna to Budapest (also underrated IMO) via train, and decided to spend 10ish hours in Bratislava on the way. We fell in love and wished we had budgeted time to stay for a few days. The castle on top of the hill is not your stereotypical castle, but it\u2019s amazing!

Basque Country is so much more mountainous and green than I imagined it would be. Did very little research before coming just wanted to escape the Barcelona scene and relax for about a week and wow and I in love with this place.",

Afraid my identity will get stolen, especially with international travel.\n\nI guess it\u2019s necessary to validate your id with the police, but what\u2019s my guarantee that the information isn\u2019t used to scam me later?",

(Others, like a state card, driver's license or a voter's ID, is not an acceptable form of identification.\n\nThis happened to me in Croatia, but apparently you can register yourself at the tourist office if you don't want to give the host your passport details. You do have to accomplish this within the first two days of arriving. Maybe you can do the same thing in Italy.",

So I believe that you are within your rights to refuse but then you would need to go to register yourself every time you change accommodation. I wouldn\u2019t worry, it is standard practice. I never had my identity stolen and I have let countless hotels copy my passport.",

I mean they ask, but I don't feel like you can say no, and I've seen this come up on here before and I've discussed it with fellow travelers. \n\nConsensus has always been, we've all heard the never allow it thing, but we've also all always been asked for it, and complied.\n\nSo that's my input, for what it's worth. \n\nAll that being said I do think I would somehow feel weird about it with an Airbnb simply because that's just some person not necessarily a business. But I think that's just me being irrational.",

Theres a bunch of scams, like people renting an airbnb for a week, setting up a mobile cryptomining rig and mine crypto at the expense of the hosts energy bill.\n\nIf you dont feel comfortable giving away your passport, they sometimes take drivers licenses or a Personal ID card(some countries issue those).

    "postText": "Where do you keep your back up cash/card/important belongings? I recently had about $500USD stolen in the form of cash and an emergency debit card out of my bag which was in a locked cabinet supplied by the hostel (my own lock though). I understand you're responsible for your own stuff but when I raised it with the owner he said \"you should always have your important things on your person\".\n\nI argued I'd rather not be carrying around all of my cash (I'm in Argentina where cash is required in a lot of places), emergency cards, passport, etc everytime I go out but he said I should, which honestly made me more annoyed than the stuff getting stolen given he'd provided sub par storage facilities.\n\nDo you have a back up way to keep things like cash/passports/etc secure on top of a locker? I still am not in love with the idea of taking anything I consider valuable with me throughout the day.",

It might sound gross but they aren't going to rake through piles of dirty underwear, they will be looking for loose items or bags. I don't generally trust hostel lockers any more than I trust leaving things on display in the room. In fact I feel my items are less secure in the locker than hidden in the suitcase because thieves are more likely to assume your valuables are in the locker.\n\nA money belt is usually my go to for valuables in countries where pick pockets and robberies are a common threat. But I don't like the feel of a money belt around my waist so I may look for a better solution for future trips. My backpack has a nice hidden compartment on the back of it but that's not much use if your bag gets stolen. Still, it's safer than storing anything in a zipped side pocked as a common scam in some destinations is to distract a tourist whilst their friend carefully unzips your bag. I almost fell victim to that in Berlin in broad daylight. I got a better backpack after that trip.",

I try to have $100 in cash max at any point in time, $50 on me and $50 in my hostel bag.

If one bank gets compromised you want clean access elsewhere.\n\nI also don\u2019t carry my passport on me which people will differ in opinion on but I think the odds of something happening to it out and about are higher than behind a lock, which wouldn\u2019t have been true for you.

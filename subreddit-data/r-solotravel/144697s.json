Like a few of us, he's the one who inspired me to see the world through food, and this was a tribute I never posted five years ago:\n\nLet's raise our glass to Anthony Bourdain, a man who inspired a whole generation to embrace other cultures through street food. Wherever he is right now, pretty sure he is in an alleyway hole-in-a-wall, sharing jokes with the locals while cracking a cold one. Rest in Parts Unknown!",

Another good demo of his depth is his [Travel as a Political Act](https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/video/travel-talks/political-act). He\u2019s very self-aware. Those are both like a decade old so keep that in mind, but I didn\u2019t discover them until 2019 or 2020- still the Before Times but ya know lol.\n\nI grew up watching Rick Steves\u2019 shows in the 90s and I fully credit him with igniting my interest in travel and curiosity about the world, so it was cool to rediscover him &amp; his work like two decades later!\n\nAs for Anthony Bourdain, that man was\u2026 **the man**. His explorations of cultures &amp; humanity as a whole coupled with his insights, wit, and humor are unmatched afaik. Some of his content I\u2019ve rewatched numerous times, but I\u2019ve been working slowly through it so I can still savor new-to-me content even 5 years later. I\u2019m glad and grateful that he gave us what he did, even as I long for what more he had in him.",

I was trying to figure out how to go to college despite my families\u2019 best efforts to keep me from going. I had never heard of Anthony Bourdain and frankly I hated food shows but he was *so* *different* . I watched him slurp down something in some country I can\u2019t even remember the name of now with people who didn\u2019t speak his language and it looked like he was having the time of his life. It was the antithesis of the American notion that we live in the best country on earth so why leave? I decided then and there I wanted to travel and I met a woman who was equally inspired by him and we ended up traveling the world together. When I found out he passed I was beyond devastated. I think those who were fans of his mourned his death in a way not commonly seen.",

I\u2019ve always felt that people don\u2019t kill themselves because they don\u2019t want to live, but because they are so fucking tired of fighting. \n\nAs one who has struggled against depression for my entire life, especially in 2018, his death hurt quite a lot.  As did Robin Williams\u2019, as did Scott Hutchinson\u2019s (lead singer of my favorite band, Frightened Rabbit). But I like to believe that it provided a little reminder that depression is a life-long battle, and that even the most vibrant, successful people can succumb, and I hope it thereby led to a little more compassion in the world.",

Still trying to find any other travel shows/vloggers similar to him but nobody really comes close, imo.\n\nIf you haven't read them, I recommend his books. Additionally, he narrates some of them as audiobooks and hearing his voice retell some of those stories helps capture the feelings I have when watching his shows.",

            "comment": "When Bourdain died, I was just about to turn 18, I knew I liked travel but I hadn't started seeing the world for myself yet. I'm sorry to say his death didn't really impact me that much at the time. I knew who he was, I had seen an episode or two of Parts Unknown, but beyond that I didn't really care.\n\nThe years since have been turbulent for me. I've had a lot of questions about the direction my life is headed; what I want to be, what I plan to do. My only goal has been travel, seeing the world, trying new things, learning about new places.\n\nAnd so a few years ago I finally started watching Parts Unknown.\n\nFor me, it was the perfect show. It wasn't *really* a food show, was it? The food was there, but it was political; it was social commentary; it was Tony using this really accessible and enjoyable format of a food/travel show to bring the audience into a culture they probably knew nothing about.\n\nAnd it was beautiful. Every episode was something unique, full of reference to movies, and books, and different stylistic choices, and colors. Nothing on television has ever come close to equaling it, and may not ever.\n\nFinding that series, and studying it and trying to learn from it, has given me my direction in life. I'm now pursuing filmmaking as a career, and my only hope is that I can get remotely close to accomplishing what he did; combining food, travel, and politics, and each episode, exposing audiences to a new world unlike anything they've ever known.\n\nMy favorite episode is probably one of the most controversial ones. Parts Unknown in Hong Kong, in which he partnered with Christopher Doyle as his Director of Photography. That had everything; beautiful cinematography straight out of a Wong Kar-Wai film, incredible food, and telling the story of an old way of life in Hong Kong that's disappearing, and soon to be gone forever.\n\nHistory will remember Tony. But more importantly than that, I think history will remember moments in time, in places most people otherwise don't give a shit about, because he went there, and documented it, and talked about it, in a format that was more compelling and engaging than a two minute newsreel.",

But it had, it cut me like no loss ever had before. I don\u2019t remember if it took weeks or months for the grief to turn to anger and then later fear, everything I wanted in life, he had, less fame of course and I didn\u2019t give a shit about that part. I was on my way, after some really fucked up years, I had gotten to a place where I could travel all over the world, buy one way tickets, get lost and end up wandering cacao farms barefoot in Santo Domingo Ecuador with the family of a taxi driver I befriended in another city. I was on my way to living out this dream and what did it mean, if that failed to make his life worth living, would it fail to make mine worth living? I don\u2019t even know how to explain it.",

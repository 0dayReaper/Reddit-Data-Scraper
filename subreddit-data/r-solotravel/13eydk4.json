But it really depends on the hotel and surrounding area. Assuming room cleaning is the same if a single person stays in a double/queen/king room (which I think it is\u2026a bed is a bed) but double occupancy would mean twice as many amenities for example, so they would charge more for 2 people. On the other hand it also means that if one goes solo the hotel gets half as much in extras such as breakfasts, cocktails, lunches and dinners, so they would charge a little more for single occupancy. So it really depends on what the hotel offers, if its all inclusive, and if there isn\u2019t anything else around. If they are the only one and it\u2019s a small hotel with few rooms their chances that guests stay in and consume their drinks, food etc and pay each time is higher so they would naturally prefer having 2 people in a room which is already built to host 2 people instead of a single person\n\nEdit: again, you\u2019re also right. I have seen it go both ways. But as a solo traveler anecdotally I feel like I have \u201coverpaid\u201d more times than the times I got a discount",

I'm 21, soon to be 22, and I can't stop feeling like I'm wasting my life. I had so many plans, to go to SEA, to go Australia for uni and all of that is dashed by this stupid virus. I know that my problem comes from a place of great privilege, but I can't help but feel like I'm missing out on having great adventures. Obviously I will one day get out there, but I feel that will be at the expense of my career. Is there anything I can do that can help me in this regard?",

It's up to you to find the meaning you're looking for, in everyday life.\n\nI know that sounds super cliche, but sometimes that corny shit is just a fact of life.  \n\n\nCOVID fucked us all.   \nI had plans to go to Greece, with my GF, in March.  \nNow I have no plans and no Gf lmao.  \nThings change, you're young as fuck dude.  \nI'm 28 and I'm just now getting my life in place.  \nStop being so hard on yourself.",

Only then, can you start living. Only then, will always be better. Only then, I'll have X, Y, and Z. It's never *now*. This movie does an excellent job of exposing that idea. I don't know where that belief is instilled: societally - congenitally - parentally? But it blocks full enjoyment, appreciation, and understanding of what life actually is: what is happening right now. \n\nA chord that struck me years ago and allowed me to completely reevaluate my travels and other pursuits was this: \"there is no geographical solution to a spiritual problem.\" One need only go further to say this and summarize much of the human experience: \"there is no external solution to an internal problem.\" No matter how many trips, jobs, relationships, marriages, drugs, children etc. you attempt to use to fill the hole in your soul (or identity for the more literal), you will never be fully satisfied until you repair the relationship within yourself. What vehicle you use to reach that place is dependent on you.  I know that solo travel is one of these vehicles for me, it is a great tool for growth if you allow it to be. However, it is only the impetus, not the answer. The answer is what you make actionable from it.\n\nAlong with travel, I have found that a spiritual process, meditative practice in my case among other things, finally helped me understand and live symbiotically with the world, instead of in opposition to it. Whatever allows us to recognize we are complete as is and allows us to do things in life joyfully and less proof driven, there is nothing to prove - that is an issue of perception, can be a vehicle.\n\nThis may not be groundbreaking for some of you, but it was a wake up call for me. My 20s were a journey toward making this discovery. I'm grateful for them now and how they got me here but my perception, my fear of \"missing out\" and \"feeling cheated\", much of what I feel and relate to in the OP, obstructed my enjoyment of life for many years. Be here now. \n\nOne of the books that changed my life I'd recommend to everyone is *The Power of Now* by Eckhart Tolle for anyone interested. Especially in these times, it can provide excellent perspective and enable one to live a deeper, more meaningful life. I know it has for me.\n\nEDIT: incomplete sentence and formatting",

At the time, I was bored with college and had no motivation or direction in my life. \n\n\nThe months I spent planning the trip gave me so much excitement and rejuvenation, despite friends and family trying to discourage me. I exhausted my life savings of $4,000 to fund the trip, and it was easily one of the best decisions I ever made in my life. \n\n\nIn my town in Ohio, ***nobody*** ever talked about solo travel, especially to Europe. Hell, none of my friends even had a passport. It was such a foreign concept at the time. I had seen a Rick Steves show on PBS, and I thought \"why not?\"\n\n\nIt changed everything. I learned that there is such a big world out there, with new people and new experiences. I learned that Americans eat shit and call it food. I learned that beer shouldn't have Lite in it's name, and wine should never be kiwi flavored. \n\n\nI got home after visiting 7 countries in 3 months, finished college and in the years since I've always planned a few international trips into my annual budget. I love the preparation and excitement that comes from travel, and I love the challenge. \n\n\nMany of my friends from college still have never owned a passport, and consider Myrtle Beach to be \"exotic\" travel.",

I didn't get to travel much because I was in university and didn't have the money or time. Sadly, I spent all my early 20s in university, graduating late at 23. Last year, I decided to move to Hong Kong to teach English for a couple of years and hopefully have the opportunity to travel all around Asia. I had so many trips already planned, some even booked. I was in Hong Kong for 3 months before I had to go back home due to the virus... So yeah, it sucks. \n\nI'm dealing with it by trying to rationalise to myself that your life doesn't stop once you hit 30. I don't need to subscribe by society's expectations - where you have fun and travel in your 20s, then settle down and have a family in your 30s. I have the rest of my life to travel the world. It may be at the sacrifice of following a traditional life path (career, house, kids, etc.) but I don't really care about that because it's my life and I want to spend it learning and experiencing as much as I can about the world.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm trying to make the most of being stuck in my country. I just moved to a new  city and I'm having fun exploring it. I'm also planning for the future and thinking of how I can fit travel around my life goals. I'm going back to university this year, so maybe I'll do an exchange overseas once things go back to normal. And after university, I may even move overseas again.",

My advice / experience is to flip the narrative - it sounds like travel and career are both important to you, so what can you do for the next 2 years that will advance your overall plans?\n\nI didn\u2019t really travel much until my late 20s, by which time I had established a career. That gave me way more money to travel with, and way more stability when I came home - because I had networks to help find me work. In my case, I gave myself 3 years to get estabkished before I took off for Europe.\n\nNot that it\u2019s an either/or choice, but worth noting also that I\u2019ve found travel in my 30s to be way better than the travel I did when I turned 18 and through my 20s. I have the money now to see the sights, stay in the style I want (still not 5 star, but no more shared bathrooms!), and so on. That\u2019s not a reason not to travel in your 20s, just some help to not feel bad about the delay.\n\nAnd unless your ambition in life is to \u201cmake the most amount of money\u201d (ie, how boring people keep score), then remember to prioritise travel as part of your career plans. Absolutely, I could be earning more money if I was happy doing a 9-5 job in a big corporation; but I chose a different path that (when the world reopens) allows heaps more travel than almost anyone else I know. And that\u2019s with a kid!",

So, I said fuck that and started focusing on what I could do to get rid of this feeling - saving for plane tickets, doing random road trips, going out with friends, etc. If I thought \u201chey, that\u2019s be cool\u201d I\u2019d try and see what I could do to make said cool thing happen. Life\u2019s boring if you let it be boring.  \n\nAlso, stress comes from focusing on the future - shit that hasn\u2019t even happened yet - so just chill out man. Think of all the money you\u2019re saving from not going out rn. You can use that for future adventures. \n\nI grew up poor as shit but I\u2019ve traveled/done random shit aka \u201cadventures\u201d a lot bc I\u2019ve made a conscious effort to do it. I get that everyone\u2019s situation is different but if you reaaaally wanna do something you\u2019ll figure out how to get the time and money to do it.",

Had a post grad job offer that was recinded due to covid. Didn\u2019t have a graduation or any celebration after spending 6 years in university. \n\nThe lesson I learned (and how I stayed sane lol) is that life will throw things at you that will change your plans. Covid is just one thing, but as you get older you will learn that almost nothing goes to plan. And that\u2019s ok. Focus on what you can do right now. I work and moved in with my parents which has allowed me to save a lot more money for my future travels. I started working out every day because of all the time I have, picked up some new hobbies, started reading more and gaining knowledge. \n\nAll I want to say is that you can use this time as an opportunity to do things you\u2019ve never had time to do. Life may be on \u201cpause\u201d but you don\u2019t have to be. Prepare ahead, save up money, get healthier and more fit, gain some knowledge and study for your future at university. The present moment is not so bad. \n\n\nIt\u2019s ok and normal to be sad about what you could have been doing. But life has a way of thwarting our plans (accidents, sickness, family, etc.). Just don\u2019t think of this time as wasted, use it to prepare for the future",

It's really interesting looking back and tracing my path to figure out how I got to where I am now, while also knowing that I couldn't have even imagined where I'd be by now when I was your age. I had no idea what adventures I'd go on, how my day-to-day life would evolve, what cities I'd live in, the jobs I'd have, or how often my life plan would change. I also couldn't anticipate the darker times in my life, where I did feel like I was completely wasting my life. The older you get, the more palpably you feel the natural ebb and flow of life and gain the perspective that you can make it through the shitty times and come out on the other side for the better for it.\n\nRegarding your career: you will figure it out. I promise. It doesn't have to look like what everyone else's does and your timing may not be the same as your peers. That's OK. It took me 4 years after graduating from college to land a full-time job in my field, but I'm so thankful for the time I spent doing other things. I think it's made me more open to the fact that my career doesn't have to be just one thing over the course of my life. As for something tangible you can do right now, try seeing if there are any free online courses you can take that are related to your potential career field, or even just something else you are interested in. Stay curious and try to keep learning.\n\nOne of the best things about solo travel is the freedom that comes with that. One of the more challenging things is that it doesn't always go according to plan. Learning to pivot, take risks, and embrace all the weird parts of traveling alone one of the things that makes it so worthwhile. You learn to rely on yourself in ways you couldn't have imagined. Even though you can't travel right now, I would encourage you to try and channel that spirit in your everyday life too. Be open to possibilities, but know that not everything works out and you'll have to figure something else out. Trust your gut. Take risks. \n\nI know it is hard to feel like you are missing out right now. But I also know you'll have adventures in front of you that you can't even imagine right now. Your early 20s are just the beginning, I promise.",

It was always a dream of mine to go in my 20\u2019s and I never really prioritized it until 2019. \n\nThe fact of the matter is you aren\u2019t going to go right now. I\u2019ve honestly pushed it away from my mind as a priority again because I know it won\u2019t happen. Find something else to dedicate that energy toward, relevant or not. \n\nGet in shape! You will be on a beach in Bali or Thailand etc down the road when we can all get our shit together, it\u2019s going to be much nicer if you are in shape (not just to look good but to explore the country!)\n\nFind ways to make money and slowly put a bit of money aside for your travels and when you go you can live like a king! \n\nIf you want to travel and work, work towards a career that allows that! Or work towards one with good PTO and vacation. \n\nExplore where you are. I can\u2019t tell you the amount of hikes, tourist attractions, national parks etc I haven\u2019t been to around my area. Do what you would do if you were perpetually visiting somewhere! \n\nYou aren\u2019t alone, hang in there and keep working towards a better future for yourself now",

You are already putting yourself in a bad position and establishing potentially unrealistic expectations by saying \"Obviously will one day get out there.\" The reality of what COVID revealed is that, firstly, life is inherently unpredictable and, secondly, the habits which have been formed during the last one hundred years of globalization are potentially unsustainable and even unnatural. You cite your desire to travel with seemingly little regard for the fact that, up until the past century, traveling as a hobby was virtually unheard of. I understand your desires and goals, as they are those which our society has conditioned you toward and which you rightfully aspire to, but I suggest you consider the cost of what those habits entails. The reality is that humanity finds itself in a precarious situation at this moment and we as a species are not exactly dealing with it. I think you should view this entire situation more holistically, and recognize that the world is changing in ways that were necessitated by decades of irresponsible practices, which we still are not addressing. This is all to say, I think you should find meaning and purpose in things which are more certain and stable - say, reading or philosophy - and recognize that your desires for exotic experiences and real world adventures has been potentially sacrificed by the recklessness of our forebears.",

Of course, I have plans for what I want to see when it's safe to travel again. But there is so much more to life than travel.\n\nMaybe you can spend some time learning more about the history and culture of a place you really want to visit while you wait. But you can also do a lot more from where you are - you can find a penpal, volunteer in a safe way, read. I find that sometimes the experience of talking to someone new and different from me (again, safely and either outside or virtually) can be just as perspective-changing as travel. Or maybe there are some people you haven't heard from in a while whom you'd like to get back in touch with. \n\nThese are all experiences that could give you something like what you would experience in traveling to a new, interesting place. You just have to allow yourself to see them that way. When your experience of where you are becomes richer, imagine how rich the experience of an unfamiliar place could be.",

Found out you guys can do a year abroad for dirt cheap highly suggest doing that in your case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd the answer to your question is yes. I turned 29 and feel like I haven't done what all I wanted. But I defiantly have done a lot more then most.\n\nJoined the army, graduated as an engineer, got very high paying jobs, fired from high paying jobs, got a work trip to alaska for 3 months and explored, bought a house, moved to the west coast, loved/lost, experienced trauma/misery/pain, EU tour for 3 weeks, Latin America a few times 5 weeks total. Pilot, and I'm sure there's some other stuff I forgot but you get the idea. \n\nSometimes it's never enough, and there's going to have to be a point you'll be the only one to draw that line. \n\nWhat I suggest is you don't forgo your education so long as it is a good education that will benefit you down the line. Don't waste your money and don't pick up and bad habits. And get out the door as much as you can.",

Trust me you have lots of time to do shit! Ive spent most of my years making edm and working random jobs, such as background acting here in LA at one point working with my now ex girlfriend growing and selling weed plants to dispensaries. These are just some of my ventures. \n\nJust get out of your comfort zone, dont be afraid to fail because if you dont try you will never succeed!\n\nMost of all, realize that you will die one day and nothing will matter.\n\nMake conscious decisions based off of a clear head, calculated risks yolo once and a while, and have fun, take whatever you do to the furthest limits based on your gut feeling and how much you want to achieve!\n\nBest of luck, y\u2019all can find me on IG: 2PacsHologram",

    "postText": "Had an amazing time in Lima Peru. People told me I had to go on to see other cities and sites like Cusco and Arequipa but I decided to stay in Lima and had a blast. I was initially worried I\u2019d get lonely or bored but there wasn\u2019t a dull moment. I met some fellow travellers and enjoyed my time with them but never latched on. Lima and Peru are amazing and I\u2019m so glad I solo travelled. Could be my best trip yet. Peru and it\u2019s people will always be close to my heart.",

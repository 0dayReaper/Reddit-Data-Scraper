    "postText": "Next month, I will be traveling with my two cats in a single carrier to move from Chicago to Portland. I have already confirmed with the airline that this will be allowed, but my main worry is that I will have to carry these guys through TSA and the airport by myself. The issue with this is that neither of them like to be held, and my kitty stroller I originally planned on placing them in is too large to fit under the seat and they are sooo heavy. I plan on giving them each a dose of gabapentin so they will be sleepy, but I am worried that this will not be enough to keep me safe from their scratching and cries while I wait for their carrier to go through the scanner. I can not find a single person online with a similar experience to me and I am starting to get increasingly nervous as the date approaches. If anyone has any advice on how to make this day not a living hell, I would greatly appreciate it.",

I highly recommend getting halters for them with tags attached just in case you need to hold them you have something to hold onto. I\u2019d also suggest doing a trial run with the sedatives before your flight. One of my cats reacted very badly to it on the first flight and ripped all her claws out. The second time, I didn\u2019t give them any drugs and they did a lot better. Also if you can get the airline to allow two separate carriers, it\u2019s a lot better to have them on the plane with you vs being the cargo hold. Good luck!",

We were both red and tired carrying them - only one cat with our luggage so I don\u2019t know how you will manage that part. I didn\u2019t give my cats anything. I used a calming spray and that worked. Best of luck. Highly suggest getting a friend and having two carriers. If they can\u2019t stand up and turn around, they won\u2019t let them travel no matter what the other worker said. Plus they can\u2019t be over a certain weight.",

My cat hated her carrier and hated being held so I gave her gabapentin, and she basically slept the entire time. She was too out of it to even notice I was holding her. If your cats tolerate a harness, I would recommend putting a harness on them so you can have a hand firmly on the harness while you\u2019re holding them in case they get wiggly. Also, ask your vet for a couple extra doses of gabapentin so you can test it out on the cats before the trip and make sure they respond well to it.",

Obviously each cat is different so yours might not like them but some learn to like them after a small amount of exposure.  I just bought one for my cat to take her on walks with.  It\u2019s kind of funny, outer space looking but it gets the job done.",

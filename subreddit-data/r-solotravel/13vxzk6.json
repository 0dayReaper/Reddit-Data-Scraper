    "postText": "I spent 2 weeks traveling through Japan - Tokyo, Osaka, [Kyoto](https://postimg.cc/pyFwhGsF) and I'm writing this for those who are thinking about visiting. To preface, I did travel with a friend but spent a lot of time on my own. I'll cover as much as possible.\n\n**Pre-Trip**\n\nI booked a flight with American Airlines / Delta Airlines for $590 round-trip three months before departing. \n\nI flew out of Los Angeles to Tokyo (Haneda). The trip started on February 9 and ended on February 20. I booked my accommodation before arriving in Japan. I used Hostelworld and Agoda. More about the hostels and hotels I booked are below.\n\n\n**COVID Screening and Visa information for US Citizens only**\n\nDuring the time I visited, Japan still required visitors to be fully vaccinated and have a pre-screening for arrival. First I had to do a pre-screening for American Airlines on VeriFly (please do this a day before checking in at the airport if so). Then, save yourself time and use Visit Japan Web (http://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/) and do the pre-screening requirements a couple of days before departure. \n\nWhen you land in Tokyo, immediately after deplaning, swaths of airport personnel ask if you have the screener filled out and ready to go. If you don\u2019t, they put you to the side and ask you to fill it out using the airport\u2019s wifi. It takes time and you still have to go through customs after. \n\nVisas for US citizens is a free, 3-month visa if I recall correctly. Bring your COVID vaccination card just in case they ask for it.\n\n\n**Tech/Phone**\n\nI took my iPhone 14 Pro (unlocked) and connected buying Ubigi 10gb data plan. Do this before flying to Japan. When you land, you can activate your data plan directly on your phone. I didn\u2019t get pocket wifi as the Ubigi worked perfectly. \n\nDownload the Ubigi app. They give instructions but please follow them. \n\nApps that I used:\n\nGoogle Maps: you can download offline maps. \n\nGoogle Translate: Use this everywhere you go. You can use the camera feature and it can translate Japanese to English really great. It saved me a lot of hassle when ordering at restaurants. \n\nCurrency Converter\n\nYou might want to download a VPN if you want to use Netflix and such. Express VPN is one I\u2019d recommend. \n\n\n**Money/Currency**\n\nI took my Charles Schwab debit card and a backup Chase credit card/Chase debit card. Surprisingly, a lot of stores in Japan are cash-heavy; especially small shops and restaurants. My budget for the trip was $2000 with flights included.\n\nHostels and hotels were around $20-35 USD. Food prices were about $7-$20 a meal. It can get really expensive if you eat at fine dining restaurants. That being said, I stuck to eating mostly at hole-in-the-wall establishments where no English was spoken. Believe me when I say that the best ramen I ever had was only $7 USD. More on what restaurants I recommend are down below. If you really want to save money, don\u2019t buy alcohol.\n\nA solid budget for me was $60-$80 per day without lodging expenses. Some days, I only spent $40 which was all food (I spare no expense for food), then some days I went over because I bought cool souvenirs for myself and some excursions were pricey. You can visit Japan for less but I didn\u2019t want to money pinch myself because I was only there for 2 weeks. \n\n\n**Transportation**\n\nI love Japan for this reason. So here\u2019s my take: If you are visiting Japan for exactly 14 days; get the JR Pass on Klook. You buy this a month before departing your home country. For me, Klook delivered it about a week after I bought it over Mail. You could buy either a 7, 14, or 21-day JR pass so I would recommend planning a trip that matches these exact number of days to get the most out of your money. \n\nNow imagine you\u2019re in Japan. It is your first day officially visiting\u2026go to a JR Pass office at any major train station and ask them to redeem your pass. They will ask for the paper ticket that arrived in the mail to your home and they will ask for your passport. After they verify that it is you, they will give you a small ticket which will be your JR pass. DO NOT LOSE THIS! I believe they will not replace it. On how to use it, [check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWEYZXb8-yE&amp;t=302s&amp;ab_channel=Jake-JapanNavigator).\n\nNow to navigate, I used a combination of Google Maps and Apple Maps to get around. Use whichever one is more comfortable for you. These 2 apps are really exceptional at mapping out the best routes and the times trains depart. Note: the JR Pass only works for JR rail lines! Tokyo/Kyoto/Osaka all have their own subways and train lines with their own payment system. More on this\u2026\n\nSo the best way to get around the city is using a Suica card. These are sold virtually at any train station. If you can't find it, ask a train station attendant and say \u201cSuica?\u201d. They point you in the right direction. \n\nA Suica card can be refilled unlimited times and can be used for any rail lines (JR included, but not for Bullet Trains). It is used by tapping at the turnstiles to enter the rails and at any vending machine in Japan! Also at arcades! It is a total mindblower haha\nAlso in Tokyo, some hostels or hotels have a 3-day subway pass for cheap. \n\n\nBullet Trains - You can use the Shinkansen bullet trains if you have the JR Pass. Make an important note: You can only ride the Hikari or Sakura trains with your JR Pass. The Nozomi and Mizuho are reserved seating and cost extra because they have fewer stops. If they catch you using these rail lines, they will ask you to get off the next stop or worse, fine you and report you. To see Mount Fuji from Tokyo to Kyoto/Osaka, sit on the right side of the train (right side of the direction it is going). Use Google Maps and Apple Maps to pinpoint when to look out the window.\n\n\n**Food**\n\nI usually ate sandwiches and pastries from 7-Eleven in the morning or whenever I needed to pack a lunch. It was a great way to save cash and the food was delicious. High-quality foods and snacks. \n\nAs I said earlier, I really spare no expense for good, big meals. I save money at 7-Eleven so I can go all out for lunch and dinner. My go-to meal was usually ramen because it was so damn good. I tried a lot of foods. I\u2019ll try and remember which ones I ate:\n      - Ramen\n      - Okonomiyaki \n      - Unagi\n      - Katsu Curry\n      - Taiyaki\n      - Tempura\n      -  Japanese cheesecake\n      -  Macha ice cream\n      -  Macha waffles\n      -  Onigiri\n      -  And a lot of different ice creams, confectionary snacks\n      -  McDonald\u2019s - please try lol they have interesting combinations\n\n\n**Pack List**\n\nI used a 40-liter Osprey backpack. \n\n1 scarf \n\n1 beanie\n\n2 cotton t-shirts\n\n2 thermal polyester long-sleeve shirts (Odor resistant) \n\n2 pairs of joggers\n\n1 pair of Nike thermal leggings\n\n8 pairs of Nike Dri-Fit boxers (lost 1)\n\n4 pairs of ankle socks\n\n3 pairs of Darn Tough Merino wool blend socks (Highly recommend, Odor resistant) \n\n1 parka\n\n1 pair of Adidas Ultraboost shoes\n\n1 Hershel toiletries bag\n\n2 Forge cable combination locks \n\nExternal battery pack (13000 mAh)\n\nBose QC-25 noise-canceling headphones\n\n\nOver the course of the trip, I bought a much-needed 30L Patagonia day backpack\n\n\nI don\u2019t sweat heavily so I re-wore my shirts, the Merino wool blend socks, and joggers. I did my laundry maybe once or twice at the hostels. It was freezing at the time I went, so I usually layered up when temperatures were lower than usual. \n\n\n**Safety**\n\nI am a 6'1\" (1.85 m) male with a light brown complexion. I felt safe most of my time there. I think it was the safest country I have ever been to. Some Japanese people are known to be racist but I didn\u2019t experience it.  So I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. \n\n\n**Itinerary/Activities**\n\nFeb  9   Day 1\tTokyo\nFeb 10  Day 2\tTokyo\t\nFeb 11  Day 3\tTokyo (Day Trip to Odiaba/Yokohama)\nFeb 12  Day 4        Osaka \nFeb 13  Day 5\tOsaka (Day Trip to Hime-ji Castle/Kobe)\nFeb 14  Day 6        Osaka (Day Trip to Nara)\nFeb 15  Day 7\tKyoto\nFeb 16  Day 8\tKyoto\nFeb 17  Day 9        Kyoto\nFeb 18  Day 10      Tokyo\nFeb 19  Day 11      Tokyo\nFeb 20 Day 12       Tokyo (Fly Out)\n\n\nI will put a star (*) next to anything that I highly recommend! 2 stars are for more emphasis!

Goes without saying but please respect the local customs.\n\n2. Please learn how to say \u201cThank You\u201d in Japanese! Just learning and using \u201cArigato\u201d anywhere you go will make you seem like you care and respect everyone. Nothing was more embarrassing than watching an American say \u201cthank you\u201d to a Japanese person. \n\n3. Plan to do the major tourist attractions early in the morning. You will get nice pictures without any tourists and you\u2019ll sometimes get the whole temple complex to yourself. The staff will also be more friendly and willing to chat with you. I usually aim to be at temples around 7:00 when they open.\n\n3. Use Google Translate for everything! You can have full conversations with friendly Japanese people when using the conversation feature on the app! Use the camera feature to translate Kanji at restaurants that do not offer an English menu. \n\n4. Get a Ubigi data plan, I bought 10GB and it had good service anywhere I went. Get more GB if you plan on staying longer. \n\n5. I ate at 7-Eleven most of the time when I was too lazy or tired to go out. The 7-Elevens here in Japan are nothing like the ones in the US. Expect to find high-quality sandwiches, Onigiri, and more Japanese snacks. \n6. Shop at supermarkets near the end of the day (1 hour before closing) and they usually mark down prepped meals half-off or at a discounted price! If you really on a budget, this can help you to save a ton of money and still get a taste of the local cuisine.\n\n7. If you need to buy random stuff like clothes, bags, or toiletries; go shop at any Don Quijote or Tokyu Hands department store. They have other shops too that are great to find cool stuff. \n\n8. Use Google Translate to translate English to Kanji (Japanese) and use Kanji to find restaurants that are hidden because they don\u2019t use English words. For example, if you want to find the best ramen place, search \u201c\u62c9\u9eba\u201d and you\u2019ll find hidden gems with 5-star reviews!\n9. The best souvenir I brought back myself was a Goshuincho. These are \u201chonorable stamp/seal book\u201d used by people visiting shrines or temples. If you want more info, google this! I highly recommend doing this!\n\n\nIf you have any questions, comment below or send a DM. Peace!",

            "comment": "As someone who's been living in Japan for nearly 4 years this itinerary looks pretty throrough, although I highly recommend heading up north to Nagano, Aomori, or Sendai if you're a nature lover. The Japanese Alps are insanely beautiful and you won't regret it! I also recommend spending at least one night in a traditional ryokan with onsen and breakfast. It's a bit of a splurge, but an experience you won't find in most other parts of the world. \n\nJapan etiquette tips!\n\n1. On escalators, walk on the right, stand on the left (in Osaka it's flipped). I can't emphasize this enough.\n2. For trains: Don't use local trains between 6:30-9:00 and 17:30-19:00. I'm sure many people have heard about the crazy rush hour trains in Tokyo, and they are indeed insane. I get squished against the door every morning and you definitely don't want to experience that especially if you've got luggage with you.\n3. Excuse me = Sumimasen. If you accidentally bump into somebody, need to get past someone, get someone's attention, etc. it works for everything.\n4. Restaurant/izakaya: If you go to a smaller restaurant or pub (not a chain or fancy place) then you can use \"sumimasen\" to get the server's attention (just don't be too loud or aggressive, it takes some practice to get it right). Otherwise, just make eye contact with the server and raise your hand. This works too for those who are uncomfortable shouting out. The server will not come to your table to check up on you so you have to get their attention somehow",

I bought a goshuincho and he selected it. He gave me this paper and asked to write what I wished for. I wrote a phrase in Kanji that illustrated what I wished for. He seemed happy that I went the extra step to write in Kanji. Plus that was the first time I experience snowfall outside and I had the complex to myself.\n\n2. A ramen shop in Yokohama. The couple who owned and ran it were the sweetest duo. They were very friendly and surprised to see a foreigner stop by. And the ramen was on point!\n\n3. Seeing the Tokyo skyline from Shibuya Sky at night. It was the last thing I did before I left the next day. It was the perfect ending.\n\nThere are tons of memories I have but these are the ones that I can remember. I can\u2019t rank them haha",

    "postText": "I am looking to travel for about a week to Luxembourg and the wine country around the Mosel Valley in western Germany. I\u2019ll start near Kaiserslautern on May 23, and need to end up in Heidelberg on May 29.\n\n\r  \nI don\u2019t have a car and am planning on taking trains and other public transit. I was thinking of something like 2-3 days in Luxembourg, then spending the rest of the time in some combination of Trier, Cochem, or a small town with wineries. I\u2019m interested in wineries of course, good restaurants, and scenic areas with outdoor activities.\n\n\r  \nDoes anyone have specific cities or towns they particularly liked? Any wineries that are particularly good? Also, how is public transit in the area as far as reaching more remote areas?\n\n\r  \nThanks for any replies!",

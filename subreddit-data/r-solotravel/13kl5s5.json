    "postText": "I heard about hostels and I initially didn't check them out on Booking or Trivago, but I read a few comments here saying they're \"pretty good,\" so I want to understand more. \n\nFor context, I've been solo traveling for a little over 6 years and I've always rented a small private space, whether in Japan, Australia, or the Philippines. I'm a 33 year old male.\n\nHowever, my 29-day itinerary across Western Europe this October has got me thinking about money more than ever, mainly because it would be my longest time mostly in tour mode (I say mostly because I always bring a laptop with me for a few hours freelance work). \n\nNow for the wave of questions:\n\nAre hostels like capsule hotels in Japan? How much privacy should I expect? \n\nWhat amenities do they often offer? \n\nWhat are some tips for a first timer? \n\nWhat should I be looking for if I were to also work on the side other than wifi? \n\nAre they all usually filled? \n\nI'll be carrying a backpack and wheeled luggage. Do they have big lockers? \n\nPS I saw this cool-looking hostel called Bee Hostel in Amsterdam and it looks nice. I was wondering if this is a good standard for hostels or if it's an outlier.",

            "comment": "&gt; Are hostels like capsule hotels in Japan? How much privacy should I expect? \n\nNo. Dorms will vary, some places have more privacy than others with curtains around the beds, but a dorm is still a dorm, you don't have your own place. You can check the pictures of the dorms on booking / hostelworld to get an idea.\n\n&gt; What amenities do they often offer? \n\nSome have towels for free, some have them for rent. Some will have soap and others won't. Some will have free coffee or breakfast, some will have nothing. Expect to need your own stuff\n\n&gt; What are some tips for a first timer? \n\nIt's sleeping in a dorm with strangers. Pack light as there often isn't much space for luggage, and have stuff you need at night + stuff you might want to put in a locker easily accessible. Earplugs are invaluable.\n\n&gt; What should I be looking for if I were to also work on the side other than wifi? \n\nLook at what type of common space they have - I'm assuming you'd want a table and chair ? Also read comments to get an idea of the type of atmosphere, you might want to book more quiet places. If you need to make work calls you might want to look up coworking space outside of the hostel as you won't have a place to yourself.\n\n&gt; Are they all usually filled? \n\nDepends on the place and the time of year\n\n&gt; I'll be carrying a backpack and wheeled luggage. Do they have big lockers? \n\nIn my experience, a day bag will fit in most lockers but a wheeled luggage won't. I just put my valuables in the locker and lock my bigger backpack if it doesn't fit in there.\n\n&gt; PS I saw this cool-looking hostel called Bee Hostel in Amsterdam and it looks nice. I was wondering if this is a good standard for hostels or if it's an outlier.\n\nHonestly there are a lot of nice hostels if you look in advance and pay a little more than minimum price. Always read the latest comments on booking / hostelworld and on Google maps",

            "comment": "Most hostel are just rooms filled with two floor beds. In cities they are often in old buildings and that is very obvious. In the latest years I have seen more modern looking hostels, but the other type are still the norm.\n\nLuggage is mostly places under or next to beds. Lockers are small and you often have to bring your own lock. I always had two types, since often your lock does not even fit.\n\nSome places are very noisy, others are better. It also depends on the people that happen to be there. In summer there will be much more people than in winter, although in tourist hotspots hostels might be filled all the time. Some places are clean enough, others can be pretty dirty or even disgusting.\n\nSo I\u00b4d so your experience may vary. My advice is never to book too many nights in advance, to stay flexible.",

            "comment": "I mostly stay in country hostels but I have seen lockers in only one city hostel (jacobs inn dublin). \n\nDo your research if you want locks (I recommend lock picking lawyer), many will be useless beyond flagging valuables. This being said, I've never had issues without locks or lockers, just don't leave your valuables lying around.\n\nYou may be able to work in your room, common room or kitchen if you just need a table and chair. You may get quiet, but don't expect it. Cleaning usually goes on when most ppl are out. Consider a library if that is what you want.\n\nThe cowshed in Uig and jacobs inn in dublin look a lot like the bee hostel, otherwise it is mostly bunkbeds in my experience. A large thin scarf can give some privacy on bottom bunks tho, eaeplugs are also a must in my experience.\n\nWhile hostels can be great fun social or cheap places, some are barely cheaper or even more expensive than hotels these days which may suit you better on freelance days.",

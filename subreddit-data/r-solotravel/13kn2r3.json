    "postText": "I have next week off work, and really want to go on a little spontaneous adventure.  This is a general itinerary I have in mind based off what I've been able to research.  A couple open spots I\"m hoping for some help to fill.\n\n\\*\\*Some slight concerns are whether the trip length is too short.. anticipating any potential flight delays, altitude sickness- road travel etc.  Assuming I'll have a couple days of just trying to relax, people watch, and see what comes my way, I'm not one too jam pack my days when I travel. Ideally I'd have more time but you gotta take what you get.\n\nWill I be able to book things more spur of the moment at this time?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSunday -Day 1 - Arrive in Lima - half day - fly to Cusco that evening.\n\nDay 2 - take it easy in Cusco and see how the altitude affects me. \\*Thinking I'd maybe try to grab some sort of altitude pills in anticipation of this.\n\nDay 3 - See how I'm feeling and hang out in Cusco another day\n\nDay 4 -  Check out MP - spend the night back in Cusco\n\nDay - 5 ??   I really want to see jungle.  Also, from reading, Sacred Valley seems to be a good choice.\n\nDay - 6 ??\n\nDay - 7  Fly back home",

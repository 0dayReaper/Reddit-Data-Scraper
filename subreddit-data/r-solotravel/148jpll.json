    "postText": "I'd like to go to Italy soon, and to make it more affordable and exciting I'm thinking of hitchhiking (and couchsurfing).\n\nDoes anyone have experience with hitchhiking in Italy? Would you recommend it, or not? Are there certain areas where I shouldn't do it? Things to be careful of specifically in Italy (other than the basics you need to keep in mind when hitchhiking in general)?\n\nThis may sound rude, but I'm looking for information from people who actually KNOW something about this, and not for horror stories from people who have zero experience with hitchhiking and have never been to Italy. Thank you \ud83e\udd17.",

I opted to just take established transit after that experience.\n\nIf I were a dude or much more masculine presenting, I might have given it another shot after that. There are some websites for finding ride shares - people heading to a particular city who'll take passengers if you chip in a few euros for gas. That could be a better option for you.",

I'm on the couchsurfing platform, and tend to go with people who have (many) good reviews. I have declined offers if the vibe felt off, or a person didn't have reviews yet. I also check the location before I go somewhere, and check if there's a hostel nearby as a backup option if necessary. If I get even the smallest weird vibes, I don't stay. When it works out, it's a great way to meet local people and get good tips on what to see, and I save money in the process.\n\nAs to hitchhiking; it's also a great way to meet locals and I've had some pretty nice chats with people. And I do like the thrill a bit as well. Here too I do try to make it as safe as possible. I don't get into someone's car if it feels slightly off and make sure I have some sentences ready that I can use in case I want to politely decline (usually I thank them and say I only get into cars if there's another woman present).\n\nI know that something could still happen, but for some reason I feel quite safe. I share my live location with a friend, send the license plate number, and describe the car and the driver. I often take a photo of the car + license plate and send it, without hiding this from the driver. If they ask about it, I tell them that I always do this as a standard safety measure. If they'd even reply slightly offended or weird, I decline the ride. I feel that many people think hitchhiking is almost a guaranteed way to get kidnapped/raped/killed, but my experience is different. There are so many friendly and welcoming people out there. \n\nAs for Italy; prices have gone up so much since covid. If I only use paid transport and accommodation, I won't be able to spend a lot of time there. So hitchhiking and couchsurfing would be a great way to see and do more.",

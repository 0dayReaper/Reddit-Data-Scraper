    "postText": "Hi guys! I have a question regarding Parisian night-life as a solo traveller.\n\nI(m22, korean) started my first solo travelling two weeks ago in London. London was fine as I made friends at the hostel and I obviously speak english. I made lots of friends through my hostel and also hung out with locals. At least in london, everyone is just chill with a beer.\n\nBut in Paris it is very difficult to find a place to go to  and if I walk into a place idk what im doing in there.\nAs of writing this, i am awkwardly sitting in a random Paris bar/club and made zero friends. Is it ok to walk up to people and be friendly in english? My french is terrible, so that is hopeless.\n\nI really want to hang out with people around my age that i can connect with!\n\nAre there any student's bars or other solo travellers bars in paris? If so, I'd love your ecommendations.\n\nPlus, any kind of bar/club etiquette for Paris would be greatly appreciated!! \n\nIll be in Berlin and Munich next weeks, hopefully they go better.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your helpful ideas and comments! I'll be leaving Paris soon, and i have been following a brutal museum tour schedule. So unfortunately, I'm very tired and won't be able to follow your suggestions.\n\n But I will definitely try it all out next time, especially bar hopping tours!",

Parisians do appreciate an attempt to start a conversation in French, but will switch to English pretty quickly in my experience.",

Once I shifted toward self reliance and satisfaction, I was much happier though as a solo woman I mostly focused on tiring myself out with museums and walking home after a long day around 8pm with a fresh baguette in my bag and a fancy bottle of wine and some ham and cheese and chocolate from a grocery. Usually in bed earlyish but better than looking desperate to locals. One day I'll coordinate with family or friends to enjoy the nightlife but it is what it is. Adapt to the place.",

I attended things like \"Club Polyglotte\" to practice speaking other languages ... and the point of polyglot events is to speak to strangers in foreign languages (such as English), so some socialising is unavoidable. In fact, I'd suggest seeking out polyglot clubs in any foreign city you visit, because those there can often help you navigate the place, both geographically and culturally.\n\nI'm also into poetry, so I used to go English language open mic events. There are currently two a week, \"Spoken Word Paris\" and \"Paris Lit Up\".\n\nThe thing about Paris is the locals want you to try and speak a little French. In French terms, it's elementary politeness. Once you do so, it'll break the ice: they'll often smile and switch to English. So practice a few words like Bonjour, S'il vous plait, Merci and so on; it'll be a good start.",

You get access to groupchats of the city/hostel you\u2019re in and you can also join groupchats with people who want to do similar things (sightseeing, nightlife, foodies, etc.). I strongly recommend it for your stops in Europe! And as someone else commented, st-Christopher in Paris makes it super easy to meet other people who speak english! :) good luck and have fun!",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI got sick while traveling: I feel fatigued, have a stuffed nose, headache, coughs, cramps and have been getting up multiple times in the nights to use the bathroom (I don\u2019t drink much water before bed). I came in contact with a girl who had got an infection, she ended up going to the hospital because her kidney was failing. She is okay now, but I\u2019m worried that I might have got something from her. Currently in Central America. How do I go about finding a doctor?",

Most insurance providers have a 24-hour number you can call to get a referral to English-speaking doctors or clinics in your area.\n\nYou can also try asking at the front desk of your hotel or hostel; they should be able to direct you to the right place and call you a taxi or driver to take you there.",

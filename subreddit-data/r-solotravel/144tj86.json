    "postText": "So I'm just about to complete my first 10 day holiday with the new Osprey porter 30l and I thought I'd write a review .\nThis is my first Osprey. I purchased the porter  30l as the 45l was too big and love the organisation and compression over the Fairview. \nSome things I absolutely love about the bag and some things I didn't.\n\nFor reference I'm a 171 cm female medium build. My trip has been in Japan. \n\nThings I loved\n* the organisation\n* The many pockets \n*Laptop sleeve at the back \n*The adjustable straps \n*I loved the front compression I put a bag with my airport pillow rand rain coat in there\n* The hide away straps are good just wish they were a little easier to hide away and retrieve \n* The bag fitted on the bag rails on the Japan trains \n\nThings I didn't like\n*Although the 45l was too big I would have loved to this to be 35l although I'm sure I would still have over packed it. \n* It's not waterproof and there no rain cover hidden away - my stuff got wet \n* It actually wasn't that comfortable to carry\n--First the hip belt sat above my hips \n --I had about 7 kgs in it. Fully packed so I wonder what it'd be like with less stuff in it ?",

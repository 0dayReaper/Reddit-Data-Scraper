    "postText": "I take regular monthly antidepressants and in most cases, countries will allow up to a months supply. That said, I want to do 1+ month solo travel in the future, so I was just wondering if that would be possible with a prescription or not. For reference, I\u2019m currently on Prozac (fluoxetine), I know this isn\u2019t sold domestically in some countries like Japan or Italy but I\u2019m not about anywhere else.",

I think unless you're travelling with really serious medication or it actually looks like you're trying to smuggle stuff they don't usually care.\n\n\nAlso just btw Fluoxetine is sold in Italy (just per prescription as well of course).",

Germany, Taiwan, US, Russia, China are the main customs enforcers by reputation. Germany does not make enforcement exceptions. Whatever the maximum penalty is for the crime is your penalty for getting caught. Taiwan has a strict agricultural inspection. Taiwan isn\u2019t worried about the medication as much as a fungus on the medication that could bring an evasive species onto the island. Russian customs is corrupt. There are lots of rules and customs may ask you to pay a fee for exemption to those rules. There will be no receipt for those fees. China and the US have strict policies for any possible narcotics through customs. Chinese customs also knows most violations are prescription opioids legitimate in other countries but not permitted to be brought into China. And the US has the largest customs enforcement budget in the world and a department that needs to justify that bloated budget.\n\nSource: i used to work for federal inspection services and process detainees/deportees.",

My case was even crazier, where I was going to teach English in China for a year and knew I wouldn't reliably be able to get my 2/day brain med there. So I got my doctor to prescribe a full year and change fill for it. Had no issues at all - don't think anyone ever even looked at them.",

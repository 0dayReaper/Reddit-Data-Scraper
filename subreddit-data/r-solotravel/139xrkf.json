    "postText": "Hello \n\nI am planning a 7 day trip to central part of Italy in late June and I was thinking of following itinerary \n\nDay 1: land in Rome in the morning, catch the Train to Perugia, check in there and spend afternoon in the city \n\nDay 2: daytrip from Perugia to Marmore waterfalls \n\nDay 3: daytrip from Perugia to Orvietto\n\nDay 4: daytrip from Perugia to Asissi, Train to Florence in the afternoon, check into acommodation in Florence \n\nDay 5: daytrip from Florence to Siena/San Gimigano/Chianti/Pisa - organized tour although would prefer to find one without Pisa as I had been there before but it seems that all of the offered trips include Pisa as well. Also I was considering doing this trip by public transport but that way I might miss the \u201ccountryside\u201d component\n\nDay 6: Full day in Florence - this is my second visit but the first one was short so I would like to visit cathedral dome and Ufizzi museum this time ( been to Academia last time) and maybe some walking tour ( I took one last time but there are many various ones so\u2026) \n\nDay 7: free morning in Florence before taking Train at 2 pm to Rome for evening flight home \n\nIs there anything you think that should be changed or added\u2026 especially regarding trips to Marmore/Asissi/Orvietto as those seem to be small towns so maybe something interesting nearby to combine; just keep in mind that I fully depend on public transport/ guided tours so no car rental or long cycyling? \n\nAlso what is situation with tickets in Florence; I see that now you can get tickets for everything few days in advance, does it get busier in June in a way that it is necessary to Book tickets to Ufizzi and Cathedral dome more in advance?\n\nI wanted to visit Saturnia Spa but it seems lenghty to get there by public transport.\n\nAny other tips/critiques/comments will be appreciated.",

It gets very crowded and the tour of church is nothing special. You will hear all about Giotto and Cimabue and gothic art and\u2026it\u2019s a long tour of everything that looks all kind of samey. You\u2019re locked into the tour for the duration and there\u2019s nothing else in town of interest. For me it\u2019s just a little boring and not worth going out of your way for.\n\nI saw in your other post that you\u2019ve already visited Bologna and this will be new for you. If that\u2019s the case and you like churches, go for it",

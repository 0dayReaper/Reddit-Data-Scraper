    "postText": "I arrived in Kathmandu a few days ago, I\u2019m here for a few more days and then heading off on a trek. I\u2019ll then have another two weeks split between Kathmandu and Pokhara at the end of May. \n\nWhere are the best nightlife spots for meeting new people while solo here, in both Kathmandu and Pokhara?\n\nI\u2019m hoping to make some friends on my trek but I would be nice to know nonetheless. I kinda regret booking a niceish hotel for the days before I go away as it feels like it\u2019s limited how easy it is to meet new people without knowing the right spots compared to a guesthouse or a hostel.\n\nWould appreciate any suggestions! Thanks",

            "comment": "I\u2019m in Pokhara right now. Pokhara backpackers hostel is a very social hostel with a great restaurant and nice hang out area.\nNepal in general is not a party country, most of travelers here are 25-60 years old, no gap year kids from Europe so yeah it\u2019s not Thailand or Vietnam. People go to bed pretty early, I\u2019ve been in Pokhara for 9 days already and haven\u2019t seen any of the bars being busy past 10pm. There is a night club Busy Bee but it was pretty dead when I went there. Also right now there is a parasite infection going on around Pokhara (entamoeba histolytica), a lot of people in hostels are getting sick so yeah not really a party mood around the town. People are exhausted after hikes and the illness that it seems every second person got here already",

These who have the symptoms get tested at the local hospital and get prescribed antibiotics. If left untreated this parasite can damage intestines and liver.\n\nLocals don\u2019t do much, apparently 15% of school kids have this parasite here, around 9% or adults in general population and 30% of patients at hospitals. It\u2019s a common issue because the hygiene standards here are low (outside of big cities many restaurants and hotels don\u2019t have soap and toilet paper in bathrooms and many local people just wash their hands with water only after toilet).\n\nThe parasite is spread through human shit so staff members at restaurants who don\u2019t wash their hands properly and then cook your food can easily infect you.",

    "postText": "So I wanna travel this summer in Europe, from July-august. But I also enrolled in 2 summer courses. They\u2019re entirely online. One of them lasts the whole semester, there\u2019s no exams, only papers. The other one is a 6 week course but it doesn\u2019t start until June 26th so I have no idea how intensive it might be. I emailed the prof twice to ask if there will be lots of papers and exams etc and I received no response.\n\nIt\u2019d benefit me to get these credits out of the way I think, with it being online. But then I also worry that while I\u2019m trying to travel and enjoy myself, my mind might be stuck on \u201comg I gotta go back to my hotel and do x\u201d \n\nUsually I bounce around from country to country every few days. If I was staying in just one country for 2 months, I wouldn\u2019t be stressing as much.\n\nSo I\u2019m not sure if I should drop them. Do you think this might be doable for me? If you have done this before, would you recommend it or did it make your vacation less enjoyable for you?",

Generally depends on the course and I find it better to be in a cheaper country (e.g., I was in Eastern Europe) so then I had an easier time (as a poor student) being okay with just spending a day on classes and maybe only going out to dinner.",

I\u2019ve been getting my work done in the morning/early afternoon and then I\u2019ll have the rest of the afternoon/night and weekends to myself and I like it this way. I\u2019ve even had time to go on some trips that are 3-4 days long. 2 summer courses should be no problem.",

I'm starting school again soon (all online this time around), but I also work over 40 hours a week just to pay for basic bills (not online). My bills are extremely low in comparison to literally every other person I know. So did you just save over time, do you work remotely, or is the helping hand from family just more normal than I have come to think, or something else entirely?",

I usually had fun four days a week and studied during the other three.\n\nI would recommend longer stays in each place if you're not exploring the whole time. At least a week or two, if not more. Packing up all the time gets tiring and you lose time going to different places. The biggest stressor for me was finding internet in rural places. One time I was taking an exam at a library and they turned the wifi off since it was almost closing time. Also, I didn't enjoy staying in hostels while studying. They often spend mid-day cleaning and will kick out guests.\n\nI also had to chat with classmates in real time occasionally and those were a bit annoying to schedule due to the time zone differences but doable.\n\nI'd recommend it! My work-life balance was so good since I knew the more time I spent studying, the less time I had for fun.",

So take that into account with your planning for each day.",

Summer courses will be intense and it\u2019s easy to put it off when you\u2019re in a beautiful place and all you want to do is explore. I would set time in my schedule everyday, like mornings for example, to get work done for a few hours in a cafe/library. Then I let myself be free for the rest of the day. You don\u2019t want the stress to ruin your vacation. It can be fun tho to find nice places with wifi to get work done. Make sure your class is asynchronous",

It's a biology course which I enjoy a lot so I think I'm going to try work on it in the evenings (I don't go out partying and Im uncomfortable going out at night alone as a woman too). I think if you enjoy the topics it helps and won't feel like a chore.",

    "postText": "Will US domestic flights shut down if the debt ceiling impasse is not resolved? Might happen as early as June 1. \n\nAm thinking it would come about because of air traffic controllers being furloughed or something similar.\n\nAnybody know? Have asked some airline customer services via chat with no definitive answer. Have a flight booked in June for solo trip.\n\nThanks.",

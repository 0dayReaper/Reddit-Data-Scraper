    "postText": "I (29F) was in the airport waiting to get on the plane for Bali and so many things were going through my head. I was terrified to travel across the world alone where I wouldn\u2019t know another person for thousands of miles and I was scared to get picked up in the middle of the night in a foreign country by a stranger! I was even texting my sister about backing out after completely rearranging my life to follow this dream of mine.\n\nBut I knew I had to go. So I got on the plane, still terrified, eyes full of tears and I started my journey across the world and embarked on a trip that little did I know, would ultimately change my life forever\u2728\ud83c\udf0d \u2708\ufe0f\n\nWhen I arrived at the airport, I discovered that my roommate who was going to be in the same program and was actually on the plane with me, so I didn't have to get in a car with a stranger alone at all...We actually became best friends, and that two months teaching English became the best two months I've ever had in my life.\n\nWhat scares me now is the fact that I almost DIDN\u2019T go. What TERRIFIES me now is the fact that I almost backed out and missed the opportunity of a lifetime. I will never let fear get in the way of my path and I strongly hope that you don\u2019t either because you could be missing out on something that could end up being extremely pivotal in your journey of life \ud83e\udd8b\u2728\n\n\\*EDIT: I've had so many people reach out and want to know more about the volunteer program I went with. I am so eager to share because of the following:\n\n1. My experience was so amazing that I wish everyone could experience it for themselves...\n\n2. I am not an ambassador or anything for the company, but I know the founder/ the locals who work at the program and they are always looking for volunteers. It's such a good cause that I am happy to share about it.\n\nIf you would like to check out my instagram, Ann\\_mariek- I have an awesome \"highlight\" that really captures my full volunteering experience. I know when I was researching for my trip, watching actually people's stories on Instagram was extremely helpful in deciding. Feel free to check it out and reach out with any questions :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I thought \"Wait, wtf am I doing here? Is this about to all go wrong?\" It ended up being a fantastic trip.",

Because that's the only way  I can see the argument making sense regarding taking jobs away from locals.\n\nBut volunteers provide a service which couldn't otherwise wouldn't be fulfilled. That's the whole point of volunteering, as it would be pointless to provide something which the receiving party could just do or pay for by themselves. Therefore no local jobs are jeopardised. \n\nAlso if the volunteers aren't accepting payment for their work, then no money is being taken out of the local economy. In fact, they more than likely actually inject money due to buying local materials along with living essentials while staying in the area. \n\n That's the way I see it anyway. Perhaps I'm missing something.",

The \"employers\" are happy to accept free labor from rich foreigners, but in the absence of this free labor they might well have employed local people.\n\nI'm not saying it's black and white. But western donations of free labor, free food, free clothing - have complex and often negative long-term effects on a developing economy. \n\nHere's a related question: if western volunteerism is primarily about doing good and making a difference, why do so many volunteers (say from my state of California) prefer to volunteer halfway across the world in Bali, rather than in East LA?",

Like traveling on a tight budget, or even volunteering? And what does it take to accept the offer -once you have it laid out before you?\nLove, Kat",

If your parents are on board with your doing that, cool. If not, then you've so e decisions to make. If you go straight through law school, financed by them and chose to hit the road then, I don't think that would be morally right. If you jump right in to your first law clerk job or whatever, you may never leave that very straight, 9-5 world and get out. Some parents may say \"yeah! rock on!\" to your wanting to travel and others may be guilt trippers because you used their money.\nThere are oodles of volunteer opportunities out there. Everywhere. I have not done that. Rather, I researched, saved, and went. Bali, six times (yeah it's pretty good and may be better again post Covid). \nAnother thought is when and if you choose to have kids with someone your wings will most likely be clipped for awhile. Unless your partner is of similar ilk and wants to travel with the kids . I did take my kids to Bali when they were 8 and 10. And while there I made sure they saw culture, respectfully. We went further out a little, too; Lombok, Gili Air. Back then, the further out from Bali we got, the locals came up and looked at my kids. \ud83d\ude02It was the 90's. \nLaw school can be done later when what you're learning is more relevant because of your experience in life. Good luck with your choices\ud83d\ude4f.",

I actually admire you for being so disciplined, that's something that doesn't come as easily to me, so we are opposites :). You sound like you really do have a desire to take a chance and do something big, I really encourage you to do it and would be happy to share my experience more in detail if you want to DM me!! \n\nThe program is called VP Bali Forever and it all started with a google search and from there I checked reviews and past volunteer's instagrams to see people's true experiences. \n\nActually, South East Asia is extremely cheap once you pay for the flights and get there. I know people who were living off of $10 USD a day, thats including somewhere to sleep at night. Of course that would be a hostel and I'm not sure how comfortable you would be with that, but other rooms are very cheap as well.\n\nIt doesn't take much to accept the offer. The program that I volunteered with you do have to pay, but it was decenty priced and worth every penny.",

I was going to an island 2000+ miles from home where I knew nobody. The following year I had a similar feeling when I was packing for the same trip, but this time I was going for 5 months instead of 1 month. It was a bit 'What do you think you're doing???

Then I got to kuta and was just harassed everywhere. I've been travelling before but always with my boyfriend and I didn't really get bothered with him, but alone? Very different, as I'm sure many people in the sub know. Then a few days into my trip, my boyfriend flew out to see me and spend a few weeks with me till i calmed down and got at ease. We stayed in a nice hostel in ubud he could afford and I arranged to go volunteer with some rescue pups after he had gone. Anyway we had a huge argument a few days later and broke up. I was exhausted at this point, suffering mentally and absolutely broke financially. Id left my job (and walked away from a big bonus) and my home. I had 2 choices, fly home with him and start again or try to navigate extending my visa and going to the rescue place. I went home. I wish i hadnt, but at least I got home safe and my miserable took me back at the bottom of the ladder.",

It was a long layover in Los Angeles and I was all alone at the gate waiting for my flight to connect in Fiji (which, fun fact, had just had a coup), and I remember feeling an \"oh my god, what am I doing?!\" feeling of terror steadily growing on me.  I definitely was weighing going back home as an option.\n\nThe funny thing though was once I got on the plane, I stopped being scared, and I subsequently wasn't scared the entire semester.  In hindsight I think it was one of those things where I made the decision in my mind that I was going to do it, so there was no longer any room to second guess it.  And, of course, that semester abroad was super fun and I did so many things I never dreamed I would when I went- I did whitewater kayaking, bungy jumping (even though I swore that first week to the others in my group that I would *never* do that), and took my first weekend trip to another city alone.  It really set the tone for so many things in my life and led to me doing a RTW and then living abroad for several years, and obviously I'm so very happy I did it.",

I can give you tips- the scariest part for me was having to get in a taxi alone which would make us very vulnerable, and walking alone....but there are precautions you can take. \n\nAlso...once you get settled you will find that you will meet other solo travelers VERY quickly and you don't even have to be alone if you want. Usually people link up and go to the next hostel together, ETC.",

If you know someone who has opened up to you about depression, do more than just acknowledge it - help them seek out help. Take them to appointments, check on them. Them acknowledging their mental health state is not enough.\n\nEdit to add link.",

I was working a lot, but knew I needed something else to feel motivated.\n\nI stumbled upon Parts Unknown, and eventually A Chef's Tour. Then I read Kitchen Confidential and a few other books by Bourdain. There was something in the way he spoke through his writing and in his shows that resonated with me. I know that he had fame and celebrity, but he was truly a very cool guy, who loved the new and strange. I honestly considered him a good friend.\n\nHe inspired me to travel and I would always watch his show for inspiration. All the places I've visited: Vietnam, Cambodia, Israel, Mexico, Italy, London, Amsterdam... they're really all thanks to him. The future ones will be as well.\n\nHug a friend today, or just reach out on the phone or with a text. People are very good at hiding their emotions and 'being there to talk,' is not enough. It's best to be proactive if you care about someone and think they're going through a tough time.\n\nStay safe, fellow solo travelers. Remember wherever you go to respect the locals, try the food, keep your eyes and ears open and allow yourself to be taken for a ride. I'm going to miss Anthony Bourdain, a lot, but I know he's inspired a whole generation of people to experience the world and have an open mind - and we'll keep carrying that mantra wherever we go.",

Thank you for sharing your love of food with the world. Thank you for showing people how amazing and life-changing travel can be. Thank you for diving deep and showing people that the other side of the world and the people who live there are worth learning about. Make no mistake I'm not saying travel is easy, but it's worth it. The world (and all of us) are hard, complicated, and beautiful messes worthy of exploration. Even though my love of travel, food, and culture was there before I saw Anthony Bourdain on TV or read his books he definitely added to that passion. I have no doubt that he helped change the perceptions of many countries and cultures for people who watched him on tv and read his words. \n\nWe all love solo travel on this subreddit, but I know that sometimes solo travel can feel isolating. I know (for myself) that solo travel is always worth it and that loneliness subsides, but I want to say that if you are on the road, or at home and feeling lonely if you are struggling with mental health issues and depression, please talk to someone. The world wants you here. I want you to be here. No matter where you are in the world you are if you are feeling suicidal there is someone you can talk to. Please ask for help because your life is worth living. \n\n[Wikipedia Listing of Suicide Crisis Lines Around the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines)",

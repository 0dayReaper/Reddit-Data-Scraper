    "postText": "In solidarity with our American users in the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision today overturning Roe vs Wade, r/solotravel will allow posts from community members seeking advice on travelling (domestically or internationally) for abortion access, **even if these posts would otherwise break the subreddit rules** - e.g. even if the post is vague/low effort and/or involves travelling with a companion.\n\nThis policy also affects travelers from other countries with limited reproductive rights. Your posts are welcome here.\n\nFor uterus-possessing travelers, the [Gynopedia](https://gynopedia.org/Gynopedia_Index) is a very helpful online wiki with information on local reproductive rights and where/how travelers can access reproductive health care and medications such as the morning-after pill or the abortion pill(s) around the world.\n\nIf you are in need of support (cash, a ride, accommodation), r/auntienetwork is an active network of dedicated volunteers (mostly US-based) who will help you organise whatever assistance you need to get a safe abortion.\n\nIf you need help and don't know where to turn: ASK! There are dozens of abortion funds and support networks across the US who are dedicated to helping women in desperate situations. Someone out there will be able to connect you to the help you need.\n\nHere in the r/solotravel community, we will also do whatever we can to help you plan necessary travel.\n\nYou're not alone. Stay strong. Fight back.",

But still, I think a lot of the hardworking reproductive healthcare providers and activists in the US are aware of these disparities, so hopefully, while we wait to vote out the fascists, we can, in the meantime, try to organize ways to help everyone get an abortion who needs one.",

The extraordinarily bad timing of RBG's passing, and Trump's appointment of Amy Coney Barrett, was the final nail in the coffin of US democracy. At this point, all of the progress that the country has made in the past 50-75 years is about to be rolled back. \n\nThe Democrats have very little chance of ever getting a majority in the Senate that could overrule a filibuster, given that every state no matter its population has two senate seats. The House could go strongly Democrat in a progressive voting wave, but that alone wouldn't be enough to allow a progressive administration to pass much of anything that makes a difference -- and of course, the Supreme Court could strike it down as long as they're inclined to do so (and this court is acting with impunity now).\n\nLifetime political appointments to the highest court in the land was always a terrible idea.",

Voter suppression, gerrymandering and intimidation works because they just have to target a few states where they already have control, to lock them down permanently.\n\nJan. 6 was not \"criticized across the aisle\". Republicans still claim that Trump won. They are putting everything in place to  succeed in 2024 regardless of the actual vote. The negligible few who didn't are being eliminated, and weren't enough anyway. \n\nThey have captured the SC and are cementing their tilt in the voting laws.

But the trend has continued for the Republicans to the point that they have power and could easily keep it for the next 40 years by passing the very legislation you mentioned.   They have a Supreme Court that will back them up. \n\nTake into account that they hold the majority in the state congress's by a lot.  This has allowed them to win the House via gerrymandering even if they were to get fewer votes nationally... Just like the Presidency.   The Senate leans in their direction for the same reason as the Presidency.\n\nKeep in mind they are doing this while nearly every position they hold from immigrants to gay &amp; transgendered rights to common sense gun regulations like background checks are in the minority.\n\nHow could they be so successful while holding the minority view on the issues of the day and being factually incorrect about so many things?\n\nThey have a propaganda network.  It's really just state controlled media but privatized by billionaires.\n\nThe Democrats have no answer for this.

I do it to help people, not to brag about it, but here goes. \n\nFor years, I've volunteered in helping refugees learn my language and get used to life here. We go to the supermarket together, take public transportation together, anything to make life here a bit less confusing and intimidating. Needless to say when the war in Ukraine broke out, I started doing even more since I love Eastern Europe. I also donate blood a few times a year, am registered as a stem cell donor, sign petitions, donate money/ food / whatever is needed whenever I can. This is about all my busy schedule allows as a freelancer and student. Currently, I have been living in Georgia for almost a year, also volunteering here on a workaway project, and helped in collecting all sorts of things to be shipped off to Ukraine, while keeping in touch and helping with my native language over video call with refugees back home. I started volunteering when I was 15, in an elderly home. And it's been a big part of my life ever since. \n\nSo there you go, you want to judge people based on the amount of things they do, now you have it. And yeah this post kinda gives off a \"world revolves around the US, despite women of other nationalities who haven't been able to get an abortion since forever it's only worthy of being mentioned now that it has affected Holy American women\" vibe. I already do quite a few things, and Americans will already receive plenty of help simply because they're American. My help is needed more elsewhere.",

If it was merely a partisan political decision then it could have been done years ago. I would assume they've done it now because its the right answer to the legal questions put to them.",

I am saying that on this debate there isn't one side which is objectively right or wrong. It is a genuine political debate about weighing the interests of different parties all of whom have some form of legitimate interest: the foetus, the mother, the father, the community. I come down on the same side as you but I also recognise there are valid points on the other side - this isn't like genocide or something which is clearly objectively wrong.",

That's the hill you want to fight on? And just for the sake of making some sort of \"devil's advocate\" point?\n\nThat comes across as mean-spirited, trolling, pointlessly obnoxious and deliberately antagonistic behavior that I'm not particularly interested in further engaging with. I'm not getting dragged into a tedious \"intro to philosophy\" debate about morality with you, not when I'm busy grieving for my rights and the rights of my loved ones. \n\nI already said that, even if something *is* a partisan political issue, there's no obligation to be neutral even if (heaven forbid) we're the mods of a subreddit (gasp!).",

We will make more posts like that in the future when there are major issues impacting human rights.

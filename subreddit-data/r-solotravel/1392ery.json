    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI hope you are all doing well. I am travelling to Nepal for a month and will be there from June to July. Unfortunately it is monsoon season there so I can't do the big hikes such as Mount Everest Base Camp as tours do not occur because of mud slides and leeches. Fortunately it is also low season so there won't be many tourists around. I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for what to do out there.\n\nI will be working in Kathmandu whilst I am out there but will have quite a few days free so I was thinking I would go to a safari and maybe go hiking over some nearby villages. Does anyone have any other recommendations? Additionally, I am still thinking if I should stay in a hostel or at a home stay. What are everyone's thoughts?",

Guides are mandatory, as is having a \"travel buddy\" as far as I know (at least when I was researching the route, going solo with a guide wasn't an option at the time).",

Upper mustang is much more accessible though, you can just take a flight to jomsom from pokhara, and then take a jeep or something. Or walk, if you have time. Might have to sort out the guides and permits though.",

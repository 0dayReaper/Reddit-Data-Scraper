    "postText": "I woke up last Saturday with a week off work booked. My intention was to spend the time tidying up, going for walks and trying to ease off a pretty bad case of the blues. I have been reading about the Minoans recently and I was thinking about them as I got up to make my morning coffee. I wanted to see some of the archaeological sites in Greece and it suddenly struck me that there was nothing stopping me. I have no SO, no kids and a fair amount of savings. If anyone can just get up and go, it\u2019s me. \n\nI get bad anxiety and if I had planned a holiday by myself in advance, there\u2019s a good chance I would have chickened out and not gone. \n\nInstead, I just went on my phone and booked flights to Crete and a hotel and then just went on auto-pilot. I topped up my multi-currency debit card and had a nap ready for the drive to the airport. \n\nI was nervous, but I didn\u2019t focus on it. I landed in Heraklion and walked to a car rental shop just outside the airport. I\u2019ve been driving (UK) for about a year and a half and if I had given myself time to overthink, I would not have thought myself capable of driving in another country. Instead, I just hired the damn car and headed to the hotel.\n\nWhat followed was a week of pure bliss. Some days I drove for hours, stopping at anything interesting. Other days I lazed about reading on the beach. I covered loads of Minoan sites, I got talking to the locals and other tourists, I even made friends with a couple and went to their house for lunch. I did everything I was absolutely sure I couldn\u2019t do, and it was liberating. As a 28F, this is the first time I have been confident that I am a capable person, and it feels wonderful.\n\nI could have spent a lifetime considering the \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d. I\u2019m going to spend it on \u201cfuck-its\u201d instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Edit] I\u2019ve had some amazing responses, this community is great.\n[Here are some of my favourite photos from the trip, if anyone\u2019s interested. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/FSRZ2mk)",

Yet everything happens only a certain number of times, and a very small number really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, some afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four or five times more, perhaps not even that. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless.\n\nGet out there.",

I assume everywhere has its own attitude to driving, the roads in Crete worked the same as UK, just driving on the right instead. However, not a lot of drivers obeyed speed limits and it\u2019s customary to drive on the hard shoulder if someone wants to overtake. You pick it up pretty quickly, which was a surprise. I guess all the hire companies really want to know is that you can operate a vehicle. It\u2019s your responsibility to make sure you know the rules.",

Will go to SEA in October, but I think I'll do another solo trip somewhere in Europe in July. I actually was thinking about Crete, see. I went to Malta last summer, and if you haven't you really gotta check it out, not sure what was more stunning between the food, the beaches and all the historic places.

Seeing this and other comments about driving has made me reconsider though. P.s some other people have mentioned Malta - Gozo is utterly wonderful. I stayed in the Old Town and it was perfect. Absolutely lovely, loads of history, incredibly safe - on my last night I happily walked around the old town at 3am - and very easy to navigate on foot or public transport. The people are beautiful too. Happy future travels \u270c\ufe0f",

Best trip I've taken was semi-impulsive and last minute.  I had been reading about neolithic sites and Roman ruins in southern England and Wales, and one day I just suddenly thought, I'm going to go next month!  I booked my flight and it ended up being amazing.  I'll never forget driving my little rented car up to the top of the hill to touch the chalk of the great Horse of Uffington, or driving over a ridge and sucking my breath in at the sight of majestic Stonehenge in the distance!

Spent more time at the sites than I\u2019d expected and truthfully, I didn\u2019t want to carry on to Chania, I stopped at Rethymno instead, which was a great call. I had a rule to be back at the hotel before nightfall and I wouldn\u2019t have had enough time to enjoy myself, constantly thinking about how much time I need to drive back. Rethymno was on the way back so I had loads more time. It\u2019s kind of like making a plan but not having to stick to it. You also don\u2019t need to consult anyone else or consider what other people would prefer to do.",

Also going by public transport is way better (imo) when you're solo travelling as you meet locals and they tell you so many new and different things along the way, \n\nI am with you on this !!

            "comment": "I hit similar spots in Romania and Bulgaria a few years back, Romania is great.\n\nBiggest thing I'd say is go with the flow, rather than having exact dates for everything. You might love a place and want to stay longer, might dislike a place and stay less, might meet the right people and deviate from your plans to travel to different places.\n\nFor example, Hue/Da-Nang/Hoi An is a lot of time for that area, Hoi An is amazing but I imagine you'll get quite bored in Hue and Da-Nang for so long, and perhaps stay longer in Hoi An. For what it's worth, Vietnam is absolutely incredible. \n\nFor Thailand, no desire to hit any of the islands? Bangkok can be a lot, and hitting Phuket as well? Consider heading down to Kho Phangan, Kho Tau or Kho Samui. Everyone is different, but after 3 days I ran away from Bangkok, although I can't speak for Phuket, the islands were my highlights. Also consider Pai up north.\n\nI guess my general feeling is that you're hitting all the bigger ticket cities, without exploring any of the smaller, more countryside places, which are often the highlights in these countries, particularly Asia!\nKampot in Cambodia, Dalat and the Ha Giang Loop (absolute must see) in Vietnam, the islands in Thailand etc.",

            "comment": "Having been to vietnam for a month, you should definitely do the Ha Giang loop up in the north. Was by far the best experience I had in Vietnam. It\u2019s a 3-4 (recommend 4) motorbike tour through the rural mountains of northern Vietnam. As for Halong, it was for sure a really good experience. But if you can try to do it with another person. I did it solo myself but you basically have to pay double the price. I would also shorten the time in both Hue and da Nang. But really go with the flow and don\u2019t plan ahead so much.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! Planning a ~2 month trip to Central America. Could be longer if money holds out. I\u2019m looking to go through Guatemala, Nicaragua &amp; Colombia. I\u2019m really interested in hiking, snorkeling, staying in cool hostels with nice events &amp; learning more spanish. I\u2019ve attached my current ideas below; Any must-see places I\u2019m missing? Should I add in Costa Rica? I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s expensive &amp; touristic so I\u2019m a bit inclined to leave it out. \n\nThanks in advance!\n\nGuatemala\nDry season: Nov-April\nBudget: 35-45 USD/day\nFlores: Tikal Ruins \nAntigua: Hike up Volcano Acatenango\nLake Atitlan (look into it\u2019s ethical to go) \nSan Pedro: Panajachel - local market,\nWorldpackers? Teach English or farm?\nEl Paredon : Surf camp \ud83d\ude42\n\n\nNicaragua\nBudget: 30-50 USD/day\nLeon: Volcano boarding at Volcano Cerro Negro\nOmetepe : rent moped, explore island\nGranada\n\nColombia\nBudget: 25-50 USD/day\nTayrona National Park: Cabo San Juan Beach, Playa Cristal\nMedellin: Free city walking tour, Guatepe lake\nSalento: Valle de Cocora, Santa Rita waterfall\nMinca: La Ciudad Perdita hike (!!), Finca Victoria coffee plantation",

It was a COVID time so things might be different now. 35 dollars a day back then was absolutely not doable, 45 dollars was barely double. Transportation between places was expensive and also food is not cheap either, we had a hard time finding food cheaper than 10-12 dollars per meal in Antigua. Semuc Champey was a nice way to break the minivan trip from San Pedro to Tikal, so if you have an extra day or two might check it out, it\u2019s nice.\n\nIn Nicaragua definitely visit volcano Masaya and go to  Laguna de Apoyo if you like kayaking. Also, Nicaragua was the only Central American country where the budget of 35 dollars a day was actually double. \n\nIn Colombia I\u2019d skip Minca (it\u2019s meh, the waterfalls are not that pretty and the sand flies are just awful there, I\u2019ve never been bitten so badly in my life) and I\u2019d include Jardin (it\u2019s pretty close to Salento).\n\nI do not recommend Costa Rica at all, Panama is better in every sense, it has everything that Costa Rica has but cheaper, better and with less tourists.",

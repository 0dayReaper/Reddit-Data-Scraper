    "postText": "I\u2019m looking at accommodation on booking.com for portugal for a week in June and it\u2019s coming to around \u00a3800 . This is not even for fancy hotels but just private rooms in hostels in Porto and Lisbon . I\u2019ve done all inclusive in fancy resorts for \u00a3500 a week around the same time in turkey so this is quite surprising to me, am i just looking at a really busy time or is this the standard cost of accommodation now?",

Otherwise just shop around on other sites and see if the same (or similar) rooms are available for a better price elsewhere.",

For example if you carry expensive items like laptops.  \nDo you bring valuable gear with you when you travel solo? If so, how do you keep it safe? Do you rely on lockers in hostels or hotels, or do you carry it with you at all times? Have you ever had any bad experiences with theft or loss of valuable items while traveling?  \nI would love to hear your tips and tricks! Particularly in shared places like hostels. Thank you!",

Most hostels will at minimum have a small locker to store valuables, if not a full sized locker that can fit your entire bag. The smallest locker I've had at a hostel was still able to store my camera. \n\nIf the locker isn't big enough for a bag/laptop, I just keep the laptop in my bag and lock it. It won't prevent thieves if they really want to get into the bag, but in my experience, random thieves don't get into reputable hostels - most stories you hear are the other roommates that do the stealing. You just have to trust your instincts and get a feel for your roommates. If they're all backpackers with the typical well known travel gear brands, chances are they're not gonna be stealing your things. \n\nYou can also ask the front desk to store your valuables if there isn't a large enough locker. They'll typically have some sort of backroom or locker to keep their own valuables.\n\nIn hotels, I've never had a problem. I just keep everything in my bag.",

I always thought I would have no problem travelling alone, as that\u2019s the sort of thing I\u2019m use to at home. But I\u2019m starting to realize that\u2019s not what I was comfortable with- it\u2019s the comfort of the familiar. Routine has always been my safety blanket. Knowing what comes next gives me peace of mind.\n\nThis trip offers the opposite. I\u2019m not sure what to expect in the places that I find myself in. Whether I\u2019m doing the right things or not. Is it bad that I ordered in twice already? Shouldn\u2019t I be on the streets from dawn til dusk? What will other people think if they knew I spent considerable time in my apartment? What a waste!\n\nThese thoughts play on my sense of being an imposter. Do these qualities reflect that of a solo traveller? Probably not. But I\u2019m okay with that- at least I\u2019m trying to be. I should cut myself some slack; this is my first time travelling in a foreign country with no local support. Isn\u2019t it realistic to fall into some of my old tendencies? \n\nNobody said it would be easy making this trip. Change is hard, and it\u2019s certainly not fast. Routine is resistant to change. It comes gradually with directed effort. I\u2019ve gone to more cafes and pubs than I ever did in my hometown. That\u2019s a win in my mind. Hey, maybe now I\u2019ll finally go downtown with my girlfriend when she asks. \n\nI\u2019m slowly challenging my fear of the unknown. Talking to people that I don\u2019t know anything about. Made two American friends that I actually vibed with. Talked to a local that chewed my ear off. Chatted with an Aussie that didn\u2019t seem all that interested. For better or worse, these are a myriad of experiences that I wouldn\u2019t have had if I decided to be my clammed, introverted-self.\n\nWhile I still have many hills to climb, small victories of the unknown are slowly becoming my comfort. I\u2019m making a habit of putting myself in uncomfortable situations- albeit in manageable doses.",

The contract I have with my job will be ending in July, and I want to travel for a month before I go back home to the states. But I am having trouble deciding where I would like to go. I'm really into nature and adventurous places when i travel. So The first place I had in mind would be to go hiking in Norway. My issue is that I have a lot of experience hiking by myself and for up to 12 hours in a day, but I have very little experience with camping and hotels are out of my budget. As much as I'd really like to do it, it's probably unwise for my first camping trip to be alone, right? So my other option I'm considering is going to Thailand instead since the only other place in Asia I've been to is Turkey and it would be another place that I can explore. Any advice would be much appreciated.",

You should probably use some caution and not get super wasted (18 is below the drinking age in Japan anyway), but it's generally a safe country, and you'll be able to get by with no Japanese skills. I can't think of any particular tips you would need in relation to you being young/female/solo.",

Not into night life so much \n\nLast thing. I\u2019d be buying the flight with miles, which right now would be about 80,000 round trip. For you personally, is that many miles with the trip?

I'll be staying in hostels in Europe for a few weeks and have the option of 30+ person rooms or 8-12 in Prague.\n\nI haven't been able to find anything on the comparison. Is 30+ people miserable or enjoyable? On one hand I could see it being a cool experience, I could also see a lot of room for stuff to go wrong with it. Is it worth trying or should I just stick to a smaller room size?  \n\n\nAnother Question, I'll be on a bit of a budget and trying to keep it as cheap as I can while doing a lot. I have a choice between either 3 nights and 2 full days in Berlin and 2 nights and 1 full day in Amsterdam or 2 nights 1 full day in Berlin and 3 nights 2 full Days in Amsterdam. Any suggestions on what'd be better?\n\nI know Berlin is cheaper and I think there's more there I wanna see, wheras Amsterdam is the #1 city I've wanted to visit but I don't know what else to do there aside from the weed cafes and being able to bike around. Ideally I'd like more time in each but my trip is going to be getting a little bit of everything.",

If your only reason for booking it is an experience and money's not an issue, then I personally wouldn't bother with a giant room, don't really see the point.",

People are just going about their business in a respectful manner - sorting out their belongings, changing, coming and going, resting in their bed, or sleeping. Some may be talking and socializing, but many will be respectful not to cause too much of a ruckus. You're not going to notice what the person across the room is doing. Of course, YMMV but it's certainly not some chaotic free for all some people imagine.\n\nResearch each of the city's attractions and decide which you want to spend more time. Amsterdam has some well known museums (Rijksmuseum, Anne Frank House, Van Gogh Museum) if you're into museums and art.",

By that, I mean, if you've flown all night and gotten very little sleep on the plane, and you land exhausted but it's only noon, resist the temptation to nap. Go walk around, sightsee, fight through the jet lag for the first day. And go to sleep at a normal hour on local time at your destination. It'll make for a miserable day 1, but after that, you'll be fine for the rest of your trip. \n\nAlso, a lot of jet lag is dehydration. Drink LOTS of water on the flight, avoid caffeine or alcohol while flying or during the first day or two, and do your best to stay hydrated. It makes a difference.",

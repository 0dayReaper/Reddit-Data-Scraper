    "postText": "Hi All, \n\nI booked myself a 10 day solo trip to CR leaving in 2.5 days. \n\nI'm going to be going from SJ to Jaco and along the pacific coast mostly. I'm looking to get a mix of sight seeing, surfing (lots of this hopefully), and good food. \n\nI'll be staying in Hostels my entire trip. \n\nMy biggest concern is transportation. I've read mostly horror stories regarding rented vehicles but was wondering if anyone has opinions on either renting or using a combinations of buses and shuttles. \n\nI'll happily update this post after my trip if there is interest as well :)",

            "comment": "I wouldn\u2019t :) I was there for 1.5 months and bused the whole country. Buses usually cost $1-3 dollars and it avoids you having to navigate the roads and drivers. And if you want a little more express from time to time there\u2019s shared shuttles that go from different parts of the country for around $50usd",

But make sure to rent a bigger car than can handle dirt roads. We rented a small Toyota Yaris at first, and had to go back to the rental shop to get a bigger car that could handle some of the rougher roads.",

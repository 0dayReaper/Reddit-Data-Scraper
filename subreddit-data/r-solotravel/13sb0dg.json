    "postText": "Hey all, I\u2019m working on a farm in Carnoules and I\u2019m headed to Marseille for Saturday night. Looking for all around recommendations, favorite lowkey places to eat (cafes, diners, anything cheap and lowkey), best beaches, thrift stores. I really enjoy thrifting and nightlife. I already got a ticket to Danceteria for a show but that doesn\u2019t start till late.\n\nBEFORE YOU COMMENT - I know people think Marseille is \u201cdangerous\u201d which is just a nice way of saying scared of poverty so please don\u2019t reply with something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s dangerous here\u201d\n\nI\u2019m on a budget and cheap but willing to spend a little to have a fun time.",

            "comment": "I know it's not the recommendation you're looking for.. but if you have time on Sunday check out the Calanques.. It's really gorgeous and Marseille has a 'single price' bus ticketing system.. So the bus to go to Cassis costs the same as going around Marseille.\n\nYou can do some hiking, or just some bathing or even rent a kayak and explore on the water.",

            "comment": "I've spent lots of time in Marseille. Reports of its dangerousness are greatly exaggerated outside of a few neighborhoods far from where you'll be going as a tourist.\n\nFor thrift, well, Notre Dame de la Garde overlooks the whole city, offers a great view, you can catch a city bus or even walk up there.\n\nNot big into clubbing or dining myself but I can at least advise you to stay away from Vieux Port (for drinks or food, it's still worth walking around). Near the canabiere there is a little market area of people selling fruit and veggies and street food and stuff reminiscent of capo in Palermo or something.\n\nLike has been said, the calanques are great, and lots of boat tours and excursions, also chateau d'if and \u00eele de Frioul.\n\nEdit: Chateau du Pharoh and Palais Longchamps are both gorgeous parks and palaces that are free to access as well.",

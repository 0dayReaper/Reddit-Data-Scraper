    "postText": "I have two weeks in Vietnam as part of a bigger trip. I fly into Hanoi and out of Ho Chi Minh 15 days later.\n\nI love nature, mountains, caves and beaches. I'm not fussed about cities or Ha Long Bay. Can I have some suggestions for my itinerary?\n\nThoughts so far:\n\nHanoi- 2 nights\nCao bang - 3 nights\nPhong nha - 3 nights\nNha trang - 2 nights \nHo Chi min - 3 nights (one day for Din mountain)\n\nI'll probably travel by train and overnight bus. I've spent some time in SE Asia and can't wait to get to Vietnam.\nThanks!",

Go to Ha Giang instead (3 or 4 day tour) for stunning mountains. \n\nWould also highly recommend ninh binh and phong nha for nature and trekking.\n\nBeaches - go to \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng, Hoi An is 30 minute drive away if you want to do a day trip. \n\nBeen to Vietnam a few times so don\u2019t think you can visit all your first time.",

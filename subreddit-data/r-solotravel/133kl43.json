    "postText": "Last year I bought the 3 month interrail ticket during the anniversary sale. My plan, starting in a few weeks is to go for a 5 week trip.  I have done a solo travel trip before but not nearly as long. I have a few questions, both about the itinerary and train travel.\n\nMy main plan is to see atleast the major cities. Deeply interested in history. I do have some shorter walks/hikes planned though less than i would have liked, i guess being bound to raillines makes hiking harder. I also would have liked to do some crosscountry mountainbiking but I couldnt really find clear websites with trails (in the Netherlands there is a nice website with all the trails and community ratings so I am a bit spoiled), in order to scratch the cycling itch I want to cycle near trondheim so I got some excersibe before I have 2-3 days of mainly travelling.\n\nstart location end location traveltime notes\n\nSaturday 13-5 Eindhoven Hamburg 5,5\n\nSunday  14-5 Hamburg Arhus  5,5 Stop in Flensburg\n\nMonday 15-5 Arhus  Arhus\n\nTuesday 16-5 Arhus  Copenhagen 3,5\n\nWednesday 17-5 Kopenhagen Copenhagen\n\nThursday 18-5 Copenhagen Copenhagen\n\nFriday  19-5 Copenhagen Copenhagen\n\nSaturday 20-5 Copenhagen stockholm 5,5\n\nSunday  21-5 stockholm stockholm\n\nMonday 22-5 stockholm stockholm\n\nTuesday 23-5 stockholm stockholm\n\nWednesday 24-5 stockholm Trondheim 12,5 Nighttrain\n\nThursday 25-5 Trondheim Trondheim\n\nFriday  26-5 Trondheim Trondheim\n\nSaturday 27-5 Trondheim Bodo  10 Nordlandsbanen, 8 uur sochtends\n\nSunday  28-5 Bodo  Narvik  6 ongeveer met bus\n\nMonday 29-5 Narvik  Boden  7\n\nTuesday 30-5 Boden  Oulu  7?\n\nWednesday 31-5 Oulu  Oulu\n\nThursday 1-6 Oulu  Kuopio  4,5\n\nFriday  2-6 Kuopio  Helsinki  4,5\n\nSaturday 3-6 Helsinki  Helsinki\n\nSunday  4-6 Helsinki  Helsinki\n\nMonday 5-6 Helsinki  Tallin  3 ferry\n\nTuesday 6-6 Tallin  Tallin\n\nWednesday 7-6 Tallin  Tallin\n\nThursday 8-6 Tallin  Tartu  2,5\n\nFriday  9-6 Tartu  Riga  5\n\nSaturday 10-6 Riga  Riga\n\nSunday  11-6 Riga  Vilnius  5 bus\n\nMonday 12-6 Vilnius  Vilnius\n\nTuesday 13-6 vilnius  vilnius\n\nWednesday 14-6 Vilnius  Kaunas  2\n\nThursday 15-6 Kaunas  Kaunas\n\nFriday  16-6 Kaunas  Warschau 7 bus\n\nSaturday 17-6 Warschau Warschau\n\nSunday  18-6 Warschau Eindhoven 13-14 :(\n\n[https://gyazo.com/2e8d84f0c7bb85955cf9da16a850b22c](https://gyazo.com/2e8d84f0c7bb85955cf9da16a850b22c)\n\n(clearer overview) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to do the Trondheim to Bodo trainride for the scenic view however I dont care much about the town of Bodo, the next day I head over to narvik and after a night and a half a day there i head back into Sweden so i can go to Finland. There are two viable trains, one daytrain and a nighttrain. Would it make sense to take the nighttrain towards Bodo, as far as i know at this time of year the sun doesnt set. Doing this would save me about a night in Bodo but i guess I would be both tired during the trainride and busride the next day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny feedback on the itineray I feel that there is a lot of time in both Copenhagen and Stockholm (which I can probably fill without any problems) but far less for the later cities especially in the Baltic. Would it make sense to remove some days from my early locations so I can use these for later destinations?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do feel a bit Anxious about the train tables. Here in the Netherlands I am quite used to stations having a train atleast once a half hour. There are however frequent interruptions which means that there are a lot of delays which makes getting on time for a connection tricky. For my interrail trip there are quite a few trainstops that only seem to get which train I want once or twice a day. Which means that any connection in my mind is a massive risk. How reliable are the trainservices in Scandinavia?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice or experiences from your own travels in these countries would be appreciated aswell :)",

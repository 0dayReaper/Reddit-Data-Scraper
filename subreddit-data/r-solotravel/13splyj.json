My initial plan was to fly out to Bangkok spend one month in Thailand one month in Sri Lanka and then one month in rishikesh India. But there are so many other places in the world that I\u2019d like to visit particularly the great pyramids of Giza, Gobekli Tepe in turkey and gunung Padang in Indonesia and I\u2019m wondering if I can fit this all in on a 3 month trip\u2026 I have found all the flight necessary and it does work but I\u2019m just questioning weather I\u2019m over complicating things for myself, this would bring my time in Sri Lanka down to 3 weeks and my time in India down to 2 weeks to fit it all in, is this enough time to fully experience these countries?

No.\n\n2 weeks in India is a drop in the ocean,for example.But if you just want to see one or two places there (you only mention Rishikesh)..sure,it can be done.\n\nOTOH....I am assuming you are 'young' and will have plenty of other travel opportunities in the future...in that case,there is no need to try and fit every place you want to see in the world into the same trip!",

I understand the desire to go everywhere and see everything but in reality you\u2019ll just tire yourself out and not enjoy yourself as much. Your original plan sounds much more like a good time. \n\nWhen travelling, the phrase \u2018less is more\u2019 is definitely applicable.",

One month in each country is a solid move and you\u2019ll be able to travel locally / by public transport to see plenty. You\u2019ll have plenty of time to visit other areas in the future (I\u2019m guessing)",

I can see some merit if you want to combine it with Sri Lanka, but to me all the rest you mention look like clearly distinct trips and zero merit to combine them unless you make it a 3 month overlanding trip but even then, imho time is too short.",

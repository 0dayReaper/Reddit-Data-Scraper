    "postText": "It can be any song that you are really enjoying at the time but listen to it as often as you can. That song will be permanently associated with that trip and the good times you had every time you listen to it afterwards. The good memories of that trip will come flooding back every time you listen to that song for the rest of your life. I have so many songs that literally transport me all over the world the moment I hear them and I love it so much.",

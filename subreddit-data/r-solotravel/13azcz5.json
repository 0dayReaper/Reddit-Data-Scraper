    "postText": "I'm visiting Poland solo for about 6 days in July. \n\nWarsaw or another city- 3 days\n\nKrakow - 3 days\n\nI just want to do 2 cities my first time there. I enjoy walking around and checking out sites, occasionally going to museums, and food. Also, nightlife is pretty important to me. I enjoy going to night clubs as opposed to bars or sitting down in restaurants all night. I specifically like clubs that play EDM. I was thinking Warsaw for 3 days then Krakow for 3 days. I wouldn't mind checking out another city other than Warsaw if it meets the criteria above. any suggestions are welcome.",

Such an awesome vibe by the port and there are many day trip opportunities there. Highly recommend you visit there! Plan to visit Wroclaw later this year, but i have not been there yet. Seems amazing though!",

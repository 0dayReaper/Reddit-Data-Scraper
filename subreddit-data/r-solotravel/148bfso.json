    "postText": "As an international traveller, have you found entering the US through Hawaii to be easier?\n\nI've entered the US through Hawaii and also the mainland; when I landed in Hawaii, it was extremely easy, it took almost no time to get through immigration, the officers were friendly and easygoing and didn't grill me or even seem that bothered.\n\nBut when I entered another time, through San Francisco, it took hours and I was basically interrogated, taken into a back room and had my bags searched, threatened and treated badly, to the point where I missed my connecting flight, and it's not an experience I ever want to have again as a solo female traveller.\n\nSo what I'm wondering is, was my first experience entering via Hawaii a fluke, or is it always like that?  I want to go back to the US soon, but I don't want a repeat of my bad experience.\n\nEdit - also, I'm not planning on or talking about actually spending time in Hawaii as a tourist, but rather using it as the entry point before flying to the mainland.  I know there are ethical issues surrounding tourism in Hawaii.",

I was the only car and they strip searched it for an hour. Nothing suspicious about me nothing found I don't know. Ive flown from Europe to Logan in Boston and went through the line lickety split, customs was courteous, kind and virtually just waved me through..\n\n\nGenerally entering from Europe I've never had any issue at Logan so who knows. I'm sure it depends on a lot of the character at the customs desk, the alert level, and of course you. Who knows but I don't think there's one rule for all",

Maybe I'll just order poutine at home.\"\n\nI suppose the people that have a hard time are gonna talk about it more than the people that had no problems but it still sounds ridiculous.

I had been wandering through Quebec. I live in New Hampshire, and have old roots in the Northeast Kingdom, Vermont, so I thought it would cross at Richford. As I came down the road and saw the fortified American border station with no cars I knew this was going to go swimmingly well and quick or down the toilet.. and down the toilet it went.. no sass or attitude on my part, but they were bored and really interrogated me in a way I was not pleased with..\n\n\nLater on visiting my friend in St Albans who owns apartments, I noticed that the asshole at the border was also one of her tenants.. Small world..\n\nNext time, I will stick to 89. I have a van these days though and I'm not sure if that also raises a red flag so I've hesitated to cross.. Maybe I'll just stick with international traveling to Europe it's so much easier",

I think it's worth the trip, but the 5-10 minutes to cross the border do spike my anxiety. **In the end I think it's worth it.** Unlike in the 90s, you do need either a passport (the $30 or $40 passport card works too, but it won't get you in anywhere outside North America) or Enhanced drivers license, which only a few states offer\n\n\nIn April I stopped further up than I was supposed to as I was entering Quebec and I told the guy I didn't know I was supposed to stop further back, and he just smiled and said there were signs (in English and French... I speak/read both). He gave me a bit of \"I'm sorry, but you really shouldn't have done that\" and then had me on my way into Canada!",

It really put a damper in travel and something else happened along the way as well with US police that put a distinct disdain for unwarranted detention in my head . And of course this all in the aftermath and the climate of Donald..\n\nSo by the time I was coming back from Europe I was really ready for a third degree and a bit apprehensive.. The line was long, but it moved quickly and when I arrived at the custom agent, he just looked at me with a nice smile and said where have you been. And I said I've been to Germany Poland, family visit and touring, for a month and a half, and he said did you have a good time? And did you have anything to declare. And then with a big smile he said welcome home , Sir ,and I almost cried from the pent up anxiety.. It was the best welcome home I had ever heard..\n\n. I just traveled again and came back and equally flew through customs in Amsterdam and on the Boston side.. I was totally impressed.. But I think it's all about timing and chance of course",

I don't speak Farsi so my mom was doing the paperwork for me. It took half a year before we finally got it, only for me to point out that the birthdate they put was older than my mom's, which went unnoticed I imagine due to the calendar conversion. So we had to repeat the process. We started a year and a half before we left for Iran and nearly didn't have passports in time for the trip. The Iranian embassy in DC is some tiny little thing tucked into I think(?) the Pakistani embassy (or another country nearby) and it is unspeakably incompetent.",

Luckily there is a global entry line which makes it more tolerable but I\u2019d enter via LAX 8/10 times unless I\u2019m getting a free stopover in HNL.\n\nEdit: sorry, didn\u2019t read the whole bad experience but I\u2019ve had several encounters like that as well all over. Immigration is very strict and the slightest discrepancy or sign of increased anxiety and they will ask you questions until they are satisfied.",

I do have to say, and I have no evidence other than my life flying through these airports and being stopped countless times, that where it says where I was born on my passport is probably causing the hold up. It starts at the check in counter where they take my passport somewhere to a back room and they have \u201ccheck on something real quick.\u201d , it\u2019s never real quick and happens 9/10 times. Even though I\u2019m a dual US/UK citizen with both official passports they still play trivia time with me when I come back home or go to Europe. \n\nMost recent experience was last year where I was flying back and forth for six months to England because my grandmother passed away and I had to handle her affairs and packing up her flat. They would ask questions trying to see if I\u2019m going there for other reasons and then when I came back in one instance the customs officer asked why I keep coming and going so much so I told them my grandmother died and I had to go to the funeral and handle stuff and all I got was \u201c\u2026.well, it is what it is. That\u2019s life then you die.\u201d Then handed me my passport and and waved me though saying, \u201cwelcome home\u201d. \n\nOn the whole, it\u2019s honestly luck of the draw who\u2019s having a bad day, who just wants to make everybody miserable cause they\u2019re on a power trip, and the few lovely angels who just want to make your day and not perform an interrogation.",

Try flying into smaller airports like Seattle (still a big city/airport but not San Fran big) or the biggest airports like Atlanta, Minneapolis and Denver. You might get a better experience there! Happy traveling!",

            "comment": "Hi! I'm so curious where you coming from for it to make sense to go through Hawaii( I assume Oceania/Polynesia?), but I hope you have a better time coming to the US next time! I  am born and raised in NYC, and have travelled a lot nationally and internationally as a solo female traveler as well. I would say east coast people/ customs are already viewed as Ruder than west coast people, and tbh customs/border patrol kinds of proves it to be true ( but I swear outside of the airport were pretty nice :)). Ive also travelled via car  and train to Canada every year ( since I was a kid)to visit my cousins and generally speaking, the American side are a bit more \"hardcore\". I think it's the national security culture of the US, mixed with the culture of the area/ if you arriving in a hub city area, and if there are high alert international  issues happening.I only went to Hawaii once for a research class, but culturally it's it's on thing/occupied by the US, and environmentally/resource wise it's more low key. So I imagine that translates around security in the airport being consistently low key and you will have a less demeaning time going through the airport. But that was like 16 yrs ago at this point when I was there,  so I could be deeply misinformed. However, if you have to go out of your way to go to Hawaii to get to the mainland, I wouldn't think it would be worth it. Also, just re read your thread closely, truly sorry you had that experience. It sounds really awful and I hope that doesn't happen again.",

I've had the worst time in Los Angeles - got pulled aside for secondary screening a couple of times coming back from east Asia.\n\nLast time I reentered the country was through Houston, coming back from Ecuador, and it was zero fuss. Long line, but no hassling.\n\nThey do look at other factors when selecting you for secondary screening. One time, I'd flown to Hong Kong and then returned via Bangkok (having caught a flight from Guangzhou to Bangkok after finishing my business in HK and China) and I was also carrying a big brick of adhesive rubber bumpers that probably looked suspicious. The Ecuador trip was purely vacation and didn't look as unusual.",

            "comment": "Reposting this because it's for both the original question &amp; one of the responses:\n\nThere used to be racial profiling reasons after 9/11, but I know they kicked up a huge fuss. My dad is dark-skinned European with \"exotic\" features (not often seen in Caucasians), and he traveled nationally for work, so he would get \"randomly\"  pulled aside at random airports (large &amp; small) for searches. I'd say it happened 2 out of every 3 airplane trips he made. Things have changed since then. \n\nI've been to Hawaii a few times. As a US national arriving and leaving, I've found it to be a refreshingly relaxing experience, but I can't speak for the international division of their customs department. \n\nThe only non-chill exception was during the pandemic when they were *absolutely anal* about vaccination cards and you had to fill out information online at this certain website, show proof before boarding, and then they gave you a purple club entrance bracelet to show you'd been cleared to enter, otherwise the lines to enter the state at their airports were hours long. But no strip searches, etc.\n\nAlso, I cant speak for for the Canadian border patrol, but US border &amp; crossings  has been on high alert since the Trump presidency. So that's a fair warning on any experience you might have entering from any airport. Their job isn't to make you feel comfortable, but rather to make you feel uncomfortable so you talk yourself into a corner or spill information you might not have given otherwise  - pressure &amp; anxiety have a tendency to make people do that. \n\nJust keep your calm and make sure you have no contraband and you'll be fine, no matter where you enter. Can't guarantee your experience will be fantastic, but if you're mentally prepared it'll be okay. \n\nEdit: removed previous edit comment from my copy &amp; paste to this comment. *(facepalm)*",

I\u2019m not familiar with the international side as it was my first time flying in to HNL from a foreign country, but typically I fly domestically from OAK or SFO to Hawaii and for Hawaii they always have you fill out an agricultural declaration form during the plane ride. I was flying with ZipAir and no one requested I fill one out and wasn\u2019t even asked after landing. Also it was my first international trip since 2019 and if I recall they usually have you fill out a customs declaration form that you provide to the agents. No one asked me to fill out that or even verbally declare I had nothing to declare. The agent just asked me my purpose and where I came from and then said I can go.",

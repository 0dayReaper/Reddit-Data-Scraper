    "postText": "I'm so upset. I was supposed to be departing for Belgium tomorrow on the Eurostar... only for my aunt to tell me I had booked the wrong date. I booked it for next week instead of tomorrow, so I quickly had to spend money on an overnight bus and lost my Eurostar fare because it was non-refundable. :/\n\nSpeaking as a meticulous planner, I nearly had a nervous breakdown. I was in the middle of a crowded museum when I realized my fuck-up and almost burst into tears right then and there!\n\nI know what's done is done, but I'm genuinely so upset of how stupid I was to have picked the wrong date. My friends have been trying to make me feel better by saying everyone has fucked up badly at least once when they're traveling, and I must say it makes me feel a bit better knowing I'm not as unbelievably dumb and hopeless as I'm making it out to be.\n\nSo share your stories with me while I'm waiting for my emergency overnight bus? :')\n\nEDIT: Welp, passed out pretty hard on the bus. The stress wore me out, I guess. \ud83d\ude02 But I've read all your comments so far and appreciate every one of them! Thanks for making me feel better. \ud83e\udd7a",

I of course freaked out, quickly packed my stuff as I said, WAIT WAIT. The gate agent was actually sympathetic even though it was my dumbass fault and said once the door is closed, they can't let anyone on. Luckily they let me take the next days flight but I really wanted to head-butt the wall considering I've been waiting for this Hong Kong trip for months and I was planning to only spend 6 days there. \n\nAlso dated that girl for 3 months then cheated on me.

They had to bring out the elders to check us out &amp; give the ok or not, one of our party the gf on the back of the bike was fainting &amp; ill from altitude sickness but we were stuck. The nomads kindly cleared out one tent for the 4 of us it stank of rancid yak butter *so badly* it was suffocating &amp; stank disgusting enough to make all of us nearly puke but it was freeezzziiing out there in the horizontally flying snow &amp; sleet so we had to just suck it up, gratefully.\n\nThen we got worried we were running out of bottled water &amp; fu\\*k what would we do *if they offered us food* we\u2019d be rude not to eat it but knew for sure we\u2019d probably get food poisoning &amp; diarrhea *at the least* if we ate it.  The younger males of the group were starting to look over our bikes &amp; gear which each bike represented like 10 years worth of earnings to them and we were in a totally deserted area nobody else knew we were there, heck *we didn\u2019t* even know where we were lmao so we were getting pretty nervous about the whole thing.  Any time one of us needed to go toilet (just over there behind any boulder) we had to get one of the hardcore mammas to accompany so the tribes Tibetan mastiff guard dogs as big as lions wouldn\u2019t eat us, it was pretty nerve-wracking.\n\nThen as mountain weather goes, within 2 hours the mini-blizzard cleared off &amp; it was brilliant sunshine again, one of the nicer members had high-tailed it by horse over to another nearby nomad camp to bring back a dude who spoke some English - they all cantered over the ridge like in a movie on these amazing sturdy Tibetan ponies, he advised us to get going while the weather was good &amp; before our stuff got pillaged, told us where we\u2019d taken the wrong turning &amp; how to get back &amp; reach a safe wayside travellers refuge tent just one more side valley over, and even rode on ahead a little to guide us on the right way &amp; escort us out safely from that camp.\n\nSo yeah our fuck-up taking the wrong turning, that unscheduled *tent* we\u2019d stayed in for a few hours, well, we didn\u2019t really enjoy it so much per se, but it saved us from getting frostbite from being wet &amp; icy, and afterwards, wow the whole experience was pretty cool.  Regretted none of us had got any photos cos yeah, it just was not an appropriate place &amp; time to pull out cameras &amp; start snapping away lol.",

            "comment": "Activated my 300\u20ac interrail pass to take the train from Athens to Thessaloniki, booked the ticket, went to the station and realized I needed to get a seat. I then learned that I apparently hadn\u2019t actually booked the ticket and I had to wait until the next day- but I had already used a travel day, so I was out the ticket regardless. So I ended up taking a bus instead. Then I found out that are aren\u2019t actually any trains between Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia, despite the website telling me there were. My bad for not researching enough, but I ended up only using 6/10 travel days and spent a ton on busses instead. And if I hadn\u2019t activated it right before realizing it wasn\u2019t really useful, I could\u2019ve saved it for another trip. I also forgot my student ID and was salty every time I could\u2019ve gotten a 10% discount and didn\u2019t haha. \n\nIt sucked, but at the end of the day I was just out a bit of money. I tried to think of it as being better than getting pickpocketed.",

            "comment": "I'm a meticulous planner and had a pretty tight budget for my Ecuador trip (10 yrs ago).  I budgeted taking the bus to the airport on the way back because it'd only cost $6US vs $35US. At the end of my trip, I had exactly $25US left in my posession...I was actually very proud of my budgeting at the time. I checked the bus schedule online the night before my flight to make sure I have sufficient time to get to the airport (Quito airport is 1 hr away from downtown Quito). When I arrived to the bus station, I was searching for the bus that was suppose to depart in 30 min but I couldn't find it... I went to the front desk asking about the bus but the guy behind the counter doesn't speak English (and I don't speak Spanish). After guesturing for what felt like an eternity, he decided to get the girl from the back that can speak a bit of English. I inquired about the bus that was supposed to leave soon and she said the next bus won't be in for another 2 hours. I was like \"\ud83d\ude33\"! I told her I saw the schedule online and there's supposed to be a bus that's leaving soon. She told me it must have been an old schedule. I knew I didn't have enough cash for a taxi so I asked if there's an ATM around and she said no. I asked if I can use credit card for taxi, she said no. It was at that time where I started to panic.  I knew if I don't get my ass in some kind of motor vehicle soon I will miss my flight and I actually don't have enough cash for taxi fare to the airport. I told the girl I only have $25 on me and I'm pretty sure I said something like \"OMG...what the hell am I gonna do...I'm gonna miss my flight!!!\ud83d\ude31\". I think she felt sorry for me and led me outside to the taxi stand and help negotiated with the taxi drivers to take me to the airport for $25 as opposed to the usual $35. Thankfully, a lady taxi driver felt sorry enough for me and took me to the airport for only $25.  The ride to the airport was just as wild but that's a story for another day. :P\n\nThe moral of this story is to make sure you bring emergency cash and don't be a cheap ass like me. Ever since that incident, I brought $200 extra on all of my trips and research the availabilities of ATMs of my destination.",

(I feel like it's so rude-american to go on a long-planned trip to another country and not even try the most basics of the language.

He got really close to me but I didn\u2019t say anything as to not be rude. Two minutes later he leaves and as he\u2019s walking away, the music starts to cut out. By the time I realized what had happened, the vendor was long gone. Fast forward 45 minutes later. I\u2019m at the different spot in the beach, and from afar, I recognize the same vendor because he had a distinctive Coca Cola cooler. I grab all my shit quickly, and start to speed walk towards him. By the time he realizes it\u2019s me, I\u2019m pretty close to him. At this point, we\u2019re both speed walking lol when he suddenly hides in the midst of beach tents.

Did you ask \"Hotela Zona?\" She said \"no, but we will just sit on the bus till it goes to the hotels.\" My mom, I love her but she is the first one to point out \"ugly American\" traits but doesn't see when she does them herself. The bus stops for a guy in mime facepaint to come on the bus he starts walking up and down the isle telling jokes in Spanish and holding his hat out for tips he sees us and must of said \"these tourists are in for a ride\" because the whole bus got in a laughing fit. It's late afternoon and I said we have to get off at the next stop. Welp we are whisked off onto the highway. The glitz and glam of cancun fading in the distant our first spot was in front of a few 3 story buildings no windows no doors you could see people sleeping on the roof the road was dirt and if I was by myself I may have gone to get help but my mom had convinced me that all busses go in loops. I said if we were not going to get off the bus at least we could move closer to the driver and ask. Groups of 3 and 4 were getting off at each stop and about 2 hours later in the pitch black we had moved up behind the driver who when i talked would gesture \"one minute\" to me. We were the last ones on the bus exhausted and starving. The bus driver pulls in front of a graveyard and looks at us and shrugs his shoulders. Us not knowing any Spanish outside of courtesy words spun my finger in a circle \"loop?\" He says \"no loop, end\" omg what are we going to do. He rubs his fingers together asking for fare money I go to grab my wallet and my mom said \"no we will pay when he gets us to the hotel what are we doing in front  of a graveyard\" I wanted to strangle her. Luckily the driver called his supervisor and handed me the phone the lady was so kind and literally said \"yeah you paid till the end of the line so pay him 60 pesos to go back\" at this time 60 pesos was like 3 dollars. We paid and he drove us directly to our exact hotel. We gave him something like another 200 or 300 pesos  apologizing the whole way. Lesson learned: Don't get onto a random bus. Don't listen to My mom ever ever. Same women who got us on the wrong tram in Germany but luckily that thing moved back and forth",

Might as well recover some cash on my shopping, right? The queue moves glacially. I finally reach the counter and the inspection officer asks for my ticket.\n\nThe time is now 12.35. All this while, I've been thinking that my flight leaves at 1.55. I've done a web checkin and know that I have till 12.55 to drop my bags off. While handing the ticket over, I glance at it and realize to my horror that my flight doesn't leave at 1.55 as I had been confidently thinking all this while, but at 12.55. I now have twenty minutes left to drop my bag, pass through immigrations, and board a 9 hour international flight.  \n\nI run like I've never run before to the check-in counters and plead with the only staff member there. She says she cannot help me since I've already been offloaded. I keep requesting her - anything, get my bag on another flight and let me board this one yada yada - until I see the plane itself taxiing away. I then ask her to help me reschedule. Turns out I can't reschedule my flight since I booked it using miles, and they've all been forfeited. So I end up booking a fresh ticket to get back home. I'm still trying to see if I can wiggle out atleast a mileage refund, but it looks unlikely seeing how I was the one to blame for this idiotic turn of events.\n\nI was trying to pocket 1500 ZAR in the VAT refund queue (which I did now that I had to spend an extra 5 hours at the airport), and ended up spending 11000 ZAR. The saving grace was that I didn't really 'waste' money as much as miles that I'd collected for free. While it would have been good to be able to use the miles, I'm half glad that I didn't spend twice.\n\nLike the OP, I pride myself on being a meticulous planner, so this whole fuck-up was a slap in my face of sorts. I was upset for a bit, but then began to see the humour in it (a beer by the gate helped for sure). Its a tale I'll be telling at many parties and dates, going forward.",

The layover in Las Vegas was about 8 hours and I hadn\u2019t  been there in 10 years (I\u2019m 22 now) so of course I went to the strip to pass by the time. I don\u2019t really like to spend money if don\u2019t have to , I saw the bus was going to just take 40 minutes from the airport and just went through there , I had a carry on me and my backpack. I was exhausted by the time I got to the strip but I still enjoyed my time and continued on with my bags. I noticed I was the only one with luggage, anyways by the end of the night I was going to go back to the airport by the bus it was about 10pm and my flight was in 2 hours , I had to walk through a relatively empty street to get there and was watching my phone and a man wearing all dark walked up to me and pointed what looked to be a gun at me and demanded me to give him all my stuff . I don\u2019t know if it was the white claws I had drinken the whole time there but I didn\u2019t even react or say anything and just instantly ran , I ran across the street and kept running and when I looked back I saw he was at the same spot and didn\u2019t even follow after . I quickly flagged down a taxi and payed for it, it didn\u2019t even really hit me until I was on the plane and I was just reflecting the whole time. But it was one of the scariest thing to happen to me . Also I was wearing AirPods while I was walking which distracted me and while I ran away I managed to drop an AirPod. But it could\u2019ve been worse . Now I know not to go cheap especially when your carrying luggage on you , it\u2019s always safer to Uber at night . And to always be vigilant. Also because of this Reddit page I\u2019ve learned about luggage lockers so now I know to use those . On my way back I stopped at New York for 3 days and was more aware of my surroundings and had a safer experience. But yea my fucked up moment was me being a cheapskate",

My last intl flight, it had taken 3 hours to get home from IAD. \n\nSo I found a ticket from BWI to Berlin thru Play Airlines, for only $1000 and asked to book and be reimbursed. I'm feeling great about it, plan to pick up my friend on the way who will drive me to the airport and then borrow the car and pick me up after my trip.\n\nWell, there was a bike race planned for that day, in my head I completely mixed up times and thought the whole race was going to happen after I already left for the airport. I was literally scoffing at people being annoyed about road closures.\n\nI ended up completely unable to get from my side of the city to her side because the race went right down the middle (we each only lived a few blocks from that street). I spent over an hour driving around and getting stuck again when streets that weren't blocked off on the race map were in real life. \n\nFinally I had to go a completely different way out of the city on a toll road (gave up and left her behind). I sped to the airport, parked in the closest most expensive parking, and got super lucky with an immediate shuttle. Got to the airport 45 mins before my flight.\n\nWell, this airline doesn't have that many flights out of BWI and shuts the counter 1 hour before the last flight out (mine). I was supposed to stay for more than a week (added a vacation weekend) so I had a checked bag. If it was just a carry on I could have made it onto the plane with my  pre-check. If my friend had been with me I could have checked that bag back in the car. I couldn't get back to the parking lot to drop it and get back to the flight in time.\n\nI had to pay $500 for a ticket on the last flight going to Berlin that night thru Istanbul. Out of IAD after all, so another $80 for an Uber over there. Then my second flight from Istanbul-Berlin was delayed 3 hours (the ONLY delayed flight at the airport). Missed the whole first day of the conference. The best part was the people who invited me cancelled the session we were supposed to present on while I was on the first flight (bc the conf had moved it to a different day when others couldn't join). Somehow some of them hadn't gotten the memo that I was FLYING THERE. The second best part was that I lost my keys somewhere along the trip and when I got back to the BWI parking lot in the rain discovered that panicked previous me had left my window down.\n\nLike others said, it's a story to tell. Oh and the one bright spot was that I sat next to a guy on my delayed Istanbul-Berlin flight that works in my field, knew my boss, and the next time I went thru Istanbul took me to dinner. Crazy.",

            "comment": "I was in the airport checking in for my flight to Vietnam for a trip with my friend. While in the process of checking in, the airline counter employee informed me that I could not board at the time due to a mismatch in the expiration date of my passport and the one listed on my visitor visa for Vietnam. (I had a typo on the application!) They suggested getting an express e-visa that would maybe come in 24hrs (my flight was departing in 2 hours).\n\nI was so anxious and upset at myself, I was trying to do a million things at once. I looked into express visas, found a number to call, and they said they weren't doing them during Covid. I tried to contact the Vietnam embassy, it was outside business hours. I emailed them instead for support. Boarding time was approaching, in tears I tell my friend to go ahead without me so she wouldn't miss the flight too. \n\nI went back to the check-in counter and asked if I could switch flights to a later date (so I could have time to receive a new visa).  They couldn't modify anything since I had booked through a different carrier than directly through them. So I went to my reservations online, to try to see if I could modify my flight. Had to get in contact with customer support, where they don't have any representatives to talk to but bots who had no clue what I was trying to do. I was crying throughout all of this, and so embarrassed at the same time, and under this time crunch knowing my flight was leaving soon. \n\nThe airline manager waves me over at this point (45 minutes until boarding) and explains that he could write a letter notifying the airline that my visa was incorrect, and if I was turned away at the Da Nang airport, that I would be responsible for finding and paying for my flight back. He told me to apply again for my e-visa but with the correct dates.  I agreed, so happy that I would at least be allowed to board my flight. I run to security, trying to fill out another application at the same time. I make it to last call for boarding, and submit my new visa application as I'm arriving to the gate. \n\nWhen we get to the Da Nang airport, my friend informs me that per her mom (who is from Vietnam), to put in a $20 bill in my passport and bribe the Vietnamese immigration officers if they give me a hard time with the wrong information on my Visa. I feel so nervous about this, as now I have the anxiety of being thrown into jail for attempting to bribe an immigration officer. So I decided to keep it on standby in my pocket. As I get to the counter, the officer is stone-faced and intimidating. I hand in my passport with shaky hands. And without even asking for my visa, he lets me through! \n\nMy new visa ended up arriving in my email 2 weeks later...so happy they let me in. \n\nAnother time, while traveling in Italy, my friend and I could not figure out how to open the front door of our Airbnb near Venice. We had arrived at around 11pm. Tried to contact the Airbnb owner, could not get a hold of him. Contacted Airbnb support, who said they would send a a taxi to bring us to a hotel, which never came. We ended up laying out our sarongs on the porch and attempted to sleep. In the morning, we asked a neighbor for help opening the door and she easily unlocked the door for us with our key. \n\nTraveling can feel so stressful at a baseline, and when there are bumps on the road it feels upsetting and anxiety-provoking. I find comfort in knowing that in a couple weeks, couple months, a couple years, that this memory will provoke a chuckle. It's all part of the adventure! Don't be too hard on yourself, things like this happen and will probably continue to happen, but in the end does it really matter? Did anyone die? Every change in plans opens the door for something new and unexpected. Exploring, meeting new people, etc... Yes you missed your Euro Train opportunity. But you're still alive and breathing, everything will be ok! Enjoy the rest of your trip :)",

Lost that money I had already paid and had to wander the streets looking for a hostel that had a bed that night. I was very close to sleeping in a park. \n\nAnother time in NYC i had a flight to Montreal for a family reunion. It got rained out and they rebooked everyone on a flight the next morning. I went back to my friend\u2019s house and slept through the next morning\u2019s flight. Thankfully, they were kind about it since they were the ones who had changed my itinerary in the first place. \n\nAnother time in Copenhagen, I missed my flight home to San Francisco cause I couldn\u2019t find the train to get from the city to the airport. I was running around the station like a mad person but couldn\u2019t find any signs. Little did I know it was two levels down. Got to the checkin just minutes after they closed it. That was an expensive mistake. Had to book a new flight, the original was non refundable, and had to book emergency lodging for the night. \n\nAnother time in Santiago, I got complacent and felt too confident and safe. It was night time and I wasn\u2019t walking with my phone zipped up in my pocket and I didn\u2019t have my pepper spray in my hand ready to go. I was attacked from behind. They wrestled me to the ground and tried to get my phone but I was gripping my pocket and didn\u2019t stop screaming (even though that was arguably dangerous as they could have stabbed me or something) and strangers started coming toward us to help me. They ran away with just a fancy looking bag I had been carrying. They didn\u2019t know the bag was just my leftovers from dinner. \n\nIt sucks HARD when a mistake costs you extra money, especially when your budget is tight. It feels like close to the end of the world, or damages your sense of security in the world, or at least it does for me. But ultimately, when I look back on bad mistakes that screwed me up in one way or another, I learned lessons from each of them that stay with me to this day. Would I have liked to just know things and not have to go through those experiences to learn those lessons? Absolutely. But a lesson rarely sticks as hard as it does if you\u2019ve experienced pain from it. And looking back, the inconveniences fade and don\u2019t feel as bad anymore, but the lessons are as sharp and important as they were the next day.\n\nTLDR the pain fades and you eventually feel better; the lessons stay with you",

I felt something touch my pocket but figured it was just because i was squeezing past a lot of people so I didn\u2019t think much of it. not even ten seconds later I feel no weight in my pocket and boom phone was stolen. we immediately used find my on my friends phone to track it down but ended up in a residential area and we couldn\u2019t get in. police were no help either so I went the rest of my two weeks without a phone (always stuck with friends) very dumb of me",

We got drunk and went tubing down the river for a final goodbye and I forgot about it. Crossing the boarder into Canada they pulled me aside and asked for permission to search. Of course I said go for it and was cracking jokes as I sat down behind the table in the garage they pull you into. Guy searched for maybe 7 seconds and walked off. Saw him walking back with 4 other officers and a dog and that\u2019s when it hit me.  Detained me for about 4 hours and had me handcuffed to a chair for international drug smuggling. Then the free lawyer I was appointed wouldn\u2019t answer his phone so they let me kick it with them for a bit. Luckily after about 2 hours of hanging out and chatting they decided it wasn\u2019t worth any of our time to continue and they gave me a big ol fine and let me carry on my way.  Finally got to my campsite late as hell that night to realize we booked it for the night after and the lot was full.  Was a very memorable trip. Just got to Alaska last week and have been having a blast since! Worth the hassles for good memories and stories! For the grandkids someday lol",

Well, I spent a whole morning trying to see if there was a card issue, etc. only to realize, I can't book there and need to book on Trainline.  Anyway, as I was booking via Trainline, I realized I had entered the wrong dates and was so grateful that I COULDN'T buy the ticket (though, at the time I was super pissed as I was in s bit of a panic). So, I made a mistake, but was supremely lucky.\n\nI would feel gutted had I goofed.  Travelling is expensive enough and mistakes can be costly (in my case it was 4 tickets)...so I hear you on feeling devastated.    That said, I bet it will never happen again to you.

One night I was falling asleep in bed searching in a Chinese travel app, with my Chinese being pretty good but still not native (I'm from the US). Suddenly out of nowhere I came across an amazing nonstop flight from my city that I'd never seen before, everything looked so perfect about it, price right on point, the whole bit. I went for it right away. Miracle in the books!\n\nNext morning I checked my email and saw confirmation details for \"your flight to Kuala Lumpur.\"\n\nIn Chinese, the names for Singapore\uff0c\u65b0\u52a0\u5761 (xinjiapo)\uff0cand Kuala Lumpur\uff0c\u5409\u9686\u5761 (jilongpo) are both three characters and both end in \u5761 po. Probably just as important as that the flight time looked right, too.\n\nOops.\n\nObviously I felt like a dumbo and panicked a bit, but then I thought through it and, long story short, I've been back to KL multiple times and absolutely love it. There are dozens and dozens of CHEAP 55 minute flights between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore every day, so I just flew in and out of KL before and after visiting my friends in Singapore.",

            "comment": "I was once passing through London for a few days on a round the world ticket. I happened to have an old high school friend living there, so we met up and they very kindly let me stay at their place. One night we were casually looking at each other's passports and the stamps in them, joking about not mixing them up as we carefully put them away. \n\nWhen I got to the airport, waiting in line, I noticed a sticker on the back of my passport which I didn't remember seeing before and thought, hmm that's weird, but it was a fleeting thought, which barely registered. I got through security at the line up and went to check in my big suitcases, which is when I noticed what had happened. WE HAD SOMEHOW STILL MANAGED TO SWITCH OUR PASSPORTS BY ACCIDENT. \n\nThis prickly sense of horror spread through my body and I realised that since we look passably similar, the security person hadn't noticed. But now I was about to check in on an international flight, with a passport which didn't match my ticket. To make matters worse, my friend was at work, their first day in a new, promoted position. I was immediately wracked with panic, then guilt as I had to call them and ask if we could possibly meet somewhere, then panic again as I only had about 2 hours maximum until check-in would close. \n\nThe fastest meeting point would be if we both caught trains to Piccadilly station which would give me just enough time to get there, swap the passports, get back and check in my bags, as long as I could run every chance I got and all trains ran to schedule. This propelled me into action. I had to find a spot for my suitcases as I could not check them in since I didn't have my passport. This was about 15 years ago, so mobile internet wasn't so much of a thing to just easily look things up quickly, either. I raced around, asking for directions as I went along, found the luggage storage place, paid, dumped my stuff and sped as fast as I could to the train ticket window while my friend made their way from work to the meet-up station. \n\nOnce we met up and they walked me to the platform to get the train back to Heathrow, my friend was insisting they get me a bagel for the ride but the train was already at the station and I was anxious about missing it. They were confident that there would be an announcement but I wasn't so sure so I said I'd go down the platform and check what time it was leaving. They went the opposite direction toward the bagel place.\n\nAs I was walking, I noticed that there was nobody left on the platform and there was someone motioning for people to get on. I looked back and my friend was way off in the distance, so I got on the train, leaning out the open door to try to see if they had noticed what was going on. Just as I spotted them making their way down the platform, the announcements started in a sudden flurry, along with the noises the train made as it got ready to go. I was waving at them, trying to let them know I had got on, that the train was going to leave the station, then I saw that they noticed and had started running. \n\nWhen my friend approached my car, a final warning sounded and the doors began sliding closed in front of me, fully closing just as my friend banged up against the glass, paper bag filled with my bagel, clutched in their hand. It was too late. I mouthed thank you through the glass, and motioned for them to eat it instead. We stood there like that, doing an awkward smiling goodbye, until the train slowly began to move out and away. That was the last time I saw that friend, and I will never forget their disappointed little face that I didn't get to try the amazing bagels. \n\nWe did remember to switch our passports back though, and I made my flight with about ten minutes to spare.",

It was 2018 during mass protests in Algeria, and I was eager leave (despite loving Algeria, there was a safety concern\u2026like tear gas coming into my hotel from police/demonstrator clashes). \n\nOnce I got to the airport, I was told by Royal Air Maroc that some of the contents of my carry on couldn\u2019t be checked, and in my frazzled state I agreed to let them check the whole bag all the way to Nouakchott. Not five minutes later, I realized that I had left all of my cash in the unlocked bag I just checked, which was to sit in the notorious Casablanca airport for a day. I spent an anxious day in Casablanca (being hassled by touts all the while) and boarded my flight to Nouakchott. \n\nUpon arriving in Nouakchott well after midnight, I had the lucky distinction of being last to disembark the plane, and therefore at the end of the visa on arrival line. After about 90 minutes, I made it to the baggage claim to find only my bags slowly circling the carousel. Wrapped in all plastic and looking like they\u2019d been through the blender. Sure enough, the cash was gone. I had no cash for a week in Mauritania. \n\nGo to the atm, you say? Well unfortunately, there were no working foreign atm card machines in Nouakchott, so I did not have access to\nmy funds. \n\nIn the end, though, the hospitality of the Mauritanian people showed through. I was allowed to Western Union money to my guide, pay my hotel tariff upon returning to the states. To reduce costs even further, I was able to hitch a ride to the desert with a French couple over landing through West Africa. I\u2019m happy to say I made lifelong friends during that trip, and even returned last year to visit with my guide, Limam, and his family. \n\nAlso: Don\u2019t fly Royal Air Maroc",

We didn\u2019t see a departure time printed on our tickets, but saw a \u201cllegada\u201d (arrival) time. We thought it was strange that the ticket showed the time the train arrived at the station instead of showing the departure time, but figured they must just do things differently in Spain. As we relaxed waiting for our \u2018llegada\u2019 time which was over an hour away, we hear them continuously announcing on the loud speaker that the train was leaving and there were still ticketed passengers missing. We laughed about how if someone missed that many warnings, they deserved to miss their train. After the train left, I noticed there was nobody left waiting on the train station and that seemed odd. Then, it dawned on me that WE were the passengers that they were trying to prevent from missing the train! \u2018Llegada\u2019 was just as it is here - the time of arrival at the DESTINATION, not the train platform. Fortunately the tickets were pretty cheap because they wouldn\u2019t exchange them and we had to buy tickets again for the next train.",

I needed a picture for the form which was 300, I had it but it was in my checked luggage. I had no idea they don't give you checked luggage until you get the visa. Not only this but the visa fee was 2200 not 2k. There was NO ATM in that area, ATMs were at the other side, WTF .I am sitting there looking at Vietnamese, Korean and Chinese people around. No Indian. I couldn't ask anyone for help because there was no way I could pay them back. I gathered myself and asked one girl for help and she refused. I was okay until this but that refusal somehow just made me extremely sad and I went to the washroom and cried. I come back and the cleaning lady is shouting at me. She is doing some actions and I realized I fucked up again. I left my hand bag in the washroom. I went back, took it and finally the incharge had called a guard who could take me to the other side to get some cash. The whole time I didn't panic even once like I would a few months back but that one rejection just broke my willpower. I mean, I help people all the time. There is no chance I won't help someone even if they are a complete stranger. Also, my bad, I should have asked more people. But, seriously, HELP people if you can. Not everyone is trying to scam you.",

Thankfully she had a good grip cuz i still feel bad today, 8yrs later knowing if she hadn't got a good grip, then she would have lost all of those photos and videos with no chance to replace them like a week before the end of the trip.

As it were, the AirBnb was booked for one single day right after my initial two, but was free again afterwards, so I frantically started looking for accommodation for that one night. There was none on the price range, NONE. I nearly had a breakdown. Thankfully the host came up with a solution and saved my ass out of goodwill (basically, they gave up their own room to this idiot and they went to sleep at a friend's). I'll be forever grateful to them.\n\nThat said, screwing up dates/times is my #1 travel nightmare (hasn't happened, yet...). Sympathies for OP.",

I had to pick a specific checkpoint to cross the border, so I just chose one at random.\n\nFast forward to the day I was supposed to cross, I hop on the minivan that's supposed to take me to the bus station. The driver asks me if I have my visa, I say yes but it's still the old one. Apparently, I can only fill for a visa online and I can't do it at the border. I explain my situation to the guy who runs the bus company and thankfully, he was able to hook me with one of his guys who was willing to take me to the other checkpoint. I leave Phnom Penh the next day at 5AM and spend effectively the entire day on multiple buses before reaching Ho Chi Minh City, so I lose a whole day of travel because I chose the wrong checkpoint.\n\nRemember: if you take the bus between Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh City, the border checkpoint is Moc Bai.",

    "postText": "I'm probably in the minority here, but I can't stand people who play guitar in the hostel - especially those who bring their own. People don't play their music playlist on a Bluetooth speaker out in the common area, because that'd be rude and inconsiderate, but why is acceptable for people to play the guitar? Sometimes they can also sing, so they do, or someone who sings would join in. The solo travellers who bring their own guitar is so baffling to me, it's such a cumbersome instrument to carry across the world, backpacking - and if they're travelling by themselves, staying at hostels, did they bring it for my benefit? I certainly didn't request it. Or is it to get a bit of an ego boost?",

It's usually a guy with a topknot who barely knows a few songs and wants to impress a girl.\n\nThe truth is I like to have my guitar because I like to play guitar. It's a good way to vent anxiety and chill out. Mostly I just play in my room. I would never bring it into a main area unprompted. My rule is to never play in front of people unless they ask me to.\n\nI've had a few impromptu concerts and singalongs that were amazing fun.

The guitar is passed around to other, less skilled people before being returned to him. People are half-heartedly singing along to Wonderwall\n\nArgentinian dude half his age walks in, sees that there's a musical get together and after two songs asks if he can play. Old guy is only too happy to give him the guitar, while telling him how to hold it and not to expect to be as good as him, it takes years of practice. The Argentinian picks up the guitar and starts playing an amazing tango. Suddenly there's movement in the room, people are clapping along and even dancing. They're requesting songs and the guy seems to know them all. Except all dude doesn't like being upstaged so he takes back his guitar and everyone goes back to being indifferent to the music.",

He sat and softly played his guitar on the front porch and got up to process guests coming and going. It was very welcoming. When I stayed in a Los Angeles hostel, there was a community guitar there and we all passed it around teaching each other the basics. That was spur of the moment, socially inclusive, and an amazing ice breaker. To this day one of my favorite hostel memories and makes me want a guitar at home now. I\u2019ve yet to encounter the loud player showing off at inappropriate times but I do imagine that would get on many people\u2019s (probably even mine) nerves.",

I like hearing people sing even if they\u2019re bad at it, because it\u2019s still a way of sharing yourself with people. And when I\u2019ve asked people to quiet down a bit so others can sleep, they do. Hating a guitar player is like hating someone for dancing in public. That person is enjoying themselves in a moment when maybe we aren\u2019t able to express ourselves so openly for whatever reason, or our hobby isn\u2019t the type we can share.

            "comment": "As a person who plays guitar in hostels, I hope this perspective can help answer any questions. \n\nWhen I decided to solo travel for many years, I sold everything: including my guitar at the time. But three months in, I realized that was a big mistake. My couchsurfing host in Berlin had a guitar and we spent the evening playing back and forth (after she brought me to some anarchist squats around the city, which was fucking amazing). I forgot how important making music was to me, how therapeutic and expressive it is. So when I left her place and saw a music shop, I bought myself a 120euro guitalini. \n\nI traveled with this for many more months while staying at hostels, and while doing work exchange (which often included hostels). I began writing my own music, and opted to play guitar on my shift instead of playing the radio or spotify (while sitting at the desk of course). Every night, when we would all be relaxing, people would literally beg me to play for them, but my belief has always been that music is for sharing. So we would often pass my guitar around a circle, and give everyone a chance to play covers or originals. Two songs, pass. Two songs pass. It was always a wonderful experience.  \n\nSo wonderful, in fact, that when I was in Ukraine, I traded in my guitilini and bought a full fledged Trembita guitar. I will say this has been one of my best decisions, and I still have this guitar today. It has traveled with me over 4 years, through 40 countries, has been played in countless hostels and music circles (I even began hosting couchsurfing events at hostels called \"Living Room Concerts\" where people from all over the world would come and play their favorite songs for us). I've also taken it across two long distance hiking trails: Orzagos Kektura in Hungary (700 miles), and El Camino Del Norte in Spain (500 miles); the latter I made the whole way simply by busking. Yes, as an additional 7 pounds, it was heavy. Yes, it was worth every ounce because:\n\nThe benefits of traveling with a guitar, that I've witnessed, have been wonderful. \n\n1.It is a way to connect to other people, as music is something very special to everyone. It brings people together in community.\n\n2. It is a way to share individual cultures. As the one who has the instrument, I have been blessed to be able to hear so many cultures different music tastes because most people who do play guitar don't travel with one, but they would love to play. So they play mine. \n\n3. It is a fantastic ice breaker. People will come listen to me play at hostels, cafes or bars, or on the street, and will start up a big conversation about it. \n\n4. It helps me, and others, feel emotions. Everytime I play, listeners will cry, and thank me for my songs. This, for me, is the greatest compliment and affirmation to my personal style. It also helps me process difficult emotional feelings, as music always has for me. \n\n\n\n\nI could go on, but I'd like to say here that there are, of course, appropriate and inappropriate times to play. Early morning or after everyone's gone to bed? Inappropriate. Mid afternoon, or early evening? A great time to take out the old git-fiddle. If there's a space where no one will hear me, such as a common room away from dorms, I'll often play there. If someone is in there reading or something, I first ask if they wouldn't mind. \n\nAnd lastly, I guess it depends on the skill of the player. Terrible singers who just string mash all their chords, I probably don't want to listen to. A musician who knows how to play beautifully, I have been known to sit near enough to listen, close my eyes, and go to a place. \n\nAs a long term traveler, and as someone who feels the entire world through musical experience, i cant give it up. But I always try to be respectful. \n\nHope this explanation helps you some. \n\n\n\nTL/DR:\n\nTraveling and playing a musical instrument has numerous benefits to most people. Just make sure you play at the right times, and ask people if it's alright.\n\n*Edit* thanks for the award!!",

Expecting someone to say \"no, you can't play guitar\" in an environment where people want to be liked and look easy going and not like they're someone's stiff mum? Now *that's* unrealistic.\n\nIn such a social public setting people will rather endure some dude singing Wonderwall than seem like someone who is not \"fun-loving\" and tolerant. \n\nAnd heck, social perception aside people tend to want to be nice and will say \"yes\" so that you can have your fun, despite personally not actually wanting it. \n\n\n&gt; oh, I guess you deleted that part of your comment for some reason without leaving an edit note.\n\nMy bad, I edited it out within two minutes so reckoned that was fine without leaving a note.

I would be worried about my guitar getting smashed or stolen in a party hostel. But overall I enjoy group singalongs when everyone gets a turn or gets involved. If it's just one guy trying to show off though by playing mediocre covers then they can fuck off though. Singalong should be about everyone being happy together (damn that sounded hippie).",

I personally get really bored when traveling if I\u2019m not learning something/ getting better at something everyday. And there\u2019s so much time when traveling that it\u2019s great for dedicating yourself to something that brings you joy, whether it\u2019s surfing, learning a language, reading, social skills, perspective or an instrument",

    "postText": "Easter Island (Rapa Nui) was truly one of the most amazing places I've ever visited and I would love to go back there someday - 5 days was not enough.\r  \n\r  \nThere is a process to get to Easter Island, although fairly simple. Here are a few things to know ahead of time:\r  \n\r  \nIt's a 5-hour direct flight from Santiago, Chile.\r  \n\r  \nYou have to fill out the online *Formulario de Ingreso a Rapa Nui* (Rapa Nui Entry Form) (IRN). I printed the form out after submitting it, although this turned out to not be necessary. You go through a special line at the airport in Santiago and they look up your passport in their database - they know if you have submitted the form.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://ingresorapanui.interior.gob.cl/\r  \n\r  \nYou have to have reserved accommodations that are registered with the National Tourism Service (SERNATUR). This was stated very clearly with the AirBnB that I booked.\r  \n\r  \nYou have to have an official guide to visit any of the archaeological sites that are within the National Park, which is about half of the island. It's best to buy an entry ticket for the National Park ahead of time (about US $80), which can be done online: \r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.rapanuinationalpark.com/pages/compra-de-tickets\r  \n\r  \nPrint out the ticket and always have it with you. There are entry stations at each of the major archaeological sites and they will stamp it there.\r  \n\r  \nHanga Roa is the only town, its small but there are lots of shops and restaurants, a good place to buy souvenirs. Internet is extremely limited throughout the island, but there is a little caf\u00e9 on the main street that has great wi-fi. It's called La creperia Rapa Nui, the food and service are great, and the tropical juices are so refreshing in the hot weather.\r  \n\r  \nSome of the top sites to see:\r  \n\r  \nOrongo: old ceremonial site where the bird man contest took place each year to choose a new leader. It is located on a high cliff, right next to the Rano Kau volcanic crater. A small trail runs around the top of the crater.\r  \n\r  \nRano Raraku: a spectacular quarry where all of the moais (the carved heads) were carved, then transported around the island. There is a 2-kilometer trail that winds through the quarry, past lots of partially carved moais. You really appreciate having a guide here because every moai has its own story.\r  \n\r  \nOne thing I didn't know before I got there: there are more than 800 moais that form a circle around the island. ALL OF THEM were knocked over about 300 years ago during a period of inter-tribal warfare. The ones you see in photos have been restored by archaeologists in the past 50 years.\r  \n\r  \nTongariki: this is the largest restored platform, with 15 moais. It is an amazing place to watch the sunrise. You need a guide with transportation, because it is about 15 kilometers outside of Hanga Roa. My guide threw a bicycle in the back of her pickup and I rode the 15 kilometers back to town after sunrise, past big herds of horses and lots of old fallen moais and platforms along the coast.\r  \n\r  \nAnakena: on the northern coast of the island, this is the beach where the Rapanui people first landed 1,000 years ago. It is spectacular, with a large platform that has 4 moais. There are also several small restaurants, the best ceviche I've ever had anywhere in the world.\r  \n\r  \nTahai: just north of Hanga Roa, easy walking distance. A platform with 5 moais and a single one by itself, this is the place to watch the amazing sunsets.\r  \n\r  \nThere is an excellent guidebook that is available on the island in both English and Spanish. A Companion to Easter Island, by James Grant-Peterkin.\r  \n\r  \nThe Rapanui people are very warm and friendly, although not many people speak English. The island is part of Chile, so everybody speaks Spanish and about half the people speak the Polynesian language of Rapa Nui. Two important words in Rapa Nui will be greatly appreciated:\r  \n\r  \nIorana: hello, goodbye, how are you? good morning - this is the Easter Island equivalent of aloha.\r  \n\r  \nM\u0101uru-uru: thank you",

            "comment": "Great to see this trip report, but my, I guess things have changed! I went in 2012 and there was no guide requirement. At least there are Airbnb options now - I remember staying at a hostel/campground, I wonder if it still exists. I remember having to cook an awful lot of spaghetti and packaged sauces for lack of food options.\n\nLooks like the lack of transport to Tongariki and Anakena persists though! Back then, with my cheap rental bike, I still had to hitchhike to both cause of the distances.",

The other sites you could see multiple times.",

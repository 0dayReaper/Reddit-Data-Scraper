    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nPlanning a trip to the Dominican Republic for the fall, might go solo might go with a friend.\n\nWondering what this sub's recommendation is for what region to stay in. \n\nI'd go for 7-10 days, and I love a mix of beach/pool days and sightseeing/adventure days. \n\nSamana looks like the best beaches, but a little further away from anything else. Punta Cana looks like a good mix between beaches, nightlife, and adventure excursions. Santo Domingo is the big city with interesting landmarks and the best nightlife, but not the best beaches.\n\nWould you guys recommend splitting time between these locations, or staying in a particular spot? Will probably go the airbnb route as it seems to be the best bang for the buck.",

Punta Cana is more for all-inclusives/resorts; perhaps you can go on a day trip to Saona Island, but usually you go with a tour instead of an \"adventure\". Santo Domingo is a historical city. Hoyo Azul is impressive, but around Santo Domingo, the beaches are not that great (avoid Boca Chica for sure).",

Your best bet to stay at would be Las Terrenas, since it has way more places to hang out than the less developed Las Galeras.",

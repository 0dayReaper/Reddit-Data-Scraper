I suppose I can't give advice purely based on how I myself function.\n\nOP, if you're listening, and you are someone who needs time to adjust to jetlag, my advice is to push the whole schedule back a day or two before you rent the car, and take the ferry from Auckland CBD to Waiheke Island. Auckland is a decent city but doesn't have much unique to offer if you're from any moderate-sized American city. (And, based on your itinerary, I gather you aren't that interested anyway). Waiheke is a big beautiful island full of wineries, so it's a great place to relax and adjust to the timezone.",

I mean, yes, at most I could take a day to \"recover,\" but there's no way I can waste \"a few days\" just walking around AKL to get used to jetlag, time is tight as it is. I had thought about the driving on the other side of the road though.  I don't have any experience there, but it's going to be baptism by fire in this case. I'll just have to be extra careful and take my time. I'm also a pretty good driver. &lt;knocks on wood&gt;",

If you can add a day in Auckland to recover and take it off Queenstown (really a couple of days in Queenstown is enough with everything else you're seeing) you'll be much better off.\n\nThe drive times always take longer given it's mountain roads, add at least 20% extra on to your estimates and then reconsider if you're happy with the amount of driving. Otherwise I'd consider cutting glaciers and keeping it to Lake Tekapo, Wanaka, Queenstown and Milford Sound.\n\nHave you already booked your flight from Auckland to Queenstown? You'd be better off flying into Christchurch if your first stop is Lake Tekapo.",

I think it's only worth going to glacier country if you intend to go for long hikes or a heli tour to see the glaciers. I regretted the time i spent in the franz josef/fox glacier area because the short hikes led to views from reallyyy far away. Not worth the long drive imo\n\n2. Milford was lovely! Definitely worth going on the cruise but it's very weather dependent. I went in winter so there were days where the roads to milford were closed/the cruises werent operating\n\n3. You should check out the mt cook area! Hooker Valley is a hike that we really enjoyed\n\n4. For wanaka, you might want to consider roy's peak!!",

Instead, I\u2019d check out Mount Cook, where you can see more from some of the short trails or take a glacier boat tour. \n\nI only did an overnight in Lake Tekapo, which honestly was all I needed there.",

Cook and the glacier boat tour, you do all that from the Lake Tekapo side right?  When I googled mapsed Mt. Cook it keeps sending me to Franz Josef, but it seems like the road comes up from the Lake Tekapo area.",

At the risk of sounding very controversial (I\u2019m from the area)- I\u2019d cut out the West Coast in favour of more time to breathe. The township in Aoraki/Mount Cook area is pretty bland and sterile. \n\nThere might be a bus tour down to Hobbiton from Auckland but you\u2019re going to be completely fucked after the flight. We have huge  (and often fatal) accidents every year from tourists who think they\u2019re all good to drive on our windy roads after hopping of a flight- please don\u2019t chance it lol. There\u2019s also a good chance the weather will be shit and it\u2019s never fun driving on a South Island road in shit weather.",

            "comment": "I spent a couple of years working in NZ and took a few two-week trips - I think two weeks is enough time for a good trip on one island. For Hobbiton, I stayed in Rotorua and was on an arranged trip to/from there. Taupo isn't too far away from Rotorua, and you can do the 18km hike around  Mount Ngauruhoe (Mt Doom in LOTR) if that's something you're interested in, although the hike is a lot of hard work, particularly the first third of it.\n\nCan't say too much about Arthur's Pass cos I didn't go there. You can do trips from Milford Sound from Queenstown - it's an early start, but I stayed in Te Anau to go there and there wasn't really too much to do around there. Some of the coach companies from Queenstown stop off along the way to the Mirror Lakes and a few other places that are generally recommended to stop off at. Didn't rate Auckland too much but went to Waiheke Island for a wine tour from there which was great.\n\nFor the bits you've got on in the South Island I'd recommend travelling from Franz Josef (bear in mind that a lot of the helicopter flights get cancelled when visibility is poor, so might want a few back up options here too) down to Wanaka (if you're going to do Roy's Peak look in advance at the dates it's closed for lambing) to Mt Cook (decent hikes) to Tekapo and down to Queensland. May be a bit too much for over a week but hope this helps :)",

            "comment": "Yeah nah it's a lot of driving but honestly you'll be right; the drives are beautiful and just take heaps of breaks. The Glaciers are cool, but mostly worth it if you get a proper tour. It's also heavily weather dependent and you're in the middle of nowhere if things are cancelled.\n\nI'd recommend trading that out for a night in or around Aoraki and doing something like the Hooker Valley Track (3-4 hour tramp). It'll cut down on your overall driving time. There's some great cheap camper spots nearby (Glentanner park from memory). If the weather is bad you can just head to Wanaka early.\n\nHobbiton from Auckland is a biggie, but pretty common day trip. You can probably find an operator that will bus you each way. With the risk of jetlag it could be worth having this as a more managed part of the trip.\n\nSounds like a good trip! You'll have a lot of fun.",

The drive between those two places is very cool.\n\nJust my 2 cents",

You don\u2019t need all that time in QT, one day is more than enough, it\u2019s literally like 4 streets big and very touristy! You should DEFINITELY go to Mount Cook on the way to Tekapo. It\u2019s absolutely stunning, one of my favorite places in the world and home to NZs biggest mountain! You don\u2019t really need to go to glacier county unless you plan on doing a long hike 7 hours up to Alex knob for a proper view. Or if you want to do a proper heli hike. Otherwise it\u2019s not worth going",

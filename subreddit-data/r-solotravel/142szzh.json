    "postText": "I am going to Costa Rica in Mid-June and had a couple of questions.\n\n\\-I have been researching and seeing that it could be rainy during the time I am travelling so I am wondering how bad is the rain usually? Will I still be able to go on hikes, surfing, etc. or is that not the best idea during June?\n\n\\-Do a lot of places accept card/USD or will I need the local currency?\n\nMy rough itinerary is:\n\n\\--3 days in La Fortuna: Hot springs, El Salto, Arenal Volcano.\n\n\\--3 days in Monteverde: Hanging Bridges, Ziplining, Curi Cancha.\n\n\\--1 day Montezuma: Surfing and beach. \n\nThere is two days of traveling from and to the airport that I am not counting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am looking for advice on if there is anything I should add/remove from my itinerary and if anyone has advice on best hostels to stay at to meet people!",

            "comment": "Your Monteverde itinerary can easily be done in 2 days (with plenty of leisure time). Personally I would add another day to the beach, not because I don\u2019t like monteverde but because I think 1 day is not enough to relax. But if you want more Monteverde stuff I think the cloud forest and el tigre waterfall were my favorite things there (I really like hiking/nature). The area is beautiful but the town if Santa Elena itself is nothing special. \n\nI haven\u2019t been to La Fortuna but I\u2019m guessing you would hit Arenal on your way there from Monteverde, do whatever you want there, and then get to La Fortuna (or reverse I suppose). So unless you really love hot springs I would add more stuff or shorten. \n\nIf you do add a beach day, Santa Teresa is very close to Montezuma (~30 min) and is really nice. Honestly if it were me I would stay in Santa Teresa and do a day trip to Montezuma but it depends what kind of vibe you like.",

Crazy thing is food was a bit pricey at restaurants like a good $20-$30 USD for a entree. I walked just a few minutes where the locals ate and I think it was like $5 with a juice included. \n\nI felt safe the entire time. Did a dumb thing and left my bag on top of the bus back from Jaco after a long day. Ended up getting it stolen, but dumb on my part. I would bring some currency and if your staying in a better area most places will take card.",

It usually rains hard at night for shorts bursts \n\n\nYou\u2019ll be totally fine with card in La Fortuna and monteverde. I\u2019ve never been In montezuma, I would carry some colones incase however",

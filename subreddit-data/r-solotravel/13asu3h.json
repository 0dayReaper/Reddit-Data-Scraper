    "postText": "Hello, I am a 22F looking to travel solo to Sydney --&gt; Melbourne! (1-6 Aug in Syd and 6-11 Aus in Melb) I will not be driving sadly so no road trips for me... I have booked hotels near the CBD area and would like to ask for recs about the things to do there or any important things to take note of when travelling solo? From what I heard, the places close early around 5++pm so I was wondering what do people do afterwards.\n\nSince i'm going during the winter season and Aus' winters are unpredictable, i was wondering what do the locals wear during the Aug period? Can i survive with just pullovers and slightly thick jackets?\n\nSo far I have a rough idea of some places I want to visit:\n\nSyd - blue mountain, opera house + boat ride, manly/ bondi beach, fish market\n\nMelb - phillip island (tbc), great ocean road, museums\n\nI am open to more ideas about places that I can visit for sightseeing or any shopping places as the things I planned seem too little for a 10 days trip... pls drop me some food places/cafes/bars recs! :)",

Generally it\u2019s just the retail shops that close at 5pm exception is Thursday which is 9pm and often times a fun experience going at night. \n\n5pm is generally when most workers clock off from work then go home on weekdays. People here work for the weekend which is depressing.\n\nSince you\u2019re from Singapore a warmer climate than Melbourne, I\u2019d say you\u2019ll be okay with what you have and can always buy gloves, beanie, scarf here if you need it. Although I don\u2019t know the effectiveness of your \u201cpullover and slightly thick jackets\u201d.\n\nNote that winter has come earlier this year, tonight was 9-10 degrees.\n\nNightlife here has died in my opinion but if you must, then I would suggest the following:\n- crown casino\n- eat (expensive food festivals/markets)\n- eat (slightly lesser expensive okay tasting food at restaurants you\u2019re better off researching)\n- eat (affordable food which are also delicious, easy to research)\n\nBefore 5pm I would suggest:\n- state library\n- explore (Fitzroy, brunswick, Footscray, CBD, Prahran, and finally Springvale which is great although far from CBD)\n- see some nature (GOR, Dandenong ranges, Werribee gorge, botanical gardens)\n- see a music gig\n- see a stand up show\n- make friends\n\nYou\u2019re welcome to message me for any more advice\n\nYou must visit my favourite place to eat: A1 Bakery (falafel platter, cheese pie, or anything else as you can\u2019t go wrong here)",

    "postText": "TW: sexual assault/harassment \n\n\n\nThis will be just a small rant to get things off my chest and maybe get some sleep. \n\n\nI\u2019m currently on a solo trip in Spain, staying in a nice hotel on a good area. About an hour ago i was picking up food from a nearby restaurant and as i started walking back to my hotel a guy came to me from around the corner and tried to talk to me. He seemed a bit disoriented so i didn\u2019t pay him any attention and just kept walking. He kept talking repeating \u201cun momento\u201d and started following me. Eventually he passed me, got in front of me and pulled out his d*ck. Of course i started yelling at him in every language i know and sped up in hopes to lose him. He kept following and i tried to go walk with a group of people i saw, but they told me not go with them cause they didn\u2019t want this guy to be their problem, which is understandable i guess. Thank god he was intoxicated and couldn\u2019t walk very fast and i got to the hotel without making contact with him again. \n\nBut now i feel bad cause even when my legs were working, my brain was frozen and i forgot i should\u2019ve called police. Like totally forgot police is a thing if it makes sense. \n\nAlso just feel disgusted like why this always happens and what goes on in their heads when doing this, cause it\u2019s not the first time. Two times before this has happened to me, but this was the first time i was completely alone.",

What you wrote it is definitely subtle victim blaming but it is there. You aren't saying OP def did the things she shouldn't have according to you, you explicitly say they may not have. But then you also say maybe she and other travelers with bad experiences wouldn't have been chosen if they had blended in more, hadn't worn those sandals, like that's kinda on them. What if OP had worn those sandals? Should she now be blaming herself? Hell no as far as I am concerned.\n\nThere is always going to be someone for creeps to creep at some point.  Someone who didn't have the option to blend because of the way they look or the way they look at things, who can't walk with a group, who doesn't know exactly where they are going, who has to go out in the dark, who has their drink spiked even when they didn't leave it unattended. Someone who wasn't lucky. \n\nI'm not saying don't worry about being aware of your surroundings. But if someone has a shit experience and talks about it, talking about not doing the 'don't pick me dance' well enough even in general terms or specific (like the sandals) is perpetuating a victim blaming culture and harmful for those (who through no fault of their own) have been harrased, assaulted or worse. And I get it, because we have all grown up learning the 'don't pick me dance' to feel safer, but please don't it on posts like this.",

I booked here (flexible price, I can cancel the reservation). It seems nice, but I read that it's hard to meet up people and it's boring during night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrague: prices are really high! I read that the best ones are The Madhouse and Roadhouse hostel, but they're 50 euros per night. Any suggestion? As of Berlin, I would like hostel with events and where I can meet up people at night. Not necessarely party hostel.",

I still met a bunch of people but it was also NYE so hard not to at that point. \n\nOn Prague, it\u2019s expensive (especially if you\u2019re looking at peak season) - Madhouse is incredible but it is a party hostel - no doubts about that. But it also perhaps does better at pushing a social environment as seamlessly as possible than literally any other hostel I\u2019ve stayed at in my life. You leave there with very very fast friends. But yes, it is pretty party oriented. Don\u2019t have any \u2018in-between\u2019 suggestions alternately for you unfortunately. I think Prague does have a bit of a party city reputation so most hostels tend to cater very much towards that or very much away with less middle ground than I think other cities may have.",

I\u2019m from the US, budget is fairly flexible, and I am planning to go for anywhere from 4 days to a week. This will be my first solo vacation and I\u2019m not sure where to choose (except not NYC). A little about me and what I\u2019m looking for that may help:\n\n-I love learning about new cultures, whether that be in museums or simply experiencing it by visiting a specific town or city \n-I love exercising and running, but I\u2019m afraid of hiking on a remote trail alone as a solo young female\n-I enjoy all types of food and new cuisines \n-I want to feel safe walking around alone and not have to be confined to the hostel or hotel once the sun sets\n-I love nature and swimming but swimming is definitely not a must\n\nIf you have any ideas, I would love to hear them. Thanks so much in advance! And yes i have a passport!\n\nedit: typo",

Backpacking and solo traveling in Europe is common and popular. If you want to meet other travelers, staying at hostels is the best choice.",

Because I narrowed down my choices for my upcoming Paris trip to three studios (after getting over my [anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/13o965b/comment/jl9ligj/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) earlier), which are just a little over $105 per night for my dates.\n\nContext: I'll be arriving at 9:15 PM at CDG, so I may arrive in the city proper at maybe 1.5 hours after because I'll be renting a sim first and figuring out the train system so I won't get lost. \n\n* I'm also contemplating just suffering a red eye and arrive at 8 AM Paris time, but it would be 14 hours of trying-to-sleep hell\n\nFirst up is this studio in [Bastille](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10466472?guests=1&amp;adults=1&amp;s=67&amp;unique_share_id=f98cefed-c41d-4529-abad-1ae860f4f067). \n\nIt's the best one location-wise, but the catch is the check-in is a bit difficult. You have to get the key from a cafe that's approx. 800 meters from the apartment. \n\nNot usually bad since I'm a fit guy, but I'll be arriving at night + with a laptop + wheeled luggage and there's a chance it might rain. I can take a taxi, but I'd rather not. (I also talked to the owner re: firm mattress and she said she fixed it)\n\nThe next two are near each other in Batignolles and are maybe 10%-15% cheaper, but seem to offer just as good if not better amenities because they're not as central as the first one.\n\nThis [one](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/829477575925096624?guests=1&amp;adults=1&amp;s=67&amp;unique_share_id=a9965779-b08a-4d64-a71a-9d577cde2953) has a washer and looks to have bigger space and a better bed. It also allows late check-in because it uses a lockbox. This [one](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/845737265258588920?guests=1&amp;adults=1&amp;s=67&amp;unique_share_id=f8a50bbf-4d75-4cd6-bd7d-3b271a8c09e4) seems to be the most thoughtful in terms of amenities. Check-in is also a little later, but the way she worded is she'd meet me in person.\n\nPS: They all don't have ACs, but since it's in October, I likely shouldn't need them but I'm ready to hear your opinions.",

I want to embark on a 2 week solo trip before I go to Turkey in mid-July to meet up with my girlfriend, but I'm having trouble on where to choose.\n\nIn terms of what I like, I'm really open minded to doing anything but I think my favourite thing to do is just wandering around cities/towns and taking in the culture. One thing that is important for me about this solo trip is that I want to go somewhere that will challenge me culturally. I love Europe but want to go to a country that is not so much like the Western world. Somewhere different, if that makes sense. I'm from Canada for reference. Also, I would appreciate it if I can easily travel to Istanbul after this solo trip.\n\nBecause of this, one of the places I'm considering is Morocco. I feel like its a nice mix between a completely different culture, the desert, and the ocean. However, I want to hear more ideas before I make a decision!\n\nAnyone have suggestions? Thank you :)",

Here's the catch; I'm STUPID poor lol the last 2 days I plan to switch to cheaper accommodations, and somewhere else in the city. So other than any general advice for a solo female traveller in Chicago, specific advice on topics needed below too. Thanks y'all, v excited \ud83d\ude24\n\nCheap accommodations for a solo young woman. Open to location throughout the city but close to public transportation is the biggest plus. Safety in mind of course but I'm not overly concerned about it.  There seem to be a lot of hostels compared to my area (Texas), and I have 0 idea if it's worth it to do that over a cheap motel/hotel. Starting at Hyatt Place O'Hara for the work conference. \n\nPlane/airport tips for first time fliers. \n\nIs the best option for public transportation for 5 days getting a city pass or something? \n\nSmoke shops in the area that you'd recommend to buy Urb or similar cartridges for D8/D9/THC infinity/etc (aka diet weed). \n\nTourist spots/popular spots to AVOID, that aren't worth the hype. \n\nAny major differences in laws for everyday life compared to Texas?

If you want to go on country walks, then I'd recommend Box Hill in Surrey (40mins from Clapham junction) or maybe some of the villages in Sussex like Balcombe or Hassocks (~40-60mins from London bridge). There's not a lot in the villages themselves, but they're in beautiful countryside. \n\nIf you like the seaside, then the closest/easiest is probably the Kent coast- Whitstable is a lovely town. There's a nice walk you can do from Canterbury to Whitstable, takes about 3 hours (the route is called the Crab and Winkle way, it's marked on Google maps). Both towns are about an hour from St Pancras on the high speed line.",

Transit is very doable even for Coronado Island and Ocean Beach, the airport is close to downtown, and rail is available to many of the coastal towns between there and LA.  Lots of good food, and several good microbreweries if you are into that.\n\nMaybe do a day in LA and get a tour instead of renting a car, and then take Amtrak from LA Union Station to San Diego for a couple of days?",

And it's popular with film/TV buffs for obvious reasons. But if you mainly just care about hanging out on the beach, there are much better ones elsewhere. At least, that's my opinion as a resident. \n\nBut FYI for Disneyland - it's not in LA, it's in Anaheim (Orange County), which on a good day is like a ~45min drive from downtown LA. Some people claim you can get there in 30 mins from DTLA \"with no traffic\", but there's always traffic. It's one of the most reliable things about the greater LA area. Unless you go at like 5am I guess. You can get there by public transport from DTLA in varying combos of metro/train/bus, but that takes closer to 2 hours (or so I've heard - I've only ever gone by car). Universal Studios is in LA though and it's easily accessible by the metro (it has its own stop).",

Yeah it's showing about 2+ hours on transit, so it looks like Uber or a car rental is probably the best way to go. Time is way more valuable to me than saving a bit of money.\n\nShe's interested in doing Universal Hollywood, Walk of Fame, etc\u2014Basically touristy stuff, lol.

If you want somewhere safe I can recommend the Monceau and Batignolles areas of the 17th arrondissement - they're mostly residential and full of Parisians, not tourists, so generally more chill and there aren't people trying to target tourists as much. There are some good value Airbnb properties depending on when you go and what your budget is. \n\nI've travelled round lots of European cities with friends and by myself, I also lived in Japan so have a good comparison on what feels safe. Don't let your worries hold you back, it sounds like you have an amazing trip lined up!",

Enjoyed it so much that I did 3 weeks solo two years later after the GF dumped me.\n\nBtw, congratulations on finishing your doctoral program at 25 - that takes a heck of a lot of determination...\n\nAustria and Czech Republic would be a good start, as would smaller Spanish cities like Bilbao.  Get to know the train schedules when planning so that you always have \"bonus\" day trips to take when you get fantastic weather, and so you can do some of your nights in sleepier but more affordable cities.  I've not been to Hungary,  Slovenia, or Poland but they are on my list.\n\nThe huge world-class cities such as Paris and London are obviously great but they will take up a disproportionate amount of your budget.  I would have one or two in mind but do your first two weeks in smaller locales and see what your actual spend is, and then recalibrate how much time you can spend in larger more expensive cities.",

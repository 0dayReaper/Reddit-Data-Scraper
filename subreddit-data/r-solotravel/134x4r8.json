    "postText": "ok I am still shivering as I am writing this so please bear with me if the phrases make little sense.\n\nI am a solo woman travelling Jordan. So far I loved it and loved the people. Today i took a day trip from Amman to Jerash, I went there by taxi.\n\nto come back, I read online there\u2019s a local bus that for 1 jod takes you back to amman (1hour drive) but it only departs once it\u2019s full.\n\nBeing on a budget, I go for this option, so I exit the touristic site and try to find the bus station asking to locals and they guide me a bit far (keep in mind i have no idea where the bus station is or how the buses looks like).\n\ni get to a point where there are several little white buses parked one after another, completely empty. I made the mistake to ask the people near the busses if they were headed to Amman and the men all starts getting closer and closer trying to convince me to hop on on their empty busses, and they even start shouting at each other on the street because each one wants me to get on their bus.\n\nat this point I feel unsafe and confused and \u201cdecided\u201d to get on one, thinking I\u2019ll wait for other people to join since i clearly read multiple times online it only departs once full.\n\nas soon as i get on, the driver also gets on and shout the door and starts driving. At this point i\u2019m confused and started asking him if it was the right bus and for just 1jod. He doesn\u2019t speak any english (which is weird for a driver, everyone i met so far speak at least the basics) and looks agitated and in a hurry but he nods and says it\u2019s the right bus for that specific price.\n\nnow, the way back to town is almost 1 hour drive, there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll get to town with basically a private transportation for that price. doesn\u2019t make any sense, the taxi alone was 20. Local buses are cheaper bus because it\u2019s made for multiple people, so how come he started driving in a hurry as soon as i got on?\n\nat this point I\u2019m monitoring the position of the bus on google maps, after 20 minutes of highway (same way i did on the taxi to get there) he slows down and move to a secondary street in the opposite direction of amman. I asked why he didn\u2019t follow the highway and he says that\u2019s the right way. He stops for a moment and makes a quick phone call always with the same agitated manner.\n\nat this point i decide to trust my guts so i fake a phone call with a friend and requested that the let me get off immediately. I gave him the money and started heading back to the main street panicking and crying.\n\nnow, can somebody help me understand what just happened? is it common for local buses charging 1jod to transport just 1 person? is it a scam for tourists where they initially tell you it\u2019s 1 but then once arrived it magically becomes 100? why the hell he stopped following the main road and started driving in the opposite direction in a secluded street?\n\nI feel like a stupid because maybe it was all legit and I just panicked, but still something tells me there was something off.\n\nend of the story is: i\u2019m still pretty shaken and feel scared to even get out of my hostel now.",

Whatever the situation was  you were clearly feeling unsafe and acted in your best interest by leaving. No matter what, personal safety comes first. \n\nPersonally I wouldn't have gotten on the bus. Besides that it sounds like an obvious tourist scam, you are traveling alone and thus are more vulnerable for things like this to happen. \n\nI don't know anything about the Jordan situation so can't help you there. But anxiety wise, it's best to talk to someone about it and try to visit a public space where you know it will be safe and try to catch your breath. Build up your confidence and remember that you acted correctly in the most important part, you got yourself safe. \n\nWish you all the best for the rest of your travels!",

Even I as a guy won't get into any form of transportation unless we agree on price, I see some identification or any signals that the driver seems fair.  Even if I see a yellow cab in NYC and the driver is shouting on a call while they pick me up - that's a no-go for me.  I don't want to be in the presence of some pissed off driver.",

            "comment": "My first time visiting, before I lived there, I made the mistake of not taking a real cab at the airport and went with one of those random people offering rides. When leaving the airport, he didn\u2019t pay for parking, but instead waited for the car in front to go and then punched the gas and let the barrier fall down on his truck. Then he sped off, drove a bit, and pulled off the highway to a sketchy-ass gas station with several other cars. They then had me switch cars, and honestly I was scared and thought I was potentially being scammed, or worse, kidnapped and extorted.\n\nI got in the new car and it was a very kind old man who offered me coffee, tea, and cigarettes. He also helped me figure out the Arabic Airbnb directions. It ended up being a really interesting, albeit scary experience, and I didn\u2019t get scammed or anything.\n\nThat being said, your driver was definitely doing some sketchy shit. I think you absolute did the right thing. He was likely going to try and get some more money out of you, or worse. \n\nI lived in Amman for a summer after my experience and took several of those white busses throughout Jordan. I was also never alone. Generally, they are safe, however mostly locals use them, and I highly recommend knowing exactly where you want to go and how to communicate that in Arabic to use them safely. The drivers can get competitive and aggressive, especially with non-Jordanians, but I never had a driver go off course like that. I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you.",

            "comment": "Something similar happened to me in Guatemala boarding a public boat that takes you to different villages around this lake. Long story short, the boat leaves when it\u2019s full and one day I started stepping onto a boat thinking I was the first one on, and as I step in, the boat starts leaving the dock. I IMMEDIATELY jumped off the boat and back onto the dock right in time. I made something up like I was waiting for my friend and didn\u2019t realize we were leaving. I would NEVER get in transportation by myself as a man, let alone being a solo female traveler. Afterwards, I observed the dock and learned that the \u2018public\u2019 boats that wait to fill up before leaving are parked in the same spots. Who knows where I would have been taken had I not jumped off that other boat.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a hostel, I would ask them to arrange transportation back to Amman for you. That is the only way I would feel comfortable going back or if others are there traveling back, you guys can take a shared transfer together. Many times I\u2019ve had hostels arrange a shuttle and they usually pick other backpackers up along the way who are also going to the same places. Please do this. Not worth saving that much if you end up dead. Sorry to be harsh but this wouldn\u2019t even be a question in my mind in terms of how to get back.\n\nAlso, if you're ever in a situation like that again where you're unsure, DO NOT get into a van by yourself. Walk to any hostel and speak to their front desk and/or other backpackers and figure out other transportation.",

Takes a bit more Google searching these days, as most bloggers just post pretty pictures but there are still those posting useful pics. Having some visual clues as to what I should be looking for on the streets has always made me feel safer.\n\nNow I don't know if this works all the time but one time I ended up in an illegal taxi rank had a similar situation to you where they were all trying to pursade me into their taxi. I had no idea what they were saying so I opened the Google Translate app, as soon my translated phrase came out of the phone it stopped the arguing. I think they were a bit perplexed to be honest\ud83d\ude02, this was before Google Translate voice was well known. Anyway forcing them to talk into my mobile's microphone meant they couldn't cross talk or talk over each other so it did give me some control over the situation. I probably still got ripped off but those who stayed (some drivers walked off when they saw what I was doing) I felt were probably less likely to kill me in a dark alley which I know is over dramatic but that was the sense of fear I had at the time.",

If not all seats are filled up then the other passengers are given the option to split the price of the remaining passengers among them or to wait. Probably he hoped that you would just pay the full price for the bus instead of waiting for others. In my experience, it\u2019s not uncommon for them to think tourists don\u2019t want to wait. \n\nRegarding him not speaking English, in my experience most Jordanian bus drivers don\u2019t speak English. \n\nI think I know the secondary road you\u2019re talking about. On Google maps it looks sketchy, but it\u2019s actually necessary to slightly move away from Amman through the hills to then start driving towards it. \n\nNevertheless, if you felt unsafe then there\u2019s nothing wrong with you getting off of the bus whenever you did.",

I made a trip to Jordan in early March and ended up in a similar scary situation, and I'm a guy.\n\nI was heading to Aqaba after visiting Wadi Rum. Did a hot air balloon flight on the morning and they drop you off at the Wadi Rum visitor centre. I was trying to find a taxi ride from there to Aqaba and I was having difficulty getting an official one. Lots of men were asking if I'd go with them, offering seemingly random prices. One of them offered to take me for the going rate of 25 JD saying he had a shared ride, so I figured why not.\n\nI got into his jeep and then he mentioned that he just had to pick the other people up from the Wadi Rum town before we drive to Aqaba. Seemed odd but ok. Turns out the guy drove me to his home in the Wadi Rum town and told me the other passenger is his wife. He started showing me this map and a route we could take over the desert to a small village near the Saudi Arabia border and then into Aqaba from the south. Then quoting prices around 50 JD.\n\nAlarm bells were already ringing by the time we got to his home, but as soon as I learned of his plan I was like hell no. I got up and walked out of that house and back to the main road of the Wadi Rum town as fast as I could. Sorted a proper taxi from there.\n\nThe guy may have been genuinely trying to earn some money offering me some kind of private tour, but I wasn't going to take that risk with a random person. I also had a flight to catch that evening so no time for tours. The taxi I took had to go through a police checkpoint on the way into Aqaba, so it may be that this stranger was trying to avoid that by taking a back route as he obviously wasn't a licensed taxi.\n\nThis guy wasn't even the strangest person I shared a car with on my trip. Had one tour guide taking me on a private tour (arranged by hotel) to some tourist sites north of Amman (Jerash and a couple of others) who spent most of the journey talking about gay sex and gay culture in Jordan. Quite awkward. I suspect he was probing my sexuality.",

I always ended up using a driver.\n\nI absolutely hate being packed in like this and would definitely prefer any form of transport that avoids this. However alone in a car with someone can be sketchy for some (especially solo females) as well, so it sometimes feels like there's no winning! But at least with Uber and such you can track your ride and send it to others so they know where you are and when you arrive (or god forbid, don't).\n\nBut to echo the other comments here, best to trust your gut no matter what!",

If you hadn't gotten out when you did you probably wouldn't got to post this. Years ago when I was hitch hiking a man picked me up. He was suppose to take me to the train station. He asked a lot of strange questions, like \"where do you live\", \"how long are you staying\", \" do you have friends here\", \"does your family know where you are\", ect. He then pointed to a house off in the distance, I could only see smoke coming out of a chimney. He then explain he was a chicken farmer and needed to stop home first before he could take me to the station. He went down a narrow walled road. I then said \"no, I want out\", he said wait until we get to then so he could turn around. I refused opened the door as much as I could, he stopped fearing damage of his car. I jumped out and ran back to the main road, never looking back, but knowing he couldn't turn around. I was shaken and ended up getting a ride by a nice lady. Whenever you don't feel safe or something seems wrong get out!!!!",

One trick I always do (aging solo female traveller) when I get in a vehicle, even though I only get into vehicles I think I can trust.  Before I get in I make a little production of taking a quick photo of the vehicle on my phone, including the license number.  When I get in, I cheerfully tell the driver I have just emailed this photo to my husband, as he likes to be able to keep track of where I am at all times.  (I neglect to mention hubbie is back in Australia, and never bothers to read his email.)\n\nAnd no, those little service buses you see all over the world aren\u2019t taxis, don\u2019t transport just one person.  They are strictly for locals, cheap transportation that usually sits and waits for enough passengers before departing.  Stay away from them.  The honest, decent drivers can\u2019t help you, and you don\u2019t want to be involved with the other sort.  \n\nIn the future, negotiate with the taxi for a round trip.  He has to go back anyway, so really you are just negotiating for his time while he waits.  And that photo I mentioned?  Take that, if only to help you find the right taxi when you come back looking for him.",

I am a bigger girl, long blond hair, big boobs etc. and though I dressed very modestly, I was leered at A LOT. Like not an observational look. I was 36 at the time. I had heard how wonderfully modern Jordan was compared to a lot of the middle east, and it was beautiful and wonderful WHEN I had a male companion. Younger people may poo poo this, but they are the same people who feel the USA is a racist hell hole.

I don\u2019t know what the scam was, but I believe you made the right decision to get out of there because the driver\u2019s intention definitely seemed nefarious and the circumstances do not pass the smell test",

He was likely going to try and get some more money out of you, or worse. \n\nI lived in Amman for a summer after my experience and took several of those white busses throughout Jordan. Generally, they are safe, however mostly locals use them, and I highly recommend knowing exactly where you want to go and how to communicate that in Arabic to use them safely. I was also never alone; like another person mentioned, they almost always tried to fill every seat before leaving. The drivers can get competitive and aggressive, especially with non-Jordanians, but I never had a driver go off course like that. I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you.",

Always trust your instincts in these situations and never worry about offending someone if you feel that something isn't right.

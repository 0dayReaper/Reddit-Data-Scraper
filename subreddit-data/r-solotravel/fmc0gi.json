    "postText": "I just made the decision to come home to the USA from Australia. Probably worse off here, but its better to be home. I ended up with my parents which was not ideal as they have comorbidities, but I developed a plan. I asked them to drape and tape off a certain room and bathroom that has a private entrance. They put a minifridge and microwave in the room. We will have no face to face contact or shared surfaces. A bit extreme, but they are at higher risk... We have a table outside the private entrance where they can leave stuff for me. I will clean at the end of quarantine and they won't use the same room for 3-4 days after that, just in case. If you don't have these luxuries, avoidance and wearing a mask indoors with good hand hygiene is the current recommendation. \n\n\nMake a plan, stick to it for the entire 14, maybe even 16 days if others are at higher risk. Godspeed, dear mates\n\nUPDATE: CDC has updated recommendations on quarantining when you come home. Remember that Pompeo said all countries are Level 4, probably a good idea to just quarantine if you had any international travel. \n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html\n\nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/travel-advisory-alert-global-level-4-health-advisory-issue.html#.XnPHGUBrXPM.twitter",

This is what I'm currently waiting for. Once they give you the all clear the rest of the process is supposed to be just like regular traveling. Good luck, and if you're planning on coming back I'd do it soon. There were some reports that they are going to shut down the borders even for Americans soon.",

I've also never used zoom so much in my life, it really is a good way to stay connected. \n\nIt sucks not being with friends but I think you're doing a good thing by self isolating. As I'm driving around I've been seeing all thes families and elderly people completely ignoring the social distancing ordenances, and it makes me sad that not everyone is playing their part, but it also gives me hope that it seems like most young people I know are.

By the time we were coming home, the situation had completely changed back home. I seriously doubt we picked anything there, but traveling through multiple airports on the way back was more concerning, despite being careful. \n\nWe got back Monday and we are in full quarantine mode and are both working from home. We've only gone out for groceries, and we wore gloves to protect others best we can just in case. So far so good, neither of us are showing any symptoms. But we will ride out the full isolation period regardless. Probably longer since there's a good chance everything will be shut down by then anyway.",

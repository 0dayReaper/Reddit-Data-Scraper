    "postText": "Hey guys. I was supposed to study abroad in England in my freshman year in college, but then COVID disrupted those plans. I was then supposed to study abroad in France, but became unable to because I changed my major and it would have made my schedule impossible. I am now graduated, with a strong yearning to at least do a year abroad. I really want to do it to find myself and get immersed in a foreign culture and language.\n\nI still very much fantasize about the idea of being able to stay in Barcelona or Madrid for a year, as I speak Spanish fluently (I'm latino) and it would be the least jarring experience for myself, or some place like Marseille or Lyon. Has anybody done anything quite like this? Howso and would you recommend it? I know about the teaching English abroad, but I've heard that many agencies are shady (and in the case of france, they don't sponsor your visa). \n\nI'm a male btw, if that counts, a US citizen, and I do not qualify for the Spanish colony visa because I don't have citizenship of my family's country.",

            "comment": "I definitely recommend it. One of the options you can look into is working holidays. Unfortunately the options for American citizens are limited, but I believe Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea, and Canada have working holiday visas for Americans. \n\nYou can also look into doing a masters, which is what I did and what I recommend. You get a student visa which in many cases will allow you to work a part-time job to partially support yourself. There are many 1-year masters programs although most are 2 years. It's very common for European graduate degrees to be offered in English.\n\nIf finances are less of a concern, you could look into getting a language-learning visa, which is a common offering that allows you to live for a longer period in a given country, but usually without the right to work.\n\nAu pair visas are also an option, especially in France, and native English speakers are in high demand for this kind of work. Most au pairs are women, but men can do it too.\n\nIf there are any possibilities for you to apply for citizenship through your parents or other members of your family, that might be worth looking into, since other citizenships can sometimes offer many more opportunities for working holiday visas or other international partnerships.",

So I applied for a program in Europe and am currently living in Barcelona! Make sure you work and save up for at least a year before doing so, it is very difficult finding jobs here",

I would probably go for 1-2 months so the 90 day tourist visa is fine for me but Spain also has a really good digital nomad visa as well. The cool part about this is that it will most likely SAVE me a ton of money as compared to what I would pay living in the US.",

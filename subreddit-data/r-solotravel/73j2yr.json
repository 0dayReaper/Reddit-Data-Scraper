It is inevitable however that your bike will break down (Vietnamese Murphy's Law) - Though there are repair shops everywhere, and every second local knows how to fix these things.\n\nIf you\u2019re not experienced in checking out a bike, a good tip would be to go to a local backpackers, befriend someone who is, buy them a beer and ask them to help you test ride one \u2013 You could also ask some of the local shops for advice on this too, take the bike you\u2019re test riding and ask the locals to test ride it (as if you\u2019re going to sell it to them \u2013 They\u2019ll know if anything is wrong).\n\nI would also recommend paying extra to buy the Sufat / Detech style Wins - As you'll be selling at the end, the extra investment doesn't really have a net loss.",

Most travel insurance companies require you to have a license for whatever class of vehicle you're driving in your home country, plus an international driver's permit. If you don't have the license then your insurance will be void, i.e. no cover in case of an accident. Not necessarily saying this should stop you, but better to go in with your eyes open to the risks! ",

You'll also need to allow 3-4 days to buy the bike, and probably the same to sell the bike at the end.\n\nI would only stay between 1-3 nights in each destination, which was certainly hard, and I'd recommend more rest days between each stop. You'll be able to ride between 150-250Kms each day, however you'll no doubt take longer than you'd expect, probably averaging 50Km/h over the whole day due to dirt roads, rain, incorrect routes, river crossings etc. I think the longest I rode in one day was 400-500Km, which was probably 10-12 hours on the road \u2013 I do not recommend this at all.\n\nGoogle maps was a godsend on my phone and helped me 90% of the way \u2013 I would route point A \u2013 B and try to take the back roads (avoiding high ways, especially the A1).\n\nI didn't and still don't know much about motorbike riding, I learned to ride in the backstreets of the city, which I don't recommend.

Once you're confident that you will be able to board the plane (passport, visa, etc.) make active attempts to occupy your mind with anything but your trip. I drink beer and binge on Netflix to stop thinking about things. Try coming to this sub less and less often. \n\nWhen the trip gets closer (1 or 2 weeks away), put on figurative blinders and try to focus on the step immediately in front of you. Focus on making sure you've got a ride to the airport, make sure your alarms are set. Make the big task of \"going on a trip to a foreign country\" into small tasks like \"get to the airport\", \"get boarding pass\", \"find gate\". Focus only on the task in front of you to keep from getting overwhelmed.\n\nWhen you get there, you will probably feel like a jetlagged fish out of water. You will likely be very uncomfortable and very confused. It will seem like everyone knows what to do except you. Don't panic! This feeling will go away after a day or two. Don't expect it to be awesome as soon as you hit the ground. You need to adjust, so don't make any rash decisions during this adjustment phase. I'm 40 and have been on tons of trips. I still get that fish out of water feeling when I start trips. Don't panic and you'll get through it.\n\nIt's like starting a new job or going to a new school. It's weird, awkward, and uncomfortable at first. Then it becomes normal.",

It seems pretty daunting but everyone will be so friendly and including, all you have to do is put yourself out there. Easier said than done of course but the more you push yourself, the more you learn. \n\nI assume you're staying in hostels/dorms (if not, definitely do that) so make sure you introduce yourself to anyone that looks up for a conversation. A simple \"hi\" can evolve into a month long travel companion in no time! You'll get used to the same conversation about where people are from, where they've been, how long they've been travelling for etc. and it seems a bit repetitive but it's worth it to see what people you click with. Other people are your most valuable tool for finding cool locations, activities and ideas during your five months so use that tool and chat away! \n\nBe extremely strict when packing your bag. You can buy anything you need over there and the last thing you want is to carry around a 20kg backpack. My backpack was only 6kg's at the beginning but was bursting by the time I flew home, you'll collect lots of momentos/clothes on your way. \n\nBasically the best thing you can do is say yes to (allllllmost) anything. \n\nThat's all I can think of for now but will add anything else I think of.\n\nI backpacked through Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos so I'm happy to provide any info on those countries if you need.

Thinking of starting from Hanoi on Nov 17 with buying a bike and heading off and reaching HCM in a week or two. I\u2019d love to tag along or have some company if anyone is interested? I just learned to ride to so the company would make me feel safer than on my own. ",

Traffic(in hanoi,saigon) is extremely chaotic and you've constantly got to watch for the random pothole, stray dog, water buffalo or tour bus. \n\nIf you've got serious doubt about it it's best just take the tour bus(might be just as dangerous):),  minivan or train. \n\nI did the Hanoi to Saigon route in March which was spectacular. While Everything north of Hanoi is an entirely different animal. Which has some of the most vast, lush, green and gorgeous landscapes I've ever laid eyes on. The people in the villages And homestays are also so genuinely hospitable. \n\nWith that said, motorbiking in my opinion is by far the best way to see the country!\n\n Either way,  youuu Enjoy yourself!",

    "postText": "Throwing together a last minute trip to Ireland next week. Looking for some feedback on this itinerary. Nothing is booked yet except for flights. I don't plan to rent a car and instead will use public transportation and group tours. As far as sites and tours, I'm more than happy to flex and play it by ear if something better presents itself (or weather doesn't cooperate), but I find that without some sort of general game plan, I end up doing nothing at all and feeling like I wasted my precious time in new places! \n\nDay 1: Arrive Dublin 0745. Bus from airport to Galway. Check in at Galway City Hostel &amp; Bar. Galway City Walking Tour (1.5hr). Wander around. Early bedtime!\n\nDay 2: Connemara and Galway Bay Day Tour (Lally Tours $50; Galway Tour Company $35)\nSpend the evening in town checking out various bars and pubs. Possible spots to check out include Tigh Neachtain, the Crane (traditional music), Barr An Chaladh, Roisin Dubh (music), Paddy Burkes (Irish coffee), The Merlin Bar &amp; Grill, Tig Choilli, Darcy\u2019s Bar\n\nDay 3: Cliffs of Moher Day Trip (Galway Tour Company $50), includes Burren area\n\tAgain, spend the evening in town.\n\nDay 4: Ferry to Inishmore. Check in to Kilronan Hostel. Walking and/or biking.\n\tDun Aengus Fort, the Seven Churches, the Worm Hole, Ciaran\u2019s Monastery\n\tJoe Watty\u2019s pub and seafood bar\n\nDay 5: Ferry back to Galway. Bus back to Dublin. Check in to Abbey Court Hostel or Generator Hostel. ?Hostel pub crawl\n\tBlind Pig Speakeasy\n\nDay 6: Explore Dublin.\n\tPossible sites: Guinness Storehouse, Trinity College and Library, Glasnevin Cemetery, Poolbeg Lighthouse, Kilmainham Gaol\n\nDay 7: Daytrip to Howth Cliff Walk\n\nDay 8: Daytrip to Giant\u2019s Causeway? Versus hanging out and continuing to explore Dublin.\n\nDay 9: Chill, slow-paced morning. Depart Dublin 1315. \n\n\nI would love feedback on anything I've listed that isn't worth the time, as well as any great experiences I've missed. I would also appreciate any recommendations or warnings about day-trip tour companies, based on personal experience. It seems like there are a lot of option to choose from! Any personal recommendations on hostels would be great too, I would prefer all-female dormitories or private rooms but that isn't a requirement.\n\nKind of thinking about skipping Dublin altogether, except as a transportation hub. Maybe it would be worth it to rent a car in Galway on Day 5 driving down to Dingle, maybe do Ring of Kerry/Killarney, and only drive back to Dublin the night before leaving?",

            "comment": "I think it sounds like a solid itinerary. Do you really want to stay on Inishmore for the night? Most tourists do a day trip and leave the island on the 5 pm ferry. I've been once and really enjoyed staying the night but I'm from the west of Ireland and just went drinking and chatting with the locals. If you are bringing luggage you should ask your accommodation in Galway would they be willing to keep your luggage overnight.\n\nEdit: Definitely biased but I would pick Dingle over Dublin all day",

I mostly just don\u2019t want to rush around, rather take my time and maybe get a nice sunset/sunrise out of it as well. \n\nI actually decided to scrap the entire Dublin portion after seeing hostel prices\u2026 instead I\u2019m going to rent a car after all, do a couple of days in Dingle, do the Ring of Kerry, and only head back to Dublin for the last night before flying out.",

(Practically the whole island in 9 days). \nI\u2019m starting to think that I should focus on half the island on this trips and do the other half on another go. Definitely getting a major case of FOMO.",

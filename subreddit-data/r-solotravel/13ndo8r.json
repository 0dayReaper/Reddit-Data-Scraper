    "postText": "Greetings fellow passengers. In the middle of August, I will be going to Japan. I already know I will be checking out Tokyo Dome City, Universal Studios Osaka, Tokyo Disneyland, and all the other main tourist attractions. While I am there, two tentpole movies are coming out, Nickoledeon\u2019s \u2018Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\u2019 and DC\u2019s \u2018Blue Beetle\u2019. \n\nIf I see these films in Japan, will there be English subtitles? Or will I be better off waiting for my return to Melbourne?",

            "comment": "Sometimes they play movies in the original language with Japanese subtitles. You'd have to check the specific showtime to be sure. As a side note, movie watching culture in Japan is a little bit different - people generally stay quiet and try not to make any noise in consideration of other moviegoers. Oftentimes, everyone sits through the credits at the end of the movie.",

When you buy a ticket it will say Japanese Dubbed or Japanese Subbed and if you get the subbed tickets they are just the English version, just with Japanese subtitles. You can buy tickets online with ease.\n\nIt's the same movie going experience and I highly recommend it. The tickets are cheaper here than in Australia.",

But going to the cinema in Japan is a relaxing experience. If you're short on time, I'd suggest not bothering until you return home, but if you've got free time and want to see a film then go for it.\n\nSubtitled films will have \u5b57\u5e55 in their title, whereas dubbed films will say \u5439\u66ff. If you have any knowledge of written Japanese, it can be fun to see what gets lost in translation. Guardians 3 had a lot of jokes/nuances that they didn't even bother to translate for the Japanese subtitles.",

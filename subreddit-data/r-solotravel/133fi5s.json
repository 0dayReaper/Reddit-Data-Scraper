    "postText": "Flying into Guatemala City this upcoming Friday night, and I've never visited before. Would love if experienced solo travelers could take a look and suggest any changes they'd personally make based off of their trips:\n\n\n\n**Fri May 5th** - Flight arrives 9:50pm -&gt; Uber to Antigua (stay @ Tropicana Hostel)\n\n**Sat May 6th** - Explore Antigua, find a tour company for Acatenango hike next morning (stay @ Purpose Hostel)\n\n\n**Sun May 7th** - Begin Acatenango hike, camp out with tour group\n\n\n**Mon May 8th** - Summit Acatenango, hike down, arrive in Antigua early afternoon and shuttle to Panajachel (stay @ Dreamboat hostel)\n\n**Tuesday May 9th** - Day tour of Lake Atitlan (Indian Nose Hike if possible?), find tour for Volcan San Pedro hike (stay @ Dreamboat hostel)\n\n**Wednesday May 10th** - Hike Volcan San Pedro, come back and relax at hostel (stay @ Dreamboat hostel)\n\n**Thursday May 11th** - Shuttle from Panajachel to Guatemala City, explore the city (stay @ hotel - haven't booked anything yet)\n\n**Friday May 12th** - Day tour of Tikal (fly in and out same day - something like [this](https://www.viator.com/tours/Guatemala-City/Tikal-Day-Trip-by-Air-from-Guatemala-City-with-Lunch/d4595-5555GUATIKAL) (stay @ hotel - haven't booked yet)\n\n**Saturday May 13th** - Explore Guatemala City until heading to airport at 9pm for midnight flight home\n\n\nI'm unsure if I'll be too sore to try and hike San Pedro only two days after finishing Acatenango, I'm in decent shape but not elevation acclimated so maybe someone could tell me about their experiences with these hikes. \n\nI also feel iffy about only getting to spend a day in Tikal, though even though it's expensive I'd absolutely love to visit the ruins and would be willing to pay. If there are any super cool ruins near Panajachel or Antigua though, I'd swap out that portion for a trip there instead, because currently it seems like a lot of travel to squeeze in a couple of days just for Tikal.\n\nAnyway, any insight would be super helpful - thanks!",

            "comment": "I'd definitely skip Guatemala City altogether as there's not much to see there, and there's no point really in going to Tikal for 1 day. \n\nInstead you should spend more time at Lake Atitlan. It's awesome there, and there's a bunch of unique little towns all around the lake. \n\nYou'll have fun at the dreamboat. It's a party hostel.\n\nSince you like outdoorsy stuff I'd say go to Semuc Champey, as it has some great tubing, hiking, and some amazing pools to swim in, but it's pretty far from Antigua/Lake Atitlan, so probably not possible.",

Based on the hikes you want to do around lake Atitlan it might be more convenient to stay in San Pedro on the other side of the lake. \n\nThere\u2019s also a cool platform to jump in the lake from in San Marcos. If you\u2019re interested in yoga, I\u2019d recommend eagle\u2019s nest Atitlan.

You\u2019re doing a lot of moving both with climbing and transpiration. I\u2019d slow down- Antigua, acatenango, atitlan and end your trip there. Cut out Tikal and Guatemala City",

It\u2019s more hassle then it\u2019s worth. \n\nAll the popular hostels will offer a tour to Acatenango via different tour companies, and Tropicana is the only one that does their own tour IIRC and you can book a tour with them even if you aren\u2019t staying there. I suggest doing your research ahead of time and see what tour company suits your needs. The average price is around $70 up to $100+ USD with the more expensive one offering more amenities like better shelter, English speaking guides, and trekking pole rentals. \n\nAnd as others have already mentioned, you\u2019re spending far too little time in Antigua. You want to acclimatize and prepare for the hike, and coming back down, even when you\u2019re a experienced hiker or physically active, will be exhausting and the last thing you want to do is pack up to leave to go somewhere else. \n\nIt\u2019s far too much to try to fit Tikal and there\u2019s not really anything you\u2019re missing out in Guatemala City. You\u2019re better spending the extra time checking out Antigua and the other towns around Lake Atitlan. Panajachel is more of a stopping point and people usually stay in the other towns like San Pedro or San Marcos. Dreamboat is also very much a party hostel in case you didn\u2019t already know.",

Maybe though I just cancel that and just walk over later in the day to book. \n\nDef will cut out Tikal/Guatemala City as per everyone's suggestions, and maybe push back the volcano hike by a day to acclimate. Do you have any suggestions for activities during the day in Antigua? \n\nAs for Panajachel, that's good to know - would you recommend any other hostels around Lake Atitlan in San Pedro/San Marcos? I'm down for *some* partying but I'm more interested in meeting other travelers who I could potentially do day trips/activities with. \n\nAnyway thanks for the insight!",

I stayed at a place called Mandala nearby and it\u2019s a much chiller hostel and no bunk beds. Santa Cruz has Free Cerveza which is very popular with backpackers. But there are lots of options you can find via Hostelworld and Booking.com (though you\u2019ll need to search by each town).",

Is it easy to take care of it?",

After you get the tattoo and do the initial cleaning, you apply the sheet and leave it for a week.  No peeling, no needing to apply lotions and keep it moisturized, no washing it three times a day, and most importantly, no worries of it getting infected because of places you're visiting.",

            "comment": "If you're from the US (not sure if you can buy outside of US/Canada), I personally use saniderm instead of tegaderm. Saniderm is created specifically for tattoos instead of burns. Not sure what kind/how big of a tattoo you're going for. \n\nNo matter what, change the saniderm after 24 hours (make sure you clean the site between changing) since the beneficial plasma that helps the wound heal \"goes bad\", or it will start leaking if it's a big tattoo. If it leaks at any time change the saniderm. If it's a small tattoo and you don't see any leaking you can leave it on for a full week maximum after the first 24 hour change.\n\nI got a big tattoo while I was in Greece last year and the saniderm was perfect and allowed me to continue doing my normal activities. Ever since I tried saniderm for the first time I haven't gone back to traditional aftercare. It is so much easier and I haven't had any issues with healing etc. \n\nBtw if you go this route, watch some videos about how to properly remove it so you dont end up harming the tattoo. Let me know if I can be of any more help and good luck!",

At that point I had made the call that my tattoo had healed enough to be okay. That being said I still kept it out of the water ware I could.\n\nIf I was to do the trip again I would opt for booking in an appointment towards the end of the trip, but it wasn't the worst thing managing aftercare whilst traveling.\n\nOverall the tattoo has healed very well!",

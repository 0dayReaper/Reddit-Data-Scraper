    "postText": "Introvert female who love to travel but in a situation where I cant find anyone to travel with. I love to travel so I started traveling solo as well as took group trips locally plus one international trip to West Europe. \n\nBut I dont like to travel solo at all. Even though I am capable of doing things independently. I dont feel comfortable doing everything all alone, with no one to talk to, making itineraries, doing bookings, being cautious about safety measures all the time. It's too much of going out of comfort zone for me. I feel happier &amp; safe when I travel with others even if they are strangers. \n\nI have anxiety issues. I get mood swings as well and when I am happy I start making solo plans but the moment my energy is low, I get overwhelmed and cancel everything. I can continue backpacking group trips but those are very costly and tend to have rushed itineraries.\n\nWhat should I do? Spend money in group trips, keep pushing myself for solo travels, or be content with my life and stop traveling at all?",

You see she could not bear the thought of having to put one in cargo, and it was one cat in carrier per person for cabin travel.\n\n\nSo yeah, some red flags, but nothing too bad; we just needed to vet each other(pun halfways intended).\n\n\nSo we got the general agreement of what was expected, she did not really need a travel buddy but was moving back to Poland and needed help with her cats.  I have 6 cats myself, and was planning to go next door to Ukraine and teach English, and travel; perfecto!\n\n\nI reviewed her comment history on reddit; always take that with a grain of salt as you know people like to joke around on here, also note the age of the account and places they comment.\n\nWe PMed back and forth to get a feel, and then shared social media, in this case facebook; same deal there.  She worked at a university in Arizona via facebook, so I went to the university website after asking what department she worked in, and sure enough her bio and picture was there as well.\n\n\nSo I feel like this was even more than I typically do, but you get the picture.  Long story short this was a few months into the pandemic, and when the time for the travel grew close(pre-tickets)  Poland closed its borders to non-citizen, so there was really nothing I could do......   \n\n\nI went through all those steps, and I understand as someone with a lot of anxiety you could be more risk averse than myself, but I felt 100% cool with my vet on her; and sad I never got to meet her kitties!",

It was in Morocco, a trip into the Sahara, so it was an expensive trip but I wanted to see it! It worked for me to have some structure and some free time and it broke the trip down. Plus the group trip I didn\u2019t have to organise anything at all, it was done for me. I know it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea but I enjoyed it. I had a few days first where I did a lot, then the trip, then had a few chilled days afterwards to relax as it was a holiday too!\n\nTo be honest, having not travelled solo since January 2020, I\u2019m getting wary about going again now I can do so I do get it! I\u2019ll probably do something similar again next time or start with smaller trips.",

Instead make the final decisions after you arrive, and take some days off doing easy stuff like visiting local museums or the local beach.",

Here\u2019s my little tip:\n\nyou can check things like meetup and couchsurfing. I have just found out about the two and I really wish I had known about it sooner. You can meet solotraveling people so easily with these two apps. About CS: you don\u2019t need to stay at other peoples places if you are not into that, but you can let other people know where you are and that you are willing to meet up for drinks or to explore. You can check the profiles for references of course. I met quite a lot of awesome people through that app. I\u2019d recommend it for you. Meetup is something that I haven\u2019t tried yet but it surely seems like a very good way to meet people and do all sorts of fun activities for free or for a low wage",

The number one issue I get anxiety about is my safety and navigating around (especially going to places where there is a language barrier.) I just try to push myself to go to anyway and not wait for people to live my life. I do feel better with travel groups because the people are usually nice and I have options to be introverted and crawl back into my shell throughout the itinerary when I need to. I really wish I could have someone to share those memories and experiences with though.",

I'll have lots of energy one day, then be tired and anxious and isolating the next. What worked out really well for me was booking a private room at a social hostel. Tons of other solo travellers and so it was easy to find travel buddies, and then I had a private room to retreat to when I felt myself getting moody.",

We keep a low profile and stay respectful of local culture. This pretty much allows us to do whatever we want - as long as we\u2019re comfortable with the risks. \n\nSafe travels!",

My mind was so stuck on the idea of traveling with best friends or families as if there's no other way. I am planning my first solo trip to SEA in July and pretty sure that I will get more and more anxious as the date approaches. And I don't want to have a burnout given that at the beginning I tend to do research on an excessive level. As I haven't done it before, I tend to have high expectations. What if I don't make any friends along the way, etc. Eating alone is also a big issue for me. But I am sure that I will not falter at any given moment.",

Planning a trip with friends seems even harder especially when you are the one who initiate the idea as if you by default have greater responsibility in making the trip well-organized. Forgot to mention my mood swing is also pretty bad. I think the itinerary must be very flexible and not based on strict timeline so that we can adjust freely based on our mood. If I don't feel uplifted, I will definitely avoid tourist attractions and find somewhere chill and quiet. Crowds really causes me anxiety and loneliness sometimes. And I have this impression that I should restrain myself from texting my friends at home constantly when I am travelling. Because my mood could be easily affected by their responses and the instant they don't text back, loneliness hits.",

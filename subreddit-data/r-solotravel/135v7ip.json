    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nI am planning to embark on a solo summer expedition to SE Asia. I know, not an ideal time to go but late June - August is all I have. This is an 8-9 weeks long itinerary I've come up with. I would love if you can offer suggestions to expand the itinerary with activities/destinations that are good to go in the summer months. I will take these suggestions and edit this post to build a comprehensive itinerary with you :) \n\nEnd of June: \n\n* **Bangkok, Thailand** (4-5 days)\n   * markets, temples, Anthony Bourdain's restaurants\n* **Chiang Mai, Thailand** (10 days)\n   * temples, markets, nightlife (3 days)\n   * wat doi suthep vipassana (5/7 days)\n* **Pai, Thailand** (7 days) - ((***July***))\n   * *would love any recs for yoga/meditation recs*\n* **Chiang Rai, Thailand** (4 days)\n   * Wat Phra Kaew, Baan Dam Museum, night bazaar \n* **Laos?** *i haven't figured out this part of the plan yet, alternatively - flight to* ***Sa Pa, Vietnam*** *($115)*\n*  **Sa Pa, Vietnam** (4 days)\n   * rice fields \n   * transfer to Hanoi (train 320VND/ bus 300VND)\n* **Hanoi, Vietnam** (4-5 days)\n   * temples, museums, markets\n* **Halong Bay** (3 days)\n* Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh (9-12 days)  - or by flight (1 day) - should cost around the same as the train all the way\n   * by train, stopping at Da Nang, Ninh Binh, or Nha Trang\n      * *has anyone done this and recommend this experience during the summer? I fear the train will be too hot...* \n* **Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam** (4 days) ((***August***))\n   * markets, museums\n   * transfer to Phnom Penh - bus/minibus (9 hours)\n* **Phnom Penh, Cambodia** (2-3 days)\n   * royal palace\n   * I plan to take a boat to Siem Reap, wondering if anyone has any recommendations\n* **Siem Reap, Cambodia** (4-5 days) \n   * expecting the weather to be unpredictable, so will probably have to stick around for a few days \n   * Angkor wat\n* **Koh Rong, Cambodia** (via Siem Reap to Sihanoukville)  (5-6 days)\n   * unwind and relax after the trip \n* Back to **Bangkok** and home \n\nPlease suggest any changes to this itinerary - given this is intended for summer travel. I rather stay in one place for a week than move around and spend most of my time commuting. Things I want to do/see include: \n\n* temples &amp; museums \n* trekking (multi-day +)\n* diving, although it might not be the season for it\n* vipassana and yoga retreats\n\nAlso, if the heat will be unbearable in Vietnam, I'll cut straight to Phnom Penh from Chiang Rai - or spend a few days in Laos. Would love you guys' opinion on this matter!\n\n**Budget:**\n\n* In terms of budget, I expect this trip to cost around $2,100 - $3,000, excluding flight to Bangkok, given that I plan to take 4 flights (Chiang Rai - SaPa, Hanoi-Ho Chi Minh, Siem Reap -  Sihanoukville, Sihanoukville - Bangkok via Siem Ream; which should cost around $600 altogether). I plan to average at around $35/day, for 60 days, for accommodations and food ($2,100). \n\nI will post my spending after the trip!",

Luang Prabang is a really chill place to base yourself in for a few days or a week or so and just see the sights. You can bus from Chiang Rai to Chiang Khong and then get a 2-day slow boat over from northern Thailand along the Mekong to Luang. I'd shave a couple of days off of Chiang Rai and add them to this portion of your trip, IMHO. From there, Lao Airlines flies direct from Luang Prabang to Hanoi 3x/week.",

Because otherwise there is nothing to do in Halong Bay, the town itself has nothing to offer. The cheapest 3 days cruise with transportation from/to Hanoi is gonna be 230-250 dollars.",

Also, temples there can pretty expensive so on your budget you won\u2019t be able to visit many of them. For example, the temple of the Emerald Buddha is 500 bath which is 15 dollars. I would say 3 full days is enough for Bangkok. Also since you\u2019re gonna see a lot of way better temples in the north of Thailand you don\u2019t really have to see all of them in Bangkok. Honestly, after you\u2019ve seen 10 Thai temples you kinda saw them all, and temples are way nicer when surrounded by nature like in Chiang Mai.\n\nThere is not much to do in Sa Pa for 4 days either, it\u2019s gonna be the middle of rainy season so it\u2019s probably gonna be very wet and too slippery to do trekking, it was already all orange mud when I was there in April even though it wasn\u2019t the rainy season yet. Trekking in Sa Pa is also not exactly cheap and the right season for it is August and September. Hanoi also can be done in 3 days, old quarter is pretty small and there are not that many attractions in Hanoi especially now that police closed the famous train street. Ho Chi Minh is good for 2 days, War museum was excellent but otherwise it\u2019s a pretty overwhelming city, very loud and polluted, I wouldn\u2019t stay there longer than 2 days. \n\nHonestly, I would just do Hanoi (3 days), bus to Cat Ba and a full day (not overnight) Halong Bay tour from Cat Ba, then bus to Tam Coc (2-3 nights), then Phong Nha (2 nights), then Hue (1 night), Hoi An (2-3 nights). I\u2019d skip Ho Chi Minh and Phnom Penh all together and instead go to Laos to Luang Prabang, Vang Vieng and Nong Kiaw.",

Chiang Rai's night market on Saturday is nice but the daily night market is just so so. I'd really try to get to the big one on Sunday in Chiang Mai. \n\nPai is not worth 7 days at all. Is it a cool experience. Most definitely. The mushroom shake was great. The bars and walking street have a circus-esque vibe to it but it only needs 2-3 days. I recommend taking a scooter (if you are really comfortable) from Chiang Mai to Pai and then back. The ride was pure joy and way better than those busses. Regarding yoga there are a couple of spots in Pai but it's just not really a yoga vibe there, more of a circus frat vibe. I'd say cut the amount of time to 3 nights, maybe 4 at most.",

    "postText": "Hi all\n\nI\u2019m gearing up towards my first solo trip. I\u2019m going to Prague for 3 days and super excited! \n\nI\u2019m really looking forward to going solo,but confused on how to take photos. Want to take some full length pics rather than just selfies and wondering the best way to do this? I don\u2019t want to keep asking pestering people to take photos of me and want to figure out how to do it myself as i\u2019m planning another solo trip to NYC in Oct as well. \n\nIs it to set timers and place the phone on the ground. Kind of scared someone might take my phone if I do that? Sorry if i\u2019m being super dense, but any advice is welcome!! \n\nThank you!!\n\nEDIT : Hi, so comments asking why I want the photos. To be very transparent I had a really difficult childhood both mentally/financially and i\u2019ve missed out on a lot growing up. However, I am extremely grateful to live in a country where I had opportunities to study/work and ive got a good job now. I realised I have very little photos (due to reasons stated above) and it was the least of my priorities but I think it would be great to start taking some now to serve as nice memories when i\u2019m older. I\u2019m definitely not going to go abroad and take 100\u2019s of pics but I would like to hold myself account to getting 2-3 nice pics per holiday so I have positive memories to reflect back on.",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t know why people are being so rude about someone wanting photos that aren\u2019t selfies, I think it\u2019s totally normal to want a variety of pictures. Sometimes a selfie just doesn\u2019t capture everything you\u2019d like it to. \n\nI also don\u2019t like asking people to take pictures of me, so I usually I ask people if they would like me to take a photo of them (or they offer) and then I ask if they wouldn\u2019t mind taking a photo of me once I\u2019m done (and sometimes they offer). I find it a lot less awkward this way. \n\nAs a twenty-something female I try to find girls around my age taking pictures and try to ask them, like others have said. I think that they tend to make sure your photos turn out pretty decently. \n\nFinally, if I don\u2019t think anyone looks trustworthy enough to take either good photos or not to take my phone, but the area looks safe enough, I\u2019ll prop my phone up and use my apple watch to make sure I\u2019m properly in frame and to take the pictures. I really don\u2019t like doing that though. \n\nHope you enjoy your trip and get some wonderful pictures! They\u2019re lovely to have to look back on.",

At at least three different tours in India, and one in Dubrovnik (walking tours, or tours around a palace or fortress, etc) the guides took excellent photos. They know all the good angles and photo points, to highlight you against the architecture. \n\nI also am a big fan of the offering to take their photo first approach. Though it\u2019s not necessary, you can always ask out or the blue ti anyone who looks nice and trustworthy. And then say \u201cI\u2019ll take yours after if you\u2019d like\u201d.\n\nAlso ask someone who you think will know how to operate your smartphone camera (or whatever you\u2019re using) ;) the risk of having a bad picture is probably way higher than the risk of your phone/camera getting stolen!",

He said that while working on it he was often asked to take group shots, and that there must be hundreds of families who have a Martin Parr print in their holiday album without even knowing. So try to pick someone who looks like a good photographer!",

            "comment": "5 tips from another traveller who also often travel solo and love to take photos.\n\nLet me start by saying - don\u2019t be afraid to take photos of yourself despite traveling solo. I used to be very conscious about this. But remember - there are millions of photos of these beautiful tourist spots, but there\u2019s none with you in it. So go ahead and take that photo, and strike your best pose while you\u2019re at it!\n\n1. Get a good tripod that is small enough to fit in your bag. There are lots of good yet affordable options available. A bluetooth functionality to control the shutter is NOT necessary.\n2. Download LENS BUDDY on your phone. Use it to take photos instead of the native camera app. It won\u2019t affect the quality of the photos. Set the timer, and how long it should take photos. Delete the ones you don\u2019t like. Repeat as necessary. You can take hundreds of photos in one go. This is the best app. And it is free!\n3. This third one can be a little counter intuitive when you\u2019re on vacation - but, wakeup before sunrise and go to the sites really early in the morning. I used to hate doing this, but I\u2019ve done it often enough that it has become one of my favorite activities when traveling. The golden hour in the morning is the best for photography, there are no people, you can have the most visited places to yourself. It\u2019s the best! I look forward to those moments now.  I find this quite relaxing and meditative. And I've taken my favorite travel photos during this time. After, go to a coffee shop or back to your hotel and enjoy the photos.\n\n4A. If you\u2019re in a crowded place - ask my fellow Asians. Haha. There was viral TikTok video about this, and there\u2019s a lot of truth to it IMHO and based on my own experiences. I think most of us love taking photos, and would gladly take photos of other people too.\n\n4b. If you're in a crowded place - look for your fellow solo travelers. They often take selfies. Offer to take a photo. And ask them to take your photo too. Make their photo nice. And shoot them at the exact same angle/ spot where you want your photo taken. They can just copy it for your turn. I've made a lot of friends just by doing this.\n\n4C. If you're in a crowded place - and conscious about handing a stranger your phone, considering bringing a small camera. Use that instead your phone. There are a lot of point-and-shoot cameras that are good. Just make sure the camera has a wifi or bluetooth function, so you can transfer the images on your phone.\n\n5. Finally, get Lightroom and install your favorite presets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm excited for you and your trip! Take loads of photos!!",

We have pictures of a practically vacant Petra, only a few people around and easy to avoid. Whereas when I went by later in the afternoon it was absolutely packed and no way to avoid people in your shots.",

To be honest I used to think they\u2019re a silly idea but after buying one and using it on my recent solo trip I have to say they\u2019re genius! It looks so much more flattering than a normal selfie, much easier to take pictures with a nice background, and in busier places it felt safer than putting down a tripod. Ideally get a convertible selfie stick/mini tripod for the best of both worlds :) and ignore the comments being negative about taking selfies, it\u2019s your trip and you can take as many as you want! I probably took 100s on my last trip, it\u2019s lovely to be able to look back on those pictures afterwards and see that you were in those amazing places",

Not only are most of them willing to pause for a second to do it, but they usually know how to take a good one.  Just make sure to wait until they are done taking whatever photo they are in the middle of before you ask, don't interrupt while they're setting up a shot.\n\nI'm a photographer and, while traveling, people ask me all the time to use their phone to take a picture of them, I always oblige them.\n\nI also follow this same advice, because as a solo photographer I almost never have pictures of myself.  So when I spot another photog at a cool spot, that's usually who I politely ask to take one for me.\n\nNote:  This is for snapshots, don't expect a traveling photog to do a whole instagram shoot for free or anything like that.\n\nThe other option is get a little tripod and set a timer.  Also works great and is how I sometimes get shots of myself if nobody is around.",

It's a small button you can hold in your hand, hide in your hair, behind your back, etc. that takes a photo when you push it. You can find them for pretty cheap on Amazon, or if you have a smart watch it might have it as a feature.\n\nGet a small tripod, a bendy one, so you can wrap it around railings or trees if need be.\n\nSet up your camera and use either video or single take. I do a mix. You can pull frames you like as photos from the video and you can make yourself a cute video compilation at the end of the trip.\n\nAt museums, employees are often happy to take pics of you. The same goes for tour guides and other guests on guided tours.\n\nAs others have said, ask a group if they would like you to take one of them together and they'll usually offer to return the favour. This works more often than not, but keep in mind people might be weary of handing you their phone or camera in an area known for tourist scams.\n\nYou can get a waterproof phone case that hangs around your neck and drop it into shallow water, then take video of yourself swimming around it. You could also dangle it off railings or trees when in a bind.\n\nAt the end of the day, just know most people there understand photos are an important part of the trip to most of us and will be happy to help you out. Be sure to stay sensible and aware, though, because they might run off with your phone or demand money for the service. Other tourists are usually a safe bet.",

I haven't read them all, but I didn't see anyone call out limitations around tripods/drones. \n\nDrones can be a fun toy if you're a techie, but be careful if you get one. Some countries (ie- Egypt) do not allow drones into the country. Other places (ie- National Parks in the United States) also prohibit drones.\n\nSimilarly, at some attractions (ie- the pyramids in Egypt) if you plan to use a tripod, you need to buy a tripod pass/entry ticket. Usually it's just a few dollars, but it's an added expense and extra hassle. If you use one, plan on people trying to get more money out of you.\n\nI usually just resort to asking others to take pictures of me. It's less things I need to bring with me on my travels and keep track of. Sometimes I will set my phone down and use a timer if I'm somewhere that's not got a lot of people, but that's more so out of concern for looking weird or people walking into the shot not realizing I'm trying to do a picture.",

Tourists aren\u2019t gonna be the one you need to worry about stealing your camera, and often will ask you to take their photo in return. Second, ask groups of people who are taking photos if they could snap one of you when they are finished. Obviously don\u2019t do this if it\u2019s a professional shoot but if it\u2019s casual photos then people won\u2019t mind snapping an extra pic or two. And third, ask younger people (20s) to help take pictures. Oftentimes they will take lots of photos with different angles and shots and are generally really good at iPhone photography or taking Instagram-able pictures.",

If you\u2019re in a tourist-y area, especially if you\u2019re trying to get a picture of yourself in front of a landmark and see other people getting pictures nearby, this would 100% be your best opportunity to ask someone to take your photo - and offer to take theirs in return. For what it\u2019s worth, in these particular spots, I\u2019ve only ever had to ask once or twice - usually people saw me trying to take a selfie, or noticed I was alone, and kindly offered to take my picture. This may entirely depend on where you are (tourist area vs a street on someone\u2019s commute), but it absolutely made me more comfortable with asking someone to take my picture (and I\u2019ve never had someone decline). \n\nHave fun on your trip!",

This is important because you can set up a phone or camera to do timer/trigger shots at your own pace, not be rushed and have little to no interference from others. For the folks you do see, they are likely going to work, and may indulge you for a photo if you ask. That\u2019s my two cents.

Google usually does a good job of showing the activity in different places in terms of being busy. If you go at a time when there are less people, you have more opportunity to find a good spot to take pictures in a more private way. \n\nIf you have extra spending money, you could look into different travel agencies/companies to see if they offer photography services. Even places like yelp, Groupon, or Airbnb have \u201cexperiences\u201d that can be booked where a local photographer will take you to all the \u201ciconic\u201d places and do photo shoots for you. Of course make sure there are good reviews to ensure the person/company is legit. These probably range in pricing but it is an option! \n\nLast piece of advice is if you have IG try to follow some influencers who share their hacks on good photo tips / solo traveler tips. Hope this helps and enjoy your vacation!",

Also, in my experience, sometimes fellow tourists will offer to take the photo for you if they see you struggling with getting the shot.\n\nRemember that while there are thieves and assholes in the world, the vast majority of people are just like you: not looking to steal anyone's phone and not bothered by someone asking if they can take a quick picture.",

A selfie-stick feels silly at first, but totally worth the awkwardness to not have to hand off your phone or camera to a stranger.\n\nEdit: unlesss of course there\u2019s someone else taking a million photos of themselves. Easy exchange to take their picture and have them take yours. But sometimes other people aren\u2019t around.",

            "comment": "There will almost always be other tourists around. If I see a couple or a small group of tourists that are taking selfies or photos, I ask them \"would you mind taking a photo for me?\" while gesturing with my phone. Or, I offer to take a photo for them, and then I ask them to take one of me. \n\nUsually just finding the people nearby who also happen to speak your language (or have the same accent as you) is the easiest way. \n\nIt's actually a great way to meet fellow travelers!",

For starters, there will be a tripod attached to it. \n\nPictures are great. I actually do take hundreds. The more, the better. The #1 rule of good photography is to take a lot of pictures. Weed out the best ones later. Of course less than 10% of them have me in it, but that's ok.",

            "comment": "Yes definitely take pictures to look back on! What I find is that while traveling solo, it is great to go on group tours. Here you will find people you connect with and they will offer to take the pictures for you. Especially if they know you are traveling solo. Even if you don\u2019t speak to people in your group, I found that they will still reach out to you and ask! The world has amazing kind people. Also, you can bring your own tripod and set it up as well. Either way you will get amazing memories! Enjoy yourself and don\u2019t put to much pressure on yourself to capture every little thing. Enjoy the moment as well!",

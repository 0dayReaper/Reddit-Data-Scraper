    "postText": "Going to be in Arequipa for four days following Cusco in early July and I was looking up tours for 2day Chachani climb. Most site ask for $200USD per person but I did find a youtube video citing $80USD (video was bit dated from 2019 or so) so I was wondering if it is cheaper to book one on the ground when I get to Arequipa? Also, I was going to get a new hiking shoes for the trip and was wondering how much it'll be in peru? I'm assuming it'd be cheaper than buying one in nyc (goes for \\~$200USD)?",

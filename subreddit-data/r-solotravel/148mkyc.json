    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI have been planning on interrailing around Europe this summer and here are my plans:\n\nCopenhagen - 1 day\nBerlin - 2 days\nPrague - 4 days\nSalzburg - 2 days\nInnsbruck - 1 day\nLake Como 8 days (+2 travel days)\n\nI will arrive in lake Como in early August and I am starting to question if spending approximately 10 days there is too much? My plan for the trip is to basically lounge. There is a hostel that people are raving about and my plan is basically to hang out in the hostel and meet people, do daily activities, explore the lake and its surroundings etc. However I am afraid that I will get borred like 5 days in despite that I love just hanging around.",

Switzerland specifically has a great train network, and at that point there are also a lot of gondolas reaching the peaks or villages up higher.  The roads in that area are actually forbidden for tourists.  E.g. this village [https://www.audleytravel.com/ca/switzerland/places-to-go/bernese-oberland/wengen](https://www.audleytravel.com/ca/switzerland/places-to-go/bernese-oberland/wengen) it's car free.\n\nFor Ticino, I think there's buses but I would recommend a car.  We stayed in the city of Lacorno, which is also on a lake, Lake Maggiorre.",

You can go to Milano, Firenze, Venice\u2026 they\u2019re not far away. \nI also think 4 days are a bit too much for Salzburg and 1 day is not enough for Berlin.",

Every told me not to so I changed plans and spent 3 nights there and the rest of the time hopping around the country. Best decision. Same as you, I love chilling and hanging around lakes but 3 days is more than enough time to lounge",

There is of course Lago di Garda which I wouldn\u2019t spend more than a day because it is quite touristic. \n\nBut there are a lot of very nice lakes in this areas and the Dolomites are for me the most interesting \u201crocks\u201d, because of their shape they are quite different to the other places in the alps. \n\nI would recomend a small village to stay (to live the true dolce vita with wine and coffee all day) and then do day trips from their I dont know about hostels but in Trento (a bit bigger city with a lot of students) there should be some. And it\u2019s a great base in the middle of Trentino from where you should be able to do day trips to all the lakes and mountains. \n\nI have been there 3 times for several weeks and there is so much nice things within 3 hours radius that I still haven\u2019t seen everything. \n\nFeel free to hit me up if you want some suggestions. \n\nFeel free to hit me up if you need suggestions.",

You could instead do 2 more days in Munich or spent more days somewhere else. \n\nOnly other reason would be if you go to the areas around Salzburg (which are also quite nice but i would rather head down south)",

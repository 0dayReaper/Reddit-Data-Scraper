After doing some googling I\u2019ve found out this is a regular thing that happens all over the world. \n\nMet a girl on tinder, immediately went on a date (this is not a red flag for me, as I don\u2019t waste time on tinder, I ask for the date after the first few messages and I\u2019ve NEVER had it work against me). \n\nWent for food. \n\nShe recommended a place for drinks. \n\nTurns out this place is known for girls taking idiots like me there, to spend money on expensive bottles, and that\u2019s it. \n\nHalf way through, I knew in my heart it wasn\u2019t right, but kept going anyways. I thought the worst that was going to happen was she was going to tell me at the end of the night that she is a freelancer. \n\nTurns out she blatantly just works there, confirmed by the awkward hug at the end of the night. \n\nFeel like an idiot. I spent more money in that club, in SEA than I ever have in LONDON! I don\u2019t take L\u2019s like this. Relatively good looking and have no problem with getting women at home or abroad. But I was done an absolute kipper tonight. \n\nStay off tinder is my advice. Or go for coffee. Don\u2019t be me.",

The whole situation was weird, the girl was barely looking at me, didn't talk or just with a few messages via Google translate and she took me to this fancy club. She wanted me to pay for bottles of champagne and all. I said 'no, something cheap' and we took two gins and tonics'. Cost me 20 bucks. She didn't even say thanks or anything.

Plenty make less. Circle k pays $.75 an hour here. A meal costs $1-2 outside the tourist district.\n\nWhat would you say to a proposed tinder date at a \u00a3500-\u00a31000 restaurant in London? That is the direct comparison. \u00a310 drinks here are equivalent to \u00a370+ drinks in London. Normal/decent Viet girls don\u2019t even *drink*, that\u2019s a generalization but 97% true. Your other hint is when she looks like a supermodel in her pictures and you are average in every way, 10 years+ older than her etc. \n\nTinder is not really used here by normal girls, it\u2019s a sugar baby/prostitution/this racket platform. Greetings from Hanoi, been in Vietnam for years. Don\u2019t be a t\u00e2y ba l\u00f4 haha. Meet girls organically and you\u2019ll have the time of your life. I\u2019ve met decent girls on tinder here but they are very much the exception to the rule. Recommend you get as far away from the tourist districts as you can get and stay out!! \n\nCan I wager a guess you met up her within 200 meters of Beer Street in Hanoi??",

Going out with a foreigner for a nice meal/drinks and some casual sex is completely different. I once met a doctor in Eastern Europe who took me on a day trip to the countryside and then rode saddle off me in a nice little cabin she rented. Then she dropped me back at my hostel and that was it. Since she was considerably wealthier than me, did she take advantage of me? \n\n2nd: Bro there is no prostitute in this story. She is essentially a promo girl who flirts with foreigners on the guise of romance/sex to get them to spend money at the bar she works at to get a cut. It\u2019s a scam.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong it totally comes with the territory of travelling to poorer places, but it sucks and OP didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Lotta victim blaming going on itt",

Make sure to establish a place of your choosing, if they insist you have to go to a specific bar, yea you're just a customer. Aside from that, dating in Vietnam is pretty positive in my experience. Vietnam is also a fairly conservative country, so not many first dates will be \\*just\\* going out for drinks, generally, although it varies.",

In many places, men don't need to pay directly for sex.

If you continue to roam around Tindering, you should get used to the fact that a good number of the women you meet are going have agendas that are counter to your interests.",

If you're truly seeking rest and reflection, seeking out random encounters with women in places where you're just a tourist is not a good way of finding it. As you've learned, you will be a target. A lot of the women targeting you will be much more savvy than you, and some of them are looking for a much bigger score than some overpriced drinks. Since you've already mentioned Thailand, you might want to read up on that. I'll give you a preview: a lot of guys go to Thailand and end up in situations and entanglements. They think they're cool and then they get in way over their heads.\n2. When visiting a new city, don't waste your time swiping and texting when you could be out exploring.\n3. Consider finding a base and getting settled in before you start dating. You will make yourself a lot more attractive to the good people when you can honestly state that you're not just passing through.\n4. Stop thinking in terms of \"winning\" and \"losing\". This isn't a game.\n5. If you choose to continue this lifestyle, don't complain about the inevitable consequences.",

The alcohol was ridiculously expensive and of course I paid for everything. I dropped like 200 eur. The date was so awkward, the conversation was like pulling teeth as she barely spoke english and looked up from her phone the whole night. We ended up going to a club that her \"friend\" worked at where we awkwardly danced for an hour or so.\n\nIronically enough, she invited me back to her place where I was sure I was gonna get mugged but we ended up having sex that evening and in the morning and she even paid for the Uber and accompanied me on the way back to my hostel.\n\nDefinitely in my top 5 weird solo travel experiences haha. Not sure if I was lucky or what.",

    "postText": "So here's the background. A few months ago I took a term of culinary classes because I wanted to have the classic \"college experience\" some sort of social awakening that would finally make me normal and social. I have struggled to make friends for basically my whole life, and I hoped i would go to college and make a ton of awesome friends and party all the time and finally enjoy life. This did not happen, I went to college and it was cripplingly lonely, I struggled to make any friends, and parties were completely beyond me. I got involved in as much as I could, I was working, joined the esports team for a tuition waiver, joined the music club, ice carving team, culinary team, and then had regular classes, my schedule was filled, and yet I made very few friends. It felt like nothing changed and I still didn't fit in anywhere. I learned a lot as far as schooling, but realized the knowledge I was getting was overpriced, and I wasn't sure it was the path I wanted to take, so I finished the term and went back home. Didn't know what to do and eventually solo travel came to mind, a lot of my family has done a lot of traveling and recommended it to me. I thought again maybe this would be my social butterfly experience and i would finally break out of my shell. I decided to go to iceland, I heard it was safe, people are friendly, and the views are gorgeous. I would rent a car and sleep in it at campsites across the island. I did a lot of planning on what i would bring and how I would save money, but not a lot of planning on what i would do. Once i got to iceland, i started to panic a bit, I was in the airport and had no idea what I was doing, thought if I could just get to the hostel I would be ok, so I skipped everything as far as a sim card or buying food or water in the airport, I just took the bus and got dropped off in the middle of the city, and with no internet access i had no idea where to go. A normal person would probably have just asked a stranger for directions, but that was utterly terrifying to me, and I basically just wandered around until I found some free wifi and located the way to the hostel. Things were OK from that point, but I didn't really make any good friends, I just was keeping afloat basically. I eventually got an esim and my car and began spending a lot of time on my phone looking up things to see, going to them, and then completing whatever hike it was, repeat. Staying alone in my car and doing a bunch of hikes alone, while it is rewarding in its own right, it can be very lonely. Fast forward to the end of my trip, I have since made a few friends, but nothing crazy, eventually I decided that it would be cool to book a ticket to Rome on a whim, so that's what I did. I am now in rome, and it was even worse than before. People don't speak much English here, so the thought of talking to strangers is even more terrifying. I eventually made my way to the hostel, and I have spent pretty much all my time in the hostel. I am so scared to talk to anyone in the city that I've barely gone outside, and heaven forbid I go and find a place to get food. I took one stroll around the city and it was cool to see some of the architecture, but the thought of stepping into a shop and trying to buy food is just idk, it's almost like it's not worth it to me. I feel like saying it terrified me, but I don't really feel scared to do it, I just can't bring myself to. I need to use public transportation to get to my next hostel, but I have no idea how public transportation works as a whole, I live in a small town in oregon, so I am not used to this at all. I feel so alone, so out of place, I kind of wish I had just booked a plane ticket back home and never came here. I feel so stupid for not having an incredible experience like everyone is expecting me to. Everyone tells me I'm so brave for doing this, and I'm going to have an incredible time, and everyone is so jealous, and I'm going to make so many friends, but none of that has happened. I have been so alone in my own bubble, too afraid to do something as simple as go out and buy food. As long as I have my phone I can research how to get places, but I don't know how I am going to survive like this. I just feel so awful about all of it. I want to have an incredible experience like everyone talks about, and everyone is expecting from me but I am just falling apart, i feel so useless, so out of place, idk, I just feel so pathetic.",

            "comment": "Hey, InfernoLemon, it looks like you are writing about possible mental health issues. As always, a reminder that for people struggling with mental health, solo travel is not a substitute for professional help--and that the stress of travel (unfamiliar surroundings/languages, culture shock, lack of a support network) can sometimes exacerbate these issues. If you are experiencing a genuine mental health crisis, please reach out to your nearest crisis centre/counselor/hotline. Meanwhile, we have an [excellent post about solo travel and mental health](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/mentalhealth) in our Wiki that you might find worth reading.",

It\u2019s like wanting to have bigger biceps and then only laying on the floor of the gym every day wondering why nothing is happening.\n\nEven in my thirties, I find it\u2019s rare that I make more than one halfway-decent acquaintance each time I travel. I have interesting interactions with people here and there, but I\u2019m not returning home with some big entourage of overseas admirers.\n\nYour first enemy is unrealistic expectations. If you\u2019re morbidly socially awkward at home, expecting to become a social dynamo just because you\u2019re in another country is nothing more than premeditated disappointment on your part.\n\nWhat you CAN do is take advantage of being somewhere no one knows you to TRY to work through that awkwardness. Someone finds your attempt to talk to them to be off-putting? Oh well, who cares, you\u2019ll never see them again, onto the next person. Maybe you\u2019ll even eventually find someone with a few of the same interests. \n\nIf your only expectation from travel is that it will instantly change you into the opposite of who you are at home without any work on your part, then that\u2019s not going to go well for you. Change your mentality about what\u2019s realistic for you to attain, and why you\u2019re travelling to begin with.",

Like I'm struggling because my expectations are too high and my standards for myself are too demanding, and I need to take advantage of my situation and recognize that none of the people I meet will actually matter because I will never see them again. Like that's a very clear thing to recognize and I can see that, but to actually switch my mentality and to just expect less, have lower standards, stop caring what others think so much. Idk maybe it's different for others but I just can't seem to flip that switch in my head, and it's very frustrating to feel powerless against my own emotions",

Like sentence for sentence I was nodding my head, \"yup, that is what it is like. You are correct.\"  It is OPs assumptions that it would be something different, and that they would be someone different, that made it painful. Well, that and their age and socialization in a culture that is increasingly isolated, and increasingly uncomfortable with the unadulterated, real-time world. Which is both vast and wildly indifferent to the needs of.....well, anyone.\n\nOP there is nothing wrong with you, or your plan or even your \"mistakes.\" You are doing something new. And it is awesome (in the literal definition). Learning shit like this is why I wouldn't give back any of my solo trips - even the hard lonely ones. Now you know to get a sim card at the airport, and write key addresses / numbers down, and to maybe pack snacks. This is good information. \n\nAlso, for the future:\n\n1. You will spend way more of your time on logistics than you thought. Increase this exponentially for off the beaten path travel.\n2. Contemplative solo days will drastically outnumber social windfalls days when you sit next to a random future-friend on the bus.\n3. Making friends is a learnable skill. And takes emotional fortitude. Sometimes you cry. You'll get better at it. It helps when you fully accept that different people do it differently and that not everyone is for everybody.",

But it's not just about mentality; it's about building up experiences and skills.\n\nWhen I embarked on my first solo trip, I was in Bangkok. To be honest, I felt exactly the same way you're feeling now. It was incredibly overwhelming. The city was bustling, I was alone, and I couldn't even leave my room for more than an hour or two initially. My culinary experiences were limited to 7/11 because I was too nervous to order local food.\n\nBut here's the crucial part: I came with the expectation that I would have to start from scratch. I knew I was a beginner in this, and I didn't expect to become an expert overnight. I knew I had to slowly build my confidence and skills. I took small steps each day. I started with confidently ordering food from local stalls, then learning a new word or phrase in Thai each day, and gradually I began to interact more with people around me.\n\nOver time, these small wins built up. I didn't instantly overcome my fears, but I did learn to manage them. It was less about changing my mentality and more about learning through experiences and building confidence along the way. \n\nI recommend to stay grounded in one area and take it slow.",

Most of this fear is coming from within, so remove one external sensory factor (noise of an unfamiliar city), throw on one of your favourite albums, and let it be your soundtrack. I find music helps me tune out the world and creates a tonal atmosphere I echo in my step / how I interact.\n\n\nYou're in Rome, which is one of the biggest tourist destinations on the planet, so you're hardly the only one who can't speak Italian. Don't worry about it, because to them, you're just another tourist anyways. Seen it a million times. Everyone else is an NPC right now, anyways. You won't even remember they exist by the time you leave. Right now you're having trouble flipping that switch in your head because you're hyper fixated on your anxiety, and that always causes it to snowball in a self perpetuating manner. \n\n\nStep one is to stop fixating. Do a reset on your brain. Some people do yoga, or meditate. Personally that doesn't work for me, but you know what is really good at getting the jitters out? A shot. Literally any shot of liquor. Just one! One won't get you drunk, but it's just enough to lower that inhibition that is currently in overdrive. Sometimes just a small kick like that can really do the trick, and in my case, it tends to only need to happen once to reset my brain I to a more outgoing and carefree mindset for the rest of the trip. Sometimes when I arrive, I'm overwhelmed and nervous because my brain is racing between all the unknowns, so I take a night to chill, have a long shower, get good rest, then the next day, have a shot, go outside, less nervous, then I realize everything is fine and the whole reason I came here was because it's full of unknowns waiting to be discovered and I'm a fuckin dope badass so why tf do I need to worry about what anyone else thinks? \n\n\nStep two? Hellllllla friendly smile. I make myself approachable as fuck, am super curious about things, will ask questions and even if we don't speak the same language, much hilarity ensues with international sharades. I find people in general are super excited by foreigners who are really excited about them / their culture and you don't need to speak a lick of the same language to do it. Sometimes language barriers are isolating so I just do what I'd do if I was deaf and get animated, lol. Always seems to get a great response, kind of infectious. The gist is, if you radiate curiosity and friendliness even if you have to fake it till you make it, it can really have a serious impact on your confidence and experience because you can trick your brain into internalizing it. \n\n\nI always like to start with music. I can't help but relax a bit. Then something to ease my nerves. I don't drink, either, so I don't mean to like, go get trashed lol. But one shot can do a looooot without doing much to you at all.",

But I figured it was the more commonly available option (personally I will literally just take half a molly, but I don't generally just open with drugs, lmao). The point is more to recognize that sometimes a very responsibly applied boost can help. Everyone is going to be different. Also for the record I'm not neurotypucal, but this goes back to people being responsible and exercising judgements in regards to what is safe and will work for them.",

                            "comment": "I hate to pile on on the ego point - especially because as someone with a bigger ego than anyone on the Internet (see?), I know firsthand exactly what kind of perception and reception issues we have - but the commenter is correct. And you should consider yourself blessed that you are having this crisis at the age of 18 - which well within the universally accepted time frame to have this crisis - and not at the age of 28, which is around when I suffered through that crisis. And I say \"suffer\" because for every day that you go on living like this, you are truly suffering.  \n\nYou feel lonely because you find no way to connect. And you find no way to connect because you are so focused on yourself and your own perspective of things, that you fail to realize that the other 7,999,999,999 people on this earth *also* have a perspective. And that perspective of others, believe it or not, is probably more positive than you realize.  \n\nThink about the perspective that others may have, of some 18 year old kid coming to their country because they want to experience something different. And maybe you can speak some Italian, hopefully you can at least say hello and thank you and goodbye, but the point is *if other people see you actively trying to participate in their culture, you WILL be welcomed with open arms**. Period. Unless your destination is Sentinel Island, you will be welcomed and embraced simply for the fact of participating in good faith.  \n\nBut the problem is, **you HAVE to participate, and that participation HAS to be in good faith**. So that means taking three months or a month or even just two weeks and learning some Italian before you go. That means stepping outside of your hotel room and asking someone where they like to have lunch. And then once they tell you, you go there, and you use your Google Translate on your phone to take pictures of the menu to translate it if you have to. And it means you ask the waiter what their favorite dish is. And if it's not something you already despise (for instance, I will NEVER order something with creme fraiche), that means you order it and you eat it.   \n\nAnd you either like it or you don't like it, but guess what? Now you know you like Flammkuchen. Now you know you don't much care for Haehnchenschnitzel, but you might possibly try another type of Schnitzel later. Now you know that any time you order a Broetchen with any type of meat in it, you're in business. Now you know that if all else fails, you can literally just find a street vendor and order Pommes mit Ketchup bitte, because believe it or not, French fries are kind of its own meal in Germany if you want it to be.   \n\nDo you see what I mean? Over the course of two weeks, I went from \"Jesus Christ, I literally don't even know where to begin with this menu, let me translate the entire thing and figure out what I want to eat before I even leave the hotel\", to now I just sit down at a restaurant with their German language menu, read it all in German, figure out what I want in German, tell the waiter what I want in German, and eat my delicious food - also in German. Granted, I still had to sit in my hotel room and search for thirty minutes before I felt comfortable finding a place to eat (to be fair, my stomach was also completely WRECKED from the time zone switch and travel food, so I wanted to intentionally find something healthy), but I DID IT. And what's crazy is that everyone was super fucking nice, all I had to do was ask the waitress to speak a little more slowly and everything went down in German.  \n\nAnd that was the day I realized, people are people no matter where you go.    \n\nYou have to overcome the fear of living life, if ever you actually want to live the fulfilling life that you dream of. And just as a side note, dropping video games down to less than one hour a day WILL produce immediate results in terms of dropping the ego and being able to engage more thoroughly and healthily with others in real life.",

You probably remember the layout \u2014 you remember where you picked up some apples, you remember where the checkout lanes were. \n\nDo you remember what the other customers looked like? What they were wearing? What about the person who rang up your items?\n\nAlmost certainly not. \n\nEven if something horribly embarrassing happened, like some dude slipped on a wet floor and crashed into a display of candy bars, would you recognize him on the street the next day?  I doubt it. \n\nSo if you aren\u2019t paying attention to what other people look like or what they\u2019re doing, don\u2019t you think the same is true of most everyone else?\n\nVirtually no one is passing judgment on you. Are you passing judgment on everyone else? No, because you aren\u2019t paying attention to them. They\u2019re just faceless people you\u2019re passing. \n\nPeople are focused on themselves, and what they\u2019re doing. No one is looking at you or judging what you\u2019re doing. They aren\u2019t thinking \u201cLook at this guy, he doesn\u2019t speak Italian and he\u2019s not walking right and doesn\u2019t know where he\u2019s going,\u201d or whatever fears are popping up in your mind.\n\nAgain: Do *you* do this with every one of the thousands of people you\u2019re passing by? No. \n\nAs for figuring out aspects of how the country works, you have access to the internet. Not all that long ago, it was a hundred times harder to figure these things out. If you need to know how the bus system works, there\u2019s tons of websites that will walk you through it step by step. If you\u2019re trying to ride the trains, there\u2019s a Trenitalia app where you can book your ticket. \n\nShow up, look at the board for your train number, and go wait at that platform. If you aren\u2019t sure about something, guess what? There\u2019s employees all over the place who do absolutely nothing all day but answer questions. They are *absolutely* not judging you. \n\nAnd if you mess something up and sit in the wrong seat or something, no one will remember!\n\nI know it\u2019s easier said than done, but *you* are controlling what you\u2019re thinking about. You\u2019re in charge of your own thoughts. When you start spiraling around these sorts of anxious thoughts, just consciously steer the ship somewhere else. \n\nYou\u2019ve got this. Rome is awesome, Italy is awesome. And as far as foreign countries go, it\u2019s a piece of cake. There\u2019s tourists everywhere, the locals are used to tourists \u2014 and believe me, after covid they\u2019re super happy to have you there.",

                                            "comment": "So here\u2019s the deal, and this is my own take after traveling solo and for business all over the world. You are currently very wrapped up in your own expectations and plans for what you thought this to be like and now you are very stressed that it\u2019s not happening. Being a social butterfly doesn\u2019t mean what you\u2019re expecting here, other people respond to a few basic things - but #1 is confidence. Even if it\u2019s fake, be confident in yourself. Everything else builds off of your own confidence in what you are doing. You cannot be comfortable around others until you\u2019re comfortable being by yourself and doing what you want. Lack of confidence in yourself is literally visibly apparent to others through your mannerisms and body language so in order to make others comfortable you need to be confident.\n\nNow you\u2019re a tourist in Rome - idk what you expected but generally people don\u2019t fly to a strange place on the other side of the planet and make a whole bunch of friends - 25 years I\u2019ve been traveling and I can count on one hand the # of people I still talk to I\u2019ve met along the way - and I am what you would describe as a social butterfly. You need to reset your expectations on what I means to show up as a visitor by yourself to a place no one knows you and don\u2019t speak their language. Drop the notion you will meet new friends and get rid of that expectation. If it happens, that\u2019s a bonus, but expect the opposite. This is literally your perfect opportunity to build your confidence in yourself. You\u2019re in the home of the great philosophers, they\u2019ve written a thing or two about this topic, especially the stoics.\n\nLastly I\u2019ll leave you with this. There are social things people do with their own friends, family, or alone by themselves. Then there are social things people do with the intention of doing it with strangers. Sounds to me like you\u2019re trying or expecting people to want to socialize in settings that just aren\u2019t built for engaging with a stranger. For example, it\u2019s very odd to approach or meet someone at a restaurant, or the beach unless you\u2019re an amazing volleyball player or something- that\u2019s a social situation where you don\u2019t generally meet or interact with a lot of strangers even though it\u2019s crowded. That\u2019s personal social time. Now a night club, that\u2019s a social setting where being a stranger from a strange land WILL get you some attention if only for a moment, and that\u2019s where confidence takes over to keep the game going. \n\nReset your expectations - you are in Rome, rent an atv and go see all the architecture, museums, eat fancy food, drink good wine, sit on the beach and read a book on philosophy, but experience Rome for yourself, by yourself.\n\nUntil you are confident in being yourself by yourself, you\u2019re not going to enjoy what you are doing and no amount of \u201cnew friends\u201d will change that, in fact you won\u2019t make them because humans really only respond to a few things and confidence is #1.",

If you haven\u2019t been social your entire life than a new event or program won\u2019t change it. More than anything, you should cut yourself a brake and maybe do some inward traveling to find contentment with who you are. Therapy helps social anxiety but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re broken and ill. Could just be an environmental response. The fact that you went on your own and experienced this uncertainty and new place really does take courage. You went somewhere were you can\u2019t relate to anything and are trying your best to vibe. That\u2019s what is take to actually live life. Facing uncertainty and something new and allowing yourself to feel whatever it brings. \nYou are stronger than everyone who is/was too afraid to leave their hometown.",

I truly recommend seeing the Trevi fountain though! Also write a journal. Put all your thoughts down on paper is a really amazing way to get these thoughts out.

And so is what fourbums said about his mother fondly remembering a trip where she freaked out the whole time.  I still remember crying trying to figure out how to call home in multiple countries when I went solo backpacking in the mid-90s. I was a recent widow and I thought I would get away from my nervous breakdown abroad but it came everywhere I did, and I so cherish those memories and laugh about them now. I was such a hot mess, but at least I was the hottest mess in front of people I'll never see again. (if only I could say that for the rest of my 20s!)\n\nAlso, I definitely think it was easier to make impromptu travel buddies for my generation because we grew up having to interact face-to-face. Despite that, and despite being an introvert, I would still get desperately lonely at times resulting in my many payphone meltdowns. \n\nBut this last point made me think, I know you probably dreamed of having lots of fantastic social experiences with people your own age, but perhaps you might try signing up for some local tours (Viator or toursbylocals) and perhaps build up with interactions you know will only last that day. Most of the folks on these tours will probably be older than you, but that's ok. And you may be able to ask your tour guide some questions about how they do different things in their country. Believe me, tour guides get asked tons of stupid questions every day and most of them are really good natured about answering them and have a genuine love for sharing their culture.",

Here's an AWESOME video that I found when I was actually researching if I wanted anxiety pills. This is what your physician should sound like. The first video I watched was him explaining the different anxiety pills and how they're a last resort, and that got me into his first line of defense suggestions that were just way better options.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fsky5WShpN8\n\n We're talking yoga, even 5 minutes of meditation, breathing stuff.

By a six pack of any cold beer you find around the hostel, bring it close to the people hanging out, wait for them to stop talking, and just ask politely.\n\n\"Hey.

Introduce yourself when you get a chance, but focus on listening to their stories and interacting with them, being honest or making fun comments about the things they talk about. If they ask you about yourself, talk about all the cool things you've seen so far.\n\nYou got this. Just allow yourself to make some mistakes. If it doesn't work at first, try it again later or in a different hostel.\nTravellers are usually very friendly, all you need to do is start the interaction by being nice and take it from there.",

Some learn to fake it to fit in better, some find it less effort to just be themselves.\n\nI'm not sure from your post if you truly want to be an extrovert or if you think you should be one because of external expectations/pressure.\n\nIn any case: Throw away what everyone is expecting of you, it doesn't matter. Who the hell cares what others think (they'll be jealous and amazed you got to see Italy and Iceland anyways). Ask yourself what would make this incredible for you? Why not just read a book sitting on the trevi fountain or people/fashion watch at the colosseum. No need to do \"the typical thing\". Whatever you do, do what makes you the most happy not what you think others expect.\n\nTraveling can be great for discovering how you want to handle social interactions if you are in the right head space.. which is not always easy. I think this is what you're thinking off when referring to the social butterfly effect of traveling. But it doesn't come by itself... It's a lot of trial &amp;error.\n\nThe way I see it is: when I'm solo-traveling I get a do-over every day. One day I can pretend to be the obnoxious overbearing ass that inserts herself everywhere. The next I'm the shy person that talks to noone. \nThen I can try out my ice breakers and see who is truly receptive to my intro/jokes or if nobody takes me up on it. \nI get to do all the stuff I'm too afraid to do back home because I have to worry about what others might think and how it'll affect my social group and reputation. But at the hostel, I know I'll never see any of these people again if we don't exchange numbers. Here's your chance to royally fuck up, offend everyone in a 5mile radius and have zero consequences because you move 10miles away two days later.\n\nThe truth is I've had some amazing friendships while traveling. Great people that were a joy to travel with but none of these friendships really lasted after going home. I did however become very adapt of just ignoring social decorum and inserting myself in groups and conversations. A lot of people believe I'm a social butterfly because I'll be in a discu within 5min of walking into a room full of strangers.. but 99% of that is just me finding the group that's most likely to let me join and walk up saying \"hi I'm berries I'm new here\". If they give me weird looks and kinda ignore me, I move on and try again.\n\nTo make things easier with talking to people: I did mostly stick to the people in the hostels because I knew they were more likely to be looking for someone and more likely to be speaking English. if you're into cooking: the kitchen is always a good spot to meet fellow-minded people\n\nEdit: also not every location is a hit.. I hit a rough spot in central America a few years back where, for 3 months, I couldn't find a single person I was really feeling a vibe with. Sometimes it happens and it sucks. Nothing you can do really but to keep on trying.\n\nAnd I want to repeat one last time: screw what everyone else's expectations are. Ask yourself what you want. I'm sure you can still have a great time in Italy (you can also ask for recommendations on how to best prepare/what apps to download/what simcard to get here) but if you look inside and realize you're tired of being overwhelmed and just wanna go home, that's legit too (and don't listen to that voice asking what your friends/family will think about it; they'll be happy to see you back)",

I will say, I find it really easy to just strike up a conversation with people in a hostel who are around my age and speak the same language, but like anything past that is just impossible. And like I am very very worried about what people will think of me back home, even though I know they probably will think the best no matter what, there's just like a lingering thought of needing to enjoy the trip to the full extent because everyone expects that of me, even when I know that's not true, it's hard to get rid of those feelings.",

Ask where is the nearest supermarket, cos you need to eat!! Go to tourist information office and ask for a map or bus information, just to have an interaction and start getting comfortable again.\n\nBook some activities, have you tried GetYourGuide app? I booked almost everything through that recently, and I always found someone to talk to on each activity.\n\nI know people keep telling you this and you don't feel it, but you are brave, just the act of doing what you're doing is going to be incredibly formative for you. You cant see it now, because you're 18, but girrrrl, I was like you at 18 and I never would have had the balls to do what you're doing... and I suffered for it. You're showing a strength of character and and attitude to life that is very impressive. But 'failure' (perceived in your case, because your not really failing) is a fact of life, it's pretty much mandatory to collect failures (real and perceived) on your way to improvement, you HAVE to fail in order to succeed. Your getting started so early, I'm really proud of you :)\n\nedit: also if you do start getting great at talking to people, you might find yourself with the opposite problem where your trying to shake them off and make excuses so you can be by yourself for a damn minute \ud83d\ude02",

You\u2019ve hopped on an airplane and flown across the world to countries where people don\u2019t speak English. And you\u2019re 18. Pretty incredible. You really should be proud of yourself to be honest. \n\nTwo things I can recommend. Set mini goals for yourself.  You\u2019re in your hostel. Seriously just walk outside and order and coffee and go back to your room. That\u2019s all you gotta do. Then you can slowly build on this. A walk around the block. Back to the room. It can be so overwhelming to try to take on a whole new world at once. But you feel safe in the hostel and it\u2019s right there. Then when you\u2019re ready, walk two blocks. Back to the room. These little achievements are actually so rewarding. I had to do this in India my first time and it worked so well. Two a couple of days but by day 3 I was really comfortable and wow it felt like a huge achievement. Also, It could actually be just culture shock. You\u2019re from a small town in Oregon. Rome is a big busy city. You feel small in it. That\u2019s really understandable. But. Embrace it a bit. Nobody is gonna remember you. They all have lives they\u2019re living and believe it or not their own worries too. I seriously feel like this whole experience will be ultimately rewarding and you will travel again.

At that age I thought I should be out clubbing and enjoying that and at some point I realized I'm an introvert and that is not enjoyable for me. So figure out what you really want to be doing. If deep down you are an outgoing person, I agree that you should seek therapy. You're so young and have time to work on it.",

But I didn't really learn those social skills when I was young, and it's made it difficult for me to try and figure those things out now that I'm older. But there are definitely things that I think I should enjoy that I feel guilty for not enjoying, clubbing is a good example. A few days ago in iceland I went with some people from a hostel who decided to go clubbing and I went with\nAs soon as I walked inside the club and there was loud music and people jumping up and down around me. I stood there awkwardly for like a minute and then left. It wasn't like I was terribly anxious or anything, I just didn't really get the point. It didn't seem really interesting for me to just move around in a big crowd and not actually talk or connect with anyone. I'm not really a dancer, that's something I also don't really understand. But I felt so guilty for not enjoying it when all of the people I just met were. The night ended up pretty good though, one of the older guys got tired of it and he met up with me and we just walked around the city and had a really great talk, so that was a pretty good turn around. But yeah, I think I often put pressure on myself to be like a party-goer frat house dancing queen when I could never become that because I just don't really enjoy being social without actually having deeper connection",

you\u2019ll look back on it knowing you survived something really hard without much support and you\u2019ll end up feeling quite proud of yourself, even though it wasn\u2019t what you expected at all. \n\ntravelling solo is often (but not always) EXTREMELY lonely. you\u2019re very young, and most people in hostels are going to be a few years older than you with more experience doing this. it\u2019s not always fun to travel unfortunately. i almost always travel solo, and i\u2019ve found that some of the places i was most excited to go were monumentally disappointing for a bunch of reasons but some of them included that i caught a really severe travel bug, or i got really sick of being alone and just wanted to be with my friends, or i felt really self conscious and shy and didn\u2019t approach a group of people mingling in a hostel bar and lost my one opportunity to meet people in that trip, which led to the trip feeling even lonelier. all of this and more happened to me in rome, i had the WORST experience in italy generally and i was really sad about it too. the one good thing about rome is that it\u2019s possible to just wander around and you\u2019ll stumble upon so many amazing monuments and attractions that you don\u2019t even really need to plan. \nmy first big solo europe trip was actually quite different to what i expected as well and i have a lot of regrets about parts of it - there were so many places where i did no research, i just showed up in a city and started walking around, went to a couple of monuments or museums, and went back to my hostel feeling a bit bored and dejected. other places were the complete opposite, where i didn\u2019t have to research a thing and it all just went smoothly on its own. \n\nget yourself a sim card - last time i was in europe i used 3 Mobile and just got a prepaid plan that i could top up as needed. had coverage pretty much everywhere. \nhostels are actually the best place to meet people while travelling solo as there tends to be a lot of people in similar situations, and if you buddy up with even one person for a day, they might be able to take some of the pressure off from working out how to do things/talking to strangers in shops etc. if you\u2019re not comfortable with approaching a random person in a common room or hostel bar, try having a chat with the hostel staff. hostels often get travellers to work at the bar to pay for their stay, or at least get locals who have travelled before to work there. that means 1) these people know the stress of solo travelling 2) have learned over time how to navigate new places where they don\u2019t speak your language 3) they are literally there to help you. i would approach someone at reception, explain your situation, make it clear it\u2019s a mental health difficulty that\u2019s stopping you from just ripping off the band-aid and doing what you know you should do, and ask them for help with whatever you think will benefit you. sometimes it\u2019s just organising transport or recommending a tour, sometimes it\u2019s asking them to help introduce you to people. hostel staff are usually wonderful resources and very friendly and kind. \n\nin terms of actually seeing the places you\u2019re going to without having to stress about organising things:\nlook on websites like viator, tripadvisor, booking.com, kayak etc. for guided group tours. these can be within the city, like sandemans walking tours or an art gallery tour, or they can be day trips or multi-day trips outside the city. this is a great way to see things without having to organise anything yourself. it won\u2019t really get you off the beaten path of tourist locations but that\u2019s okay, it\u2019s how i did my first solo europe trip and it was still incredible. on guided tours, you can choose whether you want to mingle or keep to yourself and just enjoy the sights. nobody will be bothered by you keeping to yourself, but because you\u2019re in a group it is much easier to talk to people. most of them will speak english, and the group setting has been manufactured for you, so you don\u2019t have to approach strangers in hostels or anything. \n\nif you need any other tips let me know. you\u2019re welcome to message me and i can try give you more advice if you don\u2019t want it on this thread. \nit\u2019s very normal to have a rough time while travelling though! you aren\u2019t weird or useless or pathetic for that - its not an easy thing to do at all. it gets a bit easier once you know all the tips n tricks though and you\u2019ll learn them as you go! you\u2019re doing great, all things considered.",

Reasonable expectations for yourself.

Not very romantic solo traveling like jetting off to Europe, but it's help me figure out how I travel best before trying to go somewhere more intense. \n\nA few other commenters mentioned setting expectations, and I get that therapy helps but not everyone has access, so I thought this anecdote might help put that into context or give you ideas.

Yeah honestly when I was exploring iceland, I quickly realized how similar it was to oregon, maybe I just had too high of expectations bit I felt like I wasn't \"wowed\" so much as I thought I would be because I had seen bigger and cooler stuff in oregon. Once you see one big waterfall they're all kind of the same \ud83d\ude05. I honestly was thinking to myself It would have been better and made more sense financially to take a road trip around the pacific northwest, and I think that something I would like to plan for and do in the future, because honest oregon and the surrounding states are really incredible.

I have demolished my social anxiety and crippling shyness to the point where i now travel the world solo and have great connections with people - both men and women.

            "comment": "Hey man. In my experience, travel is not a way to make friends. Particularly if you\u2019re not an outgoing person to begin with. I have stayed in hostels multiple times and never made a friend, because I don\u2019t really talk to other people because I\u2019m introverted. I much prefer my own company. If you\u2019re not an outgoing person at home, you won\u2019t be whilst travelling. \n\nThat being said, it sounds like you\u2019re struggling a bit. When I feel like that while I\u2019m travelling, I tell myself, if I go out and do x thing, I will let myself go back to the hotel and relax for the rest of the day. Often I enjoy my day out and it\u2019s ok. But actually leaving my hotel at the start of the day is a challenge. I have anxiety surrounding leaving the house/feeling trapped and unable to escape so travelling is a big, big challenge for me. I have panic attacks in supermarkets in my home country because it\u2019s so overwhelming so travel is a lot. But if I can do it, you can it, I promise. Just break things up into one step at a time ie go out to buy some snacks. Then once you\u2019ve done that, look up how to get the bus to x thing. Then once you\u2019ve done that, take a walk to the bus stop, you don\u2019t even have to get on the bus if you don\u2019t want. Etc etc.\n\nAlso, it kinda sounds like you might be experiencing depression? I could be wrong, but it might be something to look into.",

            "comment": "Everyone on here is giving great advice, so the only thing I can think to add is that the culture shock is not making your situation any easier. Even as an experienced traveller, I get the same nerves and anxiety sometimes about being somewhere unfamiliar, or not being understood and not speaking the language. Best thing I can do is honestly force myself to go out, to achieve something small, it might just be to get a coffee and come back, or go to the supermarket. The more I achieve small tasks, and walk around, the more I get familiar with my surroundings and get more comfortable with where I am. You're also forced to have maybe one interaction to achieve the small task, and if it goes alright, it gives you confidence to try something else next. \n  \nPlenty of people in Rome speak English. It's a massive tourist hub, so lots of locals speak English, plus then you have all the tourists too. Italians will try and help if you ask them questions, but they can also be more direct and straightforward than you might be used to which can sometimes seem negative if you're not used to it. Italians will also be stoked if you speak English but say buongiorno/buonasera at the start, and grazie (GRAT-see-eh) and ciao at the end. Actually, most countries will be stoked to hear you making some small effort in their language. If you're super worried though, google translate is super useful, and if you don't want to use data, you can download languages for use offline. \n  \nYou're also on holiday. You can literally do anything you want. Sure, you can see some of the touristy things if you want. You can also sit in the park or a cafe and read. I don't know about you, but I always want to do this relaxing stuff when I'm at home and never have time, so travelling for me a mixture of sightseeing/being very busy, and then relaxing/being very lazy. There's no right or wrong way to travel, life is not an edited and filtered vlog.\n  \nYou have a lot of struggles to start with, but please keep in mind that travelling honestly isn't easy all the time. Take a deep breath and achieve one small thing, whether it's asking someone at the hostel if they want to grab dinner or get a coffee, joining a free walking tour, or just ordering a coffee or some food for yourself. It gets easier every time.\n\nI think you have a lot of high expectations on yourself to be perfect and amazing and extroverted 100% of the time, and that honestly sounds exhausting and possibly not even your personality anyway. You gotta do you, not do what you think other people do. Travelling is a great way to figure out yourself, but it does take effort and energy. \n  \nFeel free to message me if you need any tips about Rome or Italy in general, you're in a fantastic location if you can let yourself relax. Let Italy happen to you :)",

You said you spent 1 term at college, but I didn't really come out of my shell until junior year of college. After that I moved to Japan and although I met some very good friends in the first couple weeks, I experienced that same anxiety with going out to try and get food at a restaurant or try to interact with strangers. It takes time, exposure, and celebrating small victories. The first time I ate out at a restaurant alone I celebrated myself (especially since this act is seen as weird in america on it's own, but now I looooove going out to eat by myself). Then I kept going out of my comfort zone little by little and celebrating each time. Traveling is all about getting out of your comfort zone, so I encourage you to keep pushing that boundary little by little so smaller things like going to a restaurant or cafe seem easy after a while. I totally understand that desire to have all those skills immediately in some karmic event, but like all other skills, travelling and getting out of your comfort zone is a skill that needs to be practiced and honed. Whatever you do, don't feel like a failure because your trip didn't go as planned because no trip ever does.",

You didn't wake up one day and was amazing at those things, you had to start small and get better over time with great effort and practice. \n\nYou're staying in a hostel, that's great, is there a common area? Go hang out in common area with some beer if you drink, or just some dinner. If someone else is there say hi. that's it, nothing more complex than that. maybe a nothing-comment about the weather. if you're feeling really brave ask if they know how to use the public transportation because it's new to you. \n\n&gt; I want to have an incredible experience like everyone talks about \n\nThe thing about \"incredible experiences\" is you don't realise you're in one until it's over.

Expectation, Planning to work on my mental health while there, having a routine and a (home thing) Knick knack that\u2019s important to me to look at that I travel with all the time and other helpful tricks. \n\nI left because my mental health was being starved where I was, my heart was being starved. I hated where I was mentally and physically. I got out and I did the work and felt way better and I\u2019ve been traveling since then and now, at 27 on my 14th country. Travel helps, but not everyone and not in the same ways.  \n\nIf you just go on a trip, thinking that you\u2019re going to go from zero to hero overnight you\u2019re gonna be disappointed. There are definitely steps to take to become more social, but what are you hoping to gain from becoming a social butterfly?\n\nI\u2019ve had to learn how to enjoy my own company do things that are pleasing to me and enjoyable, and make me feel super awesome all my own now because I can\u2019t find people to do things with but because when I do think of other people, there are too many restrictions on what I do to enjoy myself when plans change I get really upset When I\u2019m constantly with other people on trips I am doing what they wanna do on their time in their car it\u2019s not fun, for me at least . \n\nGet clear on why you want to become a social butterfly. Is it to find intimate relationships? Is it just to have more friends to do things with or is it to feel less lonely, or something else, whatever the reason is there are definitely smaller steps to getting there other than just going on a trip.",

Go talk to them - both of u will become happy and you eventually join the extrovert gang.\n\nAlso, drink alcohol man ( but do not overdoit ) one shot + a beer then stop. WIll make you breaver  \n\n\n  \nTbh I suffer with something similar as you do and the travelling and culture shocks is what actually helps me.  I was 18 when I did my first \"long road\" ... I was scared. At 19 I was already sleeping wasted on the streets of amsterdam.  At 22 I was looking for drugs in thailand. Now at 25 I became a resident of brasil which was funny cuz they dont do english at all so I went on talking to people in portuguese - police, gym, restaurants, hotels, cariocas, street sellers, armed gang members lol  ... it became so cool to travel that I actually feel the best when on the road ... I'm not scared and somehow short term \"friendships\" work better with my brain paranoias.   \n\n\nDon't go home without being high &amp; drunk in rome plz   \n\n\nIF you come back from rome feeling bad ... recover and book your next flight to Prague ...",

You should try to appreciate these feelings of terror and bewilderment because I predict you will spend the rest of your life trying to recapture them.\n\nThis thing about going into a shop to buy something is interesting. It's always the first thing I make myself do whenever I get somewhere and it always feels like a bit of a hurdle, but once I've done that everything starts falling into place.\n\nI think you will make a good solo traveller, once you've got over these nerves. The worst travellers are the ones who don't seem to realise that they are no longer living in their home environment.",

Especially when trying to buy something at a shop, it could be a bit of fun trying to communicate due to the language barrier. Idk if this is good advice, I guess the biggest thing I would recommend is to see if you\u2019re doing what you love instead of doing what you think ppl will love you for. For example, you mentioned all these clubs and activities you joined, while they are a great way to at least meet some people, if they are activities you don\u2019t enjoy, then it may feel hard to engage well. Writing this at 2 am so idk if im even making sense, but basically, it\u2019s easier to create friendships doing something you enjoy at least I think so \ud83d\uddff anyways what Roman Architecture have you seen?

Immerse yourself fully in each minute.  Ask not what the world has to offer you, but what you have to offer the world. Think deep thoughts, read Kerouac, sleep outside, allow yourself to drift without aim, and know that everything that you touch, see, and experience, no matter how mundane, is now a part of you.\nPat yourself on the back for taking the road less traveled. Look out the windows, go to dive bars and listen, sit on park benches and talk to the elderly.

You can be proud of yourself, and you will be at some point down the line, even though I understand it's hard to see any kind silver lining through the shame and sense of failure you're experiencing right now.\n\n\nI too started solo traveling at 18 in 2017, with crippling social anxiety, no friends at home, and with very high expectations on myself and the much advertised oh so super social hostel culture. (I still haven\u2019t experienced that) \n\n\nIt went very much like you're describing your experience. Abysmal. And boy would my parents make it worse by calling everyday to check how much of a blast I was surely having!\n\n\nI am tempted to speculate that you will grow out of this anxiety like I did. I got a job at 19 and with time just organically grew out of mine. Like other commenters have said, it's practice that makes perfect here, there is no one life changing experience / cinematic quick fix that will change 18 years of your brain wiring itself to be the person you are today.\n\n\nIt doesn't work this way for anyone, so don't take it as a personal failing. Try to treat yourself with the patience and kindness that you would extend to another shy and anxious person.\n\n\nSecondly, some trips are gonna suck no matter who you are. Even though I had been pretty confident by the time and had no difficulty making friends in other countries before, I still had a terribly crap time during my solo trip to Poland. I had done my best to attend social events and keep myself busy, just like you, but the stars just weren\u2019t aligning I guess, I got incredibly lonely, anxious and depressed, and locked myself in my hotel room by day 5, absolutely miserable, also too scared to even go to a grocery store, and very ashamed of myself.\n\n\nLet yourself feel sad. Have a cry, order in Pizza, watch a comforting show, go to bed early. That too is fine. You can't force every day to be a good one just because you're in a foreign country and \"planned\" to have a good time.\n\n\nIt's a lesson to be learned, and oh boy is that lesson shitty to sit through, but you'll come out of it all much wiser than you went in.\n\n\nHang in there. Try again tomorrow. My thoughts are with ya!",

I have done it all - solo travel, group travel, volunteering abroad, studying abroad, college, post-college, etc.\n \nIf you are looking for friends/a sense of community, I wouldn't recommend solo travel. It is one of the loneliest things you can do. It's what you do to challenge yourself and solitude. Think about it - you are forcing yourself to be as far away from your nest as possible and remove EVERYTHING and everyone familiar from your life.\n \nAnother thing, you are way too young to be that hard on yourself. I didn't have my \"moment\" until I was 21 - finding friends, myself and my crowd etc.\n \nWhen I was 18, I did just what you are doing. I went for 4 months. Tried making friends at bars/areas, but every relationship was fickle. Some friends I made in hostels were lifelong, but there was no consistency, really. \n \nAlso... people hype up iceland, but I would have told you that that's not the place to solo travel to meet people. \nAlso, man, you need to already be confident in your ability to approach people and be emotionally able to face rejection to have a good time meeting people abroad.\n \nYou are getting EXTREMELY valuable lessons that most people never get, but don't give up on yourself. If you want to have the real \"abroad\" experience, sign up for scholarships or financial aid and do a semester in mainland Europe with a group from your country.\n \nI'm sorry it didn't turn out well, but you are describing my reality at 18 and by the time I graduated I DID figure it out. You are clearly brave enough to take risks, so I'm confident you'll find your crowd. Just be patient and keep exploring options.",

Order a sandwich, just point at the item on the menu and smile. Always ask 'Do you speak English?' You'd be surprised how. many people actually do and that they are eager to practice with you. And, for the time-being - try to stick with primarily English-speaking countries so it's one less hurdle you place in front of yourself.

You can\u2019t keep leaving and uprooting yourself and expect to make connections. And it also sounds like you are waiting for someone to find you. Maybe you can take a look around and be the one to find someone?\n\nThere are many different ways to meet people but its not easy when you\u2019re shy or in the move, and it appears you are both. I made the bulk of my friends years ago when we were all roomates. We were basically stuck w each other, but I had no friends I was new in town, so I kinda invited myself. I admitted I had nothing going on- that was hard- and they at first took me under their wing. Eventually, their friends became my friends and so on- I became part of the group and as we had more experiences together we bonded. At work I was new and I sat beside a boisterous group each day. One of them was out one day and I asked if I could sit w them. Again, vulnerability. That was the start. Now we are all very close.\n\nOther ways I made friends was MeetUp- hikes, wine tasting, travel organized tours, volunteering, at work, and through clubs. Being vulnarable and admitting I am on my own and need people to hang with. And it takes time- maybe attending the same club for a year, or working at one place for some months and then one night you all go out and begin to bond. Takes time.\n\nSolo travel was not a great choice to make lifelong friendships. First of all you\u2019re on the move. In another country. \n\nGo home w a fresh perspective. Maybe workplace culture will be a priority when you look for jobs. Maybe you use a roomate service to find a new living situation. Think about hobbies you\u2019d like to start- perhaps take a course or join a knitting or quilting group for example?\n\nGood luck OP!",

I already lean on the side of being introverted too. I don't make friends traveling because I don't often put myself out there enough. I usually order takeout because I don't want to burden the servers with me not knowing the language. I've been afraid of bugging people and making them uncomfortable. I have always wanted to have those connections, but it never happened.\n\nThat all changed last summer. I went out of country and spent a full summer abroad. My one month turned into two and a revisit a month later. I work remotely, so I still worked and used my evenings and weekends to explore. The first month I used exploring the city and getting to know the area on my own doing the things that interested me as a tourist. \n\nOnce I got familiar with the area, I started going to meetups and I went often. The meetup app is an excellent tool for meeting people doing things you enjoy to do and specifically for meeting other travelers like yourself. I encountered mostly expats from all over the world. I asked everyone for their name and wrote it down on my phone and worked to commit it to memory. What helped was consistency. The more I became a regular at these meetups, the more people started to notice me and remember me. People at these meetups would talk about things they wanted to do and look for others interested. I said I'd join along to every offer. Even things I was on the fence about, I joined in. I met more people and made more friends than I had ever made in my life. \n\nIn three months, I met over 140 people. Out of those 140, I made 15 close friends. This was more close friends than I had back home. One of those 15 was a planner. That individual opened up so many connections for me because they were constantly planning things and leaving the invitations open for anyone to join. I spent most of my time hanging out with that person and became the closest to them. I started getting invited to hangout with other friend groups in which I'd always say yes too. That introduced me to more locals who would have small house parties and get-togethers where I would meet even more people.\n\nSome of those people moved back to their home countries, but now I have open invitations and places to stay or meet up with people in multiple countries. Also, met my current girlfriend on that trip through a meetup too. She indirectly asked me out \ud83d\ude05. We're going on one year now. \n\nThat trip changed my life. I moved closer, so I can visit more often and I do visit often now (at least once a month).\n\nPeople will often say you are the same you in another place, which is true, but for me, I found a group of people who didn't obsess over the things I dislike back in my home because it was a mix of cultures of people from all over the world. The one thing those new expats had at the forefront of their mind was wanting to make connections. We're all in a foreign place together and want to make those connections.\n\nThe things that are important to people can change in different places. Where I grew up, it was politics, which I could not stand hearing about. When I went abroad, sure it was talked about by some, but it wasn't some kind of obsession that made me feel miserable being around those people. A constant battle of us versus them. It was draining.\n\nBefore moving, when I would go back home after this trip I tried the same thing with meetups. I met some people, but they just weren't the kind I had much in common with. I found more people like me abroad and connected better with them than I did with people back home.\n\nYou're 18. You are still young. If you are traveling this early, you got a bigger head start on this than most people. I couldn't afford travel or take the time off for it till I was working full time for over a decade. The thing you should expect to do when you're young is fail. Failing is how you learn. You'll become stronger and more wise from it. My best and most memorable stories are from my failures. You do have to put yourself out there, but things can certainly change when you change your environment. If you aren't finding what you want, you may have to create a path for people to find it. This may mean starting your own meetup groups or finding something you want to do and inviting people to join along.",

I don't know anybody here and I'm solo for the next 2.5 weeks between England, the Isle of Man, and Ireland. \n\nI also had some feelings of apprehension. When I booked and planned the trip, it was so far in advance I didn't really give it much thought. But as it loomed closer I realized I might feel lonely, I might regret it. I'm going to be sleeping in a tent for 10 days on the Isle of Man. but I also might love every second of it. \n\nIt's all part of growing. A lot of growth and character-building can come thru adversity. \n\nOnce you get home to your comfort zone you'll realize \"man that wasn't as intimidating as I thought it would be.\"\n\nEmbrace the language barrier. You'd he surprised at how many people abroad speak enough english to help you out with, especially in bigger cities.Use Google translate. Smile at people and be friendly, it will come back to you ten fold. Eat yourself silly on the local cuisine. Drink. Ask a local where you should go for a meal or a pint.",

I went to another trip after that, i made tons of friends. i guess it depends on contries.. some placese i couldnt make any friends but that was okay. now my main goal of travelimg is not making friends anymore. if you set your goal as making friends it could be hard and miserable. just planning on different things, where to go where to eat what to do like that.",

            "comment": "Solo travel can be scary. \n\nI too, a few years older than you, have never been one to make friends. In college it was hard enough and the idea of making friends whilst travelling -- which seems commonly expressed here -- seems so impossibly difficult I don't even really try. The crushing loneliness of life, of not talking to anyone for weeks despite being surrounded by people daily, is something I was never told. This doesn't just have to happen during travelling, although travelling is a common place for it. \n\nPublic transport though is great! It sounds like you may have never used public transport anywhere, but you really should try it. This might just be me, but the great thing about public transit is the togetherness of it all. Wealthy businessmen in custom suits to young children heading to school all use it. For much of Europe this is how many get around daily. Not to mention getting to see the city easily and for cheaply. Even though they are not social spaces, there is some great feeling of really experiencing a place through public transit for me, a doing-as-the-locals-do notion. \n\nI experienced much what you describe the first time I travelled, and even many trips later I still face some of the same things. You aren't alone or pathetic (or if you are, then I am too!).\n\nOne thing I changed which helped me was doing less planned activities. I'm not a spontaneous person at all, and love to plan everything out, but doing random things or expecting less whilst allowing my mind (and sometimes my physical presence as well!) to get lost really helped me actually enjoy places. Stumbling around the Low Countries I realized how flat everything was and how much the church spires would have been major points of reference, so I took to navigating-by-spire around. In Brussels I took the trams out a ways, hopped off somewhere, and then at each intersection I just walked down whatever street looked more beautiful or interesting. Saw many fascinating shops I wish I would have visited but I was too terrified to enter. Am I disappointed in myself -- absolutely -- but I did what I did for the reasons at the time. Ended up at perhaps the most beautiful park I have ever seen (and I've seen a lot of famous parks!), tucked away, obscure, and filled with Brusselians. Equally, sometimes just sitting somewhere to feel the place and experience it -- not worrying about seeing something per se, but getting to know it. Also, doing something the harder way when the easy way exists. I wanted to see a ruin that was 4 miles from the nearest train station in the middle of the countryside. I could have bought a bus ticket which led there, but I decided to walk it. My backpack was heavy and it threatened to rain, but it was fantastic. Approaching the ancient site like ancient peoples would have for millennia and seeing it set well within its nature was something amazing and overlooked. The site itself was great, but getting there really made it that much better Yes, I spent a day doing this one minor place -- and with a total of 8 miles out-and-back not including walking around the site itself, it was a long walk -- but there was something magical.\n\nIt's interesting you mention the fear of having to find food, I really struggle with that also and it isn't something that ever gets mentioned. It's weird and I can't explain it, but it is an incredibly deep-seated struggle. This is something I'm still not sure about.\n\nI realize none of these things are universal, Considering I struggle with some of the same issues from time-to-time still I'm probably not the best to speak to how to overcome them since I have yet to fully do so myself. But your experiences are not purely unique, they happen, and you are not pathetic.",

I find with high expectations, disappointment will always loom around the corner (not in every case). You came into the solo travel period expecting a dramatic change to your character/confidence, these are things that must be built upon, it is truely a gruelling process. However, the most rewarding process.\n\nFrom doing a fair bit of travel myself. If I was to give you 1 point of advice:\n\nDivert focus to others. A big part of building relationship foundations is showing interest in others. In your post you said you met a few ppl in your time in Iceland, not once did you give any detail about how that impacted you, even if it was only slightly. You just continued on about yourself and the self perceived mistakes you made and challenges you\u2019ve had. When you get the opportunity next to meet someone, actively tell yourself to be interested in the other person during the conversation. Try and understand their angle on life. When you do come across someone suited to your style, the pieces will fall into place nicely if you take this approach.",

            "comment": "You are not alone!! My first solo trip was to South America when I was 21. (I am from the US, and know 5 useless phrases in Spanish.) I didn't even consider that people wouldn't speak English when I left. I learned when I arrived that Spanish is the primary language. Followed by German, and then French.... none of which I am fluent in. I cried more than a few times. I felt very alone in the city. I couldn't communicate with people at the bank to withdraw cash, the people at the hotel were rude (except for the bell man. I still remember that precious soul trying his darndest to communicate with me, and helping me get a taxi, and carrying my bags on the verge of tears), and I had arrived with 0 plan. I did have the courage to go for a 30 minute walk about town though. I had the horrendous experience of having to ask for tampons at the pharmacy because \\~everything\\~ was behind the counter. I panic bought an entire bag of oranges because I was too scared to ask how to shop at the outdoor market. I remember the guy who sold me a box of granola bars was very nice though. He tried to show me how their currency worked because I just handed him a wad of cash and looked at him with a face of absolute confusion because I didn't know how their money worked. I then got a car and drove 2 hours out to a distant location in the middle of the Andes mountains to meet my airbnb host family. To this day, I genuinely believe that little family who live in the middle of the Andes mountains have one glowing soul that can be seen from other space. Meeting them changed my life and changed my perspective on life completely. I would be a very different, less whole person had I not gone through all of that shit, and all those unhelpful people or people I perceived to be mean or to be scary, to get to the moment of meeting them. Did it happen instantly? No. I still spent the majority of my time reading by myself, but I took so many lessons home from them. It's been many years since that trip, and I've done sooooo much solo traveling now and self growth. I got a therapist and talked to my doctor and started taking medicine for anxiety, and  it really did change the game for me. I am still nervous talking to strangers, but it is manageable for me and I have learned so much damn trust in myself from all the solo traveling I did.\n\nTLDR: You're 18, and it is SCARY to be totally on your own!! Please know the overwhelm is completely normal. I feel like I was reading a journal entry of my own when I read your story. Keep your chin up, you will be alright. You've gotten yourself this far, you will get yourself back home. I know it's very scary, but you're learning how to rely on yourself and doing a damn good job for your age! Don't worry too much about making it some insta-worthy trip. This trip is for YOU. You are growing so much, and learning so much about yourself right now!!! And when you do eventually go back to the small town in Oregon, you will feel invincible.\n\nSide note- many years after my first solo, I did a group trip with 2 of my friends to Iceland, and going solo there is not for the faint of heart! I'm proud of you for braving it and THEN going to Italy too!! You're a trooper. First, take a deep breath. Then, take 2 more. And finally, watch. If you need to take public transportation, go before your scheduled time and just watch how it's all working. Familiarize yourself with what the locals are doing before you hop on. It is okay to take a beat and just watch everyone else around you. When you're calm, you will get yourself right where you need to be. Also, don't be afraid to rely heavily on google translate. Type what you want to say and show your phone to the Italian you're trying to talk to. Also, most younger Italians speak a good amount of English. If you need help from someone, ask if they speak English. \"Ciao, parli inglese?\"",

It was nice to hear your story, I think it's really comfort to hear that other people have gone through similar experiences, someone can tell me I'm not alone and I'm so brave and it's going to impact me, but when I hear someone's whole story and see for myself how it truly is similar to my experience, it just means a lot more I guess. Iceland was sooo much easier honestly \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. Pretty much everyone speaks almost perfect English, its not a big island so everything is mapped out almost perfectly in google, and hiking a mountain, while difficult, Is pretty straightforward, cut and dry. The only downside is it's soooo expensive lol. \n\nI was really nervous to try to speak what I knew would be broken italian. I'm kind of a huge perfectionist to a large detriment, and the thought of trying to say parts of sentences improperly, for whatever reason just seemed unachievable. But now I've done it a couple of times. I know I'm fucking it up but I say grazie multiple times after every interaction. It's gotten easier to just try, just give it a little effort, even if it's not perfect. It's still really hard, but its not as hard as it was the last time, and the time before that, and the time before that. And if all else fails, showing the Google translated version of what I am trying to say has received positive results!",

I\u2019m 30 years old and have traveled extensively abroad, both with other people and by myself. My most recent trip was to Paris last year. It\u2019s definitely a difficult experience to walk into a store in a foreign country where the first language is not your own and try to purchase something with the anxiety of \u201cam I doing this right?\u201d From my personal experience, most people are welcoming and kind. It definitely helps to research some basic phrases in the language of the country you are visiting, simple things like \u201cgood morning\u201d \u201cdo you speak English\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d are all it takes. Just showing a little effort goes a long way to making people welcome you and also may help to soothe your anxiety over going into stores because you can ask first if they speak English.\n\nThere is nothing I, or anyone, can say or do to make you magically become a social butterfly. I\u2019m 30 years old with two close friends and that\u2019s about it. I\u2019ve learned to both appreciate being my own company, but also enjoy it. It takes time to learn that and it definitely did not happen overnight. With that being said, I went to Paris for 8 days and still felt moments of loneliness. You can\u2019t completely escape it but you can do things to take your mind off of it. I can\u2019t also say that while I heavily research my trips before I take them, I have yet to make a single friend while doing a solo trip abroad. Unfortunately, it seems like you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure by going into this trip expecting to make a ton of friends when you\u2019re not actually putting yourself out there to do so and when you\u2019ve admitted that you struggle to make new friends. Which btw, is hard for A LOT of people (hence why I have two close friends and that\u2019s it). Nobody can make your trip worthwhile except you and making friends on a trip, while fun, still has no bearing on whether or not the trip was worth it. You need to get out there and explore without putting pressure on yourself to magically become social when you aren\u2019t. This trip won\u2019t get better if that\u2019s all you\u2019re focused on.",

I print out time tables of public transport so that I have the feeling that I have everything under control.\nFor Rome, first of all I guess there are more people speaking English there than in any other part of Italy. Even if they have only rudimentary knowledge, they will still try with hands and feet if necessary. They are used to tourists.\nYou could go to a tourist information and they can explain the public transport to you.\nEating out is also always the hardest part for me. Often on my solo travels I just go to grocery stores and buy my food there. You don't have to talk to anyone and it's interesting to see what food other countries have. But don't miss out on eating out in Rome, it's just so good. Maybe choose a place with other tourists, there might be a chance to interact with them.\nAnd just go outside and explore the city. Go to the Vatican, the Colloseum, while you wait in line there might be possibilities to talk to other people and get recommendations.\nI think meeting locals as a tourist is be almost impossible unless you stay for a long time. Best chance might be in your hostel, there are other people there that might have the same expectations than you.",

No, people would be mildly annoyed, try to help if they can, and move along. If you can be better than that, then people will not care of you do not know how to do everything perfectly, or if you are struggling.

I had a bit of a rough time getting to the next hostel in magliano sabina, it was a long train ride and then what would have been maybe a 10 minute drive an about an hours walk turned out to be about a 3 hour walk uphill in the rain, luckily I had my gear from iceland, but it was rough. Strangely enough though, this easier to me than the uncomfortability of ordering from a restaurant to someone who doesn't speak my language \ud83d\ude05\n\nI made it to the hostel and spent a lot of time in my room, stayed up real late watching YouTube and tiktok off the wifi which I haven't done in quite a long time, probably not the best thing to be doing on this trip, but in a way I guess it was a little refreshing? I stayed up really late and slept and woke up really late as well, so my sleep schedule is a little messed up atm\n\nThe next day I spent another large chunk of time cooped up in the room. This hostel is very large and at the moment very empty, as this town is small and quite a ways away from the main station. After I had spent a good chunk of time doom scrolling I eventually got up, freshened up and went outside. I didn't do this consciously, but I realize now I think I went about a pretty solid method of slowly working up to exploring and adventuring further. I spent a lot of time just walking around the hostel. It's super big, and there was a lot to explore, not only that but is mysteriously very empty, I haven't seen a single person outside of reception.\n\nI eventually found an area that was super spooky, I didn't realize it at the time but it was the library, it was all dark and there was a mannequin that was wearing some kind of ancient attire, almost looked like Chinese War attire, super spooky! I was checking out the dark library and opened a door I thought would be a utility closet or something, but it opened up to what looked like a secret underground passage, SO spooky! I'm hindsight, I think it was an entrance to like some kind of catacombs underneath the church, but it was pretty spooky, but felt very adventurous! It was pretty cool. Super strange that I haven't seen anyone else, almost feel haunted! \n\nAnyways, I took the little step of taking some time to explore the hostel and I think that helped me to build some confidence to explore the town. I ended up taking a stroll around town, looking for a place to eat that was unfortunately closed, but I walked around and got a lay of the land. I felt so nervous when I first was leaving, but after having walked around a bit, I feel like now I could go out and easily traverse the town with confidence. I eventually walked back to the hostel and worked up the courage to ask the receptionist for a recommendation to eat, and how the bus in the area worked, because i don't think it's listed on Google maps. She was super kind, and she even was willing to go out and show me the areas she was talking about, but she was the only person working at the time so instead she drew me up a map and wrote down the busses time tables. She recommended me a pizza place (that I already knew was closed after looking for it on Google maps \ud83d\ude05) but I will definitely go there if it opens up soon, and the information she gave me was super helpful, and I think just talking to her and reaching out to someone for really the first time in italy was good for my confidence. \n\nAfter that I took a walk again with a little more confidence and went back to see if maybe I just missed the entrance, but no the pizza place was definitely closed, however there was a Cafe that was open which I went to buy some food from. Evidently, cafes are not where you go to buy food haha. I fumbled my way through pointing and hand gestures to buy a couple things, it was very cheap, and very low quality, but it was food, and the sandwich was warmed up and it was nice to have accomplished the simple task of buying something which I had been kind of dreading. I took my sandwich and continued to do a long walk around the town just exploring, it was a little nerve wracking, I think this town is safe but I'm not too sure \ud83d\ude02, but I had no problems, I would smile at people who walked by but I didn't yet know any greetings, so I would just smile and nod when people greeted me. It was nice to build confidence just getting out and walking around. There was a Gelato place I wanted to get something from, but I wanted to do it the right way, and with a little more effort. I did a little bit of research into Italian phrases, and learned very basically how to say excuse me, that I don't speak italian, and to ask for a recommendation. Which I nailed the first two, the third didn't come across but I pulled it up on my phone and the people were kind and helped me out a ton. I got like a dark chocolate and a caramel flavor, it was delicious, and very rewarding",

                    "comment": "(2)\nAt this point the sun was starting to set and I was feeling much better, I walked around and just looked at the sunset. The countryside in italy is gorgeous. I went back to the hostel area and just sat on like a sort of balcony lookout area and watched the sunset, and eventually I got really lucky. A local who spoke pretty good English approached me and asked for a cigarette, I didn't have one, but it sparked a conversation between me and him and his friends, and this was really great. We all had a good long talk, and they told me lots of things about the area, and food, grocery stores, all sorts of stuff, it was so nice to have some locals who spoke pretty good English that I could ask a ton of questions and just have a good time with. They asked for my Instagram and whatsapp and we made plans to maybe meet up tomorrow, and to get dinner together on Saturday! Which is really awesome to me, I feel so lucky to have been at the right place at the right time. They actually reccomended to me another place where food was pretty cheap and they gave me a ride there and talked to the owner. We had some laughs in the car, it was really nice, and then they sort of dropped me in the middle of this restaurant as they had dinner reservations somewhere else, but it was actually really good, I don't think I would have gotten to that position without a push, and going in the restaurant, ordering alone and eating alone, fumbling my way through communication with the hosts who were just so so nice, it was a good experience. And I was rewarded with some absolutely delicious warm pizza, OH it was good. Especially after not having eaten much... Communicating and trying to figure out the menu and order food was difficult, but people are nice, and I think they want to understand me just as much as I want to understand them, and sometimes it's hard because I think I am just burdening them by being a nuisance and not perfectly understanding them, but I don't think that's the case. \n\nOne of the guys actually came back and gave me a ride back to the hostel which was super super nice of him, especially since it was only like a 4 minute walk, but I feel so grateful and lucky to have encountered these people. I got back to my room feeling very accomplished. I think it was really rewarding to have found the thought of going out and trying to order food for myself to be extremely difficult, even if maybe it wasn't like objectively difficult, I found it really hard. And then I did it! And I had some help along the way, which a small part of me discounts that achievement, and i think that's something that is a more deep mental issue i struggle with, but even so, I did the thing! I went out and ordered food, and it was great, and I had been so scared to do it, and I did it. I think that has been a big boost of confidence for me, though I might not feel it right this moment, I think the impact will be clear from a macroscopic point of view. I am now probably just going to spend the rest of tonight in the hostel, it's pretty late at this point although my sleep schedule is kinda forked, but looking forward to tomorrow and maybe spending some more time with these locals. I think I would like to be proud of myself, and I am trying my best to do that :). \n\nI know this is probably a lot more than you were asking for haha, but I feel like a lot has happened today that was good for me. And i think that moment of panic and helplessness was fleeting, as is everything else in this world. And I just needed to hold on and let it pass, take the time to be scared, and let myself have a bit of a break, even though I felt guilty about it in the moment, and even still a bit now, it was all hopefully good, and hopefully worth it. \n\n**tl;dr I'm doing a lot better. It was a little rough getting to my hostel (which is mysteriously empty?) But I made it. I took some small steps to get out, and eventually worked up to getting some food from a Cafe and Gelato. I ended up meeting some locals who speak pretty good English, and we've got plans to maybe meet up tomorrow. They showed me a place that served real food lol, and I got out of my comfort zone and ordered pizza, and it was delicious. I think things are looking up for me, and I look forward to finding out how it all unfolds :)**\nAnd hopefully not getting murdered by the creepy mannequin in the library \ud83d\ude2c",

I\u2019m so pleased you\u2019re finding your groove. \n\nFWIW, on each of my solo trips, though I didn\u2019t plan to (because shouldn\u2019t I be having the best time ever?!) I made space for hiding in my room for a bit of doom scrolling or Netflix, just to give myself a break from being On all the time. And like you, I felt a bit guilty spending my time that way\u2026 but I think the break is necessary. And again, like you, I felt better for it. :)\n\nI took a solo trip recently to Seoul, and it was my first time staying in a hostel. I learned that everyone was giving themselves breaks in different ways. Some folks planned a laundry day to just do low-energy activities and recoup. The laundry room was on the roof terrace, so you could sit (or lie in a hammock!) and read while waiting for the machine cycle to end. \n\nProud of you, internet stranger! \ud83c\udfc5",

After you've done that for a couple minutes then focus on what's next.  What's next should be the next smallest immediate thing, not some grand plan or hope for the future.  Maybe's it's just getting food or drink.  Maybe after that you can talk to the guy at the hostel counter about what you can do in the area.  Maybe you'll commit to a guided tour.  Regardless of what you decide, just do the next smallest incremental thing, then pat yourself on the back, then do the next smallest thing.

            "comment": "First: this trip, solo at 18, pivoting to Rome on a whim - it's an absolute baller move, and you get so many XP and cool points just for doing this. I admire so much how you went for it.\n\nBut it's a classic expectations versus reality situation. It will happen a lot as you get older. Like, maybe you get a job at a company in a stylish office with age-comparable coworkers... and for some reason you don't fit in. Or you open a classic book that everyone says is so awesome... and it's boring as shit. Or you meet a hot person and they're into you... but your personalities don't mesh at all.\n\n... Not that those are all real examples from my life or anything.... \ud83e\udd78\n\nI think if you want to cultivate your social skills, maybe start smaller. You've done classes and stuff, which is a great avenue. Keep trying that. Fold in other experiences too. For me, a really transformative experience was going to a concert alone. A friend bailed on me literally at the last second, so I pushed down my nerves with one beer (don't get drunk when you're solo) and chatted and danced with other folks at the show. I didn't become friends with anyone there, but afterwards I was able to say, *I did that shit, and it was fun.* It made me more outgoing, because I tried something new and I didn't die.\n\nYour lasting friendships will come from completely random places. I can trace a web of friendships from a dining hall, to a dorm where I didn't live, to a townhouse, to a new relationship, to a bank (???). You'll meet people through other people, and the ones who are *your* people will eventually reveal themselves. It takes time, and your people may drift in and out through the years. That's how it goes. \n\nThis got long. What I'm saying is: keep trying, be patient, and take baby steps. You're awesome.",

It can be really scary going to new places, and kudos to you for booking a ticket on a whim.\nForget about your, or other peoples preconceived notions of what an 'incredible experience' is meant to look or feel like. \nYou're different from the rest and that is so OK. I was too when I went travelling at that age. I didn't make piles of friends or even a few. It was scary and hard and exhausting but you can be damn sure that if there was ever a situation that would force you to practice communication, as hard as it may be, it is travel.\nSo as I said, forget the experience you think you're meant to have. Focus on the absolute basics. Find a place that serves food that smells good to you. Order, point with your finger to the menu if you have to. Breathe and remember it is OK to look foolish.\nMake buying a tasty dish the one thing you need to do in a day. Even if you have to walk past the shop 10 times to build up the courage. Then just relish in that achievement and enjoy the food.\n\nI promise this is all a matter of practice. You've thrown yourself in the deep end so time to learn to swim. You'll get there.",

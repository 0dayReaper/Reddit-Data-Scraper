    "postText": "I'm in Portugal and I found a place for 3 months where I was suppoed to move in on May 4th. All was set until 2 ago when it got cancelled. I'm already in Portugal for 1 week in an airbnb until I moved into the room which is now cancelled.\n\nHowever now with it being such last minute, I'm finding it exteremly hard finding something for the next month. I'm debating getting a flight and returning back to the US (where im from) because it feels hopeless lol. I'm also looking into spain and france and again finding it super hard finding somehting last minute. I almost just want to give up and purchase a ticket back. I have no idea what to do or where to go\n\nAnyoen been in this situation or advice?",

(on a smaller scale) I recommend like someone else said to just book a place for a night or two since that will be easier to find (compared to longer stays) and you need extra time to find a place you'd like for your long term stay. It can be frustrating but you'll find some combination of changing accommodations halfway or changing locations slightly that will make this work. Don't go home, just yet! Sleep on it for a night or two then you can go home if you're still not liking the situation in a few days.",

A few weeks in one city/country, a few in another?\n\nI'm assuming money is a factor, so sorry if I'm wrong. \n\nOften apartments are surprisingly cheap Monday-Thursday, and with kitchen access you can save money on food. Friday - Sunday go for a cheaper hostel option.\nYes, it means moving once or twice a week, which can suck, but you will probably find a rhythm and get more for your money. You'll also have somewhere a little nicer to stay regularly, hopefully. \n\nI use Booking.com regularly, after a set number of bookings you get into their 'Genius' levels where you can get discounts and stuff too.\n\nIt might be worth checking your local embassy or consulate too, they might not be able to help directly, but I doubt you're the first to run into these problems and they could point you in the right direction?\n\nAlso: see if you can find out when the university year ends locally. Maybe student rentals will free up in a few weeks and you can find somewhere reasonable for a longer period later on.\n\n\nAll the best, don't go home if you can help it. These next few days will become a fun story in the years to come. X",

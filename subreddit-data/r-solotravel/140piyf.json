    "postText": "Hello! I am very excited for my upcoming trip all over Europe from June 13- August 13. My only experience traveling internationally was a short solo trip to Greece, so I would love to get some feedback from experienced solo travelers on my itinerary. \n\nJune 13: Arrive in Nice, France\n\nJune 13-18: Madrid\n\nJune 18-22:  Barcelona (considering switching this to a less touristy destination, perhaps Valencia, would love thoughts on this!)\n\nFor these dates I am also considering going somewhere in Belgium and Germany instead, since it is on the way from Nice to Amsterdam. But I really want to try out my limited Spanish! Would love some thoughts on that. \n\nJune 22-25: Amsterdam/Den Hauge\\*\n\nJune 26-28: Zurich, Switzerland\\*\n\nJune 28- July 4ish: Isola delle Femmine, Sicily\\*\n\nJuly 4ish-July 17: Mainland Italy, I am thinking a few days in Florence, a few days in Orbetello to see a friend, a day in Rome, and somewhere on the Amalfi coast. Also would love suggestions for where to stay and what to see here!\n\nJuly 17-Jul 23: Tunisia\\*\n\nJuly 23- 31: Paris\\*\n\nAugust 1-13: I fly out of Nice, and I want to stay at least a day or two in Monaco with a friend right before my flight, but other than that I am thinking of exploring France, perhaps Marseille. \n\nPlaces marked with \\* are places I already have a place to stay (mostly people generous enough to let me crash on their couch) and are not as felixible. That's also why I'm doing a good amount of crisscrossing the continent. I am also planning on getting a Eurorail pass and trying to do most of my traveling by train. Any recommendations of where to stay (would love to stay at hostels that are easy to make friends at) and things to do are appreciated! Thanks so much :)",

            "comment": "Depending where you're flying from, I would suggest a little more time in Nice to get over jet lag and to have a day at least.  Monaco is a bus trip away and easily done in a day also.  Staying in Monaco is incredibly expensive.\n\nBarcelona comes before Madrid.  It is worth visiting.  This will give you the option to explore further South after Madrid (recommended) or pop across to Portugal on the return leg North.\n\nHaving said this, your trajectory is all over the place. It may be better to fit it into North at the first half, the South in the second.  It seems like a flying start and a slow end.  It may be worth looking int visiting Barcelona/Madrid in the last little bit when you get back to France, and head through France, Luxembourg, Belgium and Lichtenstein on the way to Amsterdam in the first bit.\n\nDon't bother with a Eurail pass.  They have limited options on trains, times of day and types of ticket.  Far better to see what options are available locally and what is best (often buses)  Eurail is not worth the money in my opinion.\n\nI'm presuming a few flights.  Switzerland to Sicilly in a day, for example.\n\nCheck Google maps (directions) to better work out timings.\n\nEnjoy yourself and stay safe.",

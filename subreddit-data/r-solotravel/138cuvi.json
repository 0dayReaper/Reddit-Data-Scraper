    "postText": "I made a [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/132owgh/spontaneous_two_week_trip_to_spain_and_germany/) last weekend about a two week trip to Spain that also included a trip to Cologne because I really just wanted to see Aachen. \n\nPractically everyone set my head straight and said it was a dumb idea. Unfortunately I really didn't want to let go of the idea so I tried to come up with multiple plans that involved me flying to Koln directly from Madrid at the start all of sorts of mental gymanstics.\n\nUnfortunately I couldn't get a good enough itinerary where I was able to really enjoy seeing Spain, visit Koln, watch a game at Real Madrid or Barcelona, and enjoy the AVE high speed trains.\n\nIn the end, I'm sadly going to have to give up on my notion I can also fit in a visit to Germany in this trip.\n\nSo this is what I have right now:\n\n**May 22** - Fly into Madrid in the morning\n\n**May 23-25** - Madrid\n\n* Peurta del Sol, Gran Via, Plaza Mayor, maybe Museo del Prado\n* Real Madrid game (match day 36 could be any day b/w 23-25 and the date is TBD)\n* Day trip to Toledo\n* Tapas bar!\n* Maybe a day trip to Segovia?\n\n**May 26** - Train to Barcelona (arrive by 13:00)\n\n**May 26-28** - Barcelona\n\n* Sagrada Familia (of course)\n* La Rambla, La Boqueria\n* Nerding out on architecture\n* I have two chances to attend a Barcelona game depending on if it's on 27th or 28th.\n\n**May 29** - afternoon train to Valencia (arrive 14:00)\n\n* Not quite sure that I'll do here yet\n\n**May 30**   - train to Seville (arrive 14:00)\n\n**May 31** - Seville\n\n* TBD\n\n**June 1** - train to Granada (arrive by 15:00)\n\n**June 1-2** - Granada\n\n* Alhambra (most of 27th probably)\n* Walking around. Maybe Albayzin if time permits\n\n**June 3** - Train to Madrid (arrive by noon) - the longest train ride so far though I might hangout for a few hrs in Cordoba\n\n**June 4** - Return (early morning)\n\nThis gives me 5 nights in Madrid (though one full day is in Toledo and the last night doesn't count), 3 nights in Barcelona, 2 each in Granada and Seville and just one in Valencia. \n\nDoes this make more sense? I think this one looks more reasonable despite giving up on Cologne. Though if anyone has ideas about how to fit it in, I'm all ears lol.",

So it takes more time to include than other cities, and for most people isn't quite interesting enough to include in a shorter itinerary.\n\nMoving that night into Sevilla would be perfect, but a couple other tweaks to consider:\n\n - Bump Toledo up to an overnight to break up the trip from Barcelona to Sevilla.\n\n - Consider a couple nights in Ronda, the most dramatic hill town in Andalusia.\n\n[Here is what that 14 night loop from Madrid would look like](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=madrid$3$r~ronda$2$r~granada$2$r~sevilla$2~cordoba$0$e~toledo$1~barcelona$3$r~madrid$1$r&amp;trans=Train&amp;nights=14&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;start=5/22/2023&amp;end=6/5/2023&amp;)",

I hadn't heard about Ronda (but I saw it on the siter), so that's an intriguing possibility. \n\nThe only reason I kept Toledo as a day trip was that every trip in and out seemed to make me go back to Madrid Atocha and I like to see different stations if I can. \n\nIt's weird how the AVE network seems to have just one main trunk unlike TGV in France.  \n\nThanks again!\n\nEdit: Ah the dates pose a challenge with me doing Ronda as planned. I want to do Madrid and Barcelona in the first 7 days if I want to catch the games. Unfortunately with me going north from Madrid it does pose a long trip to Seville.",

I only put it there to avoid the direct trip to Granada but perhaps a flight is better. The only annoying thing seems to be that the flights come into Malaga and not directly to Granada. But it's still probably better than wasting a day.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: I misread what you said. Yea BCN to Seville makes way more sense than to Granada haha",

This portion of your trip you will be constantly on the move and no time for relaxing at all. Would suggest hitting pause in Seville for 3 nights before heading out to Granada. Last time I went it was a train and 2 buses. The Albayzin is fascinating- this is where I chose to stay when in Granada. Cordoba can be done as a day trip from Seville if that helps at all?",

    "postText": "I have a round trip ticket to Hanoi from June 5th to June 29th which is about 3 1/2 weeks. \nMy current plan is to hit \nHanoi (3 days)\nHa Long Bay (2 days)\nHa Giang Loop tour (3 days)\nNinh Binh (2-3 days)\nPhong Nha (3 days)\nHue (1-2 days)\nDa Nang (1 day)\nHoi An (3 days) \nFly back to Hanoi for return flight\nThere\u2019s about 5 days left that have yet to be filled. Because of the season, I\u2019m nervous to venture further South. \nI\u2019m considering reducing my time in Vietnam and taking a flight to Malaysia halfway through the trip. It\u2019s my understanding that the weather and beaches are much better there in June and I feel like my itinerary is lacking in great beaches. \nIf I did that, I was thinking I would eliminate the ha Giang loop and everything south of Phong Nha as I really want to see the caves but wasn\u2019t particularly excited about the others. I\u2019m okay with sticking to 2 or 3 cities in Malaysia. Is it a good idea to add Malaysia? Or will it be too rushed? Is there anywhere closer that offers great beaches and sunnier weather in June?",

I actually rode from Hanoi down the entire country to Ho Chi Minh solo (did find myself company about half way down who joined me for the remainder of the journey..) but I am an experienced rider and have been riding dirt bikes and road bikes for the last 25 years. \nI really enjoyed Da Lat which is a bit of a random city in the southern half of the country, I had some of the best food I've ever eaten there in particular a won ton soup that cost me about $2 ( restaurant name is Ti\u1ec7m M\u00ec T\u00e0u Cao). From Da Lat you can also visit a place called elephant waterfalls which were incredible. It's quite off the beaten track and best done by motorbike/scooter but life is about adventure and I recommend doing the Ha Giang Loop on a bike on your own, you will be comfortable after the first few hours and have a guide with you at all times, and it will open up the ability to hit random cities for the remainder of your trip and get on 2 wheels and explore.\nHappy travels friend and enjoy!",

Distances are also quite long in Vietnam so I'd just leave the plan as it is as your 4 remaining days will probably get eaten by buses and trains.\n\nOh also you could take the night train back from Hoi An to Hanoi throigh Da Nang instead of flying\n\nEdit: Easy Rider is actually the type of tour, the biggest actual company is QT motorcycle.",

            "comment": "Quick notes, and feel free to ask questions, but I won't add more until later. First off, I would not add Malaysia. Vietnam has easily a month's worth of sauce, and if you want to add somewhere, you could always take a (Giant Ibis) bus from HCMC to Siem Reap, and explore Angkor Wat. Phnom Penh is also an option, though many don't like it (I enjoyed my time there).\n\nOkay, quick notes: Ha Noi is incredible and could use an extra day (or two). Do NOT cut Ha Giang Loop, seriously. It is the most unforgettable thing you will do all trip. Ninh Binh 2 days, not 3. It's a bit sparse, Ninh Binh, but worth a trip. I would skip Hue entirely, but if you do go, I would 100% recommend not going for the imperial palace or whatever it's called, if you're not deeply into history it's really underwhelming. Da Nang: The city, itself, is a bit boring, but I would spend at least 2 days. It can't be done in a day, and it does have some considerable places worth visiting, including many places 20-30 minutes away (Marble Mountain, Lady Buddha, Ba Na Hills though that's the one I missed since I heard Ba Na is overrated). There are also great restaurants, and if you do go, please make sure I give you the really cool fish market place's name. I will find it later. The rest seems about right, though I didn't visit Phong Nha personally so I won't comment on that. Do NOT skip Ha Giang Loop. I WILL find you if you do.",

I would say, in the traditional way of speaking, there isn't that much to \"see\" in the area, but the walking value is endless. Definitely do a food tour or two. And just make endless stops to enjoy the seemingly hundreds of local delicacies they have.",

If you are reasonably coordinated, as in able to ride a bicycle, rent a motorbike in Phong Nha and ride a 2 day out and back to Khe Sanh along the Laos border.  This is a spectacular ride and has perhaps 1% or 2% as much traffic as the Ha Giang routes.  If you want a shorter ride you can go to Long Son which is about half way to Khe Sanh.  Google \"Vietnam Coracle Section 5: Khe Sanh \u2013 Long Son \u2013 Phong Nha: [230km]\" for more information on this route.  I have ridden several different far north 'Ha Giang Loop' routes and I much prefer this ride.\n\nHanoi is one of the jewels of Asia.  It is such a great city for walking, street food, great coffee shops, museums, friendly people.  Lodging is reasonable for such a nice city.",

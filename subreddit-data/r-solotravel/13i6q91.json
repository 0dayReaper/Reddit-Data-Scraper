I am a delicate flower who sits at a keyboard all day, and it is always weird getting a pair of 10oz chopsticks.

Other way to put it, you have to put the book upside down (or cover facing the opposite way you're used to) to have the binding title facing the 'right' way.\n\nIt makes organizing my Anglo/Franco bookshelf quite annoying. \n\nCurious to know if any other countries bind their books this way?\n\nAnd why? Surely I'm not the only one with books set horizontally on some of my shelves, so isn't it more logical that the book cover is up rather than down? Just curious.",

In the US, a lot of malls are considered sleepy or they have to add more attractions to keep people coming (bowling alleys, movie theaters, etc). It seems like going to the mall here isn't as cool, but I LOVE going to malls, especially overseas.\n\nMy guess is that in some Asian countries, the draws can include AC, as well as a place to be with your friends or boyfriend because a lot of people live in smaller homes and it's more common to live with your parents well into adulthood. Going out to a place like the mall is more appealing than trying to bring your friends over to your small apartment where your parents are in the same room.",

Every time I am offered a joint while traveling internationally, it has tobacco in it 100% of the time which is odd to me because cannabis is meant to be inhaled and held in for a few moments, while tobacco is generally exhaled right away. When I smoke joints with tobacco it gives me a headache since I don\u2019t ever smoke tobacco. It was funny because when I first discovered that cannabis + tobacco joints are standard in Barcelona and most other places in the world, I was completely perplexed. The guy in BCN asked me \u201chow else would you roll it?\u201d and I explained to him that we (obviously) roll weed in a joint by itself; we never mix it with tobacco. He then gave me the same perplexed look on his face, that I had on my face a few moments prior. It was like two cannabis cultures colliding.\nI do however live in Northern California which is the cannabis capitol of the world, so here it\u2019s practically blasphemy to mix weed with tobacco. \ud83d\ude02",

I havent had a rollie the whole time I've been here.\" As people don't seem to smoke like that over there. I found it interesting as he started rolling it with a pamphlet, i figured rolling papers aren't very accessible over here. Then he empties a cigarette and mixes it with the tobacco, this is when I realised somethings up. Maybe it's tobacco mixed with hash? He lights it, passes it to me, I take a puff and thought it tasted a bit strange but just put it down to the ink on the paper. A few seconds later my vision shifted and my mind twisted, im pretty sure it was DMT. I tried to ask him what it was but we didn't speak the same language, and i was tripping nuts, so I couldn't actually confirm what it was. The difference I learnt was the Vietnamese smoke hard core psychedelics to chill the same way many western countries smoke weed.",

In Prizren I heard the most melodic call to prayer I\u2019ve ever heard and I thought it could never be bettered\u2026 I crossed into Albania a few weeks later and stayed in Korce where the Adhan was taken to a whole new level\u2026 incredible.\n\nConversely whilst staying in the Arab quarter of Jerusalem my accommodation backed on to a mosque and it sounded like they\u2019d let the local nutter have a go.",

I remember stepping out of the plane into the heat and smelling all the gasoline. I smell it sometimes in my home country and I always think back to my vacations. The same is in Asia or southern Europe.\n\nTransgender identities. No matter where you're from the statistics are the same with the amount of transgender people however they seem more hidden in different places. I'm from Sweden where people can't transition openly without being shunned so it's rare to see. When I went to Thailand I saw transgender people everywhere. From hairy wide women without medicine with short hair in dresses to literal models. In Europe it gets more rare the more north you go. In countries like Spain it's very common and people don't care. In Sweden many of those trannies I've seen abroad would get attacked and harassed daily meanwhile in these other countries they just exist or even get praised.\n\nI particularly find that part about transgender identities interesting as I'm transgender myself and kind of looking for a new home as Sweden is nothing to live in despite us ranking highest as one of the best places for queer people. Queer but not for transgender people.",

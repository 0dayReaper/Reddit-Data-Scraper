    "postText": "hi everybody\n\nim currently planing to travel to kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan for two weeks and two days starting october 7th up until october 22nd\n\nunfortunately this is the only possible timeframe as i am currently still in school. \ni know its not perfect, but this is the last chance for traveling abroad for me for at least two years - and visting central asia has been a dream of mine for a long time\n\nthe plan is to fly to almaty. after getting to know the city a bit im going to try to cross the border to kyrgyzstan east of issyk kul. \nthe first day or so in kyrgyzstan the plan is to explore karakol and the region issyk kul in general. after that id like to (if possible) do a short trekking tour somewhere south of karakol in the tian shan mountains. back in karakol i will continue my journey west and visit song kul before heading further south to sary-tash where id like to see the pamir mountains (from afar) the plan afterwards is to get to bishkek via osh and after that back to almaty where my flight home departs.\n\nmy primary means of transportation will be marshrutkas. everything else ill try to reach by hitchhiking or getting a taxi. renting a car is not an option for me.\n\nnow before i book the flight or anything id like to ask you guys a couple of questions to clear out any uncertainty.\n\n1. how is kyrgyzstan in october in general? do trekking tour operators even operate during this time of the year? will there be other backpackers?\n2. how would you go on about exploring the remote region of tian shan?\n3. is songk\u00fcl lake as a destination still possible in october?\n4. would you bring a tent?\n5. does anyone have information on the karkara border crossing east of issyk kul? ive heard different stuff about when this border crossing is open. some say up until the end of september, others say october. and is it possible to hitchhike across? (enough cars?)\n6. do sixteen days suffice for a trip of this dimension? if not, how could i shorten it? do you know a better itinerary? what other parts of central asia would you recommend instead?\n\ni know - so many questions. thanks for reading and taking time out of your day. every answer is very much appreciated.\n\nthank you a lot:)",

            "comment": "Kyrgyzstan is very seasonal. I was there in September last year and season was ending, lots of nomads offering stays in yurts are packing up so by the end of the month they are all gone, which means it's very hard/impossible to find this kind of stay. This also impacts multi-day hikes and activities such as horse trekking because yurts are usually your accomodation for the night.\nAdditionally some busses to national parks stop running and you'll have to book a private driver instead which is significantly more expensive.\n\nWeather was sunny but crisp at the end of the month, and after nightfall and especially with a bit of altitude it gets cold fast. Met people who camped in the mountains and said it was really cold, above 25-2800m the tent walls were half-frozen in the morning.",

I'd assume that even a bit higher is starting to get covered in snow. Trying to go hiking in Kyrgyzstan around October seems like a very bad idea to me.",

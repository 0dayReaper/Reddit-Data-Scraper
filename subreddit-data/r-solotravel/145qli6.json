The pharmacist will know exactly what you're looking for.  They're just a couple of dollars. Taking deworming pills is something most ex-pats do here at least once a year.\n\nIf you'd rather know for sure before taking medication, you can also get a stool test for pretty cheap at almost any clinic.",

AFAIK, a lot of people get them, never notice, and they go away on their own after awhile.   Even happens in western countries, just not as frequently.   Just some people react more negatively.    Unless you're having medical problems, it's nothing to worry about.\n\nI don't think the issue is going to be street food specifically; more just general cleanliness.  And, to be honest, I'd worry a lot more about restaurant food.  Especially the restaurants that cater to tourists (anything with dozens of dishes on the menu, including burgers and pizza).  They're making a lot of food, some of it they're not familiar with, and they're usually storing ingredients under non-ideal conditions.   \n\nStreet food is one person making one or two things, every day, often for years.  They're really, really good at it and almost certainly buying everything fresh in the market every day.",

They wrote me a prescription for pseudoephedrine on the spot and gave me the drugs - no doctor visit required! \n\nApparently outside the U.S. pharmacies can do this. Maybe it's the same in ~~Colombia~~ Cambodia? If so, I recommend giving a pharmacy a try. The drugs they gave me cleared me right up, and hardly cost anything.",

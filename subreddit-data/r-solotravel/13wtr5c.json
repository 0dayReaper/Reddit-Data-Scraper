    "postText": "I\u2019m currently in the early planning stages of mapping out an approximate 90 day Europe solo trip either in the Spring (March-May or April-June) or the Fall (September-November or October-December). I have a decent sized budget for this trip and am planning on staying at mid-range accommodations, meaning hotels/inns/B&amp;B, short term rentals or possibly hostels if they offer private rooms with a private bathroom. Basically not 5-star luxury, needs to be clean and safe, and close to local transport (bus, subway, etc.). This will be my first solo trip in my life outside of Canada (my home country) and I\u2019ve never stayed in a hostel in my life. I am bilingual English and French. I\u2019m currently in my late thirties but will most likely hit 40 by the time I go on my trip.\n\nThe purpose of my trip is to reconnect with myself and take some time to process grief. I\u2019ve been caring for a close family member with early onset dementia since 2020, on top of having to balance working full time and raising three school-aged kids during the pandemic. My family member is in the last stage of dementia and has a life expectancy of 1-2 years max. This trip will be a gift to myself for time to heal once she passes and to find myself again. I know I\u2019ll miss my husband and kids while I\u2019m gone, but I need time to myself to heal so I can come home as a better version of myself and recover from caregiver burnout. \n\nI\u2019d like to visit a couple of countries. My mind seems to change on a constant basis, but I think I\u2019m looking at going to Spain, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Italy. I will be travelling mostly by train so I can enjoy the beautiful scenery. I\u2019m thinking a Eurail three month global pass is probably a good investment for my purposes. I may fly to certain locations to save some time, but that would be rare. I will not be renting any cars. I\u2019d like to do a combo of bigger known cities (Barcelona, Paris, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Berlin) and smaller places (Bruges, Normandy and Vimy Ridge, Rotterdam, Legoland in Denmark). For one week, my best friend will be joining me in Italy and we\u2019ll visit Rome, Florence, and Venice. My husband and kids will be joining me for a week doing tourist stuff in Paris and Disney Paris. Other than those two weeks, I have a little over 10 weeks, or about 76 days, to explore Europe and go on a \u201cget lost to find myself\u201d/ \u201ceat, pray, love\u201d type of journey on a tourist visa. \n\nSo\u2026 any recommendations of places to visit? Recommendations of things to see/do/eat that are \u201coff the beaten path\u201d to experience more local culture than being in a tourist trap all the time? Any places to avoid as a solo female traveller? Any places or retreats to visit to help with healing/reconnecting/grief/\u201cspiritual\u201d to check out? Beaches worth visiting that aren\u2019t overcrowded? General tips/things to know? World War 1-2 battlefield tours to recommend France/Belgium that include a Vimy Ridge and Juno beach? Nordic Spas/wellness centres? Would it be better to travel with a bigger backpack or a rolling suitcase? I plan on checking a larger bag on my flight from Canada to Europe so I\u2019ll have more room for packing than a carry-on.\n\nI have a Lonely Planet Europe guide and a Rick Steve\u2019s Europe Through the Back door books that I\u2019ve read and reread on multiple occasions. I\u2019ve done countless google searches and been on TripAdvisor on a daily basis getting ideas but there\u2019s so much info out there it\u2019s overwhelming. I\u2019m not an Insta/TikTok travel influencer follower at all (I don\u2019t even have a TikTok account) and I\u2019m not looking for that type of vacation - I want to enjoy my trip, not collect selfies to boost my social media presence.\n\nAny help and guidance is greatly appreciated.\n\nTIA!",

            "comment": "Seven countries in 10 weeks is of course doable, especially as you picked countries that make sense geographically, but imo you won't have time to go off the beaten path or feel more integrated in the local culture. With 10 days in a country it will be 1 day of travel, a few days to orient yourself / learn a few words / notice some cultural difference while visiting touristic spots, then hit a second probably touristic destination, and then you're leaving to a new place again. Some people like this pace, it's stimulating but from what I get from your post it isn't what you're looking for.\n\nIf you want to soak up the culture I would pick 3-4 of those countries and spend more time in each. Like Spain/France/Italy or Netherlands/Denmark/France/Italy. This way you will have time to get out of the big touristic areas and can spend days checking out smaller neighbourhoods and sitting at caf\u00e9s :)\n\nWhen you're planning the parisian leg of your trip, head over to r/ParisTravelGuide, we'd be happy to review your itinerary and give advice!\n\nAll the best for the next few years and happy travels!",

Also met heavy packers that were weeks into a trip that hadn't even opened on of their suitcases. r/heronebag has great suggestions.\n\nRotterdam was heavily bombed during WW2, so it is a very modern city, with the other places on your itinerary being older I think you may prefer The Hague, Utrecht, Den Bosch or Maastricht. Or maybe instead add Antwerp or Gent in Belgium, both beautiful.\n\nLanguage wise will be easy for you in most places with Italy and Spain likely to be the biggest challenges.\n\nBut mostly I wish you the best, sounds like you have a heavy time coming up.",

Also some background history about a place is always helpful for me in terms of deciding what I want to do. \nJust a word of caution, because you haven't traveled solo for long periods before you might find it a bit stressful. Like you, I used travel as a way to grieve after I spent a year caring for my husband before he died from brain cancer, and the travel can be exhausting and sad when you're by yourself.  I started my travels by doing a group tour to Costa Rica over the first Christmas without my husband and it was wonderful.  I ended up planning a trip to Europe where I was by myself for a bit and with friends for a bit and it was a good mix.  I'm not at all trying to discourage you, just saying that 10 weeks alone when you're already in a sad and emotionally vulnerable state can really feel like a long time. I initially had booked some hostels and I remember hearing a song in the restaurant while I had dinner and I just sat and sobbed at the table and cancelled my hostel and booked a cheap hotel because I couldn't stand the thought of having an emotional meltdown in the middle of a dorm, lol.  I was 36 at the time. Even things like navigating the train system can be overwhelming when you don't speak the language and are tired or confused.  \nAnd just a small note on the Italy portion, if you haven't been before I think doing all 3 of those cities in a week will be very rushed.  There is so much to do in Rome you should try and spend at least 3 to 4 nights there. Also trying to cram too many experiences into 1 or 2 days is exhausting.   I would just do Rome and Florence and save Venice for the next trip, but that's just me.   \nI hope you can be kind to yourself during all of this.  It sucks to go through and I'm sorry you are in this situation.  \nI also think the planning is half the fun, and having something to look forward to is such a great thing in times like this. So happy planning in crappy times, I hope you are able to plan the most perfect trip for yourself.",

Don't put yourself in a position where you feel like you'll never get the opportunity to see X again but you're just so tired and fed up that you can't face it. You'll also need the opportunity to do laundry. Booking an apartment with a washing machine for two nights every 2 or 3 weeks gives you a chance to not only launder your clothes but also get them dry (not everywhere will have dryers).\n\nI know that some women also benefit from having down time at certain points during their cycle.

I had a budget of $3500 total, a hand-written promise for round trip air transport to and from Western Europe (NOT a plane ticket), a 1 month Eurail pass, a 2 week Britrail pass, a backpack, the knowledge from Rick Steves' \"Europe Through the Back Door\" and several ripped-apart-then-stapled-back-together chapters from several guidebooks, and it was the BEST and most memorable trip I've ever taken. It has fueled a 25 year obscession with European travel. \n\nI met family I didn't know existed in a small town in Italy. I sheared sheep with cousins in islands off the coast of Scotland, met tons of like-minded people that came from and were going to amazing places. I slept on trains, in communal bunk beds, and park benches 20 feet from a lion. I climbed mountains in the Swiss Alps, swam in the Mediterranean, chased dolphins on a bicycle along the coast of Scotland, met wonderful people and family - both known and unknown. I still dream of the places I visited. \n\nThis is going to be awesome and you are going to love it.\n\nMy itinerary could have been better, but due to reasons I had to duplicate much of the first half of the trip. \n\nI flew into Madrid, travelled on to Barcelona then the south coast of France to Nice and into Italy. I visited Cinque Terre, Milan, Florence, Rome, Reggio Calabria, and small towns in South Italy. I went to Interlaken in Switzerland, Paris, London, Stonehenge, Wales, Dublin, Cork, Belfast, toured all over Scotland on my own and with family. Spent a week on a lonely island of the northwester coast of Scotland.\n\nLooking back it doesn't seem like I saw enough, but it was an amazing trip.\n\nEnjoy!",

Remember that for three months you'll eventually need to do laundry, so my recommendation is pack less. I have a backpack that is carry on sized, and I can fit 2 weeks worth of clothes and a couple pairs of shoes in it. \n\nGeneral advice - understand the areas you're going to, and seek out experiences based on that. If you want a nordic spa experience, consider going to a nordic country, things like that.",

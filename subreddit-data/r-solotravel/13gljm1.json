    "postText": "Hi all, I am a Singaporean female planning on my first solo trip to Taiwan in June and seeking for some advice regarding my travel itinerary. Will be planning to stay at hostels and travel by public transport.\n\nThe aim of this post is to seek advice on:\n\n1. Whether my itinerary is overly ambitious\n2. How do I get to certain places (marked by # in this post)\n3. Whether the locations planned in a good sequence\n\nWould need all the help I can get. Greatly appreciate it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 1-2: Taipei (2D2N)**\n\nTouching down TPE at noon\n\nVisit Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, Taipei 101 and Night Markets\n\nTravel via local MRT/trains for day trips to Jiufen and Shifen\n\n**Day 3-4: Hualien (2D2N)**\n\nTravel via Taroko Express/Puyuma Limited Express, reach Hualien by noon\n\n1 day spent as downtime and a paragliding activity\n\n1 day spent at Taroko Gorge National Park\n\n**Day 5: Chiayi (1D1N)**\n\n\\#HELP: How do I get to Chiayi from Hualien?\n\nMain purpose of spending a night here is to get onto an early bus the next day to Alishan National Forest Recreation Area\n\n**Day 6-7: Alishan National Forest Recreation Area (2D1N)**\n\nTravel via 7322, reach Alishan by late morning\n\nBoth days spent hiking\n\n\\#HELP: How leave Alishan in the evening to return to Taipei? There is a Kuo-Kuang bus 1835, but it only operates on weekends.\n\n**Day 8: Taipei (1D)**\n\nExplore around and head to airport",

Leaves at midnight &amp; arrives at 7AM (other night options too)\n\nI would take a taxi from Alishan to Yuanlin (or similar) and hop the hourly train back to Taipei.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are some other cool places if you had a month, but you've got it pretty well covered.  Does not seem overly ambitious if you are the active type.  Any sequence is good in tiny Taiwan :)",

Taipei 101 was fun and the National Palace Museum was pretty cool. We had great hot pot and tried stinky tofu. I think my favorite was the buns from the bakeries. Have a great trip!",

            "comment": "The MRT doesn\u2019t go up to Jiufen but there are ample buses that can take you up and down from Taipei main directly. You can also hire a taxi to take you there which is the easiest but also most expensive. Or you can take the local train from Taipei Main Station to Rueifang (\u745e\u82b3) Station, and take a taxi from there to Jiufen. The train and buses are often not quite as punctual as in Singapore so just a heads up. \n\nEnjoy your trip though! Taiwan has a lot of great nature to check out.",

I found Shilin way too big but the stalls/food are same-y. \n\nGoogle Maps is not 100% accurate in terms of bus schedules but it's adequate - just check the digital signage when you get to the bus stop. I have zero Mandarin and was able to navigate transfers and stuff.\n\nLook at Taroko attractions closely and bus timetables if you're taking public transport. Identify places you want to see and reference the bus schedules - the national park is huge and you don't want to waste time waiting at bus stops if you only have one day! Alternatively there are private car services you can hire for 90 USD (8am-4pm) with pickup and dropoff anywhere in downtown Hualien.",

    "postText": "I (40-something American Male) just returned from a 4-day solo adventure in Cappadocia and here's my trip report! \n\nCappadocia has been near the top of my to-do list for a long time, with the balloon ride, visiting the underground cities, hiking amongst the fairy chimneys and a sunset ATV tour being my planned activities. Not everything went according to plan though...\n\n**Lodging**\nI stayed at the Antique Terrace Cave Suites for $65 (all references to costs in this post are converted to US currency) per night. Typically when I travel I prefer social hostels, but on this trip I wanted to be near the small downtown area in Goreme and to experience a \"cave\" hotel. I enjoyed this hotel and the front desk staff were incredibly accommodating and helped me book lots of activities (everything but the balloon ride, which I'd pre-booked through GetYourGuide). \n\n**DAY 1** \n\nBecause my flight wasn't arriving until 9 pm the night before, I'd originally planned my first full day to just get settled, buy a sim card and explore Goreme. Unfortunately, while I was at the airport I looked at the weather forecast and it looked pretty nasty all week, so I texted the balloon company and asked if I could switch my balloon flight to my first day instead of my second day, and they obliged. Then things went south. My flight from Istanbul to Nevsehir was delayed 2 hours and after the shuttle transfer I didn't make it to my hotel until almost midnight, which gave me only a few hours to sleep before my 4:30 am pickup for the balloon. Ugh. After getting picked up, the balloon company drove the full van out to a rally site, but we ended up sitting there for 30 minutes until a guy finally came on board and told us all flights were canceled due to wind. Double Ugh. I went back to the room and slept a few hours before waking up just in time before the hotel's breakfast buffet ended. The day was off to a bad start but breakfast was good and the weather was great, so I took a $2 taxi to the Open Air Museum, which I really enjoyed. I booked a 2-hour sunset ATV ride through 4 different valleys for that evening which was also great and only cost $20.\n\n**Day 2**\n\nI woke up on the second day feeling a little sick. I think it was from the travel and lack of sleep, so I found a little pharmacy in town that sold me some Turkish Ephedrine and that did the trick.\nIt pretty much rained all day, but I had an umbrella and didn't let that slow me down. I explored all around that little town, going up and down back alleys and looking at all the shops. (I'd received a text the night before that the balloon rides were canceled, so at least I didn't have to wake up at 4:30 am). I finally made it to a Sim card store and they tried to sell me a $50 data plan which was outrageous, so hard pass. I tried to activate a roaming plan through my home carrier (Wind/Tre from Italy), but they weren't able to activate my phone, so I just decided to wing it and rely on my hotel and restaurant wi-fi for the trip. In some ways, being freed from my phone was liberating.\n\nDespite the bad weather, I had set up a personal challenge for this day - to visit *both* underground cities of Derinkuyu and Kaymakli in one day. I got some good advice from [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/12frwqt/looking_for_some_advice_for_cappadocia_turkey/) thread, but even though people recommended renting a car or going as part of an organized Green or Red tour, I opted to take the bus from Goreme to Nevsehir and then another bus to Derinkuyu. This cost ~$5 total and the trip time was only about an hour. I was proud of myself because the taxis wanted to charge $50 to take me (I asked several). Derinkuyu was great, and I loved being able to explore it on my own without the restraints of a tour timeline. I took a short taxi to Kaymakli, and the driver agreed to wait for me then take me back to Goreme. He charged me the Turkish Lira equivalent of $20 total for both trips and waiting for me, which I was happy to pay and throw in a nice tip. \n\n**Day 3**\n\nMore bad weather, balloons were canceled again. My hotel had some good suggestions for Turkish spas in town, so I decided to treat myself to a spa day. At spa #1 I was able to get a Turkish Hammam bath, followed by a 60-minute massage and facial mud treatment for only $70. Later that afternoon I went to Spa #2 for a 30-minute foot massage for $20. \n\n**Day 4**\n\nMy final chance at a balloon flight, and it was canceled again due to weather. Luckily, the balloon company let me reschedule after each cancellation, and besides the first day where I got picked up at 4:30 am, they were able to text each night before to let me know about the next day, so at least I was able to get some good sleep on this trip. The weather cleared up early, so I was able to go hiking through several of the famous Cappadocia valleys. I really love that landscape!\n\n**Final Thoughts**\nI didn't get to do the balloon ride, or even sit on my terrace and watch other people fly in balloons. There were just none during my entire stay in Cappadocia. Major bummer, but I did so many other activities I still consider the trip a success. One interesting thing to point out - The current exchange rate is $1USD = 20 Turkish Lira. Just over a year ago $1 only got you 10TL, so prices are incredibly low right now in Turkey. Your US currency literally gets you twice as much, and because of this I was able to get great deals on souvenirs, food and all the activities. I made reservations and ate at the highest rated (on Google Maps) restaurants Goreme had to offer and really splurged on my meals, and felt like I was hardly paying anything for it. \n\nSometimes trips don't always work out perfectly. Last month I had a near-perfect trip to Vienna which I posted about [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/125uv0m/trip_report_4_days_in_vienna_with_side_quest_to/). Next month I'll be visiting Barceleona for the first time, and I already have a loose itinerary planned but I have a deeper appreciation now to make the most of any trip just in case things don't always go according to plan.",

                    "comment": "As someone within tourism industry I will explain the high price of balloons in Capaddocia. Firstly, there are limited balloon flying slots each morning. By slot I mean how many balloon can be in the air simultaneously in that designated fly zone. Even these companies manage to get slot, It is not certain they will fly too, since each days schedule is strictly regulated by the Turkish Civil Aviation Authority. (basically like any other aircraft). So as OP experiences, no green light no flights, and you get these last minute, I remember having guest that waited six days for flights with no luck. This two situation already limits the profitability of balloon companies, so you can think them as airlines with limited number of seats, and high number of customer (10 million people visit Cappadocia) when you mix it this seasonality of tourism industry you have those prices, of course people will try to sell at maximum revenue to ensure they can go on with their operations.  \nSecond reason behind high prices are resellers, imagine websites like trip.com, kiwi.com these are not airlines but they sometimes sell tickets cheaper or higher than airlines itself. Same logic applies here, tour agencies, hotels directly buy balloon slots, and sells them to get their cuts. I mean I am speaking of thousands of slots each year. They pay millions of USD  in advance and they need to make profit out of this. So they sell it to double, trip price.  \n I have personal connections within balloon firms and I get quoted 150 usd, so 100% on top of that to resell around 300 is quite normal. But here is the catch, balloon companies do not sell it cheaper as they know individuals buy it around 300 mark anyway from resellers. So as a regular customer you have no chance reaching this price unless you want to buy hundreds of rides.  \nThirdly, rising inflation and costs. Balloons and all operations that requires to fly them are much more expensive now. Gasoline and everything got more expensive. Lastly, there is a a monopoly, one big balloon firm almost owns 70% of other small firms so they decide on the final call. They have privatized competition rule as this is a leisure activity and not a necessity or means of transport.  \nSadly due to this reason turkish people cannot even ride them any longer. The market knows there will be always a rich buyer. It is not a scam just capitalism in finest form. You can book online safely, since I expect it would more expensive over there or you may not find slots. But if you go to Pamukkale or soganli (near Cappadocia) you can maybe get cheaper prices. But at the end it is once in a lifetime ride and it\u2019s worth it, it is not expensive when you consider even it matches prices in places like Egypt, Giza or South Africa (costs around 250 usd.)",

For anyone looking to visit, I personally went in low season (last November) and really recommend it. The hostel I stayed at were even selling hot air balloon flights for \u20ac140, which is apparently typical for low season. They were telling me they were selling the same flight for almost \u20ac400 in June that year. It\u2019s crazy. The weather was perfect in November too, it was warm during the day (not too hot for hiking) and generally not too touristy.",

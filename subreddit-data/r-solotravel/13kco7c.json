I have been getting from city to city using buses and have my first train journey tomorrow going into Klagenfurt, Austria.\n\nWill they accept a digital ticket on my phone with a QR code on it, I assumed it would be fine but saw somewhere that you might need to print off the ticket on a piece of paper when crossing borders, is this the case?",

I'm likely just going to go to the station in the morning and see what they say as my train is in the afternoon anyways, thank you for the reply anyways",

And my digital ticket is all in German which I don't speak a word of so I translated my ticket into English to try and find what platform or where I need to board my train on and noticed it says \"In Austria we accept your PDF ticket digitally (display on laptop, tablet, smartphone). Cross-border please print this on white paper a4 portrait off\" not sure if this is only for leaving Austria or entering Austria too. \n\nI have plenty of time to sort something out as my train is in the afternoon, but thought it would be worth asking to find out for sure. Station is only a 10 minute walk aswell, so likely will walk up in the morning to see what they say. A learning experience for next time I guess, didn't even consider that I'd need a printed off ticket",

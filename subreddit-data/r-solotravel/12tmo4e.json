    "postText": "It sounds so simple in hindsight... but whether you're new to solo travelling or doing it for the first time, bring along a book or two in your backpack \u2013 it completely transforms the experience.\n\nI've been solo travelling for years and \u2013 not being much of a reader \u2013 always ended up awkwardly staring around or looking at my phone. It's rekindled a long lost love of reading and for me has been the part I didn't know was missing.\n\nThere's no joy like idling away a few hours in a beautiful European square or the cosy corner of a cocktail bar while tuning out the digital world.",

I usually bring my travel journal along to restaurants so I can catch up on writing, because it's the only down time I have, since I like to spend the whole day exploring. \n\nAlso, I can't help but notice that when I do this in larger cities (at least, in the US) I get really, really good service. I wonder if they think I'm a food critic jotting down notes about my experience, haha.",

That was 8 years ago when I was 18/19 and man I was such an emotional starry eyed lad, it\u2019s always a treat to read. I go back to it from time to time.\n\nBut every journal since then I haven\u2019t finished. My most recent two week foray into Vietnam I wrote like 12 out of 18 days worth of stuff until I stopped (mostly because the last week in Hanoi consisted of me getting too drunk at night to write anything every single night) and now I kind of forgot a lot of the minor details which I love writing about.\n\nI think my problem, as is evident with this comment, is that I\u2019m a really \u2018wordy\u2019 person who always writes my journals in prose, like a novel. So it gets super tiring and on that two week trip in Vietnam I went through three pens because I was just writing a lot of stuff and little details that I thought I would appreciate in the future, which I\u2019m sure I will\u2026 but it\u2019s hard.\n\nMight need to change my journaling style, but I\u2019m so glad I completed my first travel journal. So many memories, it truly felt like my coming of age.",

Someone might sit there for 18 hours and watch 2 seasons of a TV show and fully enjoy it. On a plane, I'm probably not looking to read a book that is for learning and self reflection. I'm looking for entertainment and enjoyment. There certainly is an aspect of \"burning time\" and there's nothing wrong with that. I also still am absorbing plenty. With the premise of bringing 3 paperbacks I don't think those are the types of books that need mulling over. They'd be some easy read fiction.",

I am not bringing dense scientific tomes on trips, usually thrillers, romance, or something light and easy to get through. It is for fun, not some deep revelation about myself or the world.\n\nI would probably finish minimum of one book just on the way there and then another couple on the trip depending on the length (i read like 2 books a week usually just in my off time) and then another on the trip back home even if i spent the majority of the time sleeping or fucking around on the entertainment system. Would I read three books in one go? No, but could be a fun challenge for the future!",

Read a book.  \n\nLooking to fill some time between dinner and bedtime and you don't want to be social or staring at a screen?  Read a book.\n\nWake up early and things aren't open yet?  Read a book.\n\nOn a bus/train and want something different from looking at the view?  Read a book.\n\nAt a restaurant alone and you are waiting for your food?  Read a book.\n\nThe last time I solo traveled for a long stretch of time was back in 2004...so it's been a while.  But one thing I loved is that you finish a book, and then go swap it with something in the hostel bookshelf.  So your next book is limited to a pretty small selection.  Because of this, when I traveled I read so many books that I normally would never choose.  And they were always at least acceptable, and often very good.  It really broadened my horizons in reading material.\n\nBut every once in a while it would be frustrating.  I read one book where at the very end the protagonist was running away from a nuclear bomb test that was about to go off.  There was a countdown to the detonation.  At the beginning of each page would be a number in the countdown \"10\", then the rest of the page would be the thoughts going through the guys head during that second as he was running away.  He was thinking about the various events of the book, and having realizations about the mystery he was trying to solve and then the next page would have \"9\" and he would continue with his thought figuring out the mystery.\n\nI got to \"4\" and the rest of the pages of the book were ripped out.  This was 20 years ago, and I still don't know what happened!  Four seconds away from the nuclear bomb blast!  For the past 20 years!",

I actually don't like reading on an e-reader that much I've found, but the main reason was that the public library has an app where you can download ebooks and audiobooks for free, but it won't work on most e-readers. And besides, I really liked to have a larger screen to figure out train times. It may take some discipline (and perhaps airplane mode) to just read. But I've done so and it worked fine (even out in the sun.)\n\nDoesn't beat actual books by a longshot, but books are so heavy. And I'm so attached to most books (and many of them are not cheap either) that I also don't want to leave them. If I come across some disposable paperbacks, yes, probably.",

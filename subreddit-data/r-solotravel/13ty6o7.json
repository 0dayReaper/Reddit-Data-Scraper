    "postText": "Just back from a glorious 9 days in Rome. There's no other place like it and I felt so lucky to be able to go, My three initial aims in this trip were: (a) see my hometown hero Bruce Springsteen amongst my ancestral people (they literally sing along to not just the lyrics but the guitar riffs etc too) as well as (b) sink or swim as I continue to practice my Italian language skills (I've been taking lessons with a tutor for 2 years but there's nothing like just being thrown into the world of the language to sharpen up and get very comfortable conversing) and (c) do hours upon hours of photo walks (I ended up averaging 30k steps a day every day aside from the two sick days).\n\nIn brief, I split the trip up into two halves: the first half I stayed up on Avantino hill (it's very close to the Circo Massimo, so it was an easy spot for the concert) and the second half in a quiet pocket of Trastevere a block or two west of the river south of Ponte Paladino.My Avantino air bnb host gave me some great neighborhood places in nearby Testaccio (another wonderful neighborhood that tourists don't seem to wander into very much), and I found a fantastic and slightly quirky place for espresso also in Testaccio (I'm an espresso fiend).If you haven't been to Avantino, it almost reminded me of the Italian Beacon Hill (for those familiar with Boston).\n\nIt had the feeling of a Tuscan village that just happened to be somehow in the middle of Rome. It's where the famous key hole is that frames St. Peters, as well as the Giardino degli Aranci and Santa Sabina's, which is a gorgeous church from 422 AD. Staying here felt very relaxing and peaceful and even though some tourists did make their way to the keyhole every day, it had a very tranquil vibe, despite the fact that Circo Massimo was 5 minutes north and Testaccio was 5 minutes south.\n\nGiven that my favorite thing to do on vacation is just wander around with my Ricoh GR, I would begin every day in Avantino thusly:Get up, have an espresso at Tram Depot (always at the bar), walk around for a few hours and just see what I can find. Maybe I'd get a quick breakfast bite at the outstanding Casa Manco in the Testaccio market.\n\nThen I'd go to for a big lunch at the wonderful Pecorino (also in Testaccio). This lunch would usually last an hour or two. It's a very cozy restaurant and the waiters are all very nice and so I'd often bring a book along with me or a notebook or I'd transfer pictures from my camera to my phone for editing in between courses. Lunch was often my largest meal of the day and sometimes my only \"meal\" of the day. (In normal life I train for marathons and am in the gym often and I'm super on top of my macros and making sure I get X amount of protein etc...on this trip, this was not the case.)\n\nIf I couldn't get into Pecorino for lunch or didn't end up in that area for lunch time, I'd either go there for dinner when they opened, or another excellent Testaccio spot called Perilli's. (There's also Piato Romano, which had excellent food but not quite the same cozy ambience as Pecorino.) I pretty much mainlined Amatriciana and Carbonara along with involtini, braised oxtail, and as much tiramisu as I could politely hurl into my maw. I like establishing some routines or rituals when I travel, especially when I travel solo, to help give the trip some grounding. It's also nice when you are far from home to be able to walk into a place where people begin to recognize you and accept you into their little circle, even if it is temporary.\n\nFor the second half of the trip in Trastevere...I got COVID! Sort of. The day after the concert, I noticed a heavy feeling in my upper airway/chest, but I figured it must have been all the second hand smoke I inhaled during the concert (from my observations, Romans thoroughly enjoy cigarettes). I wear an oura ring and while my HRV was low, nothing else stood out. That night though I developed a fever and spent the entire next day in bed. I was bummed, but frankly, after 5 nights in a row of being out from 8am to midnight, I needed a rest day anyway, so it wasn't bad timing. (How's that for spin?)\n\nNot sure what my actual temperature was, but my oura ring said I was 4.3 degrees above my nightly average baseline, so I'm guessing my temperature was around 100-101 as my normal temperature on a thermometer seems to be around 96.6. I spent a good chunk of the next day in bed also, just napping (which was fairly pleasant as the cool breeze came in through the window, carrying the sounds of the three churches on Avantino, not to mention the bird calls and the pleasing sounds of people enjoying their meals on the street below). My baseline temp deviation was only +2 degrees the second night and by the end of the day, I felt good enough to have an appetite, but not quite good enough to stand upright, so I ordered some Trapizzino on uber eats (the polpetti/sugo and the melanzane were both glorious) and that revived me. By the next morning I was better!(In the end, I think this was covid because while I only had the fever for the two sick days, I lost most of my sense of smell sometime Thursday afternoon despite feeling fine. So maybe Covid? In the end, I missed out on a trip to Ostia Antica and a food tour, but the trip still felt extremely full of experiences.)\n\nThe rest of my time in Trastevere was great. Just wandering all around those crazy little winding streets, snapping away, always fueled by a caff\u00e8 from the gruff but character-rich Bar San Calisto or the one across from my apartment, which was called \"404 Name Not Found.\" I did eat lunch one day at Da Enzo which was good but not sure it's worth the hype given how much excellent food I had at restaurants with very little fanfare.\n\nDa Enzo ended up being a great experience though because when they asked me how  many and I said, \"da solo,\" they asked if I would share the table if there was another single. I said sure, and ended up being paired up with a fellow endurance athlete, this one from France. Just one of the many fanciful moments that can happen when you travel solo. We also hung out again the next day for most of the morning and afternoon, and this was a sort of theme for my trip: running into people left and right, connecting, and making fast friends.\n\nThis is how I found myself getting invited to a Roman birthday party at the Piazza Testaccio one night for what felt like my 10th \"out past midnight\" night of the trip (again, a far cry from my normal life of \"in bed at 9\").In the end, what I will take away from this trip are a few things:\n\n\\-the magic of learning a second language, and noticing your skills improving with every chat. Just the pleasure of hearing the Italian language and getting to practice it all day, every day (while making many mistakes). If you're going to Rome or Italy in general, I highly recommend you try and get yourself up to A2 in Italian. It's such a pleasurable language to speak and embrace, even if it's just at a beginner's level.\n\n\\-the many conversations I had with shop owners or fellow bar patrons and the high-five I would give myself in my head when they would ask \"if you're American, how come your accent is so good?\" (Again, I'm a B1 speaker on my best day, but the compliment would always make my day given my beginner's nervousness at the start of the trip). A few times, people even just began talking to me, assuming I was Italian. (I am Italian-American, but having a Roman just start talking to you as one of their own meant a lot to the part of me that loves being Italian and feels a strong connection to the country, even from afar.)\n\n\\-The Italian crowd at the Bruce show. Just a blast to sing along with them into the Roman sky, surrounded by ruins.-Mornings in Avantino spent in quiet contemplation in Santa Sabina or St Anselmo. A few times, the respective organists were practicing and I got my own concert.-After my two days sick in bed, when I returned to the Tram Depot and Casa Manco for sustenance, the proprietors both asked me one version or another or \"tutto bene?\" (as if to say, where ya been?). The man at Casa Manco blurted out \"buon tornato!\" when he saw me approach. Very warm-hearted people and they made me feel at home (along with the Pecorino staff, who were very kind to me and likely a little amused, wondering, why is this random American dude here every day eating for 2 hours?)\n\n\\-A basic observation: I appreciated how people across seemingly different walks of life all talk to each other as equals. I saw street sweepers chatting with businessmen in the street in a way that would seem less likely in America. Maybe this is a class thing? Perhaps the gap in salaries is not so large like it is in America, and therefore people feel like one giant middle class together? Related: many younger Italians I spoke to told me how hard it was to live in Rome as a young person, as salaries were not very good, and unless you had 1-2 roommates or parents who could pay your rent, you would most likely have a longer commute coming into the city every day.\n\n\\-The fact that behind every nook and cranny and around every corner, there is something spectacular to see. Whether it's the ruins that stand adjacent to the jewish ghetto in a reminder of the layers upon layers of civilizations that once existed in this city, or just the way the morning light creates a shaft down some medieval cobblestone street, it is a magical place to walk around. By the end of each very long day, my mind was just fried, both from working overtime with trying to speak Italian and from the sheer overstimulation of seeing so much beauty.\n\nAnyway, this was not my first trip to Rome, but it was my first trip in MANY years, and it was precisely the life affirming and humanity affirming trip I needed this year after a rough and precarious start to 2023. Next trip, I will likely fly into Rome, spend 3-ish days there, and then head somewhere to the southern coast. As much as I love Roman food, it would be nice to be inundated with fresh sardines the same way this trip found me OD'ing on carbonara.\n\nTo me, this trip really captured the beauty of solo travel: I had plenty of experiences to enjoy my own company, but in my efforts to engage with the language and culture, I was eager to seek out interactions, and many of those interactions lead to further interactions. Whether it was helping an older Italian woman find the church she was looking for and the ensuing 20 minute conversation in Italian as we navigated, or wandering into a green juice place in Rome and expressing my shock and appreciation at the sight of vegetables to the owner that lead into a conversation about my union's current strike or finding an amazing children's book store while searching for a gift for my nephew and talking to the owner of the shop about books for an hour, just seeking ways to meaningfully engage and having a curiosity about the people and places I encountered really made for an enriching solo travel experience, because as Rolf Potts points out, had I been with a friend on this trip, we would have created our own bubble, and this bubble would have kept others out.\n\nThis being a solo travel sub, I will say that there's always that early part of the trip where you feel alone and disoriented after arriving in a new place after flying all night, like, \"ah maybe I should have broken the trip up, or not made for such a long stay, etc\" but whenever I felt that way in the early day and a half, I would just force myself to engage more fully with the world around me. Remember, the satisfaction of this kind of travel comes in the context of being outside your comfort zone, and the area outside that zone can be a little uncomfortable! But by the end, I didn't want to leave. And that's for me where the real magic of travel is.\n\nAnyway, thank you to Rome and it's people for one of the best times in my 39 years.(If anyone is curious, I'll be posting many photos from this trip at my IG@ rovinglumix.",

If you want to go there, that is the first thing you want to work on reserving timed admission for.  \n\nIf you are a museum person, you might want to look into whether the Vatican Museums offer any days where they are open late, and reserve timed admission on such a day. I think in fall '21, this was Thurs+Fri, but now appears to be Fri+Sat, but Friday is to 1030pm (!!!!!) and Sat is 8. The Museums include the Sistine Chapel, and are fairly enormous - I spent 11ish hours in them on a visit.  \n\nNext, if you want to do the Colosseum first thing so you can spend the rest of the day in the Forum and Palatine Hill, looking into reserving a timed admission for it first thing one morning. Look into the terms and conditions of your ticket - the Colosseum ticket likely has access to both the Forum+ Palatine Hill within 24 hours for the Colosseum admission, so you don't need to do them all in the same day, necessarily.   \n\nThe above are really the \"immovable\" things you want to plan around - the other attractions like the Capitoline Museums, National Roman Museums tended to have &lt; 15 minute lines. I spent 7 weeks in Rome fall '21",

Simple things like \"un tavolo per uno\" or \"dov'\u00e8 (where is) the...(whatever).\" Not necessary but I think people appreciate even small efforts. If you learn a handful of phrases and then the italian word for maybe the most 50 used words in your native tongue, you'll have a nice toolkit. \n\nYou could stay in Monti, which is a very cute area if you can find a nice little quiet street, and be very close to the sites you mentioned.",

Trastevere is hardly an off the beaten path neighborhood, but I stayed in an air bnb in a quieter pocket, and it made it feel like I was just living in a neighborhood vs just another tourist being thrown into the maw of the crowd every day. Avantino is also very special if you can find a place up there. You'll feel a thousand miles away from it all but you'll never be more than 5 minutes from the city.",

As in, almost impossible. When I went indoors (to use a restroom, say), I would put on a well fitting n95 mask. I took every precaution I could. I definitely could have gotten someone sick, you're totally right. And yet, once I became sick, I would have remained contagious for 5-10 days in the likely scenario. Should I have...skipped my flight as well? Extended my trip another week to avoid traveling while potentially contagious? I tried to be very safe, and I think being outdoors and eating outdoors was a responsible thing to do. Was I perfect in this? No. But then again, neither was the person who got me sick. I went to a concert full of people and assumed a risk and paid a price for this when I came down with a fever the next night.\n\nAnd yes, your assumption was that I didn't take any precautions after I became sick. Traveling and being in large groups exposes us to risk. We must mitigate that risk and then make decisions and compromises based on circumstances.\n\nAs for not testing, I didn't test because I assumed I had covid and acted accordingly (masking indoors, staying outside etc). Most of my time was spent outdoors photographing quiet backstreets by myself. Who do you suppose I was infecting in such a scenario?\n\nNow, we've clearly established myself as a Truly Awful Human, so I'm curious what would you have done in a similar situation?",

Though I walked so much that there wasn't a whole lot I felt I didn't get to experience. I had done a lot of the famous sites on my first trip there as a college student, so I didn't feel very compelled to do them again. There were a lot of smaller churches I had heard about so I did visit them when I was near, and really spent a lot of time sitting in and admiring the churches of Aventino, which were not very visited, so I feel I made some of my own connections I would not have made if I was just following what the guidebooks were telling me.",

I'm also amazed at how many quiet places you can find in rome to the point where you're the only person at X location. Parks, small churches, out of the way piazzas.

I took one of my new friends to see it on Friday afternoon around maybe 3 PM and the line took about 5 minutes. A very similar view can be had (no keyhole but...) at the giardino degli aranci just down the street as well.",

    "postText": "I found that in the last few years, I take a lot more pictures during trips. A LOT more. This is partly for social media (guilty), but also for memories. I don't do this often, but I do look back sometimes and I always remember cool little moments from my trip thanks to the pictures.\n\nOn the other hand, I noticed that I feel slightly pulled out of the moment when taking pictures. I'm looking at the moment through a lens / screen instead of being there. Possibly noticing fewer details / sensations around me. I also noticed that I think \"one picture\" but do this several times as I come up to \"better pictures\" on a hike for example.\n\nCurious where / how you found your balance and any tips you have.",

            "comment": "I don't think there's any \"right\" or \"wrong\" when it comes to how many photos you take. It comes down to personal enjoyment and everyone is different. Some people (like myself) really enjoy photography and writing, and I find that the act of taking pictures, blogging, journaling, etc. helps me both experience the moment more fully and remember it later. Other people (like my husband) will maybe take two photos the entire trip and prefer to just be in the moment. \n\nWhen it comes to photography, as long as you aren't being a jerk about it and aren't, y'know, sticking your camera in people's faces without permission, then I think it really comes down to the individual. Personally, my rules for photography are, no flash photos in historic places or of wildlife, no photos of kids, no photos of people without their permission, and no blocking a space or site for your own personal photo shoot to the hindrance of everyone around you. But as long as you're being respectful, I say, you do you.",

Are you posting them on social media the day you take them because you want that popularity rush of likes? do you enjoy photography as an art form at all or is it all quick snapshots that other people don't seem to like looking at IRL - they'd rather listen to your travel stories? do you ever photograph allegedly mundane stuff at home, for artistic reasons, like from your local hikes, cool plants in your neighbors gardens, incredible cloudscapes, architecture? or do you usually only shoot selfies and family photos at home?\n\nPersonally I went to photography school - back in the analog days - so I have a pretty solid grip on what photography means to me, how to take a quick snap vs a careful study... What i have noticed is that i don't take photos in crappy light. what's the point? i want the result to look good. some people don't seem to care about light quality. Another thing I do that I don't see other people doing is take close ups at arms length quickly. I don't squat and take my time zooming in on a flower. I walk up, frame it without even looking, and take some snaps knowing, in my mind's eye, what the camera is seeing. knowing what the focus range is, where my shadows are, if it's bright enough, etc. So i guess I'm saying practice makes perfect - I can document cool things artistically without really taking a break for it. I think most of all what makes my approach different is that sometimes I just don't shoot. I want to be alone on the trail or at the museum or whatever. I want to experience a thing, so I leave the phone in my pocket and just be in the moment.",

I think you need to try not to worry so much about whether you're getting the full experience. It's that anxiety that's messing you up, not the taking pictures.

Unfortunately, the brain isn't very good at remembering it all on its own. If you don't take pictures, chances are you will forget a lot of those experiences completely. But one picture can bring back all the memories, sights, sounds, and smells from that moment.\n\nDon't deprive yourself of being able to relive that experience for the rest of your life, just so that you can enjoy it a little bit more at the moment.",

Videos will eventually have a QR code link for the printed album. \n\nTraveling I do one picture of where I went and what I did. Each location may have a few because of specific locations in the city and different activities but it\u2019s not multiple of the same place or activity. \n\nI\u2019ve seen at least one concert a month since I was 11 so that was a balancing act too. I do no more than 30 seconds of each band I see. \n\nI use my social to remember where I\u2019ve been and what I did, not to document m every detail. It\u2019s just to jog my memory and bring those memories back so I can relive them again. \n\nBecause it\u2019s something I do it\u2019s a little different for me. When I work a show I shoot the entire time so it\u2019s best of both worlds and helps me be able to put the camera down other times. It also helps to set out with the goal of taking pictures. Being solo makes a photo trip much easier. In my early travel days I tried a week tour and was constantly having to say, \u201c I know where we\u2019re going I\u2019ll catch up\u201d. Now it\u2019s just part of my trip. I take my time and if I choose to cary my camera enjoy taking the time to get the perfect angle and lighting. I\u2019ve hiked back to the other side of the city just to get the right lighting for the exact shot I took hours ago. I\u2019ve also spent hours shooting the same details till getting it just right. I\u2019ve also visited the same city and hiked to the same spot along an old railway to photograph the same abandons machinery in different scenery. I see it as part of the trip. As long as I\u2019m happy I don\u2019t care what I do in another city. Shooting makes me happy but not everyone gets the same fulfillment I do from a camera. \n\nTo address the being present part. I only find that to be a problem if I\u2019m with people. For example, at family events I usually teach them a little more and then hand a camera to my little nieces and call for it when I want it. They love it and I\u2019m less likely to have my face hidden behind the camera the entire time but still have it as soon as I need. Solo I\u2019ve never had a problem being in my own world. But there is a difference if among locals where it\u2019s expected you be communicating. It\u2019s a very delicate balance when you get lost in your shot.",

This can in turn enhance the whole experience as you view an object or from several angles looking to capture all of those facets you see. Pretty much the opposite of what you're describing in your second paragraph!\n\nIf you haven't already then consider taking a (free or paid) photography fundamentals course or any such course that can improve your observational skills and sketching is also an option. \n\nI don't claim to be any good at it but I find it can increase my fullfilment from photography while travelling.",

It takes away from the experience and constant \u201creal-time video\u201d of your life as you live that moment. Always stopping to take a static snapshot of the scene. \nAt the moment I try to take one full day where I don\u2019t take pictures, I walk around cities, sit in cafes, watch people, try to absorb the little I can but without taking out my phone. Then the next day it\u2019s sightseeing day and I take a 100 pictures.\n\nEdit: just an addition: there is literally no picture of me..only scenery, so pictures taken a million times before (Taj Mahal, Mount Fuji, Petra, chichen itza..all useless)",

I did something similar to a study abroad, and my school paid for most of it. You may be able to find scholarships. I\u2019d do some research into what programs and scholarships your school has to offer",

Depending on the number, the flexibility, the overlap with classes available abroad and how often they're offered, you might need to be planning your major credits roadmap by the end of your first year.",

Don't wait until your junior or senior year to start exploring your study abroad options. \n\nFind study abroad programs and schools that have \"sister school\" relationships with your college. This is a big deal. \n\nUnfortunately, there can be a lot of paperwork when studying abroad. At least if you stick with programs and schools your college has worked with before, that can cut down on the paperwork. \n\nIf you go outside of your school's existing relationships, the process gets 100x harder, sometimes your credits taken at classes abroad don't get transferred back  to your college, your financial aid will not apply for the abroad school so you have to scramble to find other scholarships, etc.\n\nI agree with the other person who said to look at the requirements for your major and what classes you need. Try to find classes abroad that will count toward your major. Also check the class scheduling at your college for classes in your major.\n\nIn my case, there was one course I absolutely needed for my major that was only offered once a school year. So I had to pick my semester abroad to schedule around it so I didn't miss that course. Although my program had an option to study abroad for a full school year (two semesters), I only took one semester abroad for financial reasons and also to not fall too far behind on my major. Even then, I had 3 writing-intensive courses in my first semester back at my college, which was a crushing workload. \n\nThis may be an obvious thing, but if you do not have a passport, apply for one now. If you already have a passport, check the expiration date. Most countries want you to have at least 6 months remaining on your passport before they'll grant you entry into the country. So like if your passport expires in June, the effective real expiration date is in January. \n\nHope this helps and you get to study abroad. Can be a life-changing experience.\n\nP.S. Some movies to watch.\n\nThe Spanish Apartment (L'Auberge Espagnole) - Great film about a French student who studies abroad in Barcelona, Spain. Became a trilogy of films.\n\nBefore Sunrise - Romance film about two strangers who meet on a train in Europe. Also became a trilogy.\n\nA Map for Saturday - A documentary about a TV producer who quit his job to do an around-the-world trip, and recorded it on video.",

Don't wait until your junior or senior year to start exploring your study abroad options.\n\nI would even consider studying abroad entirely, so one step before that, to not enroll at an American college at all but going arboad immediately. It is a huge step outside the comfort zone though. But for example universities in Germany are basically free (not only for locals but also foreigners). Some degrees are only offered in German though, but I met a lot of people from the US or other countries like Brazil coming to Germany, study German for a few years first and then did a degree in German.",

Once there, I took a lot of overnight buses that were less than 20 eur. Overnight buses saves you accomodation and is generally the cheapest way to get from one place to another. Where I had to stay somewhere, I utilized couchsurfing quite a bit. In terms of food, I told myself I would do one good or signature meal in each city but otherwise just eat whatever cheap food. I'd take public transportation everywhere and try to not pay so much on things that need tickets.",

(I'm not defending them doing this, simply just stating my fear).\n\nAnd what do you write on your resume? Do you state you were travelling for a year?",

I basically just brushed it aside and acted as if it's a non issue. I  simply told him I plan on staying for a while and he doesn't have to worry (which was true), then quickly moved the conversation on passed it. Ended up getting the job and leaving a year later.

And while I say give up, it is not really giving up to me because those things don't give the same joy as travelling. I've got friends who earn more than me yet wonder how I can afford my next trip while they sit across from me with their newly purchased $1000 designer handbag and $200 hair styling\ud83d\ude02.

If you like to travel, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve experienced that on a logistical level, but also keep it in mind more generally. You seem set on your career choice, which is great, but also keep things in mind that don\u2019t fully line up with that (study abroad that\u2019s not fully related, summer opportunities outside your field). I had a friend who took two gap years before law school to live in another country. Don\u2019t hesitate to check out work or volunteer programs abroad if that\u2019s something that interests you. In general, it can feel really easy to just continue doing something because you started it. If you decide to change your major, take a year off before law school or between law school and a job, anything like that\u2026that\u2019s okay! I know that\u2019s more general advice rather than strict financial ideas you might be looking for, but I think it will help with your travel goals.",

Which for me has meant limited socialising/eating out budget each week, no buying clothes or appliances etc, no getting my nails done, cancelling unnecessary subscriptions, pretty much only spending what's absolutely needed (daily commute/car expenses, food, toiletries, etc).\n\nThen third, privilege. I live at home and barely have to pay living expenses. I'm very fortunate and very privileged, especially to have the emotional ease knowing if I'm seriously fucked while overseas I have my parents to fall back on financially, and can pay them back once I'm home and working again. (on this I would also like to add that I'm trading the independence of living out of home to instead spend my money on travels. But again, that's a huge privilege not everyone is offered).\n\nETA: I'm going overseas in a few days and have be saving all uni semester. I'm really proud of myself, but my first two points aren't easy to do and I've honestly found this semester difficult. I initially wanted to travel end of next semester again but instead I think I'll be taking on less work next semester and giving myself more space to spend money on myself and time with hobbies/friends while saving less aggressively and maybe travelling again in another year or two. Whatever you choose, you're making a sacrifice because you can't do everything all at once. In terms of time management, my advice is to write out ALL the things you want to do, inducing studying, work, friends, dating, hobbies, as well as travel. Then prioritise them, from most important to you, to least. From there work out a schedule that works for you. Then for budgeting, again write out everything you need to and want to spend money on, and prioritise it. What can't you live without? What needs to be sacrificed if you want to travel? What if you save less aggressively for longer? What does that let you keep in the priority list? etc",

When I was in early 20's I would deliver pizzas (made decent money after factoring in those tax-free tips), tell them I was going to travel for a couple of months, and simply come back to the job when I returned. Its not always that simple but you can generally almost always find employment again when you return. My experience knowing the roads and routes made me valuable to the company as I saved them a lot of money that would be lost having to train new drivers. They make mistakes and are slower. \n\nThen another huge part of it was simply visiting cheaper (but highly rewarding destinations) ie. thailand, ecuador, vietnam. So I wasnt exactly romping around western europe at that point, or I would go for short periods before connecting to a cheaper country for the longer leg. Now I work as a consultant and can simply call my clients while abroad or do computer work. A lot of jobs are becoming more remote and travel friendly these days. IF you happen to have an interest in working with computer ie. softeware development, you can probably have great freedom in earning a ton of money while being location independent. Its not my field but ive met many travels doing something like that.",

Plus, he only worked 4-5 months a year, and traveled the rest with the money he made. I doubt he had a college degree.\n\nOr, consider college professors or teaching clinicians or IMF specialists or archeologists or any type of research/specialty profession. Aside from teaching/practicing, some do specialty research and travel the world to professional meetings or research sites. Some get a sabbatical (half pay) leave every six years and can travel to whatever university/hospital/NGO/site would host them. That one requires multiple degrees and fancy work, though. It's also lower pay than industry.\n\nOr spouses, who could travel along with a professional family member to remote locations, and get to travel solo on location while their partner attends meetings. That one requires some other degree, perhaps from a charm school? It may also require sacrificing one's professional career.\n\nOr, as others said, digital nomad professions. Or artists and athletes.

Not sure if you're American but if so,  I think spring semester sophomore year is the best time. Start looking into it early, because it's something you will have to decide on and apply for in advance of the semester.\n\nNow, back to your original question. I can afford it because I work for a large airline and I can fly for free as part of the benefits package. I don't make much money but as flights are usually the most expensive part of traveling it makes it super easy.\n\nFor other people I know -- they just make travel a priority with their life and their finances. There's multiple ways to do it, but it really boils down to that. Spending less money on rent, car, etc to save for traveling. Only looking for jobs that are remote. Looking for jobs that allow you to travel. Alternating between working for 6 months/a year, and then quitting to travel for several months. Stuff like that. \n\nWith that being said, I don't know what your field of study is, or what your dream career (if any) might be. BUT, if you don't know what you want to do as a career (because I didn't, and this is what I wish someone told me), then I would advise you to think more about the lifestyle you want (traveling for work? A bunch of money? remote job?), and use that to help you narrow down career options and fields of study you should choose between (re-reading your post now I see you already sorta mentioned that. whoops). \n\n Many study-abroad programs are linked to your major so your options might be limited. Also, I'm a strong believer in doing a study abroad program organized by your university, not through a third party (although certainly still a good option), because that way some of the friends you make will come back home with you to the same college after the semester is over.\n\nOk I got slightly off topic but I think it's all relevant. General advice? Have fun in college.  Say **yes** to things. Say yes to plans. Say yes to opportunities. Keep saying yes, but don't be a dumbass. Time management probably won't be hard, there are just times when you have to prioritize schoolwork. It sucks but you're in school for a reason. Do it. Again, not sure if you're American, but if you are, please make at least a 3.0, preferably higher, to keep your options for graduate school afterwards or in the future more open than they would be if you made shitty grades.\n\nAlso I'm a huge proponent of the post-graduation solo backpacking trip. If you can sneak a summer backpacking trip in there after junior year, or after study abroad, that's sick too. Don't miss too much of college though",

Study hard/get a good job out of school and work hard to establish your career for 2-3 years after school. Ideally during this time you'll be saving money (living at home/cheap apartment).  In this time (3 years for me) I saved up enough money to travel around SE Asia with my partner for 7 months without working and still had some savings at the end of the trip. When I left for this trip I had established my career well enough that I had job leads for when I came back from traveling. \n3. Find a career that allows you to travel/work remote. I do digital marketing (specifically running ads/\"growth\" marketing\"). It's a tangible skill that can be applied to a lot of different companies/industries. If you want the freedom to work remote you need to know your stuff so that you can win the trust of your employers/clients. \n4. After working at a few startups I decided to freelance for a few years. I kept a home base but being my own boss allowed me to travel for 1-2 months at a time to different places that interested me. \n5.

For instance the other week I was looking to book a flight USA to Norway with united miles. One way was 73k miles with a stop in London. Then I looked up USA to London and it was 37k miles and the connecting flight from there to Norway was $100.",

They have a US wage in a country where the average monthly salary is around $500, which lets them have more time to play around the world in 80 days than their US counterparts, even if their counterparts earn significantly more.",

No bars or going out, and if I\u2019m meeting friends for dinner, I\u2019ll often eat something at home and order a snack when I\u2019m with people. Some friends thought I was just being really stingy but now they understand. Every time I make a sacrifice like this, I\u2019ll think \u201cok, I was just about to drop $50-100 at the bar\u201d and I\u2019ll instead put that into savings.\n\nThe other thing I recommend is to find a side hustle and pour all of that money into travel. I\u2019m a photographer and I used to (pre-Covid) have a business on the side selling large landscape prints of my work to interior designers. At its peak, I would bring in $1000-2000 a month, and was more than enough to take a 2ish week long trip every 3 months or so.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a high school teacher living in the US for context. So I don\u2019t make that much money but I make a comfortable living as I don\u2019t have kids and don\u2019t plan on it. I travel pretty much every break (winter, spring, and then a longer trip in summer), and the built in time off is key. So I\u2019m lucky that I don\u2019t have a small number of vacation days to plan around\u2014I collect my paychecks year round and travel when I\u2019m not working. Of course this means I have limited flexibility for timing and end up going to a lot of places during high season, but it\u2019s worth the trade off IMO.\n\nI also travel cheaply. I don\u2019t mind cheap hostels and I do a lot of walking around, free museums, etc. If I could stop going to so many damn bars and restaurants when I\u2019m abroad I could probably travel twice as long lol no need for high priced hotels. Give me a bunk and a backpack and I\u2019m good to go. \n\nPerhaps most importantly, I\u2019m flexible about where I go and I always look for flights. I book random locations far in advance. For example, I knew I wanted to go to Europe this summer so I snagged a flight from JFK to Berlin for $128 6 months ago. A month after that, I grabbed London to JFK for $350. The rest I figured out as I went along (flights within Europe are cheap). In comparison, I\u2019m trying to get a friend to come along for part of the trip, and with his limited travel window and limited destination options (he\u2019s meeting up with me, after all), it will cost him closer to $1200 to get to Europe and back. \n\nIt\u2019s also a matter of priorities. Like I said, I don\u2019t want kids. People definitely have families and still travel, but I can\u2019t imagine I would be able to do so in the way that I find ideal. I also rent and have state pension so I don\u2019t put away a ton of money except for building a nest egg for emergencies. A lot of people might find my lifestyle unappealing, but I value my travel and my independence, so it works for me. \n\nSo yeah, if you want to travel a lot you can do it even on a meager teacher salary. Also take advantage of \u201cfree\u201d or reduced price travel when possible (I went on a teacher trip to China and had to volunteer/work for 2 weeks with an additional 1 week of travel. It cost me $1000 with room and board included). \n\nOne last thing: Get a good travel credit card. I have the Chase Sapphire and it\u2019s a points machine. I amass flight/hotel points about as quickly as I can use them just paying for regular expenses throughout the year. \n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: China trip included lodging AND 3 meals a day! Also IMO, the work/volunteer aspect was one of the best parts. Interacting and living in the community on that level is different than just vacationing, which made me feel more connected and also gave me a purpose/structure and some great opportunities to meet others.",

I set a certain amount off every paycheque aside in it, plus any extra money I ever get (tax refunds, bonuses, gifts, amounts I'm under budget in other stuff) goes to the travel fund. Over the years I've built it up to a healthy amount.\n\n In the early years I travelled much less frequently and on a strict budget. Plus, travel was much cheaper then. These days I'm in my 40s and can comfortably afford to travel more nicely and I have more PTO so I can travel a bit more often. \n\nIf you're just starting college, money will be tight for a while until you graduate and get a full time job. Don't go into debt to travel! Always save up for the trips you want and then take them. Travel isn't a home or a college education; it's not an investment that's worth taking out a loan for.",

Here are my tips -\n\nLike everyone said, live frugally and maintain a savings bucket for travel\n\nConsider trips when the season is not too busy (like popular holiday weekends or \"best times to visit\" months). This is when everyone is travelling and prices are high\n\nUse Google Explore :) this is my favorite hack. If you don't care about the place and/or dates, use the \"Explore\" option in Google Flights to see which flights look appealing \n\nStay in hostels. Hostels are a wonderfully affordable place to stay in and as a solo traveller, you can meet people to hang out with too. Some hostels allow you to stay for free if you do some work around the hostels for a couple of hours a day\n\nSubscribe to travel deals like Scott's flights or TripAdvisor to jump on those deals as they come up\n\nGet a travel credit card and rack up points from every day use to travel for free\n\nGet loyalty accounts with major airlines. While it may be too soon to choose one airline and stick with it, I would still recommend getting points for whatever travel you do end up using their flights for\n\n\"By hook or by crook, I hope you will possess yourselves of money enough to travel and to idle, to contemplate the future or the past of the world, to dream over books and loiter at street corners and let the line of thought dip deep into the stream.\n\nFor I am by no means confining you to fiction. \"\n- Virginia Woolf\n\nEdit: formatting",

I've made okay to good money since the minute I graduated highschool.\n\nSo basically I do what everyone else said - work really hard for 2 years and save money and then travel for 3 to 6 months before going back home to work. \n\nI've had the incredible benefit/luck of bosses who like me at both companies I've worked for over the past 15 years (some of this luck is created by myself due to my hard work/sacrifices for the company during my time home in Canada, but I recognize some people may not be as lenient as my employers). \n\nTLDR: I grind almost to the point of misery. Pros - money for travel, don't have to be a crazy penny pincher to save for extended backpacking trips, leniency with company I work for for extended trips to the point it's in my contract I take unpaid time off every second spring for travel. \n\nCons - long hours, lost weekends, not much work / life balance while home.",

Please make sure you talk to the study abroad office though as there are different kinds of programs and some are going to be much more reasonable then others.\n\nFor example, at UF, there were three kinds of study abroad programs: exchange where you went to a different university and took their classes through the global E3 program (so reciprocal program and you only pay your university what you would've paid for a normal semester), UF sponsored (which is a UF professor and students that you often laid for out of pocket but were guaranteed to count for credits), or 3rd party (where you have to find the program, do all of the paper work and often pay on your own their fees because they are not connected to the university). As I don't know where you are going, it could very well work differently, so please make sure you go to the study abroad office to find out all the options. \n\nIn addition, I personally heard a lot of recommendations about studying abroad at the end of college. I would honestly recommend you go earlier rather than later. Gen-Ed's and lower level classes in any degree will be significantly easier to find at a larger variety of universities than upper level, niche, courses. \n\nAs for how to travel after college, if you want to travel but don't want to do a traveling job (ie where you are constantly moving between cities or away from home for extended periods of time) look into jobs/internships/Co-ops at airlines. They have positions in a wide variety of fields and you can pay almost nothing or significantly less to non-rev to just about anywhere (that has seats available). I have friends who work for delta and with smart planning, have gone to Europe multiple times for wayy less then anything I could purchase myself and almost always get upgraded to business or first class for no additonal charge. If you want international travel options, check out the bigger airlines (delta, united, american). But also airlines that are within alliances (oneworld, etc) as they often allow non-reving on other airlines as well.",

I mean, it isn\u2019t always cheap, but almost every place in the world can be done either cheaply or expensively. Vegas is a great example. For American anyway, you can fly there for cheap, stay for less than 100 dollars a night, and do lots of things for free.

You might have to travel farther into the cities, sacrifice others things, but don\u2019t let money deter you from traveling. You can always travel within your own country, as well.

They worked part time and travelled on that budget alone.\n\nOthers worked longer than they needed, like an extra day or shift every so often to create a budget, or get gigs here and there.\n\nAnother one is working remotely, a friend scored an IT job after interning there, which he could work while traveling. He kept such jobs after graduation and keeps working overseas, which is sometimes called digital nomad. Some pick up jobs teaching English in Asian countries, for example.\n\nBeing frugal helps, but not needed exactly. Studying abroad, student exchanges, volunteering abroad all turns regular stuff you'd do into overseas travels.\n\nPlease don't get into \"begpacking\". \nGood luck.",

            "comment": "Study abroad, it often costs roughly the same as it would have to do the semester at home, especially if you live in an expensive city already. I personally did summer programs which ultimately saved me money because I was able to graduate a semester early.\n\nIt's not that travel isn't expensive but the moment you start thinking of it as a necessity/line item in your budget, you're on the road to being able to \"afford\" it. Rent costs x, transportation costs x, travel costs x. Everyone's budget is different but the key is to make travel a %, even if it means living in a worse apartment or buying a cheaper car or not buying that second pet.\n\nThe other thing I'll say is that a lot of people's only reference for travel's expense is family vacations or. things like bachelorette parties. But group trips are almost always more expensive because of kids needing different things, adults with bad backs, general tendency of groups to spend a little extra for \"luxury.\" But traveling solo is much leaner because you're only paying for one person and you're only paying for things you want to do, so every dollar spent is a dollar toward your enjoyment.\n\nFor example, for a week in a major city for a family of 4, they might spend $2k on the hotel, $1k on the rental car, $1k on food, $400 on a private Jeep tour of \\[attraction\\], $100 on museum tickets for 4, etc. A solo person could spend $500 for a $70/night hostel, $150 on trains/cabs/buses, $200 on food (cheaper because they're not sitting down as much), $75 on the public \\[attraction\\] tour, $25 on 1 museum ticket. That's \\~1k for the same trip that costs a family of four at least 5k. A solo person also has more flexibility because they only have to contend with their own schedule, making it easier to choose the cheaper flight and whatnot.",

            "comment": "I'll throw in what has worked for me but it's very niche. This is probably most useful to someone who lives in the U.S. / is a U.S. citizen. \n\nI have worked seasonally in various U.S. conservation corps for the last 3 years. It is not work that everyone is cut out for, but I find it to be tolerable because I get to work outside. A lot of the work includes hard manual labor like building and maintaining trails in protected natural areas. It also involves camping with your coworkers for weeks at a time. \n\nThe pay isn't huge, but it can be easy to not spend it because food and sleeping arrangements tend to be provided. The pay can really range depending on what you do, if you're a crew lead or crew member, etc. \n\nI was able to fund my recent solo trip to Japan from one job. It was a leader position in a conservation corps disaster relief program. So I was leading crews doing very intense work cleaning up flood affected homes. But I made almost $6,000 over the course of 5 or 6 weeks. \n\nI will clarify that part of the reason I am able to keep nearly all of the paychecks that I get from these jobs is that I live at home with my dad when I'm not working. These jobs tend to last about 2 - 3 months so I have lived here sporadically. \n\nLike I said, it's not for everyone but it can be very convenient for a lifestyle centered on travel. You can work for a season, use that money to travel for a few months, go back and work for a season, rinse and repeat. A lot of folks who work at state/national parks seasonally do it this way. It's nice to avoid the hassle of trying to get time off for travel as well, since the jobs are always temporary.\n\nEdited to add: I know you're talking about going to school, an added benefit is that most of these programs are funded in part by Americorps, which offers education awards that you can use to pay off education expenses and loans. You'll usually get a stipend and then also the education award on top. I'll warn now that it's not as much as it should be, but I suppose better than nothing. For reference, in the 3 seasons that it was included, I made just barely $5,000 in education award.",

You\u2019re underage but once you\u2019re in college and in your professional life, you\u2019ll be amazed to see how much people spend on drinks and how it adds up. All that money you don\u2019t spend on nights out can go towards your travel funds. \n\nOnce you\u2019re traveling, again, use that money for experiences, transpiration, safe lodging. You don\u2019t have to be partying alll the time to have a good time when traveling.",

            "comment": "When spending, I ask myself, would I rather spend this money on travel instead? Often the answer is yes. Obviously when people answer yes to that will be situation dependent. I rarely ever get take out at home - I'd rather save that money for a meal on a trip. I live with a roommate because I'd rather use that 50% of rent towards a week of lodging while traveling. These are just personal examples of mine, obviously people value different things. Still find the money to enjoy life between travels, just keep in mind that if you only have a limited amount of money, spending it one place means you don't get to spend it another place.\n\nAlso, saving some money young for long term too can help. Now that I'm in my late 30s, the amount of money I gain (interest, dividends, capital gains) on money I've saved pretty much covers my travel budget - none comes from salary or even need to dip into my savings anymore.",

            "comment": "Lots of comments here about savings, resource allocation, etc. All of that is 100% valid. \n\nThis comment is about fundamentals and execution. Because you need a scaffolding on which you hang your plans, yes?\n\nI always start here, by defining your terms.\n\n1. A `budget` is your plan.\n2. A `cash flow` is how you execute your plan _over time_.\n3. A `statement` are your actual costs, which you can use to compare the accuracy of your projects of your initial plan (a.k.a. your `budget`).\n\nSo when folks always talk about \"their budget\", the follow up is \"How doe you execute your budget _over time_?\" Because anyone can make a plan. Not everyone can execute their plans.\n\nThe third part is about being humble enough to \"watch their game tape\" so the _next_ plan is more predictive than whatever just ended.\n\n&lt;and&gt;\n\n* Not all budgets are financial. Many are, but not all are. Why? Effectively budgeting (a.k.a. effective _planning_) is about `resource allocation`.\n\n* The key to solo traveling is _understanding the interplay of resource allocation **over a given time period**.\n\n* Your resources are financial, physical, temporal, interpersonal, and geospatial. (It's okay to unpack that...this is a 30,000ft comment and meant to be read and reread.)\n\nUnder stand all of that, and you'll have a foundation to basically travel anywhere. Why? Because understanding ease-of-process for travel is really that of opportunity cost and delayed gratification. The more nuanced your understanding is about resource allocation, the more nuanced you can navigate the waters when your resources are constrained.\n\n. . . . . . . . \n\nThe good analogy is that of the professional chef: You do not need to own a full set of chef knives. If you need to own _one good knife_, and then learn how to use it. Always start with fundamentals. \n\nI think the saying goes: _I do not fear the monk who has practiced 10,000 kicks...I fear the monk who has practiced one kick 10,000 times._\n\nYour largest resource _right now_ is that you do not have any bad habits established yet, so be sure to develop good, sound, scalable ones, which is what you're trying to do. \n\nGood luck!",

    "postText": "On Monday I flew to Stockholm alone and stayed at a hostel near the city centre for two nights. My first day was ok, poor weather which damaged my camera and I arrived mid-afternoon so I didn't have much time to sight-see but I ended at a cool rock bar called Pub Anchor.\n\nOn the second day the weather was brighter so I went off to Kungstr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden then to the Fotografika Museet. I also checked out the Royal Palace Museum and a cool record store called Sound Pollution, the records they have are so cool! Since I'd been wanting to get a new tattoo for a while I found a place near my hostel and got seen to immediately. It's a simple design of a hooded figure on my forearm, dad hated the idea of me getting a tattoo on my arm but it's my body and no longer live at home. Ended the night by going to Pub Anchor again and that was it.\n\nOn Wednesday I got the train to Gothenburg. Truthfully and was honestly mesmerised by the views and some of the houses sat near the lakes. Withoutwanting to sounding cringy, Sweden is a beautiful country. I was a bit nervous I wouldn't like it becuase I had a weird feeling about my hostel (thankfully there was no need to be in the end) and the guy who tattooed me said he's from Gothenburg and there isn't too much touristy stuff to do there. When I got to Gothenburg, I immediately fell in love. It reminded me of Dublin in a way, since the river runs through the middle of the city centre, there are trams everywhere and the pavements look similar. After checking and going for some lunch, I went walking around the city centre for an hour and a half. I then went up the Botaniska Tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden and wandered around for a good fourty-five minutes.\n\nThe following day I went out for lunch then visited the G\u00f6teborgs Stadsmuseum and then checked out a record store and went for a walk in a few areas I hadn't been to before. I ended up wandering aimlessly for a good hour or so before going through Haga and up the steps to Skansen Kronan where I could get a great view of the whole city. Afterwards I spent much of the afternoon walking around, having a few pints and checking out the Museum of Art where I saw some paintings by Picasso and Van Gogh along with plenty of others. I ended that night by having a few drinks at Rockbaren.\n\nI flew back to London and honestly I'm sad to be back. I had such an amazing time in Sweden, the cities and countrysides are so beautiful, and the people there are so warm and friendly. I'm definitely going to come back for a longer stay (4 days wasn't enough) and try to see more of Sweden. I'd be lying if I didn't momentarily consider moving there.\n\nAll in all, Sweden is absolutely fantastic and thank you to everyone there who made it so welcoming!",

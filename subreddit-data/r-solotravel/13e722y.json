    "postText": "I\u2019m travelling to South India end of October for 4 months - starting in Goa and ending in Kerala. I\u2019ll also be passing through Karnataka and Western Tamil Nadu.\n\nI have an outline itinerary - as I love a plan, but I wanted to see if anyone on here has any travel highlights in these states that shouldn\u2019t be missed? There\u2019s so many options and so many amazing things to see it\u2019s hard to narrow it down, even though I have plenty of time for exploration. \n\nI\u2019m a 35 year old female and I will be solo travelling - my budget is \u00a35,000 ($6,300) for this leg of the trip. I love hiking, scuba diving, walking around towns and cities, adventure activities and more. \n\nTop line plans:\n\nIn Goa, I\u2019m doing a three-week yoga retreat in Agonda.\nIn Karnataka, I\u2019m spending time in Hampi and Gokarna as well as the cities of Mysore and Bangalore. I\u2019m also flying to the Andaman Islands for scuba diving.\nIn Kerala, I\u2019m spending my birthday on a houseboat and visiting lots of Hill Stations and beaches (Varkala/Kovalam).\nIn Tamil Nadu, it\u2019s mainly Hill Stations on the Western side of the state. \n\nSafety is a key thing - but I\u2019ve heard south India is much better and easier to travel as a female. I\u2019m well travelled so I\u2019ll hopefully not have too many issues. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.\n\nEDIT: thanks for all your feedback - it\u2019s been super helpful to update and amend my itinerary where needed.",

            "comment": "Just coming back from 2.5 months in India so I might have some good tips. Your Itinerary looks great. Someone people love Hampi and Mysore, but I spent 4 nights in each and it was a bit too much for my liking. I\u2019m temples out though, so that could have added to it.\n\n In terms of funds, your best bet to preserve your money and make it last is to be as local as you can. This means eating local and local transportation. I am not sure your ethnicity, but I am going to assume you\u2019re not south Asian. Be prepared to pay a fair amount extra for the \u201ccolonizer tax\u201d for a lot of thing. You will get hassled and being a female might make it more difficult, so keep your guard up. In terms of traveling around, get a local # and get an IRCTC account. Doing this will let you book trains and busses in advance, which is a necessity in the south. I found trains booked up much sooner than it was in the north. Lastly, not sure where you\u2019re staying, but if you\u2019re expecting to see a load of westerners, that will be fairly rare. Maybe in goa, but overall if you\u2019re in hostels, it\u2019s predominantly Indians from neighbouring states who are vacationing or are working in the city.",

From what I\u2019ve seen and read I wasn\u2019t expecting many westerners for most of the trip and that isn\u2019t a problem at all. My travel goal for India and the other countries I\u2019m visiting in South Asia is just to a) be outside as much as possible doing all the activities I love, b) have freedom of travel and not worry about work. It\u2019s my first ever long-term travel so it\u2019s super exciting for me. Im also spending 2 months in Nepal (inc. 2 x long treks)",

It\u2019s quite common here to reach out to the hostel and say \u201clook this is when I\u2019m coming and this is the price on hostelworld in rupees. How much is it with you to book direct taxes included?\u201d\n\nDoing so will always get you a better price because those sites take money from the hostels/hotels. They\u2019ll basically give you a deal most of the time where taxes are included in one flat fee, which is often times cheaper. Booking with booking or hostelworld and you\u2019ll still need to pay the GST at the accommodation.\n\nCities are so vast that rickshaw drivers won\u2019t know where to go when you get there. Your best bet is to take Uber when available. It\u2019s often times much cheaper. If you take Uber car then you can pay by credit card and not have issues. If you take Uber rickshaw, pay by cash because they often times will try and rip you off and demand more money. I learnt my lesson in Chennai that way. If Uber isn\u2019t available, make sure you have your maps out while you\u2019re in the rickshaw so you can guide if need be. \n\nFor tourist things, since you are Caucasian, you will be paying about 10-15x the price of a local. As an example, to see the temple ruins in Hampi, you\u2019d pay 600 rupees while locals would pay 25-60. You can\u2019t avoid this, it\u2019s like this across india. There are so many blogs online that you can find what to do. A bit specific, but make your way to Ooty and ride the toy train. Research on it, it\u2019s quite cool, and the views are stunning. Much more beautiful than the kandy train in Sri Lanka. You\u2019ll need to book this months in advance so if you know someone  there, they can do this for you. \n\nIn terms of speaking English, as other commenters said, English is spoken so you will be fine. If you have any questions, feel free to .",

But then again, I\u2019m not a budget backpacker - if I was I would 100% to the legwork to directly contact accommodation for cheaper prices. Thanks so much",

Hampi, Gokarna,Mysore and the hill stations in Tamilnadu and Kerela are welcoming towards foreigners and can understand English well,so you won't have a problem with that. But there will always be people who try to scam you anywhere,so be cautious. I have been to all the places you have mentioned in your itinerary,so if you have any doubts,feel free to text.\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\nFor hostel/hotel bookings use Booking/goibibo app\n\nFor Transportation : bus bookings use RedBus app\n                                    trains use the ixigo app\n\nFor food ordering: Zomato and Swiggy",

Getting a SIM card once you are there is hell so consider getting a e-sim from wherever you are going from. \n\nI had a huge issue with booking cabs on their local apps as I used my credo card as payment option. No one would pick me up or would cancel once nearer. I\u2019ve waited for like an hour and was almost in tears as I was so exhausted, alone, hungry and desperate to get back and yet a bit afraid to take the autos from the street. One driver told me that when it\u2019s credit card payment, drivers avoid accepting as they prefer to have immediate cash payment since they are daily wage workers. Don\u2019t make the same mistake as me and always choose and pay in cash. Understanding your accent might be a challenge so do bring along printed maps of where you want to go. \n\nI\u2019ve had extreme food poisoning each time I visited India even though I\u2019m very careful. Do bring along OTC diarrhoea medicine if possible. \n\nI\u2019ve not been to all the places in your list except for Kerala but know a trusted guide there who did my house boat booking and was our driver all along.

            "comment": "I\u2019m a second gen Indian-American and I personally like south India more than north India because of safety. I\u2019ve been hearing so many reports on how women don\u2019t feel safe in Delhi. Meanwhile, Kerala is the only state / region that has more females than males and also has a negative population growth. I would definitely be cautious of my safety and not go out drinking at night. Be aware that you\u2019re traveling monsoon season so majority of days will have intense rain storms. \n\nGoa is an amazing place with fantastic beaches and beach resorts. Hotels and resorts will be very cheap because it\u2019s monsoon season. Be aware of the weather and stay in populated areas like Panajo that are well lit. These are an abundance of shops to shelter yourself during any crazy rain storms. I stayed in a relatively remote hotel in Goa and I didn\u2019t like it since the surrounding areas got very dark at night. I also needed a taxi to get to wherever I was going. It was a 5-star hotel that costed $100 a night.\n\nChennai in Tamil Nadu is a fantastic city with lots of history. It can get very crowded being a major city in India, but it\u2019s also a tourist friendly city. Significantly more safe than Delhi. I would however spend a little more money staying in a nicer area. I don\u2019t like to say this but in the cities, it\u2019s better spending $100 a night on a 5-star hotel in a nice area than $20 a night on a 3-star hotel in a sketchy area.",

            "comment": "In terms of the places you're visiting, Gokarna is a bit of an overkill considering you're already spending so much time in Agonda. This is not to say that Gokarna is a bad place, but its essentially the same stretch of coast as Agonda with a few interesting temples thrown in (and you'll find enough and more of these elsewhere in the South).\n\nIn Agonda, just exercise common sense and stay away from drug peddlers. Goa unfortunately has a reputation and while things have improved, they haven't been cleaned up yet. Also, as inviting as having a drink is, exercise the same caution you would anywhere else - keep an eye on your drink, and stay away from strange men wanting to get too comfortable.\n\nHampi is fantastic, but it can get deathly hot in the sun. Also, watch out for the drug peddlers, especially if you plan to stay in the Hippie Island area. On the way from Goa to Hampi, you can also have a look at Badami, Aihole, and Pattadakal, all little-visited but fantastic heritage sites.\n\nBangalore is a modern city with few tourist spots other than some temples and gardens, but it'll give you a nice break and access to creature comforts. Mysore doesn't have much beyond the palace, but you could check out the interesting fort town of Srirangapatnam nearby, or use Mysore as a launching pad for trips to Kabini (a wildlife reserve) and further up to the hill stations of Tamil Nadu (Ooty and Coonoor are an easy drive, with Coonoor being the quieter and quainter of the two. If you're considering Kodaikanal as well, do know that it's very lovely too, but not wildly different from Ooty/Coonoor).\n\nElsewhere in Karnataka, you'll find beautiful hills - Agumbe is a hotspot for rare snakes, Jog Falls is beautiful in the rainy season, and Coorg is awash with lovely farmstays. There's also some beautiful temples at Halebid and Belur, a major Jain pilgrimage site at Shravanabelagola, and a long string of mostly untouched beaches on the coast between Gokarna and Mangalore.\n\nSome houseboats in Kerala can get a bit scruffy, so be sure to do your quality check before paying up. Varkala and Kovalam are both lovely. Also see if you can spend some time in Fort Cochin, which has a lovely old town vibe (though you'd have to visit in 2025 to see the next Biennale). You can also sign up for surfing classes here. The hills of Munnar are a nice detour too, considerably more lush than what you'll find in Tamil Nadu.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu, the big temples are spectacular if a little overwhelming. A nice idea is to base yourself at a village in the Chettinad area (famous for old mansions and fiery cuisine), and take day trips out to the beautiful temples at Thanjavur, Trichy (Srirangam) and Madurai. Before flying to the Andamans (from Chennai, I presume?) you could consider a stop at Pondicherry, as well as a look at the monuments of Mahabalipuram. Chennai itself is a big city with lots of interesting food, shopping, and heritage that is often overlooked.\n\nAndamans are a largely safe area but allow sufficient time for the erratic ferry schedules. Havelock is the tourist island with the best infrastructure, but if you have the time and appetite, a trip up to the far north (near Diglipur) is a real last-frontier experience, as is a sail to Little Andaman.\n\nIn terms of mainland travel, public transport (trains and buses) are safe, but be aware of your belongings and don't be afraid to raise an alarm should you feel someone is acting sus with you - most locals will come to your aid. Flights are ofcourse convenient, but you aren't really making very long hops on this itinerary anyway.\n\nIn other safety advice, other than the regular breed of common sense, dress modestly, even on the beach. This is not to say that you won't see bikinis being worn (it's now popular enough among well heeled Indians too), but it'll attract needless attention.\n\nFinally, do know that each destination you're planning to visit has a different local language. English will serve you reasonably well in most places, and especially well in the big cities. But if you want to catch up on local phrases, refer to Kannada (for Karnataka), Malayalam (for Kerala), and Tamil (for Tamil Nadu), in addition to Hindi (for trains, airports, Goa, the Andamans, and to an extent, Bangalore).",

The film makers revised the figure to 3 from 30k (imagine) but the lie got spread all over the north India hindutva states.\n\nYou can check the stats and can find Kerala is the safest and a truly secular state, unfortunately that is not going well with the religion based govt at Centre.",

            "comment": "Some people have recommended Pondicherry, but I would say skip it. Part of the city has some \"European charm\", but you are coming from Europe yourself, so I don't think you will care too much for it. Plus, the beaches there are absolute garbage compared to the ones you will see in Andaman and on the country's west coast.\n\nSince you are going to be in western Tamil Nadu, as well as in Kerala, see if you can spend some time in/around Wayanad in Kerala. There is an easy but beautiful hike to Chembra peak, and another to Edakkal caves which have carvings dating back at least 5,000 years. Plus, the area is generally hilly, which seems to fit in with your hill station plans.\n\nI would have said 5 days can be a bit much in Hampi, but you already said you are probably breaking it up with a trip to Badami etc. Also check out Daroji bear sanctuary if you are into that sort of stuff. I haven't been myself, but I hear it is pretty decent. And unlike somewhere like Kabini (which is crazy expensive to stay in, and given the time of year you will be going, probably not worth the money), it is really cheap too.\n\nIf you want to do a safari, there are cheaper options than Kabini which, again, given the time of the year, would be almost just as good. I would suggest doing it in Karnataka anyway, where the state government runs a company called Jungle Lodges &amp; Resorts. Book a night in any of their locations and they book you on two safaris as part of the package. These safaris are longer in duration and shorter on bureaucracy at the entrance than what you would get otherwise.\n\nIf you like/want to learn surfing, go down the coast from Gokarna to a place called Mulki. Even otherwise, there are a bunch of places just a bit south of Gokarna (which is already, in my opinion, way better than Goa because it is a lot less crowded, especially in the winter months) with great beaches, very swimming-friendly waters and not crowded.\n\nNot sure which island you are doing the scuba diving on Andaman, but make sure you visit both Havelock and Neil. Make a day trip from Port Blair to Ross Island and I would recommend you stay for the light and sound show if you can. The light and sound show at the Cellular Jail in Port Blair, on the other hand, can be given a miss. Actually, you might learn some things about British history that they don't teach you in school in the UK, so maybe you should watch that too! Haha\n\nNight buses are a really good option to get around, since they tend to not get filled up as fast as the trains. Plus, you can choose the sleeping ones, so you aren't sitting up all night. Just make sure to get the single seats instead of the double-shared ones.\n\nYou seem to be reasonably well-travelled, so I won't give you safety tips. But I will say that be prepared to be asked for photographs, which can get annoying or weird or creepy pretty soon.\n\nI have travelled a lot around most of these places, so if you have any specific questions, feel free to ask.",

I\u2019ll make a note about looking at options below Gokarna as I will be there for Christmas and NY so plenty of time to learn over 9 days. \n\nI\u2019m scuba diving in Havelock - so could keep a few days either side for exploring the other islands like Neil.

So travelling like a local will mean a lot of planning ahead. \n\nFrom your plan, i can tell most places other than Andaman islands are 8-10 hrs away from each other. I haven\u2019t seen many foreigners using state bus services, but there are very good public transport \u201cRTC\u201d buses in south india, especially in Karnataka and Tamil nadu. I will suggest using Karnataka RTC services where you can, which is faster and easier to book than trains. Getting an indian SIM will definitely help. \n\nHope this helps.",

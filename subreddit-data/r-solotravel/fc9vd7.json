    "postText": "I made [this thread the other day](https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/faq75c/what_are_your_own_little_travel_hacks_or_things/)\n\nMany of this is obvious to people who have had a couple of trips and is stuff you tend to learn along the way. Still, as someone experienced there was some stuff I hadn't done or considered. \n\nI probably should have credited them so I'll go through and do that later. I didn't include them all if they were *really* obvious, niche, or wordy, so the above thread is still worth a read too.\n\n* Do a free walking tour when arriving. They're normally free but a tip is expected and appreciated.\n\n* Make sure you have backup debit/credit cards and you store them in different areas (one in your wallet, one in your backpack). Revolut + Monzo are free, app based &amp; often recommended.\n\n* Consider having two wallets/purses. One for storing your money or cards that you keep safe locked up in your accommodation, another that is your 'going out' wallet/purse. This is really good for not going over budget too!\n\n*  If you're an American, sign up with Charles Schwab to get their online checking account which has a debit card that will reimburse you for any ATM fee charged for a withdrawal anywhere in the world.\n\n* Bring a pen or two for your forms you may need for immigration. Fill them out on the plane.\n \n* After arriving, get a coffee in the airport to compose yourself, figure out how you're getting into the city, and have a little mental rest after the battle of getting of the plane &amp; immigration. \n\n* Bring an extension cord! Sometimes you only get one plug in hostels &amp; its not guaranteed your bed will have its own.\n\n* Write a travel blog or journal, even if no one else reads it. You will have a thought-out history of your journey.\n\n* Research what is the best value/coverage sim card to get.\n\n* Have copies of your passport, visa, and insurance.\n\n* If you have a long layover or will be at the airport for a significant period of time, check out SleepingInAirports. They'll give you information on hacks/facilities. Likewise, many YouTubers do reviews.\n\n* I tend to colorize everything I bring for travel. It\u2019s much easier to spot a colored backpack/luggage/phone/power bank/wallet/kindle etc... than to have everything black.\n\n* Wikivoyage/Wikitravel is perfect for an overview of a country from a travel perspective. Wikivoyage has its own app.\n\n* Atlas Obscura is good for for cool and unusual things to do in cities.\n\n* Most of us are on a budget, but do try to eat at least one fancy meal at a nice restaurant. You'll remember it.\n\n* If looking to meet other backpackers - HostelWorld has a 'atmosphere' indicator. 8.8+ tends to imply it will be very social. HostelWorld is where many backpackers will decide where to stay, but book elsewhere.\n\n* How you arrive at a hostel sets the tone for how people will interact with you. If you arrive looking glum &amp; don't say hello to your dorm mates if they're there (the best time/the time it isn't awkward!) people *will* notice. Be outgoing and say hello. Try to get to know them at least a little bit so you can suss out troublemakers or sketchy people.\n\n* If you **don't** want to be social (and the introverts among us often need a break), look for a hostel that performs poorly on the \"atmosphere\" indicator on HostelWorld but has high scores on the other indicators instead.\n\n* Try to be flexible and say yes to opportunities. Take yourself out of your comfort zone. Met someone and they ask if you'd like to travel on-wards with them for a while? Do it! You could be making a friend for life. \n\n* The Couchsurfing app has a good 'meetup' feature for meeting other travelers in the area. \n\n* Tinder and Grindr can be used surprisingly well for meeting locals in a platonic way. Just make it clear that is your intention and take usual precautions.\n\n* Hostelgeeks.com shows their best hostels in each major city under 3 categories: best couple hostel, best solo hostel, and best group hostel. \n\n* In Asia, hostels and hotels are often a few $ cheaper on Agoda compared to Booking.com or HostelWorld.\n\n* They're rarer than people assume, but do a bedbug check before using it. Lift the mattress away from the wall and look behind.\n\n* Call people out on their bullshit if they are disturbing your sleep by being blatantly being rude - sometimes people need to be told.\n\n* We're not 10 anymore. Get the bottom bunk where possible. You'll soon find out that climbing up awkward ladders at 3am in the morning when you need a pee or anytime you want to access your locker is a bit annoying.\n\n* If you're on a long trip staying in hostels, occasionally get a hotel room for the night to recharge both in terms of sleep, but enjoying a bit of privacy.\n\n* If you have a long flight, consider booking a hotel for your first night or two in the country to recover. Do you really want the threat of a loud snorer &amp; dorm noise whilst exhausted and jet-lagged? \n\n* \"IMO, train travel is the superior mode of transportation, at least in Western Europe. You can see wonderful sites, walk around if the trip is long, drinking and training is a blast, and who doesn\u2019t like trains.. flying is faster and expensive, bus is slower and cheaper.\"\n\n* If you're going to be separated from your bag (e.g. it goes on top of the bus) make sure your passport, cash and other key stuff is with you. Losing clothes is no big deal, losing your passport and bankcards is a major problem\n\n* Sometimes that 4 person dorm room that is that \u00a31 extra is worth it over the 16 person dorm that's likely going to have a snorer.\n\n* \"I have a rule in my email inbox that detects booking confirmation emails from hostel world. Then it automatically forwards it to my mothers email so I don't have to keep updating her where I am\"\n\n* Have footwear that is comfortable. Consider buying comfortable insoles. You're likely to be walking a lot.\n\n* At home I sometimes have clothes that are outdated or have a minor stain or something small so I can't wear it to work anymore. I keep those clothes and wear them on trips, then leave them there. Sometimes I even leave an old suitcase there and travel back home with only my bagpack. I always imagine relatives or the cleaning lady then wearing my clothes in some faraway place.\"\n\n* Sephora sample containers are great for makeup.\n\n* Use packing cubes! When you do laundry, you can just take the dirty laundry cube.\n\n* Carry a powerbank. Handy for you. Handy for helping others.\n\n* In addition to your main backpack, bring a smaller day pack for day-to-day stuff. Consider just buying this at your destination if airline regulations are a pain.\n\n* Download maps.me or use Google Maps offline feature for getting around when you don't have data.\n\n* If you're worried about your safety, remember that Whatsapp have a 'share location' feature with your contact.\n\n* Try to get on the timezone of your destination ASAP, even if it does mean the first day feels like torture.  \n\n* If going to SE Asia, download Grab. It's often used more than Uber, or in a country like Thailand, has the monoply. \n\n* Bring a deck of cards. The worlds best social tool.\n\n* Learn a little of the local language, it makes you look less of a noob and is often appreciated.\n\n*  If using Google maps, consider using their audio direction feature through headphones, instead of looking at your phone like a clueless tourist.\n\n* Take screenshots of your tickets and reservations.\n\n* Upload all your papers in a cloud so you can retrieve them from any computer if you lose your bag/phone.\n\n* If you have 2FA on your Google account (which you should), also print and bring backup codes, in case you lose your phone.\n\n* Bring a spare or old phone if you can. Consider using it if you know you're going to be intoxicated.\n\n* Use street view to explore where you're going before the actual trip, to get a sense of direction to things like your hostel and to familiarise himself with the surroundings. But this is a personal thing - some people prefer the fun of *not knowing*.\n\n* Watch travel vloggers for inspiration or to get a feel for a place.\n\n* Look up local scams so you can spot trouble and avoid it easily.\n\n* If you've done little research, talk to your hostel staff about places to see, things to do &amp; places to avoid.\n\n* Trust your gut. Always. If a hostel is making you feel gross, leave. If a roommate is making you feel uncomfortable, change room or leave.",

I keep a few smaller bills in my wallet, and some coinage/maybe a small bill in a purse or pant pocket (as a secondary searching-for-money location). The bulk of my bills are locked up, or on my body in a very low profile running belt that lays perfectly flat against my skin/under my clothes. And I'm a gal that wears moderately fitted clothing, so looooow profile and no bulk is important. I also kept my passport and cards in there in countries where security and pickpocketing is higher threat. But for haggling, you can decide what your max is, haggle to under that, and if they reeaaaallllyy won't let you get the low point you want, sometimes \"searching\" and finding that tiny extra bit gives them the \"win\". I've even given a friend a fiver to \"lend\" me during the process. You never truly win as the buyer, but you can get a better bargain than paying tag price like an uninitiated haggler!",

It has offline maps where google does not, and it has navigation where google does not allow it.",

In backpacking India for six months I think I only had one hostel that had curtains too. \n\nThailand and Vietnam though it's pretty much expected that you'll have a curtain.

There is nothing worse than a great located Airbnb with a shower that is really wonky or not functioning properly. I\u2019ve had this happen to me before where the flat was fantastic but the shower and bathroom were terrible, the water didn\u2019t get hot enough, the shower head was broken, and as soon as I checked the reviews deep enough these things were mentioned.",

No one is going to buy an iPhone 11 just to have spare, but if you've got an old phone that is decent why not take that? \n\nIt isn't a bad suggestion to use it instead of your \u00a3500-1000 if you're going to be clubbing or getting drunk surely? Losing a phone would be a massive stain on a trip for anyone.\n\nType of advice that most people will ignore and not do then be immediately regretful about not doing it when they've lost their phone in a club.",

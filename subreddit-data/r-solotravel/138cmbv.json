Consider one day trip to Kutn\u00e1 Hora or \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov and enjoy. :)",

For people from the region(s) concerned, it's a fundamental question of history and identity. You WILL offend people in e.g. the Czech Republic if you call them \"Eastern Europeans\" because this ignores basic facts of geography (Vienna is further east than Prague) as well as their entire pre-Communist history as the industrial centre of Austria-Hungary and further back as one of the most culturally-influential regions in central and western European history (as the birthplace of proto-Protestantism with the Hussites and location of many critical events in west/central European history, like the Prague Defenestrations and the assassination of Wallenstein in the 30 Years' War). By slapping them with the label of \"Eastern European\", you're ignoring hundreds of years of key contributions to central/western European history in favour of a few decades in the Communist Bloc. So yeah, people in those countries are going to be offended, and it's not just about the personal preferences of one user on reddit.",

It's one thing to call e.g. the Czech Republic or Slovenia \"eastern Europe\" (even though their capitals are objectively west of Vienna) and then visit these places and change your mind based on your experiences and hearing what locals say. It's another to double down and insist that these places are still \"eastern Europe\" because *you* think so.",

            "comment": "Hi there, the itinerary looks decent. I've went on a solo trip to the Balkans for around a month and can give you my 2 cents.\n\n- Look for bus options if possible (Flixbus is what I used). The train to split from Pag is looking awfully long - bus will be faster and probably cheaper. Maybe an option from Budapest to Zagreb, and to Dubrovnik (The bus is also around 3 hours)? \n- ^ adding to this point, definitely take the train from Vienna to Budapest, I took a late bus from the Vienna bus station (to Ljubljana) and it was awful (long delays and no information available after like 10 p.m.).\n- Be sure to get an early bus to Plitvice as it got REALLY busy when I got there at around 9.30. I waited in the queue to get a ticket for close to 30/40 minutes if I remember correctly. Also, be sure to check the bus timetable and buy your bus tickets in advance!\n- When it comes to Dubrovnik, I only went there for a full day. I saw most of the city, the GOT castle and went around the city walls. I would recommend checking for things to do there as there is not THAT much to see for 2 days (In my opinion). Maybe a day trip to Mostar (Bosnia) or around would be possible?\n\nFor recommendations for additional stops I have a few:\n\n- Zadar; a small city with a lot of Venetian heritage. Good for a day to see the small city.\n\n- Ljubljana is on the way from Budapest to Zagreb. I really enjoyed the city as it has an amazing old town and nice views from the castle in the middle of the city. There isn't that much to see here though and I went to lake Bled for a day from here.\n\nIf you have any questions, just let me know! :)",

Everyone that's been to Budapest typically ends up at Szimpla at some point but there's so much good nightlife. Make some friends or even just go by yourself to some baths for sunbathing such as Seychenyi, it is a must do when in Budapest, and go to the bastion as well.  \n  \nOthers have mentioned going to Mostar for a day from Croatia and I agree! Would be a gorgeous day. \n  \nVienna you can also take a day trip to Slovakia if you want to tick off another place. I went on a tour to Bratislava and met some awesome people, and got a boat ride back down the Danube. Head's up that a lot of stuff including supermarkets are closed on Sundays and public hols. \n  \nIf you enjoy hiking, Saxon Switzerland from Prague makes a nice day out. It's a gorgeous city but be prepared for it to be HOT in August.",

    "postText": "Hi, I am heading backpacking next week and am landing in bangkok around 13:20. I am looking to head straight to Siem Reap from the moment I arrive, by bus.  I was wondering if there are buses throughout the day and if this is possible? I looked on 12goasia, but couldn't find many options. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. It's my first time solo travelling outside of europe and am slightly anxious about things. Cheers",

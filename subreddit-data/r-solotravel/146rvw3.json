    "postText": "I just got into Krabi town. I will be here for a couple of days and then I am moving on to explore the surrounding areas. I am a big rock climber so I will spend a bit of time in Railay and Tonsai. And I\u2019ll definitely check out Koh Phi Phi and Koh Lanta. I\u2019m not as big on partying as I was in my 20s, so I may go to Phuket for just a day or two. But I\u2019m more interested in quiet, beautiful beaches and jungle, adventure, and cultural experiences. Besides the places I\u2019ve mentioned are there any \u201cmust see\u201d places in the area you guys recommend?",

            "comment": "I stayed at Railay itself last year and loved it. The walking street can be a bit gritty at times, but Railay West and Phra Nang beaches are both quite lovely and scenic. \n\nPhi Phi can be a bit disappointing on a busy day - too many tour boats there and at Maya Bay when I was there. \n\nYou could drive up country to Samed Nangshe viewpoint. The beaches of Khao Lak are nice and laid back as well.\n\nNever been to Koh Lanta but heard great stuff about it. Was also recommended Koh Yao Noi and Koh Yao Yai islands as great places to unwind.",

            "comment": "Sounds like you\u2019ve got a great itinerary started! Railay has the most beautiful beaches I\u2019ve ever seen, and I always stay there rather than Krabi town. They offer rope climbing at two of the beaches and you can book tours to boulder some of the limestone karsts in the ocean. There\u2019s caves and hikes on railay as well. Koh phi phi is quite touristy, but is a great base. I went to Phuket once and it was quite a let down. From any of those points though, they offer some incredible tours!",

I\u2019ve got one more day here. Probably going to go for a jungle trek or ATV ride. Then I\u2019ll head out to Phi Phi for just a couple of nights to do some scuba. Then I\u2019m going to spend maybe a week in Railay climbing. I\u2019m still trying to decide if I want to make it up to Koh Yao Noi and Yai. So after Railay I\u2019m either going to head up north to those islands. Or I\u2019m going to head to Lanta to just relax away from the party vibe. Still not sure if I care to go to Phuket. If I do it will maybe be for one night just to experience it.",

            "comment": "I loved staying at Railay like the others but Ao Nang is slightly more of a town and all the smaller islands are easily accessible from there. I was there in April and everything pretty much closed at 10 or 11 so it was pretty quiet. You know, if you're looking for a quiet place with a few more restaurants and 7-Eleven near the incredible beaches.",

            "comment": "Let's see if I remember my time there.....\n\nIf youre certified, the Scuba diving off Krabi is on point. Tons of fish, sharks, sea snakes, think I even saw a few octipii (? Is that the plural) on that dive.\n\nThe Tiger temple was pretty cool. A short moderate effort hike on mostly stairs. Phenomenal views from the top.\n\nDragons Crest hike was very good and great Instagram photo ops with the henge on the upper Ridgeline. It's not technical at all outside of some elevation gain. You'll need to rent a scooter for a few dollars to get there. That in and of itself is also an experience and fun to explore on. \n\n\nThere's a pretty cool gym in town if you're into weight lifting but I can't remember the name. \n\nAnd some of the Thai boxing clubs are cool to watch fights. \n\nMy best experience there was stumbling into probably the only British pub in Thailand outside of Bangkok during the Manchester United vs Liverpool game. Every expat from the hills came out for that.",

I think I\u2019m gonna plan to go diving once I get to Phi Phi. I\u2019ve thought about doing more of the jungle trek stuff while I\u2019m here on the mainland. And then I\u2019ll get in my water sports once I head out to the islands. So far it\u2019s awesome here.",

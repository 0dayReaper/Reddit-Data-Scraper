    "postText": "31m and heading over to Europe for a couple of months in July.  I'd like to start with a group tour to ease into the solo aspect as it's been several years.\n\nI'm really interested in the Contiki Scandinavia tour, which is 12 days. Apparently the groups are huge (40 people), but I am assuming that this particular tour would be less party-centric because of the location?\n\nHas anyone done it before and had a good trip? What was the age range? How do they assign people to dorms, eg do you dorm with the same 4-6 people the whole trip (unfortunately no single room option!).\n\nI'm aware of Intrepid, G Adventures and Top Deck, however they don't seem to have trips I'm interested in with availability around this date.",

Again not a party trip but on the couple of opportunities to go out, there were people who just came for some drinks but not clubbing. Others who chilled in other ways. I would think with 40 odd people, even more chance you will find people to hang with who don\u2019t want to party. \n\nThat trip skewed older - which probably reflected the locations. But I\u2019ve always found Contiki really helpful if you contact them - they\u2019ve told me average / age range of people already booked onto a group before, and could probably tell you bit about the vibe",

The accommodations and food were meh, but what was unacceptable was surprising us with a visit to Dachau without any warning. (You do not surprise people with an unexpected visit to a death camp).",

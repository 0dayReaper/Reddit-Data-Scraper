    "postText": "Hello everyone! \n\nI'm writing this post because I would like to ask for advice and warnings before I start making reservations for my initial plan, as this will be the first time I travel solo as a backpacker.   \nFirstly, I'm going to travel through the Balkans in July and August. The route I have in mind is   \nBosnia-Serbia-Hungary-Romania-Bulgaria-Macedonia-Albania, starting either from Bosnia or Albania. I don't have a time limitation, but it has to be in July, August or even the first two weeks of September. An important aspect is that, except for Budapest, I'm not particularly interested in visiting the most touristic capitals or cities. I want this trip to focus on getting to know different cultures, interacting with locals or other backpackers, and being surrounded by nature. For example, I would like to visit Kravica Waterfall (Bosnia), Belogradchik fortress (Bulgaria), Struga (Macedonia). Regarding transportation, I prefer to travel by bus or train.\n\nTherefore, I would like to ask: \n\nWhat do you think of the route? \n\nWould you discard any of the countries? \n\nShould I  take advantage of being in Bulgaria to visit Turkey and exclude other countries? \n\nDo you have any recommendations on specific places, hostels, or things I shouldn't miss in any of the countries? \n\nFinally, if anyone is planning to visit any of these countries this summer, please let me know so we can share experiences and if we happen to be in Budapest, we can even grab a drink at one of the Ruin Bars.\n\nThank you very much, I really appreciate any response!",

            "comment": "Confirming what others said, trains will be a nightmare. Busses are your best bet **but** despite preference, I might consider renting a car. I think it's the only region where it's particularly ideal, especially if you're not hitting capitals. Just be aware Albania would make that tough. \n\nI think your itinerary order needs a big overhaul. Speaking from experience, I strongly suggest starting or ending in Hungary. It'll be the most out of the way, and also the easiest to fly into/out of. \n\nThere's also a *lot* of zig zagging, with a lot of ground to cover. Particularly if you're avoiding capitals/cities, this is going to be a problem. I recommend keeping things in as straight a line as possible, or a big loop that minimizes travel distance. It'll be a more enjoyable journey for you, but logistically, you'll have an easier time getting to places. \n\nFinally, unless you're specifically avoiding it for a reason, I think it's a miss to exclude Croatia. Plitvice Lakes National Park is only a 3.5 hour journey from Karvica, on a route that takes you through Split and Zadar areas which are well worth a stop too. :)",

In Bulgaria, one of the biggest monuments is the Alexander Nevski capital, and it is dedicated to the Russian, Ukrainian and Finish soldiers (and other minorities of the Russian Empire) who fought to help Bulgaria be free. \n\nAnother one is the 7 lakes. It is a touristic spot, but it is amazing as hell. 7 lakes in the middle of the mountains.\n\nTouristic spots, and this applies very well to the Balkans, are associated with the history and culture of the country, showing no interest in them is showing no interest in their culture.",

                    "comment": "Hi! It seems like I didn't express myself well. By touristy, I mean places like Kotor or Ksamil that are very touristy, beachy places where foreigners are drinking mojitos in the streets. I have to assume that there will be tourists like me, but I want 80% of my time to be spent in small villages in the interior or mountains, being in nature in the Balkans, where I can interact more directly with locals and learn about their way of life and traditions. Then, I want to dedicate the remaining 20% to the capitals and places like the ones you recommended that have more tourism, but that I still want to visit. However, there is a big difference between going in high or low season, and I want to adapt to these circumstances. I definitely won't miss the Alexander Nevski capital and I'll check out the 7 lakes since I didn't know about them before. Thanks for the recommendation!",

            "comment": "If you are interested in nature Montenegro is a must, you can't skip it. The coastal cities are insanely beautiful, I only went to Kotor and Budva but I will surely later go back to visit the rest. \n\nTrains are limited or even non-existent for international routes, you will have to take buses. I recommend BalkanViator and GetByBus to search, since rome2rio doesn't show many options on some of those countries.\n\nYou could go to Turkey but for the time's sake I imagine you'd go only to Istanbul and the city requires a bit of time, if you can manage it why not.\n\nEven tough you are not interested in capitals i wouldn't also skip Sarajevo, it's a city where you will see and learnt a lot.\n\nI've visited all the capitals in the balkans and some minor cities, probably not many related with what you really want (besides Mostar and the Montenegrian ones), but if you need anything feel free to message me.\n\nYou will love those countries btw. Cheers and have fun",

                    "comment": "Hi there! Thank you so much for your response! \n\nMontenegro was and still is one of my top choices, but I had to discard it because I read that  both Kotor and Budva are very touristy during the months I am going, and  as I could see on Hostelworld, the prices are much higher compared to  other countries in the area. That's why I had to rule it out, but I will definitely go back during a different time of the year. \n\nAs for Turkey, it seems like a very good option, but I wanted to know if it fits my   \nplans for peace and nature because from what little I know about Istanbul, it has much more to do with a city setting than a natural one. \n\nRegarding Sarajevo, I will definitely add it to my list. Probably the transportation to Serbia will take me there, and if you recommend it, I will spend a few days there. That way, I won't just be among mountains, and it seems very interesting from a historical standpoint as well. \n\nI really appreciate your responde.",

They also organize a day tour to see the Kravica waterfall and other spots in Bosnia&amp;Herzegovina which was fun.  \nIf you like nature, you can also visit Konjic which is between Sarajevo&amp;Mostar. It's a small city/village but nice nature and rafting.\n\nJust beware not to do too much, because busses might not go as planned. You currently have 7 countries on your want-to-visit list and are thinking of adding even more. You say you don't have a time limit, but you have 2.5 months so I guess that's your time limit and that way you already have max 1-2 weeks per country which might be ok for countries like Bosnia&amp;Herzegovina or Montenegro, but for the bigger countries that means you have to pick your favourite spots to visit.\n\nFor which way to visit - july-september are the hottest months so maybe you can check when which spots are less hot",

Mostar is a place I would love to visit,but I'm worried that there will be too many tourists at that time ofyear. That's why I also want to avoid Kotor, so I'll have an excuse to come back a second time during the off-season. Perhaps Konjic would be a betteroption in that regard, and I'll definitely make a note of it. Regardingtransportation, I have already been doing some research, and even thoughI will probably end up opting for buses, I will take into account whatyou've told me. I'll simplify my route accordingly, and that's whycontributions like yours are so helpful. As for the heat, I don't thinkit'll be a problem for me since I'm used to temperatures of 45 degreesin my region during the summer. Once again, thank you so much for yourresponse!",

It was called Hostel Mustafir. So that's also an option of getting to know a local.\n\nMostar was very busy, to me it actually seemed more busy than Kotor! Both were pretty cities but very touristic. Mostar kind of only has the 1 bridge where people go, but Kotor also had some stuff outside of the walled city center so the people were more spread out.\n\nAlso, if you want nature, Zabljak in Montenegro was really pretty! There are some nice hiking trails in that area",

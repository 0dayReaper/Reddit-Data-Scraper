    "postText": "I don't want to travel solo again this summer as I feel I have been doing this out of necessity rather than because of my own choice. And that makes me sad and frustrated. I have friends, but everybody seem to be involved with their own thing. I am doing a trip with them in my country but to a place I've already been a few times with them. They like to go back there and I hate going always to the same place but I said yes because I am afraid I will end up alone for this summer season. Don't get me wrong, I like their company and it's fun but I am more adventurous and always get frustrated that I want to visit the world but I don't have company for that. I did solo traveling in the past, I enjoyed it but let's be real. There's always an element of bittersweetness to it. It's sad not to be able to share with people emotions, meals and conversations. It's nice to have the freedom of course. But that comes with a cost. Ideally I would do a solo trip for a few days combined with a trip with friends. I am gay and  love nature, I did solo trips to gay friendly places before and was able to meet people which was great. I have several friends all over the world because I lived overseas as well, but either they are coupled or they are doing their own thing or our schedules don't match. I am jealous of people that can take all these amazing trips with their like minded friends... Sorry for the rant!",

            "comment": "Solution wise, I agree with those that said organized tour, especially ones that are for younger groups, and the adventurous style. They tend to be pricier than self organized but I always find some fun people on them. \n\nRant wise, I feel you 100%, every single word you said. My closest friends are adventurous but they have commitments like school, jobs, etc. So there's not much opportunity for long trips, for shorter trips it's easiest to meet in CA so we end up going to similar places (which still happy it's time with them). It's not just traveling, but overall people tend to get settled into their own lives sadly. I don't think it's very often people take long trips with friends unless it's their gap year or couples or something. You can find more like-minded people on Reddit or FB groups but honestly, you don't know the vibe of someone before meeting them in person.",

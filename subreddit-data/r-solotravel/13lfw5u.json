    "postText": "I'm five months into a solo trip, ending soon, working remotely. Currently with two friends, just for a week, not working/am on vacation. (I don't know why the post tag is North America; I am from the U.S. but am traveling in Italy.)\n\nAs happens on group travel, there have been some differing energies throughout the week, but I thought that overall things were working, and I was looking forward to traveling with these people again.\n\nTonight, though, things came to a head. We were out at a bar, one friend wanted to stay, I wanted to leave, the other friend was neutral. We left, and my friend who had wanted to stay said I had bad energy, that my time alone had put me in a different headspace, and that she didn't want to travel with me again.\n\nI'm heartbroken (while also acknowledging that this just happened and that people vent). I anticipate this will affect our friendship.\n\nBut what I want to know from this thread is: Has solo travel made you a bad travel partner? I know I have gotten much more willing to have downtime, and to not chase The Great Experience in Destination X than I was before. That has made my solo travel better. But maybe it has made me less willing to have fun? Less willing to have the extra drink, to stay the extra hour? I don't want to be a bad travel partner!\n\n\n\nEdit for update: I didn't mean for this to turn into a YTA, but I guess the way I framed the question certainly elicited that! \n\nFor the asshole angle: The next morning, my friend was waiting for me with a huge apology, beginning with, literally, \"I was being an asshole and I'm sorry.\" She is a great friend whose tongue gets mighty sharp after a few drinks, and that's what happened here, and she acknowledged it was shitty of her to say she wouldn't travel with me again, and that overall she had a great time. (I did too.) For context, we had agreed on a nightcap, and then she wanted to stay until people started dancing, which was looking to be a couple more hours (it was 12:30 when she said she wanted to stay). Compromise is important, as many commenters pointed out, but we had already gone through a few compromises by the time this happened. I also appreciate the comments about how I should have rallied. I disagree, but it's giving me more sympathy for my friend's perspective. (For the record, I met up with her after her business trip in Italy - she did not cross an ocean just to see me.)\n\nAs for the larger question: I will do a few things differently next time I travel with anyone, specifically:\n\n1) Remember my need for alone time, and plan accordingly. Because it was just a week and this is one of my best friends (and the other friend is also great), I wanted to eke out every moment, so I hadn't had ANY alone time. I wasn't near cracking but I think I was more strained than I realized. I know I require a lot of alone time. I'd had a LOT of it over the months so I thought it would be ok, but it's like sleep; I can't bank it. I had an urge to skip the main activity for the day, and I should have, because it was a thing I had little desire to do and that both of the other two really wanted to do, so they could have gone together and I'd have had time to recharge. Lesson learned. \n\n2) Be specific when discussing the vision for the trip. We had all said we wanted \"a couple of nights out.\" To me, that means a nice boozy dinner and maybe 1-2 more drinks. So we'd been \"going out\" every night, in my mind! Meanwhile, my friend was waiting to \"go out\" because she was envisioning drinking into the wee hours and dancing. I hadn't realized that, as she and I tend to hang out at one another's homes, not out. So, next time I travel with anyone, I'll be clearer about what vague statements (\"nights out,\" \"relaxed pace,\" \"nice dinner\") mean. \n\nThere are some great tips in this thread overall. Thanks to everyone! I will always prefer solo travel, I think, but I do want the option to travel with others. It was wonderful to be able to share travel experiences with friends - I have had some stunning solo hikes. But hiking The Path of the Gods with two people I love was something I will treasure forever, and something that deepens my relationship with both them and with the location.",

Traveling longterm means there's less of an urge to have every day be totally packed with experiences because you're thinking more about pacing things sustainably. I don't think that's a bad thing, though I can understand why that style of travel might clash with someone who's traveling short term.",

If someone wants to go off and so something no one would bat an eyelid or think ill of it.

I had 3 days solo at the start, then met up with a few friends spent a couple of nights going out together as they'd just arrived but we all had separate hotels, then we each went on separate mini cruises for 2 days, then spent a week in the south of the country to relax at beachside hotel together before going our separate ways. \n\nSharing a trip with a friend where you're sleeping at the same place, doing all the same activities, having every meal together just seems very suffocating to me, at least for more than a week.",

I think it's more than fair that she feels neglected when you're treating this as just another week in your trip and not a special time you want to make the most of. You should have a conversation with your friend around what both of your expectations for this trip were and how you can make them feel heard. That might mean that you have a couple of days that are more packed than you would prefer, or maybe your friends break off to explore some sights solo. \n\nTo answer your question more generally, I think solo travel has made me more aware of the travel styles I enjoy (or do **not** enjoy), which in turn has made me more selective about who I travel with. Having a companion requires more flexibility than being alone, but you also want a buddy whose ultimate goals/interests/stamina are similar so you're not butting heads over the fundamentals. Being friends with someone doesn't necessarily mean you would travel (or live) well together, which is a lesson I think most of us learn the hard way. \n\nI try to plan a shorter, domestic trip first before committing to an international trip with someone new for the first time. A 3 or 4-day weekend can give you a lot of insight into someone's travel style and how compatible you are, without the pressure of it being a \"once in a lifetime\" experience.",

            "comment": "Mine is a slightly different issue, but last summer I traveled to Barcelona with a friend who I\u2019d never traveled with before. From the get-go it became pretty clear that we\u2019re not compatible hotel roommates. \n\nShe\u2019s one of those effortlessly pretty people who takes no more than 15 minutes to get ready in the morning. In the time it took me to brush my teeth, she\u2019d already be brushed, dressed, hair and makeup done, ready to go. I just take a lot longer to get going in the morning. I brush my teeth for longer than most people, I do a little stretch routine that I can\u2019t skip or I\u2019ll feel sore and tight all day, and I have a somewhat long skincare routine. When I travel with people I am quicker about things and wake up earlier so I can do what I need to do and stay on schedule. But this friend was adamant that she\u2019s a light sleeper and if I woke up even a half hour earlier, it would make her wake up too and mess up her sleep schedule. She got very bossy about what time we should both wake up. \n\nAlso, she likes to be in icy cold air conditioning at all times, especially while sleeping, whereas I get a sore throat if the AC is cranked up too much. She got bossy about the AC too and refused to compromise on it. I ended up wearing a scarf to bed every night (in Barcelona in August) but still had a sore throat every morning. \n\nOutside of the hotel things were mostly good, but a few weird things. She didn\u2019t want to pay for an international data plan (idk why, it\u2019s cheap and she makes 6 figures) so she couldn\u2019t text or use the internet or GPS unless she was on wifi. We were out exploring all day every day so we rarely had wifi outside of the hotel. So I had to handle all of the navigating and researching. \n\nShe\u2019s also in much better physical shape than me (she works out at Orange Theory) and walks very fast, and was always reluctant to slow down even slightly for me. There was no steep hill that she didn\u2019t want to walk up. So I was always forced to keep up with her because if we got separated we had no way of contacting each other unless she found wifi. Granted I did get in good shape that week from trying to keep up with her pace, but I wasn\u2019t too keen on all the unnecessary huffing and puffing in 85 degree August weather. \n\nOther than all of that the trip was mostly really good. We had similar interests in terms of eating, going out, and sightseeing. But I was kind of a pushover and rolled over on most conflicts because I didn\u2019t want to make things more tense, and it was an eye opener to discover she just has a brain block about compromising about certain things and at times can lack empathy. We have visited each other a couple of times since that trip so things seem fine with us, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be sharing a hotel room again!",

Your friend probably wanted to spend more quality time with you considering that this was the one opportunity that she could. Also for those in the comments who are saying that this friend isn't independent, think about how you would feel if you took time to visit a friend and you felt like that friend was behaving in a way that made you feel like they don't want to be with you. When people travel with friends especially if it's just for a week, it's not unreasonable of them to not want to go off alone and actually spend time with their friend. This is why having open communication and a conversation is so important because you can learn how you can potentially compromise and see how the other person is feeling. Also if you can't compromise for one week for a close friend that it's possible that you need to look at yourself more closely.",

Not everyone gets it and that\u2019s usually okay if you have clear communication. \n\nBut every once in a while you\u2019ll have someone like your friend who \u201closes\u201d or doesn\u2019t get what they want because you decided to do your own thing and people follow. Those types of people don\u2019t usually make good travel buddies themselves imo, but they might say the same about us. Different strokes, it\u2019s okay to not be travel compatible with everyone.",

So you have the freedom to do whatever you like, go wherever and leave whenever. I\u2019m very open to do whatever.

We get together at the end of the day to share a meal and the experiences we had that day.\nI can't speak to your 'bad energy' but sounds like your friend was pissy because you didn't want to stay out when she did.

I\u2019m the same way on straight vacations.\n\nOp is essentially living a normal daily living &amp; working life while traveling. She\u2019s had 5 months of opportunities to go out and do all the things she wanted already. She has no feelings of needing to \u201cget the most out of\u201d her every night while vacationing.\n\nThey are simply not compatible for this type of trip. It doesn\u2019t mean they wouldn\u2019t be in the future if it was a simple regular vacation for them all.\n\nThey all had a few drinks and OP mentioned in the comments that the neutral friend was safe to stay at the bar but that the disagreeing friend was not safe to stay at the bar.\n\nMeaning she was probably quite drunk. The friend is clearly just simply hurt and feeling neglected and feeling like she\u2019s not having a fun trip. And she\u2019s talking about it while drunk.\n\nThey need a sober conversation in the morning.",

I relate to the frustration of wanting to have lively, spontaneous, shared experiences with friends who want to go home to bed. It\u2019s an energy mismatch. \n\nWhen I solo travel, I indulge myself. When I travel with others, I indulge others and go with the flow. I let go of it being about me and what I want to do. If there are things I really wanna do but the group don\u2019t, I go off and do my own thing for a bit and regroup later. If someone else has an idea for something to do that might not be my speed, I stay open to giving everything a go (one of the reasons I solo travel to begin with). \n\nThere are lots of people who solo travel because they can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to compromise, that\u2019s something that can make a bad travel partner imo.",

For example if you stayed longer maybe  she would have hangover following day or just some exhaustion and would easily get irrated about some trivial stuff which would then cause an argument\u2026",

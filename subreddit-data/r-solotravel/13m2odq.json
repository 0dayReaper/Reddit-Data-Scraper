    "postText": "Hello everyone, I (22M) will be solo traveling to India in the month of July, specifically in the state of Rajasthan. I am actually quite nervous as my understanding of traveling India is that of intense culture shock. I am also nervous because I know that July is really not an ideal time at all to visit India, but I am choosing to make it work the best I can. \n\nI am coming to this community to ask for guidance, tips for traveling through Northern India, and quite frankly maybe some positive experiences or practical advice before I start my journey. I feel like a lot of my reading of other peoples experiences in India has been fairly negative, overwhelming and uncomfortable, and because of this I frequently get pretty anxious about starting my journey. I think it would be really helpful for me to hear from people what it is that they have loved about their experiences in India to remind me of why I am going in the first place. \n\nI have only solo-travelled long term one other time in South East Asia for two months. I know traveling this time around will be quite a different experience and it will push me out of my comfort zone more than SEA did. My goals for traveling is to push myself and to gain experience going to uncomfortable places, so I like to think I am in the correct headspace for India and I think I have a good idea of what I am getting myself into. \n\nI will be there for anywhere between 3-5 weeks, and the rough itinerary of cities I am interested in visiting is as follows:\n\n1. Flying into Delhi from Kathmandu (I will be in Nepal for a month prior to my time in India). I really have no intention on exploring Delhi at all. From my general research from other travellers to India I hear it is really not a city much worth exploring. Am I wrong in skipping Delhi altogether?\n2. Varanasi. I am very interested in exploring Varanasi. I plan on either going to Varanasi directly from Delhi at the onset of my trip or saving it as the last place I visit before I fly out. I know it is quite a bit out of the way from Rajasthan so I'm not entirely sure when it makes most sense to make the journey east. \n3. Agra, planning on going to Agra just for the day to see the Taj Mahal and then leaving.\n4. Jaipur \n5. Pushkar\n6. Bundi \n7. Jodhpur\n8. Jaisalmer \n9. Udaipur \n10. Fly from Udaipur to Delhi (?)\n\nAny tips or recommendations on this rough itinerary are certainly welcome. Again, I really am hoping to just hear about some positive experiences in India and some practical tips for making it through. I really appreciate any insight the community has to offer.",

It will take away some of the frustrations that come with planning because it's very difficult to organise things in India. Plans always fall through. Plus when the country gets too overwhelming you have other foreigners on your trip who are experiencing the same thing, so you definitely feel less lost",

It will be intense and overwhelming. But if you\u2019re mentally prepared for things to not go to plan, it will be ok. \n\nThis being said, I have seen the most incredible things in india. Some of the sites I have seen are just mind blowing. So incredible. And some of the hotels I\u2019ve stayed in have been incredible too. The thing that frightened me the most on my first trip - the roads - have become my favourite thing. I love catching an auto and just enjoying the chaos. \n\nI\u2019ve never travelled solo or in the north. My fianc\u00e9 has an apartment in the south so that has always been our base. But I think some things are true all over India:\n- locals go to hill stations to escape the heat. It will be really hot. \n- don\u2019t overplan your days, things take a bit longer there. Traffic is slow, public transport doesn\u2019t run on time. \n- carry toilet paper and hand sanitiser with you. Toilets in india typically don\u2019t have toilet paper, from memory. (The locals often use water to clean themselves instead)\n\nYou\u2019ll be right, you\u2019ll work it out and have a very powerful travel experience.",

This is the prime example of difficulty for enjoyment factor.\n\nIndia is amazing but (as many other people have said) also can be very frustrating &amp; difficult at times. I spent about half the time I was there pissed off &amp; annoyed &amp; wondering what the hell I was doing, &amp; the other half having the time of my life. Most travellers I\u2019ve met have a love/hate relationship with India. But it gets under your skin &amp; you can never wait to get back.\n\nI can only speak from my experience (pale, blonde &amp; blue-eyed) but as a foreigner, you will stand out ALOT. People will stare, &amp; ask for photos, &amp; stop you to chat. \n\nJust roll with it, that\u2019s the most important part. Try not to get annoyed, ask people questions, talk to them. The most interesting experiences I had were not at monuments or tourist attractions but with random people I met on the street. \nOne example-I was walking back to my hostel from the Taj Mahal in Agra (thru a poor neighbourhood) and a kid said \u2018Hey motherfucker\u2019 so I replied \u2018Hey Chutiya\u2019 (Hindi for asshole) to which he replied \u2018Hey bitch\u2019 and so on &amp; so forth\u2026I then proceeded to teach him a bunch of English swear words while he taught me more Hindi swear words.\nThat\u2019s just a particular memory that sticks out, but when you go with the flow in India you\u2019ll have many of these strange, beautiful interactions.\n\nAlso Rajasthan will be hot as hell! I\u2019d recommend heading to Rishikesh from Delhi (which is way more chill then the rest of India so a good place to start off) then head north to Dehradun &amp; the Himalayas, it is the perfect time of year for the north.\n\nYes there\u2019s difficult parts about travelling to India, but on the whole it\u2019s unbelievably rewarding &amp; will change your view on life. Be prepared for kindness like you wouldn\u2019t believe, food that will ruin all other cuisine for you, oh and a country full of unbelievable landscapes.\n\nYeah should read up about the history of India a little bit, even a basic understanding will help a lot, have a basic knowledge of Hinduism (it\u2019s a very complicated religion). Indians will generally appreciate it &amp; be very impressed if you can converse about these things.\n\nLearn some Hindi! You can get by easily without it but basic phrases come in handy. Even just thank you, delicious, no, how much is this and make your price less will go along way. I\u2019ve found a quick dam kam karo will go along way when bargaining &amp; people won\u2019t try &amp; rip you off as hard as they would because it shows you\u2019ve been around the block a bit.\nThe best bit is you can ask any Indian &amp; they will teach you, especially swear words.\n\nPractical advice-download Ixigo app for train &amp; bus bookings, you can use an international card you will just need to create an IRCTC account beforehand.",

Saying that, it is the most incredible country I have ever visited and I am going back again to visit for many months. The culture shock can be intense, just accept that you are going to feel uncomfortable sometimes and try not to apply your own standards to the behaviours you seem. You are going to see intense levels of poverty, severely disabled children begging in the streets, rows of people shitting on the train tracks, complete disregard for personal space and a lack of basic hygiene. Not everywhere, not all the time, but often you are going to experience this. If you are white, especially blonde hair, then you will stand out and get stares, people will want to take a picture with you or have you hold your baby - if this makes you uncomfortable then be assertive, say no and walk away and they should leave you alone.\n\nDelhi has some cool sites, I definitely wouldn't skip it completely. Agra on the other hand only has the Taj Mahal and is not worth any extra time. Varanasi is incredible, completely worth going out your way for. I loved Upaidur also.",

I did a trip, all by train, where I visited Delhi, Varanasi, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, back to Jodhpur, then bus to Udaipur. I booked my night trains online before I left, and mostly travelled second-class AC, which was nice.\n\nIn Jodhpur, I highly recommend the flying fox zipwires, where you zipwire off the fort.

I had one 45-hour trip from Madurai to Jaipur that turned out to be a favourite part of the trip. As long as you book the AC classes (1A, 2A) the trains are just fine. Jaipur to Varanasi is a lunch-to-morning train, so you\u2019ll have a nice afternoon onboard and get off just before breakfast.\n\nI found the Indian trains lovely, clean and well serviced by catering and salespeople. There is nothing like hanging out the door with a cup of tea at sunset.\n\nThe booking website is the most bullshit IT solution I have ever come across though. Also, try to book at least a week ahead of you can. They have a wait-list system for full trains and I managed to get a space on the train even with 20-30 before me in the WL queue, but that was a bit stressful.\n\nBut, I just want to comfort you: long-distance trains are air-conditioned sleepers and perfectly fine.",

It lives on the spectrum of extremes... colors, smells, traffic, pollution, food, crowd, and so much more. That being said, it can certainly give you perspective.\n\nYour plan looks good. I'd recommend a few things. Get an eSim or local number. Uber and Ola (Indian Uber) are available in cities, so you can get around easily with them. Many shops either accept UPI (India's contactless system) or cash, so keep cash handy. Join group tours; you can avoid a lot of unnecessary meddling and scamming. I really recommend checking out Ladakh/Himachal Pradesh - amazing landscapes, people, and great vibe overall. When crossing a road, just put up your hand and vehicles will stop or go around you. And do try Indian street food; it's unlike anything you may have eaten.",

The bigger issue would be monsoon rains or not.\n\nYo OafSauce, well I (Aussie) lived in &amp; travelled around India for more than a decade, based in Rajasthan for usually Oct - April-ish, and Himachal Pradesh (Kullu Valley, Manali area mostly) + Ladakh for May - Sept/Oct - with the occasional Goa in Jan/Feb.  Travelled widely around most other areas, not so much the south.\n\nJuly in Rajasthan &amp; Varanasi will be *bloody very hot lol!*  If it\u2019s still monsooning that\u2019s the worse part more than just the heat.   BUT, missing Rajasthan &amp; Benares would be a sad tragedy indeed.   Just do as locals - get up &amp; out early, drink plenty of water + electrolytes, siesta in the shade/guest house/hotel during midday, go out again before dusk &amp; home by not too late - not much happens &amp; not so safe wandering around India after 9/10pm-ish unless at local festivals where are familys n kids n stuff.  Beware of mosquito bite - PLENTY of dengue mozzies around monsoon.\n\nYou\u2019re right in thinking to miss Delhi - yeah there are some sights etc but it\u2019s a horrid polluted mega-city.  I do have an itinerary idea that would still get you at least some of what you want to see,  during probably the worst touristic sightseeing weather month of the whole year lol.\n\nShort version - **AC bus/train from Katmandu to Varanasi, direct AC train from Varanasi to Pushkar (that would be a train to Ajmer, a few kms from Pushkar), AC sleeper bus to Jaipur/Udaipur,** and if the heat / monsoon of the plains is proving too much, then AC train to Delhi &amp; AC luxury tourist bus escape up to the Himalayas.  Kullu Valley area is stunning, as is Ladakh (culturally Tibetan).  ((((Don\u2019t bother with Dharmsala it\u2019s not that special if you\u2019ve been in Nepal &amp; don\u2019t bother with Rishikesh so what if the BeetLeS went there in the 60\u2019s now it\u2019s a shithole of tourist scammers &amp; fake yogis.)))\n\nDon\u2019t FLY Ktm - Delhi, just get the bus/train from Katmandu DIRECT DOWN TO VARANASI.  It\u2019s so close &amp; it\u2019s a well-utilised &amp; well-travelled backpackers / travellers route.  All the travel shops in Katmandu can get you those tickets.  Daytimes in Ktm will be hot, but as you descend the Himalayas down to the Terai &amp; Indian plains, the heat &amp; humidity will ratchet up a few hundred notches lol.\n\nVaranasi in monsoon season is - umm - wow.  Lol hard but doable, for a few days / a week.   You\u2019ll need to siesta during midday hours, it\u2019s just too hot out there, and if it\u2019s pissing rain, all the streets flood &amp; turn into sewers.\n\n..If you see Pushkar, Jaipur, Udaipur/Jodhpur, don\u2019t bother with Bundi it\u2019s TINY and most guest houses &amp; tourist restaurants probably closed due to tourist off-season.  Jaisalmer - yeah it\u2019s stunning but there\u2019s basically only the fort there not much else, and the heat in July will be SCORCHING PUNISHING desert no joke.\n\nI\u2019d normally recommend first-timers to land &amp; go directly to Pushkar, great place to get over the initial India-landing culture shock &amp; a little used to it all.  It\u2019s a small pilgrim town on a holy lake so you can walk around the whole town in an hour.  It\u2019s a long-time hippy &amp; freaks hang out since decades, more recent decades a centre for Europeans / westerners who make their freaky clothing &amp; jewellery to sell in European / American markets &amp; festivals, so Pushkar is well set up to cater to foreign travellers, plenty lovely guest houses &amp; funky restaurants / cafes / etc, plenty of locals speak English as well as other foreign languages.  It\u2019s a good spring-board &amp; center to radiate out from using AC sleeper busses / trains to travel to other places around Rajasthan.  You\u2019ve already been in Nepal for a month so it\u2019s a bit of a softer landing, plus as you observe, the distances are great for one who wants to see Varanasi AND Rajasthan.  Since in Ktm you\u2019re so close to Varanasi, I\u2019d say just go down to Benares then train across direct to Pushkar.  Radiate out from there.\n\nCheck it out, think it over, &amp; see what you think.  Omg you\u2019re gonna have the trip of a lifetime!  India can be tough &amp; hard but WOW it\u2019s amazing!  :)",

It\u2019s loud, dirty and frustrating but it\u2019s also absolutely fantastic. Granted my first India experience was very different from what yours is going to be I\u2019ve also just randomly solo traveled and had a great time. I went for the first time for a year long student exchange when I was 16. Lived with a host family, went to school, fell in love with the country and keep going back every two years. I now speak Hindi which of course helps but there are plenty of regions where no one speaks Hindi and I\u2019ve still had a great time so that doesn\u2019t matter. I would recommend learning  a couple of phrases before you go anyways (if you want some help with that feel free to drop me a message). \n\nI was in Pune (with brief trips to the south east and central India) for all of July and August last year. The monsoon really doesn\u2019t make for the best travel weather in the South. It\u2019ll be very hot in Rajasthan but imo not too hot to enjoy it, just get up early. Himachal is a beautiful place and not so hot but if you\u2019re just coming from Nepal maybe you wanna see something besides mountains again. \n\nFor me, the most important thing in India is to just roll with whatever is going on. Nothing is ever on time and people change plans all the time. Once you just accept that you\u2019re gonna have the best time! If you\u2019re white and especially if you\u2019re also blonde people are gonna stare, ask you for a picture, to hold their baby, etc. You can easily get caught up in doing that for a good while so eventually I just started saying no. Don\u2019t feel bad and be assertive. Same for people on the street trying to sell you stuff. If you keep walking and don\u2019t look at them directly they will for the most part leave you alone. Otherwise you can go with \u201cnahi chahiye\u201d (I don\u2019t want/need) or if they\u2019re very persistent \u201cpareshan mat karo\u201d (stop bothering me). \n\nBesides that just wandering the city is a great way to soak it all up. One of the best parts of visiting India imo is just experiencing the country the way it is. Of course there are beautiful sights, temples etc that you should by all means go to but just get lost for a little while and enjoy the atmosphere. And then get an Ola back to your accommodation and enjoy the streets that way. \n\nI hope you have a great time!",

Then I look to my left and there\u2019s an old man taking a shit in the open. \n\nWhat helped me a lot is to find groups of people to meet with, as much as possible. I volunteered with a nonprofit for a week and that helped. On another Instance, I found a photography club on Facebook and hung out with them a few days. I event went on a date with a local and had a really incredible time. So don\u2019t just walk around on your own. Find others, even if it\u2019s just a group tour or a bar crawl with a hostel.",

Maybe you wanna land there and travel to Delhi/agra.\n\nDefinitely do not miss Delhi if you like historical sites and try out north Indian Street food. Even if not, it could be a good city experience to wind down for a couple of days.\n\nRajasthan is great for a solo traveller if you discount the heat in July. July is the arrival of Monsoon in northern India so you might get lucky but I would postpone Rajasthan as much as I could.\n\nIf you are looking for alternatives, maybe try southern India. Goa, Pune, Hyderabad, Kerala. Some of these places may have excess rains/storms so consult weather advisories but in general, if you don't mind getting wet or the occasional water logging, you would enjoy it. \n\nDo not go to the mountains in July, it rains heavier than some parts of South India. A lot of roads are blocked and there are increased chances of natural disasters.",

Went there in 2018 right after I graduated high school with 4 of my friends that I grew up with and we did a similar trip around North India. Here\u2019s what I can say:\n\n1. The culture shock will be intense and will likely stem from the sheer number of people (the metro Delhi area alone has 36 million people!). \n\n2. As others have mentioned, be wary of street food as it has a tendency to make anyone sick. Get the oral vaccine for travellers diarrhea if possible before leaving, and take Imodium with you (genuine life saver). \n\n3. Personally, I believe there is A LOT to see in Delhi such as Chandni Chowk, the red fort, lotus temple, India gate etc. However, it is a very overwhelming city so I don\u2019t blame you for skipping it. If you can get a local guide, it can be extremely helpful. \n\n4.  The rest of your itinerary looks great and I agree there isn\u2019t a need to spend more than a day in Agra. \n\n5. It would be good to learn a few basic Hindi words just in case you ever need (\u201cpaani\u201d = water, \u201chaa\u201d = yes, \u201cnahi\u201d = no). The general population can understand a rudimentary level of English and google translate also helps a lot. \n\n6. Get a data plan!!! Service is good throughout most of the country and having wifi access can save you. \n\n7. Nothing is ever \u201cfree\u201d in India. That\u2019s the easiest way to get scammed. Be firm with your no\u2019s. \n\nOverall, I had a trio of a lifetime with my friends and we would do it all again despite some of the challenges we faced. Definitely the most fun I\u2019ve ever had travelling a country. Feel free to PM me if you have any specific questions!",

It's going to be crowded with lots of garbage and noise, but around every corner is a beautiful new adventure you'd never expect.

            "comment": "July really isn't a good time to be in this part of north india. Most of the day is either really hot and humid or pouring. I would suggest colder areas of north india like Uttarakhand or Himachal but those are prone to landslides and consequent road blockages in this season.\n\nI would honestly just go south or west. It will still be rainy ( and humid ) but the temperature is more pleasant. Also the hilly regions here with their lush greenery are a sight to behold in the rain.\nI'd go towards Munnar, Wayanad, Vagamon (Kerala), Ooty, Kodaikanal (Tamil Nadu), Coorg (Karnataka), or Mahabaleshwar, Lonavala (Maharashtra).\n\nBe very well prepared for the rain. I hope you have a great trip",

People target tourists sometimes, just ignore it, don't go out to unknown streets at night. A market place Is fine, but do keep your wallet safe and phone safe.",

            "comment": "I only visited some months ago for two weeks (Delhi, Agra, Jaipur). I clearly have not experienced a lot so my comment comes from ignorance and the limited, completely tourist view I had\u2026but I really didn\u2019t like it. It was just too much \u201cscamming\u201d or generally taking advantage. I like to walk in cities and although it is an experience, walking in New Delhi traffic is hell. Also you get shouted at dozens and dozens of times by rickshaw drivers. This is all expected but it was just the constant repetition and sheer amount of it. Wherever you go people stop you to go in their shops. At the hotel there is always one guy that \u201chelps\u201d you with your daily explorations. At every palace there are tons of guides approaching you. They all talk to themselves in Hindi and you can understand that they are just trying to take as much money as possible. At the end of my trip I would go directly to a police officer and ask how the ticketing system for (insert sightseeing place) worked because everywhere there would be people trying to make you buy the expensive all inclusive guided tour, talking with the ticket officer for you etc. Wherever I walked I would be surrounded by all these \u201chelpful\u201d people basically fighting on who gets to take the tourist for a spin. I also made the mistake to take a normal mid range hotel in Delhi which was abysmal. No hot water, ants everywhere etc. \nAnyways this isn\u2019t really news but again, a lot. Jaipur especially since it\u2019s more touristic, Agra obviously a lot. Delhi less of it being a huge city that lives off other things except tourists. \nIt\u2019s a pity because I became so entrenched by the end that I would act all \u201ccolonial\u201d and just dismiss and walk right through people, even those who genuinely wanted to help like in Agra with two guys. \nAnyways it is a fascinating country. I don\u2019t know where you come from but I think the culture shock is inevitable.",

            "comment": "As others have said, it will be so hot. Some things will be extremely frustrating. Watch out for scams etc. I like Jaipur and the food in Rajasthan is amazing, but you might have a better time in Uttarakhand or Himachal Pradesh (higher elevation, cooler temps). \n\nOne tip I would add because is to get an Indian phone number when you arrive. I made the mistake of trying to use my US phone with an international plan, and had so much trouble with two step verification things, plus things like providing your phone number for bus, train etc. \n\nAlso I heard trains from Delhi book way in advance. I took a bus because of this, there are comfortable AC buses available everywhere pretty much. Public transit is very cheap and frequent but often crowded and hot, if you can afford it upgrade to nicer AC bus/AC car on train.",

            "comment": "As some one who is from India, I must say your concerns are valid. I did see foreigners posting mostly negative experiences about their visit to India and there is some truth to it but you also will have good experiences - just like with any place. \n\nHere's one positive article that might help you. \n\n1. The first thing I would say is don't try to do it completely solo, travel with a group of foreigners. \n2. Don't directly aim to get the \"local\" experience by roaming the streets at night by yourself, eating street food - especially if it's your first time. \n3. Prepare your stomach before hand to handle the spice. I know this is a big complaint for a lot of people who travel and it's perfectly valid. Dine only in 3 star and above restaurants to make sure you won't have food poisoning and specifically tell them to put less spice in everything. \n4. Carry cash around or if you can have a local bank account connect to UPI(our new payment system) - that helps too. I am not sure if this can work, if not just carry around cash. \n5. You will be asked for photographs quite often, expect this and you won't be surprised when it happens. Just be careful with your wallet while going in crowded places. \n6. Traffic - it's chaos. I say get used to it but you really can't. So try to travel in cabs with AC and not Autorickshaws etc, if you want it do it once for the experience - otherwise just Uber. \n\nI can go on, but this is a good start.",

    "postText": "I just got back from a short sightseeing trip to Chicago and unfortunately had a few issues with harassment during the daytime.  I've had minor instances of catcalling here and there when traveling over the years, but never anything I couldn't quickly dismiss.  This trip was different, as I had a few instances mid-day in civilized/popular areas (Michigan Ave for one) where guys yelled derogatory comments as I walked by, and also had a guy who wouldn't stop trying to engage/hitting on me at an afternoon Sox game (shoutout to the awesome group in the row behind me who knew exactly what was up and looked out for me!).  \n\nTo provide some context, I'm a late 20s white female.  I have a very average appearance and am a bit on the heavier side. This past week I was wearing unisex t-shirts, hair in a bun, no makeup.  I give this information not to victim-blame/shame those who dress different by any means (it's the culture that's the problem, not the women), but just to give an idea that in these situations I was pretty nondescript and unsure how to fade into the background more. \n\nI have a pretty severe anxiety disorder, so I tend to always anticipate the worst when traveling and have a strong guard up; that being said, situations like these definitely don't calm my nerves or make me eager to travel more.  **For those who have found themselves in similar situations, have you found anything that relatively helps the issue (like the wedding ring thing)?  How do you calm your nerves and try to move past it, in the event it happens?**\n\nThank you for all input/suggestions!",

I'm not much to look at and usually wear long pants, loose tshirts, never wear makeup, etc, too.  But it's not really about what you look like or wear, it's about their need for power and getting a reaction.\n\nI just ignore ignore ignore.  No eye contact.  No reaction when they catcall.  Deny them the reaction they want.  But remain aware of what's around you and get out of the situation/area as quickly as possible.  Walk away.  And walk with *purpose*.  Don't wander.\n\nIn situations where the harassment gets bad, step into a store or restaurant or someplace supervised where you can find help and witnesses.  I enlisted the help of people behind the counter at a gas station when I was in a particularly threatening situation once.  Usually people will help you.\n\nReally, it's all the same stuff I do at home.  The only difference for traveling is that you should probably make yourself aware of how to get help in a foreign place beforehand.  (ie: how to call the police, how to ask for help in the local language, etc).  Write it down and keep it handy, just in case.",

I walked up to the people a few steps ahead of me (two couples \\~30s) and asked if I could walk with them for a bit because I didn't feel safe.  The husbands were immediately like \"we got you\" and they all walked back with me until we passed my hotel and kept talking to me the whole time.\n\nIt's a funny concept to me that in situations like these, strangers can both cause the issues and sometimes be the best help!",

I have no issue talking to people at a ball game and have had great conversations with people sitting in the seats around me many of times.  At first the guy was being pleasant, nothing alarming, just talking about the game in general.  He had a friend with him who then suddenly went missing for the last few innings, which I'm thinking was intentional (he made some comment at one point about he and the friend driving together, so he didn't leave).  Once the friend was gone, the attempts to engage started to get weird.  The \"are you on Facebook\" was just weird af.  I immediately said \"no\" to shut it down and he said something along the lines of \"you're a different kind of woman\" , which again was concerning.  Had I not had an awesome group of people behind me who were clued in, I would have tried to make as graceful of an exit as possible to avoid any further attempts.  When it started to get really weird was in the final inning, so at that point I thought it would be worse to immediately react and leave (showing I was impacted by it) and just rode out the inning knowing the group behind me had my back.\n\nI totally get where you're coming from with this perspective though, and didn't think anything of it until his questions took a sharp turn.",

Reason is that regular run of the mill clothes makes the crusty men feel like you\u2019re more accessible to them, increasing their chances of hitting on you. Likewise if you dress up then they will know that you are out of their league and they\u2019re less likely to hit. Not completely preventative but it\u2019s helped a few of my friends and I.\n\nSomething that also helps is my mindset to \u201cnever entertain a bitch on the street\u201d and by that I mean that I don\u2019t talk to or engage with strangers, especially if I\u2019m walking on the street. I don\u2019t know them, so I can just walk away. I can briefly acknowledge them, as an \u201cI\u2019m watching you\u201d kinda look, but I just don\u2019t engage. If they don\u2019t understand boundaries never be afraid to tell \u2018em off or tell them to leave you alone.",

Keep the earbuds silent so you can stay aware of your surroundings. The earbuds give you full plausibility to both ignore &amp; start talking as if you\u2019re on a very important business call with a group of people who can hear everything going on. I\u2019ve had friends go as far as using them to record especially egregious or dangerous situations automatically uploaded to the cloud. Bonus: if they are Bluetooth you can use them to call 911.  If I\u2019m going somewhere causal, I just change when I get there (when I was single, I ditched the ring too.) It\u2019s a pain, but honestly anything that makes you seem less accessible &amp; less attractive bait is worth it imo. \nLPT: If a guy is really bothering you, look for a lady who looks like a mom or is 40+ yo &amp; walk up to her. Just start talking as if you know her &amp; motion towards the offender. We will understand &amp; help you. We\u2019ve all been there. This is about power for the guy &amp; he\u2019s not looking to have it questioned by someone\u2019s mom or an \u201cOld lady\u201d. He\u2019ll generally back off.   \nAs for the baseball situation, I\u2019ve found it very helpful, in my youth, to casually work in stories about my brother who is a cop. Funny story, when we were teens he broke the arm of a guy who kept bothering me. I\u2019m in town to see him &amp; he\u2019s picking me up after the game. He\u2019s here for a convention. He just bought a new HK 9 mm. It\u2019s really pretty. I can\u2019t wait to try it out. Every time the creep talked, I\u2019d work in something about my brother &amp; overprotective father who is also a cop. I still use a similar story for when tradesmen come over, only now it\u2019s my youngest brother who is staying with me right now. There are a pair of used tactical work boots in my entryway. I occasionally move them around &amp; set them outside. I have no brothers.",

Looking back, it was probably so she wouldn't be harassed while seeing the sights. The same (pretty young women asking me to accompany them) has happened in several other places like Madrid (she was Brazilian) and London (American). I'm an experienced traveller, friendly but not very gregarious or loud - also over 6 foot tall, dress conservatively (no logos), and definitively over 40y/o. I can say confidently I've never knowingly made a woman feel unsecure or threatened (I can also often be a bit dull, tbh). \n\nNapoli is super aggressive, although as I can easily pass for Italian I fortunately wasn't harassed or intimidated once there. I was in Barca quite a few times by dudes, ha ha, and in Vietnam by hawkers - a withering look goes a long way ;)",

That really built up my confidence and my changed perspective made most harassment just an annoyance. Part of the program was practicing key phrases for common situations in an off-putting tone. I have a very strong \"no\" voice now. When that wasn't enough, I'd generally approach a group of strangers for help. The closest group that feels at all comfortable, I'd just ask \"can I join you for a bit? This guy won't leave me alone.\" No one has ever turned me away. \n\nNow, I'm old and fat though. I almost never get harassed anymore. Lol I do step in when I see similar situations though. Usually just step right between the victim and the harasser, with my back to the harasser, and start a conversation with the victim. Keep their eye contact on me, and loudly cut off the harasser like they don't exist whenever possible. It's nerve racking, but they always walk away after a couple minutes.",

Instead she smacked me in the head with her giant bag on her shoulder and stepped on my feet. Next thing you know she refused to put her mask on. Of course at this time it was a huge deal. The flight attendants were coming by every few seconds to tell the lady to put her mask on. Then the pilot was talking to this woman. This is when I did what I did best\u2026 I went into my dead stare and stared daggers into seat in front of me, clenching my knuckles so they turned white, shaking my leg - I honestly probably looked like I was going to go crazy. I also turned up my music so only she could hear. I saw her look at me for a couple seconds and almost instantly, she just started cooperating, she kept her mask on for the rest of the flight and then passed out snoring. I felt very proud of myself that day to say the least.\n\nI\u2019d never hurt a fly by the way, but I knew if I looked just a little crazy with simple body language, she\u2019d stop protesting.",

Almost every day, some dude would come up to me at the beach, just sit down right next to me and try to chat me up.\n\nBut I never felt threatened. Uneasy - the beach situation - but never threatened. I just ignored every guy on the beach and they disappeared fairly quickly. The catcalls I barely noticed after a while, and even if I did, I paid no attention to it.\n\nI often put in headphones (even if without music - though sometimes I have a fake conversation/pretend to talk to someone), walk fast and determined (even if I have no clue where I'm going), put on my best fuck off face, pay zero attention, by all means never make eye contact, don't even look in that direction, simply drown it all out and 99.9% of the time, that does the trick. Very occasionally, I wear a fake wedding ring, but find that helps extremely little to nothing at all. If they really bug me, I make up a boyfriend or husband who is \"just on the way to join me\".",

I feel like there is a way to sort of exude it through your body too, kind of like a version of \"grey rock\" (this is a tactic for dealing with narcissists, lots of info online but it is basically about making yourself feel very boring) but for the general public. I am in my forties but look like I am in my twenties due to genetics, and too tired since the pandemic started to dress up or wear make up. But generally speaking, and unfortunately, I have noticed I get more attention when I am in a wonderful mood (rare, but it happens) so I have developed a sort of emotionless, nondescript \\*energy\\* which acts as an invisibility cloak when out and about. And it does suck that this is a thing, and it is 2023, and also? I value being able to just get around and do normal things without having my flow interrupted so I feel like it is pragmatic to be like this. \n\n(Mind, this is in my hometown, haven't travelled in a while, so this will be put to the test when I do next month.)",

Guess there's a freedom in that since it doesn't bother me to be invisible. I hope you find some good answers that allow you to be whoever you want to be without having to consider the feelings of strangers. \n\nI am wondering - what is a good way for a guy to try to approach a young woman?  And maybe your question has to do with tips to communicate that you are not interested without escalating.  I know if a stranger asked me if I was on facebook I would have to be direct in letting them know that I wasn't comfortable with them asking giving them a stern/disappointed mom look and tone (and let them know that they have actually made the interaction weird/uncomfortable if they continued to try to engage). \n\nFinally, I saw comments about guys who say \"smile\" to women and how annoying that is (and I do agree (especially because they think it's ok to do to a stranger) but I work with all men and they do it to each other too. Not strangers like with women but there are some guys with resting bitch faces that get told to \"smile\" all of the time too but coworkers that they don't work with directly.",

I lived and worked in downtown Seattle for ages and commuted through some of the worst spots, so I think I just have a really refined \"fuck off\" presentation when I want to. Blasting bass music in big obvious headphones, will literally punch through a gaggle of hooligans if they're blocking the door I'm coming out of (literally. The exit from my old office onto 3rd Ave always had a hoard of high homeless people blocking it and I'd just kick the door open to startle them and they'd scatter for me long enough to blast through toward the subway with my \"I'm commuting and today is a good day to die\" energy, lmao).\n\n\nGranted, this isn't so effective at night if you need to be able to hear your surroundings better. In those instances I just keep walking, and if they wanna get loud, I will get loud and channel my inner city ghoul (very New England style tbh).\n\n\nGenerally if someone is catcalling I ignore it, if someone gives me a compliment (tactless or not) I'll give them a simple friendly \"Thanks!\" without breaking pace / stopping for them, and if they follow me I'll start walking an absurd path so they are either forced to admit what they're doing OR don't know what to do with it and stop. On occasion I've yelled \"IN A HURRY, I SHIT MY PANTS, IT WASN'T A FART\" or some other ridiculous gross statement (you can get super creative, I find it hilarious) that will stop most people dead in their tracks. Either that or just start barking at them. Literally nobody knows wtf to do with that. The theme is if you present yourself as crazier than them, they tend to fuck off.\n\n\nBy far the best way I've avoided it overall, though, is just simply dressing like a fuckin bag lady and wearing a face mask (thank you covid!) because I can shift between a visually appealing woman and someone who may or may not eat children. Basket Woman version of me gets ignored and it's fantastic. Appealing me gets a lot of attention and there's a specific time and place where I'm in the mood for that.",

I don't know if a wedding ring works but it's worth a try. Mentioning your boyfriend or husband being asleep at the hotel or on his way or something might help. It depends on the situation. There is no way to stop men from being that way. You have to figure out what you can do to feel safe. Staying home isn't the thing to do. Just read up on advice, figure out what you are comfortable with, and plan. If you can find a church or school group to tag along with, that can help. Or when you travel seek out a group doing the same thing you want to do, like on meetup or at some other site that helps organize people. Being with a group can minimize the trouble but of course, there is bound to be someone in the group too.",

            "comment": "I'm a male, so take this advice however you want. \n\nI often get asked to look at something or just endlessly harassed to buy things. \n\nThe most simple trick to get rid of this type of attention is to wear headphones, have a purpose, and be okay with ignoring people.\n\nHeadphones can either be on or not up to you. I mix it up if I want a soundtrack of the day, I'll play some tunes. If I'm feeling a bit skeptical of the area, then they're off and are just aesthetic. People won't know they are off and assume you're listening to something and leave you alone.\n\nHave a purpose. With this, I mean don't look like you're lost or contemplating things. This gives people a window to swoop in and interact with you. If you look like you know what you're doing most of the time, there's no reason to approach you.\n\nBe okay ignoring people. I really hate to dismiss people and find it very disrespectful. So I have to tell myself it's okay to ignore someone if it's for your own well-being. If for some reason there is someone I ignored and it ends up that I do need to interact with them, I play dumn and apologize and move on with conversation.\n\nHope this helps, and if someone knows how to improve these, I'd like to know.",

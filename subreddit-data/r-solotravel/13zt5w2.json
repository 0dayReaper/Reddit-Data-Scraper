            "comment": "Japan is very safe. You will be fine to be walking around at night/early morning. I think you are doing a lot of travelling around and you\u2019ll likely be exhausted at the end, but I think this would work. Have you looked at how long each train trip will be and taken into account the number of hours that will take out of your day? It looks like you are planning to visit an onsen in beppu. It might be good to research onsen etiquette before you go. In my experience, locals get quite upset if you don\u2019t wash appropriately before you get in etc.",

So long as I don't get lost in the trains for long, I should be able to get to the first destination early enough to take good pictures and explore without too much crowd yet. Thanks for the onsen etiquette reminder. It would also be a first for me and I look forward to that.",

I personally spent 7 days between Fukuoka and Nagasaki when I went. Are you taking public transport or renting a car? I would stay in Fukuoka on day 0 , get on the earliest train to Beppu the next day, spend the day there and get on the latest bus to Yufuin. From there pick, Saga or Kumamoto. I think Nagasaki should have two days. Instead of Huis Ten Bosch, check out Dejima and Inasayama unless you're a huge theme park person.",

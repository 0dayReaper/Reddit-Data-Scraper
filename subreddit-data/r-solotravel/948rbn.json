All entry fees are included and your visa fee is waived (if you stay 3+ nights). \n\nI heard Petra By Night was overrated. It's the Treasury list up with candles and some dances/stories by the Bedouin people. I think  you would appreciate an extra day in Petra (as opposed to night), as the entire complex is massive. Exploring off the main trail is one of the best parts!",

I'm only spending three days here (2 Petra, 1 Wadi Rum) due to scheduling so I've only seen the tip!\n\nBut some thoughts: \n\n* As a Canadian, Jordan is expensive. The exchange is 1 CAD to just 0.5 JOD so even a 5 JOD meal turns out to be fairly expensive by our standards. A typical shawarma meal costs around that here.\n\n* Southern Jordan is very much like Arizona/Utah in terms of scenery. The entire place is desert (not the sandy type, but the red rock canyon type).\n\n* Jordanians are friendly but forthright. They're not afraid to tell you their thoughts on things but don't mean to offend, that's just how they're brought up.\n\n* Wadi Rum *looks* amazing. It is a desert region between Aqaba (where I drove in from) and Petra which I drove by on my way to Petra. Excited to spend tomorrow night there in a Bedouin camp!\n\n* Walking through the border from Israel is easy, especially with the Jordan Pass. Pay Israeli exit fee, go through customs in both countries, and you're done!",

So I impulse booked and spent a week in Israel and am now in Jordan. This region of the world is so damn far from my hometown (Canada) that I just had to do it while I was here! I'll be flying to Poland in a few days to continue on with the Eastern Europe plan. 1.5 months of travel in total!\n\nMy entire trip has been:\n\n* Tour du Mont Blanc (trekking Alps through France, Italy, Switzerland)\n* Milan &amp; Cinque Terre, Italy\n* Budapest, Hungary\n* Tel Aviv, Jerusalem &amp; Dead Sea, Israel\n* Petra &amp; Wadi Rum, Jordan\n* Wroclaw &amp; hopefully Krakow, Poland\n* Who knows where next?",

In Rome and some of Italy's other more touristy cities I saw people running the 'bracelet scam' where they introduce themselves all friendly, offer you a 'free' bracelet,' tie it on to you, and then demand money for it once it's attached to you. But if you just ignore when they try to talk to you they'll move on.",

                            "comment": "It really depends on context, but sadly in many of the highly touristed cities a lot of scammers don't walk up and say, \"Hey want to buy something from me?\" They walk up and say, \"Hi, where are you from, oh my cousin lives there, how's your trip going, bla bla bla,\" and then it turns into a sales pitch eventually, or a tour that ends in a shop where you get a very aggressive sales pitch. \n\nSo yeah, I don't say \"no thanks\" when a stranger walks up in the street and tries to start a conversation, I'll give a polite nod and just keep walking. Or if it's in a place where scammers are more aggressive I'll skip the nod. Again depends on context.\n\nExceptions to this rule are places where tourists legimately are very rare, and people who live there are genuinely curious about what a tourist is doing there. But in Rome, one of the most, if not the most highly touristed cities in the world, I'd be surprised if anyone local has enough burning curiosity about tourists to randomly approach a tourist in the street and strike up a friendly chat. People who live there and don't have ulterior motives are too busy going about their lives to bother trying to approach random strangers in the street for no reason, I imagine.",

The idea is that once they see you're no fool and not an easy mark, they won't waste their time on you and will move onto someone who is. In some countries, their last-ditch attempt to force you to engage will be to call you racist - resist the urge to offer a rebuttal to that and continue to ignore them. \n\nCompletely ignoring them is basically a way to signal that you're wise to what they're up to, so they move on to the next mark after a couple unrequited attempts to get your attention.",

Related to that is NEVER OFFER money to strangers\n2. The most common nuisance in the Imperial Forum area are those African wristband weirdos. They will be friendly, they may even throw their wristbands at you and prey on human instinct to catch them, Ignore them! or give them a firm \"Non, Grazie!\" And do not engage in any conversation with them. I know this is the solo travel subreddit but they especially love to prey on innocent children, travelling with their families. They will hand many of these wristbands to children and immediately prey on the parents for money.\n3. Never accept tickets or offers for tours \"off the street\". Only accept tickets from the official ticket offices themselves or book off the museums' official websites. This rule applies to train travel in Italy as well.\n4. ~~As has been said before. Ignore those centurion or gladiator clad folks, they also want your money.~~  The Gladiators and Centurions have been officially outlawed, thanks for the update. I had heard about em for years.\n5. Pasta dishes should never cost 20EUR, these restaurants are tourist traps and don't even serve quality Italian cuisine. Restaurants usually post the menus on the outside. Never seen one that was a true scam, but some really do overcharge for sure. Check the google reviews before consuming at any establishment, be suspicious of reviews from accounts with relatively few reviews. Fake positive reviews do exist.\n\nHope that helped friend, safe travels!",

            "comment": "Rome is pretty bad for scams and shit like pickpocketing, probably in the top five European cities for scammy-ness.\n\nWith that said, you can mitigate it with some fairly simple precautions.\n\n* The most important measure is to ignore anyone who approaches you. You can't be scammed if you don't engage. Almost invariably, anyone approaching you unsolicited will have an ulterior motive that involves parting you from your money or belongings. When I say ignore, I'm talking a **full-on** ignore - no acknowledgement, no eye contact, no retort if they call you racist etc. Activate resting bitch-face, quicken your pace and move past them briskly. Sunglasses and cheap earbuds help if you're so inclined. Most scammers prey on people's ingrained urge to not appear \"rude\" - you have to overcome the urge to be friendly if you want to avoid falling victim to scammers. It feels unnatural and a bit shady, but it's a necessary evil\n* Try to avoid looking like an oblivious tourist (I say oblivious since it's usually difficult to wholesale disguise the fact you're not a local). Don't stand in the middle of a highly-trafficked area gawking at a map, for example. The more confused you look, the more likely you'll have scammers zero in on you.\n* Not so much scams, but pickpockets (the two usually go hand-in-hand - where there's a prevalence of one, there's a prevalence of the other): a money belt is the best defence against pickpockets. Keep only low-value, daily spending cash distributed across your pockets. IDs/credit cards etc/high-value notes go in the money belt. Hell, I even put my phone in my money belt and use my smart watch for basic navigation/checking messages.\n* At little spatial awareness goes a long way - be mindful of people that suddenly change their course to intercept you and quicken/change your own pace to compensate. Be aware of areas where a phone-snatching could easily occur and don't flash it etc.",

They might say that you \"have\" to pay for their tableside music, for a bracelet, for a donation that you already signed (when you thought it's just a support petition). Tell them if they feel cheated you should all go together to the police, and watch them lose interest. Don't be guilt-tripped into anything you don't want to do.",

Another place tried to do the same for gelato and when we told them we just wanted it to go, as many people were doing, they got annoyed with us and started to become rude. These were super touristy areas though. Most places were fine so don't let that dissuade you from eating out.  But be wary of polite staff offering you a seat if you don't intend to dine in!\n\n[The popup on this site is annoying but it's the most comprehensive list of scams I could find.](https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/avoid-travel-scams/)\n\nAs others are saying, anytime someone tries to hand you something in the streets, don't assume it's free, don't take it, just ignore them.",

The guy wasn't pushy and was in fact very charming, which I'm sure helps him - basically started chatting with me in English, tried to put a bracelet on my wrist, I said no thanks, he moved on. It was pretty low stress and he wasn't aggressive. Best advice is just to say no thank you any time a stranger approaches you on the street. \n\nI personally didn't have any other issues or concerns, and I felt safe walking around/taking the metro/etc.",

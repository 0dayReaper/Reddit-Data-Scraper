    "postText": "It was amazing.  \nSpent 9 days in Cusco, Peru. NYC - Lima - Cusco. It took 20 hours to get there. (Overnight flights etc).  \nArrived in the morning on at 8AM, and spend few hours in the city.   \nDay 1. Checked at hotel (\\~22$) around 10am and got sick because of attitude. Just stayed in hotel.  \nDay 2. Was fine, explored city. Booked Salkantay trek from Machu Picchu R for next day. Chill in city, eat etc.  \nDay 3-7. Salkantay Trek. 5 days. Last day Machu Picchu. Day 8 came back to City at 9PM.  \nDay 8. After long trek, just one day rest. Eating, exploring city + booked next day tour to Rainbow Mountain.  \nDay 9. Rainbow Mountain tour 5AM - 4PM.   \nDay 10. Flight back from Cusco - Lima - Miami - NYC. 3 different flights, about 24 hours.\n\nSpent: \\~ $520 for flights from NYC to Cusco, including local flight.   \nSalkantay trek \\~$275, Rainbow Mountain \\~$30. Hotel \\~$95 for 5 nights. Lost couple $ on commision, paid with credit card instead of cash. Breakfast was included and tea/coffee available 24hr/day.   \nFood was so cheap. Meal up to 20 soles. Probably $30. On salkantay trek it was included.   \nTotal budget $950-970.  \n\n\nWhat I don't like it that in Cusco is cold during this time of the year. At night it was like 5-8C. And since I dont speak spanish it was hard to go around/ask questions.",

Probs like 10k total people through the whole area and 10-15% of that being hippy foreigners.\n\nAlso, with the wolf totem, would not recommend. The guy who owns it is an ass (according to multiple people). Explicitly says he hates hippies, some guy called him \"bro\" or some shit and the guy responded that calling him bro was akin to him sexually assaulting him or some shit.\n\nOfc, this is all just what I heard and it might not be true.\n\nWould recommend la chakana below it. That's where I stayed. Not a hostel but like 6 privates. But yeah, really good vibes, kinda cheap and the guy who runs it is super fucking nice",

The price really depends on many things, mostly the type of accomodations, duration, route/activities and of course the type of machu picchu ticket that's included.

They provide ($10) 3 season sleeping bag. (For me it was not enough, I slept in warm jacket and pants...)  Starting 2nd day nights, it become very warm. We went downhill and lower attitude. It was great.   \nI was hiking with long sleeve polo + Warm fleece. + wind proof jacket on top of Salkantay mountain at early morning first and second day.",

I'm planning on heading to Peru and doing the same Cusco leg you did in the middle out in October. \n\nJust a quick question - how heavy was your bag and did you take the whole thing with you on the trek? I have seen some list you can have a pack animal carry some and you carry a portion but wasn't sure if that was everything or if you left some back in Cusco or what the options were. \n\nSorry if that is confusing but I haven't been able to find information and would love any info you have!",

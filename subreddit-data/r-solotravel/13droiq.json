    "postText": "Hey, I am planning my around the world trip currently and one thing that has stuck with me for a long time is the Banff National Park. However, I have never had any experiences solo traveling nor have I been to Canada.\n\nIf you have answers for some of my questions I would highly appreciate it. \n\n1. Is 1 week enough in Canada? I'd some to do outdoor activities. Hiking, canoeing etc..\n2. What would the average cost for a week be? I eat usually 3 big meals per day. I don't plan to live in a dirt poor hotel, but lower mid range hotel is OK. I plan to do activities such as hiking and canoeing among other touristy things. I would not be spending money on clothes but perhaps an item or two as a memory.\n3. Where is an option to live if I would like to visit Banff National Park? Should I live far away and take a 1 day trip to see this or is 1 day not enough? If I live closeby, will there still be stuff for me to experience other than the Banff Park?\n4. Is there some other things I should think about?\n\nThank you.",

You could easily spend a month exploring each province and only scratch the surface of each. Give your self enough time to drive and slow down unless you want to be pounding the pavement the whole time, plan to drive leisurely so you have time to stop and enjoy the scenery. \n\n1 week isn\u2019t enough.    \n\nLiving costs for a week will vary greatly, if you\u2019re going out for every meal you can expect to spend 20$ per meal on breakfast/lunch dinner will be +30$  \n\nIf you buy/bring camping gear you can really reduce the dollar per day expenses depending on your comfort/skill level.  A tent/gear would open up a bunch of 1-2 night adventures, you\u2019ll end up in places that aren\u2019t over run by day trippers. \n\nCanmore is a good option if you\u2019re wanting to visit Banff and pay less for accommodation.   What season are you planning for your visit?  \nAre you only wanting to visit Banff?",

I am not an experienced solo traveler so I think I would settle for the expensive food and accommodation for the sake of my own safety hehe. But who knows, I won't know unless I try. \n\nThank you for suggesting Canmore, is there a bus that goes between these places or should I rent a car for this? \n\nI am planning to visit in August/September, is the weather still fine by then?",

You could save a few bucks making your own simple lunch/ breakfast, but it won\u2019t make/break your trip.   \nI did a google search, looks like there\u2019s a shuttle option into Banff from Canmore and there\u2019s public transit. Canmore has hikes and nature too if you want a break from a daily shuttle",

            "comment": "Banff National Park is in AB and the easiest way to get there is through Calgary. A week is enough but you'd probably only be able to see Banff and maybe one more city. Food is quite expensive, especially if you're in Banff. People say Scandinavia is expensive but we're probably just as pricey. If your main thing is Banff, I'd stay in Canmore, its a 15 minute drive away and accommodation should be cheaper. I hope you're already planning to get a car which means you'll need to account for gas prices which are pretty high these days.   \n\n\nIf you come between March and September, you need to keep an eye on wildfires too. You should account for the national park fees too.",

    "postText": "Hello fellow redditors! 27 year old travel-hungry swede here. Romania and especially Transsylvania has now caught my eye for a solo-trip, a place I've never been before. As a history and nature geek, it feels like a must-visit place for me. I like to mix major must-see places with smaller \"off the beaten path\" gems on my travels. I'm gonna do mostly hostels to keep the costs down, but other than that I don't plan to travel on a  a ultra-light budget.\nI plan to do my transportation by bus/trains (I've used Rome2Rio as a source for the schedules) I haven't booked any tickets yet so the travel plan is still very much up for change. I'm thinking about going in early July, and I plan to fly down to Bucharest and then fly back home from Budapest (I've already visited Budapest, so it's not the focus of this trip).\n\nAfter reading up a bit, I've  come up with a rough travel plan:\n\nDay 1: Bucharest, wandering around and seeing the main sights. (Old town, parliament, Ceasescu's villa, the open air folk museum etc).\n\nDay 2: Early travel to Brasov, with one quick stop in Sinaia to se Peles Castle (Not decided yet whether I'll go inside). The rest of the day will be spent in Brasov, maybe with a quick trip to Rasnov later in the evening if I have time.\n\nDay 3: Bran Castle early in the day, even though it feels pretty tourist trap-ish I probably want to include it. Then I'm thinking to spend some time hiking around Pestera etc, either by catching the bus to  Moieciu de Jos and walking from there, or by hiking from Brasov. Then catching the bus back to Brasov afterwards (according to rome2rio, there's buses going back until 10 pm). \n\nDay 4: Thinking about taking this tour to see Sighisoara, Rupea and Viscri all in one day: https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g295394-d11457142-Small_Group_Tour_Sighisoara_Rupea_Fortress_and_Viscri_Day_Trip_from_Brasov-Brasov_.html \nAfter the trip, I'm thinking about taking the late train to Sibiu (departing at 9pm from Brasov according to rome2rio)\n\nDay 5: This day I'm thinking about taking this tour from Sibiu to see Sarmisegetuza Regia https://sibiutourguide.com/sarmisegetuza-trip-guide.html\nThe tour is a bit pricey for one solo person, but Sarmisegetuza Regia feels like a must-visit place for a history/archeology geek like me. I'm thinking about asking to also include Corvin Castle and Alba Iulia in the tour.\n\nDay 6: Now I'll be traveling early in the morning to Cluj Napoca and seeing the town. I've read that you don't need much time there, so maybe I'll continue to Oradea late in the evening.\n\nDay 7: Last day! Now I'll take the early bus from Oradea to Budapest, and later in the day fly home.\n\nAdd-ons I've thought of:\nDo a day trip to Maramures. It would be cool to spend some time in Maramuers as well and see some of the sights. However, from what I can tell it seems pretty hard to do through a day trip, as most of the main sights is pretty way out in the country and hard to reach by public transportation. I was looking for some day trip-tours from Cluj, but the few ones I found was a bit too pricey for me (+400 dollars a day..). Any addvice of any reachable town from Cluj or Sighisoara in Maramures worth visiting? I was looking up Baia Mares, but I'm not sure if it's worth the trip..\n\nOther places I've thought of but haven't included (yet): Turda Salt mines. Don't get me wrong, it seems like a cool place but I'm not sure how worth it it'll be for a solo-traveller like me.. Seems like more of a family/couple destination.\n\nSo yeah, as I said, this is just a rough sketch of my travel plans. I feel that a week-ish is roughly how long I feel like I'll want to spend on this trip, but I can absolutely add a day or two if you think it's necessary for any must see-sights. All input is appreciated, everything from whether my travel plan seems do-able, major travel advice to tips of unknown gems to see, and restaurants and pubs that I must not miss on my journey :)",

I find its information often bears no resemblance to reality.\n\nI enjoyed the Turda Salt Mine as a solo traveler. You can combine it with a short hike in the Cheile Turzii national park, but would have to take a taxi as there isn't really a public transport route.",

There are daily buses on the route but with all the stops they make on the way it will take a full day to travel and see some places.\n\nBetter to focus on Sinaia,Sighisoara, Corvin Castle on the way to Sarmizegetusa. Don\u2019t know if you can do a day tour from Cluj to Sarmizegetusa as there is some distance. The trains run slow but you can check timetables for all Europe on bahn.de",

Or maybe stick to Moisei, it has a old wooden church and monastery too and after this village is Borsa, where you can do a short hike to a pretty waterfall and enjoy the mountain sights.  DM me for bus recommendations if you want otherwise I\u2019ll forget to look for them in my notes",

I was fortunate enough to book a tour which went to a Peles first and Bran Castle second so I wasn't as dissapointed in the entire day trip as Peles Castle was actually quite good!\n\nEveryone has different taste though :)",

What gives??\n\n\nI started looking at accommodation in Rome for the next leg of my trip and hostels are avg 100 euro!! \n\nIs this normal? \nOr are there some events happening in Rome next week? \n(asking since I can understand Barcelona prices were higher due to F1 and primavera)",

I spent a month travelling Spain during January/February, which is supposed to be the off-season. I spent a week in BCN, averaging slightly under 20 euros per night on weekdays, which is a reasonable figure. In Madrid that was closer to 30. Around the weekend it could get excessive in both cities, with hostels being fully booked and ridiculous prices. In BCN it was still fine when I was there (bare in mind this was january) with weekend prices being around 40-50, but in Madrid the first time I was there prices were between 40-80 per night and the second time I was there it good even crazier (this was around carnival weekend). On Saturday night I saw dorms going for around 160 euros, and those were the \"shittier\" ones that weren't booked yet.",

You're not supposed to be performing work in a foreign country on a tourist visa. Second, it runs counter to the intent of teleworking. If you're earning a full salary, you shouldn't be able to answer a few emails and spend only a few hours actually working while lazing around the rest of the day. \n\nIn my industry I see this all the time, where the quality of work of those who telework has significantly dropped, and there are barking dogs or crying babies in the background during conference calls or projects take twice as long because the group dynamic is impossible over a zoom call. \n\nJust look at Mexico City as one example. Rents and lodging are through the roof from all the Americans who've moved there to telework. They earn U.S. salaries with all the advantages of low cost of living Mexican expenses. It's making it very difficult to get by for the locals who can't afford to live in their own cities anymore. \n\nAnd it's not because \"hotels closed during covid\" or \"revenge travel\". It's from the teleworkers, and we're seeing the same thing across major tourist cities around the world.",

I had a fucking amazing time, 6 weeks hostel hopping around Central/Eastern Europe at 21 years old. None of the places were even terrible. Apart from Slovakia where I was in a dorm with an English stag party, but the conditions themselves were good, much better than 7 euros worth.",

And sometimes even hotels are cheaper.\n\nI'm traveling soon to Amsterdam (but in this case not solo but with my hubby), and I was checking for prices. I found a hostel which would have charged 50 EUR per person in a 32 bed dorm, lol. Then I did more research and a 4-star hotel in Zaandam, just 10 mins. by train from Amsterdam, is about 90 EUR per night for the two of us, so already cheaper than the hostel.",

If you're travelling with others it's even easier - splitting a hotel room is almost guaranteed to be cheaper than staying in two dorm beds in Europe now.",

In Vienna and Berlin I even booked a hotel because the hostel prices were almost as expensive as a private hotel room \ud83d\ude36",

Judging by the fact that you're posting this on a Saturday (where I am anyway), you're probably looking to book for the beginning of next week, likely a Sunday night into Monday. Correct me if I'm wrong, though.\n\nAs for Rome's prices, it's one of the most popular travel destinations in the world, as others have said.",

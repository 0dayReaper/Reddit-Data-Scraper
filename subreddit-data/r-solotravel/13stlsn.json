Solo means you\u2019re designing the experience for yourself based around your own ideas and preferences, the amount of social activity is just one variable to consider during trip planning. \n\nI think many of us get into solo traveling because it\u2019s not great to have to conform to others expectations when we\u2019re investing limited  time off and money into travel, so why should anyone conform to others ideas of how social a trip should or shouldn\u2019t be?",

Worried that I won\u2019t make any friends or will always be alone because of social anxiety.  \n\nNow I\u2019ll be honest you will occasionally have bad days when solo traveling. I think everyone does. However many days you\u2019ll be having the best time ever and seeing lots of cool and interesting things or maybe even making new friends!\n\nA great piece of advice I read which has really helped me is to not focus on traveling as a way to make friends but to focus on just enjoying traveling even if that\u2019s doing things by yourself. That way you\u2019ll still meet people but you won\u2019t be putting pressure on yourself to constantly make friends by treating it as the main focus of your trip. \n\nSomething else that really helped me was booking on a small group tour to begin with. It was very scary at first but as you\u2019re basically forced to do activities as a group you kind of just end up socialising with people. Obviously the success of this can depend on the group but I\u2019ve found the vast majority of people who are solo traveling are really friendly and open to meeting new people :)",

I think its always holding in mind the broader arch of how things are going. There's been lots of places I haven't met anyone - and the first few weeks were tricky. But now I've accumulated a bit more time - I've met enough nice people on occasions its been a really positive collection to hold onto if that makes sense. It means even you don't meet people, it feels like chance, not a personal affront. And also takes the pressure off the times when you don't meet anyone - its the pressure that gets in the way of enjoying being alone for me. So now I have the best of both worlds. Sometimes meet nice people but almost more importantly feel ok when i dont. I don't think travelling is necessarily profound but the collection of nice people I've met - and I suppose more importantly that have appeared to like me back -  will likely have a lasting impact. Just go for it I think",

You might go sightseeing with some people, but more times the not, you will probably be alone. Of course you might meet someone you clique with where your travel plans align for weeks or sometimes months and you travel with each other, but that is pretty rare. I\u2019ve only had one instance of that happening in Southeast Asia a couple years ago and the guy is an old friend now. \n\nAt the end of the day solo traveling for most people is about you and what you make of it. If you want to see the sites and travel the world there you go. If you want to party with strangers for a few days and meet a ton of people who you will probably never see again after you or them move on, there\u2019s a scene for that too. The memories you make doing whatever you want to do are most valuable. \n\nBackpackers are also some of the nicest and most receptive people I\u2019ve been around as well, just for a final point.",

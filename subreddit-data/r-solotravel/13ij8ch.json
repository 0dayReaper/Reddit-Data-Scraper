    "postText": "Hi all, I am planning to spend roughly 2 months in ASIA. It's my first trip outside of Europe, but not the first time doing solotravel. I've been to a lot of countries from Europe and I had a lot of fun.\n\n**My plan is:**\n\n* **Indonesia - 6 days \\[11 - 16 nov\\]**\n\n\\- Bali (relaxare, soare) - 3 days\n\n\\-  Jakarta - 3 days\n\n**Singapore - 3 days \\[16 - 19 nov\\]**\n\n**Malaysia - 7 days \\[19 nov - 25 nov\\]**\n\n\\- Kuala Lumpur (3 days)\n\n\\- Tioman Islands (2 day)\n\n\\- Pengan (2 days)\n\n**Vietnam - 7 days \\[ 25 nov - 1 dec\\]**\n\n\\- Hanoi &amp; HaLong bay (5 days)\n\n\\- H\u1ed9i An (2 days)\n\n**Cambodia  - 7 days \\[1 dec - 7 dec\\]**\n\n\\- Siem Reap (4 days)\n\n\\- Angkor wat (3 days)\n\n**Thailand - 14 days \\[ 7dec - 28dec\\]**\n\n\\- Bangkok 4 days\n\n\\- Phuket   3 days\n\n\\- Chiang Mai 3 days\n\n\\- KohSamui/KohTao/KohRong(4 days)\n\n**Japan - 6 days \\[ 28 dec 2023 - 02 ian 2024\\]**\n\n**\u2014---------------------**\n\n**Total: 50 days**\n\nAbout me:I'm 25M and I would like a mix of doing things, seeing places and having a chill time. In Thailand I would like to also learn surfing so this is the reason I added more days.I will stay in hostels because I love meeting new people. I like to party a lot, but not for 50 days so it will be a mix of chill days and crazy places.\n\nLet me know what do you think. Also, what budget would you find decent ? (no 5 stars hotels and no first class plane tickets, but enough to eat a meal out every day, have drinks and do some activites, such as surfing or scuba diving).",

My one big critique of this itinerary would be that it doesn\u2019t leave time for a particularly immersive experience in each country but maybe that\u2019s fine for you as you\u2019re more of a \u201ctick that one off the list\u201d type of traveller (nothing wrong with that!).\n\nTo me your itinerary reads a bit like a europe one and I will say getting around SEA is not quite like getting around Europe.\n\n\u20186 days in Japan\u2019 is not very specific as Japan has a lot of different cities/towns. Realistically, with 6 days you could probably only do one city (either Tokyo, Kyoto, or Osaka) and use the city as a base to do some day trips OR two cities with 3 days each, but 3 days per city is really not enough especially when you factor in travel time. I spent a week in Tokyo and never ran out of things to do (but I\u2019m a slower style traveller).\n\nI\u2019m currently near the end of 2 weeks in Cambodia and I\u2019ve been able to see a lot of the country (albeit quicker than I normally would). Siem Reap would be the main place I would come back to here so it\u2019s a good choice if you\u2019re only going to one destination in Cambodia but you won\u2019t really see or experience much of the everyday life and culture of the Cambodian people if you only visit Siem Reap. As others have said, Angkor Wat is basically in Siem Reap, it\u2019s about a 30 min tuktuk ride (I think) from the city. You could do 4 days Siem Reap split between experiencing the city and visiting the temples in Angkor Wat. I\u2019d recommend trying to make time (2 days is doable) to visit Phnom Penh and see S21 and the killing fields as this is a really important part of Cambodian history and the effect of the Khmer Rouge regime is still significantly impacting the country and its people today. Anyone older than 50 here actually lived through the regime and most younger people lost family members or are closely related to survivors of the Khmer Rouge. I also really liked Kratie, Kampong Cham or Kampot for more in-depth/broader experience of daily Cambodian life but maybe not feasible with your timeframe.\n\nYou\u2019ve listed Koh Rong as an island in Thailand but Koh Rong is in Cambodia. Actually on my way there today! :)\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I visited Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia so I don\u2019t have much input there sorry. Haven\u2019t been to Vietnam but it\u2019s on my list!",

KL to Tioman is pretty much a full day, so if you only plan to spend 2 days there, meaning one full day, you will not have much time to actually see things. Skip Phuket entirely and add it in to Koh Tao. Skip Jakarta as time is better spent seeing more of Bali, rather than just a big city with lots of traffic and not much tourist things to do.\n\nIf you don't have a great budget, drop Japan and add time in SE Asia. It is peak travel time  so flights will be expensive. It will be colder there, so you will need to pack more jackets and pants and carry them for 45days in SE Asia.. You really are not having enough time to see much so leave Japan for another time. Good luck.",

Japan for example will be sweater and jacket time in Dec. whereas in Thailand you can walk around in a t-shirt all the time.  I've been to all these destinations except for indonesia, based on how you describe yourself I would remove entirely and allocate those days to Vietnam and Japan.  If you are a water person, also consider getting your PADI scuba license.  It's competitively one of the cheapest places to get your license and only takes about 3 days to get (half day each day).  I would even contemplate removing Singapore and leaving it for a future trip.  If I were your age again, I would do Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Japan.  These four destinations have huge nightlife, variations of sights and sounds, and endless things to see/do.  Japan will be eye awaking in terms of language barrier, so expect a major hurdle (there is no other country I have visited that's first world where english is not common like Japan).",

Bali alone deserves a week (split across the highlands and the coast), and you could use another week to explore another island (Java for history and culture is a good starting point, there's also great hiking to be had around the volcanoes). Jakarta is overlooked and has some fun clubs, interesting neighbourhoods, and great food, but even then I'd say 3 days there is a bit of an overkill. 3 days in Bali, however, is criminally little. \n\nSingapore is a great city with lots of interesting local culture and excellent food, but do keep in mind that it's relatively expensive. \n\nMalaysia is honestly my least favourite Southeast Asian country. I still liked it, but I feel it's second best on most counts - want a great city experience, head to Singapore or Bangkok; want prettier islands, go anywhere in Indonesia / Thailand / the Philippines. That said, Penang's George Town area is very lovely and is worth a few days. I'd also look into the possibility of hiking in Sarawak and Sabah - it's more accessible than rainforest / highland hiking in Indonesia. \n\n\rI have not been to Vietnam or Cambodia, so will not comment on either.\n\nIn Thailand, 2 weeks is a good time BUT I would just pick any one island/beach area instead of trying to do both, the Andaman and the Gulf Coasts. In general, the Phuket / Krabi area has the more scenic landscape with lots of limestone cliffs, while the Koh Samui region has better waters and swimming even if the beaches look a little more generic. Pick just one and give the place more justice, you really won't be missing out on much by skipping the other. \n\nHaven't been to Japan either, so no comments on that. \n\nThe only other place I'd ask you to consider is Luang Prabang in Laos (possibly at the expense of Chiang Mai). It's a lovely old town with scenic countryside, and still has a bit of an old-world charm left, as opposed to pretty modern and touristy Chiang Mai (it's still a lovely place, but not as characterful as it once was). \n\nIf I had 2 months, I'd basically spend 2 weeks apiece in Indonesia (split across Java, Bali, and Komodo - fast paced but doable), Thailand (Bangkok with the Andaman Sea coast - Krabi, Phuket, Khao Lak, Koh Lanta etc.), and Vietnam (Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City via Ha Long, Hoi An, and Nha Trang). The remaining two weeks I'd split across Laos and Cambodia, focusing mostly on Luang Prabang and Vang Vieng in the former, and Siem Reap in the latter. If I still have a few days to spare, I'd use them in Singapore.",

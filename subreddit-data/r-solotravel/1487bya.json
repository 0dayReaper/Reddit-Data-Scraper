Getting into accounts, buying stuff and having it delivered a day later, getting new debit cards and other basic necessities are much harder now.",

You would never comprehend the crippling fear of \u201cwhat if I can\u2019t do good enough at school to go abroad and be stuck here for the rest of my life, working an inhumanely underpaid job with a worthless degree?\u201d \n\nIf you have a solid plan to move to Vietnam, I would encourage you to because by all means it is a beautiful country. I don\u2019t judge anyone for moving anywhere. On the other hand, just from my experience as a native, I would never go back to live there.",

Take some supplements for vitamin D.\n\nThe ease to for bonds with people. Go to the r/switzerland sub. The most asked question is why it's so difficult to make friends. In Germany people are similar to swiss and it's difficult to form friendships. Forget about having simple normal relationships like a vecinita, do\u00f1a de la tienda or even the friendly perros callejeros. Life can be lonely here and many people find it difficult to make friends.\n\nThere's many positive things that outweigh the fact that I love Ecuador and make me stay in Switzerland, like the security, cleanliness, the salary and the fact that everything works perfectly here.

That said, everyone's different, I have several friends who emigrated and miss their country, for instance many of them are complaining about the weather, lack of sun in winter, which for me it's not a problem at all. I reckon one of the main reason I don't miss Italy is I chose to move here, (if I wanted i could have stayed there with a steady job), while many people emigrate because of necessity. \nI also spent one year in Bali, which was an amazing place, but after several months I started missing London. The main reason was the weather, I cannot stand humid warm weather all year round, as I said everyone's different.\nIf I can give you an advice, once you move there, give it some time. Moving to a different country can be challenging at first, but without even realising it you'll get used to it and you might even like it more than your own country. Good luck",

Main things were bacon, cheese, and a condiment I've never seen in any other nation - salad cream!\n\nMost fellow expats I know went through a slump in the 2 to 4 month mark - where the initial excitement wears off, and then you begin to get annoyed by everything that isn't the same as home! But then either you leave, or learn to deal with it and move on (which in my experience, the majority do).\n\nLanguage can be a headache if you're not fluent in the local language - most Germans in large cities will speak some level of English, especially if they're mid-forties or under; some younger ones maybe Spanish but I wouldn't necessarily expect it. Learn a few basic words and phrases - locals will appreciate it. Even if it's \"sorry I don't speak German well, do you speak English?\"\n\nSome things I found so much easier overseas, other things more of a faff - every country and their systems have positives and negatives.",

I find the important question is not what you\u2019ll miss about your home country, but what might be different and difficult in your new country. I\u2019ve taught so many students who are convinced language will be the hardest thing, when I know from experience that little stuff, like figuring out public transport, tax rules, even going to the post office can be some of the most stressful parts of moving. \n\nIt\u2019s worthwhile looking up the stages of culture shock to help you understand the natural stages you\u2019ll go through. Know how homesickness fits into that and find small ways to connect with your home culture in ways that are important to you (for me, it\u2019s my home town beer and a sausage roll).",

No matter how tired they were from travel, first day I always brought them to get a local Sim card setup, bank if they needed, showed them transit, maps, etc. It's a lot and overwhelming at times but I gave them all of our local maps and info. In my experience,  the sooner I armed them with info, the better they started adjusting. \nJust being supportive and answering questions of how things work, local culture, etc was more important than language.",

You only see them decades later.\n\nMy parents migrated from Asia to Africa, then to Australia. I grew up in Africa and then mived to Australia at the age of 10.\n\nAll my extended family, aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins are far from me. You only see then once every few years. \n\nAnd here's where it gets tough. As the years go on, your extended family moves in one trajectory based on their life in their country, you move in a different route. You adopt new values and mannerisms from your new country, and your way of thinking changes. One day you go back to your country of origin and you feel like an outsider. You and your extended family have less in common than ever. When you go back, you start seeing the faults in your old country and it's culture, because you now have a new perspective and know how some things could be better. After decades overseas you realise you've lost your connection to your \"homeland\" and it's people. But your new country still sees you as an immigrant. Even though you have spend the majority of your life there and no longer fit in in your home culture, in the new culture you don't fit in either because your accent doesn't change, your skin colour doesn't change. After decades of calling your new country home, every stranger still asks you where you're from and when/why did you move here. Now you're like your old country on the outside, but your new country on the inside, and you'll never fit in.\n\nAt some point you get married and have kids. Your kids grow up in the new country's culture and learn about your old country through your stories and some visits back home. As they grow up, they know about their old country but they never feel at home there and aren't connected to it the way you might still be. But unless they have the new country's accent down pat, they're also stuck in this limbo of not belonging fully to either place. \n\nEventually you learn to just live in the limbo, knowing that wherever you go you'll never belong 100%. You'll encounter racism, favouritism etc but you learn to deal with it. But your kids now have opportunities in your new country that you never had, and you watch them make their life better than you could have imagined. Your struggle and the feeling of being lost pays off because you've given your kids the best chance at having a good life, and you've taught them about your culture so they're equipped to pick and live with the best elements of your old country and new country.",

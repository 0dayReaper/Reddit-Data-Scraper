    "postText": "I'm planning my solo European trip and looking at creating an itinerary that allows me to explore hidden gems while staying within my budget I've done some research and discovered that smaller, lesser-known cities and towns just an hour or so outside of larger metropolitan areas tend to be significantly more affordable. I'll be working a lot so not really concerned with doing anything touristy, but open if i have an opportunity. So far i'm considering Sorrento, Naples, and Valencia. I'm currently living in Brazil and will be leaving from Rio or Sao Paolo for logistical considerations.   \nBackground:  \nFrom August to October, I'll be in Europe, primarily to obtain my passport via Jure Sanguinis and continue my personal project on researching my family history. As my family hails from the Campania region in Avellino, Italy, and Sicily, I aim to explore these areas extensively. Italy will be my main focus, with a two-month stay, followed by one month in Spain. Since I'll be working remotely during my trip, I'd prefer to stay in each location for at least a month and venture out on day trips or weekend excursions. Wondering what would be the best way to structure my trip, whether to start in Spain or Italy and ideal locations to stay a month at a time.  \nImportant Trip Criteria:  \nCoastal Access: As August and September are prime beach months, I'm keen to find a city or a location close enough to beaches, ideally the closer the better, but at least within an hour or so distance in the summer months  \nHidden Gems: I'm eager to explore lesser-known, off-the-beaten-path cities and towns that offer more unique experiences and fit well within my budget. These hidden gems just outside larger metropolitan areas tend to be more affordable  \nWalkability and Public Transportation: Since I won't have a car, it's essential for me to choose cities that are highly walkable and provide reliable public transportation options. Renting a car for short trips is a possibility if needed.  \nSocial Opportunities: While working remotely, I'd love to be in a location that allows me to meet people, make friends, and experience the local social scene. Therefore, I'm inclined to avoid extremely small or remote towns that may lack such opportunities.  \nReliable Internet: Staying connected is crucial for my remote work. Access to reliable internet is a must to ensure I can be productive and enjoy a smooth digital experience throughout my trip  \nAccess to a gym, yoga ++  \nBudget:  \nI always try and keep my budget around $1,000/Mo for accommodations. Typically i'm staying in Airbnb's, and also have worked direct renting short term stays. I have been living in South America though mainly, so not sure if this will still be realistic in Spain/Italy. Willing to pay a little more if need be, but hoping not to exceed 1200-1300/ mo for my place.",

Beaches in Italy in August are absurd gong-shows.",

Even hostels are running around $80 for a dorm some days in places like Rome, etc.\n\nAs for hidden gems in Italy, there aren\u2019t any, really. There are less popular places but the country is too popular for that.\n\nHaven\u2019t been to Spain, so idk.",

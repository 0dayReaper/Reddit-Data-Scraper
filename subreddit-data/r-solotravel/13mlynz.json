    "postText": "Been solo travelling for about 2 months now and it seems to be more and more challenging to not think about my mom regularly. I keep thinking about something happening and not being able to be there with her, or just about wanting to share all these cool things I'm experiencing with her.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with her health or anything, but I do consider her my best friend. Naturally the feeling fluctuates throughout the day, however, recently I've been missing her more than usual and I'm finding it hard to wake up and feel really excited about plans I've made. My WiFi connection is often not strong enough to call unfortunately.\n\nStill, I love solo travelling too much to want to go back home. Hence the question, will I ever stop missing my mom so much?",

And her food. \n\nI think it\u2019s good to prioritize having regular chats with her, even if it\u2019s not every day. But having a day a week where you strive to find a good cafe and WhatsApp her. \n\nYou can write down things during the week to tell her and send photos all at once. I bet she\u2019d love to hear about your adventures. \n\nBut yeah, all in all, hoping it gets easier. Moms are the best. I bet she\u2019s missing you a lot too and would really like to hear how much you miss her. We wouldn\u2019t be out here if they hadn\u2019t raised us so fearless. \n\nGood luck!",

My mum always says to live my life, she's not that old yet. :D so I'd say maybe try to think and realise that everything is fine, you're in touch with her (maybe get a different Sim card to be able to call her and share your experiences) and remember you're not gonna be traveling your whole life.",

I would use this time to think a lot about that dynamic and your relationships with other people. I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t something you want to hear but it\u2019s a chance for you to establish some independence, a lot of growth can come from forcing yourself into challenging situations",

As an orphan since the age of 10 what I can say is that your feelings are wonderful but also think that your mom has had a separate life before you and you will too eventually. It is \u201cimportant\u201d to experience things just for yourself without any external approval, connections, real-time storytelling. You will get back and tell her all your stories. In the meantime\u2026create and live those stories\n\nEdit: I believe that as much as solo travel is great, people who do it are running from something, or looking for something. And we are social animals. Even if we don\u2019t want to admit it we would prefer seeing what we see with someone else. A family member, a partner, a friend. Solo travel by definition is being somewhat lonely. So it is perfectly normal..will the \u201cmissing\u201d someone/something ever stop\u2026unlikely. So? Answer is\u2026life..live it",

Lately though it's just getting worse than ever. My experience could differ though, it all depends on personality and how important family is. There's only one way to find out",

    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI\u2019m currently in New-Zealand on a working holiday visa, I have worked here for 2 months and been in NZ for 4 months but due to an old back injury I\u2019m not able to continue working and the only jobs I can get here all contain some form of physical labor. I had my back checked out by a doctor in NZ but I can continue traveling but have to go to a hospital when I get home.\n\nWhen I decided to go on a working holiday visa I quit my job and I\u2019ve given up my apartment. So if I decide to go home now it feels like I have failed.\n\nI have about 13k euro\u2019s left, and the main things I like to do on holiday is relaxing and exploring nature and the culture. And maybe something to mention, I\u2019m 29 years old.\n\nI have been thinking about a few scenarios in my head but I\u2019m not great in making decisions, the decision to go travel to NZ for example took over a year.\n\nThe 2 options I\u2019m thinking about;\n\n1) Just book a flight back home, I might even have an opportunity to get my old job back or apply for a job that came online 1 week ago that is something I\u2019m really looking for. But I feels like I\u2019ve failed returning just after 4 months. And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready for that.\n\n2) Book a flight to Bali first and travel SEA for about 3 months and than fly back home.\n\nWhat is your option on this and which options would you choose if you were in the same situation?\n\nThanks.",

Take that trip to Bali and see what happens after those 3 months.",

If you rely on the money earned that may be a reason to cut the trip short. If you worry about the injury and want to have it taken care of asap, that may be a reason to go home too. Otherwise, I'ld just enjoy the trip.",

And budget wise I\u2019m comfortable with spending some money the next 3 months is SEA. But not being able to work as my plan initially was it know just feels like I\u2019m traveling just to be away from home longer and not enjoying the the traveling as much unfortunately.",

In any case can't imagine anyone would be judging you on when you return they'll more likely be happy to see you, but even if they were, who cares? doubt u travelled just for other people's reactions to it. \n\nSaying all that, if your back feels OK though and you have the funds, def worth going to SE Asia for a bit and then see what you fancy doing after that.",

Sounds like it's time to head home if you're not enjoying it and just staying away for the sake of saying u went away for x amount of months. Is it an option to go home, get your back seen to and then head off again if you fancy? I've been dipping in and out of travelling since I was in my early 20s (late 30s now), there will always be more opportunities. Be a shame to use up funds just for the sake of it, when you could put them to the side and do it again in a few months (or couple of years). \n\nThis is easy for me to say, but the people who would judge u on coming home early really are not worth your time even thinking about. That to me sounds like people who aren't real friends and probably jealous you took the plunge and went off to explore.\n\nWhatever u decide, hope it feels right for you and your back is better soon :)",

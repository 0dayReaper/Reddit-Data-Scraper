    "postText": "Im planning on traveling to NZ at the end of the year and trying to understand how does the Milford track work.\n\nDo I have to book a place in advance?\n\nCan't I just get there and start traveling? If so, Do I have to sleep in one of the Huts or do you have other options? Most of the info on the internet is pretty confusing\n\nThanks in advance",

If you turn up and its full you will be turned away. It might be worth checking out one of the tour companies they link to as independent bookings seem to be full for this summer however the tour companies likely get there own allocation of spots.",

            "comment": "If the Milford Track is sold out, there are many other excellent hikes in NZ's south island that perhaps aren't as well known, but are also beautiful. I hiked the Queen Charlotte Track years ago, as well as spending two days in Abel Tasman NP hiking and kayaking. I'll always remember those as some of the most beautiful places in the world. If it's Fiordland in particular you're after, the Routeburn Track is also popular, and the Hump Ridge Track I think just earned Great Walk status. Check the DOC website for what's still available to book.",

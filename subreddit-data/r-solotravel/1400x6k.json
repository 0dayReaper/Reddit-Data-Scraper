    "postText": "What are your guys opinions on traveling solo in an RV? I recently purchased an RV and find that majority of campground are geared towards 55+ demographic. I feel like more people would consider this lifestyle of campground catered to a younger demographic. What do you guys think?\n\nAlso, I was going to buy a van. But, it was too damn expensive and I\u2019d like a little more space.",

So far the campgrounds I look at online are catered for retired demographic.\n\n\nI\u2019d specially like a coworking space if possible\n\n\nAlso, I\u2019d pay extra not to be parked right next to another RV. So far I\u2019ve found Hipcamp and harvest host which is great. But, still has some growing to do.\n\nDo you have experience traveling in an RV? What has your experience been like? Do you have any resources you can help me?",

Sure, they attract on average an older demographic, after all, few young people have an RV. \n\n&gt; I\u2019d specially like a coworking space if possible\n\nWouldn't consider that 'hostel like' though with popularity of remote work some hostels have started offering them. \n\n&gt; Also, I\u2019d pay extra not to be parked right next to another RV.\n\nWithout doubt there are some that offer more space, but I suspect on average the economics don't work out that way. I mean 5 times more space would imply roughly 5 times higher price, I don't think many people are willing to pay that. Depending on where you are, boon-docking is an option. \n\n&gt; Do you have experience traveling in an RV?\n\nNo, used a van with no facilities other than a hammock and bicycle rack for (extended) weekend trips for a while.",

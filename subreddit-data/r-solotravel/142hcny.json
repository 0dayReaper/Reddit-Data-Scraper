    "postText": "Going from Australia to Thailand next week, booked the ticket under the name 'Danny' as it autofilled and I neglected to correct it; on my passport my name is 'Daniel'. I'm currently trying to get this changed, reached out the the booking provider with a copy of my passport to try get the ticket name changed, waiting to hear back.\n\nIn the event this can't be changed or they ask me to fork out $2k for new tickets, is going on the flights and chancing it a big deal? - would I have issues at customs if anyone wants to look at my passport? It seems like an incredibly minor issue but I see how it may not be.\n\nThank you.  \n\n\nEdit: It looks like I have to wait two more days to hear back from the airlines via my booking agent regarding 'authorization' for the name change. I have no idea if this means that I'll be able to egt this changed so I'm shitting bricks but some people are saying they've had success even without being able to change this in advance. So I guess we'll see soon. Thanks for all the replies was not expecting this.\n\nEdit 2: All clear on name change for my flight up there with bangkok airways through quantas - just waiting on the authorization to change names for flights back through batik airways. For anyone that gets in a simillar situation, just contact ur booking agent ASAP, or airlines directly ahead of time and see what can be done and you should be all sweet.",

Commenting as everyone seems to be speculating vs real time experience. \n\nLike you, completely oblivious on the auto fill. I was in Asia for about 6 months and this was the only time it happened. The check in counter referred me to customer service who, with my passport corrected the issue in about 5 minutes and I was on my way. Not sure if I was lucky but I was charged no change fee and people were quiet lovely. \n\nAs one other person said, zero change you\u2019re getting on with a different name but I believe (hope) they should fix the error if you explain this to them and your passport is indeed a full name that the nickname was derived from. Good luck!",

In-between flights, every surface is \nsprayed in an antibacterial spray \n\n-if your name/birthday/something is associated with a known criminal or someone on the \u201cno-fly\u201d list, a screen pops up on our computer that we literally cannot bypass without calling a back office security and some serious questioning. \n\n-for wheelchair users, there are airlines that will accommodate you and your chair. There is a device called an \u201cEagle\u201d that can fit in the aisle of an airplane, lift you out of a wheelchair, and place you into the seat. It\u2019s actually a really cool device and you get to use it frequently for practice on your downtime. \n\n-if you don\u2019t have a super tight deadline, fly StandBy if it\u2019s available. Standby passengers pay less, but they may not get on their desired flight if there is not room. They\u2019re the first to get upgraded if there\u2019s room and typically, in my experience, you don\u2019t actually end up missing the flight. \n\n-within Canada, you can travel with any cannabis accessories and the equivalent of 30g of cannabis either in your carry on or your checked luggage\n\n-there are limits to how many carry-on bags you are allowed to bring. These vary by airline, but please keep this in mind if you\u2019re going on long journeys or moving as the service agent will not be able to take extra baggage due to load restrictions. \n\n-when you\u2019re boarding the plane, it may seem overly loud, but every airport has had a noise assessment done. The amount of time it takes to board an aircraft at the highest decibel event (another plane starting up to taxi next to the one you\u2019re boarding) is not significant enough to cause any permanent hearing loss. \n\n-some countries have embossed metal ID cards \n\n-Top tip, if you can avoid booking through a third party, avoid it. Book directly through the airline. 9/10 times, when something goes wrong, the airline can\u2019t do anything for you (hotels, food vouchers, etc) if you booked through a third party (ex: travel agents, websites like Expedia or Trivago, etc) and you\u2019ll end up having to buy a new set of last minute tickets which can cost much more than tickets purchased in advance. \n\n-most airlines give their employees some type of flight incentive, like discounted or free flights. If they choose to use these perks, they have to adhere to a dress code on all of their flights to and from the destination. Every airline is a bit different, but essentially you have to dress very \u201cbusinessy\u201d. If you fail to adhere to the dress code, they will simply revoke all flight privileges and refuse to board you onto their aircraft.",

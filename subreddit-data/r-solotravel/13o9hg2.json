Amongst the places I listed is there one that you think is less preferable for a long night out? What is your favorite city to go out in?  \n4)I am trying to do this on quite a budget so any food or other budget-related recommendations or tips would be great as well!",

            "comment": "Would taking a flight between Portugal and Madrid be an option? Would be significantly shorter. Maybe slightly more but I think the time saved might make it worth it.\n\nImo Madrid is ok. I think Seville is a much more enjoyable , has more to see and I liked the food there more as well. It ended up being my favorite city in Spain. It would take a bit longer to get to Barca if you swap it with Madrid but imo it\u2019s worth it. You could also do a day trip to Granada for the Alhambra.\n\nOverall I think your itinerary is pretty great and have enough days in each city.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nAfter 4 trips I want to try something new, in my country it's the beginning of the summer, and there are couple of hippie retreats I want to try.\n\nI did solo travel before, but it was in big cities, where I had the option to leave whenever I want and overall I wasn't locked to one place and to the same people.\n\nThese retreats are anywhere from 500 to 3000 people, but I have no one to go with, and I still want to go.\n\nI am scared because I didn't sleep in a tent in a really long time, and because I never did retreat before (outside of school trips over 8 years ago), so I am not sure what's the party \\~ meditation \\~ sleep schedule is like, and because I never did drugs before and not sure if I plan to, or how I will feel around so many people doing drugs. And mainly because I will be stuck there for 3 days, it's remote places that I will have no way to get back from without a ride at the end of the retreat, and I am scared I won't find my place, will feel lonely and it will be a nightmare.\n\nI do go to hippie parties, and mostly enjoy the atmosphere and the free dancing, but I am really scared of this one.\n\nSo I would love to hear from people who shared similar experience and tried that to give their mind.",

            "comment": "Is it a retreat like one that you pay for? I\u2019ve gone to a few hippy gatherings (rainbow fam- free camping in the woods), and only ever gone alone. I\u2019m typically kind of an outcast, also very introverted, but I have always felt super welcome and I\u2019ve always found people to hang out with the day that I get there.\n\nThe drug scene depends on the group, but nobody (decent) will pressure you to do drugs and you\u2019ll have a blast without them. At most of the gatherings I\u2019ve been to, alcohol drinkers stick to one area and non-drinkers make their own alcohol-free areas. Lots of weed and tobacco gets smoked basically everywhere. \n\nYou are almost certain to find people you get along with, as long as you\u2019re not an asshole, creepy, or judgmental, and you don\u2019t steal or start fights. I\u2019m sharing my experience as a man, though, and the experience may be different for women, but in general everyone is looking out for each other.",

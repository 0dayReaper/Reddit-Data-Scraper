    "postText": "I\u2019m 30F, POC and I look very young for my age. I\u2019ve traveled alone for the past 8 days and recent experiences has begged me to question whether it\u2019s still not widely normalized for a woman to be traveling alone. For example, I arrived at a restaurant, and after telling the host \u201ctable for one, please\u201d I wasn\u2019t approached for at least 20 minutes after being seated. I did see the waitress glance at me a couple of times, but did not approach. I tried to flag her down, but no luck. I think the reason for this is probably because I was seated next to a group of about 4-6 young people. Even one of their friends asked if the empty seat at my table was being used, and he sat decided to sit at my table. Not helping my case of being alone. It is possible the waitress thought I was in their group(which is fine) but it was obvious that I was not part of their group. Has anyone else experienced this or something remotely similar? Thanks.",

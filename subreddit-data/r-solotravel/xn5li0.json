    "postText": "Everyone having a voice and place to express themselves has turned out to be a bummer. I don't know what I was expecting from this sub but it definitely wasn't \"I'm sad, I'm having a hard time communicating in a language that was not my first language, I'm sad, I made friends with someone I only spent 3 days with and it was the deepest connection I ever had with someone in my whole life, how do I go on?\"\n\nSeriously? Just continue living your life and enjoying the amazing opportunity you have access to which is traveling. Not many people have the privilege to travel, if they did I'm sure they'd be too excited to be depressed about things not going how they assumed they would or being depressed that the friends they made went their separate ways. \n\nIsn't the reason we travel solo is to get out our comfort zone, to see new places, have new experiences, experience other cultures? Everything that happens, the good the bad is a result of our choices and the risk we took leaving our comfort zone. Not every damn connection needs to be a post of how sad you are yall went your separate ways.\n\nOf all the places I've been I never got on the plane assuming this trip is going to exactly how I planned. Fun in itself is a language, I had no trouble enjoying myself somewhere I didn't know the language. Sometimes the best times had are a result of the little words we have to share between each other, only laughter and feelings. Suddenly before we know it without us even realizing it, we're a kid all over again experiencing discomfort or joy. It's a gift and a pleasure and gives us insight and life experiences.\n\nI'm just sad to see so many young people so sad about normal things in life, especially when traveling. We have so many forms of communication today that make it easier staying in contact with one another but it's still not enough for many people. \n\nI feel like this sub is full of hopeless romantic highschoolers.\n\nI'm going to make a solo travel sub for ages 40+ even though I'm only in my 30s. 30s isn't old but this place makes me feel like I'm an old man.\n\nEdit: many people made a good point that is pretty consistent with the younger generation of today. Instagram tends to have a negative influence on peoples lives and decision making. Not that I'm old and wise because I'm not, I'm only in my 30s and an idiot at times, but social media was significantly less prevalent and present in our lives, for all ages at the time. It stayed home and didn't leave with you when you went out the door.\n\nComparison is the thief of progress my friends.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the awards. I'm going to look into making a sub that welcomes all solo travelers of any age that don't complain about the obvious trivial circumstances of solo travel. Venting will be allowed but the \"I'm sad, I have anxiety, I'm sad my best friend I only knew for 3 days left\" posts will not exist. Insight, casual discussion, laughs, advice, will be the foundation and premise of it. I will need help and if anyone would like to help I'm open to discussion and input.\n\nEdit 3: the sub exists now r/40solotravel",

Especially the younger generation just starting out, who have been so influenced by instagram and tiktok and have this unrealistic expectation that every moment is going to be picture perfect amazing. Then, when it inevitably isn't like the picture they've built up in their minds, they are ready to give up.\n\nAnthony Bourdain has maybe my favourite quote: *\"Travel isn\u2019t always pretty. It isn\u2019t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that\u2019s okay. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.\"*",

I first travelled essentially solo at age 31, albeit for work. I agreed to be posted to a foreign country for a year, but needed a couple of months first to tie up loose ends. They called and said if I would leave immediately, I could back out of the year commitment, if I wanted to. I went and was overwhelmed. If you aren't ready, then, being by yourself isn't going to help. Now, its nothing for me to travel by myself, I have over 135 stamps in the passport, sometimes months/years. Now days, I don't want to travel solo unless I can go for a couple of months minimum, eventually these young people will feel the same, I am sure.",

I enjoy doing keyword searches for places I'm going to just before I go there, to get a feel for the crowds and see what the popular sites look like at that time of year. \n\nI recently returned from Petra in Jordan last month, and man oh man are there some great reels on Instagram that make it look amazing. In reality, it really was magical but no one shows how you need to deal with aggressive locals harassing you every few steps offering to take you to the Instagram ledge that looks down on the Treasury.\n\nI have a trip to Cappadocia in Turkey planned over Thanksgiving weekend, and those Instagram reels are next level production value. Women with flowing dresses looking up at dozens of hot air balloons. That 30-foot long dress would fill up the entire single carry-on bag I use for my trips! (Plus I'm a dude, but the point stands)\n\nMy first long trip (3 months) was interrailing across Europe when I was 21. As an American, it was very unusual to do something like that at that time. Sure I got homesick at times, but I was just so overwhelmed with all the new experiences and meeting new people I never really had time to sit in my hostel feeling sorry about myself or regretting the trip. Maybe it was because I didn't have social media influencers to compare myself to, or Youtube videos that made travel seem easy and trouble free. My only point of reference was some old nerdy dude on PBS named Rick Steves. I had his book, \"Europe Through the Back Door\" as a guide and that was it. No GPS, no internet phone, no translator app and very little money. Just a sense of wanderlust. \n\n20 years later and I still love to travel, and I credit that first trip I did when I was just a kid. I also get disheartened when I see half the posts on this subreddit with these themes of loneliness, depression and regret. I really enjoy this page though, and I draw constant inspiration from the young people chasing their dreams and getting out into the world to explore.",

He had a TV show too (\"Rick Steves in Europe\" I think it was called), and I used to rent DVDs from the library to watch the episodes that corresponded with my upcoming travel plans. I lugged the guidebooks around, too.\n\nI was also in my early 20s the first time I traveled by myself, and I agree, that was an unusual thing to do for an American at the time. Some of my friends even tried to talk me out of it. I had never eaten alone in a restaurant before, and my first night in London I ate dinner at a Pizza Hut because I was so overwhelmed and didn't know where else to go and because Pizza Hut seemed safe for being familiar. Now I have no problem eating by myself in public, no matter the venue.\n\nSolo traveling in my 20s was such an incredible learning experience, and taught me a lot about myself. I learned to take things in stride when traveling. If things go south (as they sometimes inevitably do), rather than get upset I'm better equipped to focus on finding a solution, knowing there will be better days ahead.",

It taught me that nothing external can ever really fulfill you to such a degree that you can forget about yourself. From an outsider's perspective Bourdain had it all: he got to travel the world, meet people from all walks of life, was adored by millions, and was generally just cool as fuck. Yet even with all of that, he still kills himself. None of that external success could save him from whatever internal torment he was dealing with. \n\nNeither traveling nor any other outwardly-focused pursuit will \"fulfill\" you in any meaningful way unless your internal world is taken care of. You still have to live with yourself and your own mind, day in and day out, regardless of what part of the world you're in or who you're hanging out with. Coming to grips with that is hard work. \"Wherever you go, there you are.\"",

Add in the helicopter parenting style many grew up with and today's quit culture and it's a cluster.\n\nIf I get the sense that the poster might take to guidance, like an 18-year old who rented an Airbnb for 2 months in Italy who posted today, I'll offer some suggestions.  Not so much for the ones who want to call it quits after the first 24 hours.\n\nIt'd be great for a forum (which may exist) where experienced travelers can offer guidance to new travelers, including the suggestions for guided tours,, but they'd need to reach out before they go.",

You devalue their experiences and the severity of their illness by lumping them in with people who merely need hand-holding when solo traveling for the first time.  \n\nAnd I think that is OP's whole point - kids who could use their fleeting moments of loneliness to grow and be introspective, and they are catastrophizing their nervousness into full-blown clinical GAD or depression.  The vast majority of these people are merely nervous, and that is a feeling that they *should* push through.

Back then imo travel was viewed as an adventure, with ups and down, it wasnt as blown up on social media. I feel like people werent trying to make their travels look fakely luxurious or high end. Idk if that makes sense im not good at verbalizing my thoughts. Anyhow Then social media continued blowing travel up and especially with reels and tik tok i feel like a lot of people now expect travel to be luxury based off what they see online. they try to make their travels be and look luxury / high end , even if it makes no sense for their budget, to post cool flashy photos and impress others. back when i started traveling the cool posts in my opinion were not who was at the best hotel or coolest club wearing a nice dress and partying with hot influencers from hinge and posting tik toks about it , but who got to the most remote island or managed to get on a ship to antartica or hiked that one of a kind volcano in indonesia or swam with whale sharks and just posted a humble pic in worn down travel clothes and unbrushed hair (lol). I would see those non hyper edited pics or read the blog posts about such experiences and think wow i want to experience something like that! It was never wow i want to go there to take that pic to post it and get that many likes and look that cool! It was more about the activity versus the status that went a long with it, which i feel like younger generations are now traveling for \u2014 the pics, the videos, the content. I feel like for many people now a days travel is less about the actual travel activities and experiences (the ups and downs and personal growth and embracing the unknown and challenges) and more about the social media posts that come from it. If that makes any sense at all?",

I pretty much dodge social media on purpose because of the \u201cmy life is better than yours\u201d thing that goes on.

They\u2019re growing pains of trying to call the whole world your home, instead of one small point on the map.

I recall my first solo-travel experience as a bit scary in the beginning: I had a big anxiety attack, but it passed. It was not a moment I would have wanted captured on social media. Here is how it went: I took the California Zephyr from the northeast to San Francisco - and somewhere in the Midwest the train picked up a guy my age from my state. We hit it off immediately as he chose his seat next to me (providence would have that the lady who had been my seat-mate had arrived at her destination as he was boarding from said place). We had a romantic fling and held hands! \n\nThe scary part arrived when the train pulled into SF at about\u2026 1 AM? It was several hours delayed. My friend was staying downtown, but I was going several blocks to the Mission/Castro district where my hostel was already booked. At that moment of taking that step off the train I had a panic attack\u2026 it was pitch black, the surroundings were strange and seemingly desolate, there were unfamiliar sounds (the harbor, the sea lions!) and it was all so strange to me. I basically thought \u201cI want my mom!\u201d But really my panic was about how to get safely to my hostel, was there going to be a bus running at this hour, and oh shit! I have no cash just a card - I would need an ATM if I needed bus money (this was before smart phones, chip readers, etc). \n\nMy new friend gave me bus money and he (a more experienced traveler) looked me in the eyes and said everything is going to be alright. I had my atlas of the city and I prepared to walk to my hostel - and did end up walking through so many neighborhoods, and I might have then caught the bus, I don\u2019t remember. On that trip I became so comfortable with the public transportation that I just boarded any bus that was going the direction I wanted to be going.\n\nI arrived at the hostel in one piece, and it was smooth from there - but, alas, I did catch the feels for my special new friend. We bonded, had lunch together, explored, then he went on to the southwest while I stayed. We never saw each other again and that made me sad upon returning home, but the whole time in SF was blissful - and deliciously mundane. I had no problem meeting people - even the staff at the hostel were always friendly to chat with.",

Biologically, external stimuli are *supposed* to cause mild anxiety, because it promotes either a physical or physiological response to teach the lizard brain how to overcome the stimuli.  And then we experience ~personal growth~.  \n\nBut too many young people have been taught to fear stress, so they never learn to overcome it, and thus they never grow.  It's sad, and the authors of the book predict at least a generation to recognize and correct this step.",

While there's nothing wrong with wanting to be welcoming to all, travelling in your 30s or 40s is very different to travelling as a teenager or young 20 something. I think it's ok to have a sub that's designed for older travellers, and I think having a 30+ age range in a new group will naturally get rid of a lot of the whining you're trying to get away from!! Look at FlashPack, they are doing great as a company designed for older travellers!",

Like, you can try for a weekend somewhere close to home, or a cruise or some other sort of group travel where you're traveling on your own, but close to other people? What I see is a lot of people who never stepped outside of their home town suddenly booking 6-month trips on the other side of the world without any sort of research or self-awareness for what they're looking for. It makes sense about as much as stepping into a gym and trying to lift 100kg on your first try.\n\nOf course, it's natural that sometimes you'll just be sad, but if it's repeated it makes more sense to stop and evaluate what you're doing and why it doesn't fit you. People who can't function on their own should perhaps try to work on those feelings first before putting themselves in situations where they feel completely miserable.",

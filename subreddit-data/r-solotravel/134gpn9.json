    "postText": "I sent a few applications for NGO organizations found on European Youth Portal (I live in Italy), for volunteering in the social media management field and as a reporter for news articles and radio broadcasting (I am a communication and media student).\n\nOne organization out of five replied to me in less than 24 hours: the email seems okay at first reading, but now I realize a few details that might be red flags:\n\n1. the manager/recruiter wrote the wrong spelling of my name (even though she has all my main info written in my resume);\n2. the recruitment process consists of two steps: firstly, I should write down on a file my personal data (including my home address and a picture of me) along with my motivation for being part of the project, my educational background, work experience and health condition. Secondly, there is an online meeting through Facebook messenger;\n3. there are clear English spelling mistakes both in the email and on the Word file (written by the organization manager);\n4. the final sentence says \"You have to do it ASAP!\" because they are selecting the volunteer staff now and there are different projects to be part of.\n\nIn addition, there is a Powerpoint attached and it explains what is the organization about, and what the volunteers are expected to do, together with a short explanation about the training they will receive before starting volunteering. Finally, there is a short description of the accommodation, monthly pocket money (285 euro) and things to do in the leisure time. It's not specified if the volunteers will receive at least two free meals per day or not.\n\nThe organization is called PRAXIS and the project is Mediart ESC, but I haven't found any reviews online. There are just five or seven positive feedback on their Google website and Facebook page.\n\nWhat do you think about this volunteer project? Am I too paranoid or the red flags might be real?\n\nDoes anyone have a similar experience to share?\n\nIt seems legit from one side (the tasks and organization history are clearly explained), but on the other side I am concerned about the whole organization since they push the volunteer to apply asap and they video call on Facebook messenger.",

            "comment": "I'm not saying they are legit, because I have no idea of course. But none of those really sound like a red flag for a small organization in another country that you reached out to first. 2, yeah in the US asking for a photo on a resume is Not Done but in some countries it's normal, should be easy to google if it's normal in Greece. 4, urgency is more of a red flag when someone is asking you to quickly make a decision or send money or something like that, but asking for a resume ASAP when you were the one who contacted them because they're hiring soon feels reasonable.\n\nDon't rush into any decisions - if their process doesn't give you enough info, ask for what you need - talking to your supervisor? past volunteers? financial statements? whatever will make you feel comfortable.",

            "comment": "I've volunteered in Greece, it is rare to find a placement that provides accomodation to new volunteers, far less offering pocket money. It may be legit, but that's my biggest red flag in your list. Normally you'd have to sign up for several months and self fund at least 2 weeks before accomodation and pocket money is discussed  (they need to check you're worth it before offering anything) assuming you're just a basic volunteer and not a doctor or coordinator. There are several Facebook groups about volunteering in Greece, maybe run it by them before committing?",

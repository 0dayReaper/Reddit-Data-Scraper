But then,\n\n\\- If I go somewhere where I want to take photos, do I take out the nice one and leave the cheap one at hotel?\n\n\\- Do you guys go around giving two phone numbers to new people you meet and want to keep in touch with?\n\n\\- Do you keep all your emergency contacts, bank apps and 2FA procedures in only the nice phone? (and run the risk of losing access to them in case the nice phone gets lost/damaged)\n\nAll insights are appreciated!",

It's switched off, so I don't have to charge it. I always leave it at the accommodation. It is only for emergencies, if I would loose or brake my phone, so I have access to my stuff, have my contacts, etc.\n\nI always use my new phone while traveling. I bought it to use it. Just look at it like a tool. If something happens to it that is life. It has a limited life anyway, I want to make a most out of it while it last. I switch phones like every three years, as battery becomes shit, or software updates stop. Hope my current phone can last longer, we will see, at least Google offers 5 years of security updates.",

This may be useful for you in the future! I also used that as a safety net to strap it to my motorbike when I was in SEA.",

It\u2019s more about making the thief realize that they will have to take extra steps to rob you, and hopefully as a result they decide it\u2019s not worth the hassle. \n\nFor example, in my city catalytic converters get swiped a lot. I\u2019ve had some handy friends who have crafted some rebar to make a cage around it with minimal labor or time invested. Sure, somebody who has an axle grinder could cut through it, but the hope is hat the thief would look at it and say, \u201cthis isn\u2019t worth my effort when there are twenty other cars parked on the same block\u201d and move on. Especially since being quick and discreet is a substantial factor in their modus operandi. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a fail safe method but it doesn\u2019t hurt to try and make yourself not look like a target.",

I keep it secure, hotel room safe if there is one, locked in a bag otherwise.  I like to carry my newest phone, after all, I spent a bundle on it for the improved camera.  I do use a wrist leash most of the time \u2014 it\u2019s handy for photography.  I also have a crossbody phone case on a sturdy strap I use at times when photography is not a big activity.  The cross body case has a little pocket on the back that holds a credit card and small amount of cash, so don\u2019t need another handbag.  The phone is always on one or the other of these devices.  I\u2019m not just worried about thieves, but accidental loss or dropping.  \n\nI knew a guy in China just before Covid who dropped his phone, screen smashed, completely unusable.  He was leaving for another part of China next day and all his documents were on that phone.  I suggested he could use my phone, log in as himself to Google, etc which would have enabled him to get all his documents and print them at the place we were both staying.  Great idea until he realised he couldn\u2019t remember the two or three key passwords he needed to get into everything.   \n\nSo, lesson learned.  Have a ready-to-go backup, or at the very least memorise or otherwise have access to your passwords.  I have a simple, old-fashioned method for keeping passwords.  I write them down in a tiny notebook full of lots of random notes about unimportant stuff - not fully spelled out of course, just a lot of cryptic hints that make sense to me but nobody else.  The notebook stays in my carryon bag, which is always with me when I am travelling, and locked and tethered to furniture in hotel rooms.  I also have a trusted person back home who has the passwords and can read them back to me over the phone if needed.  I also have written down the details for how to access remote wipe for a lost or stolen phone, so I can do that really fast if needed.",

            "comment": "I think that I've become far more worried about theft or robbery now that we all travel with so many expensive devices. It used to be, other than a bit of cash and my passport, I had almost nothing on me that I'd think twice about losing. Lose my camera? All I lose is that day's roll of film. Lose my bag? It's got dirty laundry in it, who cares? I'd use pay phones to call home and *maybe* check my emails once a week at an internet cafe, I felt so much freer and lighter.\n\nNow, we all carry expensive mobile devices with us, and I feel like we've all become so much more paranoid. And thieves have more incentive to target travellers , even those of us who don't flash expensive jewelry or camera equipment around, because there are better odds that we're carrying something of value.\n\nMost of the time I don't stress about loss or theft. In most of Europe, Asia, etc. the biggest risk is surreptitious crime e.g. pickpocketing, so securing my stuff with cross-body bags and keeping a hand on it, separating cash and cards, and using a money belt under my clothes for my passport and backup cash/cards, is often a good enough deterrent. \n\nHowever, if I'm going somewhere with a higher rate of violent crime, that equation changes. At that point, I'll avoid carrying valuables with me when I'm out and about during the day, and try to lock everything in the safest place possible. (No, hotel safes aren't foolproof, but they're often less risky than carrying things on your person.) I'll leave my phone behind or just take my old phone with WiFi and no passwords or personal accounts. The riskiest times in those cases are when you're in transit between locations and have all your gear with you; it's often best to travel by day, in groups, and ideally get a safe driver to pick you up and drop you off door-to-door. A lot of thieves target bus stations and other popular transit locations.\n\nOh, and 2FA via mobile is the bane of my existence as a traveller, since I almost never have access to my Canadian mobile number while I'm abroad anyway. I do my best to use alternate 2FA methods like authenticator apps and such. And where possible, I get hard copy security codes and store them somewhere safe or accessible by a trusted family member or friend back home.",

Ultimately, it's there to be used so if you want to have access to the nicer camera, go for it. The important thing is that you have the second device as a backup. If you can't afford to lose/break/have the main one stolen, you probably shouldn't be carrying it anyway, at least not without insurance.\n* I don't think the point regarding the numbers is too much of an issue. You could use a platform that isn't tied to a number, or simply let them know what the other number(s) is. If you're travelling anyway, there's a good chance you'll be using a local PAYG SIM which is likely disposable. \n* I'd recommend to keep them on both, and also have an online backup. This way you have redundancy in the event one of the devices is down/inaccessible. Contacts and 2FA OTP codes can very easily be stored and synced between devices. Avoid 2FA via SMS where possible however as if you lose access to the number it's tied to then you'll be stuck. It's also a lot less secure. Most bank apps will allow you to have multiple devices linked at any one time. \n\nFrom a security standpoint, you also want to have some protocols in place in the event a phone is lost or stolen such as some of the below:\n\n* Contact the mobile provider to lock the SIM and block the IMEI of the device.\n* Change all account passwords on any account signed in. Doing this will also cause any active login sessions to expire.\n* Regenerate all 2FA codes.\n* Lock/revoke access to the device in all mobile banking apps.",

Turned out to be a fantastic idea because I ended up losing my new phone at the beach (got swept out to sea when it fell out of my pocket) and even though getting a replacement through AppleCare was simple enough it took a while, and it was such a relief to be able to get a line activated for my old phone to stay in contact with my host and family I was visiting that week. I kept the old phone in a bag in my car. I\u2019m not sure the best place to keep it if you\u2019re flying or one bagging but staying prepared for these kinds of travel emergencies is definitely a good idea.",

            "comment": "This happened to me. And no insurance on a 6 month old iPhone \ud83d\ude2d. Sorry to hear about the bad luck.\n\nI bought a cheap Samsung replacement phone from Boost just to survive the week (Mardi Gras) and take photos thinking I could use it as a back up for the future and I HATED it. A brick would have been more useful. I still couldn't do anything because I couldn't remember the passwords because I let my face do everything. The photo quality was so poor I wish I had just sucked it up and gotten another iPhone. I had to buy all the accessories and service as well so in the end it wasn't even that cheap, around $300. I walked out and realized the wall charging block wasn't in there and they said they didn't come with it. So I had to buy that too. FML. Thanks New Orleans!\n\nNow I have a better back up and when I leave the accommodation, it's a decision depending on where I go which phone I'm going to take. If it's during the day and I feel relatively safe I will take my regular phone. If it's at night, it's crowded, or I'm going out drinking, it's my back up phone. I use the back up phone for photos and use wifi, though you could buy a cheap eSIM or SIM card if you need directions, etc. It's not a perfect system but it's what I currently do. I also pay for the extra protection on the regular phone as well. \n\nAll my regular business is on my regular phone but it's a good idea to start memorizing passwords.\n\nI don't give out numbers, just socials.",

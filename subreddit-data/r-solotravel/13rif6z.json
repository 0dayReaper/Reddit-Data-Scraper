    "postText": "I've been trying to wrap my head around a destination for a trip I'm looking to take in July for 3-4 nights.  I am a late 20s female and travel alone (domestically) all the time, but have some anxiety about going out of the country alone.  I haven't been out of the country since a Cancun trip with friends in college 7 years ago so I'm really just aiming to get out of my rut and get off US soil.  I'm keeping my focus on Caribbean now, as Europe is too far out of budget (trying to stay under $2000 for flight from PHL/EWR and hotel).  Basically the purpose of this trip is to unplug from work for a few days, get out of the country/out of my comfort zone,  relax with some pool time, have a few drinks/some good food, and see someplace new.\n\n\\*Looking for a place that has some things to \"explore\", per se, I'm not a fan of going somewhere and never leaving the resort.  Doesn't necessarily have to be major excursions but even just like a cute area of shops/restaurants/etc. nearby where I could walk from the hotel to get out and see things.\n\n\\*My personal comfort level, I don't feel comfortable relying on public transportation.  I have an anxiety disorder so being alone on public transportation and trying to figure out the logistics of things, especially if there's a language barrier, is just not a good situation for me.\n\n\\*Not opposed to cruises but they're incredibly expensive/low availability this close to sailing.\n\n\\*Though not a dealbreaker, somewhere that has Marriott properties would be ideal as I'm trying to accumulate points towards a January Hawaii trip! \n\nAny input, whether it's destination, resort, places to avoid, etc. would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you! :)",

You can fly right to the island, or get an airport transfer from Belize City air port right to the ferry which may save a few bucks. The island is completely walkable so no public transport worries whilst you are here.\n\nYou could also look into The Costa Rican carribean coast or if you're looking for beautiful small island beaches, the San Blas islands of Panama are to die for!",

You can rent a bicycle and explore several beaches in the area. There is also a national park (cahuita) and an animal rescue center that are quite nice. Lots of wildlife and natural beauty! Would definitely go back.\n\nIf you travel to the Caribbean side of Costa Rica and fly into San Jose, I can recommend taking a whitewater rafting tour if that's something for you. I had never done it before but apparently it's one of the best places in the world for whitewater rafting. I'd recommend it for the tropical scenery alone, it is incredible! The tours pick you up in San Jose in the morning and drop you off at the beach in the evening.",

Very social, I meet travelers from all over each time I go. The island is very small but with a trip on the water taxi you can reach the mainland and San Pedro. Small group tours with a guide for fishing/snorkeling/Mayan ruins/cave tubing are relatively inexpensive and fun. I see lots of travelers doing routes from Mexico through Guatemala and Belize.\n\nAs a woman I say avoid the mainland, especially Belize City, without a guide. But the islands are great, the only guys who ever creep on me are the British servicemen who train on a nearby island. I regularly take walks alone in the middle of the night.\n\nDM me if you need recommendations or suggestions!",

I felt a lot more at ease on carribean islands now that solo travelling women seem to be offered a level of respect I hadn't seen elsewhere.",

If you're comfortable driving on the wrong side of the road, it's easy to rent a reliable car.\n\nYou can fly direct from JFK. Cayman Airways is great.

Not sure about a Marriott, but I'd be surprised if there wasn't one.\n\nThe French side is lovely, but there are fewer walkable areas on that side. There is \"public transportation\" on the Dutch side which is literally a fleet of small vans that travel in a loop and you wave them down when you want to get on.  Very easy, but since it's just a loop they only go to certain places (but one of them is the capital, Philpsburg.  If there are cruise ships docked it will be crowded, ghost town if not).  Taxis are rather expensive, but renting a car was pretty cheap.  Very easy to drive around the whole island (there is only one traffic light on the whole island!)\n\nThere are tons of snorkeling/scuba excursions.  Lots of lovely beaches for day trips (you pick a restaurant or resort and rent lounge chairs through them, can order food, drink at the restaurant or with the attendant).  We did beach days at Simpson Bay and Anse Marcel on the French side (so beautiful). There is also some nice hiking.\n\nDon't miss brunch at the Sint Maarten Yacht Club!",

You can walk pretty much anywhere, although I would encourage you that public transportation is very easy. The bus drivers speak English and will take either Aruban or American currency, and it's quite cheap. Private Airbnbs are quite affordable as well although I know you're looking for Marriott. All of the beaches are public, and many have palapas for shade. The small sample of locals with whom I interacted were all very kind and I had a lot of fun hanging out with them, but it's also easy to enjoy on your own. I bought groceries and occasionally ate in restaurants and spent under $900 for 10 days, including flights.",

            "comment": "Belize is a great option. I highly recommend Tobacco Caye if you like natural environments rather than more resort style places - it's a tiny island on a reef and the whole island is essentially your playground. Meals are included in accommodation and it's about $60-90/night (but it's not an all inclusive place they just make your 3 meals a day - but it's great - and there are two small bars on the island). You fly to BZE Belize City and then need to take a 15 minute flight to Dangriga and then they will arrange to collect you by boat and take you to the island. It's such an amazing beautiful place, the people are so friendly and I felt 100% safe as a solo female traveller.",

            "comment": "Aruba. Despite what Nancy Grace says, Aruba is very safe. Roundtrip direct flights from NYC/Philly area can be roughly $300, $400 max. Everyone speaks english very well so there shouldn't be much of a language barrier. You can take a cab right from the airport to the hotel area and back. They have a few Marriott properties all next to each other (I think 3-4 properties - a courtyard, 2 full service, and ritz ) at the end of the High rise hotels. All of the big chain hotels are next to each other at the High Rise area. You could easily walk out the front of your hotel or along the beach to get to other properties/restaurants and casinos. Right across the street from the hotels is Paseo Hernancia (spelling is way off probably lol). It's a little shopping/restaurant area. Theres always something going on in that area, plus there are a lot of clubs in the area now too. There are a few other restaurants all along the strip by the big hotels. You could easily spend a few days trying a bunch of different restaurants there.\n\nAlso, the Renaissance hotel is a Marriott property. It's in down town which isn't as fun anymore, a lot of the clubs moved to the high rise area. There are still shops and restaurants in that area but a lot left for the high rises a few years ago. Still good if you want a better idea of what the locals are like. The main reason I suggest the Renaissance is because they have their own private island which is perfect for a getaway. They have flamingos on the island, SUP rentals, a little bar/restaurant. I would maybe recommend a day there if you want to check out the private island.\n\nFor excursions, you could do ATVs or a tour that picks you up from the hotel and drops you right back off. There is water sport rentals right on the beach everywhere you go. There's Jolly Pirates cruise, an all inclusive snorkeling trip to see a sunken pirate ship. De Palm Island is an all inclusive island off the coast with snorkeling as well too, but I think tourists go for Jolly Pirates usually because its a bit easier (you have to take a bus past the airport to get to De Palm Island).",

I know Aruba sometimes gets a bad rap because of some isolated incidents many years ago, but I'm also an incredibly overcautious person and don't plan on being too social at night (not a club person by any means).",

You'll get on the ferry from one is the cayes, then a bus, then a boat ride down the New River. If you like Mayan ruins, I highly recommend the trip.",

Then a day seeing the beautiful beaches further up the island. Other places are in the beginning of hurricane season. You\u2019re usually good in July. I like the relaxed vibes of Vieques island off of Puerto Rico. Could do 2 nights in main island of PR and 3 nights in Vieques. San Blas Islands in Panama are awesome but it\u2019s not somewhere you stay. You explore by boat. Costa Rica has chill vibes but not the same beautiful water as a place like Curacao or PR. Lots of places in Aruba as well if you want to just get chill beach vibes with pool etc.",

You can dive, but even better, the coral and fish are directly when you enter the sea. Snorkeling is even enough instead of diving. Visiting NP Washington Slagbaai is also another option.\n\nOtherwise Barbados is a good option. Although populated. The West coast has many resorts. The East coast is more rugged and laidback. \nIn 2017 my SO and I stayed for a week in Silver Sands. We stayed at Milena &amp; Mark. You can find them on AirB&amp;B. \n\nIn both cases you do need a car to explore the island.",

    "postText": "Hi! This year I want to do the EBC trek but I really don't want to walk in a line of people all the time. I'm trying to manage my expectations but I'd honestly like to see as few people as possible. \n\nI'm wondering if late November-beginning of December would be a good bet as it is the end of season, although I assume everyone who wants to avoid crowds goes at that time. Any advice is welcomed, thank you!",

Especially once getting slightly off the main EBC route, I'd go hours without encountering people.\n\nLate November will of course be even quieter, but bottom line is I wouldn't be too worried about crowds.",

Which I believe is the beginning of peak season?\n\nHeading up there wasn't many people, there were even sections where there was no one around at all. This was even more pronounced when clouds passed through because all you could see was the trail leading into mist. Coming back down around mid-October there was a lot more people on the trail, lots of groups.. but it was only really in the bottleneck parts of the main EBC route.",

My water bottle was freezing over and the tea houses don\u2019t have any heating. \nThere was no snow though nor rain thankfully while I was there so it\u2019s doable.",

We started from the foothills and there was barely another traveler (I think we saw 2) until the trail from Lukla airport joined the main trail. Walking into Namche Bazaar was like walking into another world compared to the previous 1 1/2 weeks. Lots of people. Most of them going to Base camp though. You'll find that there are way less people on the Gokyo lakes route either way. We were usually alone on the trail and would occasionally bump into another traveler on that section.",

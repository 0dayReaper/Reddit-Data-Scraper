On planes: don't care about legroom (I am very short, hurrah for me!) or baggage (travel hand luggage only), do care about priority boarding (just to prevent having to get gate checked when the bins are full) and maybe choosing my seat if I've got a connection/very long flight.  Wouldn't look to pay more than 10% of the ticket price, max, for any of these things though.",

It was only $300 more than economy.  That is very inexpensive for business class.  It was nice, but not worth the money for me.  What that trip did was expose me to business class lounges.  Comfortable, seating, free food and drinks, massage chairs, showers, overall first class experience.\n\nI immediately signed up for a Capital One Venture X card which gives me access to over 1300 lounges worldwide.  If you look at the benefits of that card and use it correctly the benefits that it provides are far greater than the annual fees.",

I knew a friend who cheaped out and got a flight with 3 stops because it had the lowest price. The first flight was delayed, and it had a domino effect of disrupting the connecting flights. I think she ended up spending money on 2 extra nights at a hotel at the last minute because of that \"cheap\" plane ticket. Plus the hassle of getting rebooked on later flights.\n\n* Departing late morning and arriving around check-in time at a hotel, like 3:00 p.m. Paying for early check-in is annoying, but waiting around all day for your hotel room is too.\n\n* Layovers are minimum 2 hours. In case the flight arrives late, I can still make my transfer to my connecting flight. But no longer than 3 hours. Keep in mind that planes often start boarding around 30 minutes before takeoff. I just use that layover time to eat a leisurely meal and catch up on reading. \n\n* For a flight that's 4 hours or longer, I'll pay for more legroom. I resisted that for years, but finally caved in on a long flight and the extra comfort was totally worth it. \n\nHotels:\n\n* Cleanliness is a given.\n\n* Location. I try to base myself in the area I'll spend the most time in. Within walking distance, if possible. \n\n* If I'm staying at a hotel because of a conference, I'll stay in the same hotel where the conference is happening. Makes the logistics 100x easier. I can roll out of bed and be in the conference hall in 5 minutes. I can stay up late at the hotel bar--where the best networking happens--and just take an elevator back to my room at the end of the night. Instead of having to wait for a taxi and take a ride back to an off-site hotel. Easier to spontaneously meet other attendees and go out for meals and drinks together. \n\nOn a related note, last-minute gate changes were the bane of my existence. My biggest problem with airplane transfers. I'd land, check the big screen and find the gate for my connecting flight. Go to the gate. Then when the boarding time rolls around, I don't see anybody. Check the big screen again and the gate number is different! I'd scramble and make a mad dash to the new gate, which is always far away. Barely get there in time to board the plane. \n\nIn a Reddit thead for travel tips, someone shared the tip of downloading the app for the airline you're flying on. To keep track of gate changes and other flight status details. I think Google Flights can do it too? Then after you get home, you can remove the app if you want to. Haven't had a problem with last-minute gate changes ever since.",

If it is a small one, then a short layover can still be more than enough. However, for a massive and busy airport, more time is definitely recommended. And unfortunately, at some airports I found 3 hours to be a minimum due to crowds, bad/confusing layout, all sorts of obstacles/checkpoints, or all of the above.",

I've amassed different things from every city I visit like public transit cards, library cards, event tickets, paper maps, attraction brochures, leftover currency and other random knick-knacks.\n\nI was curious as to what people keep from their travels? Maybe something that acts as a memento?  Something you can display? Maybe something you can reuse if you were to revisit? or do you throw everything out?\n\nWhat are some things you guys keep from your travels?",

I love getting toiletries locally, but then of course you use them.\n\nWhen you're traveling long-term, you're really limited in what you can feasibly take with you. I left my home country in December and have yet to buy any sort of memento except a couple of pieces of jewelry, largely because I don't have room in my pack for much (and I don't have an apartment that I'm returning to).\n\nI did start getting a bracelet at each country I spend time in, but I'm not putting much effort into finding hyper-local things. Some random dude in Peru sold me an embroidery thread one you could get anywhere, but I liked it, and now that's what I get. It's more personal in meaning as opposed to a \"look at this cool bracelet I got in Sicily.\"",

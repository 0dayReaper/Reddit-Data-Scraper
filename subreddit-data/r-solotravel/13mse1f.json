I've met a lot of guys out here, I've had a few hookups (which I'd never done before, it was fun at first). \n\nI hear stories of people meeting their significant others travelling (I know this is rare), but the guys I've met travelling just seem to be out for hookups. I know people wil say this is probably based on the 'type' of guys I choose to spend time with and my behaviour too, which I agree on, but I'm just wondering what other people's experiences have been.\n\nI've kept in contact with some of the guys through text, but they seem really interested for a while, disappear for a bit, then come back. If this was at home, I'd probably delete their number, but I wonder if this is different whilst travelling. \n\nWhat's your experiences?",

            "comment": "30M here.  While I've certainly had travel flings with people that I would have liked to turn into longer term relationships, the majority of the time logistics and life circumstances get in the way of that becoming a reality.  The closest it came to working out was when I studied abroad in Hong Kong for 6 months, but it didn't really make sense for us to do an LDR my senior year of college with her living on the opposite coast, so we broke it off before we left.  However my Scottish roommate in HK met his future wife (who was from London) there, and they now are married with a kid living in London 10 years later!\n\nThe benefits of travel relationships are that you are sort of in a perpetual \"honeymoon phase\", and your time/experiences together are condensed into a shorter overall period of time (i.e. 2 weeks together abroad may be equal to 2 months of dating in the real world).  However, what you will commonly also hear is that being with someone while you are both on vacation is usually different than living your regular lives together.\n\nMy first piece of advice is to go in with no expectations, although this is easier said than done haha.  Assuming there is good chemistry beyond just attraction, from there you need to sort out whether the logistics will allow for a relationship to evolve in a natural and fun way for both of you.  In the short term, this could mean adjusting the time frame on your current/next destinations, and finding accommodation other than a hostel dorm.  In the longer term, this means having a conversation about a possible LDR and whether either of you would be open to moving at some point (unless you already live within a reasonable distance of each other).\n\nI would say only at this point would it make sense to keep texting someone moreso than you would a regular friend you met traveling.  Sometimes a hook-up is just a nice period (or exclamation point) at the end of a sentence that was your limited time together.  Sometimes it is the first sentence in the next chapter of your life...\n\nEdit/disclaimer - I have no experience dating locals so this is all based on meeting other anglophone travelers",

And sometimes even if it\u2019s a short relationship, a meaningful connection is a meaningful connection and can be enjoyed for what it is. Also agree about honeymoon dating while traveling being very different to the reality of how it would be while you\u2019re both living your real lives. And basically it tends to be too much commitment to upend your life and move somewhere just to see where something could go unless you\u2019re both flexible anyway and you both feel very strongly about it. In both cases the woman moved to where the man lived.",

I did meet someone in New Zealand a few years ago who I spent an amazing week with. We both came back to Europe, she visited me then lockdown happened, we were stuck together for 3 months and now it's 3 years later and we're still together.\n\nWe usually travel together now but we decided early on that we won't stop each other travelling solo if we want to because it's important to us. We've travelled a lot around Europe together since then but, for example, I recently went to Central Asia alone whereas she went to Costa Rica. It was nice to come back after and to share stories. It's the exception now but sometimes one person wants to go somewhere and the other person doesn't want to go. We don't let that stop us living our dreams and it works really well.",

            "comment": "47/M (Borrowing my wife's account here, since she asked me to tell my story here, since I was the solo traveler.)\n\nI traveled solo for over 14 years (40+ countries in that time). I was never 1 of those guys into \"hook-up\" culture. But I remained open-minded to finding someone and something serious. Reason being, I have always been open to making the world my home and don't mind living in another country as long as the person I met understood, respected and didn't stand in the way of my travels. Or was open to traveling with me if we got into a relationship. \n\nI had several long-term relationships before finally getting married. The woman who was my chef during a villa vacation in Nicaragua invited me to go dancing after her shift 1 night. Dancing until 5am turned into 3 more dates during my stay. That week stay and those dates led to 2 return trips to get to know each other better. 1 stay of a month and 1 stay of 2 months. That turned into me moving there and having a nearly 3-yr relationship until our goals and interest sent us in different directions.\n\nAnother experience was a local restaurant owner who I met while traveling in Ko Samui, Thailand. I ended up staying there 9 months as we dated. Ultimately it didn't work out, because she was insecure about my travels and she didn't want to trust a manager to run her restaurant while she traveled with me. So we parted ways as friends.\n\nLastly, while shopping for land in Barahona, Dominican Republic, I was referred to my wife who is Dominican, but was living in N.Y. at the time. After reaching out to her online on Social Media, she connected me with her family that still lived in the town where I sought land. After finding the land I wanted, she told me that I owed her some candy from her country as payment. I flew to N.Y. to take it to her over dinner. A weekend of dinner dates in Manhattan along with long conversations over coffee or cocktails let us know we had a real vibe together. I flew back and forth between Dominican Republic and N.Y. every weekend until our bond and relationship grew more and more serious. After several months she then started traveling with me and ultimately moved back to Dominican Republic where we now live.\n\nWhat I can say about each situation is they happened authentically. I wasn't out looking for it, but I was always open to the idea. And I definitely have some other dating stories that weren't the best of situations. LOL",

And because traveling with people can be a good stress test and it sort of weeds out a certain type for me personally. It also really depends on how you travel. Some folks drink a lot and go out all the time while traveling and I\u2019d imagine like anywhere, meeting someone young while partying will tend to lead to something more casual vs if you are traveling somewhere more remote or in countries that are harder to travel in, that seems to naturally lend itself to meeting more people with a similar mindset as me.",

It makes the experience so much better, especially since they speak the language, they are usually a lot more emotionally in tune, and can show you the best spots. I didn\u2019t have any expectations and sort of had my guard up since I\u2019m so used to American men who are (mostly yikes). One guy I even stayed with in Ireland, he was Italian, super shy and we were almost total opposites. We did drugs together and then he started to open up, and I made him realize a lot about himself. I was the first girl to really spend that much time with him even though he was older than me. He messaged me once I left and said I was a lovely person \ud83e\udd7a lol. I went out with a guy when I was in Sicily who told me all about the Italian government, his job, etc. and he was one of the sweetest people I\u2019d ever met and such a romantic. I was skeptical he was just saying whatever to get in my pants, but he still texts me from time to time and asks how I\u2019m doing and said he really liked me. Most - if not all- of the experiences you have are going to be fleeting, but that\u2019s the beauty of it. You can\u2019t have any expectations, so if that means not hooking up then I wouldnt do it until you are more comfortable. Hookup culture is mostly a scam they tell young people, especially young women. Trust your gut.",

For context, I went to Europe for 3 months in the fall of 2022. People I met had quit/changed their jobs and decided to travel or do a post-graduation trip and even some people I met were taking time to travel after a breakup. When people are going through a life transition they are sometimes less likely to be looking for something serious and romantic as they are most likely just trying to explore the world for themselves and keep an open mind. I had many hookups on my trip and I appreciated the honesty when guys would tell me that they were not looking for something serious because they just wanted things to feel open and free. You yourself said that you just got out of a 5 year relationship and a lot of people I met were in that same situation and did not want something romantic either.",

He wanted something serious after our connection but it wasn\u2019t going to work for several reasons. \n\nI met another boy shortly after that was just a fun fling that I wouldn\u2019t want anything more with who I\u2019ve actually just recently reunited with since he\u2019s in my country. We didn\u2019t even hook up this time, just spent time together and it was nice because we are already comfortable together. I\u2019m sure we will meet up again since he\u2019s going to be here for a year. \n\nAnd then another boy who I spent some time with who I really like, he\u2019s totally my type , checks all the boxes and he\u2019s such a sweet gentlemanly thing and I\u2019m actually meeting him again in december! Coincidently we will be in the same country so it will be our second new years together and I can\u2019t wait to see him. I would consider moving to his country if I could just to take a chance, I\u2019m adventurous like that even if things don\u2019t work out, it\u2019s about the journey for me rather than the destination at this point. \n\nAnd a 3rd boy I almost fell in love with. That connection was something deep . And it was mutual. I would have said fuck it and continued to travel SEA with him if I didn\u2019t sign a contract back home and needed to be back. It seemed like it was really going to go somewhere despite the distance and we had solid plans to spend some significant time together but life took away one of his parents suddenly and the grief made that connection fade and that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not going to lie I am quite sad about it but that\u2019s life. \n\nThe point of me telling you about my different romances is that you\u2019ll come across all sorts of different boys and as long as there aren\u2019t any expectations for it to be something and the only focus is to form a genuine connection and to have fun and be kind you\u2019ll be surprised with how many good men there are out there regardless of what their intentions are . Don\u2019t go looking for it but also if there\u2019s a spark and the vibes are right , let yourself be open to things in a positive light. You can have so much fun and come home a completely different person.\n\nLive your best life out there sis \u2665\ufe0f",

I think it can be great fun and definitely adds to the experience of experiencing culture because you get to hear their stories of what it's like to grow up/live/work in their country - hearing these stories first hand can be priceless compared to reading guide books or watching documentaries.\n\nBut I am the type of person that will try to get to know you by questioning why you think and do things the way you do - I am very interested in the psychological and sociological aspects of life.\n\nI am also the type of person that much prefers to keep a very small group of tight knit friends back home and that to everyone else they get to know me more so at surface level, or at least that's the info I am happy to give. What this means is that there is no obligation to keep in touch after.\n\nSo I think overall it's great - as long as everyone is on the same page about expectation (which for me must be discussed before the meeting takes place) then all is ok. I've been lucky to meet some interesting people along the way.",

    "postText": "So in short - I go travel somewhere, work my job as normal (I'm fully remote), and then do vacation stuff in between! I tried this first last year in San Diego (check my profile for that one), and another trip earlier this year in Arizona (I may do a write-up for that trip but it was pretty awful so I don't have many good memories - and nothing against Arizona, I love it for many reasons; it was just a shitty trip)\n\n*Budget:* None specified. I tend to do AirBnbs in less popular areas for these types of trips as you can find incredible deals. Stayed in a super nice quiet convenient area of Overland Park, KS for like... $400 for 6 nights.\n\nI did find most places to be more expensive than I expected. I was spending $20+ on a single BBQ meal everywhere and still minimum $6-7 pre tax/tip on a beer (and the tax is BIG in Kansas!). Not like Montana where good craft beer is incredibly inexpensive. \n\n*Trip Length:* One week, including both weekends on either end. First weekend was spent driving to Kansas City, and the second was spent driving around eastern Kansas and exploring the city of KC.\n\n*Destination(s):* My goal was basically just \"eat a lot of good BBQ\". I think I succeeded! I also have the giant passport book of National Park units and I managed to visit two (the Harry Truman NHS in Independence and Brown vs BOE in Topeka, both of which I can recommend). Both sites felt extremely authentic as well which always contributes to historical significance. (Although I gotta say neither Independence nor Topeka were places I would rush back to... though the state house is super pretty)\n\nOther places I went to: Strataca + Cosmosphere (these are both in a randomass town like an hour north of Wichita, and they are both INCREDIBLE, particularly the Cosmosphere is probably the #1 thing I'd recommend seeing in the entire state of Kansas). Strataca is also very neat and unique, it's a giant underground salt mine. I had never heard of either place but both are on the \"8 wonders of Kansas\" of which I have now seen 4!\n\nAlso stopped by a pair of cute themed Swedish and Oz-themed towns (Lindsborg and Wamego respectively), both worth seeing, although they're tiny.\n\nI also thought Wichita was pretty neat overall, met a lot of cool people there over the first weekend! Manhattan is also a nice college town. I felt let down by Lawrence but it might've just been an off-weekend. I wanted to spend more time checking out KU but I ran out of it. The one brewery on the east side - I think it's just called Lawrence Brewing - is awesome though.\n\n*Accommodation:* Primarily AirBnb like I said for the work week. Stayed in Salida + Wichita on the \"inbound\" weekend, and then Lawrence + by the airport on the \"outbound\" one. I also had a ton of Hilton points so I paid almost nothing, although Lawrence was STUPID expensive for accommodations. Seemed to be very few hotels there? Wish I had just stayed in Manhattan honestly lol\n\n*Activities:* Drinking beer and eating BBQ. Kansas has a VERY good beer scene. Much better than Arizona, honestly. \n\n*What Went Right:* BBQ was awesome! So I know everyone has their strong opinions about this, but I'll stick to my overall sentiment of \"there's probably at least 10 or 20 places that all make REALLY good BBQ, and you can't go wrong with any of them, but many people will make it into a big deal and say \"oh only one of these is actually for real and the rest suck\". Same thing with Nashville hot chicken or &lt;insert other local hype food here&gt;\n\nWith that said... my favorite was definitely Slaps. But I didn't have any BAD experiences. I had been to Joe's before and gotten the z man (not a fan, why on *earth* would you sully high quality meats with cheese and onion rings? this isn't a hamburger!), but I went for a meat plate this time and really enjoyed. Q39, RJ's, and Buck Tui were also very good. Also non-BBQ shoutouts to Bay Boy and Spangles (the latter is a local Wichita chain which is VERY good and cheap).\n\n*What Went Wrong:* I ended up meeting a bunch of cool people the last night at a brewery and we went on a Sunday night bar crawl. Got back to my airport hotel at like 2:30 AM and planned to take a nap until 3:30 when I would head to the airport for a 5:20 flight.\n\nI did not wake up. Even with my phone across the room. NEVER happened to me before. I don't know if I set it for the wrong day (I was quite drunk) or somehow I walked over there, shut it off, and went back to sleep? Either way, wasn't a huge deal; got my awards points auto-refunded by the time I woke up and re-booked an 11 AM for a few extra points and got to miss most of my Monday work day (which was no issue). Probably drank a little too much, especially considering when I woke up at 8 AM it took me a solid minute to be like \"uhhhh something is not right here\"\n\nOther than that, I had a hell of a time trying to get my enormous rental car switched to something less obnoxious, but eventually sucked it up and went over to MCI mid-week to get that taken care of. (I had driven there from CO and then flew back).\n\nI also can confidently say that \"KC-style whiskey\" is disgusting and a travesty. Sorry not sorry. Ironically I thought J Riegers' non-whiskey products were all amazing, but goddamn everything there is expensive as hell. I didn't make it to the downstairs cocktail bar but probably saved enough for a return flight by avoiding that.\n\nMy favorite breweries, speaking as someone who has been to close to a thousand now probably: Pathlight (absolutely #1), Boulevard (very fun tour), Servaes, Casual Animal, Red Sash, and then outside of the KC metro, Manhattan Brewing was amazing and has one of the most incredible unique beers I've ever tasted. It's called Frog Wizard and it blew my mind. Honestly they might've even been better overall than Pathlight, but it's close. Oh also Nortons in Wichita is unreal. Had a fun time at Third Place as well that involved a very intense discussion about psychedelics!\n\nI was a little disappointed with both Alma Mader and BKS, both which came highly recommended. Ran out of time trying to visit more Crossroads-area breweries, so that's for next time.\n\n*Recommendations:* Cosmosphere, Slap's, Manhattan/Pathlight Brewing. \n\n*Final Verdict:* Not a place that's typically on anyone's tourist list but the Kansas side of KC is really nice! (Aside from KCK which can get a bit rough, although I meant to get over there for some famous tacos but ran out of time). It was fun for a week. Got to a Royals game too, which meant I paid $30 for a $500 seat at any other stadium and got to hear every crack of the bat. Pretty awesome! But damn that stadium is in such a super shitty \"Americanized\" area that is literally a bunch of parking lots off a highway exit. Sucks. \n\nMan I'm re-reading this review and it sounds super negative but I swear it was a fun trip! Don't mean to be too nitpicky but Kansas is an underrated place to visit and I still have many places in KC I gotta return for! Also the final shoutout is to Green Lady, the jazz club, highly recommend.",

Fun fact- KC was integral in the history of jazz music since the mob bosses that ran night clubs allowed Black musicians the ability to perform in an era when segregation was rampant. If you were good, you were gonna make the owner $$ and it didn't matter what the color of your skin was.\n\nAlso fun fact about Wamego, KS. That is actually the town where they filmed Wizard of Oz which is why it's \"oz themed!\" The original Dorothy house is still on one of the corners complete with some tiny witch feet still hanging out of the bottom!\n\nGlad you had a good experience, OP!",

Future recommendations would be Swordfish Toms (speakeasy in the cross roads), gotta get out to a sporting KC game and unlike Koffman the stadium is right across the way from legends instead of a giant parking lot, and I would also strong recommend the Kc art museum (its free and very awesome). Finally I would recommend you never give your opinion about the z-man at joes aloud (It\u2019s a terrible opinion that should be kept in your head).",

I'd travel within about 50 miles for BBQ and as you said, it's hard to go wrong. There are so many excellent BBQ places in KC. It's hard to beat a really good dry rub smoked right like they do in KC.  \nI think another underrated area is Buffalo NY. There is so much good food in the area and so many interesting places to go.",

    "postText": "[Part 2 Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/n731ou/xinjiang_uyghur_autonomous_trip_part_2/?)\n\nI\u2019m a white guy (sometimes mistaken as Arab) working in Shanghai who speaks decent Chinese. I wanted to see the place for myself. Everything I write is mostly informed by my own experience. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Day 1\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe May holidays have arrived, so I my time off to check out China\u2019s most controversial region, Xinjiang. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first speed bump came while I was waiting for my flight at Pudong Airport. I got a phone call from a Xinjiang number. It was the hotel that I had booked on [Booking.com](https://Booking.com). They told me that they are sorry, but they don\u2019t accept foreigners. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis isn\u2019t a racist thing, it\u2019s quite common in China. Everyone has to be registered with the police when thy check into a hotel in China. For Chinese people, the process is instant, as their ID cards go straight into the system. I have once wandered the streets of Zhengzhou at 2am looking for a hotel, even a nice one, and have just been told \u2018mei you wai bing\u2019. Places in China that don't see many foreigners always refuse me hotels, but the locals will be sure to take a picture of me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince the booking was made on a non-Chinese website, I was going to go full Karen on them when I arrived (1am), surely, they will apologise and help sort me a new hotel. Bad move on my part.\n\nThe plane lands in Urumqi, Xinjiang\u2019s political capital. When the plane fully stopped, it was boarded by police, and a man in a full white hazmat suit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen an announcement came over the speaker and told everyone sitting in the following seats, please exit first. As the seat names were being read out, I noticed everyone standing up were foregin, and just like that, my seat number was called. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were escorted by police down the stairs and lined up. We were asked for our; passports, job description, purpose of visit, and our hotel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh dear, I\u2019m not going to tell them that the 7 Days Inn I booked couldn\u2019t accept foreigners, but that would be the hotel\u2019s problem. \u2018Fools!\u2019, I thought. \u2018Once the police know they\u2019re accepting foreigners, they\u2019re in trouble.\u2019\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter all six foreigners are accounted for (and one Chinese guy escorted by hazmats), I was ready to go. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUrumqi at night was quiet on the way in, and once we descended the viaduct, you could see police checkpoints every few blocks. I arrived at the 7 Days Inn on Erdaowan road, and the security freaked out, \u201cWTF are you doing here?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I explained it to him and the Uyghur girl behind the counter. I said that I was left with no other choice but to come here. I told them that I had already given the police at the airport this hotel as my residence. Then they called the police. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithin three minutes, an armoured car rolled up, and a SWAT unit strolled into the lobby. Now this wasn\u2019t a SWAT worthy visit, they just happened to be the closest unit. They were quite chill, asking me the same questions I\u2019ll be asked for the rest of the trip; \u201cWhere are you from and what are you doing here?\u201d \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe leader was a tall Han looking guy with big grasses, body armour and a shotgun slinged around his back. The other three were Uyghurs and a Han/Hui, and the short Uyghur policeman combed through my passport. I told them I\u2019m from Ireland (ai-er-lan). And I kept hearing them ponder what Ai-er-lan is and if it\u2019s like Ying-Guo. I interjected and told them it\u2019s a separate country. Then they complimented my Chinese, while the leader was on the phone finding me a hotel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lobby was full of heavily armed policemen and a man giving his drunk girlfriend a piggyback into the dingy hotel lobby didn\u2019t flinch at all the police. She just laughed, said something in Uyghur to the receptionist and dismounted, off to bed. I wanted to secretly record all this but the receptionist, snitched on me, and the Uyghur police man told me to stop. Fair enough. I\u2019ll be more discrete next time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a bit of back and forth, they got me a taxi to an \u2018International Hotel\u2019 (hotels that accept foreigners). After a five-minute taxi journey, I arrived at an area surround by gates and security, inside was a \\[giant hotel\\]([https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/ba/80/f1/xiyu-international-hotel.jpg?w=900&amp;h=-1&amp;s=1](https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/ba/80/f1/xiyu-international-hotel.jpg?w=900&amp;h=-1&amp;s=1)), a shopping centre, and a few nightclubs. All of them covered in Cyrillic writing. I get to the hotel lobby and they only speak Chinese or Russian, so Chinese it is. I learned a new word, \u2018Baogao\u2019. Apparently, I needed a COVID test before staying. \n\nThe staff wrote down an address on a piece of paper and said to go to this hospital to get a test. I asked if they would be able to do that at 2:30am. The two very stone-faced night porters said yes, but I think they just wanted me gone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI jump in a taxi just outside the high security gates, there are some drunk people wandering out from the bar inside the compound, all shouting in some central Asian language I can\u2019t even guess. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe taxi takes me to the hospital and the police outside the hospital (heavily armed) tell me to come back in the morning, so back to the hotel they tell me \u201cmei ban fa\u201d, which means they can\u2019t give me a room and to just kindly .... fuck off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy last option is to just stay at the airport floor for the night, and even that\u2019s not an option because it\u2019s closed. Airport hotel? Funny enough they don\u2019t take foreigners, which is expected of an airport hotel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got into my sixth taxi in four hours, a Hui man, really chatty and the first to tell me that my Chinese sucks. He said the good hotels are too expensive and his friend has a cheap hotel nearby he can sneak me into. I could\u2019ve jumped into bed with him, it didn\u2019t matter. I just needed to sleep. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though the taxi driver and his receptionist friend were talking to me as if they were fleecing me and enjoying it, I got a decent enough deal. I pay for two nights and if the police find out and turf me out before the second night, I get my money back. But I was ready to argue with these heavily strapped police, because I wasn\u2019t given a choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a good night\u2019s sleep.  I was ready to get my test the next day and pay out the arse for the luxury hotel that would be forced upon me. For security reasons. . . . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Will OP get his BaoGao? Will he be tested orally or up the bum bum? Will he get approached by the police 6 times or 10 times over the next five days? Will this story include pictures? Stay tuned!\\*\\*",

Urumqi is the only place I know of that requires it, actually.\n\n&gt;and the hotels before leaving.\n\nThis part though, someone living here should absolutely do more due diligence than expecting to show up at 1am and argue their way to success.",

I did compare Trump America to Xi China though, which i think is fair.\n\nAs for rights, most developed countries have higher standard of living, higher score of freedom index and higher HDI score than the US.

It wasn't just _one_ random school shooting was it? You downvoters really don't think there's any connection between a country fundamentally founded on genocide and gun violence, and its modern day problems with guns?\n\nLook, I'll just cut to the chase, I'm fascinated to know how vocal critics of China's genocide justify the European colonisation of the Americas? I'm British BTW (so part of the problem), and don't want to deny or distract from China's blatant atrocities, but on what moral grounds do Westerners have for expecting China to do anything different? It's such a cheap and arrogant meme to be like MuH cHiNA sO bAd. /u/pushein  said:\n\n&gt; This is kinda like saying \u201cthere was a school shooting in Texas. Never going to America again\u201d.\n\nAnd they're right! China is bad, the USA is bad. But don't perpetuate the propaganda on either side. Yes the Chinese government is bad, but China itself is a truly beautiful country and culture. I lived there for 18 months. Yes the USA is bad too, but the country and the culture is also truly beautiful, and certainly shouldn't be judged entirely by its past and gun culture. /u/pushein was just trying to open our minds, and all you downvoters just closed them.",

Literally, the genocide stopped not because White Americans grew a conscience - it's because the US was so largely successful in wiping out most of the population. We still live on their lands and still relegate them to their ghettos. Up until quite recently, we were still colonizing them by sending their kids to Christian residential schools to force them to assimilate into the US. Your literal argument is the equivalent of me saying if China successfully wiped out the Uygher population right now, it would be ok to visit in 50 years because they stopped doing it.",

I don't know if you've ever thought more deeply about why the Holocaust is the de facto Most Evil Thing Ever, but its status as such is rather tragically convenient. The Holocaust is indeed one of the darkest events of human history but its modern remembrance also serves a double purpose of being the _single_ regrettable event of European history. As bad as the Holocaust was, it is sadly but a fraction of the genocides that Europe as a whole committed. Indeed its documented that the concentrations camps were modelled on the British concentration camps of South Africa and India, yet more genocides relegated to something like footnotes. And so yet another mere fraction of the European atrocities was the colonial genocide of the Americas. But now that the Germans are the bad guys, we can forget about that right?\n\nThe gun problem of the USA is not some random, isolated thing. Its roots reach directly into European genocide, just as the Holocaust does. The USA will never resolve its gun problem until it faces its past, which, all too pertinent to this entire thread, is disturbingly similar to what is happening in Xinjiang. So to get back on topic, no you shouldn't scrap your plans to visit China because of its atrocities, just as you shouldn't scrap your plans to visit the USA because of its gun problems.",

There is no such thing as a hotel that *can't* take foreigners.  It's just that a whole lot of them don't want to bother with the registration.  It's not even a particularly significant hassle.  You could even, in theory, register your own stay a particular hotel and they'd have really no reason (other than \"\u6ca1\u6709\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\") not to let you stay.\n\n&gt;I was going to go full Karen on them when I arrived (1am), surely, they will apologise and help sort me a new hotel.\n\nIs this serious?  Are you new here?\n\n&gt;Oh dear, I\u2019m not going to tell them that the 7 Days Inn I booked couldn\u2019t accept foreigners\n\nWow seriously, 7 Days?  That used to be one of the few cheapish places that did accept foreigners.  A 7 Days in Changchun saved my ass once when I showed up at 2am rather than the expected 7am.\n\n&gt;I said that I was left with no other choice but to come here.\n\nSo yes, you really were serious about this part (and apparently are new here)?  You're not going to \"force their hand.\"\n\n&gt;Apparently, I needed a COVID test before staying. \n\nThis part is a surprise to me.  I don't think it's needed anywhere else in China right now. [EDIT: Just asked my friend who was in Xinjiang this week also, she only needed the test in Urumqi.  Nowhere else in Xinjiang asked for it.]\n\n&gt;Stay tuned!\n\nAll that just to rant about your could-be-anywhere-in-China hotel experience?  Get to the point, man",

If you think expecting a hotel to honour your booking despite being a foreigner is \"white privilege\" and \"remnants of the colonial era\" you sure have a pretty odd view on what privilege is. OP wasn't doing stupid poses next to a war memorial or making fun of the local food, they were just looking for a place to sleep.",

This is what I considered to be indicative of his white privilege - an utter lack of respect for local customs and ways of doing things.",

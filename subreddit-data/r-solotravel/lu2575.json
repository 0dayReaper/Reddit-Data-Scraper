    "postText": "I have been reading some posts of planning (and already booking flights) to go to Italy for the summer or so this year and have been pretty surprised.\n\nThis is why i decided to make this post to tell you about the current situation and also with a very cautious look into the recent future.\n\nOf course i am no scientist and no expert, but i am a thinking person and making plan is one thing, but chosing the right time for them, is something else.\n\nI am in the south, sicily. The place, where it is the hottest all year long and where summer starts in may. (make your own reasoning)\n\nAs for now i can tell you, that many people in hospitality have already postponed a possible start for the season from the regular easter time, to July.\n\nIF they even open up the borders. Currently Italy is thinking of maybe allowing EU citizens to enter, non-EU seems to be out of question.\n\nSome tourist guides and the tourist  association i needed to meet for work have painted a quite dark picture. Logically many customers have cancelled their summer trips and so some facilities have simply decided to not accept any bookings until june. also because they always lose money/rating if they decline or cancel. If they do, be aware that the cancel policy will probably be to your disadvantage.\n\nThe vaccination process is rather slow here. Even though i have a medical condition i might get it somewhen end-summerish (which in italy means winter, lol). This also means, that letting people enter is putting at risk the local population.\n\nThe politics tried to make it all seems under control but with the current change in power in the government, many things have been slowed down.\n\nIt isn't even allowed to cross regions at the moment and though it seemed to be lifted, it simply didn't but got worse, especially in the north.\n\nUntil now there have maybe been talks, but as it isn't sure that the first vaccine also helps against the new variants, being vaccinated doesn't change your right to enter.\n\nSo to save you time, money and nerves: think twice about your travel plans to italy this summer for some beaching in capri.\n\nI know this isn't happy talk, but i hope i could provide some insight. And honestly, i think this applies to all of europe \\[sic\\]",

We've barely started vaccinating and we've already had several scandals. Batch order of syringes from China which, turns out, aren't suitable for vaccinations. Lots of vaccines given out to politicians and friends of friends. Last month 1st round of vaccinations stopped because someone in govt suddenly realized that there were not enough vaccines for 2nd round for those who already had done 1st. Now turns out we have some vaccines but the government is super ineffective in distributing them and lot of them are now just stored in warehouses (and I won't be surprised if some expire). I know several people in Prague who got vaccine because they're someone's friends' friends (definitely not elderly/risky group) while the doctors and nurses in regions have been impatiently waiting for their vaccines, many of them get sick and ICUs struggle with lack of manpower. Also, many people refuse the vaccinations since the government never did any compaign to promote it and so lots of people just keep talking about made-up pandemic by Bill Gates and crap like that.\n\nFrom outside it may look like we're safe but believe me, the government is doing their best to make us citizens lose all trust in it. Just look at our infection rate per person, I believe we were number 1 in the world until few days ago. And it was not the first time we topped the chart. Comparing us to Germany (in any aspect) makes me just smile :)\n\n[https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/02/28/europe/czech-republic-coronavirus-disaster-intl/index.html](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/02/28/europe/czech-republic-coronavirus-disaster-intl/index.html) (Article isn't about vaccinations but gives you an idea about our government's ability to handle the situation.)",

Even if you're in a locale that's been doing well with the vaccine roll-out (US/UK etc.), you're taking a pretty big gamble if you're booking trips for the short-to-intermediate term. \n\nI'm not even necessarily talking just in context of contracting (or spreading) COVID, but in terms of the risk of travel restrictions. \n\nAs we've seen multiple times during the pandemic, new border closures and quarantine measures can come into effect literally overnight. If you're planning to travel internationally, those plans could be dashed on a dime by a sudden uptick in cases at your destination or spread of new variants that force the local authorities to suddenly impose new border closures or other restrictions.\n\nIf you want to travel this summer, my advice is do it domestically... and if you feel absolutely compelled to plan something international, purchase Trip Interruption/Cancellation insurance (that covers pandemic-related reasons) since there's a good chance you'll need it.\n\nObviously we all want to get back to travelling as soon as possible, but I think a much \"safer\" timeframe will be sometime between Q4 of this year and Q1/Q2 of next year - we'll have a much better sense of the trajectory of the pandemic by then, and restrictions will hopefully be hitting more a stable steady-state. This summer is way too soon to have any sense of what the int'l travel landscape will look like.",

It's about the risk you pose to their citizens, not the risk of you catching it when you visit.",

Of those that can take it, not all will take it, because like my mother in law, they are morons who believe in a Facebook post rather than proper news sources. So they won\u2019t have protection at all. The anti-vaccine nobheads could be as much as 20% of the population. But even 5% of the population is = 3 million people (in the UK). So that\u2019s 3 million plus those who can\u2019t have it because of medical reasons. Then of those that do have the vaccine it is about 90% effective. So that means it is not effective in 10% of people who have the vaccine. The Uk has a population of around 60 million. So if 3 million don\u2019t have the vaccine (anti-vax nobheads), and say another million can\u2019t have it because of medical reasons (having cancer treatment etc). That leaves 56 million who will have the vaccine. Of these the vaccine won\u2019t have an effect in 10%, which is 5.6 million. Add this to the other groups and you are looking at a total of 9.6 million who won\u2019t have any protection from COVID. \n\nNow obviously some of this 9.6 million will have a mild form of the virus if they catch it. Say about 10% of people who catch COVID go onto to be hospitalised. And about 5% of this group will die. That means about 960,000 will require hospitalisation and around 48,000 will die. Probably enough to overwhelm the NHS in the UK and most countries health care systems. \n\nObviously all of these numbers are only there if everyone who doesn\u2019t have the vaccine catches it. The less controls on movement, the less controls such as keeping 2m apart, handwashing, masks etc, the more people will likely catch COVID. Therefore don\u2019t expect control measures to be gone even after vaccines are in place, especially if you want life returning back to relatively normal with cafes, pubs, tourism open. \n\nTL:DR: vaccines aren\u2019t the end of the pandemic",

They are being incredibly conservative, but here is a good summary:  https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22291959/covid-vaccines-transmission-protect-spread-virus-moderna-pfizer\n\nTLDR: From early data, \n1) (mRNA) vaccines reduce risk of any infection - including asymptomatic - by 80-90%. \n2) For those unlucky enough to still get infected, they dramatically reduce viral load compared to an unvaccinated person. \n3) Infectiousness seems to be correlated to viral load in a fairly linear fashion (as expected)\n\nPut together \u2014 assuming the early data holds \u2014 the risk profile of a fully vaccinated person traveling is at least an order of magnitude different than an unvaccinated person. They are not going to be a significant source of \u201cstarting new outbreaks\u201d. And if they take a PCR before arriving, it\u2019s even more unlikely. Background noise compared to local transmission unless you are talking about NZ or Australia. \n\n&gt;but you're moving the goal posts and that's not at all related to what I was saying \n\nYou said things like \u201cit won\u2019t be safe to travel until at least the fall\u201d and \u201cyou risk creating new outbreaks\u201d. Based on the data, I simply disagree with both of those statements and feel like they are downplaying the effectiveness of the vaccines. \n\n&gt;I'm simply asking that people try to temper their plans/expectations to a more reasonable timeline\n\nI agree with that, if only because of bureaucracy, coordination, possible disruption in vaccine distribution, etc. But no reason not to be optimistic and hopeful and start planning as long as tickets, etc can be rebooked or cancelled.",

That way if you get to a month before the trip and it still doesn't look good, you just cancel/postpone with no stress.\n\nBut I know people who have paid for flights etc etc., I appreciate that they all want to go away, but nobody seems to consider that even if the UK govt. says we can go travel abroad, it is entirely dependent on the other countries whether they choose to let us in/let us in if we quarantine etc etc.\n\nTo be honest I'm not a fan at all of paying for holidays far in advance without the option of free cancellation (or with only the option of being able to move it to a later date), covid or not, but especially in current times I don't understand why people don't just book everything separately with free cancellation.",

Yes. It is certain or as close to certainty as we've ever been. (and btw, nobody was fucking sent back home with forks and pikes, we just all went back to quarantine once summer was gone, tourists were mostly fine).\n\nSo please, if you are reading this, don't just put your plan on hold because of something random you read on reddit, local insight and personal experiences can of course be useful from time to time, but they can also turn into blinding factors. -If I live in Italy and had my shop closed for a year, doesn't mean the country is collapsed nor that everyone's life were as disrupted as mine. Trust data, not guesses.-\n\nBe aware of that when roaming online and trust official government statements most of all. (and as of today and probably even more tomorrow yes, you can easily travel to Italy if you just follow a couple of the same guidelines that almost every Eu country laid out for the summer.)\n\nOP I'd love if you could edit and update your post as you have a dangerously high visibility for such an uninformed, biased and one-minded statement.",

And as i already said, everyone needs to look up their nation specific restrictions themselves.\n\nYou wanting tourists to come, no matter what, is actually very dangerous. I can understand that you might have a business that relies on it, but negating everything to make them come is simply irresponsible.\n\nI also never said no one should come and marked july and august as rather save.

Our vaccination process is moving fast, but I feel the media is using our success at the vaccination process to dismiss talking further about our social uprise. Things are not stable here right now. I've been living in the capital and have been stuck (not allowed to travel or otherwise just knowing its extremely disrespectful and unbeneficial to the local communities) for almost a year and a half. The only reason I would consider making any travel is to do social aid. It's in desperate need. Knowing people will fly into the capital, and then make their way to the coast, Patagonia, Easter Island etc.. and enjoy a type of freedom and privilege the citizens of the country absolutely cannot feel right now really does not sit well with me. Please keep this in mind if you were planning on coming any time soon.",

It\u2019s the next logical step, but who knows if they\u2019ll actually do it (I think they should). They\u2019re still in phase one of vaccinations, which is set to wrap up at the end of March (which is just over 75s and those with comorbidities). There are two areas on weekend lockdown in addition to the curfew, and several d\u00e9partements that are \u00ab\u00a0on watch\u00a0\u00bb for that to happen next week. Almost every d\u00e9partement is seeing a rise in rate of incidence so it\u2019s possible it\u2019ll become National. Who knows if they\u2019ll follow through with it, though. It\u2019s kind of a mess in France and I wouldn\u2019t expect anything to change anytime soon :/",

Really quick to get shitty over any tiny thing.\n\nLike yeah I get that there's a pandemic, as does every single other person on the planet, but it doesn't mean nobody can make some nice plans that they could then alter or postpone as needed if they still can't go.\n\nMy favourite is these random Reddit nobodies who last year tried to guilt trip and insult anyone who managed to get off to a holiday in the few summer months where it was possible like in Greece. If the governments of 2 countries allowed them to travel between the countries, then why wouldn't they?\n\nThe topic of the sub is fantastic, but there are some really weird and passive aggressive people here.",

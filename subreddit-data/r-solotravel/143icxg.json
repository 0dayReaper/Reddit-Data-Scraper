    "postText": "Hi! I'm currently planning a trip for early-mid July through Croatia, and after coming off a pretty hectic few weeks of travel, I want to make this trip a bit slower paced to allow myself to enjoy each place. That being said, how reasonable is this itinerary based on my desire for a relaxing yet still enriching trip?\n\n\\-Fly into Split, 4 nights \n\n\\-Brac for 3 nights\n\n\\-Hvar for 3 nights\n\n\\-Vis for 2 nights\n\n\\-Dubrovnik for 4 nights and fly out \n\nThoughts? Any recommendations for day trips/hostels/extra places are welcome! My main goal is to see some islands and beaches and not rush myself from place to place before seeing what each destination has to offer. Thanks!",

I always do these tours as a way to orient myself to the city and meet other travelers :) \nI have also scheduled a day trip from Split to Krka Waterfalls/local winery.",

You can theoretically do a day trip to Zadar from Split but it's pretty far, so might be best left for a separate trip, in conjunction with Zagreb and Slovenia.\n\nKravica is a waterfall similar to Plitvice that can be done from Dubrovnik during a Mostar tour, but Plitvice is so nice that it's worth doing on its own.",

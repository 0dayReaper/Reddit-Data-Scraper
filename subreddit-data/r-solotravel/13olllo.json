    "postText": "Spent last weekend in Amsterdam, not for partying but because I wanted to visit the Vermeer exhibition. Booked a hostel ages ago when I bought the ticket. Checked in.. well, at least I tried but I was kicked out again as they apparently have age restrictions and don't accept people over a certain age. They told me there and then it's on their website and on several places on booking. I just checked, and they only mentioned it in their booking terms and conditions right at the bottom of their Booking listing (I booked there), not readily visible if you're on mobile. So in the end I had to get an emergency room, and fortunately only paid twice the original amount. But yeah, not happy because usually the booking terms only include things like check in/out times, smoking, noise, etc. But I guess I'll always check this from now on. anyone else experienced something like this?\n\nSurprise update: The t&amp;c of the hostel, and on hostelworld mention that: \"Please note that guests who are over 35 who wish to stay in mixed dorms may be asked to move to a private room at additional cost.\" and that's all. I'd booked a female dorm and based on this should not have been dumped.",

But I didn't see it at all.  \n\n\nIt was December and the hostel wasn't full and it was just one night so they let me in anyway, but warned me \"not to get too crazy.\" I was like, \"I'm the old one here! You should warn everyone else.\"",

A group of 18 year old girls on their first trip abroad don't necessarily want a 45 year old guy leering at them in a mixed dorm, or likewise as a 20-something guy I've been made to feel pretty uncomfortable by older raunchy women.\n\nHOWEVER I was always very flexible on this and used my discretion based on conversation with the individuals. \n\nHad 40-somethings who are the life of the party and totally fit in the social atmosphere. Also had 18-20somethings who we had to politely suggest perhaps weren't in the hostel they were looking for and may be suited to one of our quieter partners.\n\nAs a general rule though, if a hostel has an age restriction in place it *will* be a party hostel even if not advertised as such, so one needs to give that some consideration before booking.",

I worked in a hostel sometime ago and you definitely had a lot of 18-year-old girls traveling by themselves. Sometimes from non-western countries especially Japan. I could definitely see how it would be easy to pray, how they are vulnerable and it makes sense for hostile staff to want to protect them a bit. But 35 seems like a weird cut off.",

I don\u2019t expect anything would happen with any roommates but that\u2019s just personal preference)\n\nOf course that\u2019s not to say that all under 35s want to party and that over 35s are an inherent threat to younger adults, that\u2019s far from the truth, but 1835s have become an easy way for hostels/hotels to establish their demographic",

No point spending time reading their descriptions and reviews if I can\u2019t book there, anyway. Not sure why they don\u2019t just state their restrictions up front instead of burying them. It would save everyone time and situations like this would be avoided. Unlike the 17yo who will turn 18 before they arrive, our next birthday isn\u2019t going to suddenly make us eligible (although, it might make us *ineligible*).",

I\u2019ve had dorm mates in some of these places in their 50s.\n\nI suspect it\u2019s just a business call on the hostel\u2019s part - if they need the bookings they don\u2019t enforce it, but if they fill up easily then they do. \n\nDefinitely something to be aware of though.",

The idea is hostels that state these rules don\u2019t want older business travelers, people transiting between cities, or oddballs stay at their hostels. However, if someone is a backpacker or they\u2019re looking to party, they will overlook the age limit. (I remember Madhouse in Prague having a 50 something man stay there and he was partying just as much as the 20 year olds and they loved having him there.)\n\nSo it\u2019s essentially a filter for the kind of crowd they prefer. And during the off season, they might not even care as a bed sold is better than an empty bed especially if someone is passing through for a night. \n\nAs for your particular experience, was it a super cheap party hostel? I know the more popular party hostels there don\u2019t have age limits.\n\nEDIT: You can also *ask* the hostel before booking about how strict they are with their age policy. When you mention that you're a backpacker and you heard good things about their hostel from other backpackers, they're more likely to be lenient and let you stay with them.  As many others have mentioned, the age policy is mostly for vibe and atmosphere reasons.",

Now that\u2019s a liability thing, and in many countries the law, so it\u2019s not necessarily directed at keeping the poor out. I have seen a few hostels though that do not allow you to stay there if you are from that state/city/etc. That\u2019s almost certainly to keep out unhoused people, because why else would they want to stay there?",

I would file a complaint to booking, so they can have this fixed. This will probably not pay you back for your lost money (unless you happen to find a nice CS worker), but maybe it can nudge them towards looking into this for the future.",

I figure if they need to set an age limit then the vibe is going to be all about hook ups, because why else would my age be relevant? As someone in a longterm relationship, I take the hint that I won't enjoy it there and book a social hostel instead.\n\nI have noticed that a lot of hostels are also gender biased. Like a lot of them will have female dorms or mixed dorms, but rarely male dorms. Sometimes they even charge extra for the mixed dorms that have the same configuration as the female dorms! I can live with the fact a hostel offers female dorms but not male dorms, but I will be taking my business elsewhere if they want to charge me extra for being a man.\n\nAlways check the small print of any hostel before you book it. Some have some weird rules. I've seen age restrictions as low as 30 so don't assume just because you're in your early 30s you won't be discriminated against based on age when you arrive. Even seen some that don't allow people from their own country to stay there.\n\nOn a related note I was recently looking at group tours to travel to some destinations in 2024 and 2025 that I am less comfortable doing solo. I noticed that some of these companies also enforce strict age limits, like GAdventures and their no over 40s rule. As I'm nearing that age I looked at those tours and compared them to the tours that don't have an age restriction and it seemed like the ones with a restriction are more fun. So I've noped out of that shit as well. \n\nThese companies seem to think that when people hit 40 they want a slower paced more relaxed itinerary, with no evening activities other than eating. Often at the same or higher price too. Like no, maybe when I'm 60. I can imagine anyone under 40 is booking the restricted tours as well, so the unrestricted ones will be full of people significantly older. Nothing against that, but it's clear that the tours are catering towards that. I'm still very much into the same travel style as I have been for the past 12 years, and I don't see that changing until my body can no longer handle it. I get limited time off work (5-6 weeks each year) so a trip with a slow pace doesn't work for me.",

They are age restricted like summer camps are age restricted. They were a thing invented for kids.   \n\n\n\\----------------------\n\n  \nIn August 1909, Richard Schirrmann, a teacher in Germany, first published his idea of inexpensive accommodation for youth travel after leading a school camping trip that was derailed by a thunderstorm. Schirrmann received considerable support and opened a makeshift hostel for hikers in the school in which he taught.  \nOn June 1, 1912, Schirrmann opened the first hostel in Altena Castle. The original hostel rooms are now a museum.  \nSchirrmann served in World War I and after observing a Christmas Truce on the Western Front in December 1915, he wondered whether \"thoughtful young people of all countries could be provided with suitable meeting places where they could get to know each other\". In 1919, he founded the German Youth Hostel Association.  \nBy 1932, Germany had more than 2,000 hostels recording more than 4.5 million overnights annually. The International Youth Hostel Federation (now Hostelling International) was founded in October 1932. It is now an organization composed of more than 90 hostel associations representing over 4,500 hostels in over 80 countries. These hostels cater more to school-aged children, sometimes through school trips, and families with school-aged children.",

    "postText": "Planning to go to Peru in early July, 14days in total. My plan for now is: \n1. first 2days in Lima \n2. 3-4days in Iquitos via plane\n3. back to Lima for a day then off to Cusco via bus\n4. Going to spend a day in Huacachina to sand board/buggy on the way to Cusco \n5. Spend 4days in Cusco/Machu Picchu. First day see Cusco. Next day go up to Aguas Calientes via bus/hiking. Third day, go up to Machu Picchu via bus. \n6. And the rest of the day to go back to Lima via bus and spend time there.\n\n\nI haven\u2019t researched much on Peruvian rainforest so love to hear any tips on that, but other than that does this sound like a realistic plan? How is the political climate in Peru right now? Also how much should I bring? How much should I expect to spend on a full restaurant meal? Just so I can get an idea of what to expect, thanks \nOh and if it help I\u2019m 23, average fit so the hiking and bus ride shouldn\u2019t have too much of a toll.",

I don\u2019t know who we booked with, but they picked us up at 4am in Cusco and supplied the best breakfast I had in Peru before taking us to the mountain.",

Difficult at times, but incredibly beautiful. You can easily spend 2 full days in Cusco. Loads to see and do and you can get used to the hights. Rainbow Mountain is overrated imo.\n\nFor 2 weeks I would do:\n\n1. Arrival Lima\n\n2. Lima\n\n3. Lima &gt; Bus to Ica/Huacachina\n\n4. Huacachina &gt; Night bus to Arequipa\n\n5. Arequipa\n\n6. Arequipa &gt; Night bus to Cusco\n\n7. Cusco\n\n8. Cusco\n\n9. Salkantay Trek\n\n10. Salkantay Trek\n\n11. Salkantay Trek\n\n12. Salkantay Trek\n\n13. Salkantay Trek &gt; back to Cusco\n\n14. Cusco flight to Lima",

Not to mention the need for yellow fever vaccine, which I could get on first day at airport -if that\u2019s still a thing- but it needs 10days minimum to kick in so pretty risky. \n\nI considered trekking to MP but I don\u2019t have too much hiking experience in general so rather not do a four days course, but I\u2019ll definitely take your advice on visiting Arequipa, and hell I\u2019ll think about have a go at Chachani after researching a bit more. But for that, I\u2019ll definitely go\n1.Lima\n2.straight to sacred valley for low altitude\n3.MP\n4.Cusco \n5.Arequipa",

Just something to be aware of. Don't expect to be able to board in the moening unless you cash out on a private tour.\n\nI assume you are headed to the hidroelectrica to then hike three hours to Aguas Calientes? I trekked to Machu Piccu and took this route back. The hike is absolutely stunning. The bus however was horrendous. Around 10 hours to memory of a lurching on very dodgy \"roads\". We had to get out and push more than once. It is however the cheapest option by far and if you wanted to have a little trek before Machu Picchu it may be worth it for you. I know someone who booked the train a couple of months in advance for $30. The train ride is supposed to be beautiful. You can also get a train from Aguas Calientes to Ollantaytambo, and a bus from Ollantaytambo to Cusco which may be cheaper.",

I'm doing a pretty similar trip, around the same time \u2014 I think we'll probably overlap a bit in Cusco, depending on your specific dates.\n\nI'm spending three weeks in Peru \u2014 2 weeks in Cusco, and 1 in Lima. In Cusco, I'm doing the Salkantay Trek (5d) to Macchu Picchu, and leaving another 8-9 days for acclimatization and/or some cool day trips: Pisac, Ollantaytambo, Palccoyo, etc. I'm also coming in time to see the Inti Raymi Festival, so that'll take a day as well.\n\nDon't really have any plans yet for Lima \u2014 would love to hear what has sounded especially interesting to you. I've heard there's a lot of cool food-related stuff... but not sure what else to explore.\n\nSounds like you've gotten the advice you needed already, but FWIW I have a few friends to have visited Peru before, and a Peruvian buddy \u2014 all of whom suggested I spend most of my time in Cusco... lots to do, cool day trips, and a nice vibe (if you don't mind other travelers).",

I changed up my plan a bit, cutting out Iquitos for Arequipa. If you are outdoors guy, it definitely offer more nearby than Lima, with Chachani, Colca, etc.",

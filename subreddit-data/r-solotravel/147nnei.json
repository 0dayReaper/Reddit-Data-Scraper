    "postText": "So finally a trip got me, including expecting men to be rubbish and trying to take advantage. Happened a bit ago. I was on top of one of the hills in Tbilisi, hoping to see some local geology next to some nice views, and find a few geocaches. I get onto a nature trail in a forest, see an outcrop, go towards it, kick some stones over on the ground and quickly see there's not a lot to see, go back to path. Suddenly I'm surrounded by three rather young guys who tell me to come with them. Huh? What? What do they want from me. One says they're police and asks what I'm doing, and that I have to come with them. Yeah, right. No uniform, the plastic card one of them shows me might as well be a library card. And besides: I've never done anything warranting being stopped by the police. These dudes have other things in mind and are certainly not police. Which shows as they want to keep me in the forest. I say I want to go back out of the forest and to the public parking place just 100m back. They won't let me, I insist and we end up on the parking place again in the end. Suddenly I'm surrounded by 6 dudes. And they repeat the police thing. One of them briefly gets into a police car. Oh! So... maybe police after all... Oops. They ask again what I was doing and that they have to search me. Wait 10 minutes, police woman will come. I explain again but didn't compute. She came, with two more police men. Now there are 9 people surrounding me. She frisks me and unpacks my backpack (was about to travel on in the evening, thus I had all stuff with me). I stand there, try to get hold of my embassy (they let me call. Even emergency number didn't work), then stand there grumpily with hands in waist. She found nothing packs everything again apart from the toothpaste as I realized the next morning. Turns out I decided to look at rocks at a location that is used by a drugs smuggler, and is monitored by police. \n\nIn the end the police woman asked why I appeared nervous. She got a lecture on men behaving badly towards afab solo travelers. She got it. I hope. My nerves only got the better of me when I was back in town. Very badly. Certainly something I'd rather not repeat.",

            "comment": "Well, the \"plastic card\" part reminded me of a similar situation that I got in my own city: I was just at the wrong place/wrong time (undercover police was looking for something) and they showed me their card, making sure that their names and other personal info were covered with their fingers/hands. I made a great scene and I ended up in the local police department. lol!\n\nThe case was that since they were undercover, they just didn't want me to know any info about them (not even their names in their ID). Just be careful. Undercover police, might seem sketchier than usual scammers.\n\nEdit: I even made a joke to them that I'm a CIA agent and showed them my US driver's license (I live in the US now) also covering any info. lol! And at that point they called their office to send a police car to arrest me. :)",

All of these in the city, in broad daylight.  This whole thing about Georgia being so safe is rubbish. And I am quite old and have been living/travelling abroad for over 20 years so pretty damn savvy. \nThat being said, I moved out of the city  to a village where my neighbors are very protective of me. Some people are so good and decent. And the dogs and cows are super nice. I'm leaving the country soon though, it seems like one problem after another.\nI'm glad you are safe and, on the end, all in one piece. I wish you safe and peaceful geological adventures!",

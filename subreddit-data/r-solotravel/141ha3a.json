    "postText": "Hi,\n\nAs a solo traveller, and also kinda shy and introverted, I find it hard to find enough things to do to occupy my day/night.  There will be times where I will just want to do things that I would normally just do at home for fun like browsing the web, playing some games on Switch, watching some tv shows.  But at the same time I feel guilty doing those things on vacation since the time is precious and I could just be doing those at home\n\nJust wondering how do you all feel?  If you do those things, how much time per day would you say you allocate towards it",

Other than that, I\u2019m very on-the-go when I travel. I don\u2019t travel to relax - I travel to experience - and I don\u2019t like the thought of paying a bunch of money to do what I can do anytime at home. BUT if your priorities on vacation are different, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that!",

Sure I can do it at home but I\u2019m never relaxed and carefree enough to JUST read, I\u2019m always thinking about a million other things I could be doing that would be more productive or less challenging (like binge watching tv). Reading on vacation is one of my favourite things in the world",

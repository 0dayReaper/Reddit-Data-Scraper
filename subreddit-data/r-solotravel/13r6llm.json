    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m currently in Ecuador volunteering at an aya retreat centre. The centre closes for the month of June and I have the opportunity to travel in South America. \n\nI\u2019m a spiritual dude, I enjoy nature, conscious partying (a techno or psy trance rave would be incredible, the logistics and price of getting to pulsar in Brazil is a bit too much unfortunately, so any other recommendations would be epic!). I enjoy organic food too. I also like surfing but wouldn\u2019t let that dictate my destination - would just be a bonus. \n\nSo I think I might spend a few days in Ba\u00f1os to check it out while I\u2019m in Ecuador and then I could head to the coast and surf, but I don\u2019t know if that would keep me entertained for a month so I\u2019d like to go to another country. \n\nI could head south on a bus to Lima for a night or two, and then go to Cusco (sacred valley, salkantay trail etc.).\n\nOr I could go north on a bus to Bagota and explore Colombia. The nature, the parties and how cheap it is appeals to me, but I know nothing about Colombia.\n\nCould you guys please give me some advice based on my personality and interests? Thanks so much &lt;3",

For me it\u2019s the most sacred place I\u2019ve been to, far beyond Cusco/sacred valley. It brings tears to my eyes and chills to my body every time I step foot on the ucayali. \n\nGranted there\u2019s not much partying there lol. If it were me Colombia would be the parting place. Super cheap, Incredible culture and all.",

Fly to Leticia and enter the amazon from there. \n\nFrom there I took the slow boat (I think it was 80 soles and 4 day journey) sleeping in a hammock sailing up the river to Iquitos Peru. From there you can fly anywhere in Peru. Or stay in Iquitos",

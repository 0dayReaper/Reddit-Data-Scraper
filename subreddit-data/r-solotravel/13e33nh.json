    "postText": "Hello! \n\nSo I plan on doing a study abroad trip to Prague next year, and right after before school starts up again I'd like to travel to interesting places in Europe. I have around 63 days for this give or take a day, and wondering what you all think. \n\nDuring the study abroad portion of being there I plan on visiting Vienna and Bratislava, but have another 3-4 day weekend which I am not quite sure what to do with, and could also use suggestions for that part. I am also planning on mainly only using Airbnb (Sometimes hotels) but I do not want to use hostels at all. \n\nThis is what I am thinking for the 63 days:\n\n* Train to Budapest, will take a day +1\n* Stay in Budapest, +3\n* Train to Bucharest, +1\n* Bucharest/Targoviste, +3\n* Bucharest Flight to Athens, +1\n* Stay in Athens, +4\n* Athens to Podgorica (Montenegro), +1\n* Stay in Podgorica, +1 (Not sure about this)\n* Bus to Split, +.5\n* Stay in Split, +2.5\n* Split to Mostar, +.5\n* Stay in Mostar +1 (Not sure about this)\n* Bus to Dubrovnik, +.5\n* Stay in Dubrovnik, +2\n* Bus or Train to Ljubljana, +.5\n* Stay in Ljubljana, +4\n* Ljubljana to Anywhere in Italy, +1\n* Stay in Italy (Most likely San Marino, Milan, etc.), +7\n* Train to Switzerland, +1\n* Stay in Switzerland + Liechtenstein, +4\n* Train to Luxembourg, +1\n* Stay in Luxembourg +1\n* Train or Bus to Brussels, +1\n* Stay in Brussels, +3\n* Flight to London, +1\n* General Stay in England and Wales, +7\n* Trip to Scotland, +1\n* Stay in Scotland (Most likely Edinburgh) +3\n* Flight to Ireland +1\n* Stay in Ireland, +5\n\nObviously I am trying to squeeze in as much as possible, but these are my questions:\n\n1. Is this trip realistic?\n2. Am I spending too little, or too long anywhere (Or not going a place that I should be going, or going to a place I shouldn't)\n3. How would travel be between any of these places, in your experience? I will be spending quite a lot of the trip on a train or bus\n4. General advice, must see places in these locations, etc. I absolutely love history so I plan on seeing quite a few castles while in Europe.",

Italy I was thinking more of spending on the Amalfi Coast, Lake Como etc. Looking at Mostar, I was thinking of cutting staying there and including at as a day trip from Dubrovnik (found a tour that does that). I am from the U.S., should have noted that I have been to Amsterdam and North West Germany in the post.",

Scotland is beautiful but worth more than 3 days and just staying in Edinburgh. \n\nAlso skip Athens and Bucharest, they are pretty out of the way, just fly to Thessaloniki or Tirana and explore a bit of Albania after which you can go up to Montenegro!  \n\nKrakow, Berlin, or Munich could be a good 4 day trip from Prague!",

Ireland not sure because I have not been yet but 5 days there actually could be enough but places I have seen online recommend more. Since you like castles, there are so many in Scotland that are worth seeing outside of just Edinburgh caste (which is great). Also outside Edinburgh in Scotland you pretty much need to rent a car unless you plan on doing a highlands tour. Same with Ireland. \n\nReally just Athens and Bucharest because they are out of the way and Greece Islands are really what is worth going to. You are wasting travel time imo to not see the best parts of the country! Same with Romania, you are missing the best parts of the country. ie missing Bran Castle in Romania (Dracula's Castle)",

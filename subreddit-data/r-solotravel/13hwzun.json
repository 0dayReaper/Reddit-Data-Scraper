    "postText": "So my ex and I were together for ten years. We were supposed to plan to travel to Europe again in 2020 after travelling Europe together in 2019. Of course the trip never happened due to covid. \n\nWe\u2019ve since broken up as he wasn\u2019t treating me nicely (and didn\u2019t treat me nicely on the trip in 2019). \n\nI\u2019m now going to Europe alone as I don\u2019t want to miss out. We never planned the 2020 trip together so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going on \u201cour\u201d trip without him. But it feels wrong to be going alone. \n\nI\u2019m excited to go alone as I\u2019ve recently discovered travelling alone is something I enjoy. But I think I\u2019m nervous to go and then become anxious while I\u2019m there if things remind me of him or I think \u201cex partner would totally love this\u201d. Which is something I still do sometimes. \n\nI\u2019m not nervous about travelling alone but I\u2019m nervous about these feelings coming up while being alone on the other side of the world. \n\nAny advice on how to avoid or overcome these feelings?\n\nOne decision I\u2019ve made to avoid this is to not travel back to places I went with him where I have bad memories attached to that place.",

It\u2019s too expensive, not enough days, too long of layovers. \n\nTheir the ones that are missing out and may never get to go in there life. \n\nGet a routine you enjoy when traveling alone. Pick a time where restaurants are not too busy. Do activities based on your schedule. Just relax and realize how lucky you are to be traveling!",

It won\u2019t always feel pretty, but you\u2019ll come out better on the other end for having done it.\n\nAre there things you liked but they didn\u2019t, so you were always prevented from doing it while traveling together?

Little things like getting the \"usual\" airport snacks, a familiar song played in a bar etc will catch you by surprise.  \n\nPerhaps the healthier way is to anticipate these feelings / thoughts will crop up but instead of spiralling down memory lane, just acknowledge them and then revel in the present moment of how amazing it is to be travelling Europe *now!*\n\nBest of luck in your travels.",

Which is definitely easier to do while alone in the hotel room lol (or even in a rental car) than out in public. Let yourself cry! Let yourself feel. Don\u2019t dwell on the sadness, but let it come up and wash through you. If you do, the feelings will pass after a few minutes. They\u2019ll come again (mine came at least once almost everyday), but it\u2019s healthy to process your emotions. And it does get better. I found it helpful and healing to process my feelings during my trip, while I was away from my normal day to day life and duties. And by the time I went home and back to normal life, I had processed most of it and was in a better place.",

    "postText": "What you'll read relates to my hitchhiking experience. I hope it will be helpful. It's my personal experience and data so not all of the tips are supposed to be prescribed for everyone. \n\n\n1- Choose a straight section of the road,\n\n rather than standing where the road turns. There are two important reasons for this. Firstly, standing at a turning point increases the risk of getting hit by a car that has no visual on you. Secondly, it is the most dangerous spot for cars to stop. It is also best to avoid bridges altogether, including the entrance, on the bridge, and around the exit area. Tunnels are a bad spot for hitchhiking too.\n\n2- Your face is your profile, \n\nso keep it visible. Avoid wearing sunglasses, as drivers need to see your eyes within the brief one or two seconds they have to assess you and decide whether to stop for you or not. Without your eyes being seen, it can be difficult for people to trust you.\n\n3- Stay Hydrated and fresh. Even if you're exhausted and have been waiting for a ride for hours, try not to show a hopeless posture. A tired posture screams: Not fun to travel with! \nRemember that hitchhiking is an exchange, and drivers often pick up hitchhikers for pleasant conversations. They may be looking to stay awake or simply bored of staring at the road. So what they really don't need is two more eyes staring at the road. It will be awkward he may drop you off sooner. They look for someone to have a cool chat with. When someone offers you a free ride, be generous enough to share some words, stories, or jokes with them.\n\n4- Trust your guts\n\n and Say no to risky rides. While it's not to say that expensive cars never stop, they usually don't. But you don't get to decide who will pick you up. There are cool people driving all kinds of vehicles. \nFrom big trucks to SUVs, Old sedans, sometimes fancy cars and even tractors. They will choose you.\nSo stand there and wait for your turn to come. Usually the one who you don't expect will stop for you.\nYou need to filter the bad ones as well. Dangerous drivers are also out there. be ready to say no and reject the creepy ones or the risky rides.\n\n6- Always have an escape plan,\n\n in case something goes wrong. However, being overly insecure can make the driver feel untrusted and offended, which might provoke negative behavior. Stay relaxed and confident, knowing you have an escape plan if needed. What you really need to know is that the driver is the vulnerable one. Cause at least one of their hands will be busy controlling the steering wheel. Their legs are busy down there as well, and they can not get their eyes off the road for a long time. Remember, in an emergency situation, which the driver wants to harm you, or changes the destination without your consent, your left leg will controls the brake, and your left hand will hold the steering wheel, giving you full control of the car and the ability to stop it quickly if necessary.\n\n7- Stand where cars are parked\n\n while waiting for someone to pick you up along the road. Look for parking lots near the road, gas stations, road restaurants, and similar places. Drivers of parked cars will have more time to observe you, analyze you and see your vulnerable humane side and understand that you're just someone in need of a ride, without any harmful intentions.\n\n8- A smile goes a long way. \n\nDon't forget to smile. It breaks the ice and proves useful when interacting with strangers.\n\n9- Avoid standing too close to passing cars\n\n or excessively thumbing for a ride. Someone who intends to pick you up will do so. In my experience, it was often when I stopped caring too much that someone stopped for me. They notice you standing there, so stay calm, enjoy watching surroundings, and trust that your ride will come. Being overly stressed about when your ride will arrive only makes it harder for you to get that ride and also will ruin your experience.\n\n10- When it gets dark hitchhiking becomes challenging, and sometimes you have to walk along the road. Choose the opposite side, the side where oncoming traffic approaches. This way, you'll have a clear view of the cars coming towards you, allowing you time to react if they come too close. Use a blinking light or your phone's screen or flashlight to indicate your presence to drivers. There are applications available with red blinkers or siren lights that can be handy if your phone has enough battery.\n\nGoodluck!\nBest regards to the asphalt!",

In my imagination,  I figure someone with a sign is probably more social or creative,  and less likely to rob or kill me.",

As a woman, I would only take other women.\n \nI haven't seen a hitchhiker in years. If I saw a girl standing by the side of the road with a sign today I would probably still pick her up, just to get her out of the situation of extreme risk she is in. But as I said, haven't seen one in years.\n\nThere is a reason why hitchhiking died out, it is always very risky, not only for the person hitchhiking, but there is at least as much risk for the person offering the ride.  Don't do this, at least not in Europe. it is extremely uncommon, and probably for a reason.",

The only bad experience I heard of, was from a female hichhiker, hichhiking in Georgia.

Do you still do that cardboard sign with destination thing, because that used to be common once, and that's what I meant with \"I haven't seen it in ages\". I would assume people use the internet these days, there is probably an app for this...",

With hitchhiking, I mean the old-fashioned way in which a person spontaneously presents themself  by the side of the road with a cardboard sign on which is written the place they want to go to. \n\nYou don't see that anymore, because now we have the internet and this gives people safer and more reliable ways to organize a ride, as you said.",

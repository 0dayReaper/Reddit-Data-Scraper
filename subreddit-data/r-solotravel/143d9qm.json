    "postText": "Sometime last year, I was inspired by a few YouTube channels (including GeoWizard) to walk across an entire country. I spent hours on Google Maps searching the world for a route that would fit a few criteria:\n\n\\- The route could be safely walked on sidewalks, trails, or quiet roads.\n\n\\- The route isn't too long.\n\n\\- There are somewhat frequent towns and rest stops along the route.\n\nAfter a lot of consideration, I decided Denmark would be the perfect \"starter\" country to walk across, that wasn't some meme country like Monaco. My route was from Kolding to Esbjerg, with several small towns along the way. Google says this route is 45 miles but I ended up walking 56 miles, in part because I wandered around Kolding for a while when I got there. I'm no athlete but I do generally walk a lot - this year I've averaged 18,000 steps/day so far. That's why I figured this would be a doable challenge.\n\nI started the first full day from my Airbnb in Kolding, with no room reserved for the following night and a vague sense that I could walk about 30 miles in a day. About halfway through the day, when I stopped at Vejen, I reserved a room in Gording. That would make the total miles for the day 36, and those last 6 were a doozy (it didn't help that it was on Danish Constitution Day, which was presumably the reason for so many shops being closed). The next morning I woke up with blisters in my feet, but I soldiered on for the last stretch and made it to Esbjerg at about 4 pm yesterday.\n\nIn retrospect I should have paced myself better - maybe cap it off at 25 miles in a day - but I'm proud of what I've done! Of course, I have a few ideas for the future:\n\n\\- Japan (already found a great route from Obama to Osaka)\n\n\\- England\n\n\\- Scotland\n\n\\- Belgium\n\n\\- Netherlands\n\n\\- Portugal",

I considered doing exactly what you did but instead I put my thumb back out on the road and a big tractor picked me up and put me on the back and away we went lumbering down the road. Several tractors later and some walking I reached the main road again",

Even that seems like a lot, but it's also a good excuse to find the nearest massage place in whatever town I was walking toward. \n\nEither way, this is incredible.

    "postText": "\n\nI'm (25F) planning my second solo trip (first time backpacking) to South East Asia. I plan on resigning from my job at the start of July so I can begin my trip sometime in mid-July or beginning August. \n\nI haven't given the trip a time limit, it really depends on when I run out of money or feel like it's time to go home - but maybe I'll take 2 to 6 months - it really depends on how it goes \n\nMy intention for this trip is to get to see eqch country in depth, from city life to nature spots - I'd rather see a handful of countries really well instead of trying to jam pack as many destinations as possible. I'm also interested in doing my PADI course but this isn't a must\n\nThe countries I'd like to visit are Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and possibly Singapore, Philippines and Malaysia\n\nOriginally I had planned to start in Bangkok and move north but after checking the weather it seems like that might not be the best idea - so I'm considering starting in Bali and moving West\n\nWhat would the best starting point be, and what would you say is a good route through the countries, especially considering the weather? I'm from the Mediterranean so I'm used to a warm humid climate, and some rain wont bother me, but I'd like to avoid monsoons where possible\n\nI'm open to hearing suggestions on places I should add or drop \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Start in Indonesia, including Bali.  It is the best time to be there.  Do some research on the best places to go (avoid Kuta) and you might find that getting your scuba certificate in the Gili Islands might be the best.  Head north from there starting in Singapore, through Malaysia including Penang and Langkawi.  Koh Tao in Thailand is probably your best bet for diving and weather.  Philippines and Vietnam will be wetter and you have to keep one eye out for Typhoons (eg. one is coming in from Guam now).",

I know many countries in SEA rely on tourism and I do plan for spending a bit more in aid of the local economy. But some locals were a bit too pushy, the sites were overcrowded. \n\nIn some markets the sellers were outright hostile if you didn't want to buy anything, transport prices in Phuket were excessive, the beaches and parts of town were quite dirty. On the upside I traveled with my sister and we had a great time together, the food was great, weather was good. It just wasn't *as* great as I was expecting, I guess. A bit of a letdown.",

Essentially these two countries have been the melting pot of multiple Asian cultures since forever.\nFor communication again Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines would be relatively easier to get by with English. If you were to choose Malaysia as a starting point, not only that it's a multicultural country and easier to get by with English but it's quite central to all southeast countries that you have in your list. Meaning it's easier to get outbound flights to the surrounding southeast asian countries. Monsoon season is inevitable and you might have to skip beaches and highlands...if those activities are must to do, it's not advisable to come here from around September till end of the year.\nThailand, Vietnam and Indonesia would be amazing countries to visit but one of the major challenges is language barrier. A lot of the locals would prefer to communicate in their national language and might not have a decent proficiency in English. I think it would not be a great problem if you're going to tourist centric area of those countries mainly.",

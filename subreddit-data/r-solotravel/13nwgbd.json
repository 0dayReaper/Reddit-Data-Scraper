    "postText": "Hello!I've been obsessing over this trip for the longest time and finally gathered the courage to book this. This is my first solo trip, and I would appreciate your feedback on my itinerary, especially if it is too optimistic. I'm also going to ask for some tips after the itinerary. Thanks for your patience!\n\n**About Me:** 28/M/Filipino. As mentioned, this is my first solo trip (I frequently travel abroad and mostly do the planning). I primarily travel for food and history/culture. I also love street photography and try incorporating photogenic streets into my itineraries. I am also introverted (Not sure how this ties in with this post, but I needed to say it).\n\n**About the itinerary:** I've only booked my flight from Manila to Hanoi (arriving early morning) and Bangkok to Manila (leaving late at night). The trip will run for 20 days (including the flight dates) from late October to November this year. I have yet to do much nitty-gritty research on accommodation and transportation (and I'd like to seek advice on this as well). However, I've prepared a very rough itinerary here:\n\n||City|Details|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Day 1|Hanoi|Arrive from Manila / Hoan Kiem Lake / Old Quarter|\n|Day 2|Halong Bay|1-night cruise|\n|Day 3|Halong Bay &amp; Hanoi|Upon arrival to Hanoi: Lotte Observation Deck *OR* Rest Time|\n|Day 4|Hanoi|Temple of Literature / Ho Chi Minh Museum / Thang Long; *Flight to Hue (Evening)*|\n|Day 5|Hue|Imperial City and Royal Tombs|\n|Day 6|Hue / Hoi An|*Travel to Hoi An*|\n|Day 7|Hoi An||\n|Day 8|Hoi An|Afternoon: Travel to Da Nang and Ho Chi Minh *Flight to HMC (Evening)*|\n|Day 9|Ho Chi Minh|Central HMC / Ben Thanh Market / Saigon Sky Deck|\n|Day 10|Mekong Delta|Full-day tour|\n|Day 11|Ho Chi Minh|Jade Emperor Pagoda / Chinatown/ Free Time|\n|Day 12|Ho Chi Minh|*Travel to Phnom Penh (Bus) and Rest*|\n|Day 13|Phnom Penh|Choeung Ek &amp; Tuol Sleng / Royal Palace / Sisowath Qway|\n|Day 14|Phnom Penh|*Travel to Siem Reap (Bus) and Rest*|\n|Day 15|Siem Reap|Angkor|\n|Day 16|Siem Reap|Tonle Sap / Free Time|\n|Day 17|Siem Reap|*Travel to Bangkok (Bus/Plane)*|\n|Day 18|Bangkok||\n|Day 19|Bangkok|Ayuthaya day trip|\n|Day 20|Bangkok||\n\nAs you can see, the itinerary contains the essentials (for now). I have yet to research off-the-beaten-path stuff (PS: if you can recommend good areas for coffee culture and drinks around these cities, that would be appreciated as well). I also have yet to research food, but I plan to survive on street food; I will look into unique restaurants and probably fit them into slower days). In any case, I'm willing to sacrifice some sights for good food or a good cup of coffee. Bangkok is pretty much free time (I've already been), though I want to visit Ayuthaya.\n\nBottomline is, though: *is this going to be a stressful trip? Also, based on what you see in the itinerary (and what I like), are there places I might have missed?*\n\nI am also anxious about intercity transfers and accommodation, as I want to balance flexibility, convenience, and cost. I'd like people that have done this path to share some tips. Could you tell me how far from the dates you booked your accommodation/tickets (or did you book them on the spot), any good areas for accommodation, did you use online services for booking (Agoda/12go asia), or reputable transport companies to search on, etc?\n\nLast note: Sorry, I couldn't give an actual number for budget - but let's say I'm willing to spend a bit more to follow (at the very least) the time allocations for each city as stated in the table above (so I'm fine to book flights, if that's the only option; but if a sleeper train/bus is on the table - why not?). I want to go cheap on accommodation (hey, as long as there's a bed, a private/clean bathroom, and reliable wifi).\n\nThank you so much!",

It's really not very nice and quite polluted, if you can skip it and replace it with a trip to Ha Giang I would certainly recommend. \n\nThe rest looks good, Hanoi had the best food imo if that's what you're after.",

I would skip Halong Bay (you have places that are similar but better in the Philippines), Hue and HCMN and instead I would do Hanoi + Ha Giang loop + Tam Coc + Hoi An.",

Anyway, it's the better major city for street food and coffee (maybe do a food tour?), and it's a bit more traditional vs say HCMC, and also it's much more walkable, so overall much better for street photography. I'd even suggest to just skip HCMC altogether and spend more time in your other destinations.\n\nFor Halong bay, it's nice enough, but I'm not sure if it's worth doing a cruise solo; anyway, you can visit it even without doing a cruise. The Mekong delta tour is not bad, but it's scenery you've probably already experienced in the Philippines (Loboc River comes to mind) and it's very touristy (nothing wrong with that, just fyi).  In their place, I'd maybe recommend something history/Vietnam war related. The Philippines does have some shared history with Vietnam on that front, that you might be interested to learn more about. Ha Giang is also a good idea. \n\nEnjoy your trip!",

Sorry, this sounds like a stupid question but I just want to hear it from you.\n\n1. You can see Halong Bay without taking a cruise.\n2. Cruise is a bit pricier than say doing a boat tour + just staying at a hotel on land.\n3. A lot/most/all of the people on the cruise are couples or families, so it can be a bit awkward for socializing (and there's usually some kind of planned social activity), especially for an introvert.\n4. If you get bored or something, there's no where else to go.\n\nAll that said, it can still be worth it, if you really want to do it (of course, goes without saying) and if you really want to experience night time on the water. It's also more restful, because you'll be able to rest on the ship while island hopping.\n\n&gt;Any specific history/Vietnam war related places that you think is essential?\n\nNo worries, if you still want to do the  Mekong delta tour, it's still nice anyway. On that note, you can do that + the cu chi tunnels (which is especially cool if you're guide is a veteran; ours spoke about serving with Filipino soldiers). Otherwise, there's a bunch of war museums in Hanoi and HCMC.\n\nPS: don't worry about appearing basic or whatever, if you really want to do it, do it! We're just here for perspective. Again, enjoy!",

I really do want to go to these places, but everyone's perspective is definitely helping me refine what I really want to do (and park some for another trip). \n\nThis itinerary will surely change. I'm thinking of totally dropping Halong (great points, by the way: my low social battery probably won't do well haha) - probably going to save this for a separate trip (perhaps with family or friends). I'll try updating this weekend!\n\nFor Cu Chi/Mekong - do you suggest doing both in one day (I saw some tours offering both in one day)?",

I would use Hanoi as my home base for all of the Vietnam time and fly from Hanoi to Phnom Penh.  Google Flights shows one way flights from HAN to PP at about $100.\n\nHue is not that interesting, Hoi An is a tourist trap, and HCMC is a generic Big Asian City.  Hanoi has great street food, coffee culture, museums, interesting architecture, and friendly people.  It is great for walking.  \n\nThere are plenty of motorcycle routes up to the north that aren't the 'Ha Giang Loop' that every tourist seems to write about these days.  Your itinerary has no mountains.  Mai Chau is less touristed and is closer to Hanoi.\n\nI liked Halong Bay, but I suggest a two night cruise.  It is scenic and the food on my boat was excellent.  Your Cambodia and Bangkok times are reasonable.\n\nI recommend staying at Hanoi Family Homestay 2 in Hanoi.  They will really take care of you.  I have visited Hanoi 5 times and always stay there.  Ask Perfume (the owner) to let you go to breakfast with her some morning.  She is a delightful person and she will be happy to do so.",

I don't know, I'll see, but thank you for sharing your thoughts!\n\nHowever, you're right in that I do not have mountains and am starting to feel I should. I'll probably adjust (Maybe less time in HCHC). Mai Chau also looks quite nice - though how accessible is it from Hanoi?\n\nThank you also for the insight on Halong Bay and for the Homestay recommendation!",

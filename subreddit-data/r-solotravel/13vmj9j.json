For the last year, I\u2019ve noticed a significant drop in the pleasure I derive from traveling and sightseeing by myself. I enjoy trips much more when with friends/ family/ partners spending time connecting in some way. But I still want to meet other people and experience so many other ways of life. I just am at a place now where I\u2019m struggling to find the energy.\n\nAnyone else ever been through these emotions?\nI\u2019ve been between living situations for almost 3 years and effectively every couple months I end up traveling so, I wonder if I am just burned out to a crisp.",

It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll never travel solo again, just not for now.",

As a woman there can be situations where in some countries I don\u2019t feel safe at all. \n\nGood luck!",

In my case I have been travelling a lot in recent years and I remember some of my earlier solo trips were amazing and I would even call them the best moments of my life but some of my recent ones have been less exciting.\n\nI'm pretty sure it's because of the large amount of trips I have taken lately and being more experienced. Now I feel like I don't stress about my plans or how I will manage to keep a schedule so it takes some of the excitement away.\n\nIn your case it also sounds like this. Travelling every 3 months is quite often and it doesn't feel so special anymore. Maybe travelling less often can relight the spark for you.",

Because my travel partners would be challenging due to added expense (such as grandkids) it's either go alone or don't go.  The latter is not an option.  I do take them places and love it, but the lack of someone else's schedule and interests is a treat, the ability to camp without complaint or eat cheaply makes more destinations possible, and I can splurge on a concert ticket or a great meal or a ballgame in a different city or take an extended road trip without doing it for 4 people.  I can birdwatch, take a class, hit a yarn shop or wander through or along  however many museums and churches or gardens or shorelines I want or just soak in a view and not feel rushed.  I do get lonely from time to time because it's true that some experiences are just better shared.",

    "postText": "I perused this thread for a few months before I decided to venture on my first international solo trip. I (28 F) am from Australia, but right now I am typing this post from London, having come back from enjoying the deliciousness that can be found at Borough Market. I felt comforted and inspired by all the people sharing their stories of travel on here and I am so glad I made the decision too finally do it. Now that I have dipped my toes in, I think I will be brave enough to go to a country where I don't speak the language.  \n\n\n For those thinking about their first solo trip, find inspiration from here. Plan for a decent amount of time so you can build confidence from knowing you have a guide to rely on, that has helped me feel really secure.\n\nThanks again guys! I am proud of myself!",

It can make you think wtf was your hold up to begin with. I recently rediscovered this myself after years on hiatus.\n\nThe world is yours. There are ups and downs like all else in life, but sounds like you're riding the wave just fine. Enjoy!",

But they had everything needed and were good for a solo traveler imo\n\nPremier Inn is also an option, a few dollars more a night though.",

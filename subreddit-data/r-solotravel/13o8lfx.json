I\u2019m going on my first solo trip around south east Asia, for context I\u2019m a 22y/o Female from New Zealand, really hoping to make friends in hostels to adventure all the cities with. I\u2019m starting in Thailand and going up north and through Vietnam and then by the time I visit the gulf of Thailand, it won\u2019t be Monsoon period as I\u2019m starting in September:) I would appreciate any advice to my plan! E.g if I\u2019m too ambitious, got too many underrated places or just any solo travelling tips in general.\r  \nMuch appreciated!\r  \n\r\n\nI haven't yet looked into commutes, but for each city, for example, if I'm in Bangkok 12th-16th, then that's down in my itinerary for 4 days to allow time to travel between cities. \n\n|Bangkok|4 days|\n|:-|:-|\n|Chiang Mai|4 days|\n|Pai|2 days|\n|Chiang Rai|2 days|\n|Luang Prabang|2 days|\n|Vang Vieng|3 days|\n|Hanoi|3 days|\n|Cat ba/ Ha Long Bay|3 days|\n|Ninh Binh|3 days|\n|Phong Nha|2 days|\n|Hue|2 days|\n|Da Nang|2 days|\n|Hoi an|2 days|\n|Dalat|3 days|\n|Ho Chi Minh City|5 days|\n|Commute to |Phuket (Flight?)|\n|Phi Phi|3 days|\n|Krabi|4 days|\n|Khao Sok|3 days|\n|Commute back to|Bangkok (Flight?)|",

If you want a chance at the better weather in Thailand in September/October, go to Koh Samui/Phangan/Tao instead.  They are in the Gulf of Thailand and are better at that time of year due to wind from the west with the monsoon (generally consdered May to October) hitting Phuket directly. In Koh Samui, you may get the rain, but you don't get as much wind.  September is the wettest month in Phuket, with October being the second wettest month of the year.  Also, regarding typhoons, they can hit the coast of Vietnam in September.  Last year there as [Typhoon Noru](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/27/asia/vietnam-typhoon-noru-da-nang-intl-hnk/index.html) in September and the year before there was another one.  \n\nAll this really means is to allow yourself to be flexible and keep one eye what is happening with the weather. You will still have a good time, but understand that it is that an ideal time to be there. It might rain just for an hour at night, or it could rain all day.  Plan on it being hot, or hot and wet.  \n\nYou will want to fly from HCMC to Phuket, as the bus would take you the best part of two days.  And plane again from Surat Thani or Krabi to Bangkok.",

    "postText": "Like I'm sure many of you on this forum I love to plan hypothetical trips when its a slow day at work. Well, a few weeks ago I was looking at things to do in Odesa, a city that's long been on my list to visit. Out of interest I had a look at hotels on booking.com and found that international guests were leaving reviews. This intrigued me, people visiting Ukraine in 2023? I had a look at https://visitukraine.today/ , the tourist board was advertising holidays in Ukraine! To cut a long story short, I soon found myself cycling to Liverpool airport and hopping on a plane to Romania!\n\nNow I should take a moment to say that it would be irresponsible for me to actually reccomend that anyone take a trip to a country that is under active invasion. While the cities in the West of Ukraine are generally safe, you are still putting your life at 1000x more risk than you are in most of the rest of the world. Ukraine will win this war and open up more to tourism in the coming months and years. For this reason I won't go into too much detail on my preparations or how I got in or out, that sort of information is very much available through the above mentioned website if you are interested. If you go, go to enjoy Ukrainian culture and hospitality and to spend money in their economy, be respectful and follow the curfews etc. Do not go to gawp at bombed out buildings or cause a nuisance. \n\n**Odesa**\n\nOdesa is like a postcard picture. Its all tree lined avenues and gingerbread buildings, quite Vienna esque! It's also hot!! The Black Sea creates a microclimate similar to Batumi in Georgia. I spent two days in the city; while museums were closed I had a lovely time ducking into extravogent Orthodox churches and drinking speciality coffee. Ukrainians seem to be really in to coffee - there are stalls on most street corners with full on espresso machines in, none of those Jacob's instant sachets you see elsewhere! On both afternoons I booked tickets to the opera house which was one of the main attractions to Odesa for me. I saw a Chopin ballet, then the Barber Of Seville the next day, both were loads of fun. There was a party atmosphere on Saturday evening, I stopped on Derybasivska St and listened to a folk band as well as watching a big old hare krishna parade! The beach is really nice, white sands with a forrested park right behind, loads of bars and cafes on the seafront.\nI knew I'd enjoy Odesa but it exceeded expectations, really proud to call it our sister city! Big &lt;3 from Liverpool.\n\n**Kyiv** \n\nOn Sunday I got the overnight train to the capital. The train is very modern and pleasant. Kyiv is a massive, grand, thriving city. It feels a lot like Berlin, you have historic tennement buildings with balconies and ornamentations right next to a renovated communist block, right next to a super modern all glass office block. Again, there were artisan coffee shops and trendy restaurants everywhere. While understandably a fair amount of tourist stuff if closed or half closed I enjoyed looking round the many gold-topped cathedrals and the catacombs underneath the Pechersk Lavra monastry. I love just rambling round cities and taking in the feel of things; looking at the imposing buildings on Khreschatyk St, getting lunch down in Podil (gentrified docks district), reading my book in Khreshchatyy Park (genuinely never seen a park like it, its a system of elevated walkways around essentially a cliff face with panoramic views of the Dnipro and Kyiv). The Kyiv metro is really cool too, its super deep and very art deco.\n\n**Conclusion/Photos**\n\nI had a really great 4 days in Ukraine, it's such a beautiful and buzzing place! I'm excited to see more of the country once the war is won.\n\nI had no problems travelling in the country as both a vegetarian and someone who has very poor language skills.\n\nIn no way did I need to go there to be reminded of this, but visiting Ukraine really drove home for me how barbaric and evil this war is. It's inspiring to see the Ukrainian people not only stand up to the terrorist oppressor, but live and laugh. If you can [donate to the defence and humanitarian efforts](https://u24.gov.ua/) then please do. \n\nI'm no photographer, but hopefully [these pics are of interest](https://imgur.com/a/5cktEoi), a fair few of them have captions :).\n\nThanks for reading!",

It is quite an interesting place and I would definitely recommend checking it out.\n\nFrom what I understood there usually is a train going from Chisinau, through Tiraspol in Transnistria, to Odesa in Ukraine, although it is currently not active as the border between Ukraine and Transnistria is closed due to the war and Transnistria being aligned with Russia.\n\nAs for the trip from Moldova to Ukraine, I copied this from my other comment:\n\nI've done almost the same trip but back in August 2022. From Romania you can catch a night train from Bucharest to Chisinau (you can buy a ticket online and pick it up at a train station in Romania), and thereafter a bus from Chisinau to Odesa (I used this website: https://infobus.eu/en, be sure to be there very early for the bus, one bus I was going with left an hour and a half before the stated departure time). The border crossing into and out of Ukraine is not really a problem, actually the Moldovan border guards were more strict both when entering from Ukraine and Romania, they ask for a proof of accommodation and ask for your purpose in Moldova. Throughout Ukraine there are military checkpoints where they will check each passengers passport.\r  \n\r\r\r  \nBe sure to get all necessary documents in order, I recommend proof of accommodation, Covid-19 Vaccination papers, insurance for Ukraine (can be bought very cheap on https://visitukraine.today/). I didn't actually need to show any of these papers except proof of accommodation upon returning to Moldova from Ukraine, but I brought them just to be sure of no problems occurring.",

Russia has been bombing Ukraine and Kyiv indiscriminately and whilst the west of the country is generally safer than the east right now, you don't know where the bombs are going to drop next.\n\nNow clearly Ukraine will need its tourism back after the war to help the economy recover, and it may well make my list of places to visit as well. But now just isn't the time. You can help their efforts from the safety of your home by donating, as you have suggested in your post.\n\nPlease, no one read this thread thinking \"that's cool, I could do that too\" like this guy did after seeing a hotel review. Ukraine will be a great holiday destination in the future once the war is won so there is no rush.\n\nBear in mind that if you travel to a country where the government advise against all travel then you will invalidate your travel insurance so if you are unlucky and get injured it is going to be a very expensive visit.",

While I do believe Ukraine's situation is unique and quite different to the other countries you mentioned, you are of course right, it's not a good idea to travel there just now, and, as I say in my post, I can't in good conscience recommend that people go there. There is a genuine risk to life. I don't think my weeks of research and thinking the trip through both morally and from a safety perspective make for particularly interesting reading, but I guess to summarise, I accept that my selfish curiosity is greater than my regard for my own safety, which is not the most healthy attitude. If I am to defend my decision at all I would just say that there is an awful lot of bad, sensationalist journalism going round that will happily let you think that the entire country is a pile of rubble, and not reflect the reality of life for the tens of millions of Ukrainians who remained or have now returned to the country.",

From Romania you can catch a night train from Bucharest to Chisinau (you can buy a ticket online and pick it up at a train station in Romania), and thereafter a bus from Chisinau to Odesa (I used this website: [https://infobus.eu/en](https://infobus.eu/en), be sure to be there very early for the bus, one bus I was going with left an hour and a half before the stated departure time). The border crossing into and out of Ukraine is not really a problem, actually the Moldovan border guards were more strict both when entering from Ukraine and Romania, they ask for a proof of accommodation and ask for your purpose in Moldova. Throughout Ukraine there are military checkpoints where they will check each passengers passport.\n\nI'm not sure how the situation is regarding Transnistria but if I recall correctly there usually is a train going from Chisinau, through Tiraspol, to Odesa, but it is not active currently because the border between Transnistria and Ukraine is closed due to the war.\n\nBe sure to get all necessary documents in order, I recommend proof of accommodation, Covid-19 Vaccination papers, insurance for Ukraine (can be bought very cheap on [https://visitukraine.today/](https://visitukraine.today/)). I didn't actually need to show any of these papers except proof of accommodation upon returning to Moldova from Ukraine, but I brought them just to be sure of no problems occurring.",

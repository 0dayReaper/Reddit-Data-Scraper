    "postText": "I have been traveling Indonesia for 2 weeks so far! I have been to Lembongan and Kuta Lombok, and currently am in Labuan Bajo. I start a sailboat tour around Komodo and nearby islands tomorrow. It ends June 11 \n\nAfter that, I have about a week of time that I\u2019m not sure what to do with before I need to fly home. I fly out of surabaya on the 19th\n\nI currently am between spending more time on Flores vs Java.\n\nFlores - heard it\u2019s beautiful. Many people suggest renting a motorbike and exploring the island / road tripping but I\u2019m nervous about this as I\u2019m a solo traveler (worried something will happen to me or the bike, and I\u2019ll be alone without help) and I don\u2019t have an international license \n\nJava - I\u2019m also allocating a few days to hike ijen and bromo, but don\u2019t know if I should just fly to Java right after my Komodo tour and explore that island some more?\n\nI love nature and off the beaten trail type things, but also don\u2019t want to be completely remote from people/other friends I could make. If that makes sense \n\nThank you!",

Ijen is very \"organized\" so you will be with a lot of other tourists but it's definitely worth it. Bromo is touristy but most of the tourists are not westerners, not sure if that matters to you. I went to Surabaya to get \"off the beaten track\" and wouldn't recommend, there isn't much to do and both the hotels I stayed in were SUPER dirty. Jojgajakarta is lovely, I wish I had spent more time there and gone to a shadow puppet show. I met some really nice people in a hostel in Jakarta and you don't see a lot of westerners there at all.",

            "comment": "Since you will be headed to Surabaya either way, I'd recommend going through Java instead. It's a busy island, yes, but its attractions don't really see as many tourists as they could/should. \n\nI'd recommend spending a few days around Yogyakarta, from where you can see Borobudur and Prambanan (both some of the finest heritage sites in Asia), as well as the quirky old buildings of the city itself and have views of Mount Merapi. There are plenty of other smaller heritage sites here too if you can spare the time, and the countryside is quite pretty. \n\nNear Surabaya, Bromo is the obvious choice, with the typical Sunrise Tour well worth the clich\u00e9 because of the surreal landscape. You could also consider visiting Madakaripura Waterfalls nearby, and maybe hike through the rest of Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park, which is less busy than the Ijen trail. \n\nFlores is great too, but I do feel Java is a better place considering you'd be more comfy with a mix of nature and accessibility.",

It's a nice island, a few things to see, easy going, was easy enough to get around. I took share taxis and buses most of the time. The highlights for me were Kelimutu and Komodo islands boat tour.  \n\nJava you're going to have more world-class sites you can visit.   I'd recommend Java personally , you won't run out of places to visit, and there are quite a few places you could go that aren't too touristed.  I really enjoyed visiting Semarang last trip, it's a unique city in Java.\n\nHappy Travels",

I don't know if these suit your tastebuds but I'd recommend you to try Gudeg Yu Djum and local snack \"Bakpia Pathok 25\". To help you move around faster, it's best to rent a scooter or use ride hailing app like Gojek or Grab. Make sure you have cash with low denoms (10K, 20K) or use your credit card as payment options.\n\nPurchase a prepaid card (e-money) in minimarket like Alfamart or Indomaret and top-up the balance, this can be used as a payment option to take a regional train from Yogyakarta to Solo and city bus in Solo\n\nTake a commuter train from Yogyakarta to Solo, Solo is somewhat less touristy. You can visit Pabrik Gula Colomadu which is an abandoned sugar factory and have rich history. Public transportation in Solo is better than Yogyakarta, you can take city bus (Batik Solo Trans) to move around. You can even walk around the center of the city as it's not as big as Yogyakarta. I'd recommend you to try Nasi Liwet, Selat, and Nasi Campur.\n\nNow moving to Malang, take a train from Solo Balapan to Malang. It's better to book a ticket in advance by using KAI application, you can use your passport to register and pay your ticket using credit card or in minimarket like Alfamart/Indomaret. You can do Ijen and Bromo in 3-4 days before moving to Surabaya.",

The volcanic fields are insanely beautiful with small villages, horses and a beautiful climb to the volcano. The sunrise hike to Mr Bromo is also pretty incredible, and makes for a well earned view.",

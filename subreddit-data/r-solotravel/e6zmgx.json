    "postText": "Hi, \n\nJust a PSA for other female solo travelers...\n\nI did lots of research before coming to Belize and read that it was generally safe. Which is good.  But, I just want to warn you that the street harassment in Belize is the worst I have ever experienced.  And I've spent 2+ years traveling (mostly on volunteer exchange websites) outside of the USA, including 1 month in Panama, 2 months in Costa Rica, and 1 week in Mexico.  In Belize, you cannot walk for 1 minute without 5+ men trying to talk to you and making weird comments about your looks and why you won't talk to them.  It ruined my time here and some days I would cancel my plans and just stay inside.  \n\nOut of the 14 countries I've traveled/lived in Belize was the #1 worst for street harassment.   \n\nWhen I met up with other women, the harassment was greatly reduced.  So I'd recommend going with a friend.\n\nI don't have a comment on safety, nothing bad happened to me here, and I don't feel like people were plotting anything.  But safety and street harassment and not the same thing.\n\nJust a PSA for women by a woman.  Sorry, but I might not return to check this post, because reddit can be toxic toward women, and I'm not in the mood for that.\n\nEnjoy your travels and report back.",

I managed to meet a bunch of other solo travelers in my Riad but all the females would be constantly cat-called, hit on, and even asked to be married to during our outings in the night. One time a girl in our group had to go get some cash from the ATM around the corner (literally a couple feet away from us) and had to return to ask if some of the guys in our group could come with her cause in the 2 min she was gone, 3 men already tried to approach her. Super crazy culture but outside of the main tourist areas (Marrakech), the trip was amazing! (Highly recommend going to the desert)",

I was cat called and hit on, even in hotels. A lot of the time it was accepted to wear shorts but that just made it worse. It was also 37\u00b0c, and I overheat.\n\nAnyway, it was really fun, I got to ride camels and a mule up a mountain and got to experience another culture, and part of our tour was a home stay in a traditional Moroccan house, up in the mountains in a small village. An American family also was on our tour and they were cool. No other country we visited we had any problems though.",

(And not taking CDs is like the #1 tip people give for Times Square, followed by: expect to pay characters you take pictures with).  You are right that it is a terrible experience, no one should be yelled at like that.\n\n(And you reminded me of a day I had to give away like 6 Lion King tickets to randoms and NO ONE would take them.)\n\nBut I am in Times Square pretty frequently.  I never get harassed at all, because I guess it is ingrained not to engage with scammers.  \n\nSo for anyone else reading this: Don't take CDs.  The monks are fake.  Anyone who approaches with a sad story (usually \"needs a bus ticket\") walk away from.  Don't say \"sorry\" don't say \"no thanks\". They just don't exist.  And expect to hand over a double digit bill for pics with Iron Man.  \n\nIf anyone gives you trouble just walk away.  There is a police station right in the center.  \n\nHowever: people handing out Comedy Show ads are fine.  There are people at the TKTS booth that are just doing their job.  There are now always interactive elements and art projects and food carts in TS, so it is definitely worth a tacky visit.",

Then you can vet out your guide ahead of time. Lots of people will offer to be your \"guide\". Walk with a purpose, learn a few basic Arabic words. chokran will be used a lot. Say no firmly when asked to buy crap, take a picture or if you are asked for a random tip for nothing. Beware that there are a ton of scams, especially in the tourist areas. Even the security guards in the Valley of the Kings will scam you or try to. This is why you need a good guide to get in the middle of a lot of that. My guide yelled at a few people to leave me alone before i had to say anything.\n\nI have done the trip solo twice (2016 and 2018) and want to go back. There is so much to see in Egypt, it is am amazing country. Do not miss the Red Sea when you are there either. World class diving.\n\nEdit to add: Your guide gets a cut for ANY place that he takes you so don't get suckered into going places that are not what you wanted to do. Things like a diversion to a cotton store/factory, alabaster factory, essential oil store, etc). If you want that stuff cool but they aren't doing you any favors buy offering to stop at these places.\n\nAlso, haggle bigtime. Expect to pay about 1/10 of the asking price",

Just to put it bluntly because it's better to be up front about safety, unless you stab the guy on first attempt in a vital area (which is HIGHLY unlikely for someone who doesn't know how to use one, let alone someone who does), adrenaline will most likely support them in the altercation for at least 30 seconds. That's plenty of time for them to disarm you and get yourself stabbed. This isn't the movies. That's a quick way to get yourself killed.",

There'll be 100s of taxi drivers waiting, all yelling at you, you'll say \"no\" and they'll follow within 30cm behind you and talk in your ear and it doesn't matter what you say they'll continue following, and if you get angry (I'll admit I've said \"fuck off\" a fair few times) they'll start laughing - it's like dealing with shithead children. They're so persistent. Even if you're arriving at the airport to catch a flight they'll try to get you a taxi. Walking around Bali is slightly better, I've never been followed but they'll still yell at you even when ignoring them and start laughing because you're ignoring them...",

I changed the subject a few times but he kept going back to how easily the locals (Belize City) picked up tourist women at night and that the guys he knew went out most nights to find tourists from the street to hook up with. I imagine that picking up people from the street is a very low % effort and involves lots of harrassment until you find someone receptive to it.",

I explained they fall in love and agree to marry. He couldn\u2019t believe people got married because they loved each other first, and it cost no livestock lol. Ultimately he was a sweet kid and it ended being a cool conversation. \n\nCat calling in Uganda wasn\u2019t all that bad compared to some Arabic and Spanish speaking countries I\u2019ve been to, but everywhere I went, men, women and children would all pet my legs if I wore shorts. Eastern Africa in general loved my tan skin and have no issue with personal space haha it took some adjusting but none of it was with ill intent.",

As a male volunteer, I had to deal with this very little (though even as a guy sometimes even I'd get catcalled by some women), but my female friends and co-workers dealt with this ALL the time. I knew intuitively it was bad from their stories and I always fully believed them, but I saw it first-hand too. What I saw was terrible, and I'm sure it paled in comparison to this shit y'all have to go through. This is particularly true of Belize City, Dangriga, and Hopkins, so if you go to those places, keep an eye out. Travel in groups when you can, it really does help. \n\nIt's worse here because it's widespread, acceptable social behavior in Belize as a guy. The way a lot of men show interest is by catcalling. It's not just targeting tourists, though that's what we'll notice and remember. The reason I say that is because unfortunately, that means it's not gonna go away. The best ways I've seen, heard, and done to get around it is to travel in groups, acknowledge the guy briefly (I'm talking a look to show that you notice them, but not a response) and move on to show you're not interested. I know this is easier said than done, and again, I say this as a guy who won't have the same level of understanding here, but this is the best advice I can give from personal experience and from what I've heard from female friends.\n\nAside from that, if anyone on this sub has questions about Belize, please feel free to PM me. I won't pretend to know about or be able to comment on everything, but I loved my 2 years there and spent a lot of time traveling there when I could. I'm happy to provide any assistance I can if you think it'll help, so please don't hesitate to ask anything.",

My family owns a cottage there and I\u2019ve been twice and we\u2019ve never had (or heard about anyone having) such a hard time. However, I would NOT recommend staying in Belize City, only fly or bus in and out! There\u2019s not much to see there and it\u2019s sadly very impoverished and crime rates are high. I stayed in Caye Caulker (as a 26yo female) and have always had a great time even when walking alone at night. I also went to San Ignacio for a short visit and had no problems there. Men will definitely approach female tourists but the key is to shut them down immediately. You can still make friends with male locals but be very clear about your intentions. I\u2019ve had to deal with the same issues in other places I\u2019ve visited, unfortunately cat calling and unwanted attention are common in many places for young female travellers. I wear my grandmothers wedding ring while I travel and say I\u2019m married if men are persistent!",

    "postText": "It's my first time going to Europe so I'm making a bit of a thing of it, with 41 days on this leg of the journey. I want to make sure that I'm not missing any major destinations, that there's a reasonable amount of time allotted for travel etc. I'm a late 20s male, open to a bit of partying but don't want that to define the trip. I'm more looking for inexpensive, amazing cultural experiences. Hikes are a low priority for me and food is far more important.\n\n* I'm missing out on Romania and Bulgaria. Is it worth shaving time somewhere to make time for that? \n* It feels like a lot of time in Bologna, Florence and Rome. Is there another place I should be going instead? How much cheaper is Southern Italy? \n* Any Hostels or activities you loved in these places?\n\n18th September - 29th October\n \n* Prague, Czechia(5 nights) - Flying in from Porto. Destination can be changed.\n* Vienna, Austria(3 nights)\n* Munich, Germany(3 nights) - midweek for Oktoberfest\n* Budapest, Hungary(5 nights)\n* Belgrade, Serbia(2 nights)\n* Sarajevo, Bosnia(3 nights)\n* Dubrovnik, Croatia(2 nights)\n* Split, Croatia (3 nights)\n* Bologna, Italy(4 nights) - Ferry across to Ancona then bus\n* Florence, Italy(4 nights)\n* Rome, Italy(5 nights)\n\nThank you in advance for any help! I'm so excited.",

The scenery around the town is amazing, and you can take a cable car up and see some of the most beautiful mountains in Europe with almost no effort. I would just steal a day from what you have planned in Vienna to do it\u2014 I personally think Vienna is a a fine city but boring compared to the others on your list (unless you\u2019re really into classical music).",

Travel days can be very exhausting and time consuming. I would suggest cutting out 4-5 places and spending more time in places you are really interested in.",

    "postText": "Sharing my experience as it didn\u2019t even cross my mind I should be on the lookout for this. \n\nMy phone was stolen in Oaxaca, Mexico this week. I opted to take a taxi vs. walking since it was after dark and I was a woman traveling solo. Since I was off the street, I pulled my phone out and was sending a text. \n\nBefore I was even able to process, someone off the sidewalk had reached into the taxi through the window, grabbed my phone out of my hands, and run off with it. \n\nLooking back now, it\u2019s obviously a very smart opportunity for theft and I should\u2019ve been smarter. Just wanted to post my experience to remind others of the possibility!\n\nAlso was warned by hostels of an increase in armed robberies in Oaxaca as of late, so be mindful of that when travel planning!",

Likelihood of that is extremely low, depends on the user having their phone out in the hand next to the window, not closing the window and not fighting back. Car will still be stopped while person reacts and most would want to call the police causing further issues. Then once you add in he booked it via and app and its now practically impossible as he doesnt know where the pick up will be until he is already heading there\n\nThis BS attitude is what brings things down and makes people pay attention to the wrong things. Stop blaming other innocent bystandards and focus on a) the thief and b) see what security habits you can adopt (not victim blaming here at all, but lets be real, anything we can do to improve our situation is a win)",

I have a wrist strap and 1 reason I'm wary to use it is cuz I hate carrying things and would rather have my phone in my pocket or fanny pack and pull it out only when I need it for directions or photos. Having a string connected to my wrist and hanging into my bag or pocket feels like a recipe for getting tangled.\n\nAlso my hiking pants only have 1 loop thingy on the left side, no belt loop or anything to hook it to on the right side. And I use my phone most often with my right hand \ud83d\ude43 also the zip pocket for my phone is on the right side, so unfortunately poor design does not allow for me to use a belt loop AND put it in the pocket when I'm not using it. \n\nI can use a neck lanyard, but then there's the problem again of always having my phone visible like a target. Also the weight of my phone will absolutely hurt my neck. Just wearing my sunnies around my neck is enough to make my neck sore after a few hours.",

But that wrist strap is thick and clunky, it's a sort of slinky type wire idk how to explain it lol. But it can clip to a belt loop or something, which could take a thief 1 second to unclip and is very visible. The sticky loopie sticks to the inside of the case or the back of the phone itself, but I don't think my case is easy to remove, at least for me it takes a bit of pulling. I hadn't stuck the loopie to the phone itself cuz I don't want the phone to get icky when I do remove it \ud83d\ude33",

Real damn quick just to get through the crowd. And when we find a place where we wanna hang at I realize my phone was gone. It happened so fast just like you described",

I'd bet the difference between AC or none could mess with your finances if you live in a hot climate and are doing gig work jobs. Uber certainly isn't going to pay them extra for having AC. Just my best guess, I don't live in a hot climate.",

Then from another angle, someone else saw the dealer snuck a photo of their customer. \n\nA few hours later, cops saw the customer walking and without consent, they handcuffed him, and searched their pockets to find the drugs. The only way for them to prevent jail is paying the cops a few hundred USD. \n\nObviously you should never buy drugs in the first place but they aren't any better being crooks for more money.",

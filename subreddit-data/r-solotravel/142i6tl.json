    "postText": "Hi all, I have put together a very early itinerary and I am looking at big picture suggestions on the destinations, lenghts of time, travel between places etc and also more detailed suggestions of things to do in these places!\n\nIn terms of travel interests, I really want to experience the culture, especially the food (and drink!) of the region, I'd like to eat as the locals do as much as possible but maybe have a few finer dining experiences. I am interested in the history of Cambodia, particularly from the colonial period to present and so colonial influenced architecture/culture also would be on the radar. I also want to travel where practical by train/boat -&gt; have a bit of a Heart of Darkness/Orient Express itch I like to scratch on holidays. I also want to have a period on the trip (probably the end) where I am mostly sitting somewhere nice (a beach probably), relaxing, eating/drinking and reading.\n\nDay 1 Arrive Siem Riep, explore town (old market)\n\nDay 2 Angkor Wat and War Museum\n\nDay 3 Landmine Museum and more exploring\n\nDay 4 Travel by boat to Battambang (whats the latest opinion on the boat? Threads seem mixed)\n\nDay 5 Walking Tour and Exploration  \n\nDay 6 Travel by bus or train(?) to Phnom Penh\n\nDay 7 S-21 Museum and Royal Palace (I have left off the killing fields, I am not sure I want to see it. I know it's horrific I don't need to see that ... but if people want to convince me go for it)\n\nDay 8 Explore town, market, walking tour etc\n\nDay 9 Travel by train to Kampot\n\nDay 10 Pepper plantation\n\nDay 11 Wat Ey Sey and/or Veal Pouch Waterfall\n\nDay 12 Travel by Crab Shuttle(?) to Kep\n\nDay 13 Literally nothing but relax\n\nDay 14 Literally nothing but relax\n\nDay 15 Travel by bus to Phnom Penh, depart\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts on the itinerary? Is it too rushed? I am wondering if the diversion to Battambang is necessary.\n\nPlus recommendations appreciated in particular for homestays, guides, tours etc that blew you away!",

            "comment": "You definitely need at least two full days for Angkor Wat (and although it's a very popular activity and quite crowded, I still recommend going for the sunrise on one of those days). I also recommend doing the Angkor National Museum first, the day before you start Angkor Wat, as it provides some good context.\nAs others have said, food in Cambodia isn't as impressive as the rest of the region, but there are a few great restaurants in Siem Reap: Fresh Fruit Factory (their ice mountains are such a perfect way to cool off and soooo delicious... and the eggs benedict pancakes are incredible, plus the Japanese couple that owns it is just beyond lovely), Pou Restaurant, Mahob Cuisine, Olive Cuisine de Saison...\nThe thing I hate about Siem Reap is Pub Street. It's my idea of hell. \n\nPhnom Penh is a city that seems to get mixed reviews. Most people I know don't care for it, but I quite love it. And while the Tuol Sleng Prison and Choeung Ek Killing Fields were the most devastating places I've ever visited (and I do a lot of so-called \"dark tourism:\" https://www.dontfollowmetravel.com/blog/facing-down-humanitys-demons-6-dark-tourism-sites-worth-visiting), I do think they're worth your while.\n\n*Edit: a tip for Angkor Wat: go to the ticket office the day before your visit, in the late afternoon, and purchase your ticket then. You'll save time and avoid the crowds.",

I\u2019m also a professional chef and I too try to \u201ceat as the locals do\u201d and experience the culture through food when I travel. \n\nLet me tell you that Cambodia had the WORST food of anywhere we travelled in the region. Here\u2019s the problem, as I see it. The Khmer Rouge killed off many of the elderly, which is why Cambodia now has one of the youngest populations in the world. Who knows how to cook traditional recipes? The grandmas. You see where I\u2019m going with this?\n\nCambodia was fascinating and we definitely don\u2019t regret going. But food wise we found that there isn\u2019t much traditional food left and it\u2019s mostly just foreign stuff and copycat Thai or Vietnamese dishes. \n\nNow for your itinerary, if you want to relax I\u2019d check out Koh Rong Samolem. Beautiful island and way more chill than the bigger Koh Rong which is more of a backpacker party island. We stayed at a lovely guesthouse in M\u2019Pay Bay run by some Aussie expats and had a lovely time. Kampot and Kep was probably my favorite spot in Cambodia. The crab market in Kep is amazing and Kampot has a really cool vibe. Rent a motorbike and drive up Bokor Mountain while you\u2019re there. You can also just drive yourself to Kep and skip the \u201ccrab shuttle\u201d. Motorbike rentals are cheap and easy to get, and then you\u2019re free to go wherever you want.\n\nAngkor Wat you need more than one day. If all you want is to take a picture with the main temple for the \u2018gram then one day is fine, but if you actually want to see Angkor Wat you\u2019re gonna need more time. We did a 3-day private tour with u/TrustyTukTuk and it was incredible and very reasonably priced. SokLy was amazing and we would have missed out on so much without him. Don\u2019t skimp on this, trust me. Save time in other parts of your itinerary (for example by renting a motorbike in Kampot you can drive to a pepper plantation, tour it, then drive to Kep, eat Green Pepper Crab, and drive back to Kampot all in one day.) Battambang you only need one night, there\u2019s nothing of interest in that town other than an awesome gemstone market selling the locally mined Cambodian Zircon. \n\nAlso, yes, the S21 prison and Killing Fields are depressing AF. Still, go see them. It\u2019s a huge part of what makes Cambodian culture what it is today, and important to bear witness to human atrocities to ensure they don\u2019t happen again. \n\nSorry for the long post but hopefully it was helpful and feel free to message me with questions.",

You see where I\u2019m going with this?\n\nI think your conclusion is right (Cambodian food pales in comparison to Thai and Vietnamese) but you're mistaken in your reasoning.   The Khmer Rouge, for all the horrors they created, was only in power four years.   While 20% of the population was killed off, it was predominately men (33% vs about 15% of women).\n\nTheir food culture survived.  However, both Thailand and Vietnam went through a food renaissance in the late 90s, early 2000s.    Thailand, in fact, began what became called [gastrodiplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culinary_diplomacy).   Regional dishes were modernized and standardized with the intention of appealing to the western pallet and attracting tourists based on their food.  It was incredibly successful.  Many of the Thai and Vietnamese dishes everyone loves are modern takes on traditional food, used for marketing.\n\nCambodia, however, was still recovering from years of wars and genocide and didn't get in on the action.  \n\nAs a tourist, you're not usually going to encounter authentic high-quality Cambodian food.    Street food is made to be really cheap; about $0.75-$1.25 a portion.  It involves a lot of processed meat and is made for a snack or just a quick meal. Most restaurants cater to tourists and offer really basic cuisine that no Cambodian would make at home.  Cambodian restaurants that don't cater to tourists (you can recognize them because they'll have a dozen pots out front and you look in them and pick what you want) are really basic simple food because, again, Cambodian who are eating out don't have a lot of money to spend.   There just aren't a lot of restaurants that serve traditional home-cooked Cambodian food.   Most tourists will try Lok Lak - a Cambodian take on a dish that was invented in Vietnam for the French.   Amok, a Cambodian curry, is about the only dish that they've tried to promote to tourists.\n\nYou need to really get into a Cambodian's home who will make you [something special](https://imgur.com/a/y0Ydr8I), or attend a Buddhist ceremony at a temple where all the locals [bring out all the best food they can](https://imgur.com/a/8Ax0gPk) to offer to the monks. \n\nThey really do have great food. As a tourist, it's not easy to find and it's not as sophisticated as what you'll find in Thailand and Vietnam, but it's really worth it if you get the chance.",

I went to S-21 first and then the fields straight after. Don\u2019t have to be there for ages. I think S-21 may have been worse in some ways. \n\nAgree with everyone else that you need more time at Angkor wat, it\u2019s very hard to explain just how immense just that one is, but the region is dotted with amazing sites that all have different styles.",

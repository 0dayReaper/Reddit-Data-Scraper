Not only will you have freezing temperatures and snow to contend with (roads being closed etc) you will also have a lot less daylight. Some of the desert parks near Vegas should be accessible around that time of year however. Death Valley maybe? Great park to explore and too hot most of the year but December will be perfect.",

And I really hate to burst your bubble, but if you don't already have tickets and accommodations planned for Disney World the week between Christmas and New Years, you're too late. It's the busiest week of the year, and the most expensive. Most hotels will already be booked, and the ones that are not will be getting more expensive by the day. \n\nYou need major, major planning to try to go to Disney World that week, it's not the type of thing where you can just pop in for a day and ride some rides. I used to be a certified Disney trip planner, and my family has gone that week many times, and I would never recommend a person new to Disney World going that week. You just won't get out of it what you want, and you'll end up wasting a lot of money and being very disappointed.",

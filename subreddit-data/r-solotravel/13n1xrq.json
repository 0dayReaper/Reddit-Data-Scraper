    "postText": "Hello all,\n\n(27M) Currently on my first solo trip to France and Spain. Got into Paris last night, leaving for Cannes tomorrow then Barcelona the week after that. \n\nFirst off let me say I absolutely love Paris. I have heard they can be rude to tourists or that they can generally be somewhat closed off. In my first two days here I have had nothing but awesome interactions with almost everybody. From waiters/waitresses to patrons at cafes around me I have already met some amazing people. \n\nThe language barrier has also been a complete non issue. My French is VERY limited but I always start off every interaction with whoever I am speaking with in French. After all I am a guest in their country the least I can do is make the attempt before they realize how shit my French is \ud83e\udd23. I have also found that poking fun at myself and apologizing for being a dumb American has seemed to break the ice in those situations. Even where there is been a waiter who has no English in their vocabulary there is enough resources available now a days that we have been able to figure it out. Just be nice to people, no matter the language. \n\nJust wanted to share my experience so far on the sub since reading similar solo trips gave me the confidence to take my first solo trip, and maybe I can help someone else do the same, cheers!",

Most people who were French were nice and helpful if I tried to speak their language or greet them before switching to English.\n\nThe only rude people I encountered were other tourists. Other tourists are pretty rude in Paris at times, depending on the sights you're located at.",

Although I was in awe of the place all the time and didn't try to meet people specifically but whenever I needed some info or support, I found both kind of people - ones who helped me and ones who didn't (or couldn't hence I give them benefit of doubt). And that happens in our own countries as well.",

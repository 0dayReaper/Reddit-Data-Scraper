    "postText": "It\u2019s my first full day in London after flying in yesterday after 24hrs travel time. I was super jet lagged last night and have woken this morning feeling super lethargic and feel like I can\u2019t really be bothered doing anything. Is this a common experience after long flights? \n\nI\u2019m going to get up and go get a coffee etc but right now I would be content just lying here with my eyes closed. \n\nI just wonder if other people feel guilty for feeling like doing nothing. I\u2019m also feeling overwhelmed at the idea of three months of moving around right now, but am hoping it\u2019s just because I\u2019m still so tired.\n\nUPDATE: thanks for all the kind replies, I actually went back to sleep after posting that and slept for another five hours and then woke and did heaps this afternoon. I think I was genuinely just exhausted. Need to be kinder to myself I think.",

I was supposed to get on a train to Liverpool but a strike ensured that didn't happen. Coaches were booked, so i had to get a room for the night. I went and got dinner, got back to my room and racked out before 7pm. 0 guilt. I was exhausted, I only got 2 hours of sleep on my flight and I had to navigate transportation obstacles in a country I'd never been to. I assed out until midnight, then again from 1am until 4am. I also knew London was just temporary, not my main objective, so again, no guilt. I was there because I had to be. Then I took a 6+ hour bus ride to liverpool today. \n\nThe point is, active travel is taxing. You're here to enjoy yourself, take the time to recoup and get adjusted, so you can really be in the moment and enjoy yourself. Idk about you, but if I'm severely sleep deprived I'm not enjoying things like I do when I'm rested.",

Usually, by the next day, I am pretty much on local time, but not always, so I make sure that my first full day anywhere is an easy day.  \n\nHowever, I recently took a trip to Belize and Guatemala (not a solo trip, but still applies) and for the first full day there, I planned to do almost nothing and it was GLORIOUS.  We stayed in a small town on the beach, so it was an easy place to do nothing there - lol.  Our whole plan for the day was to walk around town and then hang out on the beach.  I had found a coffee place online that was about a 30 minute walk from our lodging, so we walked to coffee, hung out and had a couple of coffees and some pastry while we read our books, then walked back using a different route, stopping at whatever we found of interest on the way, marking it on Google maps for later.  The rest of the day, we wandered along the beach, found some beach bars, went swimming, got some food... I am now a convert to doing a whole lot of nothing on the first day of trips now.",

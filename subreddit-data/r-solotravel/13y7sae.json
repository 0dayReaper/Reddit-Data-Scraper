    "postText": "Hello! I'm 23F and planning to backpack Indonesia solo next month. In the middle of planning my route and I know loosely where I want to go and do but am looking for some critique on my planned route and the best ways of transit between them. I'm debating travelling more within the country and going through the visa extension, but not sure if it's worth it. I'm not in too much of a rush to go through everything and like some chill travel days. Thanks!\n\n**Day 1-4: Yogyakarta**\n\nDay 5: Travel to Probolinggo (best place to base myself for Mt. Bromo?)\n\n**Day 6-7: Mount Bromo Hike**\n\nDay 8: Travel to Banyuwangi \n\n**Day 9-10: Ijen Crater**\n\nDay 11: Travel to Bali\n\n**Day 12-20: Bali (thinking of mainly Ubud, Uluwatu),** *do VISA extension here?*\n\nDay 21-23: **Gili Islands**\n\nDay 24: Back to Bali (plane to Labuan Bajo)?\n\n* I'm really interested in doing a Komodo Islands Tour, and thinking I'll book there with a hostel. \n\n**Day 25-28: Labuan Bajo &amp; Komodo National Park**\n\nThis would be my plan for 30 days with 2 day buffer to leave Indonesia, but I'm also debating if it's worth it to extend the visa and also travel to Lombok, spend more days on the Gili islands, and Flores. I've solo travelled Vietnam before and will be staying in hostels and hopefully meeting new people, would love to hear some experiences about that in parts of Indonesia other than Bali as well.",

            "comment": "Hey I went to Mount Ijen and bali in the last few weeks! I'd highly recommend leaving very early for the hike if you'd like to see sunrise. Bring 100k idr to have the miners take you down to the sulfur mine, it's worth it (dont go down by yourself it upsets them).\n\nUbud is pretty busy so I'd recommend going to touristy spots early. I'd recommend getting an app for the taxi service MyBlueBird or Grab they are pretty cheap and reliable. Random taxis are significantly more expensive. If you want some suggestions around Bali send me a message.",

            "comment": "Sounds doable, but some suggestions:\n\n* Instead of Probolinggo, travel onward to Cemoro Lawang which is the crater-side village of Bromo. Also do check up on what two full days of hiking around Bromo will entail - it is very beautiful, yes, but not very expansive.\n* Ijen might require another day or two. Again, check up with the hiking guide.\n* Bali sounds fine. Uluwatu is the priciest part of the island though and a pain to taxi to/from. You'll find most hostels around the Kuta/Legian/Seminyak/Canggu belt. The area is busy, but also very convenient given its access to great restaurants, clubs, tour shops etc. Ubud is convenient as well, and arguably a lot nicer for tourists than the seaside.\n* Gili is beautiful but I found it to be a bit of a tourist ghetto. I won't return next time I go to Indo, the country has far nicer places. I'd instead stick to mainland Lombok and do the absolutely stunning sunrise trek up Mount Rinjani (I preferred that over Ijen, honestly).\n* Komodo is an experience for sure! If you can afford it, a liveaboard will be great for a few days, or you can just do a day cruise (bargain hard at the dockside agents). Either way, the island landscape over here is stunning.\n* In terms of your itinerary, it makes sense to end your trip in Bali as it'll give you the easiest flight connections back home. Likewise, you'll probably find it cheaper to start in Jakarta and head down to Jogja (Yogyakarta) by train/domestic flight. Jakarta isn't the most beautiful city around, but it's got a vibe worth checking out for a day or two.\n\nI did a similar trip a few years ago - Jakarta to Yogyakarta (for Borobudur and Prambanan) to Surabaya (for a midnight-sunrise tour of Bromo and Madakaripura Waterfalls) to Labuan Bajo (for a day cruise through Komodo) to Bali (Ubud and Seminyak). I took two weeks for it all, taking trains from Jakarta to Yogyakarta to Surabaya, and domestic flights from Surabaya to Labuan Bajo and Labuan Bajo to Bali. You have 30 days, which would be more than sufficient to take things more gently.",

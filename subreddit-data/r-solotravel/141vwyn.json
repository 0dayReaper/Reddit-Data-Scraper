I\u2019m looking for somewhere with a party scene but also somewhere with stuff to do and explore during the day\n\nI\u2019ll be on vacation from august 5th to august 19th. \n\nFrom what I can tell  Berlin, Prague, Barcelona, Amsterdam are all great locations. I would love to not spend a lot do Ibiza is probably out. \n\n\n\nI am honestly the worst person to make decisions. This is torture trying to find somewhere with a great nightlife scene and also not overly expensive",

The nightlife also has unique aspects like bath parties, ruin bars and boats parties, and prices are reasonable compared \nto other destinations. I'd second Barcelona too, great nightlife \u2013 these would probably be the top 2 for me",

Berlin\u2019s is too cool for school, very queer, and obviously very techno-centric. Budapest has much more nightlife catering to tourists and rowdy groups, which sounds terrible but\u2014I hate to admit\u2014is really fun if you\u2019re part of a rowdy group of tourists from your party hostel.",

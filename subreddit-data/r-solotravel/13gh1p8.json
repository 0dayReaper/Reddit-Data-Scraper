    "postText": "I broke up with my situationship partner nine months ago, we used to travel a lot together and always had a good time. I still think about him and now I found myself not enjoy traveling alone anymore. I constantly feel lonely and anxious. I go to one site and take pictures putting on Instagram to show people how happy I am. Do I really happy? No I feel empty and waste of my money to see these views without sharing with my love one. I used to travel alone a lot but I also drank a lot to avoid the feeling of loneliness and I don't want to do that anymore. I have been in Australia for nine months and ready to head home now. I thought I would move on from him after this working holiday, but apparently I didn't. I just get more confused and lonely..",

            "comment": "I get it. I lost my travel buddy of 6 years. My first solo trip was great because i pampered myself (went to a spa, shopped, stayed in a nice hotel, etc) and felt totally relaxed. My next solo trip was more lonely and made me miss him really bad. I know he's been solo travelling too and probably feeling the same void unless he's replaced me lol. It takes time to get used to not having someone that was there.\n\nIts okay to go home and heal. Take time. Lonliness comes in waves and sometimes doing activities you did together will trigger memories and make it harder. If you do decide to travel solo again, pick something completely different than you did with him, and treat yourself. Short solo trips are also better IMO.",

I guess I love traveling alone, and with someone who would not mind if I asked for an alone time to wander.\n\nI guess in your case you might be broken hearted and is in a not so familiar place, and 9 months is long to be dealing with a sudden change. I am so sorry you have to go through that.. it isn't bad to take a break for yourself.. then decide (in time) maybe you could travel solo, happily again",

Certainly, travelling on your own is a different, quieter experience of travel. \n\nThe way I have tackled the feeling of wanting to share my experiences and having no one to share them with is to bring a sketchbook and sketch the places I visit. This gives me time to sit and enjoy the place rather than just rushing on. And my friends/family back home are way more interested in seeing my sketchbook than my photos. So I get a chance to share my experience that way.",

And if you are not whole yourself, no relationship will be very successful.\n\nBeing comfortable with yourself (and *by* yourself) takes work, and time. Consider starting your self-work with a journal and 'daily pages', and maybe look into counseling or various types of therapy to help you befriend yourself (art therapy and dance therapy can be very fun, for example).\n\nA well-learned meditation practice (as you'd find at a Zen or sometimes a yoga studio) is also excellent for coming to terms with aloneness -- its yearning and its rich, intimate depth -- and for quieting the tormenting thoughts that otherwise kidnap you and control your moods.",

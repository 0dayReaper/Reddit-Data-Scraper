    "postText": "Context if it matters: (30M) 6'1 white male from the United States am solo traveling to Colombia in three weeks.\n\nThis will be my first time traveling to a different country by myself. I don't speak Spanish and am downloading babble in order to help me learn some travelling language to get by while I'm there.\n\nDon't have an itinerary made yet (I know lol) but I am flying into Bogota and plan on spending half my time there and the other half in Medellin. My duration is 10 days.\n\nI really don't know exactly what I want to do there but a few things come in mind: Go white water rafting or some water activity, visit the best restaurants, experience the nightlife, make several friends there to fully appreciate the culture, and possibly visit some attractions/museums.\n\nDoing the safety research for the last few weeks, I've learned the below (any input is appreciated from people recently been to Colombia)\n\n\\- Don't wear flashy clothes\n\n\\- Don't flash phone or any other valuables\n\n\\- Keep ID and passport in secure locker, create copies to carry around with\n\n\\- Take uber over taxis\n\n\\- Watch drink at all times, don't accept drinks from someone you don't know\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny tips/recommendations on fun activities or sound advice are welcomed. I am nervous, but in a good way!",

A lot of stuff to do, good parties and just a good vibe. \nMy experience with safety is actually super positive in Colombia - just don\u2019t do stuff like taking our your phone (especially at a traffic light - motorbikes will pass you and grab it). Don\u2019t be alone at night - especially not drunk. Take Ubers. \n\nOther tips: use the app ATM Fee Saver. It shows you the banks close by with no fees for withdrawal cash :)\n\nDownload SpanishDict \u2026 my Spanish is a mess and the translation of this app is really good, so communication is easier :)",

Super friendly and helpful, plus they did a great job of facilitating events. Speaking of events, there\u2019s always something happening at the hostel. Super easy to meet people, both during the day and nighttime activities. Rooftops are great, they\u2019ve got a pool in one of the buildings, the dorms and washrooms were super clean. \n\nOnly downside, and this one is so insignificant but I\u2019ll mention it anyway: there are two separate buildings, which is slightly annoying if you go to the other one and you forgot something in your dorm. However, they\u2019re less than a minute apart, and ultimately it never bothered me. \n\nDamn, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever written that much about a hostel. Just go to Los Patios, you won\u2019t regret it!",

I\u2019d also put it in my top5. Social, good location, clean.\n\nMy brother who I mentioned went and he came back saying hey hostels are pretty cool I might try those next time lol. Just because he hung out at LP with some people he apparently met. Anyway a hostel is a hostel you\u2019re sharing a bed and bathroom with strangers it\u2019s not the lap of luxury, so its funny for us to hype it up this much, but you can find yourself a surprisingly good time at the right one at the right time.",

Please try to visit Cartagena instead. You\u2019d love it!\n\nAlso Colombia is not nearly a quarter as dangerous as people make it out to be. I felt super safe.

From what I heard, you always want to pre arrange a taxi ahead of time because there are taxi drivers who will rip you off or worse if you take them, so make sure your taxis is arranged through a legit company.

I spend a month or two every couple years in Bogot\u00e1 but live in Medell\u00edn. I wonder if things have changed - seems like all those kids take off from the area now when they finish up and never was aware of it being a big night life area around the Uni. \n\nI only would go down at night to La Candelaria for orchestra / special events and even getting an Uber or taxi after was incredibly difficult. I remember a couple situations it was raining and literally impossible :/",

Also met a taxi driver that more than earn't my trust so I would just give him a call when I needed a ride. Sometimes things go your way and sometimes they don't.\n\nIt was funny the owners of the hospedaje warned us about walking up Monserrate, so they sent their two early teen sons with us to keep us safe. No teenage bodyguards for walking around after dark though. Haha.\n\nBut no doubt things can change and even though it's great to have many different perspectives and stories, I totally agree somebody who lives in Bogot\u00e1 and visits La Candelaria regularly will have the best insight. \n\nOn another note, the bars near the Uni in Medell\u00edn use to be a great night spot too. I never see people talk about it on here though so no idea if that is still a thing?",

It's near Universidad de Antioquia on Calle 66a. I never saw the appeal of Poblado but I enjoyed la 70. Although most of my friends in Medell\u00edn definitely didn't have the money for private education. Hence why I ended up in places like Calle 66 where you could easily bring a box of rum and have a good time out on the street with everyone for very little money.",

During the day, I probably don't pay much attention to how I use it. When it's night I might duck into the entry of a store or at least alcove while I check/use it. When in doubt order an Uber or hop in a taxi.\n\nChapinero does have a more urban urban, slightly rough around the edges feeling despite it being an expensive neighborhood vs the more northern neighborhoods. Try to walk where there are bars, restaurants and life at night if you're ever in doubt just pay an Uber or taxi, especially late if the businesses are closed / streets are empty.\n\nI am not sure on gringo entertainment tbh - I would suggest checking the expat FB groups for events or recommendations maybe. I usually follow local art / culture type stuff, go to restaurants or whatever with my girlfriend.",

Bogota bike tours does a really fun bicycle tour around the city with interesting history and food stops. \n\nLa Chorrera is probably one of the most unique hikes I\u2019ve been on, you hike through a mountain farm village into a cloud forest then up to a water fall and it only takes a few hours. There\u2019s tons of dogs and cows and other animals and just really unique \n\nAlso, make sure you fill out the CheckMig form before you leave. They may not check it in Colombia but they probably will at your home airport at check in. If you need help figuring the checkmig form(it\u2019s infamously bad tech) dm me",

You can use Google translate to communicate with locals in a pinch, and also to translate any menus or written materials via the camera option \n- do the free walking tour in bogota \n- do the comu\u00f1a 13 tour in Medell\u00edn also \n(I used to think tours were lame but walking tours led by locals have always been awesome experiences to me in South American countries) \n- in general consider local guides, especially if you want to take a day trip, a popular one from Medellin is guatape.

The locals did like to remind us to be careful, but we\u2019re from a major city and with street smarts and common sense you should be fine. Everyone we encountered was warm and lovely. Our Spanish is pretty terrible, google translate saved us many times. \n\nDefinitely visit Monserrate, the gondola is a fun way to get to the top. We went at sunset and would highly recommend. I also loved the graffiti tour in La Candelaria - if you do it on the first or second day it will really help you get your confidence up. Chorro de Quevedo square is a fun place to hangout, people watch, and drink the local chicha. Not sure if you\u2019re into high end dining, but El Chato was incredible and would have easily been $500 in the states. \n\nHave fun! Colombia is gorgeous and I can\u2019t wait to go back!",

Why only two in Bogota if you don't me asking? \n\nI plan on downloading a translator and I also feel like 3 weeks worth of training everyday will be better than no training.\n\nDon't plan on going on tinder. This isn't to brag but I am an attractive guy so my plan was to just meet woman in person if it feels right. \n\nI have AT&amp;T international so do I still need the claro sim?\n\nThanks for the additional tips!

If you go on a weekend you'll meet tons of people from Medell\u00edn out partying for the weekend.\n\nGlad to hear you're a confident and attractive man. You'll do just fine, the girls out there are so kind and gorgeous.\n\nAT&amp;T international should do just fine! No need to get a sim.",

I walked the streets when it got dark, I would have been fine wearing flashy clothing, had my phone out the entire time, etc. \n\nJust use common sense and know the environment your in. If your on a bus - just know someone is seeing if you will be dumb and leave your bad somewhere they can grab. If your on the street - don\u2019t have your phone out looking confused like a tourist. Don\u2019t leave your bag and phone at the beach while your in the water. If your in a nasty dirty area - don\u2019t hang out there too long.\n\nI would say a great tip is when you go out - only bring the amount you plan to use or willing to lose. If I was walking late at night and didn\u2019t need my phone, I would just leave it in the safe at the hotel.",

Guatap\u00e9 is around a series of lakes and has a lot of water activities.\n\nDownload a translator on your phone to talk to people cause 3 weeks of babble isn't going to help at all unless you're a polyglot picking up a 7th language.\n\nNo phone out in the streets, only carry around some cash and a credit card, and always be ready to hand over your shit in the unlikely chance someone attempts to rob you. Your phone is worth nothing compared to your life.\n\nDon't go on tinder, but introduce yourself to women you see at bars. They're usually very much into \"gringos\" and will find you irresistible if you practice basic Spanish with them in a light-hearted way.\n\nAlso get a claro SIM card for your phone so you can have data during your stay. Should cost you like $3-$5 USD.\n\nLastly, enjoy! You're gonna have so much fun.\n\nIf you like salsa, reggaeton, and big booty latinas, definitely go to Carrera 70 in Laureles, which can seem intimidating to a first-timer but I can guarantee it's safer than poblado.",

Guatap\u00e9 is around a series of lakes and has a lot of water activities.\n\nDownload a translator on your phone to talk to people cause 3 weeks of babble isn't going to help at all unless you're a polyglot picking up a 7th language.\n\nNo phone out in the streets, only carry around some cash and a credit card, and always be ready to hand over your shit in the unlikely chance someone attempts to rob you. Your phone is worth nothing compared to your life.\n\nDon't go on tinder, but introduce yourself to women you see at bars. They're usually very much into \"gringos\" and will find you irresistible if you practice basic Spanish with them in a light-hearted way.\n\nAlso get a claro SIM card for your phone so you can have data during your stay. Should cost you like $3-$5 USD.\n\nLastly, enjoy! You're gonna have so much fun.\n\nIf you like salsa, reggaeton, and big booty latinas, definitely go to Carrera 70 in Laureles, which can seem intimidating to a first-timer but I can guarantee it's safer than poblado.",

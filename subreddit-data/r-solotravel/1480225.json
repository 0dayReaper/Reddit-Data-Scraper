    "postText": "Hello- I've heard that not all the elephant sanctuaries that claim to be ethical, actually are ethical.  I want to go to Thailand and help at an elephant sanctuary that does not force it's elephants to interact, but rather, gives them a choice and lets them roam freely.I have never flown on a plane before or left my home area. my ignorance is vast... I would like the name of a tour company that arranges small tours for people like me who want to do this and not become part of the problem. Has anyone reading this any experience that was really positive  so that they might be able to reccommend a tour company or something?\n\nthank you very much!                                                                                                                                             Wow- so much positivity and information! thank you all so much, I am going to research everything. i am grateful to you all. I am so thrilled to plan this trip!",

I spent a few weeks looking after dogs there as part of a programme, and every morning I'd see elephants being escorted put of their adequately sized pens to have breakfast and to roam around until the night. Of course you can't get too up close to the elephants but you can feed them fresh produce and take baths with them depending on what you are looking for.\n\nhttps://www.elephantnaturepark.org/enp/visit-volunteer\n\nDefinetly look into it!",

I volunteered there in 2019 and it was lovely.\n\nMinimal interaction, all the elephants have their own keeper whom they \u201cchoose\u201d for themselves, the only contact is a very controlled feeding sessions where you literally just hand the ellys some snacks from behind a barrier - no petting, playing, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s also very much a rehabilitative facility so there\u2019s hydrotherapy pools, a lot of the animals are a bit older or disabled, and there\u2019s a real focus on giving them the most natural life they can be afforded. \n\nTbh I think it\u2019s actually a more impactful and memorable experience seeing these animals in their natural state rather than in some kind of performative interaction. Something about being looked right in the eye by an elephant stays with you forever. They have so much wisdom and emotion in their eyes, it\u2019s incredible.",

It was important to me as well to go to an ethical,  real sanctuary when I was in Thailand. I was there in 2018 and they are a true sanctuary.  We were able to get near certain elephants for pictures, but not able to interact with babies or really do anything with the elephants other than feed them bananas in one certain area.  It was an amazing experience.  They really do amazing work (check out Save Elephant Foundation or ENP on Instagram). There's also rescued dogs,  cats,  and water Buffalo on the property.  It also comes with a delicious vegetarian buffet lunch as well.",

So all of the elephants in any given sanctuary were likely trained to be docile using force when they were younger. That's why they are so chill around humans. It also means that they cannot safely reintegrate into the wild or survive on their own too easily. Similar to the situation with wolves and other prey animals in the USA, elephants can be seen as a danger to local people. They can destroy homes and farms and businesses in rural areas.   \n  \nIDK that's what they say at the elephant rescue park in chiang mai and it seems like a reasonable explanation. I didn't see any active coercion while I was there, but it's possible they get \"trained\" when there are no tourists around. hard to say.",

Ultimately the \u201cbest\u201d of them seemed to still breed elephants into captivity.\n\nThe only one that seemed to make the cut was one in Cambodia where the elephants were more or less re-wilded into a forest and only controlled to be kept out of nearby farms. Tourists paid a guide to hike out and watch them. Since they were raised domesticated you could approach them safely and feed them bananas and pet them as long as they were interested in you, but otherwise the elephants did what they wanted and we were there to just observe them.",

Everything has a price tag, and it is clear that they are all trying to appeal to as many tourists as possible.\n\nEven facilities that don't allow tourists to bathe with the elephants (which I believe is totally unethical) still allow interaction you won't find in other places.\n\nFor comparison, I'd point to Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in Kenya. When you visit, you are just an observer; direct interaction with the elephants like you have in Thailand is not allowed.\n\nIt's hard to consider any facility in Thailand \"ethical\" once you've seen world-class facilities outside of Thailand.",

They do some tours to waterfalls and things like that or where you can meet people from the Karen tribe and it's really just a wonderful place to stay.\n\nI loved elephant happy hour where if you bought two drinks they gave you a tray of bananas that you could feed to the elephants who knew exactly when elephant happy hour was and kind of congregated around the deck where it was happening.

Then you stayed on a cabin on a lake which was amazing.  It\u2019s still something you want to be super careful about, as it may have changed since I was there pre-Covid , but it was very good then. It\u2019s a business for profit but they were aware the elephants well being mattered to their income.",

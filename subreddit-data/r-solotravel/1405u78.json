Most of the cetacean watching cruises just sold tickets for you to join, too. I did join a tour to explore the lava tube \"Cueva del Viento\" since there was no other option than the guided group tour.",

Like im just going there to constantly fight off feeling jealous and redirecting my emotions to how cool it is that I can afford this\n\nWhat do you think? Have you ever felt this way, I feel like its just better to completely isolate myself instead than seeing super happy closed off people that dont care at all for outsiders",

Can honestly be done in 5 days.\n\nSolo travelling,  excursions are usually alot of couples and groups, but I have usually made friends with people.\n\nI also make sure that when I am on excursions and I see solo people , I chat to them as I know what it's like so I think there's many people who think like this too.\n\nFrom what you are saying I totally understand but I think it would actually be good for you to go there knowing you may feel these things, but not to act on them. Sit in the uncomfortable and force yourself to make the experience what you want.\nI suffered from crippling anxiety and agoraphobia and just said fuck it as I had enough of feeling scared of the world and super alone.\n\nSolo travelling made me really learn how to be okay with being by myself. \nI only had myself to rely on to get fed, not be bored , find things to do, and ask for help.",

It's easier said than done, but I wasted so many years not doing things because I went through all the worst scenarios whilst actively doing nothing.\n\nIf you wanna chat, send me a message, and I can send you some places I've been as a solo traveller, the excursions I booked, and the feelings that came along with it.",

    "postText": "I'm doing a 10 days solo trip to norway in june, and i'd appreciate your thoughts and comments.\n\n \n\n**Oslo:** 4 days (I know this is alot for oslo but unfortunately the day of arrival has the cheapest flight of the week, and i have something planned for Day 4 in oslo) i might make a trip to the beach on one of those days.\n\n**That leaves 6 days for the rest, should i spend it on:**\n\n* The western/southern part of norway? like, Fl\u00e5m, Bergen and Stavanger. And go to the surrounding hikes such as pulpit rock and trolltunga, and absorb the nature and cities in that region. \n\n* Or, spend 3 days in bergen, then spend the 3-4 days on the northern part such as Bod\u00f8 and the Lofoten Islands. Will it be a rushed trip?\n\n\n**Key info:**\n\n- I love to hike and would love to go to the best hiking spots in norway.\n\n- I will be traveling by trains (and planes if im going to Bod\u00f8/Lofoten)\n\n\n\nShould i leave the northern part for another trip so i can also visit other cities in that region such as Troms\u00f8.. etc? Since i will most likely come again.",

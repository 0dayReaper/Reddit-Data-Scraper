    "postText": "I (21F) travelled to Madrid to present a conference. My first three days have been largely taken up by the conference, so no time to do tourist things. The conference made me feel super lonely and out of my depths, as everyone around me already knew each other and were all very established researchers in their field (eg, top researchers at Ivy League schools). I loved attending the lectures but I felt intimidated and insecure and alone. It was a really weird experience.\n\n\nI\u2019m staying in a hostel and haven\u2019t made really many connections with people. Both my roommates don\u2019t speak English. I feel really lonely because I wish I had someone to share my experiences with. I never spend time alone with myself back home, and I was hoping on this trip I would learn to thrive in that aspect and meet new people and have adventures. I mostly just feel tired though. I also tend to be pretty afraid of men, so I\u2019m more on edge than usual being a solo female traveller. I still have 4 more days of my trip, and I don\u2019t want to continue to feel this way. Any recommendations of how to feel less lonely?",

Helps orient yourself with the city, figure out what to see over the next few days, often where to eat as well, and an almost sure fire way to meet other solo travelers - especially if you make the effort to say hi. \n\nI just finished a 1.5 month solo trip in Europe and the waking tours almost always got me a friend group to hang out with for a few days. Solo travelers are incredibly easy to spot there, often make up half the group, and are usually just as eager for travel companions as you are. Just strike up a conversation by asking where they are traveling from and make small talk from there. Chat between destinations on the waking tour, and see if they are interested in grabbing coffee/lunch/whatever afterward. And boom. Travel friends!",

How you feel when dining out, visiting a local museum or the zoo, or going to the movies alone is a pretty good indicator of how well you\u2019re going to do with solo travel.  If you can\u2019t do those things at home for just an afternoon without wishing you had a friend along, a week alone is going to be rough.  That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doomed to never enjoy a trip alone, but it does mean it\u2019s an area you should work on at home.  Travel is pretty expensive compared to outings in your hometown.  You\u2019re doing yourself a disservice if you waste your time and money trying to make your trip into a teaching experience on how to enjoy solitude when you should have started working on that at home.",

Too late to do anything about that now obviously, but if you have any interest in future solo travel I would highly recommend getting used to taking yourself out at home before you try another trip.  It\u2019s much easier to build up confidence and comfort in doing things alone one meal or one afternoon at a time in a space where you\u2019re more familiar than it is to try to do it in a foreign country where you may be experiencing culture shock and a difficult language barrier on top of loneliness.",

Depending what your spanish language abilities are, all that can add up to a very isolating experience. But, you took the initiative and did the thing, try to remind yourself of that and be proud. I agree with some other suggestions here about doing some organize tours - food tours especially are a great way to try really good restaurants with other travelers and not be lonely during meal times. I suggest Airbnb experiences or viator to start. My guess is if you try a few new things like that, you\u2019ll be glad you did, and if you try and don\u2019t like it then hey you don\u2019t have to do it again :)",

While I was in Madrid I just started dancing in a street party with a live DJ and ended up meeting a group of Spanish queer women\u2014them not speaking english and me not speaking Spanish\u2014and we had a blast, and they invited me to join them at their next stop too (but I passed because I\u2019m an American with a bedtime earlier than the 2am club openings in Europe). I\u2019ve done the same thing in lesbian bars in London, and drink only diet cokes to stay safe. \n\nCheck out a live music venue called La coquette, when I went there was a great act and you mainly just chill and listen. Wander the streets in popular neighborhoods, eat ice cream, people watch, and just soak up the atmosphere. And then when you get back home, do more stuff on your own there too!",

            "comment": "I really recommend looking long and hard at the type of hostel you are staying at. If you're not comfortable with approaching people in your dorm or the common room, a lot of hostels can still be a very lonely experience. Especially since these kinds of hostels don't necessarily attract people that are looking to make friends.\n\nWhat you want to look out for are so called social hostels, of which there are many in Spain. These hostels not only attract solo travellers and people looking to make connections, but also facilitate this through organised activities such as communal dinners, free drinks, sightseeing tours, parties/pub crawls, and a common area that is made for socialising. A good social hostel will also have a staff that puts in the effort to bring people together. When you have this low barrier to get people from the same hostel together, you'll notice making friends becomes quite easy. An example of social hostels is the Hostel One group, which has hostels in Barcelona, Madrid and Sevilla. Things to look out for: no common area is a big no no, because people that hang out here are more often looking for connections than your dormmates. Look for smaller hostels, and stay away from the big fancy looking ones. Scan the reviews and descriptions for references to organised activities, and experiences of solo travelers/people making friends. If you're using hostelworld, atmosphere is usually a big indicator as well.\n\nOther than that, look for activities that could attract other solo travelers. You'll note in general they are very open to meeting new people, even if you yourself are a bit more reserved. This could include pub crawls, walking tours, Airbnb experiences,.. Hell I'm reserved myself as well and I even met other solo travelers purely during sightseeing.\n\nHostelworld also has a chat that you can use to connect to other solo travelers traveling in the same city/same period, but in my experience it doesn't work very well.",

If you have time, maybe get to Barcelona and spend the rest of your trip there? I made friends at the hostel in BCN but people told me it wasn\u2019t as was easy to make friends in Madrid. Being afraid of men will not really benefit you, in my opinion. I solo travel a lot, and sometimes men are the ones who actually help me find directions or guide me in the right direction. In fact, I just left a metro station and a man actually walked with me into the city center and helped show me where to go. Be friendly and try not to worry. Sometimes it can be hard to relax; it definitely takes a conscious effort. I hope you\u2019re able to make the best of it and enjoy the rest of your trip!!",

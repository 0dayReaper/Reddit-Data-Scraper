    "postText": "Report people who make you feel unsafe!I've been staying at a hostel for a week.   \n\n\nLast night, there was only one guy in my dorm and me.  \n\n\nHe came in at 11. I'm in bed reading. He ignores this and starts talking to me. I'm giving him one-word answers, clearly annoyed. He misses all of my social cues.  \n\n\nHe insists I get out of bed so he can \"demonstrate\" what he learned in Tango class. Thinking this will shut him up, I get up. That was a mistake because he immediately tries to kiss me. I push him away with, \"I don't like that.\"\n\nHe answers that we should \"make this our night\" because we're alone and are two strangers \"meeting at night.\" WTFFFFF???? I say no. But this creep keeps trying to get a yes. Finally, he says, \"OK, you don't have to if you don't want to,\" and leaves.\n\nI didn't even know his name.\n\nI was shook and not sure what to do at first. Getting unwanted sexual attention is humiliating. If no one saw it, so will anyone believe your story? Are you just being overly dramatic? Is this normal behavior?  \n\n\nI literally Googled what to do. Finally, I reported it. My hostel immediately moved me to a private room. Hostels take sexual harassment seriously (as should everyone). That wasn't normal behavior.\n\nIf someone makes you feel unsafe, report it.\n\nI've been traveling (mostly alone) and living in dorms/inns/Airbnbs for 25 months. 99.99% of people aren't insistent or obtrusive like that.\n\nLet's keep each other safe by reporting the creeps.  \n\n\n\\*edit: formatting",

He would have other employers phone him when I arrived and show up knocking at my door minutes later, so there was no avoiding him. When I opened the door a crack he would jam his foot in so that I couldn't close it. He was such a creep. I left for another hostel (obviously), wrote a nasty tell-all review of my experience, and reported the experience to Airbnb through which I had booked my stay. Airbnb gave me a refund and (I think) suspended his account.\n\nActually, now that I think of it, there was another hostel employee who bothered me years ago. I was staying in a dorm room, but it was off season and I was the only one in there. Guy came calling, and I ignored him, so he crawled through the window. I was horrified. Thankfully there WERE guys staying in the male dorm next door, so I made a big racket about what a creep he was, shouted at him, slammed the door a few times. The guys all woke up (sorry guys!), and the creep slunk away. I left the next morning after a very sleepless night.\n\nGlad you're safe and that you had the wherewithal to report his behavior. You are right that the vast majority of fellow travelers are not like that. Any woman who travels on the regular has these experiences at some point though. But I remind myself there are creeps back at home too. They all need to be called out!",

Hopefully you won\u2019t see that guy again, although I would still remain cautious.\n\nI went though a similar experience in a mixed gender hostel dormitory. Except for the guy tried to follow me the next day in the city. Basically, this guy was acting weird towards me and wasn\u2019t taking any hints that I was NOT interested. The next day he asked me if we could go sight seeing together and I told him NO and made up an excuse about meeting a friend. Well he unknowingly followed me out of the hostel and approached me on the street. I was in a total panic and basically ran away, pretending to take a phone call, and hid behind a news stand. Thankfully I lost him but I was too young and timid to think about reporting him. I definitely learned a lesson to be more aware of my surroundings and to be more firm when your gut instinct is telling you something\u2019s off.",

Creating safer environments creates a better hostel culture for everyone.\n\nSome things every hostel should be doing imo:\n\n* Clear, bold, comprehensive policies that condemn sexual assault/harassment. These policies should be displayed in all common areas and included in an agreement. A culture of mutual respect should be promoted\n* Train staff to handle and recognize incidents. Provide safety pamphlets to guests and encourage bystander intervention\n* Controlled and secure access through key card systems or similar. Check guest premises for vulnerabilities\n* Anonymous reporting system\n\nMajority of hostels already do this, but there are a lot that don't. I think beds should be more secure too, but many hostels are too cheap for that.",

He tried to get in their uber as they were leaving (unwantedly and super awkward) and I had to physically restrain him to let them leave without him.  \n\nSame night, a random woman comes up to us and asks if we can pretend to know her and can she sit with us because she's alone and some guy just won't leave her alone.  Sure.  Then the second rando guy quickly appears and tries to then make friends with us.  I told him to fuck off.",

If they're the defensive type, you can even frame it like \"hey, this is a win-win \u2014 I'm helping you communicate better with women.\"\n\nIt is so very, very tiring to be on guard for behavior like this all of the time and I would love if my guy friends stepped up more rather than just being like \"damn, that's fucked up.\"",

Notice how the actual definition of the word means to cause great enthusiasm and eagerness. Are you exciting if you\u2019re being offputting and transgressing boundaries? Notice how instead of having fun passions, goals, being decent, and a plethora of other pleasantries equating to being exciting, you instead choose to distort reality into being stupid = being exciting. This is all an embarrassing reflection of your own filth. Congrats.",

I am so sorry you experienced this repulsive behavior. \n\nAn important thing to know about safety if you\u2019ve never been fortunate enough to be taught it is in these situations don\u2019t acquiesce to any creepy requests by stranger danger dude\u2019s who aren\u2019t taking your hints. If they\u2019re not it\u2019s because they\u2019re either oblivious or deliberately ignoring your non-interest, both of which are incredibly dangerous red flags. \n\nThe oblivious will take anything they can get as tacit consent to push for more and the one\u2019s who don\u2019t care may try to take what they want by force regardless of your expressed desires. Going along with  things out of politeness or because in the moment it seems like it would be easier to go along than to risk upsetting them by saying no more firmly typically puts already vulnerable people in more danger. \n\nOur internal drives to be polite or to not rock the boat shouldn\u2019t override the red flags of danger but in our modern world they frequently can and do. The book The Gift of Fear goes over this and is part of what inspired the creation of the horror movie Barbarian, I would highly recommend it to anyone but especially to women. \n\nHaving that knowledge before finding yourself in one of those situations can literally save lives. It is so incredibly valuable to know.\n\nSo glad you weren\u2019t harmed, I see you already reported it and got moved to a private room and that was exactly the right thing to do. To anyone else in a similar situation I recommend doing the same, go and make the hostel staff aware of the unwanted inappropriate contact immediately. And absolutely do not stay in the room with a guy like that. Wishing you safe and fun travels from here on out!",

He sounds worse than the usual flavor of boundary-pusher, and you did the right thing telling the front desk. I'm glad they took care of you, but I wish they'd done one step further and either kicked him out or moved him to an all-men's dorm. Hopefully he doesn't do that to anyone else, but I sure wouldn't bet on good behavior from him.\n\nOn the other hand: I feel like it is *incredibly* dangerous to rely solely on someone else getting the clue instead of clearly stating your boundaries -- \"Look, I'm trying to read. Please stop talking to me.\" He sounds like enough of a jerk he might not have listened, which is scary, but at least drawing your boundary early and cleanly doesn't paint you as an easy target.\n\nBoundary pushers know that giving hints instead of saying a clear \"No\" is a sign of someone unlikely to assert themselves, and they will take advantage of that. It's not bitchy to be direct. It is *safe* and sometimes necessary. And yeah, maybe they'll pout, but better they be butthurt than to get stuck accommodating them because they don't get the clues.",

Before that, she was being polite to a guy who - again, prior to that moment - was not being sexually inappropriate but just oblivious and wanting to interact. \n\nI\u2019ve had plenty of experiences of men being creepy and attempting to/succeeding in groping, harassing, and assaulting me in my life - but far, *far* more often than that, I have interactions with socially inept, lonely people who just want another human to look them in the eye and hear about their day. I feel the world is a slightly less dreary place when awkward people\u2019s clumsy attempts at human connection aren\u2019t always immediately rebuffed just because I\u2019m tired or I don\u2019t genuinely give a shit about their special interest/nerdy obsession or whatever. \n\nI guess she could have told him \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be impolite but I don\u2019t want to chat\u201d - but she didn\u2019t do anything wrong by not doing that. Like how much are women expected to preempt these things? (Trick Q, of course - women are, of course, always wrong whether they \u201cled him on\u201d or whether they were \u201ca bitch who just labels every slightly awkward or autistic guy as a \u2018creep\u2019, tHiS iS wHy NiCe gUyS FiNiSh lAsT\u201d). In my view, it is extremely normal and fine to start off an interaction you don\u2019t super feel like being in with subtler social cues, and then if those cues aren\u2019t picked up on, progressively escalate to more direct (or if they\u2019re not getting direct, go for even rude) ways of communicating, in proportion to the inappropriateness or unwantedness of the other person\u2019s communication. OP could tell people not to bother her when she\u2019s reading, but she did nothing wrong by not cutting this creep off at that point. It\u2019s really not a woman\u2019s responsibility to do everything she can to predict the future and preempt all unfortunate interactions with shitty men.",

    "postText": "I backpacked in Europe a few times as a young man, taking overnight trains to save on lodging, occasionally rolling out my mat on the floor of the train because there were no empty seats.  I traveled without any advance reservations for lodging, and no firm itinerary.  Upon arriving in each new city, I would stash my stuff in a locker or bag check window at the train station, and search for a pension or hostel on foot, then return later to retrieve my pack.  It was easy to meet other travelers my age and join up for a few days when we were going to the same cities.  I moved every few days, visited a lot of places, and had wonderful experiences.\n\nAs a new retiree and single, I yearned to travel abroad again but worried if I could manage it solo, feared it would be difficult to meet people, had concerns about health care abroad, and didn\u2019t think I would fit in at hostels.  This time around I wanted to stay in each place for a week or more and explore deeper, at a more relaxed pace.  I also wanted more privacy and comfort than my hostel provided 40 years ago, and expenses were less of an issue (my first trip to Europe was on a student loan; the government &amp; banks didn\u2019t  send the money directly to the college back then and I knew I would not get enough time off for a long trip once I started my career.  I had no money so I borrowed 2k and spent it all on a 5-week trip, knowing I could repay the loan once I graduated and got a job).\n\nFor my first \u201ctest trip\u201d post-retirement, I decided on a  month long visit to Argentina and Uruguay.  Before leaving the US, I booked a studio apt for a week in Buenos Aires and an inexpensive hotel for a week in Montevideo, but left myself an open itinerary for the last 2+ weeks.  I heard good things from locals about the lake region of Argentina and decided to go, booking a studio apt in Bariloche for a week.  \n\nI had a wonderful time and managed to deal with the curve balls that were thrown at me traveling alone in countries where I didn\u2019t speak the language, such as a mrsa infection in my knee that required two weeks of 2 strong antibiotics.  Treatment at an ER was prompt, professional and free!  \n\nBut didn\u2019t meet many people other than the managers of the properties where I stayed.  So when I returned to Buenos Aires for a week before my flight home, I decided to try a hostel again.  I got a single room rather than a dorm (I use a CPAP machine for sleep apnea, which can annoy others, and I need quiet to sleep well).  It was a very small and basic room but I quickly met a couple of young guys newly arrived from Germany, over a beer in the common area.  We hit it off and I felt right at home.  I concluded that both solo travel and hostels were still great at age 69.\n\nSix months later I left for a month-long, solo trip to Berlin, Krakow, and Budapest, staying at hostels and a YMCA.  I had a blast and enjoyed the hostel experience.  They were mostly much nicer than in my youth, and I always chose well-located ones with good access to public transport.  They were often in \u201chipster\u201d neighborhoods with lots of activity and youthful energy.  I was always able to get a private room at a good price.  My step tracker app reported that I walked an average of 13 miles per day, far more than was my custom at home.  Every day was a joy.    \n\nAfterward, I reflected on what enabled me to feel such joy even with the occasional panic-arousing catastrophe, such as getting pickpocketed in Berlin my 2nd day.  I noted two big differences from my life at home.  First, I did not watch TV much at all because even when I had access, I could not understand the language and I preferred to be out exploring and eating.  At home, I was use to watching TV at every meal and in the evening, but the political news often got me riled or depressed, and the commercials often seemed annoying, manipulative and dishonest.  \n\nThe most salient difference though, was the fun I had taking pictures everywhere.  This involved exploring with curiosity and focusing on things that were interesting or beautiful while framing out the boring and the ugly, then editing and sharing them with friends back home.  This has become a metaphor for my life today.  I look for the beautiful and the good, and try to avoid focusing on anything else.  It makes me feel joyful.  There are plenty of things wrong with the world, and plenty of great things too.  Whether I focus on the bad stuff or the good stuff, the world  remains the same, but I don\u2019t.  The more I practice looking for beauty and goodness, while avoiding ruminating on things that make me angry, confrontational or sad, the better I feel.  It\u2019s a bit selfish really, but I choose to act in ways that make me feel good.  When I feel joyous, I act better.  People seem to respond positively to this, and if my being kind, humble, generous, and friendly brings others some good feelings too, that\u2019s great, it\u2019s a win-win.  But mostly I do it for me. \ud83d\ude0e\n\nI am eager for covid to get under control so that I can go on my next solo trip!",

And I am from India, so another 650 EUR for flights to Reykjavik and back. Then I was on this Sarfaq Ittuk ferry that connects different towns in Greenland because there's no road connection within Greenland (either fly or sail). It was expensive but absolutely worth it. If I could go back to one place right now, it'd be Greenland hands down. \n\nWhenever you are ready, you must visit. I cannot think of anybody not loving Greenland. :)",

Make sure ratings are in the hundreds or thousands of reviews, and make sure they are like 4.5 stars and higher.\n\nThis combination will get you the cheaper rooms per night, but also the best quality. Although this might seem pretty obvious to do, the reason i did this is because you meet people who seem to be much cooler, and you don't have to put up with shitty dorms.\n\nOne thing on the older travellers too, i travelled when i was early 30's (now almost 40) and I made an effort to meet all types of people of all ages, that way when you are in a city and wanna do different things, you have contacts of all sorts with different interests.. perhaps younger people wanna party, and older people wanna do more cultural things, or vice versa.\n\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT RULE I LEARNED: if you want to meet people and feel a bit scared or socially inept, as we all do at first, then the most important thing is to break the ice as soon as possible with as many people as possible in the hostels. Try to arrive before the evening when everyone is either out or settled in. When you first arrive, book in at the front desk, put your stuff away and lock it up, get your bed in order, and then immediately go to the lobby or common areas and INTRODUCE YOURSELF and just meet people. Even if they are with a group already. Most people are soooo welcoming and they are JUST AS SCARED as you are to meet new people, well sometimes.\n\nAnyway, just put yourself out there, otherwise you feel lonely and too afraid to meet people. And also, if any opportunity presents itself to meet up or do something new, DO IT! :) &lt;3",

I will graduate in May from university and the idea of going into a corporate career where I will not be able to travel for more than once or twice is a year is heartbreaking. While the career I plan to pursue interests me greatly, nothing will every compre to my passion for travel. Delaying my career in favor of travel isn\u2019t an option, as money is unfortunately a \u201crequirement\u201d of adult life, and during quarantine the thought of living for that one trip a year has been quite depressing. Add that on to my serious relationship, which will likely lead to marriage and children in the coming years (a good thing, despite my ever-present aversion of being tied down!), and I feel consumed by the fear of never traveling again. I do love my partner very much but traveling solo is one of the best things in life that seems less possible the further life goes along.

That\u2019s so inspiring about your trips and how well they have gone.\n\nI\u2019m currently 31, but I have met some older people in my travels in hostels. When I was younger (24), I occasionally dismissed older travellers, and on reflection, that was probably be because these ones in particular complained a lot, were extremely selfish, or were trying to be \u201cthe cool older guy\u201d. \n\nBut then I met a few people that changed all of that. I met this amazing guy named Bob in Belgrade who had such great insights and stories, and gave a lot of really helpful advice about a relationship I was in (although he didn\u2019t know it). Later in Kotor, I met an older lady who sold everything, dumped her stuff at a friends house and went solo around the world. Again, absolutely inspiring. It gives such an interesting perspective.\n\nI hope that older people when travelling will have a realisation (obviously, without becoming conceited about it), that their stories and experiences can be really helpful and appreciated. I think it is an undeserving person that doesn\u2019t see the inherent benefit in befriending older travellers, because they miss out on an opportunity to step outside of their usual circle perhaps, get a new view on life, and even sometimes, learn a great deal.\n\nKudos!",

            "comment": "First, for older (or not) solo traveling ladies: [https://solotravelerworld.com/](https://solotravelerworld.com/) . I don't follow that blog religiously but I think the woman who runs it is pretty big on hostels - it may help some readers here.\n\nAs to myself: 57 guy, solo traveling for 4 years. I can unequivocally say that it changed my life. And I can't wait to get out there again. I've always been a bit of a loner - socially distancing way before covid. Not that I don't have friends and acquaintances, I have tons. But I don't do well when I can't control the amount of time I'm around other people (hence no partner) :) You would think then that solo travel was invented for me but for some reason I always believed that you need company for that. So I barely traveled at all even though I had this deep seated belief that travel is \"good for me\" - kind of like flossing. Well, one day I called a travel agent and asked him to send me to South America for a month - I figured that since I have no experience traveling I might as well outsource the organization to someone else. At that time I wasn't really counting every dollar either so I ended up doing quite an upscale tour with guides picking me up from the airports and driving me to local attractions. That part was unbearable, upscale hotels were mostly a boring miss with one major hit (Belmond at Iguasu waterfalls) and agent's recommendations were sometimes brilliant (a sculpture park in Inhotim, Brazil) and sometimes corny af (something called Argentinian Experience in Buenos Aires, a cooking class or what not). \n\nI learned a lot on that trip and next year I bought a plane ticket to SE Asia with roughly sketched out 2 months itinerary (HKG, Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, SG). I did a lot reading but did not pre-book anything. It almost worked out as planned. I had to skip Laos because all flights from Chiang Mai to Laos were sold out for the dates I wanted. That was fine, I went to Phuket instead. I loved the freedom and unexpected challenges and figured out what kind of a traveler I am ( into arts, architecture and big cities, hate shopping and need nature occasionally but hardly a hiker - definitely spontaneous). On that trip I made a few random friends that still stay in touch. I also learned what Grindr is for, lol.\n\nAfter that I decided that if I'm going to keep traveling (and keep on using Grindr), I needed to get in shape so I signed up for gym and even got a trainer. It took a while to get a hang of it but I actually really got into lifting and eating well. I'm still at it.\n\nIn the meantime I discovered travel credit cards, points and miles. So last year I booked a one way ticket to Japan with American Airlines miles. First class in JAL cost me 72k AA miles (a bit more than a bonus for opening a card) and $5.60. It was a completely unorganized, busy 3 months long trip that took me all the way from Sapporo to Hateruma with tons of stops in between, 3 day bike ride, an art festival around Seto Inland Sea, hostels, capsules hotels, onsens, planes, tranes, ferries, buses... more new friends.. eh, long story. I left Japan for Taiwan which might be my favorite place I've ever visited and then used more points and miles to go Europe for a month and finally go back to NY (where I live). On that trip I started using Instagram to document my travels:  It turned into a diary with more snarky comments than I care to admit but it documents how I felt about places then and there - not always happy when it's raining for 3 days and you have to throw out your only pair of sneakers :)  Time makes every experience amazing so I don't mind looking back and chuckle at some of that bitching.\n\nI looked at my finances and realized that I don't need to work anymore (I'm very lucky but I also always lived below my means - way before FIRE movement was a thing) and I don't want to sell the most valuable thing I own - my time - so I stopped working. It was supposed to be full time travel from then on but covid happened... sigh. Then I was going to use free time to learn Spanish and riding a motorcycle but it turns out I'm not as motivated as I thought. And I hate gears so maybe I'll stick to scooters... lol\n\nSo what's next? I think I want to slow down and mix propel travel with living mini-lives at places I like. Running around Asia for 3 months, followed by 3 months in Bali or Taipei, where I would find a gym, my favorite coffee place and lunch spot, make new friends and feel at home at the end. I have a dual US/Polish citizenship so I can live anywhere in EU for as long as I want and may end up moving to Lisbon for a while. Plus I'm working on getting a residency in Panama. Because why not?\n\nAll that happened because one day I decided to solo travel...",

                    "comment": "It\u2019s been my experience that virtually everywhere I traveled was fascinating and wonderful, perhaps because it was new to me and I embraced whatever I encountered.  Often the best adventures came from following the suggestions of people I met traveling.  One time in Greece circa 1980 or 1885, I wandered into a shop that sold photographs that looked intriguing.  All the men in the photos had full beards like me but longer.  \n\nIn that era, beards were considered radical in corporate America, and could prevent you from getting hired.  I recall going on an interview at JC Penny\u2019s headquarters in NYC.  I was told when I arrived on a top floor that news of my arrival sporting a beard had reached HR before I got to my floor and emerged from the elevator for the interview (I didn\u2019t get the job).  Anyway, the photographer told me the photos were of monks living in the Mt Athos penninsula, a holy place in the Orthodox Church where medieval monasteries were still occupied.  He told me that Constatine IX in the 12th Century had forbidden this place to all \u201cfemales, eunichs, and clean shaven men.\u201d  I\u2019m not sure about the historical accuracy of my recollection, but that was all I needed to hear to want to visit.  It required getting a letter from the US consonsolate and approval by the Greek authorities, which allowed visits only for religious pilgrims and for study.  My status as a grad student got me in.  \n\nI had to travel by train to Thessaloniki, then a bus over the mountains to a tiny village (no banks or place to change money), where I stayed overnight in a room rented out by a family.  They were so proud of their first refrigerator and offered to let me put any food I was carrying in it.  I watched the family through my open air window (no glass or screen) as they sat outside cleaning their fresh catch of sea urchins.  \n\nThe next morning I took the small daily ferry to the entry port of the only town on Mt Athos.  An old schoolbus took arriving passengers into town where we had to show our visitor permits.  The only way to get around after that was hiking through massive old abandoned olive groves and mountain paths leading to the various monasteries:  Greek Orthodox, Russian Orhodox, Serbian Orthodox, et al.  At each one, a monk greeted me and offered free accommodations and food.  I recall the first one served me Turkish coffee and delicious rose hip candies that resembled firm cubes of rose flavored jello dipped in powdered sugar.  \n\nI hiked onward to the next monestery where I stayed the night in a small dorm for guests.  Because I am not Orthodox, I could not eat with the monks, but was served dinner afterward with a couple other travelers.  There were stainless steel bowls on the table filled with tomatoes, peppers, olives, feta cheese and cucumbers.  You cut them up to make your own salad, and a monk served lentil soup and bread.  The monks grew all their own food in amazingly lush gardens irrigated by ancient stone-lined ditches.  Even the animals were only males, so now cows or dairy.  (I swear I saw a calico cat though, which I think are only female) Loud talking, laughing and taking photos of the monks were not permitted.  The monastery gate was locked each night at 8:00 and you had to be inside by then or you were locked out.  Mt Athos had 40,000 monks and hermits living there in its heyday in the 15th Century, but only 1500 were living there the year I visited, and some monasteries were no longer inhabited.  I only got to see 2 because they were far apart.  The biting horseflies on the trails were the only downside; it felt like I was living with n another era.  I accompanied the monks to a vesper service held in a grotto with a circular stone bench.  On the way they stopped beside a beautiful peach tree and picked a peach for each of us.  It was the most delicious peach I\u2019ve ever eaten.  The vesper service was in Greek but a fellow traveler whispered the translation in my ear, occasionally  gettin g admonished by a monk for speaking too loud. \nIt was a long trek but fascinating and a fond memory.",

Sometimes they are attached to bars, like the one in Vancouver on the main street. That way you can have your security and comfort, and still meet people.

I've traveled as a couple before and that's hard. I definitely met less people because we weren't as approachable and i had very little time on my own. It's much easier to meet new people in hostels.

In that moment my cash was artfully taken from my wallet while my cards and wallet were left in my hip picket.  I intuitively checked to feel my wallet still there, and didn\u2019t discover the theft until I returned to my hostel.  Amazing really.\nI felt naively safe in Berlin and let my guard down, braking a few of my own rules:  failing to keep my wallet better protected in a front pocket, keeping more cash on me than I expected to spend that day, being flattered and hoping that the encounter was authentic even though my gut told me something was not right.  It wasn\u2019t a catastrophe but it shook me for a bit and I was more vigilant after that.\nPickpockets and scammers were abundant in Berlin, but usually they were young women or girls and boys asking if I spoke English and approaching with a document in their hand that looked like they might be gathering signatures.  The guard at the US embassy by the Brandenburg Gate told me there were many similar incidents in that square every day.  A stern reproach quickly chased them away.",

I\u2019m glad you feel ready to experience the joys and adventures of solo travel as a newly single adult ready for the next chapter in your life.\n\nCovid prevented me from traveling abroad for two years but I am eagerly awaiting my next solo trip.  I leave in a week for a month-long visit to Mexico City; Medellin, Colombia; and Santiago, Chile.  Isolation due to Covid set me back some physically and emotionally, as I imagine it did for many people.  \n\nTravel is my antidote.  To prepare, I have been walking regularly again, increasing the distance each day.  Returning to the gym after being vaccinated has helped a lot, both mentally and physically.   I got a trainer because I felt I had lost ground, and my hips and knees hurt, limiting my activities.  \n\nMy trainer was excellent; he changed my life.  He identified my Achilles heel (weak glutes and underused hips) and helped me remedy both.  Basically,  I added body weight squats along with weight bearing leg exercises at the gym, and some yoga stretches that focus on hip mobility and back flexibility.  Progress was slow but steady and I went from barely being able to climb steps at all due to pain and stiffness, to being able to trot up a few flights of stairs with ease.  I can\u2019t quite believe it, but it impressed upon me how tenuous my health can be, how crucial it is for me to work at maintaining functional fitness, and how great it feels to have all my body parts moving easily again.  \n\nI also wanted very much to lose my \u201cCovid belly\u201d and return to having a flat stomach.  I succeeded by intermittent fasting 16/8 for 4 months, dropping 15 pounds and 4 inches in my waist.  I continue on that regimen but not as strictly, and so far I have maintained my new weight.  Eating more veggies (3 servings at dinner and 1 or 2 at breakfast/lunch), and much less sugar, white flour, and other highly processed foods has been a great boost for my mood and energy level.  I enjoy cooking, and have been pleasantly surprised at how delicious healthier food can be, and how junk food has become less appealing.  \n\nEating healthier while traveling and relying mostly on restaurants will be challenging but I look forward to it.  It\u2019s startling to me to be 71 and still having fun, while feeling happier and healthier than at any time in my life (despite multiple chronic diseases including hiv, COPD, kidney disease, moderate/severe scoliosis, and a history of all 3 kinds of skin cancer).  Recently, I recovered from Covid too, just in time for my trip.  I\u2019m so happy to be living the dream.  You will too!",

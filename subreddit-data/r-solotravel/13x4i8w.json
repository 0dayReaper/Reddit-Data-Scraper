    "postText": "Hi everyone! Just looking for some feedback on a trip to Italy. I've been to the Italy before, as I spent 5 days in the Dolomites skiing, and I think it was the most beautiful place on earth. I am looking to go sometime in the September to November range, likely late October going into November. \n\nI'm trying to strike a balance between big city stuff (museums, ruins, churches etc) and nature (hiking, beaches, wineries etc).\n\nDay:\n0. Overnight flight from US\n1. Arrive in morning, travel to first destination\n2. Cinque Terre or Lake Como\n3. Cinque Terre or Lake Como\n4. Travel Day (see Pisa on the way)\n5. Florence \n6. Florence\n7. Florence\n8. Travel Day\n9. Amalfie Coast/Naples\n10. Amalfie Coast/Naples\n11. Amalfie Coast/Naples\n12. Travel Day\n13. Rome\n14. Rome\n15. Rome\n16. Fly home\n\nI'm not exactly sure on flights yet, but it would likely be some combination of Milan and/or Rome, and I'd adjust the order as needed.\n\nAny suggestions for specific areas to stay in each city would be appreciated.",

            "comment": "This will be amazing! Some tips for Amalfi: \n\nStay in Atrani. Its a bordering village to Amalfi town and is mostely locals. You get to blend in a little and avoid tourists for the most part, and Amalfi/Positano is just a walk away. They have a beautiful piazza feet from the beach.\n\nTheres a hike from here up to Ravello that is my favorite travel memory ever. Its paved with lots of stairs through lemon farms. And Ravello is a MUST see. You can walk around Ravello and see everything in 4-5 hours, then hike back down.",

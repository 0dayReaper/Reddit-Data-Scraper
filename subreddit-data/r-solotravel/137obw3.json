    "postText": "Hello, beautiful people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStarting june I have between 6 or 8 months of remote work that I plan expending abroad. I will be mostly in Asia, and right now I'm researching about travel in Pakistan (in october). There seems to be a lack of recent information about independent travel there, so I wonder if any of you have experience you can share with me.  \n\n\nSome personal info: I'm a 33 Brazilian male. I have solo traveled in Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Paraguay, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Australia. In this next trip, before arriving in Pakistan I will have visited Germany, Mongolia, South Korea and India, around a month each. I enjoy traveling independently and figuring how to work stuff out. Usually, I only join tours when there is no other option, and even then I prefer to arrive in a place by myself and look into tours later.\n\nI'm aware of the hassles and travel advisories regarding the country, but considering the places I've been and where I live, I believe I'm prepared to deal with scams and safety issues. Spending a month in India will probably help with the cultural shock, too. Also,  one of the main reasons I want to travel Pakistan is because it seems to be a little challenging.\n\nI'm looking into regions that are regarded as safer in Pakistan, mainly Hunza Valley and Skardu in Gilgit-Baltistan. I've seen a lot of vlogs about tours departing from major cities, but I would rather get to Gilgit-Baltistan on my own using public transport (I can't drive), stopping in a few places along the way (Naran picked my interest). Since I have time to spend, I don't mind taking long or having a few buses cancelled due to weather, blocks or other circumstances. Also, in this region I plan to take some proper vacation time, so I don't need to stay connected.\n\nNATCO seems to be the main company that operates buses around those areas. Their website shows routes departing from Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi, but I couldn't find information about local transport. I can see on their map that they painted routes between towns, but their booking page is not working for me.\n\nSo, my main concerns are:\n\nHow is the public transport situation between cities in north Pakistan. For example, are there coaches and vans running between Gilgit, Karimabad and Skardu, or would I need to hire a private driver? If so, how easy it is to find people to share?\n\nIf moving around towns and a few popular spots (like Fairy Meadows) turns out to be a hassle using public transport, is it easy to join a tour group once I'm already in Gilgit, Karimabad and Skardu?\n\nAlso, most travel advisories say that Peshawar is among the most dangerous places, but most bloggers that actually went there say it's fine. What do you think?\n\nFinally, any other tip or recommendation about other destinations in Pakistan is welcome and will help a lot. Depending on how much time I get after north Pakistan, I'll probably try visiting Sindh, but I haven't searched that yet\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "My information is a bit dated &amp; I have only gone from North to South but.\n\nI went from Gilgit-ISB in a shared car. And from Sost to Gilgit in a Hiace bus and neither were a problem. I would be surprised if you cant find vans running between the other towns and cities.\n\nFor fairy meadows and other touristy spots you will probably be better with a hired car but I think these are affordable or you can find people to share with.\n\nI wouldn't say Peshawar is particularly dangerous, I visited there last year and it seemed like anywhere else in Pakistan. They did have some recent trouble however.\n\nI dont know your trip order, but I would highly recommend going Korea - Cross over to china and make your way west to Urumqi by high speed rail - Kashgar- Tashkurgan- Then down to Pakistan- Sosft-Gilgit-Islamabad-Lahore-India.\n\nI can recommend the China pakistan bus, I had such a great experience on it and from what I can see the buses are running again.",

It was peaceful at the time, but there were soldiers and police everywhere. While things have kind of blown up recently, at the time it was totally peaceful and fine, one of my trip highlights for sure. People were (mostly) lovely, landscapes were amazing, food was delicious. Plenty of transportation between cities, mostly in the form of shared SUVs because of the terrain. I never had trouble finding a seat in a shared SUV. I was able to book those from any of the number of travel agencies around town. \n\nThat said, Kashmir was also one of the only place I got scammed and felt unsafe. When i confronted the scammers i was in a remote aread outside of town. They threatened to find me later (dude pulled out a knife) and things got pretty heated for a minute. I was able to get away but it definitely shook me up.",

I didn\u2019t get off anywhere in between though. \n\nThere\u2019s some minibuses that go to Karimabad, Skardu, and other places, it seems like you just go to the bus station and they leave when full. You usually have to take a taxi to get to some of the hiking drop of points though. Also hitchhiking is a perfectly good option as well! For meet ups check out the backpacking Pakistan FB group, you might get some hits there. I met someone to share taxis with, but there\u2019s not a ton of foreigners there so it\u2019s not exactly easy! \n\nPeshawar is completely safe for walking around, everyone is super friendly. I think the main concern is just because there seems to be a mosque bombing every few years. \n\nIt\u2019s really not that difficult to get around, people speak decent English and are will always willing to help tourists!",

What do you think?\r  \n\r\n\nAround 10-12 years ago, the Pakistani military started to really crack down on the Taliban insurgency in the region, but before that the northern part of Pakistan where Peshawar is saw some some pretty bad violence. That's part of where these warnings and this reputation are coming from. This is an ongoing conflict, so you can follow the news and read what other people say to help you make the best decision.",

            "comment": "Was all over Pakistan last August.\n\nIs Peshawar safe? Most of the time. They do have huge terrorist attacks from time to time. I would avoid religious sites and areas as those seem to be the places targeted. My time in Peshawar was spent almost entirely in a hotel room feeling like I was on the brink of death from sickness that I thought was covid but tested negative for. The little time I did spend walking around I felt a bit sketchier than other parts of Pakistan.\n\nThe only danger in Gilgit-Baltistan is of the natural disaster type (see floods last August for example, and if riding a motorcycle on the Karakoram Highway you will see aftermath of rockfall). They have buses and minibuses between Skardu/Gilgit/Hunza from what I remember but you should 100% learn how to ride a motorcycle and do it like that. It is near the top of my list of places to return to.\n\nLahore is also a gem and worth at least a few days.\n\nKarachi is a trip... I can't say I loved it but am happy I visited it and enjoyed my time there.\n\nThere is no reason to join a tour, everything can be done independently. It's an incredible country with some of the most stunning sights, nearly empty of foreign tourism and with really nice people. Enjoy.\n\nOh, and Islamabad is hilarious. Feels more like the US than anything.",

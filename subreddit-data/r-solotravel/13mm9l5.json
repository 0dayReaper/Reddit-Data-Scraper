    "postText": "I\u2019m in south east Asia for the next 22 days till I fly back to Europe from the Philippines. Was traveling with a friend who after a rough experience in a Cambodian hostel ( no power, no water, hot sun) decided to head back home.\n\nMy itinerary still has some non refundable flights and bookings to Laos (Luang Prabang), Thailand (Bangkok and ko Samet), and Vietnam ( Ho Chi Minh). I also have another 4 days in Cambodia with no real plan. \n\nRoughly speaking the price to fly home is the same as what I\u2019d pay in food and accom to keep going. I\u2019ve solo traveled last summer in Senegal (tough but enjoyable) for 1.5 months. Am stuck between a rock and a hard place as I\u2019d enjoy being home with friends, but also would feel guilty about wasting this trip as one doesn\u2019t always get the chance to do this! I\u2019ve made a couple friends on the road already too. \n\nAny tips, advice, or similar stories?\n\nUpdate 1: overwhelmed with the responses to this post! Decided to pull myself together a bit and shake it off; heading to Kampot now with some new friends and just gonna see where the next two weeks take me. Thank you for all the advice and tips, has helped so so much",

Said he was jumped and lost his passport and credit card. Everyone at the hostel gathered around him and tried to befriend him plus buy him drinks and a little food until he got his new credit card\n\nOf course this guy ended up being an absolute psychopath and it became increasingly clear after only the first time we invited him out. It turned out that he was kicked out of 5 hostels around the city before for being belligerently drunk and inappropriately touching girls. \n\nThe moral of the story though is that if you make it known that something bad has happened on your trip, people in the hostel will normally try to help you. Just don't be a psychopath hahahaha",

You don't need to hop around countries as that can be stressful. So if you are concerned about doing they alone then perhaps just pick one and hangout and soak it up stress free. Philippines meets that criteria. In Bangkok yiu can probably get away with English. Vietnam is gonna be more stressful especially if you move around outside the big city. That's why I was suggesting just go soak up the Philippines.",

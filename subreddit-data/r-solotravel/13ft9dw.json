    "postText": "23M here solo traveling to Colombia for 3 weeks in July. I chose Colombia as I am nearly fluent in Spanish and because of the vast array of things to do/see. \r  \n\r  \nWeek 1: Fly into Cartagena. It seems Gestemani is the area to stay in. Definitely want to do a day trip to Isla de Rosario (or stay a night there if not too pricey) Any snorkel trip suggestions? \r  \n\r  \nWeek 2: Take a bus to Medellin. Looking for restaurant suggestions, interesting tours, parks and historical places to visit. Los Patios Hostel seems to be a good spot. Any other hostel recs in Medellin?\r  \n\r  \nWeek 3: Fly to Leticia and stay at Yoi Ecolodge and go on jungle hikes. Any other suggestions or hikes to do in the rainforest here?\r  \n\r  \nSpecifically, I am looking for interesting food/hostel/tour recs in Cartagena and Medellin. I am not looking to much partying as I will be solo, unless I meet a good group. Also, how is the bus trip from Cartagena to Medellin? I may fly if it is easier",

The bus is super long, and will definitely take longer than what's stated online, plus Colombian buses aren't that comfy compared to other countries in South America. I highly recommend the black sheep hostel in Medellin too. Sure its not as fancy as Los Patios, but it's super social, and was one of my favourites in South America. People I met who stayed at both said Los Patios is a bit soulless.",

Busses take waaaay longer than advertised in Colombia. \n\nNot sure if you\u2019re looking for suggestions your itinerary but I\u2019d highly recommend Salento! Hiking through the Cocora Valley is a travel highlight for me. Super unique landscape! I personally didn\u2019t love Cartegena so a week is too long there anyway IMO",

            "comment": "Spent a month traveling Colombia in March. Here are some quick suggestions:\n\n-You don\u2019t need a whole week in Cartagena, there\u2019s not too much to see\n-Spend a night or two on Rosario Island, you can snorkel there. Stay in Secreto hostel, walk the island, check out the little town, BRING TONS OF CASH, no cards on the island except in the expensive hotels\n-take a 4 hour bus ride to Santa Marta for a few days and visit Tayrona national park. You can sleep in a hammock right on the beach! \n-Someone else said Salento and I second it if you can make it work. Cocora Valley is absolutely stunning\n\nIn Medellin:\nReal City Tours are your go to for walking tours. There\u2019s one in the main part of the city and a walking tour in Communa 13 (that might have been a different company but It was one of the first ones I saw on Google). The tours are incredible. Bring lots of cash to Communa 13, enjoy the street food, wander, enjoy the bars. It\u2019s a very cool area and very safe!\n\nAlso, the day tour to Guatap\u00e9 is great! Whatever hostel you stay at probably has a tour you can hop on",

            "comment": "Yoi ecolodge looks nice. I regret not doing a 4 night jungle trek. Everything we did in the Amazon required a boat to go places, but the guides never went deep into the Amazon. We always stayed by the river. They would stop at villages where the locals would do a dance then ask for tips.\n\n I was disappointed to not be able to take any guided hikes through thick jungle. I guess there aren\u2019t many trails and the jungle is hard to get a trek through unless it\u2019s one of those overnight treks. the Amazon is so hot during the day and the animals can hear you from far away they hide so I didn\u2019t see much during the day. \n\nMake sure to do a night hike and bring a good headlamp. There\u2019s more to see at night. We saw an ocelot and tons of other animals. It is worth doing a day trip on a boat to see the pink river dolphins and see the monkey island.\n\nIf you have any extra time in Leticia go to Restaurante Cevicheria Nativo for the best Peruvian ceviche!\n\nWe stayed at secreto hostel in isla Grande. It\u2019s a must do. We did 4 nights. The scuba diving was great there. The water temp was 87F at 45 feet down and it was only 10 minutes by boat. The scuba tour we did was very professional and the only tour actually not only on time but early the entire trip.  The hostel blasted music during the day but I didn\u2019t mind as I could nap at the private beach they have. It rained almost every night which cooled the rooms off. \n\nThe bioluminescent bay is one of the brightest in the world, it\u2019s definitely worth it, but not good for the bioluminescent plankton to swim in. Much better than in Puerto Rico. I ate from unmarked shacks and I never got sick. The food was great. Bring your own mask and snorkel if you can. \n\nPermethrin is highly recommended everywhere for clothes, yet it is a poison, even the label says do not put it onto base layers or put on clothing that you will sweat in as the poison will absorb into your skin in high amounts. I would go with picaridin instead and only use permethrin with mosquito nets, tarps, and canopies. \n\nPatagonia capilene sun hoodies are very comfortable, dry fast, and have some anti odor treatment. Patagonia terrebonne joggers were great in the Amazon for mosquito protection, are thin, stretchy, and not too hot. \n\nBring a headlamp with a red light to save your night time vision and batteries. I use sea to summit ultra-sil dry sacks and have never had a leak, I use the dry silicon gel packs inside to prevent condensation. \n\nMy mesh trail runners and micro crew socks worked well when I was there for day trips, but used rain boots for the mud during the night hike. Most of the time I used teva sandals. \n\nThe katadyn be free water filter is better than the sawyer, and is shake to clean. I filtered from the tap saving me from having to buy water bottle and creating plastic waste in the Amazon. \n\nI rinsed my clothes every day due to the sweat and used the sea to summit clothes line.\n\nI would bring a wide brim synthetic mesh hat.",

You can take a 4/5 hour bus to Santa Marta and from there take a short bus to Minca, Tayrona, Coste\u00f1o beach, which are some of my favourite places I\u2019ve been to in South America. \n\nI don\u2019t think there is a direct flight from SM to Leticia but flights are super cheap to Medellin / Bogota.",

Agree that 4-5 nights is probably enough in Cartagena.",

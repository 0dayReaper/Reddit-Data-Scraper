    "postText": "(Trying for second time with more detail)\n\nHi!\n\nI\u2019m planning my first ever solo trip to Sri Lanka for start of June . I\u2019ve backpacked previously around Asia/ South America but this is first time solo.\n\nI\u2019m interested in surfing/ beaches , culture and hiking and hopefully some leopards too.\n\nMy rough plan so far is \n\nDay 1 - stay in negombo one night \nDay 2 -4Anuradhapura  \nDay 5 - Sighirya \nDay 6-  travel to Kandy \nDay 7- train to Ella\nDay 8 - Ella\nDay 9- travel to weligama \nDay 10-14 weligama \nDay 15-16 travel back to Colombo / fly home \nPlanning on doing a camp in weligama (or elsewhere dependent on advice/ weather)\nOther than the train to Ella planning on using taxis - is this worth it or are the trains also generally reliable/ ok for solo females?\n\nBudget wise I\u2019m looking at spending \u00a36-700 not including surf camp (while staying in dorm rooms / would like most budget to go on excursions etc)",

While taxi can be nice, my worst travel experiences in Sri Lanka was with taxi drivers. It felt like a miracle every time I stepped out of the car alive. The traffic there really is among the worst in the world.",

I went in February and the entire time it was perfect. \n\nIf you want a good tip tho, skip Sigiriya rock and do Pidurangala instead at sunset looking at Sigiriya for the better view. It\u2019s to this day the most beautiful sight I\u2019ve ever seen in 34 countries.",

Enjoy your trip but please be on your guard, don\u2019t go anywhere dark or isolated on your own.",

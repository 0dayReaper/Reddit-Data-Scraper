    "postText": "There are obviously a ton of posts on here about backpacking, staying in dorms/hostels, budget travel, etc., but where are all of the solo travelers who enjoy a more luxurious trip (along the lines of 4 and 5 star hotels) ? Are you out there? Even in my early 20s (I\u2019m female fwiw) I hated hostels and tried to avoid them unless it was a private room. 10 years later and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m Jeff Bezos (I take public transport while traveling, eat at high and low end places, have a general travel budget) but I will do all I can (points, discount codes, sales) to make sure I\u2019m staying in a nice hotel, it\u2019s one of my favorite parts of the trip!\n\nSo, for fellow solo travelers like me, what have been some of your favorite solo hotel experiences? Any upcoming trips you\u2019re looking forward to?\n\n\nEDIT - wow this post really took off!!! After many many  DMs and a few comments on this post, I went ahead and made a sub for us! r/luxsolotravel",

I've never understood why I can't both like to walk and also have a comfy bed, fab shower and nice meal.  I do mix it up a bit with both low and high end to hit an average nightly budget though.  Stayed in a quite questionable \"hotel\" once for $50/night so I could splurge on staying in a castle.  10/10 would do again!\n\nI do travel off season (super hot/super cold not great for walking IMHO) which helps raise the standard.\n\nInterestingly, in over a decade of long-distance walking trips staying at 1\\* to 5\\* properties I've never once had an attitude from a hotel employee about my backpack or hiking outfit/level of dishevelment from walking 15+ miles.  That was my worry early on but it proved to be not an issue at all.  Neither have I ever had a restaurant, cheap or michelin starred, blink at me being a solo diner.  I do tend to offer to sit at the bar, especially if it's busy though.",

From what i've read, hiking in the Swiss Alps is nice, where you can stay in a nice inn every night.\n\nWhat long walks have you done? How do you find the lodging? Do you need reservation or is it easy to find a decent place by just showing up?",

I've only ever planned and booked my own holiday and carried my backpack but I'd probably give Macs Adventures a try if I wanted to have my luggage transfered and someone else plan everything.    \n\nOne of my first trips was - [https://www.macsadventure.com/us/tour-1445/the-king-ludwig-way/](https://www.macsadventure.com/us/tour-1445/the-king-ludwig-way/) .  I think it's a great 'starter' trip with mostly easy but stunning walking.  It's super easy to get to on the S-Bahn from Munich.   It's a lovely mix of forests, fields, gorges, monastarites, castles, lakes, villages and farms all while walking towards the stunning backdrop of the alps.\n\nI'd add a day on either end if you have the time.  One to walk from Starnberg to Tutzing along the lake path, stopping about half way to take the lovely little ferry out to Roseninsel ( [https://www.roseninsel.bayern/](https://www.roseninsel.bayern/) ) which was a favorite of King Ludwig and his cousin Sissy (Empress of Austria).  Tutzing has a couple of lovely outdoor places on the lake for lunch.  I adore - [https://midgardhaus.de/tutzinger-biergarten/](https://midgardhaus.de/tutzinger-biergarten/) \\- can't miss it as you walk right past it.  I'd imagine their restaurant is excellent, but I haven't tried it. \n\nYou can then catch the main ferry ( [https://www.seenschifffahrt.de/en/lake-starnberg/](https://www.seenschifffahrt.de/en/lake-starnberg/) ) from Tutzing back to Starnberg, passing the Votive Chapel where Ludwig died.  You could also get off earlier at Leoni and walk back visiting the chapel, or get off at Berg after seeing the chapel from the water and walk the little bit back to Starnberg which is quite lovely.   \n\nAt the end you'll want a whole day to visit the castles in Fussen (Neushwantstein and Hohenschwangau).  Make sure to pre-book tickets at [https://www.hohenschwangau.de/](https://www.hohenschwangau.de/) !  \n\nI've done walks in England, Scotland, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic and the US.

There were a bunch of us and we knew each other.  \n\nI\u2019m not necessarily a luxury traveler but I like nice hotels. \n\nAnd planes or trains, if an upgrade to business or first class is less than $100-200 depending on the distance, I will spend it to ease my claustrophobia and be more comfortable\n\nI\u2019m a hobby level photographer.  I will spend $100 or more on photography tours.   I learn new skills and I get some great photos as souvenirs.  West coast of Ireland and Iceland are on my list.\n\nI\u2019m in my 50s.  Back in my 20s and 30s I packed mostly shoes.  Now I only pack my hardcore walking sneakers, dressy sneakers and a pair of comfy dress shoes (all black) I can wear to a nice dinner.  As well as some slides which double as slippers and flip flops.  That\u2019s it. Unless I need snow boots or something.  \n\nI\u2019ve taken to packing a travel clothesline I can use in the hotel shower to have more room in my luggage for camera stuff.\n\nBut I will spend for hotel prices for laundry if it\u2019s an area I may not get to visit again vs going to a laundromat.   I do some hand washables in the sink. Shampoo can be used as detergent.   Underwear, I\u2019ll wash and hang up on the clothesline.  Things which take more time or space to dry will go to hotel laundry if the trip is longer than a week.  \n\nI will have at least one really nice dinner at a nice restaurant with appetizers to desserts, cocktails and wine.  The rest of the trip I\u2019ll try a variety of places.  A few nights during a 10 day trip to the uk, I picked up sandwiches and beer at Tescos because I was too tired to go out for dinner.   \n\nI spend evenings during travel downloading my photos from the day in case my camera is lost or stolen.  It would be expensive to replace my camera, but I\u2019d be more upset at losing the photos.",

LOL!\n\nI would say a word for doing laundry in Europe though.  I've found in recent years they're clean, safe and easy to use with apps to pay and detergent included.  I've found some really interesting places I wouldn't have gone to otherwise - like in Aracena Spain where the laundromat was co-located with an amazing little gourmet Jamon shop and sweet tapas bar!  I also find that's a good time to regather myself, shoot off some texts, organize photos etc. Oddly it's probably the most common place I interact with simply locals - not servic staff.  Plus I really like properly cleaned clothes!  (it might make a difference that I've probably worn everything in my pack at least two to three times before doing laundry LOL!).\n\nI'm thinking off to Portugal and Spain in fall to walk some of the Portuguese Camino.  You?",

But you then return to the laundromat, only to start using your newly secure coinage, and only vending machine is out of all the normal washing powders, so instead you get to try a product for wool garments and hope it works OK on your cotton+linen stuff  \n\nSo yeah, that left a mark.",

                            "comment": "I stayed at the Westin Dragonara when I was in Malta in October. It's a bit outside the main area of Valetta, but with Uber and the Maltese alternative called Bolt it was easy to call for a ride as I left the room and the car would arrive in the time it took me to walk outside. Dragonara Hotel has nice pools and a private beach which was a plus. \n\nProtip: There is a casino at the Dragonara resort. I'm not a gambler, but if you go in as a 1st time visitor, they have a promotion where they give you a \u20ac20 voucher card. I was able to play for an hour on the slots with the card, and walked out with \u20ac50 cash.\n\nDragonara also has their own excursions which you can book with the concierge. I arranged a Blue Lagoon tour in Gozo that way. \n\nFinal Protip: The best and most underrated thing to see in Malta is The Hypogeum, a man-made underground temple and tunnel network carved into the bedrock and it's 5000+ years old. It's notoriously hard to get tickets for, because they only allow 10 people per hour to enter on their guided tours. It's one of the only UNESCO sites on Malta, and I highly recommend a visit, but you *must* book online weeks in advance.",

(To each their own, just not my thing) \n\nI think you probably see a lot more posts about them, because they cater to travelers who have less experience traveling, so there are more questions.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say I need a luxury hotel so much as a nice, well located place. I tend towards more local, non chain, well located accommodations. \n\nFor me, some of my favorite places I\u2019ve stayed are: \n1. A hotel in Kanazawa, Japan where I rode out my first Typhoon in 2018, that had a Sento. (Japanese communal bath house) The Sento was a fun cultural experience that I took advantage of, when I was stuck inside the day of the Typhoon.\n\n2. A small boutique hotel in Amsterdam. Some of the friendliest staff around. When my flight got cancelled and rebooked for the following day, even though they were fully booked, they called their sister property to find me a room. It didn\u2019t work out, (sister property wanted $600 a night.) but they tried!\n\n3. Business hotel in Hakodate, Japan. One of the best hotel breakfasts I think I have ever had. Think bento \ud83c\udf71 box style.\n\n4. A small, family owned hotel in Honfleur, France. 18th Century half timbered Mansion that was converted into hotel rooms. Besides the charm of the place itself, the owners were very friendly, and the breakfast they served was amazing.\n\n\nUpcoming trip that I am really looking forward to? Solo road trip around Sicily about a month from now.",

Stayed at **Marina Bay Sands**' corner Suite for 3 nights in Singapore (kinda an accidental booking d/t discount that still cost about $2.5K USD, but worth it as its a birthday trip).  The hotel actually gave me a birthday cake without me telling them for free (they do have my passport info so they can tell that its my birthday).\n2. got into **Sheraton Waikiki** for 4 nights for $1K, with view looking over diamond head and the beach for cheap (this is during COVID).\n\nAnd the best way to achieve these \"luxury\" trips is by using credit card/airline/hotel points, and always go for hotels with deep discounts, even if it means you have to lock in the rate early and pay ahead.  And also, pay way ahead does help with your later budget, since you can sort out of the payments early and start paying off the bills early too.\n\nTo prove my points, here's my trip for this year's birthday (not trying to brag, I can show how to do it): an around the world trip from US to Japan, Thailand, Qatar, and back, all business class on NON-US airline (JAL and Qatar), with airfare of total of only around $3K the entire way around the world, as I got most of my flights with airline and credit card points, also with option of staying at two different high end hotels in Tokyo: **Kimpton Shinjuku** and **Conrad Tokyo** (one of top 10 in all of Tokyo), for 70% off the regular price by using hotel and credit card points.\n\nNot every trip need to be backpack and hostel, its good to treat yourself once in a while, just got to do it strategically.",

I did hostels on one trip back in my college days, never ever again and I completely agree a nice hotel is one of my favorite parts of a trip and a huge aspect of what makes a trip amazing! I do tons of research on them to make sure they are good and usually always try for at-least 4star level properties unless doing a specialty lodging for a specific experience. I always opt to upgrade my train tickets or short flights to first class (long haul if points or cash upgrade offer is worth it) and always always have private car transfers from airports set up, nothing better than walking off a long flight and seeing someone standing there with your name and being whisked away to your hotel without having to think or negotiate or explain where you need to go.",

I need a hotel that feels like I\u2019m doing something a bit indulgent. \n\nI do try to do one slightly excessive experience on every major trip. In the azores, I booked a private ocean fishing boat. After catching the fish, we had a tour of the island to a local park that had a building with a wood stove where the fish was cooked with a full meal with lots of wine. It was magical. I booked a VIP concert at the Mercedes Benz Arena in Berlin. It had an open bar, a formal dinner, and was the highlight of my trip. In Mexico City, I booked a private tour of Teotihuacan with a professor of historical anthropology. I felt like I learned so much. \n\nI really need help choosing my next trip. My favorite trips have incorporated natural attractions and hotels in a more urban area. I loved the Azores, Iceland, and Mexico City. Domestically, I had the best trips to New Orleans, Chicago, and Acadia National Park.",

There was a separate trunk room for the luggage, and the bathroom was all done in black and white marble. Probably the most elegant hotel I've ever stayed at.",

            "comment": "Another photographer here.  I do primarily wildlife photography (with a little landscape and underwater, too).  And wildlife photography usually means big (aka expensive) lenses.  So I'm often traveling with a kit, composed of personally owned or rented gear that costs about as much as a car and weighs about 30+ lbs on its own.\n\nThat rules out a lot of 'backpacker' things.  No shared accommodations, no hostels, no public transport, no onebagging it.\n\nI need a space that's secure enough to leave that gear for times when I'm eating or whatnot.  I also prefer a place that's quiet and has enough room to spread out, stage my gear, and set up a little workspace, as I usually edit my photos from each day in the evening.  That usually means I'm getting either a nice, private AirBnb or a reasonable hotel.  Usually 3 star range, I've stayed in one or two that might have generously been called 4 star, but never seen the point in a 5 star hotel.  I don't care about most amenities, just that there's ample space, safety, and privacy.  An AirBnb is a favorite, though.  With a kitchen and laundry handy, I can take care of the menial things easier and focus on my photography.\n\nI have a favorite AirBnb in Hawaii I've gone back to multiple times.  It's walking distance to a wide array of food, clean and quiet with a great workspace area, and a nice balcony view so I can sit on the lanai and watch the sunset while I edit photos.\n\nMy photography focus also means I tend to splurge for things like priority boarding on the plane, since I cannot risk them running out of overhead bin space and forcing a gate check.  And since I also have some joint problems and getting older (early 40s), I'll pay extra for one of the better legroom seats if available, too.\n\nDepending on the destination, it means I might also be renting a 4x4 vehicle or paying for guides to get where the wildlife is (usually local knowledge is a key factor in successful wildlife photography).  The trip I'm leaving for tonight includes taking a smaller bush plane to the final destination and I have guides booked for the whole week to take me to different wildlife areas.  On another trip, I paid for a helicopter tour to get close to a volcanic eruption for close up and aerial shots of it.  If I'm doing underwater work and diving, I'll pay for dives on the most reputable dive boats I can find.\n\nBut at the same time, I also do some decidedly non-luxury things.  Weight is everything and the camera gear (and scuba if I'm diving) takes priority, so sometimes I'm only traveling with 1-2 change of clothes and I'll rotate and wash them on site (I look for AirBnbs with a washer/dryer, or I'll wash in the sink at a hotel).  So, I'll utilize some more 'onebagger' techniques, but for my checked bag.\n\nI usually eat pretty cheap, too.  Getting to try good local food is a bonus, but not my primary focus and I have no shame about grabbing fast food or just packing a lunch bag so I can hurry up and get to my photography.  I might splurge for one night at a nice restaurant towards the end of my trip, though, just to wind down.\n\nIt didn't always use to be quite this way.  Things used to be a lot more shoestring (and still are when I'm traveling domestically by car, in which I'm either camping or staying at Motel 6s for their dog-friendliness).  In my twenties, I spent a lot of time sleeping on the floor in a shared hotel room with other friends going to see concerts.  But as I've gotten older (and worked my way up in my career), I've been able to splurge more.  This trip, my flight home I splurged for a business class upgrade for the first time in my life.  I'm gonna be exhausted after a week in the jungle, so I figured... why not see what all the fuss is about?\n\nI'm not sure all this qualifies as... you know... instagram worthy 'luxury' travel.  But it works for me.  I'm pretty single minded about these things and I'm willing to shell out cash in service of my goals.\n\nIt helps that I'm single, no expensive boyfriend, no kids, and have a decent remote tech job with a very understanding boss, though.",

I'd go out sightseeing in the morning but spend time at the hotel mid day lounging at the pool (and napping), then go out late night.  \n\nI also stayed at a Marriot beach resort in Phuket but that was only $80/night.  It advertises five star but was more like 4, but still plenty nice. Three swimming pools, on the beach.  They didn't care if you brought your own liquor either.  Met a few people there and we went out for dinner/bars nearby, had fun.\n\nWhen I first got the card, they gave me 3 free nights anywhere for spending a certain amount and I stayed at the Hyatt Andaz in Amsterdam, which would have been 600euros a night.  Free wine in the evenings and food too (practically dinner!).  Free coffee and snacks in the room, of high quality. And free loner bicycle which I used a lot.  Also great location.\n\nMy travel is pretty average priced otherwise.  I'll splurge for a nice dinner somewhere but otherwise just eat casual or in Europe I'll most often buy food at local markets and eat/drink wine in the parks.",

And even when I was in my 20s I did not stay in hostels really, and the few times I did, it was private room or I was with enough people to fill up a 4-6 bed dorm. \n\nI find it pretty crazy to spend ridiculous amounts  on hotels (like 1,000+ a night, except certain resorts/honeymoon,etc\u2026) but I have no problem spending several hundred a night (in the States/Europe) or like 50+ in SE Asia and actually getting a nice room. \n\nI also spend a lot on food and drinks. Budget traveling has its place but my philosophy has always been, even when I was younger, that I\u2019m on vacation and I brought all this money to spend it. That\u2019s still how I view it. I\u2019m not irresponsible, I spend money that\u2019s allowed for the trip, but it\u2019s usually a lot and I have no desire to travel while pinching pennies. \n\nBut I understand it\u2019s different if one is traveling for months and months at a time. I did two six weeks trips in my early 20s but since then it\u2019s always been 1-2 weeks. So I can ball out for 1-2 weeks. \n\nGoing to Vietnam this summer for the first time and I\u2019ll be staying exclusively at hotels, pretty nice ones, and it\u2019s all like 50 bucks a night so I\u2019m excited about that. \n\nI once stayed in this ridiculous room in Rome on Via Vaneto (I think it\u2019s called) and we had a suite and it was pretty awesome. Don\u2019t remember the hotel but it was great. I asked a worker where to buy cigarettes and he noticed what kind I smoked and he just showed up five minutes later with a plate and cigarettes on the plate. \n\nSea View House in Doolin, Ireland was one of my favorite stays. Lovely couple who owns the inn and it\u2019s very quaint and charming, right by the ocean and the Cliffs of Moher.",

Started off with decent hotels and have moved to luxury-ish travel as my wallet can compensate after many years of working. \n\nI save the hostels for group trips into more remote areas before wilderness backpacking or rock climbing adventures. Otherwise, I stay at 4-5 star hotels, fly business internationally (us-based), eat at Michelin starred places, but still find hole in the wall or street vendors that are yummy, free or cheap activities, and also use public transportation to wander the cities. For me it's really about the mood of the trip and what I'm feeling.\n\nI'm headed to Barcelona and Frankfurt at the end of the month. Looking forward to staying in hotel 1898 that is right off La Rambla. I'm staying at the Sofitel Frankfurt Opera in Frankfurt. \n\nI really enjoyed Derrybeg bed and breakfast in Pitlochry, Scotland. Not super fancy and a smaller room but great view of the area and a phenomenal breakfast. Also went to the Michelin starred restaurant nearby for a fantastic dinner. \n\nCosta Rica was amazing. I really enjoyed checking out the southern part of the country for its natural beauty.  Stayed at oxygen jungle villas (adults only). Restaurant there was really good too.",

I tend to favour Travelodge/Premer Inn/Holiday Inn kind of hotels, and just like being comfortable. \n\nI just don't care for hostels, never have. It's cool if others do, but it bugs me how many people on this sub seem to think that you're not *really* experiencing solotravel unless you bunk up in a dorm or \"get to know people\".\n\nI also take public transport and stuff like that when I travel. Plus if you *really* want to \"live like a local\" (LOL), a ton of them use public transport. Nothing like being crammed in on a London Underground train during rush hour...\n\nAlso, I count house/pet-sitting as solo travel. The person I know gets their house/pets looked after while they're away, and I get a comfy place to stay (to myself! for free!), while also getting to explore the city. (Lap cats are a nice bonus, too.) There are a couple of cities I've explored quite a bit by house/pet-sitting for family and friends. Some of them kindly even pay my train fare too! I can shop at the supermarkets for food etc to keep costs down, and spend my money on local attractions. Plus, I get good recommendations from the family/friend who lives there. \n\nHonestly, some of my favourite hotel experiences solo have been just having what I needed to be comfortable. Air conditioning when it's hot. (I'm British and homes don't tend to have air conditioning here.) Peace and quiet, because I live in a shared house so silence is pretty hard to come by unless everyone's out. A good location has been good, when I've stayed in city hotels right on the bus route into town or within walking distance of tourist sites. A hotel having its own restaurant is good too, if I don't feel like going out somewhere to eat.",

With points, deals, etc, I'd get club floors, amazing pool facilities, and luxury gyms. Onsite restaurants were often awesome (esp the champagne brunches or sushi restaurants with awesome deals like weekend buffets). Morning gym and spa/sauna, a \nfree international luxury breakfast, sightseeing, followed by a pool hour, (free) cocktails in the lounge, and an amazing dinner made for pleasant trips, to say the least.\n\nMy best scores flight wise were a $2k return first class ticket between New York and London (AA Flagship), a $1k F ticket from Singapore to Syndey (British Airways), and a $650 biz ticket from Colombo to Auckland via Singapore and Syndey (Sri Lankan and Qantas). On points, they were a mixed biz/first with biz from Auckland to Hong Kong via Singapore with a First Class return from HK to Melbourne on Singapore Air, incl their A380 suite, with the onward to Auckland leg on Emirates in First on their 380.",

My favourites so far are Hotel France d\u2019Antin Opera (tiny 4 star steps away from Palais Garnier, Paris), and an AirBnB minutes away from Spanish Steps in Rome.

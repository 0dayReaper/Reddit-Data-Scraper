Just today: a taxi in Hanoi wanted 2x the price of a grab car. Sometimes, drivers want 4x. It makes airport arrivals so much easier too.\n\nBonus shout out: Multi-country esim",

I know it's popular to dunk on Uber as a company (and let's be clear - they definitely DO have some shady practices), but I feel that people forget (or are too young) to remember just how shitty taxis in most places were.\n\nTaxis - overcharging scams, cash only (or suspiciously \"broken\" credit machines), wrong change scams, luggage scams, wrong destination scams, no route tracking, no visibility into if a taxi was actually going to show up if you called for one, have to fuck around with payment at the end, no real complaint adjudication, having to research cab companies and contacts before landing in a new city, aggressive drivers refusing trips on the regular etc. etc.\n\nThe ride-sharing services heavily mitigate (if not outright eliminate) most of those problems - and they're often cheaper to boot.",

It always felt so unsafe as well as a single female if I caught one home from the clubs.\n\nWith Uber I can usually get one within 5-15 mins. I know what car to be on the lookout for. I can see how far away they are. I can have someone else pay for the Uber if I need to. And I feel WAY safer knowing I have all the driver details saved if something happens.",

Went to Hanoi earlier this year too, and the Grab bike options were super convenient and cheap!\n\nGrab in my own country is a bit pricey though, mostly because they have the monopoly in the market.

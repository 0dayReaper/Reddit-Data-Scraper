    "postText": "I apologise if this is a tired topic. Just a little overwhelmed here and wondered if anyone would be kind enough to help. Trying to get over a breakup and I rarely do anything nice for myself so I figured a trip to Montreal could be enjoyable for my 30th. I've always wanted to go so perhaps this will make the birthday a little more memorable. \n\nI'm from England, though will be travelling from Toronto via car. I haven't quite planned anything thoroughly yet so I'd be grateful for any help I can get. \n\nI'm planning to visit from the 19th of May to the 22nd of May and I'll be on a semi strict budget (at least for food and accommodation. \n\nI'm open to hotels/hostels so I can socalise with other travellers (even better if they have private rooms but not a deal breaker). Are there any ideal ones that anyone can reccommend? \n\nMy social skills are probably 7/10 on a good day, maybe 8/10 after a beer so it would be great to know if anyone could suggest some good bars/party scenes where I can meet new people. I like electronic music like D&amp;B/House though open to all kinds really. \n\nI'm also bi so open to try some LGBT nightlife areas too!\n\nOther than bars and parties I need to figure out how to feed myself on a budget. Eating out would be nice and any good/cheap takeout places would be ideal too (if I'm not in the mood for a solo date with myself). \n\nAlso any idea as to what I could do during the day? I heard there are some nice museums and such, which I'd be more than happy to go to, though as I'll be there for 3 days I was curious if there was anything extra I could do to soak up my time before it gets dark? \n\nThanks  a lot!",

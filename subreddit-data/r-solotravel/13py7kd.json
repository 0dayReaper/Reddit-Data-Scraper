    "postText": "Does someone have experience with the Laugavegur trail in Iceland? I want to hike the trail around the 16th of June, but I read on many places online that the trail may not be open at that time. They tell you that it is depenable on the weather in the surrounding area. \n\n  \nHowever when I look at the bustickets to het starting point of the trail, I see that they start selling them at around the 15th of June. Is it a fixed date that the Laugavegur trail opens at that date or is it possible that the bus tickets will be cancelled due to the weather?\n\n  \nThanks in advance!",

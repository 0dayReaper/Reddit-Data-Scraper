    "postText": "Hey guys!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am biking 2000 KM across Japan alone for the next few months and I'm going to be writing updates about my journey. I left the town of Izumi and started my journey towards Kumamoto. I have attached photos to add visuals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the countryside, I was surprised that there were many stalls that sold items without a cashier. At one of the fruit stalls you simply take a bag of oranges and leave 500 yen in a box. No one is watching and everything is based on the honor system. I don't know of many places where you expect people to be so honest! When I was taking a few photos of the stall the farmer noticed and came out to greet me. She gave me a few oranges for free!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got to Kumamoto and spent the day exploring the city. I visited Kumamoto Castle. One of the three great castles of Japan and the only castle that has never been taken in any conflict. It was a beautiful sight. I explored the city and found statues of characters from One Piece, A popular anime. During the 2015 earthquake, the writer of the show donated a considerable sum to help rebuild the city, and the statues were created as a thank you from the city.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ended my day with some nice Shoyu Ramen from a local restaurant. Some of the best ramen in Japan. Eating any four-legged animal was banned in Japan due to Buddhist teachings. As the country industrialized there was an excess of farm animals and this ban was lifted. As a result, a popular local dish became popular called Basashi, raw horse meat.  It didn't have a strong taste, a little sweet almost like tuna. They gave me plenty of sauces to spice it up! A very interesting city that I was happy to visit! My legs have been sore so it was nice to be able to get some rest here. Not as eventful as my last post, but a nice place to explore and catch my breath. :)\n\nI have footage of this segment of the trip, but I'm not allowed to link the video here, if anyone wants to see it feel free to DM me.",

            "comment": "2000k km over a few months sounds like a nice pace. I did the United States (VA to OR) back in 2014. It was definitely an experience, we did it slower than some groups do it so it took us about 2.5 months. \n\nIf this is your first long distance tour, you might get a bit blind sided by the \"week two depression\". Our guide book mentioned it and it definitely hit me hard. We had just made it over one of the most difficult parts (Appalachian Mountains) and I tried to tell everyone I was quitting and was going to head back home. Took an extra two days in a small mountain city, caught a movie, and got myself motivated again. \n\nIf you need to take some of those mental health days, don't worry about it. The road isn't going anywhere. Or if you find a city you just really want to experience more, let yourself have a little break. But not for so long that you'll never want to hop on the bike again, lol.",

As of now it's slightly better but still not pleasant. I do hope it gets better than this since I will reach Rome one way or another, I just prefer if I had some fun on the way there.",

                            "comment": "So the book said it was normal to feel depressed or defeated during the first two week period. It's kind of like if you've been out of shape for a bit and you start hitting the gym today. Forming that routine is the hardest part. During that first two weeks, you start to really understand the breadth of the journey you put at your feet, and you start to think about how this is going to be your life for the foreseeable future, and how much that last hill climb sucked. Leading up to the trip, at least for me, I was almost entirely just fantasizing about the highlights. And getting to the end and how any amount of pain would be worth it to carry this achievement into my future. I'll tell you what, the steep climbs of the East Coast U.S put a damper on that real quick. \n\nOnce you get to the middleground where you're used to the routine, the rides don't feel as endless and you start to take more joy in the little things, you start to feel like you're on an adventure and not a slog.",

I wasn't going solo (though riding with my brother and father came with its own challenges, to where I often wished I was riding solo instead). For me I think, as I had more of a mountain biking background, I was ready for the physical challenge of day in and day out road biking, but I was less ready for the mental challenge. For me it's much easier to forget your worries on a mountain bike because I am more focused on the immediate task at hand. On the road bike my mind can wander a bit more, and I found that on the days where I was in a bad mood, it was very hard to kick. Which meant for a while that waking up for the next ride and realizing that I was in for another day became a challenge. \n\nthe feeling did pass. Getting to the midwest was a huge turning point. The scenery really opens up as compared to the East coast.",

Starting off in Virginia it was a bit stressful because we had to cross some major roadways until we got further west, and then you're either going up and down steep river valleys in pretty thick forest, or corn fields. Between the two mountain ranges you have to cross it's pretty much that. And then Kansas is a real long, slightly uphill, flat expanse broken up by cattle ranches.\n\nGetting to Colorado is where you start to understand how big the U.S is. Still mostly flat, but just massive sky and mountains and you'd think you're a thousand miles away from civilization until you drop down another slope and there's a mountain town with 15 buildings total but one of them is a bar/restaurant with craft beer lol. The east coast is definitely a lot more like Europe because you can go 10 miles and pass through a city, farmland, and then a state forest. Where in Montana you can go 10 miles and the mountains you've been looking at never seem to get any closer. \n\nhttps://micmead91.myportfolio.com/bike-trip got some pictures of it, for some reason the adobe site kind of scrambled them out of order.

I already have a crossbody purse that I like for travel, but this will be my first time solo for multiple days. The bag I have is not slash resistant though it does have RFID protection; should I buy a slash resistant bag for London? I will be using public transport quite a but, and I wonder if I'm being paranoid about this.",

What locals actually watch out for is people stealing bags that are unattended at bars, restaurants etc. If you spend time in Soho for example, bars will have signs saying \"be careful bag thieves operate here\". Just take basic precautions i.e. watch your bag / have it on your person at all times and op should be fine.",

If yes then honestly I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it.

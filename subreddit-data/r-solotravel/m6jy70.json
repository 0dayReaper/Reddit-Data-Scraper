You will make friends everywhere (usually much easier when alone because you are more motivated to talk to strangers), and the absolute pure freedom of being able to do anything you want, whenever you want is intoxicating and a true pleasure. The world is much safer than you think and traveling solo is way more fun than you probably imagine.",

I found it to be a nice balance, and the changes were refreshing.",

The two girls didn\u2019t stop complaining and telling us how we\u2019d get food poisoning and ruin their holiday. They were playing it \u201csafe\u201d, and going to KFC. \nSo we split off, and got our lunch from the cart, then met up with them eating theirs.\n\nTwo of us DID indeed get food poisoning that day - the two that ate at KFC. \n\nI feel like I missed out on so much by going with them. They won\u2019t get out of their own comfort zone, to actually experience things.\n\nWhen I did my first solo trip to Europe, they made thinly veiled posts on social media about \u2018how pathetic\u2019 I was that I had to travel alone, since no one wanted me. \n\nMeanwhile I was too busy at a table for one in a top rated Polish restaurant in Krakow, enjoying my wine and pierogi, to give a damn what they thought.",

It was a relief to finally walk away for good!\n\nDuring our second trip, to Hawaii, where the other sister took her boyfriend, and I shared with the twin, the boyfriend took a conversation he wasn\u2019t involved in, out of context, to mean I didn\u2019t want to be there with them. Then proceeded to be openly rude/hostile towards me, especially once he realised that the girls didn\u2019t care enough about me to either tell him to cut it out or actually stand up for me.\n\nAt one point he literally yelled at me to \u201cshut the fuck up, bitch!\u201d when I used my 5 years experience at my own job, to explain why his opinion of something happening in front of us was incorrect - literally just \u2018nah, that\u2019s not going to work\u2019. In public, in front of the tour group we were joining, his girl and her sister. He did it again in a rental car when I explained how 4-way stop signs work (I\u2019m a professional driver, he wasn\u2019t), when he said he was confused by it.\n\nThey threw sand at me when I wanted to sit in the shade at the beach because I burn easily, but they were more than welcome to sun bake  as long as they liked.\n\nThey\u2019d go shopping for junk food for our rooms and put in together to get enough for them, but not me. In queues for programs or souvenirs, they\u2019d look after themselves, and leave me to queue for my own.\n\nEven my roommate started complaining how \u2018unfair\u2019 it was that she was \u2018stuck\u2019 with me for activities - right in front of my face - and then acted surprised when I called her out on it.\n\nOn the return flight they checked in together, while I was seated alone, several rows away, and when we arrived home their luggage came out first, so they left me at baggage claim, knowing I didn\u2019t have a ride home as my family wouldn\u2019t be waiting for me.\n\nWhen I removed the boyfriend from my friends list on social media, he used his girl\u2019s profile to snoop, found my ex, sent a friend request, and snooped that profile too. Then left public messages, pretending to be his girlfriend, insinuating that I was lying about having ever been in a relationship with that person. All with her full knowledge, who of course thought it was funny.\n\nWhen I was invited to the house she owned with her sister a few weeks after our holiday - which he\u2019d recently told me to stay away from - I told her I\u2019d appreciate if she put a stop to his behaviour, as it was pretty childish. I hadn\u2019t been rude to him, or called him names, or swore in his face, but if he did it again I wouldn\u2019t let it slide, and she wouldn\u2019t like what I had to say to him, regardless of who was around to hear it.\n\nHer response was that he was her boyfriend (of 6 months), and I was *nothing* (friends for 16 years), so why would she do anything for me?\n\nThat moment changed everything for me. It was like a weight was lifted. \n\nI\u2019d known for most of the 16 years, that that was indeed true. I was a friend of convenience. When I was inconvenient - like if I wanted support or someone to come with me to something that might have been important to me, but not to their taste, then the answer was \u201cwe\u2019ll get back to you\u201d, which I learned meant no. A few times it was an outright, \u201cHell no. I\u2019M NOT doing that (even though you\u2019ve done that for us)\u201d. I\u2019d had more than one person incredulous that I was friends with them, because they knew someone who knew them and said they weren\u2019t nice people.\n\nThey cracked jokes about a medical condition I have. They gaslit me like crazy, and if I ever asked them to stop their behaviour, the retort was always that they were better than me in some way, and I was just jealous of them.\n\nBut, finally, the mask had slipped, and the words matched their actions. \n\nFinally she\u2019d admitted what I\u2019d known for years. \n\nI left their house that night and never returned. I gave up the whole group of friends they were central to, and remained silent on social media while they badmouthed me both online and in person. \n\nEven their mother refused to speak to me when we worked together, who knows what lies she was told, but I was never anything less than polite to her. \n\nOnly one person ever asked for my side of the story - and acknowledged that he had seen the same behaviours I had experienced. He said he\u2019d keep in touch, and encourage his wife to as well, but she felt torn, as we\u2019d all been school friends. \n\nThey were all settling into long term relationships, buying houses and starting families, while none of that was on the horizon for me - and still isn't. So I told him to tell her to pick them. They had more in common in where they were in life, so I\u2019d make the choice for her, and that way she didn\u2019t have to feel bad for picking a side. \n\nI\u2019ve not heard from any of them in 10 years now. They\u2019ve had kids, married and one became widowed. I\u2019ve travelled to 20+ countries. Made friends around the globe, and travelled with them too. There are very few places these days where I could land and not have a contact to meet up with, or even a couch to sleep on. \n\nOur lives are very different these days, but I think we\u2019re all better off apart, instead of forcing something that wasn\u2019t healthy.",

Dont miss Bryce Canyon in between the two, its really incredible. My advice is either drive or rent a car depending where you're coming from and take the backroads as often as possible, thats where the real adventures are hiding. Take the Burr Trail if possible, its awesome.",

So i just bought my ticket and left. There are ups and downs but im so glad i did the trip today because after COVID i can tell myslef that at least i  travlled before something happened. Once things open up more ill be sure to try and travel more.\n\nI also agree that it is nice being on your own time. Some of my friends arent the most time saving people and i could just imagine howd theyd be during a trip. If we had to be somewhere at 10 some of them would sleep till 9:45 or someone would have to wake them up.",

I answer that I am never really alone, as I quickly meet tourists from all parts of the world.  I also hit the local travel agencies in the foreign country and book group trips, tours etc and meet lots of people.  Solo traveling is a great adventure and tons of fun and also culturally educational.",

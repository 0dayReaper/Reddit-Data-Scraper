    "postText": "So I met an amazing girl at a hostel at London. She's from the US doing an exchange in Paris and I study in Barcelona. (We're both 21 yo). We both stayed in London for the weekend. We had an amazing connection, we enjoyed together every night, we had fun, walked in the nights of London, everything was so romantic and beautiful. Idk it felt like we could talk to each other forever and that we would never run out of topics to talk about. After the trip ended we  decided that we wanted to see each other again so I invited her to my place in Barcelona and we spend another weekend there a couple of weeks later. We shared even more time together this time and I guess all the feelings we felt for each other grew even more. She's leaving soon to the US. It's been 4 days since she left Barcelona and I just miss her so much. I've cried and have being nostalgic all week. I'm happy that it happened but I can't help to also feel sad that this beautiful experience ended. There's something so heartbreaking about meeting someone so special and just having to accept  you can't be together because of your circumstances. I know we're both very young, and that you may think \"it was just a couple of days thing\" but we felt it, and we know it was real and important to us. At least I can say that she was my first love and I'll always have a fond memory of her no matter what. It would be helpful if anyone that has been through a similar experience has any tips or has any thoughts for this type of situations. \n\nNote: I'm currently living in Spain but I often visit my parents who live in Mexico which is closer to the US in case that is a factor to analyze.",

After dinner we walked to a store where our daughter works, and walked home with her after she got off work.\n\nIt was a fun evening.\n\nThe magic doesn't have to end when the traveling ends.",

I\u2019ve traveled alot and lived in a bunch of different countries met loads of different people and have many similar experiences to the one you have described with so many different people! You will feel this connection with sooooo many people! Have fun with it! \n\nsaying bye is hard but the world is small and you will likely meet again. And as I say your gonna have loads of these kinds of experiences! So try not to get too upset, appreciate the time together, say goodbye, have a cry, keep in touch, and keep your heart and mind open and move on to the next great connection! And maybe later down the line you will get together again, who knows!",

I'm sure we'll see again more times and who knows, maybe when we're a bit older we can figure out something. Nostalgia is heartbreaking but I'm grateful I got to live such a beautiful connection.",

One aspect I really enjoy about solo travel is being able to have a romantic flair if it ever arises (while being single).  I'm roughly twice the age of OP and have had my fair share of romantic/crush/flirtatious engagements, none of them have materialized.  I know they can potentially turn into lasting loyal relationships but I believe part of the kinship is that you're both in a very new place, you really have no other obligations/commitments and have a carefree attitude while out on vacation.  When the other variables of life get involved, you find out the other half has a different side to them.  \n\nI met a girl half way around the world who was from my same hometown.  When we returned, she wanted to continue hanging out.  First night out, she's doing drugs right in front of me.\n\nMet a girl in Portugal from Japan.  We had some very romantic banter and nights out.  When I visited Japan, I reached out to her.  We met up and the feeling was more of a platonic feeling and her personality was not as bubbly as I remembered (prob the fact that she was just going through the daily motions and here I was on vacation).",

Had a nice chat then realized we would both be in Amsterdam 2 weeks later so we decided to meet up.  Had a wonderful day where we really connected.  Alas, that was the end of my Europe trip.\n\nA few months later she was visiting friends in the US and had some time so she decided to pop up for a few days.  There we really hit it off.  Although brief, it was a strong connection.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nWe had a long chat about could we make it work but the circumstances were too difficult.  As everyone knows, long distance sucks and we decided it wasn't worth it without some sort of end game in mind.  It was hard.  We discussed just cutting off communication so we don't torture ourselves.  Just keep it as one short but beautiful relationship (as someone else mentioned, watch \"Before Sunrise\").  In the end we decided to stay in touch.  And I had such a good time on my first Europe trip (not just with her) I was already thinking about doing a bit longer Europe trip the next year.  So during my travels I of course made a stop in Germany.  Some in her hometown, also some travelling together.  Had an absolutely amazing time together.  In total is was about 2 weeks.  But once again, we faced a very difficult conversation.  As much as I liked/loved her, I wasn't ready to move to Germany for a girl I still hadn't spent that much time with.  We ended up spending a whole evening in Paris discussing if we could practically make it work.\n\nSo we came up with a plan.  We would try long distance while she finished her last year of University.  If that went well, she would come to Canada for a \"gap\" year to work and travel and we could give us a real try.  If things still went well then I would go to Germany for a year.  Both commitments were temporary and would be cool life experiences even if the relationship didn't work out.\n\nUltimately, things didn't go exactly to plan with Covid.  But long story long...we are now happily married and starting a family.  It wasn't always easy, we have both made some sacrifices but ultimately neither of us regret any of it.",

It's impossible to know after such a short time with someone, is it only a honeymoon phase or is it \"true love\".  It might work out, it might not.  Everyone has to find their own journey.  We were fortunate, it really worked out for us.  It made the sacrifices worthwhile.  All I can share is my experience and what I learned along the way:\n\n1) Our relationship continued to grow during the year between meeting and deciding to go for it.  Not romantically necessarily but I got to know her better which was valuable.  I think we learned that we were compatible on a more normal level, not just in the new relationship sheen.  \n\n2) We found ways to remove some of the pressure on the relationship.  In our 2nd long conversation deciding whether or not to give a try, I still wasn't ready to move to Germany for her and I couldn't ask her to move to Canada just for me.  That was where our plan came in.  We set up relatively low risk steps where if it didn't work out, it wouldn't set us back too far individually.  She also said during the conversation that she had always considered doing a \"gap\" year to work and travel before starting her career.  She enjoys travelling and she said it would be still be a valuable experience for her even if we didn't work out.  To me this was really important.  If one person sacrifices too much, it can put pressure and a sort of imbalance on the relationship which I don't think is healthy.  There could always be a sense of \"I did more for you than you did for me\".  We tried to limit this as best we could.  \n\n3)  I realized at some point during our time in Paris that if we didn't at least give it a shot, I would always wonder.  Knowing myself, I would probably compare future relationships to her.  That probably isn't the healthiest for future relationships either.  So this realization combined with our plan (and her saying she wanted to travel not solely for me), was what convinced me to go for it.  From then on, I was all in and haven't looked back.  Her too.  \n\n4) Lastly, it's very clich\u00e9 but communication is key to any relationship.  Be open and honest with one another.  It's important for all relationships but especially for long distance.  \n\nFYI, time differences really suck.  We had 8 hours for most of it and the only time we were both awake for any extended time, I was at work.   She always woke up right when I was going to bed and would go to bed just as I was getting off work.  We would often chat for a bit when I was in bed and she was on the train to school.  We mostly used weekends.  But you have to find time somewhere.  \n\nHope this helps.  Feel free to message me about anything.  Good luck with however you decide to move forward :)",

It doesn't have to turn into anything more, sometimes life is all about these small/temporary moments/memories. Nothing is forever anyway, life itself isn't permanent/has a ticking clock to it. \n\nI did end up meeting a few other people I connected with in my travels (romantically). I will say every connection has been different (different kinds of special). So write about your experience and moments with this girl in your travel journal, and turn the page to writing about new experiences you'll encounter from here on. Cheers",

            "comment": "I met someone while living in England on a temporary work visa, and didn't tell him I had a job lined up in Brazil. My logic was so we could date naturally. It was starting to get a bit serious after 3 months and he was upset when I told him right before and kind of turned cold. However I was honest and said I know I love you, let's stay in touch. \nHe was a model so I figured I could never keep him, just let it be...and sure enough a month later he was visiting in Brazil for 2 weeks. We did long distance for a year, then I moved back to London. Slogged away as an illegal worker for years, not wanting to force marriage on him. Finally said this is wrecking my career, my future, moved to home country, left it open like before Brazil, and same thing, a month later he was there visiting.\n\nWe did 5 years of this until I didn't care about the stereotype of girl who says put a ring on it - I said I'm going to get deported then we're really screwed we need visas, period. We got married at registrar in UK and stayed together happily for 7 more years.\n\nI divorced him after trying really hard to make it work in the end. The bottom line: we never would've married if we hadn't had to. Maybe we'd be together actually, because we would've done it naturally in time.\n\nI so relate to you friend:)\nMy point is that different nationalities shouldn't matter, love is love, but that kind of pressure - and the romanticism of the long distance thing (that includes friends finding it 'so romantic') - can be a big influence. \nThe thing I did, of walking away and letting it breathe, twice, is what made us sure it was real love. It was so hard to do and took a lot of faith and hope. If you two want to be together, be willing to have those times of separation. Back then there were no video calls! We wrote letters! Yes, very romantic. Lots of patience. But don't give up.\n\nTo note: the divorce was bc as some people on here mentioned, you never truly know who you're compatible with for the big things, the big values, the long haul, when your house is built on shifting sands as they say. \nYou'll hear many different experiences; go with your heart!",

We met a guy (we'll call him Will), late 20s, and they connected..he changed his itinerary to match ours for a week... They spent a week together and fell in love. They lived across the world from each other, and we were all struggling financially, and she was pursuing 2 graduate degrees. But that connection remained. My friend would date, but if Will was traveling anywhere within 500 miles, my girlfriend would meet him (and vice versa), and they'd plan a vacation around it. They made music for each other, sent care packages, spent hours on the phone each month (when long distance costs were so ridiculous), and were truly soul mates. Anyway, this went on for over a decade. Finally, the guy got engaged and married. My best friend never did. She got close, but I never saw her connect with another person the way she did with Will. \n\nMy advice: Stay in touch, be there for each other, give each other space to experience life (without jealousy or control issues), celebrate each other's accomplishments, try to connect at least once a year and if the feelings remain strong and true. Take the plunge. Put the relationship first. See what happens. Life is short and amazing people you love deeply are few.",

He is from London and I am from the states. We had 3 nights of magic. Connection, passion, fun, excitement, respect. The instant connection was unlike anything I\u2019ve ever experienced before. We have kept in touch over the years. I\u2019d be dating someone and he\u2019d be single and then vice versa. Months, years would go by and either I\u2019d reach our or he would. Recently I texted him - about two weeks ago.  We have been reminiscing about those nights, trying our hardest to remember each second of our time spent together back then on that island. Each time we chat it\u2019s as if we pick up right where we left off. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s healthy or realistic or just a fantasy. All I know is the pull towards each other never stops. \n\nI\u2019d say, don\u2019t ignore your feelings. Don\u2019t just brush it off. It\u2019s real and if you can make it work go for it! We have one life and feelings like that aren\u2019t something to take for granted. As for me, I wish I would\u2019ve taken my own advice written above. \ud83e\udd0d",

We had two weeks together and we were so connected the way you were with the girl from US. He went back to Europe after the project but I stayed in Latin America for another project. We kept the contact afterwards and met again in the US three months later, had a road trip, then head back to our home countries. We decided to step back and just be friends because of \u2018the circumstances\u2019 as you said. It was heartbreaking. What I did was that I spent a whole month (\u2018luckily\u2019 I was in covid confinement and waiting for a visa to start a new life in another country so no need to worry about work) going through messages of the meaningful conversations we had (science, politics, philosophy, consciousness, etc.) plus my volunteering and travel experience during those months, and write a 400-page book dedicated to him. The whole process of writing things down gave me so much nostalgic joy and peace. This month, after more than three years without seeing each other, he visited me in the city where I currently live (still in Asia). When we were together, it felt like time had never passed. Since I\u2019m in a transition period right now and already quit my job, I\u2019m seriously planning to move to his city, without compromising what I want to do for my own life. \n\nYou never know what the future would look like. \nI would advice you to first try not to contact for a month, it\u2019s super hard but it helps so much to put yourself together (that\u2019s what I did, but tell her you\u2019re doing this intentionally so that she wouldn\u2019t misunderstand you), after that, keep contact with her, but just as a very close friend. it\u2019s a waste to disconnect a wonderful connection, just be sure it\u2019s not merely hormonal. Don\u2019t restrict yourselves from dating other people and don\u2019t get jealous. Give each other the freedom to explore (especially that you both are so young. More than a decade younger than I am!). Nothing is good by force. \n\nMeanwhile, focus on your own personal growth so that one day you have the freedom to design your own life, to be wherever you want, with whoever you want. Just my advice if you really feel this is something truly remarkable. Most likely you\u2019ll be fine and meet someone else that you fell in love with soon. Time is the best medicine especially for young guys. Good luck, feel better soon!",

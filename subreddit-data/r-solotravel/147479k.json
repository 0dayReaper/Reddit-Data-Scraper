I booked the whole thing, in one go, before I could talk myself out of it again. Now I'm finally going, and I'm really nervous I messed something up with the flight tickets or hotels and I'll have to double check everything but yeah.... I'm finally doing it!!\n\nI'm getting out of my comfort zone. I've been worrying about feeling lonely, until I realized, heck, I feel lonely at home too, might as well feel lonely in Japan! I might get sick and feel bad, but I feel sick and bad at home too, might as well feel physically like shit in South Korea instead!\n\nGuys I'm goiiiiing \\~\\~\\~ aarrrghhh",

If it's any reassurance, both countries have a lot of pharmacies/drug stores through the cities. Wishing you fun adventures in Japan and Korea, they're great countries to solo travel in.",

I just learned this trip to always book stuff with free cancellation if at all possible. I also wish I had gotten an internet package, as I relied too much on Wi-Fi, and a couple times I used my data for directions when it was time sensitive (i.e. I had a tour).\n\nSo nothing major, but things I will remember for my next trip.",

And there will probably be missed opportunities and lost money. But I realized, well, I can take the trip and accept these things will happen, or I can never go. So I decided to go anyway. I have a little small kitchen in the first two hotels so can make my own food if necessary. I won't be dining out too much, I'll buy a lot of onigiris from the convenience store I think... And most of my tours will just be walking around town, in parks, on (short) walking trails in nature, visiting temples/museums nearby etc.\n\nI think this is where traveling solo is gonna be good for me compared to group tours. I can decide what and when I eat, how far I walk, etc. whereas I would probably be ruining the trip for friends or family if I took such precautions.\n\nThankfully my disease fluctuates a lot from month to month and week to week, day to day etc. Some days I feel almost like a normal human being, other days I'm thinking about giving up on my full time job and going on disability lol. Crossing my fingers I will have at least a few days of feeling normal :')",

If you can't handle spice there are surprisingly a lot of mild dishes that you may be able to eat (I live in a city with a gigantic Korean population). One example is juk (essentially porridge); plain white rice, pine nut and pumpkin flavors are made with minimal ingredients and filling, I get them at my local H-mart (along with rice cakes- so many flavors, I've tried unique kinds like mugwort and chestnut and liked them all). Samgyetang (clear broth chicken soup with stuffed with sticky rice), kong guksu (soy milk noodles- sounds strange but trust me it's delicious and easy on the system), kalguksu (popular in markets, knife cut noodles in a clear broth), several kinds of jeon/pajeon (savory pancakes, the potato version is gamjajeon and has no spice at all) may be to your liking. I didn't include meat or seafood heavy dishes but if you're interested I can recommend more. Maangchi's website may be helpful as she lists dishes by category so you can narrow down by nonspicy, vegetarian, sweets, etc. and she provides names in Hangul. I have a wish list of destinations in Korea thanks to watching Youtube (ha) one channel I recently discovered is Alexandra Olesen, she only goes to vegan restaurants/cafes and bakeries and lists them in her descriptions, there's a lot of western style food featured in her vlogs if that's more your comfort zone. I'm sure you've seen all kinds of cafes to visit, Banul Knitting Cafe may be worth checking out, even if you don't know how to knit (I don't but I still want to go after seeing it on another Youtube channel lol). I haven't traveled to Asia solo yet but I did a solo trip to Istanbul and Morocco and had an amazing time and made memories that I'll cherish for the rest of my life. Good luck with your travels, we're all excited for you :)",

Sometimes washrooms don\u2019t have soap though so I recommend the little soap papers you can buy at convenience stores! \n\nKyoto might be a bit more inconvenient, just because you most likely will take the bus more than train so there\u2019s no station washrooms.

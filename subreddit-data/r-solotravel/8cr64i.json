Unfortunately, I had crippling panic attacks every night and opted to end my trip 2 nights short.  I still had a great time during the days, but once the evening hit, all hell broke loose.  I'd love some advice if anyone has dealt with something similar when traveling alone... This was my first solo trip flying out of the Country, and I think having very little freedom over my schedule got to me?  Solo travel isn't anything new to me, I usually have my car, and a lot more control of where I can/am going.\n\nAnyway, I'm sure you don't really want to hear about that part of my trip, and would instead like to hear more about the trip itself!  I ended up spending 3 nights in downtown Banff, snowboarding 1 day and roaming around town/hiking for 1 day.  This picture was taken in downtown Banff around golden hour, the building the closest on the right was my hotel.  It was shot on a Canon 5D Mark II and 50mm lens. \n\nSorry for that little travel rant, but it was something I feel I needed to get off my chest...\n\nEdit:  @BurnsHimselfPhoto is my Instagram if you'd to see some more photography of mine.  I post pretty much daily there, and have been for quite some time now ;)",

Like the post above mine, I suffer from general anxiety disorder too but didn\u2019t have it controlled at the time. Add in the fact that I went in the dead of winter and it was a disaster. Suffice it to say, I can empathize. Something I\u2019ve found is that I try to bring some sense of my \u201cnormal life\u201d to my trips at night and I\u2019ve trained myself not to feel guilty about that. So I\u2019ll be out all day hiking or exploring and at night I\u2019ve started to stay in and take some time to read or watch tv like I normally would. It\u2019s a little change but I\u2019ve had to kind of talk to myself that it\u2019s ok to not go out at night and have that FOMO with nightlife. I just know that my anxiety would get out of hand out in say a club or whatever and my sanity &gt; a cool story about some place I went to at night. Sometimes I\u2019ll plan ahead for dinner reservations somewhere and then go ahead and do my same nighttime routine after. Essentially, I do stuff at night to ground myself and bring my familiar, safe rituals with me. Hope that makes sense, and hope that helps!",

For example, if I don't get enough sleep two days in a row, I will definitely be pretty anxious on that third day. So I try to get sleep. Another example is caffeine - drinking coffee or espresso is a sure fire way to get my anxiety spiked.\n\nThere are those triggers you can't control and for those i use a variety of techniques to work my way out of an anxiety attack although my anxiety in general doesn't go away.  Breathing exercises, yoga, exercise, and mindfulness. Challenging my anxious thoughts. Distraction. \n\nI sought help. Personally, therapists didn't do too much for me but I did consult with one as well as my doctor. I was lucky to meet someone who was not a therapist per say, but she was a life coach and trained in a variety therapy and trauma related healing processes. I didn't get medication although there is some available if you need it. \n\nMy best advice to you would be to read up on some of those things I do (just Google it with 'for anxiety ') and seriously evaluate if you need to talk to someone with regards to the loss you've experienced.

                                    "comment": "What works is different for everyone. After I got hospitalized (before I was officially diagnosed), my typical anxiety symptoms changed slightly to mirror that of what landed me in the hospital - an allergic reaction. I had no idea this could happen (just before I left I had figured out I was dealing with anxiety with help of a counsellor). Cue a ton of panic constantly about my health which then made my anxiety worse which then made my 'symptoms' worse... What a vicious cycle. \n\nThe first step is to make sure your basic needs are met. Listen to your body as anxiety is often trying to yell us something. Did you eat enough today or are you hungry? Are you hydrated? Drinking water or tea is a good idea anyways. Have you gotten enough sleep? Have you moved/exercised? Basic self care stuff.\n\nOften anxiety is triggered by something. Sometimes it's physical, like for me, drinking coffee causes the physical anxiety symptoms to surface. Other times it's reminders of past experiences. Another example is over saturating myself with bad news. I need to take a break and do something else or read good things. I found it helpful to figure out what triggers my anxiety so I can avoid putting myself in that situation or be better prepared to handle it.\n\nI find exercise helps reduce my anxiety and getting enough sleep is crucial for me. \n\nNow, if it's too late and I'm anxious or in the beginning of a panic attack, I do a few things. One, I try to challenge my anxious thoughts - counter them with logic and facts, call out the ridiculousness, think of best case scenario not worst. Second, I'll try to distract my brain - exercise, coloring, funny video, etc. Third, I'll journal about it. Fourth, I'll do yoga or listen to ASMR or do a breathing exercise. I do the inhale for x seconds, hold for x seconds and exhale for x seconds. If you Google anxiety breathing exercises there are some good visuals. Fifth, I will reach out to my support systems, cuddle a cat, etc. Sixth, I do something called mindfulness or grounding, where I focus on body awareness or will go through all my senses and name something I can sense from each - one thing I smell, two things I taste, three things I hear, four things I feel, five things I see.\n\nWhen I'm having a panic attack I focus on breathing. It's all about breathing for me because my scariest/worst symptom is being unable to breathe (again tied into my experience with anaphylactic shock). My other physical symptoms include chest pressure, chest pain, headaches, slight nausea, dizziness, occasionally hyperventilation, throat tightness... much fun. Mentally, I worry a lot and am very self critical. It's a little more complex to describe. \n\nI sought help when I got home from my doctor as well as a few professionals.\n\nSome people love meditation and have different coping methods. Some people find medication helpful. \n\nThere is a book about mindfulness and anxiety I found helpful called: the mindful way through anxiety. \n\nBest of luck!\n\n",

At this point I can recognize the signs pretty easily and normally get it under control but it's much harder when on the road. \n\nWhat I've found helpful, regardless of if I'm travelling or at home, is making sure that throughout the day I've done everything I can to get ahead of my anxiety. Making sure any work or responsibilities get handled is key but so is some really basic shit like grooming, eating, staying hydrated, and sleeping. Ensuring that you're meeting those basic needs can do a world of good.\n\nFor me the most helpful thing though has been medication. Not necessarily taking it, just having it on hand gives me some peace of mind. Knowing that I've got the meds if I need them (and knowing that they work) is incredibly reassuring and has definitely helped me out.",

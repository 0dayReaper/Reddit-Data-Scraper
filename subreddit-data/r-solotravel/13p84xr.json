It was for my 30th bday this year so I kinda really still want to go\u2026 I\u2019ve been looking forward to it for a year. But since it\u2019s a couples resort I\u2019m wondering if it might be really weird for me to go alone. But also because it\u2019s so small it feels like the perfect place to feel safe alone.",

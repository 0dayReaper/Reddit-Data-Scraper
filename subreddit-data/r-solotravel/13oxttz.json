    "postText": "I love Tuk-Tuks. Sure only tourists take them, who cares? They\u2019re convenient, fast, and fun. They\u2019re often the best option.\n\nThis is based on my experience as a man in Bangkok. Here\u2019s how to have a good tuktuk experience:\n\n1. Check how much a Grab would cost\n2. Find a Tuk-tuk (they\u2019re always right there, no need to wait for a car to show up or coordinate pickup, much better than grab)\n3. Negotiate until the price is only slightly higher than a Grab (yay you get to bargain!). If they refuse, walk away. Usually this is when they cave, but if they don\u2019t then just order the Grab.\n4. Important: make sure you have the cash to pay for the ride!\n5. Enjoy your fun rollercoaster ride through the streets of Bangkok! Zooom zooom vrrrm bumpy roads weee! Feel the wind cooling you down and enjoy the nudie ads in the roof.\n\nIn the off-chance they try to pull something, never show weakness and demand to be delivered directly to your destination for the negotiated price. If their little tricks don\u2019t work they realize you\u2019re not a mark and they leave you alone. Worst case, get out and pay for the portion of the trip they\u2019ve completed.\n\n\nOf course it can be hard to communicate where exactly you need to go but usually a minute effort using Google Maps is enough.",

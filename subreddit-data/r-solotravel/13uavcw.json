I have 15 days off work and am trying to fit as much in as I possibly can and have chosen the following European Interail route: Paris -&gt; Amsterdam -&gt; Berlin -&gt; Prague -&gt; Budapest -&gt; Vienna   \n\n\n  \n6 cities in 15 days means that I will be able to go for 3 of them for 2 days and the other 3 for an extra day (3).  \n\n\n  \nFirstly, is this too much in too short a time? Secondly, from your experience which 3 cities would you pick to explore for the extra day (3)?  \n\n\n  \nFor context I am equally interested in your standard touristy sites, history and nightlife (although I\u2019ll be interested to see how that works whilst travelling solo in hostels)",

Although I LOVE Prague, it is the most logistically difficult to get to/from.\n\nIf you were to do Paris\u2014&gt; Amsterdam, it\u2019s about a 3.5 hour train ride.  Leave first thing from Paris, and you could disembark in Brussels on the way up.  Sightsee for about six-eight hours, then take the evening train into Amsterdam.\n\nFrom there, take a flight to Vienna.  After spending four nights in Vienna, take the morning train to Budapest, disembarking in Bratislava.  Spend about six\u2014eight hours in the capital of Slovakia, and take a late afternoon train into Budapest, arriving in the evening.\n\nSo you\u2019d still get six countries, but with a MUCH more compact travel profile, at a pace that\u2019s reasonable\n\n1. Arrive Paris\n\n2 Paris \n\n3 Paris \n\n4 Paris\u2014Brussels\u2014Amsterdam\n\n5. Amsterdam\n\n6. Amsterdam\n\n7. Flight AMS\u2014VIE\n\n8.  Vienna\n\n9. Vienna\n\n10. Vienna\n\n11.

If you haven\u2019t purchased your return ticket yet and you live in the US consider flying back from Paris or London. Do NOT backtrack if you can help it.\n\nWithout knowing where you\u2019ve been before and where home is\u2026 1) try to end the trip where you can fly back with one connecting flight or less. 2) pick 3 places so you don\u2019t waste time at airports and train stations and figuring out check in times at the next place.",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m going on a solo trip to Central and South America leaving in December and getting back sometime mid next year. \n\nI\u2019m currently in the process of working out what backpack to buy and leaning towards a 40L with a 15L daypack. It would be a massive help to know what other people could fit in to their backpack just so I can pick something that\u2019s right for me. \n\nSome things to address in particular: I will hike Machu Picchu will I need to bring hiking boots for this? I\u2019m going to Patagonia, will it be possible to buy cold weather stuff while I\u2019m there or should I be bringing this with me?",

I don\u2019t know about hiking because that area has become touristy so it might be easier than a regular hike. For Monserrat I\u2019m just taking my Tevas or my Hokas. \nIf you are staying in hostels just pack enough for a week or so and do laundry. Most good hostels have facilities.",

In 40L osprey. In general id say you can pack a little lighter than you need and buy things you need. \n\nFor your situation just bring trail runners, its a hike heavy area and i generally dislike bringing multiple shoes. Cant help with the cold weather buying",

I have an Osprey Fairview 70 (yeah I\u2019m not a light packer). I spent 2 weeks in Patagonia so I had to pack some warm clothes which took quite a lot of space in my backpack. For Patagonia I had thermal underwear and good quality socks (Uniqlo), light wind protection jacket that can be rolled into a small bag, hiking shoes, a couple of pairs of long pants etc. Some of that stuff was also useful in San Pedro de Atacama because it was freaking cold at night there. Cusco was also really cold at night, and really hot during the day. I feel like it\u2019s impossible to pack light when you go to South America because in one day you do from +25 to +5 so you have to change clothes at least twice in a day. It\u2019s not SEA where you just need shorts, flip flops and a couple of bikinis\u2026 in South America you have to pack for cold weather, hot weather, rainy weather, windy weather\u2026 So also don\u2019t forget a raincoat, you\u2019ll definitely need it. \n\nBasically pack your bag for both +35 and +5 cause you\u2019ll experience all of that in South America.",

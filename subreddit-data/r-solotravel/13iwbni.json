    "postText": "I was really not planning on taking a vacay this summer/fall but decided to change my mind last minute.\n\nLooking for good vibes, similar to chiang mai or hoi an. Am 28y Male from USA, who will be solotraveling.\n\n**I enjoy fun nightlife, beaches, digital nomading communities, great food, meeting locals, training(muay thai, mma), etc...**\n\nI also do a lot of photography so getting some good video and street photography done would be cool. Drone is optional\n\nCouple spots on my mind (based off price):\n\nLow end: Medellin/cartagena, Portugal\n\nMid end: Costa Rica, Iceland, Akumal\n\nHigh end: Hawaii, Tulum\n\nWouldn't mind asia, but preferably somewhere closer.\nI am actually planning a 6month to 1year asia trip/digital nomad trip at EOY so I would prefer to save that for then.\n\nAny suggestions would be great!",

Tulum is all about Instagram influencers from LA and overpriced beach clubs, Costa Rica is overcrowded with the worst kind of American tourists (not enough time and too much money to spend, that raise the prices to a ridiculous level and ruin it for everyone else).\nI would not recommend it to anyone.",

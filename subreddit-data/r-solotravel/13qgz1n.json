The street art, the restaurants, and real people living their lives was such a joy to see.\r  \n\r  \nI felt proud of myself for figuring out the subway system and when someone asked if I was local I secretly smiled to myself \ud83d\ude0a and when I decided not to take the subway and walk instead, I stumble across so many amazing things that weren't in my plan..a street farmers market, chess in the park, Strand book store, Chelsea Market, and so much more!\r  \n\r  \nI love seeing the classic things I had always seen in movies in real life..NY pizza is no joke! Broadway is worth it! Taxis and honking everywhere. I asked for directions twice and straight got ignored lol. The thick accents. The beautiful diversity. NY bagels...damn, talk about cream cheese!!\r  \n\r  \nIt was one of my favorite trips, and I look forward to going back!!",

Some get caught in bad tourist traps or just stay in Times Square, or they just don\u2019t find their way to the real character places. \n\nYou did great staying in the east village and just wandering. That\u2019s the way to do it. Hope you found your way to Central Park at some point too. \n\nAnd even as a native, I still visit the strand regularly. Best bookstore ever.",

So I\u2019m a native New Yorker and I\u2019m used to the city at night, but there are usually LOTS of people still out and about - I would say it maybe clears out after midnight but even then there are people on the subway going home still. I tend to walk briskly through empty areas but I\u2019m not necessarily scared I\u2019m just trying to whip my way down - but these are gonna be areas like the financial district or city hall area - really anywhere that people just work and then leave. It\u2019s a very walkable city with easy transport. \n\nMy cousin and his gf just visited and I think the reality is that some people can get intimidated by the homeless asking for money, but all you have to do is ignore them or say no and the vast majority of the time they leave you alone. I\u2019ve also been asked for money a lot of times out of the country so it\u2019s basically exactly like that - do whatever you would do in your home city. Also funnily enough any problem I\u2019ve ever had in NYC I had in the daytime and not at night LOL! I think if you want to visit you\u2019ll be fine! Stay in an area that\u2019s easy to reach everything (preferably Manhattan if you can afford it!)",

I was always terrified when somebody approached because my German was at first zilch..

Around 9 in a coffee shop I met up with a group of Americans getting ready to fly out the next morning. I ended up partying with them until the place closed at 11. I've been drinking and smoking all day and now it's time to find my way back to the hotel. I looked at the map of the trams and was completely confused. At that point I started to become a little freaked out about how I was getting back to my hotel on the other side of the city.  \nI'm sure many solo travelers have hit the same point where you realize you need to just concentrate on one step at a time. I found a tram that would bring me closer to where I was. Looked at the map again to find the next tram that brings me closer. A couple times I had to walk a few blocks to the right tram but taking one step at a time got me back to my hotel. I've had many solo trips since then but I'm much more wary about drinking too much. I've never had another lost trip back to a hotel but it was a good learning experience.",

One friend got her green card. They're super excited, but I've been secretly worried about their safety. Your post lets me know that they'll be ok for the most part. I hope New York... well, America, in general... is all they've dreamed of.",

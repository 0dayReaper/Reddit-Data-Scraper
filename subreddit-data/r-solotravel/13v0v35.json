    "postText": "Longtime lurker that's romanticized an extended, solo trip on the other side of the world. Frankly, it should have happened by now, but COVID got in the way. So I'm glad to finally be making this. Presently equal parts excited and anxious, so I'm looking for some support from the community to constructively critique my itinerary in hopes that having an itinerary that I'm fairly confident in will inspire some confidence and move the needle more towards excitement. .\n\nI'll provide a little details about me, my preferences, and my preliminary itinerary.\n\n**My ask of you....**\n\n1. Recommendations for additions/subtractions from the itinerary\n2. Comments on nights in allocated nights to a given location (e.g., add more time in a place or reduce time in a place)\n3. A few recommendations for specific things to do in each location,\n4. Recommendations on neighborhoods to target for lodging in each location\n5. Point out any blind spots (i.e., what factors am I over / underweighting  such as rainy season in SEA, etc.)\n\n**About me:**\n\n* 30M, single, American\n* Work has offered me a sabbatical, making this trip possible; while I technically have 3 months, I'm only willing to dedicate a month to travel so that I have time to focus on other personal goals for this sabbatical time\n\n**Travel preferences:**\n\n* I'm blessed to have a very significant point balance with an international hotel chain's loyalty program (e.g., Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, etc.)\n* I intend to use this point balance to subsidize most (if not all) of my lodging. I'm pretty set on staying in the megachain properties in the big cities, but would consider deviating and going out of pocket in some of the smaller destinations in SEA on my itinerary (e.g., Koh Samui, Chiang Mai)\n* I'm looking for a good mix of culture, street food, restaurants and cocktails, nightlife, meet locals, and natural beauty of course\n* While in Japan, i think i'd enjoy a traditional ryokan / onsen experience; also would consider a night in a monastery--I know I'll have to go out of pocket on lodging here\n* While I'm not keen on hostels, I'd still like to meet people along the way--both platonic and romantic (I'm single); the trip will be long and lonely otherwise; I'm ready to challenge myself to chat up strangers along the way to make this happen\n\n**Itinerary: \\~30 days - beginning in SEA and work up to Japan (early July to early August)**\n\n* Singapore: 2 days (3 nights since I arrive late) \n* Koh Samui: 3 nights *-- plane from Singapore*\n* Bangkok: 3 nights (i'll return before travelling to Tokyo) *-- plane from Koh Samui*\n* Chiang Mai: 3 nights *-- plane from Bangkok*\n* Bangkok: 1 nights *-- plane from Chiang Mai*\n* Tokyo: 5 nights *-- plane from Bangkok*\n* Kyoto: 4 nights *-- train from Tokyo*\n* Osaka: 2 nights *-- train from Kyoto*\n* Tokyo 1 night *-- train from Osaka*\n\n**Okay that's it from me. Again, my ask of you....**\n\n1. Recommendations for additions/subtractions from the itinerary\n2. Comments on nights in location (e.g., add more time in a place or reduce time in a place)\n3. A few recommendations for specific things to do in each location,\n4. Recommendations on neighborhoods to target for lodging in each location\n5.

It\u2019s not going to be cold, it\u2019ll be humid. \n\nIf you want to meet people, I\u2019d suggest doing pub crawls or visiting a hostel that has a bar as a good way to meet other travelers. 30 days will go by really fast so don\u2019t worry about being lonely.\n\nI hope you\u2019re backpacking with a 40 liter backpack. Do not bring luggage, it will weigh you down.\n\nOther than that, I think the amount of days in each city is right on the money; really depends how you are getting from city to city.\n\nI have a post-trip report on SEA in my profile history. Take a look and ask me anything",

Question though, is 40L backpack small enough to fit on budget airlines within SEA? I want to avoid checking luggage at all costs throughout the trip. Is that an unreasonable premise?",

I recommend packing light (only underwear) and bringing 3 pairs of shorts and 3 odor-resistant fabric shirts. I got by SEA with a basketball jersey most of the time. If you need to buy any clothes, SEA has many good, cheap knockoffs. I still wear them to this day lol Also, cut down on the footwear; just bring 1 good pair of sneakers for walking, and a pair of sandals. \n\nYou could eliminate a night in Singapore and add it to Bangkok or the Island depending on your vibe. Honestly, there's nothing much to do there apart from the Tree Garden at night, and a couple of food stalls. I highly recommend eating at this soup place that got a Michelin star (check my trip report, I think it is on there).\n\nI'll actually post a trip report of Japan later on. I just got back about 2 months ago and I haven't written it out haha",

Think I'd likely need to bring along some nicer clothes with me?\n\nAgreed on Singapore. That said, it really looks like the best gateway to SEA from the US. You can fly direct to Changi from the west coast of the US. Maybe I cut a night from Singapore. I'd still have a full day there, which should be plenty based on research. \n\nWould be great to see your Japan report. I'm concerned that SEA / Japan in one trip may not be compatible.",

The extra clothes in SEA you buy could be tossed away before departing to Japan. I know it's wasteful but only do it if it is weighing you down. Or give it away to anyone. Or bring old clothes to SEA that you are for sure going to throw out at home and throw it away before departing to Japan and buy some cool clothes in Japan to wear and take home lol \n\nYeah, Singapore is a rich people's playground. That is why I really didn't vibe with it. I seemed out of place when I was there. But it was a clean city. \n\nI think you can make it work! I am so hyped for you haha",

It's even great as a day trip from Tokyo. Go to Fujikawaguchiko (about 2 hours from Tokyo) on a clear day. Also, August is like peak typhoon season in Japan so don't be surprised by a bunch of rain and wind. Although if it's windy and sunny then you have a better chance of seeing Fuji. You can even see it from different spots in Tokyo. If you go to Odaiba using the Yurikamome line you can see fuji from the train. Also it's gonna be insanely hot and humid, so make sure to carry a cloth with you to wipe away your sweat. Japan also sells tons of products for the hot weather like electric fans or cooling menthol wipes",

The traffic culture there is just so much different compared to the west and that applys to any means of transport. The fact is, scooters give you freedom, save times and pretty much everyone uses them, tourists and non-tourists alike. \n\nYeah, going through Samui is pretty much required. So when it comes to convenience then yes, staying on Samui can make more sense. That said, in that case I would skip Samui alltogether. Of course, as Samui is your first stop, then perhaps your expectations are not too high at that point. In that case, perhaps Samui won't disappoint you. I prefered Ao Nang/Krabi a lot more - it had more options for tours, had nightlife, beach options and was overall more lively. Other tourists seemed also to prefer Phi Phi, but sadly I didn't visit there so I can't speak about it from experience.\n\nIf you do decide to go to Koh Phangan, then you have to consider that you can only get there by ferry. And ferrys can run late or you could be told that the ferry is too full and wait for the next one. That happened to me and my friend and we were 'lucky' that our flight got delayed, because otherwise we would've probably missed our flight.",

                            "comment": "Kyoto is great for soaking up the culture and tradition, but it can be a bit tame in terms of nightlife and other activities. Osaka on the other hand, is a 24-7 bright lights kind of place, and people there are stereotypically less reserved. Mind, these are generalizations, you can find fun and tradition in both cities anyway, it's just that fun is certainly easier to find in Osaka.\n\n1. Maybe just save Singapore for another trip? It might be easier (and cheaper) to fly to Japan first, then to Thailand, then back to the US again via Japan. Heck, you might even consider this route: US-&gt;Tokyo-&gt;Bangkok/Thailand-&gt;Osaka and Kyoto-&gt;US. \n2. Indeed check Osaka, it's the other major airline hub. \n3. Understood, just seems a waste to spend just a night again in Bangkok (or perhaps I misunderstood, and that's just a quick transfer?).\n\nAnyway, enjoy and take care!",

But I'm pretty set on getting my Dive certificate, and the closest/best value for me is at a resort in Sharm-el-sheik. Does anyone have experience with this location? I've read a ton of horror stories about solo women and the people who work at the hotels; should I just scrap this and find another way to get my certificate?",

I've heard horror stories on dive forums about shoddily run operations and unsafe boats.   Do plenty of research before you pick an op. ScubaBoard has a Red Sea regional forum that you might be able to get good recommendations from. \n\nThat said... if you're just getting your initial open water cert and not doing a divemaster or instructor program that you're trying to do all at once, you can probably get your OW cert locally in a lake or quarry from a local dive shop for cheaper and safer.  Not as beautiful as doing reef dives in a vacation destination, but honestly the experience of doing your training in less perfect conditions will benefit in the long run.  It might be worth it to contact a local shop and inquire there first.",

Cairo is extremely chaotic and overwhelming. I\u2019m used to it after two years but see my family and friends go through it when they visit me. My best advice is to be open and curious. Be open to the culture, be curious about why things are they way they are here. \n\nAvoid Sharm and go to Dahab. Dahab is like your comfortable college town. Restaurants with friendly owners, everyone knows everyone, you can walk around in your bathing suit no issues with men. You\u2019ll still get states but the men there don\u2019t approach and act creepy like they may do in resorts. Sex tourism is a huge market here and I feel that solo women in resorts like Sharm may be mistaken for a paying customer. Dahab is a different vibe. You can do dives there and the reefs are amazing! I like Coral Coast hotel and Acacia. Have fun in Egypt!",

When I read about solo women traveling in Egypt, or almost anywhere, actually, it mostly seems to be younger women asking. Would the advice and cautions be the same/similar for a woman in her upper 60s? Would it matter that I have short, bright purple, hair? (I suppose I could let it grow out, if necessary.)",

EliteEgypt is an American owned tour company that puts together amazing tours with vetted and kind local staff. \n\nSure, be sensible and assertive while you\u2019re here. I quickly learned here to stop being so friendly all the time to strangers. It\u2019s an American trait that isn\u2019t necessary here. I felt like living in the American South for my entire life before moving to Egypt didn\u2019t make that easier. We\u2019re used to small talk and smiling at those around us. In Egypt, that will be seen as a signal that you\u2019re interested in the man. So, just be aware of the cultural norms and you\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ve never been touched here. In my personal experience men do intensely stare and occasionally cat call however they\u2019re babies and will back off and cower if you glare or laugh at them. You can also pull out your phone and take a picture of them and tell them you\u2019ll report them to the police. Egyptian jail sentences are scary \ud83d\ude05",

She\u2019s asking because she probably heard so many stories about egypt and wants to hopefully hear a good story or 2 about a potentially safe place. And voila there is apparently a place called Sharm thats safe. And im glad myself that you guys mentioned it so thanks. I\u2019ll probably check it out when i go",

Everyone is your friend and trying to sell you something but I did not witness any women being blatantly harassed.  I\u2019m sure it happens and a lot, but I didn\u2019t see it.  You might consider flying into tel Aviv and taking the bus down to Taba.  Walk over the border and then head to Sharm. Depends on it you want to spend a day or so in Cairo or avoid.",

Lots of travelers from France and Germany in the summer. I was in Hurghada - I cannot speak for Sharm-el-sheikh specifically, but have heard that it has similar vibes",

One guy at the concierge tried to accuse my father of trying to flee without paying while I was literally with the guy standing next to him settling the room tariffs. I was so goddamn enraged and the scumbag didn't even have the decency to apologize. I would have made a scene but I was so sick of Egypt that I just wanted to get the hell out.",

Yeah it was a lot of attention in cairo but not really much different than other Arab countries. Traffic is a mess. English is decent. I took an overnight bus by myself to the Red Sea and it wasn\u2019t comfortable but it was fine. I think sharm el sheik would be pretty fine as well. Not many Americans, but there were some Germans. Happy to answer other questions if you have them!",

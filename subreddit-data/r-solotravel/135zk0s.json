            "comment": "I would recommend El Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de Guatap\u00e9, and possible Cocora valley if you want to go south.\n\nMy 2 cents here --\n\n- Your schedule is very tight, and transportation in Colombia can be problematic. Especially if you don't speak spanish (I don't)\n- Wear sunscreen. I got a severe sunburn that was no joke. A bandana I put around my neck made a huge difference, afterward, too.\n- Get cash - Cards don't work everywhere and you can get stranded without cash.\n- Avoid Claro sim cards, and only get a sim card at an authorized dealer, NOT the airport. They will need to register your phone to avoid it being blocked.\n- Be observant. Notice that some areas people put backpacks on their chest to decrease risk of theft.\n- Try the colombian soda. Grape (Uva postabon) and their Colombiana were amazing.\n- Ensure you ALWAYS have lots of water with you, and wet wipes or hand sanitizer. At a rest area I went to wash my hands (got soap) and found out they had no running water. It's also hot.\n- Clothes - Nobody had a clothes dryer. Plan around clothes drying if needed.\n- Cartagena - I avoided this place because everyone I spoke to along my way who went here had something stolen or was robbed and I was carrying expensive photo gear. Everyone said it's a great place though, just be cautious and aware.\n\nColombia is a wonderful country, but exercise increased caution and don't flash expensive stuff because you will quickly draw unwanted attention to yourself.",

And I completely get what you\u2019re saying about the tight schedule and also skipping Cartagena. On second glance, I think I\u2019m leaning toward a bit less time in Cartagena. Sorry to dig, but is there any food you had that you would say is can\u2019t miss?",

It\u2019s a great spot.\n\nIf you are planning o me getting a SIM card and can get an esim on your phone I\u2019d suggest trying Airalo (from the App Store), makes things easier to be able to have it set up before you get here.",

            "comment": "I recommend flying between Cartagena and Medellin. The bus will take too long. \n\nCartagena is very touristy, with the most amount of people trying to sell you something. Ignore them and continue on. The walled city and Getsemani is worth to see. It\u2019s very different from Medellin.\n\nI felt safe in both cities as a solo female traveller. Play by the safety tips and you\u2019ll be fine. Follow what the locals are doing (if you see their backpacks in front it\u2019s an area to do that in). Don\u2019t walk around aimlessly looking at your phone and try to take it out in a store if you have to look up directions. \n\nI also recommend taking a day trip to El Penol and Guatape when you are in Medellin. \n\nLa cevicheria in Cartagena \nAlambique in Medelli",

I am from India and I've never travelled internationally before. As of now, I'd just like to cover Bangkok and Chiang Mai (maybe Pai as well). Within 10 days.\n\nMy agenda is to just sightsee, eat food, and visit temples. Looking for a more relaxed trip. Not looking forward to partying and stuff much. \n\nFellow Indian solo travellers (and everyone else as well), what's an ideal budget (tickets, stay, sightseeing, food, a little bit of shopping, scooter etc ) that I'd definitely require for this trip? I will be most likely staying in cheap but decent Airbnbs or hostels (yet to research that bit)\n\nAbsolutely any ideas, recommendations are welcome!",

                    "comment": "First, it really depends which region you're travelling to. Different regions have different currency agreements + popular tourist apps + transportation apps + cheap accommodation apps.\n\n1. Most efficient is usually to use a widely-available international credit card (visa or mastercard) and to pay by card as you go instead of withdrawing cash. Visa and Mastercard are gigantic companies that usually get far better exchange rates than any individual bank or exchange kiosk.\n\n2. TripAdvisor is one tool, but you can also look on Google Maps, Wikivoyage/Wikitravel, or check paid guides like Lonely Planet or Rough Guide. Local tourism websites also have good suggestions for smaller destinations that are not well-covered by major guidebooks.\n\n3. It depends on the size of the city. For a world-class city like Berlin, London, Moscow etc., I'd go 3-5 days depending on my individual interests with 2-3 days for a \"second city\". But if I really like a particular city I can stay far longer.\n\n4. Cheap to maximise my travel time, but I'm also not obsessed with penny-pinching. I tend to only book places with a rating of 7 or better on Booking and/or HostelWorld. I find that the *really* cheap places often cost you in terms of transport (further away from the centre) or comfort (more beds per dorm, or cheaper-quality beds/bedding) and often aren't worth the savings.\n\n5. Depends where and when I'm travelling. If I'm travelling to a popular tourist destination (e.g. Barcelona) during a popular travel period (e.g. summer or winter holidays), I'll book as soon as my plans are settled, usually many weeks in advance. If I'm travelling in a less popular area and/or during an off-period, I'll often book day-of or maybe 1-2 days in advance.\n\n6. Check our [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki).",

I'm a 28-year-old male who has booked a round-trip flight from the US to Amsterdam for its direct schedule and to explore Scandinavia. I have 15 days and plan to stay in hostels (my first time) to challenge myself to meet like-minded people. I haven't booked anything beyond my US to Netherlands flight and want to be flexible with my plans. Even though I'm introverted, I want to push myself out of my comfort zone.\n\n  \nI'll be arriving in about 2 weeks and would love any recommendations for things to see in Amsterdam (I'm already planning to visit Efteling), Stockholm/Oslo, or any other country/destination on the way. I have a pretty open budget, but I'd prefer to save money by staying in hostels and use the extra money to splurge on tours and experiences. In case I feel overwhelmed, I may use points to stay at a budget hotel for a couple of days.\n\n  \nAs a former musician, I love music and may go clubbing one night, but I'll be traveling with a basic wardrobe. I'm planning to travel as light as possible with just a phone and clothes since I'm a minimalist, and it's only a two-week trip. I would appreciate any advice on essential items I should order ASAP like backpacking towels, a phone plan, battery pack, etc. Also, any laundry advice is appreciated so that I can travel with a normal-sized bag and take it with me to museums and other places. Thank you in advance for any advice, recommendations, or personal anecdotes you can share!",

Different for you, of course, because you're visiting a friend but if you do stay in NM more, I have a few recommendations: Santa Fe, Taos, or Ruidoso. Beautiful cities/towns with plenty of nature nearby. Santa Fe is the closest and easiest to get to. Definitely a cool place Check out Meow Wolf if you go there.",

Sucks to hear it has gotten worse.\n\nIs there still a lot of dog shit on the streets?\n\nSorry to hear about your experience with Paris. Did the person who grabbed your bag just let go and walk away like nothing ever happened or did you have to fight them off?\n\nHoping somebody on here can give you advice!

Lol\n\nHere you go!\n\n\"\nIt is possible to renew your passport at almost any time within its validity period. However, it is only recommended to do so more than 9 months to 1 year ahead of its expiry for a legitimate reason.\n\nYou may need to renew your passport for reasons such as the following:\n\nYour passport has been lost or stolen\nThe information on your passport has changed, such as if you change your name after getting married\nIt is nearing its expiration date\"\n\n\nEDIT: the only thing you lose would be the 2 years left on your current passport. So once you get a new one, the clock starts at the time of issue for another 10 years.",

The number of generally unhappy, judgmental or pushy people has not made it a fun experience for me either even though they're a minority. I'm also paying nearly $200 a night for a more 'affordable' hotel. It definitely feels like a normal major city but with really old (admittedly nice-looking) buildings and some British/European quirks and that's it. I tried to keep that in mind but I think I'm bored of paying so much just to look at things that kind of start to look the same over time. Even the renowned museums were pretty similar to those in the USA just with larger collections.  \n\n\nI think to come here, someone really needs to have specific things in mind that they \\*must-see\\* or do.

San Fran Ocean Fire Pit beach is also cool because you can make your own bonfire in the pits. (check if there are any burning restrictions during certain dates)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou might like driving south along the Oregon coast and stop along the small beach/fishing towns along the way.

Crescent city in Norther Cali is also a great place to stop for the night.",

I\u2019m a first time solo traveller (25f) from California that will be visiting Hong Kong (6/3-6/20ish) and Singapore (6/20ish-6/27ish) in the summer. \n\nI really enjoy exploring unique neighborhoods and sight seeing, museums, shopping for cute knick knacks (ceramics, stationary), and eating local, cheap eats (think cha chaan tengs, street vendors). Would also love to know what night life is like in both cities and where the best places are to meet people!  \nCurrently, I'm looking into staying at a hostel in Singapore that\u2019s social but still clean and safe. :) Does anyone have any particular recommendations or will also be visiting the country around the same time?  \nThanks!",

But even so, there are places I'm the world that are just more dangerous than others. Schaan, Lichtenstein is going to be far less dangerous than say Rio De Janeiro, Brazil in terms of crime and something bad happening to you while you're there. That's not saying that something bad *will* happen to you in Rio, it's just a higher risk. \n\nIs it worth it? That's another one that depends. It depends on you. In my experience, it's absolutely worth it. I get something out of solo travel that I do not get out of traveling with a familiar partner. It makes me feel like more of a resilient person, to not have that safety net there in the form of familiarity. I'm forced to exit my shell and comfort zone, which I value highly as it builds confidence and character in myself.",

Quite nervous but I've been wanting to do this trip since 2019, would've gone in 2020 if it wasn't for *The Event*. I picked Malta as the language barrier isn't an issue (English is one of two languages), it's a tiny island so can't really get lost, and relative to its size it has a lot of interesting cultural and recreational activities to get up to. Provided my time in Malta goes as well as I'm hoping, this will open the door to travelling further afield as well as a massive boost to my confidence and self esteem.",

    "postText": "I'll be in traveling solo for my birthday over a weekend in May, and looking for a special, memorable way to spend it. I will be turning 29 in Barcelona and it will be my first time in the city. I love to travel and explore with new cities, but not a big birthday person. (At home I often stay in for my birthday if that is any context, so very low key typically.)\n\nI figured since I am in a new place, it is worth doing something special and perhaps a bit out of the traditional comfort zone. Any ideas for making this special especially when solo and not with family/friends?\n\nIf it's helpful for me specifically, I like bars (beer, wine, gin &amp; tonics), nice restaurants, meeting people, not huge into clubbing but do like live DJs where there's a vibe and love good concerts so could consider that as something different... all in all, up for a bit of an adventure to really do something deliberate as a means of celebrating. Any suggestions from you all? I would also love venues where I could meet others or at least people watch &amp; possibly strike up conversations. Any and all suggestions are welcome for places to go, things to do, or people to hang out with.\n\nThank you so much in advance. Cheers!",

I did a paella and sangria cooking class once and it was an absolute blast (search Airbnb experiences for that). You could also splurge on a photographer to follow you around for a few hours. That way you\u2019ll have nice and professionally taken pictures to remind you of the trip.",

They had dinner and welcome drinks/pregames each night and would take you out to a bar then a club. I made a lot of friends here and had an amazing time. So there\u2019s no doubt you\u2019d have a fun time for your birthday while staying at a fun hostel",

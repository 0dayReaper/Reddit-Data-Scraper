    "postText": "Hi! \nI\u2019m currently in the Philippines and going to Vietnam next. I have 4 weeks in July where i\u2019d like to go to another country to relax but also do some snorkelling for a few days. \n\n I\u2019d like to hear some experience for specific locations and for solo travelers (no private tours). \n\nIdeally somewhere I can get to quiet easily = no secret island where I need to charter a private boat to get there  lol \n\nMy budget would be 30-50$ per day. \nI\u2019d like to find a place where I can move around the country to do some sightseeing and ideally. \n\nI\u2019d love to find a place where I can just go by myself to the beach and snorkel or join a tour (budget max of 50-100$ for the tour). \n\nI\u2019ve heard about Thailand and Indonesia for snorkelling but after doing some researches, places like Thai gold islands or Bali are not great for snorkelling (coral being dead). \n\nThank you",

It is definitely over touristed but the coral was pristine and home to such an amazing array of sea life. I've heard the snorkeling near Raja Ampat is even better but I haven't been myself.",

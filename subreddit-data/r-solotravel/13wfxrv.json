I was wondering how correct that is. I am more curious to hear that particularly from people who travel a lot. My English is pretty bad as you can see. Keep in mind that I have never been abroad yet nor do i have any plans but I was just curious about that.",

            "comment": "English has undeniably become the global standard for a global lingua franca. \n\nHow widely it's known, especially at an advanced level, obviously depends and obviously isn't universal. And the applicability will depend a lot on context and life. \n\nBut in most cases, if the local language isn't English and it's been translated into something other than (one of) the local languages, it will likely be English. Even here where I'm from, with multiple languages (Switzerland) - and where we need to learn one or more of the other local languages while in school, English is increasingly used as the 'bridge' language rather than our school knowledge of the other. You'll often see, when travelling, for example a Japanese tourist talking to a vendor in Jordan will both default to trying to speak English. \n\nThat being said, while for example, most people from Shanghai will know at least some basic English - farmers in rural China likely won't because lingua franca or not, they won't need to know it. Same applies most places - you'll often find the trope that Germans are incredibly good at English (they are) but if you go out to rural Germany, you'll find that proficiency starts to take a stark turn. \n\nAnd with that applicability, sometimes there are also regional bridge languages that are more applicable. In East Africa and Great Lakes Region for example, a lot of people are already using Kiswahili as a regional lingua franca. Going back on examples, some of those farmers in China may actually speak multiple languages, just not English because it's less applicable for them. \n\nBut if you're talking globally and bang for buck globally, especially for travellers or in business etc - English yes, likely is among your best bets.",

When I was in \u0130stanbul, almost all restaurants etc spoke English but when I needed help at a train station the attendant/guard didn't speak English so we used a translation app.\n\nI always memorize a small number of phrases: no (local language) or I don't speak (local language), please, thank you, excuse me, sorry, yes, no, English (and French, which is my second language). Putting in a little effort goes a long way.",

It is widely recognized. \"Known\" is a bit misrepresented as some people recognize English words but do not understand it or at least, find it difficult to fully comprehend unless you talk slower or use your hands/visuals.\n2. What does work regardless of what language you use are pictures and symbols. Japan dented the language barrier by using plenty of universally recognized signs and symbols across the country. This is how non-JP speakers navigate Japan sans translating devices.",

            "comment": "&gt; and that you can get by everywhere with it.\n\nComplete bullshit! Sure, English is an important language and I've a very hard time to see how I would survive without it. That said, admittedly I've not tried everywhere I've been and certainly things have improved over the years but I've been at plenty of places where English was not available.\n\nDepending on the source you want to believe, up to about 1.5 billion people speak English, roughly 1 in 6 or so. That seems like a lot, till you realize that those speakers are very unevenly distributed over the planet. Don't know the exact figures, so take it with a grain of salt. But the very large majority of English speakers live in the few dozen countries where English is an official language, I think the top 4 (US, India, Pakistan, Nigeria) alone count already for over 50% of worldwide English speakers. \n\nFrom the remainder most live in countries with well educated populations where often 50%+ of the population knows some English. From what then remains, most are located in the economic and tourist centers of other countries. \n\nYou may of course be lucky, but in rural China English is of very little use, even in 2nd, 3rd tier cities there is a very good chance your hotel staff won't know English even more so if you have some cheap crappy hotel. The same is true in a lot of Latin America, if you leave the main cities and tourist trail English becomes pretty scarce. Many countries in Africa the same thing.",

In South America, Spanish is the most common language. In most of Central Asia, the common second language is Russian. And in mainland China, good luck getting by without Mandarin. \n\nIn large parts of the world, you may find young people and those who work in tourism who can speak a little English. But the polite thing to do is to at least attempt to learn a few phrases of the local language, and you can use hand gestures, phrasebooks, translation apps, people to interpret, and body language for the rest. I've never been anywhere where I could not communicate at all (though some parts of China came close). There was always a way.",

    "postText": "Hi all, planning my solo trip to Peru after my trip was canned in 2020 due to lockdowns. I am planning to be there in 2024 for around 5 weeks. I know its a bit precarious travelling to Peru right now, I am still planning it anyway in case.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQFhk86yOPdb1o64NvLPtXoRtqwudqF4urBXb8tFX0Q/edit\n\nI am primarily going for some longer hikes as you can see, but will be planning to visit museums, architecture and eat heaps in between those longer treks. Just wanted to see how feasible my current abridged itinerary would be. I am pretty flexible with extending or decreasing my trip a couple days since I will be finishing up a work contract - unsure if I should spend another day in Cusco after my trek?\n\nAlso, am still deciding if I should do the Santa Cruz or Huayhuash trek when I am in Huaraz - both are absolutely stunning, but should probably choose one to do. \n\nI will be going there alone as a 24(F) so would like to know if there is anything I should take into consideration of outside knowing some Spanish for communication.\n\nThanks!!!",

            "comment": "Some ideas:   \n\n\n1) If you want to explore Lima I would leave for the day before your departure from Peru. You would have a buffer time before your flight home in case something happens and you would arrive later than expected. You have several days in Lima, I think it's too much, it's one of the less interesting places in Peru, some people even hate the city.   \n\n\n2) Lima-Ica (Huacachina) is almost 5 hours ride. Is it necessary to go there and back? You might consider something else - going to Nazca to see its lines and then take a comfortable night bus to beautiful Arequipa. Arequipa has also night bus connections to Cusco. This might be a time-efficient way to see a lot and not backtrack.",

The road is bumpy and very sinuous. It\u2019s just not worth it, plus you\u2019re wasting precious time on your trip.",

            "comment": "Hi! I'm from Peru and I've been to all the places that you wanna go to besides Huaraz :( First of all, I came back to Peru almost a month ago. I wasn't here when all the political turmoil happened but the truth is it has gotten way better. You can't see any strikes happening in Lima downtown by now. I hope it continues like that and I really think so since all the protestors gave up. We're definitely in a better situation than December 2022, but who knows.   I honestly think you should be fine if you come in 2024 unless something politically enormous happens like it did last December.\n\nNow, focusing on your trip, as you're interested in museums, architecture, and food, I highly recommend Arequipa instead of Ica. Arequipa has a different gastronomy that isn't that easy to find in Lima. The architecture there is also very impressive and different than Lima. \n\nAbout Lima, it's my hometown and I must confess that there's not much you can do. I don't like it that much and I know that travelers prefer other Peruvian cities over Lima haha. It's better if you do a city tour if you're planning to go to Lima downtown because it's unsafe. I only recommend it since you want to go to museums, but I'm not sure if the city tours usually include it. If it doesn't, you have some other museums in the wealthiest part of Lima (Miraflores, Barranco, Costa Verde). You should be fine in those places and it's nice down there but always keep an eye on your phone and backpack.\n\n  \nHuacachina is gorgeous too and I really like it, but there are a few things to do there if you aren't a party person. The problem with Arequipa is that it's an enormous city and I would suggest staying there for at least 5 days. Also please hop on a flight if you're going there (and Cuzco too). The roads are long and kinda dangerous here.\n\n  \nYou should also spend another day in Cuzco to rest before heading to Huaraz. I didn't go trekking but I know it's very tiring because of the high altitude there. Also, keep in mind that you really need to acclimatize yourself as soon as you arrive in Cuzco. Please take it seriously. Otherwise, it's not gonna be fun at all. That means no drinking, no staying up late, etc. It's hard for some people but it's worth it, I swear. I'm from Lima and I spent the first day in my Airbnb even though I wasn't feeling that bad. Also, Cuzco is very pretty but not as much as Arequipa in my opinion.\n\n  \nAbout Huaraz, I've been told by a friend who is from there that it's as dangerous as Lima so please be careful. I've never been there, unfortunately, but the places that you're going are amazing. It's actually on my bucket list haha.  \nI hope you find it helpful! Safe travels :)",

            "comment": "Unless you're a party girl, huacachina is fun for a good half an hour. It's the tiniest city, and after the dune biggies and the sand boarding, you will be bored. I'll just do a day trip or skip or reallocate those days elsewhere. \n\nTo be honest, I'd just replace that with arequipa it's such a gorgeous city with loads of hiking to do, and it's on the way to Cuzco. Huacachina was fun but not that fun. I have not been to huaraz, so I can not provide any advice on that. \n\nAs a fellow female solo traveler, be prepared for a good share of cat calling, and do not take taxis directly from the street under any circumstances either call them or order them or an Uber via app. There have been any instances of girls being kidnapped. Cuzco is quite turistic, so it's a fairly safe city. If you are planning to do the Inca trails buy the permits fairly in advance as they do sell out pretty quickly.\n\nEdit: if you have the flexibility to extend it, I'd you're missing out on some pretty cool destinations.",

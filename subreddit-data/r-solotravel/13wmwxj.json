    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI\u2019ll be in central and Eastern Europe during July and august, and was contemplating visiting Transnistria and Moldova while I am there. I know that it\u2019s basically a Russian vassal state, but is it safe to visit and relatively easy to get in to? Would being a  US citizen cause any problems? I\u2019ll be using my EU passport anyway to get in but am a bit deterred considering the treatment of some Americans in Russia at the moment. Tiraspol is also quite close to the Ukrainian border which I\u2019m a little sketched about. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you :)",

In much of Ukraine you're still more likely to die in a traffic accident then due war activity. \n\nNothing one does is risk free, but don't see reason to worry unless there are reason to believe you've a specific reason for being at increased risk.",

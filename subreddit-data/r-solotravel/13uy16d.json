    "postText": "So long story short, I was waiting to board my flight from Nashville to Columbus. One of the staff from Southwest asked for 3 volunteers to get on the next available flight since mine was over booked. I volunteered and was given a $800 voucher to use towards any flight! \n\nMy birthday is coming up in October and I decided to take a solo trip somewhere abroad but I\u2019m torn between Hawaii and Costa Rica. I mainly want to see nature and have close encounters with animals. Maybe do some shopping. Possibly skydiving and definitely zip lining. Since I\u2019m doing my trip solo (22 F), safety is also a big determining factor for me. \n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated! I\u2019ve been to Mexico on a cruise solo and recently visited Miami solo but I still consider myself beginner level!",

It\u2019s a small country so you can get practically anywhere in six hours or less. So many shuttles and buses criss-cross the country making travel super easy. \n\nHostels (Selina) are ubiquitous and great places to meet other solo travellers. Made amazing friends that I still keep in touch with today. \n\nMy Spanish sucks, but English is prevalent enough pretty much everywhere. Learn a few key phrases and you\u2019ll manage. \n\nWould recommend it 100000%",

Would you feel comfortable renting a car in a foreign country?\n\nMy personal vote would be Kauai for a first solo travel adventure, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a \u201cwrong\u201d choice per se\n\nHawaii is an \u201ceasier\u201d destination IMO, and Kauai is by far the most remote/least visited Hawaiian island so you don\u2019t run into quite the same level of tourism as the other islands",

            "comment": "I live in Hawaii &amp; it's pretty cool! But please do know the price differences and your preference. Each island is wildly different. Kawaii is way more nature but very expensive. Oahu is not crazy expensive in general but it's the big city. Maui is beautiful &amp; lots to do but expensive. I used to live on the big island and now Maui &amp; the big island in my opinion is the coolest. On Hilo side it's tons of nature, very cheap, and tons of locals. On Kailua Kona side very hot and more for typical tourist stuff. It really depends on your budget. If you want tourist stuff mostly I would say go to Costa Rica because it's cheaper and more culture. If you want to truly experience Hawaiian day to day life and culture go to Hilo. The big island is mostly the least disturbed island when it comes to outside influence, except for Kailua Kona",

I am currently on my second trip to Costa Rica in 2 years (first was solo backpacking and this time with family). Amazing place. Very safe, relatively safe/decent public transportation that goes cross country (just book with reputable sources and try to avoid going at night if possible). Amazing hostels in terms of quality and social environment if you\u2019re looking for it. I would 100% recommend Costa Rica",

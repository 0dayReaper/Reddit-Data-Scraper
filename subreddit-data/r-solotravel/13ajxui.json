    "postText": "Last December I traveled Rajasthan and liked it a lot. I plan to travel Madhya Pradesh this December for 10-12 days starting in Delhi.\n\nI wonder if you can give me some tips on how to make this a great trip. I am mostly interested in historical sites (like big forts), not so much into museums. I also want to see wild life.Ideally, I would not want to move places every day.\n\nHere is as far as I got:\n\nDay 1: travel to Delhi to Agra. See TM. Then travel on to Gwalior.\n\nDay 2: Spend time in Gwalior, afternoon travel from Gwalior to Khajuraho\n\nDay 3: Khajuraho\n\nDay 4: travel to either Bandhavgarh National Park or Kanha National Park\n\nDays 5-6 National Park visits\n\nIs there any point in visiting both Bandhavgarh National Park and Kanha National Park?\n\nRest: definitely Orchha and possibly Varanasi.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny comments or tips?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould you recommend inland flights, private cars or trains? Any tips?",

    "postText": "Heading to Ibiza for about a week. Looking for recommendations on fun things to do/see/eat. I  already know about the major clubs where Guetta/Harris etc perform as well as O beach club for day parties. Any other major pool parties or clubs to see? What about party boats during the day? I believe boat trips to other islands may take too long? Thoughts? Fwiw I\u2019m an American Male with the Spanish of a 6 year old. Can speak/understand enough for it to not be a problem.",

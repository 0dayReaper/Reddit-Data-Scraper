It's the best overview, plus it's a turn-key schedule and plan, with flexibility to zero in on anything that piques your interest. \n\nWhen I travel with friends and family, I like to join one of those \"free\" guided walking tours (though you still should give the tour guide $10-$20 \"tip\"). It's just a bit more incentivizing, because you're paying after receiving the service. \n\nWhen I travel solo, the introvert I am, I prefer my own adventures. I've followed the Frommer's self-guided walking tours in several European cities, namely Antwerp, Prague, Budapest, Barcelona, and Vienna. Frommer's website has provided free access for as long as I can remember. The author's name and publish date isn't posted, but if you do some preliminary research, you can double-check certain places are still open. I haven't found anything particularly glaring.",

For example, I think NYC is just too damn big for it, though the Suggested Itineraries section is a similar alternative, just not as informative in detail.",

While the city guides don't give written walking instructions, what they're great for is you can download a link to the suggested list of places and it syncs to your Google Maps. Creators curate the lists of places, and Google Maps does all the navigation for you.",

    "postText": "Way back, cruises for solo people were a ripoff.  It actually cost MORE for the single person than what it would cost 2 people sharing a cabin.   Something about less gambling and drinks revenue.\n\nThen I started hearing some cruise lines were offering single people rooms and better rates (well, slightly less ripoff rates...) than before.\n\nThen covid hit and that put all the pricing out of whack.  It was cheap for a while, but I heard cruising is very expensive now.\n\nWhat's the current state?",

There is an option for single occupancy pricing and it shows you the single supplement which has been applied.\n\nFrom a quick look, it appears that single supplements get smaller closer to the cruise date, so if you're thinking about a cruise at a non-peak time and your dates are flexible it could be worth booking closer to the time.",

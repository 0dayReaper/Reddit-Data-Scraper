    "postText": "I've been lurking ang posting occasionally here for a while now. Been   \nsolo traveling for almost 10 years now, mostly for the trips that are   \nlonger then one month.\n\nI'm reading some post here about   \npeople who are having some trouble making friends along the way, and   \nalot op people in the comments say they dont't travel to make friends,   \njust want to explore, be on their own.\n\nBut in the end, when I look back, the  \n best and most memorable experiences along the way have been with some   \ngreat people I met along the way and new friendships that have formed.   \nMost will fade away, but some I'm still in touch with.\n\nFor example, once,in 2013, my first   \nsolo trip, and first trip to Asia (India) I met a guy and we ended up   \ntraveling together for a about 4 weeks. We met alot of others along the   \nway that joined for smaller periods of time, in the end we had so many   \ninside jokes and things to share. Till this date it's still one of my   \nmost memorable travel experiences.\n\nI had more like that, but what I'trying to say is that in the end, the best solo travel momories where   \nfrom times that I have met the most wonderfull people and spend some   \ngood times together,\n\nNot from that museum or building I always wanted to see.\n\nWondering how you woud relate to this?   \n\n\nA: I prefer to be along and do my own thing\n\nB: I'm good either way, just roll with it\n\nC: The people I meet along the way can really make the trip, and it's a big part of it",

            "comment": "Neither. It's about a) wanting to take a trip and not being willing or able to wait for someone else's schedule to align with mine, and b) wanting to make my own decisions throughout a trip without having to worry about what someone else wants to do.\n\nIf I meet and socialize with other people during a trip, great! If I don't, that's fine too! But it's irrelevant to my decision about whether or not to take a solo trip.",

I mostly travel alone because most of my friends would not appreciate the kind of trips I like - very heavy on museums and other assorted historical sites (I've always loved history and even started a history degree basically as a hobby when I turned 40). I travel at my own pace, go wherever I want, and I don't depend on anyone when I plan to spend a day in some museum or travel to another city to see something I wanted to see for a long time.\n\nSometimes I do socialize with people (I had a few really great drinking evenings on my travels) but usually I don't actively seek them.",

I love it too, if I didn't have to work in between, I'd spend all day in museums and art galleries, the old town parts, the libraries. If it's possible I try to catch a theatre show or a musical or a cultural event. \n\nMy friends and my sister who I've traveled with before, are more one-and-done a day or two of sightseeing then beach days and lots of shopping which isn't my jam. I mean I also appreciate a beach day but yeah, different strokes. This is why I enjoy the freedom of making my own schedule and activities.",

Very few want to explore, sightsee oddities and breathe in the atmosphere like I do. It's usually just \"walk a bit, restaurant, walk a bit more, caf\u00e9, sit in park, ride home\".\n\nWhen I'm more like \"let's ride the train for 2 hours to an island, hike up its mountain, grab local food, eat it at the peak, find another fun way to get down, spend time with nature, animals and at the sights when it gets emptier, get the very last train back, everything hurts but worth it, then repeat next day\".\n\nAny like-minded people along the way are super welcome. Usually while hiking, at concerts or from free walking tours.",

I know by involving my friends at home, it will be more of partying /drinking, compared to adventurous activities or sightseeing &amp; exploring. \n\nAt the same time, socialising with people I meet is secondary, because everyone you meet may not be accommodative with what you would like to do. I did meet some great people in some trips, with memories for life. But there are many solo trips where I have not met anyone too. That will definitely not stop me from travelling ! \n\n(More excited to answer this post as off to Kashmir (India) in 2 weeks ! )",

However, This is a consistent theme I see here. Everyone thinks you\u2019re supposed to talk to tons of people and have these magical experiences with others, etc. As someone who used to be very insecure and definitely an introvert, I know I\u2019m never gonna meet that expectation. This makes me happy that I can just go to another place and be myself and still enjoy it. Because I do enjoy my own company for sure. \n\nFor me, it\u2019s nice if those connections were to happen spontaneously. When people engage me, I can be pretty charming, but most of the time I don\u2019t engage others cause that\u2019s just me. the thought of forcing it to happen is just against my nature. Solo travel would be an opportunity for me to experience another culture and see some cool sights/eat some good food mostly. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll suddenly change just because I\u2019m traveling. Although I could see how people similar to us might take the opportunity to strike up conversations with people in a new set/setting might renew confidence in approaching others apart from your daily routine.

You are not bound to any plans, can change plans according to your mood. No potential drama. Can travel whenever and wherever you want, do not have to take into consideration others. It is peaceful. \n\nI also have to add that it can take time to get used to it. It can be sometimes awkward going to places alone (like restaurants etc) but you get used to it.  It is not a guarantee but you also meet new people sometimes.\n\nSince I have been doing trips like that, it also helped me manage my work/social life and recharge myself.",

There is nothing like being in a beautiful city, taking it all in, doing as one does but the people honestly can make the trip 10x better or worst. \n\nI had two experiences where I met someone and our entire trip was fun bc we did it together, the vibes were great and I had someone to share the memories of my birthday with. \n\nOn the other hand, I met a sister duo and they fought during the trip, mind you I was solo and people I met joined in and we created a group. They literally ruined the entire day of my trip and things started looking up once I separated myself from them and did my own thing, but it was annoying, having them knock at my hostel door for me when I wanted space. \n\nI also had a friend I met in one city travel with me to another and at that point I found myself wondering what my time would have been like without her there, because I she felt glued to me. \n\nIts a give and give, I love giving myself the opportunity to discover a new city but part of that is discovering the people I meet there too.",

This was 6 years ago and we still email and text every month. \n\nI love the freedom of traveling alone, going my own pace, enjoying the things I want to do but organically meeting and having fun experiences with others is the icing on the cake!",

I felt like it would help me grow and discover myself more. And also definitely nice to do my own thing instead of compromising or doing what the person I travel with wants. It felt like a way to unwind and get closer to myself. But I also hoped to meet people along the way and get some nice connections. So it depends on what you yourself want and who you happen to meet down the road. \n\nPersonally I discovered I like to do things on my own, but being on my own for too long (let's say two/,three days) without having a chat or doing something with someone else is not my style. I find it more fun to also meet people and have a chat or do something together but still being able to do my own thing. If I meet someone I can decide whether or not to join them doing something but I'm not 'obligated' to if I don't feel like it. If I'm traveling with someone else then I have to take their wishes into account (obviously), and I can still say what I want or do what I want as well but I find it harder to do that. For me that's the difference.\n\nBut I like both solo travel and travelling with certain people from my social circle. I do very much enjoy the social contacts.",

I don\u2019t need to meet other travellers , it\u2019s great to do it but that can be a double edged sword, I\u2019ve seen plenty of travellers just hook up with other backpackers and then they\u2019re on the piss in their new bubble and I\u2019d question how much of the country they\u2019re in do they actually see?\n\nI\u2019m perfectly fine with the fleeting friendships I make with the locals\u2026 I have several per day that can last a few minutes when I ask for directions or they can last hours when sitting in a bar or on a bus.\n\nThat said I agree with the Op when he says the fondest memories are of hooking up with another traveler and moving on together for a few days.\n\nEither way it\u2019s all good isn\u2019t it?\u2026 we\u2019re travelling.",

Mostly for experience sake and not really to make friends. I rarely am able to connect with most ppl in general (I only like soul connections) so I don't expect friendships while traveling. Just maybe someone nice to chat with and move around a bit with. I'm good with 1 or 2 day trips with others but I'd rather still be alone cause in general I'm not someone who goes or flows with groups. Like, I'd be against the group idea most of the time. I prioritise my needs since no one else would - so that's just in general more important to me. And also cause I really hate fights but they seem to happen a lot when I'm with most ppl (might be a pattern brought on due to upbringing) but that's also why I don't tend to stay with someone long (while travelling I mean)",

I'm 38F, adopted from India, Swiss. I travel first class and stay at hotels, so a more mature traveller. I also only travel within Europe and by train. \n\nRight now I'm in a train to Germany. I'm visiting my best friends in the Netherlands, in the hospice :-( .\n\nI need a lot of quiet, I like the quiet of hotel rooms, me time, a nice breakfast, walks, museums, tea shops. \n\nI've met lovely people travelling and am happy to meet them for tea, an outing or dinner (like I do my friends at home). That's great but not a must. \n\nApart from my best friend, no one ever visits me for days on end (she stays max. 2 nights and stays in one of my two bedrooms, so each of us can retreat in the evening).\n\nI will go to a concert in Geneva end of June. I'll go with a lovely but exhausting friend. I travel alone back and forth and I booked to single rooms in a luxery accommodation. Well do dinner and the concert, breakfast and a walk together. But I also have alone time before, at night and the evening when she's not there. \n\nI also often take 3 hours to myself when travelling with a group. I often go shopping or to a botanical garden by myself.",

    "postText": "I am 39 years old divorcee living in USA. Since I was in my 20s, I want to travel the world. I put it on hold for so many years because I was in relationship, worked hard to pay debts &amp; bills, and just live as normal as I could even though I know that\u2019s not for me.\n\nMy ex husband &amp; i separated last year, sold the house and we got divorced this year. I used the money from the house (my share) to pay all of my debts &amp; i have some left that I am saving for my trip.\n\nMy apartment decided to charge me extra rent after my lease is up on 8/27/21 so I took a plunge and bought one way ticket to Barcelona, Spain because there\u2019s no way i will stay here another year and paying more instead of living my dream.\n\nI am going to quit my job bc they don\u2019t let people work out of the country. I am going to do housesitting, working at hostels in exchange for accommodation, continue teaching esl online &amp; do jobs along the way along my journey.\n\nIt\u2019s going to not be easy sometimes but i am committed to do it even by the time when i leave i will be 40 years old.\n\nThis subreddit gives me so much ideas &amp; encouragement so thank you all for posting &amp; now for reading my post! See you out there!",

            "comment": "Congrats on taking the leap! A few points: Unless you're an EU / Schengen citizen, consider the following:\n\n* You'll need a return or onward ticket for the airline to allow you to board your one-way flight.\n* You'll need a work visa to authorize you to work along the way. Be *very* careful of anyone who wants to hire you to work under the table, as this is a classic way that backpackers and travellers can get exploited or taken advantage of. \n* You can only stay in Schengen for max 90 days as a tourist.\n\nCheck out our Wiki post about [working abroad](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/workingabroad).\n\nIf you're a certified ESL teacher, there's work to be found teaching English. But it's not that simple in the EU. A friend of mine (Canadian) taught in Spain for a year, and the paperwork to navigate the visa process was cumbersome, and this was pre-COVID. Just something to be aware of.\n\nWishing you lots of luck in your travels! Share some trip reports on here if you like.",

I'm very social so I was always meeting Japanese people and I started picking things up. I worked with bilingual Japanese staff and asked a LOT of questions,  and would overuse new phrases, always getting corrected here and there. After 2 years I was conversational. After 5 I had multiple friend circles who spoke no english, dated girls who spoke no English, and worked in offices without English. I also went to sleep with the TV on, usually on news or variety television. It trained my ears and brain for typical Japanese and really helped. What helped the most was just friends, coworkers, and girlfriends. Well, and being immersed in it day in and day out. Not many people speak English there... \n\nI left after 13 years and hardly use it anymore, but got put on the spot last week on Clubhouse with about 100 Japanese people listening, and apparently my American accent hasn't taken quite a hold almost two years later. \n\nI once left for a year, and upon returning my friends said my Japanese sounded very American. A few months later I was fine.\n\nEdit: typo",

I got an invite from a friend and I did just use some Japanese to English dictionary's opening page to teach me hiragana and katakana. \n\nWhen smartphones came about and Japan got the chat app Line from Korea, communicating with everyone required Japanese, which meant each text from someone was a free Japanese lesson!  Just copy and paste it into a translator and take mental or physical notes. Kanji has thousands of characters and even Japanese people struggle with it. It's actually seen as a bit, I don't know,  \"stylish\" or \"cool\" if you know your kanji as a Japanese person. Hearing this, I stopped focusing on it. But in daily use, texting, work emails, ads, subtitles, I know about 300 or so? You pick them up. \n\nBut I faced backlash from people who studied Japanese. I didn't put years into kanji while in my home country like they did. Then we end up there, and it isn't even needed to know a lot. And since I focus on speaking, my pronunciation is really good. Japanese people often mistake me for Japanese over the phone, and I can pull off three dialects outside of standard Japanese. You don't learn that in college.",

She's not just turning up blind with no plan. She already has a job she can do while traveling (teaching online). I can confirm that this is doable abroad, as I've done the same. She is using help exchange sites to find room and board in exchange for help in hostels/farms, etc. Again, usually a lovely experience and means she can go long periods of time with very little in the way of expenses. Someone on this thread said there was an upper age limit of 26 for workaways, which is madness? I met a German woman in her early 60s who was volunteering alongside me in Scotland.

I stayed with him a couple summers ago and am now in the country on an actual sponsored work visa (a crazy fluke), but living down the road from him. The world is full of wonderful possibilities and kindhearted people if you're willing to take the leap and be flexible! I wish you all the best on your adventures (and hope the Covid situation improves!)!",

They want to make sure you are planning on leaving. It doesn't have to be a return ticket, but having proof of onward travel is a good idea. Arriving in the Schengen Area, it's perfectly acceptable to show a flight from a different city in the Schengen Area for 89 days later. For example, if you land in Amsterdam, and they ask, just show them the RyanAir ticket you have for 2.5 months later from Rome to Istanbul. That suffices as proof of onward travel. FWIW, I've never been asked for this in Europe. It probably helps that I'm a little older (44) than most people who overstay and look for work. The point is to make sure you are prepared to deal with the proof of onward travel question.\n* If, and this is a big \"if,\" you are asked about how you plan to support yourself during your travels, do not mention anything about volunteering at hostels, house sitting or finding work along the way. This could be seen as \"work,\" and could very well result in denied entry, if you don't have the right to work in the country. It's probably best not to mention teaching online either. It could complicate things.\n* Pay close attention to visas and how long you're allowed to stay in a country. Familiarize yourself with the Schengen Area (Schengen is not necessarily EU and EU is not necessarily Schengen; there are some differences). Remember if you're traveling on a US passport,  your stay in the Schengen Area is limited to 90 days out of any 180 day period. That means if you are in for 90, you have to be out for 90. You can't leave for one day and reset it.\n\nSorry if I went into too much detail. I'm not sure how much this will help. \n\nLet me know if you need any recommendations.  Have fun!",

Do some research on the various neighborhoods (they call them Barrios) as they are all unique. Gracia is definitely more local, and has a lot of the young adult population. L\u2019exiempla is the big, grid-like section right in the middle of the city and gives you more of the big-city vibe. El barrio gotic (gothic neighborhood) is super pretty and has the small, European roads that wind and end up in cute courtyards that are oftentimes depicted in places like Italy, France and Spain. \n\nThe whole city is superb walkable, and the metro system is safe and easy to figure out. Make sure to have a bag that can rest in front of you while you walk because pick pockets do exist. The pick pockets are most common in major touristy areas, like Las Ramblas and Paseig de Gracia.\n\nAlso, I would really recommend checking out the bar L\u2019oveja Negra (the black sheep). It has locals and all sorts of international travelers. It is a great place to meet people. There are two locations, and my favorite is the one close to Las Ramblas.\n\nYou are going to have such an amazing time! Enjoy exploring!",

            "comment": "The public transport systems in most European countries are very reliable and comprehensive. They are also for the most part reasonably priced with some forms of tickets that cover multiple use in a certain area for a certain length of time. It's possible to get train tickets that cover much of Europe and permit multiple journeys within a set length of time. I'm not sure if Interrail still exists but that was one.\n\nCoaches (long distance buses often with toilets etc on board) are often very economical, especially when booked in advance. The absolute cheapest are often the late night ones. In mainland Europe and the UK they're a pretty safe way to travel just check not only the times but also the pick up and drop off locations - a really cheap fare is great but if you get dropped off into a new city at 3am at a stop which is by the road in an industrial area and you have no idea how to get away from there that's not always worth the price.\n\nUber exists in a lot of places but bear in mind that in more remote locations and at late hours you may struggle to get a driver. It can be worth googling for a local taxi firm and booking them to meet you off a late night bus or train.\n\nDon't forget ferries. A foot passenger ticket is often reasonably priced and if you can sleep in an airline seat you'll be able to sleep in the seats available on board.\n\nThe best price tickets are usually got if you book early. This applies to coaches, trains and ferries. You don't have to plan exactly but if you do get a combination rail ticket and have to pre book your seats then planning 5 days in and around this city then train on this date to next place and enjoy that area for five days then that train to historic city is booked can be helpful and bring costs down. Italy means if you are able to get any work for bed and board places you can arrange dates and possibly pick ups. \n\nAlso check what tickets are available on the public transport in cities you visit. In my city I can get a one day pass for one bus company at price 1, a one day pass for all bus companies at price 2 or a one day pass for buses, trains and trams at price 3. Or 7 days or a month. And I can get any of those to cover just the city r also the surrounding area. And if you go to tourist cities there are passes which include entry to various museums and atactions and some include bus tickets too. Also don't write off the tourist hop on buses. Yes the price is higher but depending on the place it can work out well to get to outlying attractions and get a guided tour too.",

I currently take online lessons at least twice a week on Italki and my teacher is terrific. It\u2019s not free like Duo but very, very reasonable. I pay $9 for an individual 45 minute lesson. Italki offers three extremely cheap trial lessons as do many of the online language sites. You may have to try a tutor or two to get the right match but when you do they can tailor the lesson to your needs I.e. \u201ctravel Spanish\u201d.  \nI\u2019m not recommending Italki over any other site but that is the site I have experience with. Of course, You Tube is a bounty of language learning information! \nFWIW- SpanishDict.com is a much better translator than Google translate. SpanishDict also has tons of content to help you learn, taped lessons, quizzes, exercises etc. I supplement my live lessons with practice on this site. \n\n\u00a1Buena suerte y disfrutar!",

It's a tappa's bar that is crazy amazing and was one of Anthony Bourdain's favorite places to eat in Barcelona. \n\nI went there a few years ago and it was awesome.  The street graffiti is awesome too if you're into photography. \n\nI did a winery tour that was fun, and they have this bus trip to Angora that turned out to be one of my favorite parts of my trip, just dress warm because the elevation is real. \n\n\nAll in all, have fun!!!",

Some people can just show up to a place and find employment within two hours regardless of papers and the economic realities. These people have rare charisma, excellent people skills, and probably a lengthy history of doing odd jobs around the world. If this isn't you, then you should line work up ahead of time. There are facebook groups for workaway opportunities for many regions and localities. You can typically find farm or hospitality work in exchange for accommodations, but both of these are seasonal, so keep that in mind.",

I was 34 when I left, I bought a one-way ticket to London from Canada (it was by far the cheapest ticket I could find) and went from there. Barcelona was my second stop though! And probably my favorite city. I spent months there, haha.\n\nI spent around 2 years travelling total, with just one break in between. It has probably been the greatest thing I've ever done in my life, no exaggeration!\n\nI was a bit worried about being too old for hostels and a lot of what solo travel is about, but that evaporated quickly.\n\nI will admit that sometimes hostel life gets tiring especially on extended travel, but there are private rooms, or just staying elsewhere nearby and hanging out at the hostels is an option too. If you contribute positively to the place they won't mind, and especially not if you spend some money there eating or drinking or going on tours &amp; pubcrawls. I commented elsewhere here that if you get on well with staff and owners it won't be an issue volunteering for accommodation as well.\n\nThere are plenty of nervous nellies and debbie downers here getting all over you that you that you can't fly on a one way ticket (you can, I've done it constantly), or that you can't possibly volunteer without a proper visa (total crap, even if they somehow found out (how??) you're not getting paid, so they're not that concerned). Also just don't offer that information.\n\nYou may get hassled about one-way tickets but that's often as far as it goes if you say the right things: you're only staying for a couple weeks and moving on, etc. You're a tourist passing through and you know you have x amount of days there, no more no less. Sometimes you have to show you have the funds to support yourself regardless, so have your bank balance readily available.\n\nHowever an easy way to avoid the one way ticket hassle, should you encounter it, is to book a refundable or changeable onward ticket on another airline. They can't check with other airlines to verify anyway. Even fake a ticket if you need to. There's lots of info on travel forums about that. Get a few numbers and dates right and it'll pass.\n\nOne thing I will advise though: don't overstay your visa, not even by 1 day. They're getting serious about that in many places. At best it's a good excuse to fine you and/or fuck with you and make you miss a flight, at worst, they'll ban you from returning. So just watch your stays very carefully.\n\nI have plenty of stories and knowledge about solo travel along with plenty of others here, so be sure to reach out for help if you need it!",

I was having fears deep down that I would never get to travel this way, and that was much worse than the fear of taking the plunge. Also like someone else said, it's not without it's challenges, but it's easier than it seems once you're in it. Most people are just afraid of actually going for it! \n\nSince you've had experience travelling it won't all be foreign to you anyway. Prior to my big solo trips I had not really left our continent, but had travelled most of the western half with family, etc. Oh and also one trip to France for 2 weeks with my ex and parents which was a good primer for being immersed in a totally different place. But of course solo is quite a different thing. I do much prefer going solo!\n\nFor sure message me anytime if you like! Technically I'm not doing this anymore due to covid and all but if things are opening up and you're vaccinated then hopefully it will be fairly smooth sailing. I was lucky I got to go when I did, but things will get back to normal-ish eventually and people are realizing they shouldn't put things like this off anymore. Travel will be booming again before too long I'm sure.",

    "postText": "My questions to my fellow solo travelers are: \n\n* At what point would you consider a hotel over an airbnb?\n* Given my context and my tentative itinerary, would it be more practical to stay at hotels?\n\n# Context\n\n* 33M, freelance writer/editor/I always bring a laptop.\n* I've been using airbnb for solo travels to East Asia, Australia, and Southeast Asia since 2018.\n* Loved the privacy, value for location, and amenities (esp having a washer, so I can travel light)\n* Haven't tried hotels for solo travels unless you count capsule hotels in Japan\n* Currently planning an October West Europe trip starting in Paris for five nights (first time ever). Rest of tentative itinerary [here](https://imgur.com/ZZ1RlVV).\n\nTokyo is one of the most expensive cities in the world, but I think in terms of renting for tour purposes, Paris is easily more expensive if Airbnb prices serve as basis.\n\nAll of my travels have been renting entire apartments/houses, but I find myself considering some private rooms in Paris because that's where most of my preferred price range resides (&lt;$105). \n\nAlso, because while on the cheaper end, I don't know how far the \"20th arr\" or \"15th arr\" are from the popular attractions in terms of accessibility/ticket prices, or if Paris is *small* enough for them not to matter as much, so I gravitate towards renting private rooms within the first 10 arrondissements. \n\n# Enter Hotels\n\nI've been browsing some of the old posts in this sub and in the last five months, it seems a majority of solo travelers have gone back to hotels if traveling within Europe.\n\nBecause of that, I've checked out popular \"value\" hotels in Paris (starting at $120/night). I found good ones via Agoda (which I got directed to by Trivago), especially with free cancellation perks. \n\nWhile the reviews seem awesome in terms of location and hotel-stuff, I also checked out Airbnbs and I found entire apartments being rented out at the same price range (+/-$10). Naturally, they are more spacious, but without the concierge and with some rules that can be hit or miss. \n\nGoing back to the questions, your feedback would be deeply appreciated, especially if you've experienced airbnbs in Paris and decided hotels are better.",

            "comment": "Europe has several chains of good value 2 and 3 star hotels - ibis, Motel One, etc. There are also lots of independent operators which are often very good. These would be well worth checking out - if you shop around, you can get a small but well fitted out room in a well located hotel for a reasonable price. These hotels usually don't have laundry facilities, but there are generally laundromats in touristy areas in Europe.\n\nParis is expensive, and - speaking from personal experience - attempting to cheap out on accommodation there can be a false economy as you'll end up staying somewhere that's either grim or inconveniently located",

People say that the 10th Arrondissement is dangerous but I would just call them racist.\n\nWhen comparing locations and prices of hostels, airbnbs and hotels, hotels are the obvious choice.",

            "comment": "If you're okay with a private room in an apartment as opposed to a whole apartment, AirBnB will be significantly cheaper than budget hotels in Paris, particularly for longer stays. I've done a couple of 3-4 week stints in Paris in addition to some smaller trips, and only once have I opted for a hotel.\n\nAs far as the arrondissements are concerned, the m\u00e9tro is a pretty solid system and I've found it easy to get anywhere in the city using either regular lines or the RER. Of course, you'll want to consider where the things you're trying to see/do are. I've stayed in a few of the outer parts: Ivry-sur-Seine, Pr\u00e9-Saint-Gervais, and Saint-Denis. Ivry and Saint-Denis were pretty well connected, took me about 20-25 mins to get to the city center via m\u00e9tro. Pr\u00e9-Saint-Gervais was the nicest of the bunch, but the nearest m\u00e9tro station was a 15-20 minute walk, which added to the commute time. Saint-Denis has a rough reputation, but I honestly had no issues and would stay there again (I was researching at the Archives nationales at the time, which are just north in Pierrefitte).\n\nYou can find cheaper spots in the inner arrondissements on AirBnB too, but it takes some digging and booking far in advance.",

            "comment": "I can give you my experience as I went to Paris first for 4 days, and then ended up living there for several years at a later time. \n\nParis is big, but not overwhelmingly big. The metro will take you most places. If you wanna go across the city it's no more than a 40 min ride, give or take.\n\nAs for where you should be located, it would be good to know what you're looking to visit/do. The 20th arrondissement can still be fairly \"central\" on the edge with 10th and 11th, or a bit far if you end up on the opposite end. When I initially visited Paris, so those 4 days, I stayed in the 5th. I figured I didn't want to learn the metro system much, so I picked a place that I could just walk off from (also, the metro app was not available back then, which is why I didn't really bother), but now there is one so I would 100% recommend using it, it will cut down on time getting around immensely.\n\nFrom experience, you'd do fine any place 1-2-3-4-5-10-11. The nearest parts (to the center) of 17-18-19-20, too (avoid anything behind Montmartre in the 18th, for safety). These are the livelier parts of the city. \n\nResidential/bourgeois are 6-7-15-16, we used to call them dormitories for the rich. Though YMMV, maybe that type of thing floats your boat. They're slightly closer to the big monuments.\n\nCan't tell you if AirBnb is better than hotels as when I went I stayed in a hostel and when I lived there, well, I lived there. I guess you could end up in a dream place or a shot hole. Up to you to decide whether you need and can justify a certain type of accomodation for a short stay, or can do with a simple hotel room.",

            "comment": "For me it mostly depends on whether or not I plan on eating out more often or cooking at home. For the latter, usually an Airbnb is better. For a few nights, a hotel is often easier. For a couple of weeks or more, I often want a more homelike feel so Airbnb works better. Also depends on my mood. Sometimes I think it's fun to interact with other travelers. Other times I really don't want to deal with people as much. Airbnb for the latter. There are also times I don't want to stay in tourist central, so Airbnb works better for those moments. If I'm going somewhere and will be mostly staying in one specific region, a hotel may work out better.",

    "postText": "Not sure if I have this figured out exactly on which pass or passes is best for me. I fly into Zurich July 2 and will take a train to Interlaken. I will stay in Interlaken 6 days. I plan on hiking and just relaxing in nearby towns, alternating that each day. I plan on hiking Hardergrat, Schynige Platte, and a couple others I haven\u2019t decided on. I plan on visiting Grindelwald,  Gimmelwald, M\u00fcrren, Lauterbrunnen. From what I\u2019ve read I thought I should be getting the Swiss travel pass flex, just for the trip from airport to Interlaken. Then back to airport 6 days later, And the pass I\u2019ll need most is the Oberland pass to get to all those nearby places. Is this correct that I\u2019ll need both passes? Or is 1 of those fine, is there a different pass I should look at? Any help is appreciated.",

Unfortunately he was unable to come and since the tickets were non refundable we decided I should go alone.\n\nI'm only 4 days in my 26 day trip and I'm having a really tough time. I didn't feel like doing most aspects such as camping alone so haven't got that planned and tried to arrange other stuff instead.\n\nI'm just feeling really alone and hate that he's missing out on things. I'm trying to enjoy it for the both of us but can't help feel how it should of been OUR trip. I feel so lonely and like I'm not cut out for traveling solo. \n\nIm already counting down the days until I'm back and it feels like a century away. I shouldn't of come on this trip and I regret it but I can't really go back early. \n\nSince this is a solo travel sub I feel like it's the best place to turn. How do I enjoy this trip solo when I feel like it's supposed to be something I experienced with my partner? Really in a bad place mentally so I'd really appreciate any advice.",

So I decided to do things that I wouldn't have done with my husband, hiked longer/harder, canyoning etc.\n\nI stayed atcampsites as it is socially acceptable to approach other and start chatting. I asked people at caf\u00e9s if I could join them/her if there weren't tables left, I even went to a crowded caf\u00e9 just to talk to people. I often asked why people were on holiday here, or if local what I should see. It's fairly easy to get people talking. My husband was an extrovert extrovert. I'm more shy, but I've learned from him.\n\nI found out that I felt really lonely when I was with a large group of people who knew each other, so I avoided that and walked together with other solotravellers or couples. I have taken hundreds of pictures of people with their mobiles and that got me chatting with them, so I felt less lonely.\n\nI felt lonely in my tent in the evenings in bad weather, but then I listed to audiobooks.\n\nMy son called me each day with a positive mindset, that it was great that I travelled, so I got a lot of energy from him.\n\nI hope that you will find the joy",

My husband had been in Budapest many years ago and he liked it very much, so when someone here recommended it I decided to go there. Somebody else recommended Slovenia, so I went to Ljubljana and Triglav National Park, where I hiked. I will definitely go back and see more of Slovenia! Then I went to Hallstatt to see the worlds oldest saltmines, I'm a geologist and have worked for a chemical distributing company that sold a lot of salt. It was not really interesting. Then I just walked around in Salzburg, I'll not going back there, but I'm glad I went there. Then, on to Liechtenstein, which was one of the fix-points. I've been to Uzbekistan, and those two countries are the only ones that are double-landlocked, i.e., neither they nor their neighbours have a coastline. It was really a great place, good hiking. Then I went to Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland. Great places. Then Bern, now I've seen Einstein's house, beautiful city, and then to Basel, a great place, I'll return.\n\nI slept in tent, a very good choice as people are social, and I got many tips on where to go and what to do.\nI've done things that wouldn't have been possible with my husband, eg. canyoning, and some things that he would have loved to do, eg, going up to Jungfraujoch with a train from Grindelwald. \n\nI'm so ready to go on other solotravels though not for 4 weeks, but only 2-3 weeks.",

Sometimes he\u2019d get one too.  It was fun, we got really into it.  They weren\u2019t all happy-chappys either, some of them were titled \u2019Teddy so miserable &lt;bf name&gt; couldn\u2019t come too, but putting on a brave face\u2019-type.  \n\nActually, my partner &amp; I were from different countries and we lived in a 3rd country, so we often just had to be in/travelling through different countries for a few weeks/months at a time, every year in fact.  And sometimes one of us would stop off somewhere else that the other just couldn\u2019t make it to, so yeh.  \n\nThe thing is, many people on their first solo trip have these feelings particularly in the first days.  Homesick, or anxious in a foreign-language country, or missing their loved-ones.  Sure it can feel empty without yr partner there, but it can also be a massive learning curve to be independent &amp; more mature perhaps, and deal with unexpected curve-balls life throws.  I\u2019d say stick it out for at least half the trip, try find some activities/whatevers to just make the best of it, but if you\u2019re still really just too miserable, then bail.  good luck!",

You are a complete and whole person without him, so try figure out why you don\u2019t feel that way.\n\nSeparate to that, make small to-do lists each day for your trip. I make photography to-do lists for my solo travels, like some days I\u2019ll photograph doorways, next day I\u2019ll photograph graffiti, then flowers or fauna, etc. Doesn\u2019t matter what the time-do list is, it keeps me occupied and gives me a sense of purpose and achievement when im having down time.",

Unfortunately he was unable to come and since the tickets were non refundable we decided I should go alone.\n\nDid you get any kind of travel insurance with a \"cancel for any reason\" policy? \n\nEdit: It's too late to do this, but you should get this in the future to cover your trips if there are any nonrefundable tickets.",

I spent my days making sure I had great photos and interesting experiences to report, and I would write my update so it would appear in their facebook feeds in time for breakfast (I was 9 hours ahead). It was motivating and with the awesome comments and enthusiasm I got in response it really felt like a shared experience. They made my trip much better than it would have been without them. \n\nMaybe you can do the same for your honey and yourself.",

Like aybe reading a book at a park but instead of a park, read a book at the beach or on a mountain or something. And always remember that even though he's not with you, he'd want you to enjoy every moment of that trip. (Was in a similar situation with my girlfriend before and she wanted me to enjoy the trip I had to take alone). \n\nThat's just my two cents. Enjoy and hoping you'll be alright",

            "comment": "Hey, it'll be OK.\n\nI'm not sure if this helps but I am on a month long solo trip without my husband. I think it works for us because we have different things we are focusing on. He absolutely loves his job (which is why he didn't join) and is focusing on painting (which he hates to do when I am around the house). I am happily taking advantage of my alone time while travelling to work on learning a language and reading. Hobbies outside 'just travelling' can help distract.\n\nYes, I miss him, and yes, sometimes I feel really anxious doing things on my own. But I find it valuable to be on my own for this relatively short while, especially when my husband and I are attached at the hip every other month out of the year!\n\nI'd say give yourself a day or so more. Do something peaceful you've been looking forward to (a nice hike?). If you haven't found anything valuable or pleasant about your experience, you tried your darndest and it's OK to just go home! Good luck!",

Instead of the trip being an unfortunate choice because of it being non-refundable, turn it into - you have a month to get something done.  Or you have a month to discover something about yourself, or you have a month to work on something, etc.  Take a goal or topic you've been meaning to learn more about - and work it into your travel somehow.   Or set some goals - \"by the end of the trip I will \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\".   \n\nFor example - I want to learn sign language/ASL - so I could download some videos or get a book and then go sit in a park and practice with a bottle of wine.\n\nIf you're always looking at it as something you're having to do because you didn't want to lose the money, then you won't ever have a good time.  Gotta force your brain to adjust and look at it another way.  You might surprise yourself with how much you enjoyed it :)",

            "comment": "I remember my first trip I was supposed to go on with my partner. But just before we were supposed to leave (was an anniversary trip i\u2019d booked for us), she told me she\u2019d been cheating for 3 months and was going on a different trip with the other guy. \n\nI still went. Alone. \n\nIt was a hard trip for sure, but it was backpacking in Italy. I was miserable the whole time but it was backpacking in Italy. I had an almost impossible time getting out of bed, doing cool things. But what I did was focus on one aspect of the trip- in this case the history (i\u2019m a historian) and put my heart and soul into it. \n\nMy advice would be it doesn\u2019t have to be a \u2018full\u2019 trip. You don\u2019t have to do everything you\u2019d planned with them. You don\u2019t have to do everything/anything someone would expect you\u2019d do on the trip. Pick up a plant identification/bird book and just hyperfocus on finding cool naturey things and identifying them and taking pics. Try funky foods or learn how to cook on the trail. \n\nFind something to dive into to distract yourself. \n\nAnd just something else- I know its hard- but when you get back, it\u2019ll be like you never left. Day-to-day life will set in again. I know from experience, it\u2019s better to distract yourself as much as possible from the allure of home while you can. The trip can only be a series of positive and negative memories BUT don\u2019t let it be melancholy sad neutral \u2018just missing him/home\u2019. Get what you can out of it even if it\u2019s walking for an hour, enjoying a pretty view, and thinking about the future. Once you\u2019re already out there, your time is yours, but it\u2019s best to enjoy what you can however you want without focusing on what could\u2019ve been. Trust me.",

Age ranges from 18 - 42. even with the language barrier, it was great. I spent part of the trip at a fancier hotel, and that portion felt lonely. Maybe planning a group excursion will help - like a walking tour on AirBnB experiences, or a group day hike.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, I will travel Europe this September in 9 countries and 17 cities. The countries are (Austria) (Prague) (Slovakia)(Germany)(Netherlands)(Belgium)(Luxembourg)(France)(Spain) \n\nI organised my Itinerary and I'll use 18 train routes. I'll not prebook trains but I'll buy most of the time last train tickets so I'll have a more flexible journey.  After my check my cost will be approximately 1600\u20ac to 2000\u20ac .\n  I'll mainly use Trainline app as it has fantastic UI and also finds you cheap tickets with seat reservations as well. \n\nAnd now the question is if I need to buy a Eurail pass instead of pay this amount and buy last time tickets from online apps or ticket machines.?\n\nMy biggest concern is that with online apps I always know if there are tickets available in the day of the journey or even the next days and I can also book seat reservations but can I know this information with Eurail pass and have the same options? \n\nI'm worried if i buy Eurail pass and sometimes they will not be any seats on the train and then lose my train? I'm just no sure yet how the pass works and if  is reliable. Thanks.",

But the only limited eurrail specific trains are I believe Eurostar and thayls trains. You can download the rail pass app to play with routes and see which ones require reservations for all passengers ( TGV for instance ).",

It's kinda extra work though but it's 1000\u20ac less than the Trainline app.",

Set language from Deutsch to English in the top right corner. Pick your journey and select 'Seat only (no ticket)'.\n\nYou can then either use an account (this is probably helpful, saves hassle and is something you can prepare in advance) or book as guest. \n\nFor each journey, the expected demand is listed: for example \"High demand expected.\" Even so, it's still possible to reserve a seat for that high demand train. The same journey on less popular times only have medium demand listed. \n\n(So... I bookmarked all the apps and sites I could find, because I wasn't convinced there is One Single App to Bind Them with the best prices and the most up to date info. It's a hassle, but it gives you so much more flexibility.)",

They had no seats left in the allotted alternative train options even though the trains had plenty of seats left. I ended up having to buy a totally new ticket from the operator because Eurail simply didn\u2019t have access to any additional even though the train was a quarter full. Also, there was no phone support for problems, just an email, which was no help in timely situations.\n\nI would absolutely book direct with the trains versus Eurail for peace of mind - even if those cost was a little more.",

For example, I've recently booked a stay in Slovenia traveling from Munich (Oktoberfest, baby!) and the OMIO app wanted to charge me 34 Euro for the 6 hr 15min ride using DB (main trainline in Germany).\n\nI then went directly to the DB Navigator app (official [bahn.com](https://bahn.com) app) to buy the exact same ticket for 28 Euro.",

I calculated my 1 month pass price +seat reservations and I save  1000\u20ac maybe more and if you add the flexibility is a game changer. Although you need to download the app and work on it also go in website and check the section book reservations there you can book seats for every routes even the ones that they are bot visible in the app. You need to play and check the app and the website before you travel so you can know all the info about it and then it feels so smooth.\nBig tip always have trainline available they have the best UI and also best prices I check the prices there and then on DB and the prices were the same and even if it's 5\u20ac more it's worth it it has every detail there and with so must clarity.  If you have these  apps is the best way to do it.!",

    "postText": "Anyone else find New Zealand in winter to be kind of cold and slow and different to what expected? Auckland is the only place that has a city type feel and yet there are so many people homeless I feel so sorry for them and yet it also doesn\u2019t feel that safe. Kind of like a zombie lane post apocalypse. Also the people in hostels are not as friendly and it\u2019s kind of miserable and a cold place/ atmosphere\u2026.\n\nI traveled around to the South Island too and the towns are so small it feels like being back in high school closed off from the real world and very very slow.\n\nAm I doing New Zealand wrong? My work holiday in summer in Australia was warm friendly and great experience. Especially in Sydney where as a gay man I found a community and felt welcome :)\n\nI feel like people are trying to get out of New Zealand\u2026",

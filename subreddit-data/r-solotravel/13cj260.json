Dont book any flights or hotels in advance except the first one. Then go from place to place as you see fit.

Firstly you literally don't have cars nor modern streets in all of the city, you just have narrow streets made for walking like during the renaissance. This is because unlike any other city Venice is built on the water and the main axes of the city are not boulevards or large streets but canals. On the other hand, its architecture is really unique because it bears influences from both bizantine and italian buildings, you don't find this particular mixture in the other italian cities. \nIn conclusion, I understand what you come for when you say it's a tourist trap, but this city lives on tourism since at least three centuries. Mass tourism is annoying but this should not prevent you from enjoying these features that make Venice unique.",

Do day trips from Amsterdam as well.\n\nAlso, go to only one Greek island (instead of four) and stay in the same hotel/apartment for a week. Use that as a stop to relax a bit for a couple of days.\n\nAlso cut out Iceland. For Iceland alone you need more than a week, I would even suggest 2 weeks. If you are from the US, that is an easy destination to fly to from the US as well.\n\nCut out Egypt as well\u2026 \n\nUse all these days for the other places you are visiting, or destinations which are on the way. Check a map for planning your itinerary, because this one here is too much jumping around. There are places between Barcelona and Nice you could visit for example.\n\nEdit: also, what would you do in case a flight is cancelled or there is a railway industrial action (strike)? Your entire itinerary would collapse.",

I'd advise you to focus on just a handful of countries (only Italy, or Spain &amp; Portugal, or the Balkans etc), but if that's not your cup of tea, then here's my pieces of advice:\r\n\n* While you're using London as your entry/exit point, you could think of looking at a few more places in the UK. The Scottish Highland are quite pretty, as is the city of Edinburgh. Oxford, Bath, Cambridge, and Brighton are nice day trips from London. The Jurassic Coast is very impressive as well.\r\n* San Sebastian to Barcelona is a 6-7 hour train ride, usually with a change at Madrid. You could use that handicap to see a little more of Iberia - Lisbon and Andalusia are highlights.\r\n* Barcelona to Nice can be done by train instead of flying. \r\n* Nice to Interlaken will need you to travel either via Lyon and Geneva, or via Milan. Both of them are longish train rides, so a stop en route may be worthwhile. \r\n* Sorrento-Positano is practically the same region and you're giving it 5 nights in all? I'd swap Sorrento with Naples, and give Positano only 2 nights. It's pretty but its also crowded during peak season and exceedingly expensive. A great alternative is the Cinque Terre which has a similar cliff-sea-village setting but a lot less tour groups. \r\n* Ios is a bit skippable, given that you're visiting Mykonos, Santorini, and Milos. Please also expect absolute tourist chaos on Santorini. \r\n* 2 nights in Ljubljana is too little. Add atleast 2 more so you can see Lake Bled and a cave. I'd have added Piran too, but you're already doing the Croatian coast. \r\n* Why not fly to Iceland from Copenhagen itself, instead of backtracking to London via Amsterdam? If you want to visit Amsterdam, you can do it in the very beginning of your trip - the Eurostar runs from London to Amsterdam.",

Then it's work work work to pay off your student loans....then more work to get a promotion....now more work to get a house...save save save.....etc etc\"\n\nAnd before you know it...u have a mortgage, car payments, dating life, maybe a kid etc tieing up your funds and your time.\n\nWe were never taught how to value our freedom; only to devalue it. \n\nYou know what's up!\n\nCheers!",

You will still have heaps of experiences, probably more even when not spending so much time at airports or train stations :)",

Cut 25-50% of the destinations and evenly divide up that time to other cities.\n\nYou have three trips going on at once: western Europe, central Europe, and southern Europe. Pick one - I know you wanna see it all, so do I, but Europe isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. Choose one region, maybe venture into another for at most a week, but don\u2019t over-do it. Sounds like you have the most interest in western Europe, so maybe focus on France, BENELUX countries, Spain, and Switzerland, throw in a week in either Germany or Italy.\n\nIf you wanna get the trip down to 60 days, spend 8-14 days in every country (depending on how much you want to see in each place). Since it\u2019s such a long trip, you want to lengthen the time you spend everywhere so you don\u2019t get burned out by constantly moving around. That means pick 2-3 cities in each country and stick with them. Doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do day trips! But you\u2019re gonna get two weeks into your trip and realize it was a severe mistake to structure it like that",

You actually aren't short-changing any individual location too much - a few cities could use an extra night here and there - but the issue is that you are moving fast and covering soul-crushing distances. \n\n[Here is an optimized 55 days from London to Copenhagen](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=london$3$r~brussels$1~bruges$2~antwerp$0$e~amsterdam$3$r~paris$3$r~saint-jean-de-luz$2~san%20sebastian$2$r~pamplona$0$e~zaragoza$1~barcelona$3$r~avignon$2~nice$2$r~vernazza$3~pisa$0$e~rome$3$r~naples$0$e~sorrento$3$r~florence$2~venice$2$r~bolzano$2~salzburg$2~vienna$3$r~prague$3$r~berlin$3$r~hamburg$1~odense$1~copenhagen$3$r&amp;trans=Train&amp;nights=55&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;) with almost everything you have planned and some fill-ins along the way to give you an idea of what is possible. Zero flights, and only around 1.3 hours of travel/day. \n\nThe cuts are Budapest, Krakow, Slovenia and Croatia.  You could use the remaining time to do Greece, Egypt and Iceland. One tip on Greece: fly directly into or out of Santorini to eliminate one of the long ferries to/from Athens.",

You can always pick up where you left off in the future. Europe should still be around for another 100 years.\n\nI would suggest reading other ppl's 90 day european backpacking trips. Great insight in those! And some post up their itineraries with notes!\n\nUse tripsnek.com to optimize your trip. You input all the cities you want to hit up including how many nights you want to stay. It gives you a score...the higher the better! It's fun to play around with.\n\nGood luck!\n\nThis would be a really cool 30th bday milestone trip!\n\nEDIT: also, please keep in mind that we're just here to help you while you read these comments.

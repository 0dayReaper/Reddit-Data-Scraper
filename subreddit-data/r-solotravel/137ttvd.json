    "postText": "I am planning to visit Portugal with a friend early June and then continue on solo to Spain where I plan on using hostels for the first time. This will also be my first time solo traveling. What I want to know is which cities can I be spontaneous with my travel with? I've seen that Barcelona and Madrid should be booked in advance, but what about Seville and Granada? I'm planning on being in Spain from June 12th through the end of the month (I know my timing is close to peak season...)\n\nGeneral advice and recommendations (lodgings, attractions, food, beaches, etc.) are also welcome. Thanks in advance!\n\nEdit: I can read Spanish relatively well and can speak passably but I am used to Mexican accents",

The Alhambra was nice but I didn\u2019t really feel like there was a lot to do in Granada in general for me.\n\nI thought Seville was pretty easy without booking anything in advance but I would still recommend booking any attractions in advance as the lines can get long. I really loved the royal alcazar and spent almost a whole day there.",

If it\u2019s whiting your budget and liking.\n\nIt gives you an opportunity to get an overall sense of the city and mayor attractions.\nThey have them in most mayor cities in Spain, the 1:30 hrs tour explain points of interest in several languages. grab your map get out of the bus and just walk to the areas of your interest. It saves you time or trying to figure out \nPlaces. \n\n\u201cFar home Atocha \u201c in Madrid lodging has a great location or try to find something around that location. Near Atocha railway station.\n\nSeville ..find lodging something around \nSetas de Sevilla\u2026 great location.\n\nBarcelona \u2026around Gothic quarter. Sagrada familia book in advance,if you like to go inside.\n\nYeah ! for Alhambra in Granada you need tickets months in advance.\n\nHappy travels!",

            "comment": "Early June is already high season for tourism in Spain, crowded in Balearic and Canary Islands,  also south coastal regions such as Malaga or Alicante that are not that big in terms of infrastructure and increase their populations in summer. Cities like Valencia might require a bit booked in advance. Seville and Granada, at least book the attractions in advance. As for Madrid and Barcelona, book in advance.\n\nAs a general rule, north of Spain will be less crowded (exception is maybe Camino de Santiago, some cities in that itinerary will need to be booked in advance). Countryside can be improvised easily except peak season in August/December.\n\nSpain host more than 70 million tourist annually so if something is fully booked there's probably a solution or alternative, there's a very big industry and offer. Being spontaneus is probably related to having a bigger budget to be open to more options on the go, not a problem in itself in Spain, but a bit more expensive. If on a budget, plan in advance for places to sleep. Transport prices also are cheaper and you can find better offers with ticket. Timetables between places are reliable.\n\nAlso, for food i'll advice to not book anything in advance or use phone reservations, just show up to the place or catch in on the fly. If they are at more than say 80% capacity, you might be better served looking for the next place",

For some places its actually too hot for spainiards like seville or madrid in the summer. Locals go to the beach, so you have mostly foreigners fighting for the hotels.\n\nComing from within europe i never had problems in Spain or Portugal booking like 1-3 days in advance. I never know where i am and where i will end up. It depends on your style of travel and how flexible you are. Obviously if you know exactly your plan, book in advance and you get cheaper deals, but you are committed to your plan.",

And June is peak season with American travelers that basically will stay in all the cities you will be in.\n\nIf you don't care where you sleep, you can wait-but be advised you will probably pay more and take more time looking for a room. \n\nAny attractions book now-Sagrada Familia, Alhambra, etc. You will thank me when you can waltz in and see the long lines of people trying to get tickets for the day.",

    "postText": "Im 24M and never been on a holiday longer than 10 days, and never solo travelled or \u201ctravelled\u201d the only holidays I\u2019ve had are with family. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking of travelling for months and I 100% want to do it, I just finished uni so will be travelling, roughly mid July to mid august. I will be seeing family for a week and going to the Paderborn (Germany) festival late July. But what to do with the rest of my time. \n\nMy start location is either Cardiff airport or Bristol airport, I could go to any UK airport depending on the advice but from my research those two are best for me. I was thinking of the following locations but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s too much for the first time solo travelling, seems fine to me but I\u2019m a noob. \n\nDublin Venice , Nuremberg, Dortmund Gda\u0144sk\n\nI\u2019m also wondering if there are websites or apps that will pick the best route to take for these destinations, or do I wing it. \n\nAnd with baggage, I was going to take a personal rucksack but have come to the idea that it\u2019s too small, so going to take a 30L + personal rucksack, so should I try and find trains rather than flights? \n\nFinally, any tips \ud83d\ude02\n\nEDIT: I missed a few things here \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02\n\nI don\u2019t have a massive budget for this trip but the week with family will help save a lot. I have about \u00a3900-\u00a31200, \n\nI want to visit some traditionally \u201ctourist\u201d spots, such as old buildings, museums, churches. And I also want to visit the beaches if there are any and short hikes for the  views. I\u2019m going to stay in hostels, for the hope of meeting people and the price. \n\nHope the extra info helps.",

Blew two tires on a country road and had every other car stop to ask if I was ok and if I needed help. You could easily do a week in Ireland. \nVisited Clonmacnoise Monastery on a whim and it ended up being one of my favorite stops. Peaceful, gorgeous, cool little museum.\nNot sure how realistic that budget is, though. I\u2019m going for 3 weeks and spend around $3000, and that\u2019s with budget accommodations and deal hunting. \nI used WanderLog for planning my stops and itinerary, but found blogs and \u201chidden gems\u201d searches on instagram very helpful!",

If you\u2019re going to Italy, maybe 1 day Venice, then take the train down to Florence or Rome and spend more time there. \n\nIf you plan to visit Nuremburg, I would stay in the south and visit Munich instead of Dortmund.\nI\u2019m from Dortmund and as a local, I don\u2019t understand why people would come here except for soccer. But if you\u2019re in Paderborn anyway for a festival, a visit wouldn\u2019t hurt. Would rather recommend going to Cologne if you want to visit another city in Western Germany. But would skip this overall and move east to Berlin and then Gdansk instead.",

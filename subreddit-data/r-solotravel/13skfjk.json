    "postText": "I\u2019m a female solo traveller in my mid-late 20s and really hope to include Ecuador, particularly the Ecuadorian Amazon, in my Central-South America tour at the end of this year. \n\nI would be there for the nature, not cities and would simply skip any big city sightseeing (just using cities like Quito as a jumping off point to mountain/forest towns if that helps in terms of safety). Should I give up that dream based on safety? If not, what could I do to stay safe? Other than paying close attention to my belongings, I would avoid Guayaquil (and the region around it), avoid taking night busses, be in my room before dark, inform myself about each city\u2019s neighbourhoods\u2019 safety. Not sure what else I could do. I\u2019m at a point where don\u2019t want to NOT go just because no one is joining me, but I also don\u2019t want to be the victim of an armed robbery. Being alone, being short, and looking naive/young (I am not) all make me seem like an easy target. I\u2019ve read about solo people being robbed at knifepoint in touristic areas of Quito, so it seems uncontrollable. \n\nWhat could I do? Any female solo travellers who have travelled in Ecuador? Is it mostly Quito that is dangerous and other areas (Cuenca, Banos, Cotopaxi, Mindo, Amazon etc) are safer? What was your experience? \n\nThank you for your input",

            "comment": "I'm not female, but I've been to Ecuador, so I'll add 2c...\n\nQuito has some not safe areas, and a bunch of very safe areas.  Nearly everything that a tourist would care about is in the safe parts of the city.  And during the day, the odds of being a victim of a violent, targeted crime is pretty low.  If you don't intend to spend much time there, then its pretty unlikely that you're going to wander into an unsafe neighborhood just for the fun of it.\n\nBanos is very safe overall.  Its a small city (really more of a large town) that exists mostly due to the tourist economy. The last thing they want is for tourists to be targeted/harmed, so its in their interest to keep it safe.\n\nI had zero issues with crime during my time in the country.  It sounds like you understand the risks, and are being rational, so I wouldn't expect any significant issues.\n\nIf you do go, please come back here and post a trip report so that other female travelers have a point of reference.",

Visited Ecuador at the end of last year and went to Cuenca, Ba\u00f1os, the Quilotoa Loop and the amazon in the Cuyabeno resort.\n\nCuenca and Ba\u00f1os both felt like incredibly safe cities, safer than the cities I've visited at home in the UK even. If you avoid night buses you should be perfectly fine taking public transport. It should be noted that if you are not getting off at the last stop on a bus route, they will drop you off at the highway going past a city. There you will have to either get a local bus or a taxi. This is where it's useful to take a bus with someone you know going to the same place, chances are that on the backpacker trail you will meet plenty of people on the same route as you. You should also note that uber is available in many regions of Ecuador, and is safer than taxis. Make sure you have a local sim with data and you should have no worries about getting around, just stay alert and try to make smart choices and you'll be okay.\n\nI visited Nicky's Eco Lodge in the Cuyabeno reserve of the amazon. They offer a tourist bus for I think it was $60 return from Quito. This bus takes 12 hours, is very safe and only boarded by tourists going to lodge's in the Cuyabeno reserve. I went for four days and honestly could not recommend the experience more!\n\nIt is easy to get bogged down about everything that can go wrong as a solo female traveller. However, if you keep your wits about you it is unlikely that you will end up in a situation where you will be harmed in any way. Frankly you just have to be more difficult to target than someone else. If you keep a hand on your bum bag for example, a pickpocketer is more likely to target someone else who is not actively aware of their belongings. Worst worst worst case scenario, you get mugged, it is unlikely, but it happens. If you give them whatever you have and they will let you go. If you throw your bum bag in one direction and run in the other - they will go for your bag. Ensure you have backup travel cards in your acommodation and copies of you passport etc and you will still be okay. Do not keep too much cash on any one card and if you are able, have some USD notes in your main bag that will stay in your hostel/hotel locker. USD are accepted everywhere in Latin America and it's useful to have some notes as emergency currency.\n\nIf it is any consolation, I have been travelling for nearly 9 months solo in Latin America, and have never been mugged, or been in a situation where I was scared being mugged. I have met several people who have been mugged - and every single one of them was a man. I think women have a sixth sense for danger than a lot of men don't have. When they tell me what happened, I know I would have never have ended up in the same situation. This is not me victim blaming here, but simply pointing out that taking suitable precautions WORKS. As long as you have taken suitable precautions, which it sounds like you are prepared to do so, do not let fear of the worst case scenario cause you to not enjoy your trip. I honestly believe you will be perfectly safe. In all honesty, I have felt more unsafe in many cities of the UK than I ever have in Latin America.",

                            "comment": "One dressed up as spiderman at halloween. Went out with people they only met that day and couldn't rely on. Got incredibly drunk. When the bar closed he decided to go to a local bar in what was obviously a dodgy part of town with no tourists and have more shots. He then got into a street taxi that on reflection could have been a random car and not even a taxi. Ended up robbed at gunpoint. Once the driver had all of his belongings, my friend asked him if he could drop him off at his hostel at least, which the robber did.\n\nSo many guys decide to walk back to their hostel alone in the the evening instead of getting an uber. Uber is so cheap in Latin America, so I don't really understand this.\n\nAlso tinder scams, whilst not insanely common do happen. I have never met a women get targeted on tinder.\n\nAlso just little things like, this dodgy looking street will save ten minutes walking. Men are more likely to seriously consider the shortcut.\n\nI honestly think that it is naturally more dangerous to be a woman just about anywhere in the world, and as a result we are raised to be more aware of our surroundings and be more cautious in our day to day life, taking fewer risks. Obviously this a generalisation. This does not mean that women never get mugged and men always do. More so that from my personal experience, guys tend to end up in risky and dangerous situations more often than women. When you just have to be a more difficult target than others, making decisions to avoid risky situations leaves you statistically less likely to be targeted over others who take riskier decisions.",

            "comment": "I just returned from Ecuador today, travelling solo as a blonde tall female early-30s - just adding for reference, I tend to stick out immediately in many places in LA.\n\nI second exactly what has already been said. Personally, I did not like Quito and felt uncomfortable - took taxis also during the day and went on a trip outside the city the next day instead. Cotopaxi was absolutely fine (stayed at the secret garden, all in a group and with Transport anyway), so was Ba\u00f1os and Cuenca. \n\nDon\u2019t save on taxis, e.g. around Ba\u00f1os it was about USD 2. If you stay in hostels, you will definitely meet people you can join for dinners etc., so no walking alone. During the day, I had no concerns. My hostel advised to take a passport copy and their business card which I found sensible.\n\nI took night busses (just along the tourist route!) and for me, it was fine, also other (female) tourists who (accidentally, I don\u2019t know) were all seated together. And yeah, Guayaquil - most uncomfortable part of my trip turned out to be the last: having to take a taxi from the bus terminal to the airport.\n\nCard/cash wise: I carried no cards as many places didn\u2019t accept them anyway and just took USD 20-30 plus maybe a note hidden e.g. in my sock, just in case. Oh and with my banking apps I was able to block/unblock cards in an instant so I did this whenever I needed cash/could pay by card. I added an eSIM from MobiMatter to my phone for data and it worked perfectly. Definitely recommend having data.",

It\u2019s an amazing and beautiful country from the sights to the people. but for safety, you do have to be more alert than say you normally would be soloing a place like Europe imo. The touristy areas that you would probably go to are all pretty safe during the day, especially in cities such as Banos and Cuecana as those are cities pretty much built on tourism. I personally would generally avoid being out too much at night because it can get pretty sketch even in places such as Banos, but honestly, I\u2019ve felt more safe in banos and Cuenca than I have at cities at home (U.S). At the end of the day its like all other travel. Be well prepared and informed, don\u2019t be stupid, and always listen to your gut. If you feel like something is off always listen and get yourself out of the situation if possible. If you do end up deciding to go to banos, alone or with others, and are looking for a social/more leaning of party hostel I would def recommend \u201cGreat Hostels\u201d it\u2019ll probably be the first result on hostel world for banos and is an overall great, clean, and secure hostel with lots of cool backpackers and especially the staff. Shout out to Sebastian and Rena.\n\nShould mention that I had no problem with crime during my time in Ecuador, but Quito def was pretty sketch/uncomfortable at times. I would recommend try to be with other backpackers as much as possible. While during the day, crime will most likely 99.99% not be an issue (unless you re being stupid). It still adds another layer of security and comfort",

I haven't made it to Ecuador yet but I thought it worth mentioning that the reports I'm getting from other travelers about Ecuador, specifically both Quito and Guayaquil have not been good.  Almost everyone has said they felt less safe there than anywhere in Colombia or Peru.  Both cities are apparently in much worse position safety wise than they have been for a while, so any personal experience advice you get that's more than six months old might be out of date.  Guayaquil especially right now is an avoid unless you can't (ie flight or bus transfer).  Again I haven't personally made it there yet so maybe I'm way off, but this has been the consensus from just about everyone I've met in the last month who's come through Ecuador.",

    "postText": "As a 32 year old I'm well aware life doing party/social hostels as a way to make a social life abroad (without sticking out like a sore thumb) is approaching the twilight period. I'd say this fact has hit home on my recent stop as on the social bar crawl the next oldest was 25.\n\nHowever to solo travel I will need a social life of some form, so for people who have got to the point I feel I will come to in the not so distant future, what did you do in terms of making a social life abroad once you grew out of the hostel life?",

I still stay in hostels occasionally, but I\u2019ve also been known to book tours with a hostel while staying at a hotel so I can get the \u2018social\u2019 while still having my \u2018grown-up\u2019 space. I do the walking tour thing and have found myself going for drinks/dinner with people Ive met. Have also done some higher-end bar crawls via Airbnb experiences and direct with providers. Usually cost a bit more than hostel bar crawls so (often) attract an older, non-backpacker crowd, don\u2019t give out free shots and go to higher end bars which are more my vibe. Otherwise, I just pitch up at a bar, sit AT the bar, chat to the staff and often end up either creating or joining a group that way. Really depends on where you are - some places are easy, others seemingly IMPOSSIBLE / and your personal confidence and comfort levels. I\u2019m female btw, if that even matters. Good luck!",

I\u2019ve been only to one hostel in Thailand where I saw a sign that said they accept only people from the age group 18-35. But other than that\u2026 in Central America I stayed in hostels where some people were very well in their 50s.\n\nYou don\u2019t even have to stay at a party hostel, most of them have an open door policy so you can always just come to their bar in the evening and meet people there. \n\nBy the way if at 32 you think you\u2019re too old to hang out with these who are 25 then I think you should work on your insecurities. 32 is young!",

I\u2019m 19 and currently solo travelling for the first time, and most of the friends I\u2019ve made while travelling are in their 30s, because I tend to go to places which don\u2019t attract a super young teenage party crowd, and I\u2019ve loved it. One of the best times I had was hanging out with a 75 year old! I haven\u2019t even met anyone my age in the last 2 weeks.\n\nI feel like western society now has a dumb stigma of hanging around with only people your age, when in reality most societies to ever exist all depended on having friendships between different ages - it\u2019s how we learn from each other, and it\u2019s such a rewarding thing.",

Granted, I'm a bit older than OP at 37, but I don't like going to social/party hostels simply because I don't like to party anymore.  I partied A LOT when I was younger, and these days I just like to feel good in the morning, have a really active day, and a quiet night that supports my introversion.\n\n I don't think I'm too old to hang out with 25 year olds, I have several friends in their mid to late twenties at home, but I don't have as much in common with this group as a whole anymore.  Often we connect best with those that are at similar stages of life/dealing with similar life situations, and it's just not there for me in the just-out-of-college on their big backpacking trip before starting real life crowd.  Just another perspective why someone like OP might be looking for alternatives.",

I have stayed there for a couple of months all together over 5 visits.

Jaipur is known for gemstones and jewelry and many of the guests are sellers and designers.  That place has a good restaurant on site and peaceful grounds.\n\nThere are seasonal price variations of course, but all of these fell within the $20 to $30 per night range when I visited.",

However, I made it the center of my life for a decade. \n\nMy advice to you is that hostels are still okay if you're selective. Many of the ones explicitly catering to \"digital nomads\" (usually fancier) will bias toward people in their late 20's early 30's. I've never really had anybody get weird about it after I hit your age and above (I'm late-30s now). Or rather, maybe it was just weird initially, but when we hung out for an hour or whatever they realized that they liked me all the same (this is only for the early-20's people who think if you're over 30, you're dead). I would mostly get my own room, though, as while it's not as social as dorms, a lot of the \"weirdness\" people seem to have is that there's an \"old person\" in the dorm, not the hostel.\n\nYou did not state your gender, but if you're a guy, the one thing I will strongly recommend is to be aloof with younger women until you've established yourself as a considerate person who's only interested in being social (I assume you are). I've seen the older creep in the hostel one too many times and it is obviously a terrible look.",

Some people were shocked that I was in my 40s (I do look like I'm in my 30s).

You don't have to party or even drink to socialize.  It helps, but not required.  \n\nIt's more the mindset, willingness to go with the flow, and not be awkward or self-conscious about your age.  Just let interactions happen organically and just ask fellow travelers questions about themselves.... people love talking about their travel plans and themselves in general.",

Great tip on the smaller spaces aspect. I can imagine no supervision in a big shared space would be horrendous.",

But even in my 20s my travelling wasn\u2019t like that so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s changed. \n\nI also do urban sketching and there are chapters in cities around the world, so sometimes I\u2019ll look up their Facebook page and ask if anyone is keen to meet up. Depending on the city you can meet up with people your age. Certainly in Australia a lot of people in those groups are retirees. But in Asia the groups are full of younger men. So I guess if you\u2019re looking specifically for someone your age, it isn\u2019t guaranteed.",

I ended up going alone and met some cool people on the tour as there was a variety of people different ages on the tour, most older than me and seemed in their 30s. I did not expect to meet people but it ended up being cool anyways and we stay in touch on social media! One of them was a solo traveller and we likely would have met up again if I was not traveling with a group and on a time crunch.",

I find smaller hostels are likely to attract more people in their 30s, or at the very least more mature 20-somethings. \n\nYou can also use Couchsurfing to attend meet-ups or meet people (though it can be frustrating at times as some people use it as a hook-up app nowadays), or you can do Airbnb Experiences or any other kind of tours that often attract solo travelers in their 30s",

Just be a cool, normal person like I\u2019m sure you were before and you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nIf you would feel more comfortable finding the 25+ crowd, i find that the farther off the \u201cbeaten path\u201d i go, the older and less rowdy-college-kid-type vibe it is. You can also stay in hostels that aren\u2019t explicitly party hostels. Staying in Wet and Wild Super Party Pool Hostel  in Mallorca is going to end up being lots of 19 year olds on their first trip to Spain getting hammered. Chill Cool Guy Backpacker Hostel in Albania is going to be a lot more 25+ people. \n\nDefinitely an overgeneralization but after 16 countries it\u2019s definitely a trend.",

I find out, that he is like me, and even been 3-4 weeks in my country, we were immediately friends and ended up hanging out quite a lot and even travelled together. \n\nAnother time, I just ask for direction in Nairobi, Kenya, and the guy I ask end up becoming a super good and fun friend for me during my time there. \n\nA third time, I meet a lovely and so caring girl outside of a mall in Tanzania, and she ends up caring for me while I am sick, and we ends up spending quite some time as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yea, talk with people on your daily go go and friends will come quite easy, especially in \"warmer\" countries like Kenya, Mexico and TZ... \n\nOtherwise a brilliant idea, which I am yet to try, book a private room in a hostel, that seems like a winner solution as well. g them in the day time, unless you meet a Dane in a hostel, which is unlikely to happen, or if you reach out at r/Denmark. \n\nOtherwise a brilliant idea, which I am yet to try, book a private room in a hostel, that seem like a winner solution as well.",

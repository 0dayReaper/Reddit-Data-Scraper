    "postText": "Hello, I'm traveling for the first time, solo, to Europe from  September 22nd-October 2nd. I'm following an artist I love on tour, and will be staying for 5 days in Germany and 5 days in Paris. I can't stay in a hostel due to medical reasons, so I'm looking at Airbnb's. I'll be going to Columbiahalle on a Monday night to see the band perform, and I'd like to go to at least one nightclub, as I've never been to one. I've also been recommended a few sights to see by friends who have been to Berlin. I'm really just planning on wandering around a bit, no strict itinerary.\n\n\n\n\nI've booked my Airbnb in Paris, for $385 for 5 nights. My budget for hotels in total is $1k in total, but staying below that is always preferable. I plan on cooking as many of my own meals as I can because of dietary restrictions. That leaves me with about $600 left in my hotel budget for Berlin.\n\n\n\n\nI'm choosing between an apartment in Potsdam or an apartment in Berlin. There's about a $300 difference ($425 vs $715). Is it worth it to stay in Berlin and not have to travel back and forth every day? I'm especially worried about getting back late at night. I'd be going about $100 over budget for the Berlin apartment, but it's doable if it means I won't get lost or stuck with no way to get back to Potsdam at night. Thoughts? Thank you!",

S-Bahn normally runs quite often, some regional trains also, and busses, Potsdam is included in the wider range (C Bereich) of Berlin public transport. On the weekend they go all night, weekdays from midnight to 4 or so you have to rely on night busses (that goes for all of Berlin).",

            "comment": "Depends on where the airBNB is located in Berlin.  If it's close to the Columbiahalle and neighborhoods like Kreuzberg and Neuk\u00f6ln, I think the extra money is worth it.  It would mean that you can get around mostly by foot, can really soak in the vibe, and won't be tempted to make expensive late night taxi decisions.\n\nIf you need to take one or several trains home within Berlin, then Potsdam wouldn't be too much more trouble.  It'll just be comparatively boring.",

I always say if I had to move to Berlin, Potsdam is where I'd live. I just need to win the lottery.",

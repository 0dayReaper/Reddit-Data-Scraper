So if its beautiful beaches, food, culture, affordability, history, activities, recreation, comfort, service, escape.... it sounds like Thailand has you covered. The most important thing is to be smart and safe. Don't become a statistic out of bad judgement one fine day or night. \n\n I can speak to the benefits of getting away from a breakup or divorce as well as death and family destruction. I have done it short term once and long term another.  It was a good way to feel good and remember why life has a lot more to offer, as well as avoid dwelling on the sads. It helps avoid regret and relapse, and gets you through the rough spots. You can still work out your feelings of the relationship while enjoying Thailand, just you are doing it with a healthy distance from reminders and a big dose of joy. Kind of like an external pain killer. It also helps disrupt the social threads that make ending a relationship more difficult. When you surgically remove yourself, all those connections have to change suddenly rather than slowly.",

I found Koh Phangnan a bit boring, but I was there outside of a Full Moon Party, so there wasn't an awful lot going on. Annoyingly my 20 days in Thailand were almost exactly in between 2 Full moons.  \nDon't forget to negotiate! One of the people I met was epic at it and he managed to get us discounts on trips, shows and at markets.  \n\nIf you are ever hankering for regular unhealthy food, head to a 7-11 and grab a Cheese and Ham Toastie.

It is however a good place to bump into some fellow travellers.  Make sure you are staying in hostels (but check them out first on Hostelworld) personally I can recommend NapPark, you\u2019ll meet people there, and that is hugely valuable if you have never travelled before. Make your journey from there and good luck ",

            "comment": "Hell yeah bro. When you get sick of the Kok hit up go12.asia and take an overnight bus to Chiang Mai. Beautiful city, slower, cooler stuff.\n\nWhen you're in the Kok fly out of DMK. Don't take taxis there just hop on the A1 at Sukhumvit. It's 30THB and works great. The best hostel I have ever stayed in is there at Sukhumvit called Bed To Bangkok, the staff is fantastic, the local night market there is second to none, and it's right next to Chatuchak (biggest weekend market in Thailand.) Lots of awesome shit to see there.\n\n- 13\u00b044'12.1\"N 100\u00b029'45.5\"E https://goo.gl/maps/PhDtAnuSY8G2 there is an absolutely amazing pond with hundreds of turtles, for 100THB you can feed them melon slices and it's fantastic. Nobody knows about this it's not even on Google maps.\n\n- Wat Arun Ratchawararam https://maps.app.goo.gl/82pi7 is the big main one, don't get nekkid there some tourists got tracked down and sued for taking naked pics there.\n\n- 103 \u2013 Bed and Brews https://maps.app.goo.gl/63pPU is a great spot for an expensive microbrew 300ish THB but it's without all the bullshit of a bar and a fast wifi. Dunno how the beds are because I never stayed there.\n\n- Anong Noodle Restaurant https://maps.app.goo.gl/9zog3 is the best noodle house in the Kok. 12THB per bowl and it's fuckin mad delish. Right by victory monument.\n\n- Refill Now https://maps.app.goo.gl/nu5gx Is a great spot if you need something out near BKK. It's cheap, good neighborhood, theres food nearby, and the beds/ac are good.\n\nIf you need some recommendations for Chiang Mai I stayed there for like 3 weeks this past year so I know the city pretty well.\n\nIn Thailand you barter for everything, but sometimes it's better to pay a higher price for better stuff (train compartment, private rooms, better bed, control over the AC, etc) Also hard negotiations burns bridges. Download the app Grab, you can use it like Uber and it's cheaper than a taxi and you won't have to try to communicate your destination. You can also use it for Uber eats but where's the fun in that? Try everything once. If you don't know what to get Pork Khao Moo is always fantastic. Don't fight the heat, go out in the morning and afternoon. M150s are great and only 10THB for a caffeine kick. If you don't know what to do in a city stay in a hostel for a few days and make friends at the free breakfast. DO NOT CHECK YOUR BAGS, mobile is good.\n\nIDK that's all I got right now. I'm at the tail end of my last Asia trip for a while and it's always the best money I ever spend to come out here. Asia is a whole new amazing world filled with the best food you'll ever have, the most beautiful sights, and the happiest people you'll ever meet.\n\nHappy trails. :)\ud83e\udd19\n\nEDIT: IDK if you are American or not but I'm just gonna assume you are. We get 45 days visa on arrival, they may or may not ask to see that you have departure tickets bought already. If you don't have any return tickets booked tell them that you are planning to cross over into Laos or Malaysia by train/bus and you should be fine, works for me most times. Laos is a bit complicated by land to enter, so I'd read up on that. As an American it's pretty easy, $45 in USD or $50ish in THB and a free page in your passport. Malaysia I've never done but I hear it's easier, also I think Americans get into Myanmar pretty easy too. Vietnam you need to do a lot of planning to get into, mailing your passport out and getting an entry visa before you even book. Don't be an idiot like me and just expect to get in places without looking up visa requirements. \ud83d\ude13 But anyway, enter back into Thailand via land and you're good. I think you can only do that a certain number of times now, but I'm not really sure. Most time I've ever spent in Thailand was like 60 days.",

Not to say there isn't anything else worthwhile there, but if you're traveling to clear your mind after a breakup and experience another culture, a beach town catering to western expats might not be the spot for them. In my opinion, there are also far more beautiful beach towns, too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKhao San and Rombutri are backpacker ghettos. The Thais do a great job of corralling tourists into little areas that they can go wild in without disturbing the rest of the populace. Again, if you're trying to avoid sex tourism and general debauchery, these are the streets where you're most likely to get asked if you want to go to a ping pong show or \"special massage\" (that a traveler is likely to stay on). It's, unsurprisingly, where you're more likely to see fights and theft. On top of that, everything is overpriced, the food is limited in selection and quality, the accommodation is terrible compared to other places in the city, there's nothing of cultural value, and you've flown across the world to predominately be around other people from your own background.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe full moon parties are another beast entirely. Not only are they run by the mafia and decimate the environment on the islands, but they are increasingly the sites of rape, murder, druggings, theft, and violence. I get the appeal of a huge, wild party, but the big full moon parties are doing real harm to the environment, local communities, and unknowing travelers. Participating in those events is perpetuating those damages. [Here](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59jqea/shrooms-raves-and-murder-how-thailands-full-moon-parties-turned-violent) is one pretty decent article that covers some of these issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've heard so many people over the years tell me they thought Thailand was \"too touristy\" or that Bangkok was all shitty backpackers and sex shows, and they didn't have the experience they wanted because they went to the few spots everyone hears about. But those places are the smallest slivers of the country and city. It's incredibly easy to have a great experience where you actually connect with the local culture - and not just one set up to cater to tourism - if you choose to stay away from them.",

It\u2019s loud and rowdy and there\u2019s stuff to walk around and look at and drink late into the night. Soi Cowboy is a red light district but it\u2019s a very short block of clubs and bars with neon signs. The surrounding area in the alley has little pop up bars and food. On the other side is the BTS and the best (imo) overall mall called terminal 21. That\u2019s in sukhumvit if you\u2019re looking for easy access and a variety of stuff to do. Khao san will also be fine if you wanna drink and party. ",

I don't know what your age and interests are, but I try to stay out of that area and when friends and family visit, I suggest they stay elsewhere. You can always stay somewhere else and then take a walk around the area one night to see what it's like. I understand that it looks convenient, but you can actually meet lots of people elsewhere, eat much better food, stay in better accommodation, drink less expensively, and experience far better night life.",

It's a lot of fun in evenings with the bars and local food stalls. Don't avoid places simply because. Meet fellow travellers and isit soi cowboy. Whole point of being single and travelling is to be untethered and go where you heart takes you!",

Going there supports that. Maybe ask your heart to direct you to places where people aren't entertaining your company because they were bought and sold against their will.",

Before I booked, I talked to at least half a dozen friends about Thailand. All of them immediately mentioned ladyboy hookers. No matter what pictures you take and what stories you bring back, a lot of people are going to assume you went there for sex.\n\nThat's a big reason why I would up going to Vietnam instead. Same natural beauty but way less baggage. I'd do Thailand traveling with a woman or as a part of an extended trip of the area, but flying there direct is highly suspicious.",

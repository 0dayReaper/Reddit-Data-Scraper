    "postText": "Hello, I'll be in the Philippines for 18 days (including the day I arrive and the day I leave). A part of my schedule is already set:\n\n- Days 1-2: Manila\n\n- Days 2-7: Puerto Princesa\n\n- Days 7-8: El Nido\n\n- Days 8-9: Puerto Princesa\n\n- Days 9-15: ???\n\n- Days 15-18: Manila\n\nThis definitely isn't ideal but I have to stick to it due to prior commitments. I'll see if I can at least have one full day in El Nido (so going days 6-8 instead), but for now this is my schedule. I'm also thinking of cutting down my Manila stay during the end of my trip by one day.\n\nWhere would you guys suggest I go for days 9-15? I'm looking for more nature-centric places (beach, mountains with nice views, island hopping, etc) where I can take a light hike, do some laidback activities, and have good food. I'm not looking to party and I can't swim.\n\nI was thinking of Coron since it's also in Palawan and it has beaches, mountains, etc, but do you guys have any suggestions for what might be better? Should I only stay in one place for days 9-15 or can I split that time between two places?\n\nedit: Just want to say again, I CANNOT change anything outside of days 9-15 due to prior engagements. I'm looking for recommendations for days 9-15.",

The town of El Nido is a unpleasant place really (poorly developed tourist jump off point) and the value is the day trips to the islands. And PP isn't really much of a place either. Do you really have to spend so long in PP?  Consider some time in Port Barton. Look at adding Bohol and Alona Beach. Easy to get to and has some of the things you are looking for. Assuming you are going in the next month or two, it is typhoon season so keep an eye on the weather. I would spend as little time in Manila as possible. Good luck.",

Very small town, you might not have cellphone reception there, and maybe no water or electricity at certain hours. But it's definitely a place to stop and relax for a few days, do some island hoping and go swimming with turtles. Was definitely a highlight during my trip.",

There should be direct flights.  \n\nCebu island itself has a bunch of stuff to do, and Bohol is around an hour's boat ride away.  Bohol especially would be my recommendation - it's got a lot of great nature stuff and fantastic beaches.  \n\nOutside of that you could also go up to North Luzon to the mountains, but that's more time done travelling.  \n\nWould 100% recommend cutting a day from Manila at the end, too.  Manila's not as bad a city as people say, and it's my home, but for tourists there's nothing really all that special tbh.",

I\u2019d still recommend the Tao Philippines expedition. If not that, then maybe go somewhere else like Bohol or Siargao?",

I didn\u2019t go the Bohol but I reckon it would be a good place for you from what I\u2019ve heard of it.\nI did:\nFlew into Cebu and taxi straight to Moalboal\nDay 1-4 Moaboal\n- Kasawan falls cayoneering, I think you would be able to do this even if you don\u2019t swim as you wear a life jacket. This was good but a lot of people there.\n- Sardine run\nFlew to Puerto Princessa and taxi\u2019d to Port Barton\nDay 4-7 Port Barton\n- Island hopping\nDidn\u2019t do too much here as I\u2019d hurt myself so couldn\u2019t really walk unfortunately but I saw there was a hike you can do here. Very quiet place from what I saw, the cockerels were loud though \ud83d\ude05\nTaxi to El Nido\nDays 7-11 El Nido\n- Island hopping\nUnfortunately I got sick here (not to do with food etc) and couldn\u2019t do anything for a few days only on the last day, which sucked. I also accidentally then got onto the wrong boat for island hopping so didn\u2019t even do the tour I wanted \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0fit was still a great tour though.\n- food markets\nDays 11-14\n3d2n boat trip staying on islands from El Nido to Coron\nCoron says 14-18\n- Island hopping\n- I relaxed here for a few days just as it was my last stop\nFlew from Coron to Cebu and stayed the night there before my flight\n\n\nAll the boat tours had life jackets so I think you\u2019d be able to do them and get into the water with a life jacket if you wanted to. When I was done swimming I just sat on the front of the boat in the sun looking at the views. Also some have the kayaks if you like that kind of thing.\nCoron was better for snorkeling than E Nido. The beaches are amazing in all the areas I went, Moalboal was the worst.\nI got taxis as I didn\u2019t want to waste time on long buses ( also get travel sick) and I booked them all before I left, so I guess I may have paid more but oh well. I was planning on getting one bus but my flight time got changed which meant I would\u2019ve missed the last one.",

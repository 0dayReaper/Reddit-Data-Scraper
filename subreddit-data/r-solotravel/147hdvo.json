    "postText": "Hello fellow travelers and remote workers!  \nI'm currently based in a European city and have been fortunate enough to have the flexibility of working remotely while traveling. I use a home-exchange platform to save on rent. I've found that the trips I enjoy the most are the ones where my friends can join me. However that's not always possible, and I'd love some advice from this community on how to make the most of solo trips as well.  \nI would greatly appreciate your insights and suggestions on the following two aspects:  \n1. Meeting similar people: I often work from my accommodation, or from coworking spaces like WeWork, and I find it challenging to identify other solo travelers or remote workers who would be interested in hanging out after work. Have you found specific communities, coworking spaces, or online platforms that have facilitated connections with like-minded individuals?   \n2. Balancing work and city exploration: I often struggle to strike a balance between work responsibilities and fully experiencing the cities I visit. On weekdays after work, I typically have limited energy and end up only exploring local restaurants or taking leisurely walks. I reserve the weekends for more touristy activities. However, I feel like I might not be maximizing my trips. How do you effectively manage your time to ensure productivity while still immersing yourself in the destinations you visit? Any tips or techniques for establishing a routine that allows for both work and play? I'd also love to hear about how you find and plan hidden gems, local attractions, or cultural experiences that shouldn't be missed, even with limited time in a city.  \nVery grateful for any advice, strategies, or personal stories you can share :)   \nSafe travels!",

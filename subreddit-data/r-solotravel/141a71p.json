    "postText": "Hey all, hopefully doing this trip soon. Let me know if this could be adjusted. I am frugal, so given the current expensive \u00a350 a night hostel dorm prices, I won't also be paying for food tours or wine tasting, but I love history, churches, food/wine, natural beauty but also human art to a lesser extent.\n\nI want this trip to be an equal blend of natural beauty and history. I was thinking of going to Cinque Terra for the natural beauty however I may save this for another time perhaps with a partner.\n\nDay 1: Fly into Pisa from UK in morning. See leaning tower etc. Get train to florence in evening. Sleep florence\n\nDay 2/3: Florence\n\nDay 4: Head to San Gimignano(??? looks nice) Stay over here\n\nDay 5: Morning in San Gimignano then back to Pisa for flight home in the evening.\n\nShould I go to Cinque Terra or somewhere more coastal instead of San Gimigano? Also any suggestions for meeting other backpackers with similar interests, or any nature activities/hikes that are cheap and accessible.\n\nThank you in advance",

Should I go for a longer time instead? Hostels right now are \u00a350 a night which is really off putting, hence why I wanted to keep it short!",

Gimignano in the morning and after lunch move to Siena (way bigger and also beautiful too) and stay there for the night.\nCinque terre are beautiful and well connected with trains but it will be a very long day, you should stay one night over there to enjoy them better.\n\nEnjoy your trip!!!",

I'll be leaving for Europe around mid-Feb 2024.\n\n I'm looking for feedback on the general pace of my itineraries, the time spent in each city, and the route - some places I'm seeing friends so the locations (but not timings) are set in stone, but otherwise I'm open to changes. My main goals for the trip are to walk around, eat good food, go to museums, and hopefully do some day trip hikes.\n\nPORTUGAL\n\nDay 1-7 Lisbon (incl. day trips to Sintra and Cascais)\n\nDay 8-10 Coimbra\n\nDay 11-13 Porto\n\nSPAIN\n\nDay 14-16 Bilbao\n\nDay 17-22 Madrid (seeing a friend)\n\nDay 23-24 Valencia\n\nDay 25-30 Barcelona\n\nFRANCE\n\nDay 31-32 Montpellier (seeing a friend)\n\nDay 33-35 Nice\n\nITALY\n\nDay 36-42 Rome\n\nDay 43-45 Florence\n\nDay 46 Crema\n\nFRANCE\n\nDay 47-48 Strasbourg (seeing a friend)\n\nSWITZERLAND\n\nDay 49-51 Z\u00fcrich (seeing a friend)\n\nHUNGARY\n\nDay 52-57 Budapest\n\nCZECHIA\n\nDay 58-63 Prague\n\nGERMANY\n\nDay 64-70 Berlin\n\nDay 71-73 Hamburg\n\nTHE NETHERLANDS\n\nDay 74-80 Amsterdam\n\nFRANCE\n\nDay 81-83 Rouen\n\nDay 84-89 Paris + leave for London\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It could probably be filled with the museums but it will likely be cold and rainy. \n\nI would take off 2-3 days and use them for rest days in between your trip (not in very expensive Amsterdam). Long term travel is tiring.",

                            "comment": "Ah yes that is a completely different trip than I had imagined. And a much better plan in my opinion. Honestly I wouldn't do Amsterdam for cycling. It'll take a while to get out of the city, and especially around the touristy areas and central station it is not an easy place to cycle as it gets hectic. \n\nThere are lots of options around the Netherlands. I have cycled quite a bit, but not everywhere. I think the Province Drenthe has the nicest cycling, lovely countryside and national parks, but that may be a pain to get to as are several other cycling areas. I think Utrecht or Nijmegen may be better options. Smaller cities but still all the amenities. Utrecht is quite like Amsterdam architecturally, and has canals. Cycling around there is nice. Nijmegen is one of the oldest (Roman) cities, I think it has great cycling as the landscape is very varied, you will get fields, fens, forest, a river, and even some of what the Dutch consider hills (very limited). \n\nWherever you go, there is a knooppuntennetwerk (connecting points network) for cycling. It allows you to easily plan a fun route that doesn't just keep you to the main roads. There are maps at each knooppunt and small signs with numbers leading you to the next one.",

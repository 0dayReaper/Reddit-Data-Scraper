    "postText": "Hey guys! I have a week off in October and I'm a big fan of traveling by train. I'm located in Portugal and possibly looking into a classical trip in Central Europe or perhaps exploring a country I really like, such as the the UK with a British Rail ticket.\n\nAdditionally, there are specific scenic journeys, like the Glacier Express or the Royal Scotsman.\n\nIn my home country, I would recommend Linha do Douro, where you can go on a scenic train trip between Porto and Pinh\u00e3o, where you will cross the Douro valley in a 160 km trip.\n\nWhat are some cool train trips that you're looking into or have done in the past?",

I started in Geneva and took trains to Lugano and Trieste, took a busses to zagreb and then to split and flew back to Switzerland. It was really fun and I\u2019d honestly do it again\n\nIf you wanna do a loop, Italy is great for that. Start in the north like in Torino or Milan, take fast trains to Rome and then Naples and then regional trains through Calabria and Apuglia and then head back north up the east part of Italy.\n\nSwitzerland has the most beautiful train routes but the ticket prices without a resident half fare card are a scam, and when I was living there they seemed to be constantly getting more and more crowded. In October it might be better but I was in Switzerland all winter and the high season didn\u2019t really seem to stop on the Inter City and tourist trains\n\nI have a question since you\u2019re Portuguese \u2014 are there any trains that connect to spain? I\u2019ve been looking into train routes from Lisbon to Madrid and I\u2019m finding some online anecdotes about a night train but I can\u2019t find any official information about it anywhere",

So, for now, there are only two trains that connect both countries: Porto &lt;\u2014&gt; Vigo (two trains a day in each direction, no night trains) and Entroncamento &lt;\u2014&gt; Badajoz (same; this one probably works better to reach Madrid)",

I\u2019ve really enjoyed it, good to just travel by train ALOT(average 6 hours each city) and it\u2019s all covered by the new 50\u20ac monthly Deutschland ticket.

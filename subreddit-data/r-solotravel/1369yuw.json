    "postText": "* A lot of hostels don't let you stay for more than a week or two at a time and even then while hostels tend to be reasonably priced on a short term basis, when you look at that over long-term it isn't practical.\n\n* As well, I will be teleworking and hostel type situations aren't usually good for that being that they're typically composed for a bunkbed dorm hall that you're really only in to sleep and a community area.\n\n* I'll probably stay in Barcelona/Lisbon for a month each. What sort of places can I look into for lodging? A friend recommended \"apartment hotels\" but that along with AirBnbs are even more.\n\n* Example: I stayed in Lisbon, in what's now Selina Secret Garden a few years ago before it was owned by Selina and that was perfect because it was $400 for a month geared towards longer term stays and I had my own small private room where I could telework - that place would now be $6,000 for a month due to its new hostel-style per day pricing model.",

Although a little expensive at $300 a month for the one that includes all the European cities.  And I've heard of IWG which is apparently supposed to be a European version of WeWork but I can't find out info on their shitty website.  \n\nThat's great, but this still doesn't solve the problem of paying $100 a night for a hostel during the summer in Europe. It looks like prices are crazy over the summer there. I've heard of idealista bust from what people say you need a multi-month lease to get those prices.",

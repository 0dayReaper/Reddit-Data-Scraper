    "postText": "I\u2019m finally traveling to Georgia! I\u2019m combining it with a trip to Iran and Armenia. Georgia is the last stop. I can only spend 7 days in Georgia unfortunately because of work. \n\nWant to get your feedback on this itinerary. I have eliminated Svaneti and Borjomi because it\u2019s quite a long way from Tbilisi based on what I\u2019ve read. So I\u2019m focusing on the areas below. \n\nMy biggest question - is it worth having an overnight stay in Sighnaghi? Or should I just do it as a day trip from Tbilisi? \n\nAppreciate your response. Safe travels!\n\nJan 6 - Arrival in Tbilisi from Yerevan \n\nJan 7 - Tbilisi &gt; day trip to Mtshketa \n\nJan 8 - Tbilisi &gt; day trip to Gori + Uplishtike\n\nJan 9 - Tbilisi &gt; Sighnaghi\n\nJan 10 - Sighnaghi &gt; Kazbegi \n\nJan 11 - Kazbegi\n\nJan 12 - Kazbegi &gt; Tbilisi \n\nJan 13, 2AM Saturday - Leave Tbilisi ",

Perhaps you've been before and you're using it as a base, and that's fair enough, but if you haven't I'd really recommend taking at least a full two days (ideally more) to spend time in the city.",

If you'd like to visit Sighnaghi they also do a [wine tasting tour](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/AttractionProductReview-g294195-d13857682-From_Tbilisi_Kakheti_Wine_Region_Including_7_Wine_Tastings-Tbilisi.html) that stops there. I think that would be a better option that spending a night there.  \nHopefully that should give you an extra couple of days to explore Tblisi itself.",

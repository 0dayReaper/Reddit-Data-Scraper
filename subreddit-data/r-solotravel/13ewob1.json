    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019ll be traveling to Chile shortly (probably should\u2019ve asked this before but here it goes). I\u2019m traveling to Chile for 2 weeks and want to see several places, however I feel time might be too tight so I want some thoughts from someone a bit more experienced than me.\n\nItinerary:\n\nDay 1: Arrive in Santiago and transfer to Vi\u00f1a del Mar.\n\nDay 2 &amp; 3: Explore Vi\u00f1a del Mar &amp; Valparaiso\n\nDay 4: Early morning bus ride from Vi\u00f1a to Santiago Airport. Flight from Santiago to Calama.\n\nDay 5 &amp; 6: Explore Atacama on bicycle and maybe a couple tours. (Death and Moon Valley, geysers and hot springs or salt lakes)\n\nDay 7 through 10: Take 4 days/3 Nights trip to Uyuni Salt Flats and Back (Would rather do a 3 day tour but I\u2019ve yet to find one that returns to Atacama on 3rd day)\n\nDay 10: Fly back to Santiago on same day i return from Uyuni.\n\nDay 11-13: Explore SantiagoDay 14: Fly back home\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n\\- I want to visit all those places but wouldn\u2019t mind having to cut Vi\u00f1a and Valparaiso.\n\n\\- I was thinking i could stay a night in Atacama before returning to Santiago after Uyuni trip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour opinions are much appreciated. I just want to make the most out of the trip but, at the moment, it feels as if I\u2019m going to spend way too much time traveling rather than getting to know the places i\u2019ll be going to and the people there.Thanks in advance.",

There are modern buildings, casinos, restaurants, etc. I would 100% recommend staying in Valpo over vina and doing the free walking tour right away to get a feel for the street art and things to do. Stay near cerro alegre. I\u2019d only go to vina for the concon dunes for sunset but you can do this via the local busses easily back and forth and cheaply",

San Pedro imo has enough options to do things for 3 full days and your day from Uyuni to Santiago seems a bit hectic so I'd agree with your thought to cut one day from Santiago and add an extra night in San Pedro. \n\nOtherwise itinerary seems great to me. Don't think it's too rushed.",

    "postText": "I'll be flying into Portland near the end of the July, and I'll be in Oregon for around 12 days. It looks like an incredibly beautiful state and there's so much to see! My plan is to rent a car for 7 or 8 days and drive around to check out some of the state parks, camping where I can (I already have a few days booked in Crater Lake and Bend).\n\nI don't have a complete itinerary yet but checking out Mt. Hood, the Bend area, Crater Lake and the Redwoods are a must. However, driving the coast also seems essential. It'll be a lot of driving but I'm not too concerned about that -- though I'd like to fit some hikes in too. I'd love to hear some tips/suggestions from any Oregon residents or people who've explored the state before. Thanks :)\n\nEdit: I'm vegan so if you know any places in PDX or Bend that offer quality plant-based food, let me know!",

            "comment": "Oregon resident here. I wouldn't give more than two days to Portland. There's so much to see in Oregon you could easily fill a 10 day road trip. \n\nMy personal highlights would include:\n\n1. Astoria. Oldest and most historic town in Oregon. I love the vibe here, great breweries and food. \n\n2. Driving the Old Columbia River Highway and stopping off at Crowne Point and all the waterfalls along the way. Get started early or you'll get ensnared in traffic.  Drive all the way to Hood River. \n\n3. Maybe the most scenic drive in all of Oregon (controversial) is highway 242 that goes from Belknap Springs over McKenzie Pass to Sisters. It's absolutely insane, like driving through a volcano wonderland. \n\n4. Ecola State Park near Cannon Beach. If you've seen the movie \"The Goonies\" this will look instantly familiar. \n\n5. Heceta Head Lighthouse. Beautiful lighthouse with trail that goes up from the beach to a lookout over the lighthouse. If you're up for it, you can hike a trail over the ridge to Hobbit Beach on the other side. The nearby town of Yachats is a quaint coastal town worth stopping in.\n\n6. If you're heading down the Oregon coast towards the Redwoods, stop at John Dellenback  Dunes State Park right off U.S. 101 south of Reedsport. Miles and miles of huge sand dunes that you can spend hours hiking in, and OTVs aren't allowed in the state park, which is nice. This my little hidden gem. \n\n7. For the Redwoods, Jedediah Smith State Park and Prairie Creek Redwoods SP are can't miss. Drive Howland Hill Road near Crescent City. \n\nFavorite Oregon towns:\n\nNewport, Yachats, Astoria, Hood River, Sisters, Silverton, Corvallis, McMinnville \n\nI could go on all day about other places you can visit, but I'm sure you have your own ideas and there's quite a lot to see. Feel free to DM if you have any questions.",

If you want to do a fun and moderately challenging hike, you can catch the Pacific Crest Trail there and do a 5.5 mile out-and-back hike to Little Belknap Crater. Awesome volcanic landscape. You can also veer to the left and hike up Big Belknap too and look down into the crater if you're up for it. Wear decent hiking shoes or boots.\n\nEDIT: I mentioned Heceta Head, which is also an awesome spot for sunset. Another great stop nearby is Cape Perpetua, which is the highest overlook on the Oregon Coast. You can either hike or drive to the top.",

Do the Old Columbia River Hwy in the morning, then lunch in Hood River. Then take Hwy 26 south around the eastern flank of Mt Hood towards Government Camp (doing it from this direction gives you the best views), and stop at Timberline Lodge. \n\nFrom here, you can either go back towards Portland (if doing as a day trip), or proceed down to Bend (which is 2 hrs). I would go on to Bend, which you can use as a base to see Crater Lake and other sites that interest you (try and avoid Crater Lake on the weekends or on a holiday, it's absolutely bonkers there). The Newberry Volcano monument is worth checking out. \n\nNow head west towards Sisters, where you will take 242 towards Eugene. Sisters is also a neat town to spend a couple of hours walking around. Catch I-5 in Eugene then head south to Crescent City to visit the Redwoods. Then from the Redwoods, drive north up the Oregon Coast on U.S. 101. Depending on how much time you have, go all the way up to Astoria, or if time is short, cut east towards Portland via Hwy 18 north of Lincoln City. You can stop in McMinnville for some wine tasting if that's of any interest.\n\nEDIT: in essence, the road trip part of your itinerary would look something like this:\n\n3 nights in Bend\n3 nights Crescent City (gives you two full days to enjoy the Redwoods)\n2 nights going up the Oregon Coast",

Crater lake is great but unless you go\nIn august you can\u2019t swim so there\u2019s not much to do other than looking at the lake. Id also recommend some stuff in the central part of the state. Toketee falls along the north umpqua and tamolitch blue pool/ cougar (terwilinger) hot springs along the mackenzie River are great.  Opal pool and 3 pools are fun too.",

You can google Vegan + Town name and get a pretty good list. ([https://www.worldofvegan.com/portland-vegan-restaurant-guide/](https://www.worldofvegan.com/portland-vegan-restaurant-guide/))\n\nI personally love the coast and bring everyone that visits there first.\n\nI would drive from Portland (PDX) to Astoria. In the airport, one of the grab and go spots has Happy Hoage which is a vegan sandwich. I am not vegan, but I personally like Veggie Chick. \n\nGoto the Astoria Co+op (featured on Top Chef) for your vegan food. I like driving the bridge to Washington and Cape Disappointment is pretty close to checkout.\n\nWarrenton has a shipwreck you can walk to. \n\nSeaside has the promenade and is fun. Ecola park is nearby as well.  \n\nCannon Beach has the haystack rock \n\nTillamook has a Cheese Factory that is free to visit.  \n\nPacific City has a huge Sand Dune\n\nLincoln City has a casino, if you are into hikes... God's Thumb is great. \n\nDepoe Bay is the smallest bay in the world, but just fun watching the waves hit the bay. There is a whale that lives around there as well. \n\nNewport has the bay area. \n\nThis can be rush through a day, but I would suggest one night in seaside area. I usually head home after Newport, but here is some more information on the other coastal towns farther south. If you go from bend to the coast, I would start at Newport and head north (opposite of what I posted). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlorance is a retirement type of beach, but very much enjoyable. Also has a casino.\n\nCoos Bay/North Bend has a couple casinos. \n\nGold Beach has the rouge river and jet boat tour.\n\nThe last stop is Brookings which I plan on visiting at some point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLocal favorite restaurant is McMenamins for the atmosphere and not the food. The hotel branches are worth visiting (McMinnville, Portland, Bend, Forest Grove) because you can kind of explore the hotel and the restaurants inside (with a drink!). \n\nHood River is a great place to visit as well if you enjoy drinks, similar to Vegas where you grab a drink and walk outside. You may want to stop by on your way to Mt Hood.",

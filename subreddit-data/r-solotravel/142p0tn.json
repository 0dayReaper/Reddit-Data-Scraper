    "postText": "Hi everyone,\nI\u2019ll be doing my first solo trip to London in October, which I\u2019m very excited about. I\u2019m mostly interested in museums, sightseeing, trying food, and walking around as much as possible to see the different neighbourhoods. I also like cool bookstores. I\u2019ve been planning my itinerary and wanted to see how realistic it was. I\u2019m okay with taking things out if I spend too much time at one thing. \n\nDay 1: \n-Arrive to London at 1pm; check in at 3pm\n-Don\u2019t plan on doing too much on this day; I\u2019m staying in South Kensington so I\u2019ll be walking to Holland Park, Kensington Palace, and maybe Little Venice.\n\nDay 2: \n-Westminster Abbey; I haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019ll be paying for a tour or just sightseeing. See the nearby College Garden and Jewel Tower.\n-Westminster Palace/See Big Ben. \n-Lunch\n-Walk to St. Jame\u2019s Park and Buckingham Palace\n-From there, go to Fortnum and Mason; walk to Trafalgar Square when done\n-See the National Gallery; if I have time, go inside.\n-Dinner and Neal\u2019s Yard/see other interesting areas/shops nearby, whatever I walk to.\n\nDay 3:\n-British Museum; I\u2019m allocating 4-6 hours for this.\n-Camden Market; explore the area as well, walk by the canals. Eat lunch.\n-Regent\u2019s Park\n-Go to Daunt Books in Marylebone, check out the neighbourhood.\n\nDay 4: \n-Victoria and Albert Museum\n-Natural History Museum\n-Go to Harrods\n-Hyde Park\n\nDay 5:\n-Tower of London; I\u2019ll likely be paying for the tour so expecting to spend a few hours here.\n-See Tower Bridge \n-St Katherine\u2019s Dock and then walk to St. Dunstan in the East.\n-Leadenhall Market; lunch here?\n-See St Paul\u2019s Cathedral and then get dinner\n-Walking by the Thames\n\nDay 6:\n-Tate Britain then lunch\n-Uber Boat to Greenwich; see the Observatory, Greenwich Park, eat dinner.\nAnything else interesting in Greenwich?\n\nDay 7:\n-Deciding between an Oxford or Bath day trip\n\nDay 8:\n-Paid tour of Stonehenge? Or do the Seven Sisters hike? \n\nDay 9:\n-Flight is at 2pm; breakfast, then off to Heathrow. \n\nThis is what I have so far! Any must sees I should include? Or anything on my list that isn\u2019t worth seeing? I\u2019m definitely a planner so I can\u2019t see myself just \u201cwinging it.\u201d Thanks for the help!",

            "comment": "As a English guy, I would advise this: \n\nGo to Windsor instead of Stonehenge. A day out there is much more interesting. Train isn\u2019t far from London and walking around the castle, the mile long walk and exploring parts of the Thames and Etonian areas is lovely. \n\nTry and see something on the west end. Anything. Its fairly pricey but honestly one of my favourite things about London.\n\nHampstead Heath is also lovely to walk around - its so big and you can explore many beautiful independent cafe\u2019s and shops around it. \n\nReading the other comments - they\u2019re all suggesting great ideas - and I am sues a few tourists would be able to provide their opinions because thats also a good opinion to hear from those who visit us.",

I\u2019m a little envious but feel your itinerary could be overwhelming. My favorite thing was on the first day, we checked into the hotel, had dinner of fish and chips and then after dinner we just rode the tube, hopping off and wandering at interesting stops. I wouldn\u2019t know if they are still there, but there were tourist maps inside the cars near the train doors that showed points of interest at each stop - this evening gave us the lay of the land for further explorations. Regarding your comment about Westminster, I would definitely pay for the tour - you\u2019ll never find all of the interesting graves and hear a condensed version of why they deserved to be buried there if you go on your own. I also loved the tour at The Tower of London. I\u2019m pretty sure you can\u2019t go there without doing a tour.  If I remember, it was one of the big ticket items but was worth it since our tour guide was so great.  I spent several hours at the British Museum and probably only covered half of it. I loved it so much, but my feet could only take so much. I went to Bath and Oxford, on separate trips, and honestly could not choose between them. One of the highlights of Oxford happened without planning -  we were in a famous pub without knowing they were having a Pub Quiz. The locals encouraged us to enter so we did. We finished about middle of the standings which we were proud of considering the competition. Have a great trip!",

I spent a few days there with friends and then solo, and this is what I would recommend:\n\nThe most important thing is that you download the City Mapper app to help you get around London. The public transportation is really reliable and easy to figure out once you get the hang of it. You\u2019ll save a ton of money too. As an example, I took a cab from Heathrow to my hotel by the Tower bridge and it was around \u00a3130, but on the way back I took the tube and it was \u00a313. Uber can be unreliable in the city.\n\nIn regards to using public transportation - if you are on an escalator heading to the tube/train, stand on the right side if you just want to stand and ride the escalator!! The left side of the escalator is for people rushing who are going up and down the steps!\n\nBring a good jacket/sweater with you!! There is a lot of wind that comes from the Thames and it does get quite chilly in the morning and evenings, especially if it\u2019s cloudy.\n\nI did the Natural History museum and the V&amp;A and both are absolutely incredible - don\u2019t skip these. Do the Natural History museum right when they open if you can to avoid the crowds and screaming kids.\n\nIf you go to Greenwich, make sure you go visit the Painted Hall. It\u2019s absolutely stunning and only takes about an hour if you do an audio tour.\n\nDon\u2019t do Stonehenge - it\u2019s underwhelming. I did a tour of the Dover white cliffs and I was blown away by how beautiful they and the countryside were. We were lucky that it was Sunny that day and on the warmer side. I also saw Dover castle and Canterbury which I also liked, but the white cliffs was my favorite part.\n\nLike others said, try to do either Sky Garden or the Shard. We did both - they are different vibes but offer great views of the city!\n\nMy girlfriend did the Tate Modern and also did the dinner pairing that they offer on their terrace - she said it was amazing!\n\nKensington Palace has a neat fashion exhibit going on right now if you can nab some tickets in advance. While you\u2019re there you could also try to grab Afternoon tea at the restaurant they have on site.\n\nAnywho, long post but I hope this helps! You\u2019re going to love it!!",

If you do want to fit so much into a day then do it in a day that the museums are open late.\n\nIn fact definitely incorporate museum late opening hours into your plan. They\u2019re really fun to visit at night and less crowded. \n\nDay 3: again super packed, British museum is huge and your legs will be hurting at the end of it. Day 3 is in my former neighbourhood- I have a soft spot for this. I would suggest combining a west end show with the British museum so that you can rest your legs in the evening. There are lots of ways to get rush tickets for cheap - just google it and you\u2019ll get the latest options. \n\nIf going to the British museum then east in fitzrovia. It\u2019s a cool hip neighbourhood with many restaurants. Also it\u2019s worth taking a stroll around Bloomsbury for the architecture and because it\u2019s where a ton of London\u2019s intelligentsia lived.\n\nIf going to Camden market definitely try the cheese restaurant.\n\nThe canals, Primrose Hill and Regent\u2019s Park are lovely, do not miss (even though you\u2019ll probably have to do it another day). Marylebone is my former neighbourhood so I have a soft spot bht beyond daunt books and a couple of nice spots there isn\u2019t much to do. The Wallace collection in Marylebone is really nice. Worth seeing.\n\nDay 4: again a tiring day. Maybe do a museum and then sitting in a cafe People watching or even just chilling in Hyde Park so that you\u2019re not museum-Ed out. If you go to the Natural History Museum, then the gems exhibit gets crowded so go there early. The burger place near South Kensington station is really nice.\n\nDay 4; yes definitely walk down the south bank and absorb the atmosphere. Good you\u2019re visiting a food market, that\u2019s a good thing to do in London. Can also visit Borough Market or Greenwich market when you go to Greenwich. Leave some room for spontaneity in your stroll along the south bank \n\nDay 6: you can get away with spending half a day in Greenwich. It\u2019s pretty but not much to do for the full day for a tourist with limited time. East in the market if you want .\n\nYou can spend half a day here and add something from a previous day (many of which are super packed). As others have said, Tate modern is worth a visit\n\nDay 7: can consider Cambridge as well. Bath is kind of far for a day trip and it\u2019s nice but I\u2019m off I\u2019d go that far unless you\u2019re really into Jane Austen. Also you\u2019re sure to be exhausted by this point so maybe spring for a fancy spa experience of you do go to Bath \n\nDay 8: agree with the others that Stonehenge is nice but quite out of your way. Frankly, I don\u2019t know whether you would have the physical energy to be walking as much as this itinerary calls for, for 8 days straight. I used to do weekends like this when I lived in London but Monday I\u2019d be back to my desk job nursing my aching feet. \n\nLike would you have energy for Seven Sisters, as lovely as it is? If you do end up there, no shame in talking a bus for part of it. Don\u2019t remember the place name but at one point you\u2019re nearly at sea level and there\u2019s a restaurant and others and stuff and there\u2019s a bus there that gets you up the next (steep hill). We did that and got off at the top of the hill and walked down.\nAnyway my top recommendation for you is to incorporate some performances and shows into tie schedule. One should hopefully be west end but not all have to be. I\u2019ve seen plenty of lovely performances for \u00a310. It\u2019s a huge part of the London cultural scene and will allow you to rest your feet a bit as well. \n\nAll the best! London is my favourite city and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy yourself!",

Probably be cheaper to but I\u2019m not sure. \n\nOr you could use coaches and trains, coaches taking longer but being way cheaper. Will require more planning. \n\nEither way will require you to spend a night away from London in one of the other cities however, which I don\u2019t know is feasible for you \n\nBut just an idea hope it helps",

See the nearby College Garden and Jewel Tower. -Westminster Palace/See Big Ben. -Lunch -Walk to St. Jame\u2019s Park and Buckingham Palace -From there, go to Fortnum and Mason; walk to Trafalgar Square when done -See the National Gallery; if I have time, go inside. -Dinner and Neal\u2019s Yard/see other interesting areas/shops nearby, whatever I walk to.*\n\nI'd start with Green Park and walk past Buckingham Palace and St. James Park to Westminister. The Westminster tour is interesting for the history and insider access - book ahead. College Garden and Jewel Tower are skippable IMO, instead consider walking across Westminster Bridge to the small garden in front of St. Thomas Hospital - great views of all of Westminster from there. From here, you can walk past London Eye to the Jubilee Bridge, cross over to Charing Cross, and reach Trafalgar Square. You could head to Fortnum &amp; Mason if you like, but I'd rather walk past St. Martin's in the Fields toward Covent Garden and Neal's Yard - there's a more interesting selection of shopping and eating there while F&amp;N is more of a tourist/expat trap. In Covent Garden, the Transport Museum is quite interesting.\n\n*Day 3: -British Museum; I\u2019m allocating 4-6 hours for this. -Camden Market; explore the area as well, walk by the canals. Eat lunch. -Regent\u2019s Park -Go to Daunt Books in Marylebone, check out the neighbourhood.*\n\nIt'll be good to look up the collection at BM and shortlist what you definitely want to see, just to use your time more efficiently - the place is packed to the rafters otherwise. From BM, you can walk up through the college district (UCL, SOAS, UoL) towards King's Cross - St. Pancras (worth a look for their modern lobby and castle-like exterior respectively, and the kitschy Platform 9 3/4 prop if you like that), from where a very pleasant canal-side walk leads from Granary Square straight into Camden. Camden is a bit quiet on weekdays though, so you should ideally head here on weekends to see the place in all its glory. The same canal will head down to Regent's Park, but IMO, you should head up Primrose Hill instead and get a nice sunset view. Grab some wine and a takeaway meal from Camden (there's a huge Sainsbury here as well as several smaller places) to enjoy here! Also check out any performances - Camden has many night spots with great acts.\n\n*Day 4: -Victoria and Albert Museum -Natural History Museum -Go to Harrods -Hyde Park*\n\nSounds sorted. I'm not the hugest fan of Harrod's - its a trap like F&amp;N but more Arab-money friendly. If you do Hyde Park on Day 1 itself, then you could use the evening to head out to Hampstead Heath - its a beautiful city forest and the views from Parliament Hill are lovely.\n\n*Day 5: -Tower of London; I\u2019ll likely be paying for the tour so expecting to spend a few hours here. -See Tower Bridge -St Katherine\u2019s Dock and then walk to St. Dunstan in the East. -Leadenhall Market; lunch here? -See St Paul\u2019s Cathedral and then get dinner -Walking by the Thames*\n\nI'd rather start at St. Paul's, walk down through The City (past the modern icons like Lloyd's, Gherkin, Leadenhall Market (no great lunch spots here though), Dunstan, the Walkie Talkie (the terrace garden has great views and is free) and grab the tour at  Tower of London in the late morning. From here, walk across Tower Bridge to City Hall and get some nice views. Then along the river, past HMS Belfast, maybe dipping into Borough Market for lunch (closed on Mondays), below the Shard, and on to Tate Modern (great modern art collection, and the view from the upper terrace toward Millenium Bridge and St. Paul's is lovely).\n\n*Day 6: -Tate Britain then lunch -Uber Boat to Greenwich; see the Observatory, Greenwich Park, eat dinner. Anything else interesting in Greenwich?*\n\nTate Britain is nice, but I wasn't too bowled over by it. Greenwich is quite large, and if not Uber Boat, then the DLR from Tower Gateway / Bank is a fun way to get there (try to sit up front!), or you could take the DLR from Canary Wharf tube itself (the station is an architectural icon).  The Observatory is a bit underwhelming, but the Maritime Museum is a fun wander, and the Queen's House is architecturally very important. The views from Greenwich Hill towards the towers of Canary Wharf are great too. In the evening, head to the Oxford Street area - while the main drag is a busy shopper's district, the side streets are great - Carnaby has a lot of interesting boutiques, Bond Street has many Royally endorsed shops, Regent Street has the high end stores leading right up to Piccadilly and Leicester Square, and SoHo is full of cool bars and caf\u00e9s.\n\n*Day 7: -Deciding between an Oxford or Bath day trip*\n\nBoth are great! I'd actually skip Stonehenge which can be very underwhelming on a crowded and cloudy day.\n\n*Day 8: -Paid tour of Stonehenge? Or do the Seven Sisters hike?*\n\nDidn't do the Seven Sisters Hike, so no comments. But if you like coastal scenery, do have a look at the Jurassic Coast - the Durdle Door and Lulworth Cove are beautiful too.\n\n*Day 9: -Flight is at 2pm; breakfast, then off to Heathrow.*\n\nSimple enough.\n\n\\-\n\nOn cool bookstores, I prefered Waterstones (there's a large and historic one near British Museum) to Daunt.\n\nIn terms of neighbourhoods, if you're okay knocking out a day trip, you could explore upcoming eastern London instead - the walk from Spitalfields Market to Brick Lane via Shoreditch High Street lets you have a look at the edgier, creative side of London with lots of street art and neighbourhood markets. Further afield, Hackney has many cool pubs and restaurants that only locals know.\n\nElsewhere, the Kew Gardens are worth the trip out of town and have beautiful glasshouses. Richmond Gardens will give you access to free roaming deer and a castle.\n\nI'd do the day trips against weather forecasts and not slot it right at the end strictly. It won't be fun heading all the way out when it's raining or cloudy.\n\nIf you like theatre, then a Westend show is a must. It's pricey, but the production quality is top notch. The Globe is another option for Shakespearean plays, but its not as good as Westend stuff.\n\nUse Citymapper to navigate (it'll help you save a few pounds as well by routing you outside of Zone 1 wherever possible), and scroll through the articles on Timeout London - its a decent insider's perspective in to the goings-on in London. Also, dress in layers, and carry a sturdy umbrella (or a very cheap one that you don't mind losing or upturning when its too windy). Finally, don't shy away from using the buses - they're actually a better way of getting around the city centre than the tube, and you can sit on the upper deck too!",

I went to London, rented a private room, rented a bicycle and just bicycled my butt off for a couple of weeks bumping into stuff here and there,.. I'm at the British museum one day by chance, the tower the next etc   I love gardens, architecture and the streetscape and eating and restaurants of course just discovering as I go.. I love the surprise.. You obviously like it much more structured with few surprises, but my recommendation for you from me, the  opposite extreme, would be to slow down, not schedule so much.   It's okay to miss a few things, and smell the roses in between. Don't schedule yourself up so tight. Leave yourself the afternoon just to wander around or a whole day. Just sit in the cafe and enjoy London 150 ft around you..any where, St pancras, watch the people trains etc.   Just my thought. Slow down and let some stuff just happen. Sometimes just let the list of things you have to check off that you have seen, fall to the floor.. something else interesting and unknown will reward you",

Day 3 sounds particularly impossible given the British Museum\u2019s opening hours, but I think you\u2019re right to allocate 4-6 hours (definitely not less, should be enough if you focus on the highlights). To maximise your time I\u2019d consider moving some stuff to the evening, such as Camden and Harrods, or even museums if they have a late night during your stay. Also, I feel like London parks are quite similar to each other so you may skip some of those if you\u2019re not really into it. \n\nCovent Garden is a cute spot that you might want to consider. \n\nGreenwich also has Cutty Sark and a university with some nice neoclassical buildings. It\u2019s a nice quiet(er) area but not a must see in my opinion. \n\nCan\u2019t speak for Bath but Oxford seems perfect for your interests. If you like bookstores check out Blackwells and it\u2019s Norrington room. Not sure if the Bodleian is open to the public but would be worth checking out too. I\u2019d prioritise just walking around and visiting colleges, but if you have time the Ashmolean is like a smaller British Museum.",

I'm actually heading back for a few days before meeting friends on the continent. \n\nI did a free walking tour of London when I got there- it was a nice way to orient myself. I also booked a pub tour on trip advisor that was a lot of fun- learned a lot about London history and the history of the individual pubs we went to. I think I used the Rick Steves Audio Europe app for Westminster Abbey. He has a lot of self-guided walking tours that are pretty good. I did the Beefeater tour at the Tower of London- it's free with admission. The woman was really interesting- and one of the few females to have that gig. There is a pizza place in Neals Yard that is quite good. Also, Hoppers for Sri Lanken food. Have fun!",

I suggest doing some research beforehand on what you want to see. I also liked the V&amp;A, but it's bigger than I thought.\n\nAlso, when visiting most Church of England Cathedrals in the UK (including Westminster Abbey), you may find yourself in there longer than planned. This is because they really put signs up everywhere and show off the history. You can expect some small exhibitions, maybe hear a choir as well. \n\nOne of my regrets in London was not leaving the city for a bit. Don't get me wrong, London is excellent - but so is Bath, Oxford, Stonehedge, etc. A Bath day trip may work better, because it's more compact and you can see most in one day.\n\nEnjoy London!",

Go to the queens museum at the top floor.\n\nI was in Bath for 2 days and I felt I needed one more day to do Bristol. Brighton day trip sounds doable.\n\nGo to Courtald gallery or check out museum of London docklands. Tate modern maybe.\n\nBritish museum was overwhelming AF. Need a whole freaking week in there!",

Just look around, they\u2019re probably near-Ish to a bar or restaurant. It\u2019s WAY nicer than McDonalds on Oxford St.\n\nI used to live in Oxford and I\u2019d pick Bath.  So much to see in Bath. In Oxford a lot of the colleges are behind gates etc.\n\nIf you want to go to Stone Henge it used to be possible to contact the National Trust and book to go at dusk, and you could go amongst the stones, there were only limited numbers and it\u2019s wasn\u2019t over crowded and awful like it can be. I did this many years ago so they may not still do it, but it was pretty brilliant.",

            "comment": "Day 1: consider a walk thru Hyde park since you\u2019re somewhat in the area. You may be able to google events in Hyde park and see if there\u2019s something happening there one of the days you\u2019re here. \n\nDay 2 maybe add SOHO and carnaby street to the list. Neal\u2019s yard is basically in soho. This is the kind of area that you can just walk around find interesting things as a visitor. \n\nDay 3 might be able to squeeze in a walk thru St Johns wood. It\u2019s cozy little neighborhood with a cute high street. The Marylebone high street (daunt books) is also very cute.\n\nDay 4 seems like a museum day.\n\nDay 5: if you\u2019re at St dunstan, look in to visiting sky garden, the shard, London bridge and borough market. There are lots of cute little old time Londony streets and walkways on the London Bridge side of the Thames.\n\nDay 6: I can\u2019t speak for Greenwich but you\u2019ll be close to isle of dogs and London royal docks. I\u2019m not sure what month this occurs, but at the royal docks they set up an artificial beach with fake sand and beach chairs. There\u2019s a gondola from the o2 arena that crosses over the water etc etc.\n\nDay 7 sounds nice either way.\n\nDay 8. Stonehenge was cool to me. I got to see it during the summer solstice a few years back. There\u2019s a party at Stonehenge for both solstices. I remember when I was arriving thinking it was a magical, mystical journey but after I was there 15 minutes I kind felt like I had seen it all. I guess I\u2019m somewhat neutral on the experience but having grown up in the US in the 80\u2019s I had to see it with my own eyes.\n\nDay 9: if you\u2019re on virgin airlines, get to the airport a little early and pay for the lounge pass. LHR\u2019s virgin lounge is one of my favs. \n\nAlso, What kind of food do you like? I\u2019ll try to recommend a few places to eat at while you\u2019re here.",

Just pay for entry and time your arrival with when a Beefeater starts their tour. - It's at no additional cost. Listen to a few of their stories and then walk around with the handheld audio tour and see the rest at your own pace.\n\nSee a show on the west end. - Book of Mormon is fantastic and hilarious and I highly recommend that. TodayTix has last minute tickets and is worth checking the day of. If you're going solo I reckon you'll be able to find a decently priced ticket to any show. \n\nChurchill's War Rooms is a great museum. Definitely worth visiting for an hour or two if you're into WW2 history.",

    "postText": "Does anyone else have the worst luck with taxi drivers? This profession seems to attract the sleaziest people on the planet. It's to the point where I dread going places that don't have public transit or rideshare apps. I'd rather walk an hour than take a taxi. If you are forced to take a taxi, since you are often in their car when the sketchy stuff happens, you are defenseless. Below are my  most recent experiences with jerk drivers.\n\nTbilisi - I arrived at the airport around 1am. I check Yandex and Bolt ride share apps and am quoted a price (it was in the $15-20 range) but there are no drivers nearby. At this point I had no choice but to get a taxi. As soon as you walk past the secured area of the airport, you are immediately hounded by taxi drivers or people asking to give you a ride. I hate airports that allow this and I'm almost certain the local authorities are in on the scam. I walked outside and a bunch of them were standing around chatting. They were wearing a badge with lanyard around their neck so it looked official. \n\nOne of the guys approached me and I said \"ok, let's go to the city center\". As we were walking towards his car, he was being really nice with small talk and calling me friend (this is usually a bad sign). I asked for the price to the city center. That's when his demeanor changed. He said it's meter based and couldn't give an exact price. I calculated the distance on Google Maps and asked for the price per KM so I could calculate myself. Once again, he couldn't give me the price, even the cost per KM. We arrived at his car which wasn't an official taxi but a white SUV. That's when I had a bad feeling. He pulled out his cracked phone and opened up some rideshare Driver app (he said this was his meter) and finally gave me an estimate price. It ended up being more than double what the rideshare apps quoted.  I said nope that's more than double what it should be and started walking back to the terminal. He followed me and kept saying \"why no ride brother?\" and \"what's wrong?\". Outside of the terminal, two other guys approached me and asked why I didn't want a ride with them and were acting aggressive. I said \"I'm not paying your scam prices, so please leave me alone\". I finally got a Bolt driver to accept. As I was walking to the car, the scam driver was yelling things at me. \n\nParamaribo, Suriname - I had no problems with taxis here except for one. They don't have ride share so your only option is calling a taxi company to pick you up or finding one on the street. The host at my guest house told me that taxis should cost no more than 50-100SRD to get places in the city center. I had a taxi called to the guest house to take me about 10mins away. The fare was 100SRD. After exploring a bit, I was burning up hot so I hailed a taxi on the street. The taxi had an official looking taxi sign on top but the car was slightly beat up looking. Whatever, fine. As soon as I got in, I saw that there was a guy in the passenger seat. That's when I immediately felt uncomfortable. On the way, the guy in the passenger seat had the window rolled down and was cat calling women and saying nasty things to them. He asked me if I wanted any Suriname \"taki taki\". I said I didn't understand and he dropped it. Right before we arrived, the guy in the passenger seat said the price is 500SRD. I told him that I have been getting taxis all over the city for 50-100SRD and that's the official price. He said that this is a street taxi, not an official taxi and the price is 500SRD. I told him I'm not paying that much and 100SRD is the most he's going to get. I tossed the money at him and left the door open.\n\nBucharest - This was actually an Uber driver. The guy picked me up at the airport and I noticed he was driving a really long way to get to the city center. A 19km ride ended up being a 30km ride. Thankfully Uber makes it easy to report these drivers and they refunded the extra amount charged instantly.\n\nI do have some suggestions for avoiding asshole scam taxis.\n\n1.\tTake public transit or rideshare. You have an agreed price before the driver even arrives. If there are any price issues, you can submit a ticket and it will be resolved quickly. If not, take it up with your credit card company. \n2.\tIf you are forced to get a taxi, try to agree to a price before you get in the car. Once you get in, it\u2019s more awkward to leave and sometimes the doors are locked from the inside. \n3.\tAsk if they can write a receipt. I say I\u2019m on a work trip and in order for my work to reimburse it, I need a receipt. Scam taxis will almost always say no.\n4.\tSome airports (this seems really common in Mexico) have taxi kiosks where you pay someone working at the kiosk and there is a flat rate based on where you are going. Usually the city center is one flat fee, no matter which street. After you pay, you have a receipt/ticket and you just give that to the driver. It's nearly impossible for them to scam you since they aren't the one calculating the fare or collecting money.",

I told them to piss off and went around the corner to catch the local bus instead.\n\nAnd 100% about the rikshaws - in Delhi several years ago I got off a bus from Agra and had been dropped off somewhere a bit random, so got out Uber and was quoted 57 rupees for a car ride to where I wanted to go, but since there were tuk tuks already there I figured I'd speak to them about getting a ride. They quoted me 500 rupees. 9 times the rate on Uber for a CAR!!! When I told them this they began to haggle with me and wouldn't go lower than 250, lol. So I just got out and ordered an Uber for 57. FWIW I'd have paid 100 to the tuk tuk if he'd been reasonable",

            "comment": "Sorry you've had bad experiences with taxi drivers. I've had some too. Thanks for the great tips at the end.\n\nA few of my tips.\n\nResearch the transportation options at the airport before your trip. Most airports have a website. Find the page for \"transportation\" or \"ground transportation.\" That page will describe the various ways of getting into the city center. \n\nThat's how I found out about \"minibuses\" (they're just vans) at Hanoi airport that cost a fraction of what taxis charged. The downside is they wait until they're full before they drive off. On the bright side, minibuses are popular with locals so you usually don't have to wait too long. \n\nSometimes the hotel or hostel will have directions with public transportation on their website. The really savvy hostels will even have a video that shows the whole journey from the airport to the hostel. \n\nIf you have to take a taxi, if possible buy a prepaid taxi fare from a taxi counter. Or use a taxi dispatcher who is standing around and not hounding you to buy from them. Same as what you described in Tip #4.\n\nAvoid taxis that are lingering at the airport, hotels and tourist sites. Those tend to be the ones that overcharge. Try to hail a moving taxi. Great if it's a taxi that is dropping off someone else, the taxi driver is usually happy just to get paid on the way back into town, which they would have done anyway. I've heard some travelers say they intentionally walk over to the departures side of an airport to catch taxis there because they're less likely to overcharge.\n\nKeep your luggage with you in the backseat, if possible. Not the trunk. I've heard that taxi drivers in some places will hold your luggage hostage and not open the trunk until you pay up. The backseat is feasible with a backpack, but maybe not with large rolling luggage.\n\nHope this helps.",

On the way back, there was a parking lot full of taxis all offering to take me back for twice the price it had cost to get there in the first place - clearly scams.  Finally I found a taxi who offered to take me back on the meter, rather than fixed price.  By the time we got to my hotel, the meter read twice what it had cost me to get there (no unusual traffic, etc.) - I had found the taxi with a rigged meter.  \n\n\nI knew I was scammed, but I think it was about $20, when it should have been $10, so not enough to really get upset about.  \n\n\nThe moral of the story is - you are going to get scammed by taxi drivers in tourist spots.  Just decide that it's part of the cost of traveling, factor it into your budget, and don't worry about it.  (Yes, there are alternatives - but for instance, multiple times I've had Uber double their price with surge pricing right when I needed to get to the airport.  One way or another, they're going to make me pay.)",

I had decided to take a taxi to my hotel from the airport (FCO) anyway. But while I was walking to the taxi line, a guy saw me and asked if I was looking for a taxi, I said yes and he told me he was a taxi driver. We got to his car and I noticed right away, it did not look like an official taxi but I was so tired and was just ready to be at my hotel already after the long trip. We started leaving the airport when I realized he did not even have a meter in his car. In hindsight, I should have probably asked him to stop. He ended up taking me to my hotel, which was a 35 minute drive from the airport. This man charged me 120 euros for a 35 minute ride!!! I was so shocked, I could not believe what I was hearing. It was my first time in the city and I didn't want to start arguing with him right there on the road, so I ended up paying it. But I've learned my lesson, next time, I am packing lighter and most definitely taking the train. Also, thank God, I wasn't kidnapped right? lol. If it's not an official taxi with a meter, I am NEVER getting in again.",

(Never stayed there again) I wound up in the same situation, in a car down a strange road heading to the airport (I hoped) with a crazy meter price, just hoping he wouldn't kidnap me.\n\nAfter that either friends picked me up, or I arranged with a car service ahead of time, but TBH Rome is my least favorite large European city. If it's not the cabs, it's the scams with the 'Roman guards' at the Colosseum, or the vendors that never leave you alone. Even Venice is calmer.",

The \"flat rate\" he quoted me was close to $40 when the cab I had taken from the airport from the official post was maybe $15?\n\nIn Malta, I was stuck on the opposite side of the island from my hotel and it was absolutely pouring rain and no Bolts were accepting my request. Similar to Zagreb, a guy in a cab van pulled up and told my friends and I we could go and it ended up being 60 euros even though every other van cab we took from bolt that week was 15 to 25.",

    "postText": "Hi all!  \nI'm doing a solo Euro trip from June 14th (land in London 1845) - Aug 31st (I haven't actually booked a flight home but this is my ball-park date for leaving). I think I need some help on whether I'm packing too much in/if I should get a Eurail pass (15 days in 2 months or 2 months continuous) or just pay for trains/flights as I go.  \nI've never done a solo trip to Europe (I did a 1 month with friends last year) so am hoping to see as many different things as possible without getting too burnt out/spending my time in transit. I'm really into food and I love meeting new people and getting lost in cities, not too fussed on organised tours nor huge hikes but I am keen to do a few. I'm really hoping to stay under 20k AUD - do we think this is possible?  \nThis is what I have at the moment; it's very loose and needs more experienced eyes than mine!\n\n  \nLondon - 5 nights - (flight to Galway booked)  \nGalway - 3 nights  \nDublin - 4 nights (flight to Berlin not booked)  \nBerlin - 4 nights  \nBrussels - 4 nights  \nAmsterdam - 3 nights  \nFrance - 7 nights (want to include Nice/French Riviera and am open to suggestions)  \nSpain - 12 nights (want to include San Seb/Seville/Valencia/Barcelona)  \nItaly - 14 nights (want to include Milan/Como/Florence/Rome (have spent 4 nights here in the past)/Naples/Bari/Capri/Pompei/Venice - Lake Garda/Dolomites) I know my Italy leg is a mess rn so I'd really appreciate help here  \nLesce Bled - 3 nights  \nCroatia - 8 nights (I'm thinking Split/Dubrovnik/Hvar)  \nGreece - 7 nights (Athens/Milos/Santorini)\n\n  \nI'm then thinking of meeting my sister back in London before flying home. Is there too much going on here? And does this trip suit a Eurail pass, flying or just getting a 15 trips in 2 months (Eurail)? Sorry for all the questions but I am open to any and all suggestions. Really appreciate any help! Thank you so much.",

I'm not a fan of Milan...it's mainly good for luxury shopping so if you're not into that you might want to give it a miss. I would also eliminate one of the two lakes. I've never been to Bari but I doubt it's worth including in your itinerary given your time constraints.",

Spain is a little short with only 3 days per city on average, and then Italy you have 11 places to see in 14 nights ? 14 nights would be fine for Como / Florence / Rome, or Naples / Pompei / Capri / Bari  but not all of those unless you only want to see the inside of trains.\n\nI haven't been to Croatia or Greece so can't really help but 7 nights sounds short for Athens + 2 islands.\n\nDon't book trains as you go especially the long disnace ones between Amsterdam - France - Italy, they get more expensive the longer you wait. Eurail gives more flexibility but will be more expensive than booking in advance.",

I mean, you can knock out Venice in a day or two, but you\u2019ll also wind up being there with all the hordes from the cruise ships, and won\u2019t have time to wander around the corridors at night by yourself. \n\nOne thing that might help is just basing yourself in Florence for a bit. You can see all there is to see there, and it\u2019s centrally located so you can take day trips to other towns. \n\nYou can get to Milan in two hours, or Rome in 90 minutes. Siena is two hours, Pisa is one. \n\nIt might help if you narrowed down your purpose there \u2014 is it to see historical sites and experience the culture, or is it to see landscapes and the seaside?",

For example, you could narrow it down to Naples, Pompeii (half day trip), Capri, and Bari (Puglia is so pretty and will take more than five days to explore). \n\nGreece: 7 days is not enough. I would recommend giving the islands at the bare minimum 3 nights. Athens deserves 4-5",

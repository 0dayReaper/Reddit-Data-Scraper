            "comment": "That's amazing. I remember during my first ever solo trip. I checked in to the hostel and was waiting for my bed to be cleaned. Sat at the bar, was feeling nervous regarding starting a conversation. I noticed the gentleman at the bar had an elaborate tattoo on his arm and I figured, everyone has a story behind their tattoo. So I decided to ask him about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's how I started socializing and I have been at the same hostel a couple more times since then. As a way to pay forward the kindness that this place showed me, I always try to familiarize the people who have checked into the hostel, specially if they seem nervous. I do recognize those gestures as I used to do it myself, such as checking my phone constantly and avoiding eye contact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish covid goes away soon so that I can travel solo once more. It's one of the greatest pleasures of life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother thing that I noticed was that when I am out with friends, the way I communicate is influenced in a way. But when I am traveling alone, the words that come out of my mouth is my true self, unadulterated.",

Like back home ill go to a cafe for food but I wouldnt go to a restaurant alone, but abroad I no longer think twice about it. I quite enjoy a trip to the cinema alone. Last time I was so lucky, I went to see 1917 in imax and had the entire cinema to myself",

So much to overcome though; \u201chostels anxiety,\u201d striking and holding convos with strangers, actually pushing myself out of the room and into the public lol .. But it all starts with one step, and I swear I\u2019ll take it.\nThank you\ud83d\udc99",

I was in Brussels and I really wanted to visit the Delirium bar I\u2019d heard so much about, but I couldn\u2019t find anyone super friendly at my hostel to check it out with me. I made myself go there alone and make a friend when I got there. I was so nervous the entire walk but I knew I would feel bad about myself if I turned around. I ended up finding a friendly table that let me sit with them and they turned out to be an amazing group of people that I joined for the next two days. Three years later and I am still riding the high that accomplishment for myself, and it\u2019s definitely helped me go out of my comfort zone more.",

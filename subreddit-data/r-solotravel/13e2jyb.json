    "postText": "I\u2019m thinking about spending about a week in Mexico City during the Dia de lost Muertos celebrations. \n\nThe holiday is on Nov 2, but that\u2019s a Thursday. I assumed celebrations would be that Friday, Saturday as well but some online guides say that Oct 31-2 and the preceding weekend are the bulk of celebration days. \n\nAnyone know which days are best to catch the bigger parades and general atmosphere? I\u2019m thinking Friday Oct 27 - Friday Nov 3 to catch the main holiday. But worry about missing stuff the weekend of nov 3.\n\nAny ideas? Or general tips for that week? Thanks!\n\nEDIT: Not sure about this and don\u2019t want to be ignorant, but I\u2019m reading that the parades may not actually be as commonly depicted. I hope there\u2019s still plenty to do though!",

But it is worth seeing. I skipped it last year and went to Oaxaca instead for the holiday. There will be face painters available during the parade and it'll start at the Zocola and ending at Chapultepec. Personally I would catch the parade at the park. It's the largest park in N.A. and has lots of stuff to do and just relax. I'm debating if I want to go back to DF or Oaxaca for the holiday. This husband didn't go with me last year and he's been wanting to go to Oaxaca so might go that route.",

It is not something part of the traditional celebrations https://mexicoinmypocket.com/blogs/blog/did-you-know-that-mexico-citys-day-of-the-dead-parade-was-created-because-of-a-james-bond-movie",

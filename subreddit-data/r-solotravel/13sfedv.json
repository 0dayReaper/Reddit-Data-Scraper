The only thing I need with a power board is one Charging adapter from the Canadian model to thai mode.",

Instead of multiple travel adapters, one adapter (and one backup adapter) plus a power bar (power board) that I can plug all my devices into to charge.  \n\n\nYes it's okay to bring it in your carryon, I always do just in case checked luggage is lost or misdirected.",

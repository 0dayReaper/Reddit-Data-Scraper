    "postText": "When planning my trip to Uzbekistan, I found it difficult to find up to date info on some of the more practical side of things, so I thought it would be a good idea to post some first hand info in case someone finds it useful.\r  \n\r  \n**Me**: 43M, solo trip (try finding someone to come with you, people mostly seem confused when you bring it up:) 'OK so Uzbekistan, which one is it?')\r  \n\r  \n**General**: If you are considering visiting the country, but have some doubts or fears whether it is worth it: yes it is. Go. It is interesting, full of world class sights, complex and interesting history, excellent food, and the people are very-very friendly, chatty and nice.\r  \nDepending on your backgroud, Uzbekistan may be very exotic or less so. If you are from or familiar with Eastern Europe, the Causasus or other post-soviet areas, you will see a lot of stuff that will be at least vaguely familiar (architecture, old soviet era vehicles, trains, the whole of Tashkent).\r  \n\r  \n**Security**: It never occured to me anywhere that I would not be safe, or my stuff would not be safe. The only notable exception is traffic, in UZ drivers don't slow down for pedestrians, they just honk :)\r  \nThere are stories from years ago how the police stops tourists and checks passports/visas in the Tashkent metro and some other public places. It seemed to me that those times are over, in fact all officials I met were very polite and friendly.\r  \n\r  \n**Getting in/out**: I traveled on an EU passport, no visa required for tourists for up to 30 days. They inspected my passport on arrival, took a picture, asked a few mundane questions ('Is this your first time here? Are you going to Samarkand?'), it took 5 minutes and I was in.\r  \nLeaving the country actually took more time with further staring at my passport, one more photo and endless lines. Make sure you are at the airport well ahead of time when you leave (2 hours).\r  \nDuring your stay, all accommodation will issue a **registration card** when you check out. The card will list the from-to dates you stayed there and you must have your whole UZ stay covered with these cards. If the accommodation does not provide it on checkout, ask for it. All this said, no one asked for these cards at the airport or otherwise, not sure if they even check it. A receptionist told me that the printed cards are useless anyway as everything is online. I collected them either way, better safe than sorry (in the past the lack of these cards came with huge fines apparently).\r  \n\r  \n**Transportation**: This one was a little tricky for me but it turned out well. The plan was to arrive in Tahskent, fly to Khiva (there are plenty of domestic flights, new planes with good service), then take the train between cities on the way back.\r  \nIn UZ, the rail works a little like airports: you must buy tickets online, they have passport and security checks at the station, you have assigned seating. Tickets are available a few weeks ahead and especially for the fast trains they go fast. My issue was that I could not book tickets ahead either on the website of through the app, both crashed during the booking process. In the end, I booked the Khiva-Bukhara train with the help of my accommodation, and took shared taxis between Bukhara-Samarkand and Samarkand-Tashkent. Some details:\r  \n\r  \nKhiva-Bukhara: the train ride is almost 8 hours and costs around USD10. Slow train, older train, lots of locals, hot, nothing to see for hours just the desert with scarse flora. Seats are bunk bed style and the \r  \nrail provides bedsheets and such, still not super comfortable. Rustic little experience, people invite you to eat with them, you see the countryside, I still would book a flight or find a shared taxi in retrospect. \r  \n\n\nBukhara-Samarkand: shared taxis leave from Buxoro Avtoshov Bekati (Bukhara Bus Station) and the trip will be somewhere btw USD10-15, depending on how much you care about being ripped off for a couple of dollars. It takes around 4 hours. There are some buses too, but bus services in UZ are scarce so call ahead if you prefer that. In Samarkand they drop you off at Registan square by default.\r  \nSamarkand-Tahskent: Shared taxis leave from the lot next to the Ulukbeg Observarory, hard to miss. In Tashkent the dropoff is at Olmazor metro station. 4 hours, 10 dollars.\r  \n\r  \nShahrisabz side trip: taxis leave from Registan in Samarkand. I took a private car for USD40, 1.5 hours each way and the driver waited for me for 2 hours on site. Still a steep price for UZ standards, I did not mind on this occasion.\r  \n\r  \nBetween cities you can always opt for a private car, it will cost but there are many options for this.\r  \nYou can haggle with drivers, good luck even if you speak Russian. Shared taxis leave when they have 4 passengers, this usually takes little time as locals use them heavily.\r  \nCity taxis pick up and drop off passangers en route so don't be surprised that it is not only 'yours'. Airport taxis or negotiated private cars are only for you.\r  \nAt the time of writing the local Uber called YandexGo was removed from Western app stores and even installation blocked if downloaded from a third party (you can bypass this with some research, I did not bother).\r  \n\r  \n**Accommodations**: Very good quality, much better than expected. Staff is usually very professional and in smaller establishments also very friendly and chatty. I went with small boutique hotels and a guesthouse in Khiva. There are many options in each city, and they are often concentrated in a certain area.\r  \n\r  \n**Prices**: Once you are there, UZ is a cheap destination. Accommodation prices max out at the lower end of the European price range and value for money is very good. Food is USD4-5 in a local restaurant, USD10-15 in a more elegant one.\r Water or soft drinks in shops are 50-80 cents, a metro ticket in Tashkent is 10 cents, can of beer around USD1-1.5, USD2-3 in a restaurant. Taxis are USD1-2 in cities. Entrance tickets are around USD2-5, if more than they provide access to more sites (e.g. Khive old town). \r  \nUSD is accepted and very welcome almost anywere, make sure you have lower denominations (5-20, hotels and money changers also take 50-100). If you pay with USD, it will be calculated USD1=10.000 som, this is somewhat worse than if you exchange it. EUR is exchanged but I heard the rates are worse. Exchanging is easy, some hotels do it or call their guy to come in, or you can just walk along a bazaar and half of the merchants will ask. I also used a European issued VISA card and it worked everywhere.\r  \n\r  \n**Health**: Eat what is freshly made, don't eat unwashed fruit/vegetables, don't eat bats, usual rules. Tap water is drinkable in Tashkent, not recommended elsewhere. I had minimal stomach issues, but Central Asia is known for this so be careful.\r  \n\r  \n**Booze**: Alcohol is available in dedicated shops and sometimes in normal corner shops. Alcohol shops are everywhere, no issue finding one if you want to pick something up. I tried some local beers, \r  \nSarbast and Pulsar were OK, a couple of others were not so OK. Drinking in the street is illegal I believe, I never saw it.\r  \n\r  \n**Food**: Absolutely fantastic, plov, shashliks, hearty soups, sausages until the eyes can see. Very much a meat centered diet, however if you don't eat meat, you will still a huge selection of salads, vegetables, fruits, nuts and sweets.\r Breakfasts in every accommodation was huge, varied and delicious.\r  \n\r  \n**Time**: I spent ten full days in the country, this was enough to see everything I wanted, plus travel between locations. To see the sights and explore you may plan a minimum: Tashkent 2 days, Khiva 1 day, Bukhara 1 day, Samarkand 2 days.\r  \nTashkent and Samarkand are the best choices to hang out for additional time, Khiva and Bukhara are too small and the options are limited. I saw many recommendations online to spend more time in Bukhara, I found the place less interesting, it had a tourist mill vibe I dislike, I enjoyed the other cities more.\r  \n\r  \n**Language**: If you speak Russian (I don't), you will have zero issues. In hotels and more tourist oriented places English is fine, otherwise no one speaks a word so a lot of pointing, gesturing and smiling is needed but everybody is nice about it and I never had any issue. \r  \nSome people even like a good chat if you have no common vocabulary which is very entertaining and a good laugh. Generally, it is a good idea to learn basic Russian expressions and words you might need (please, thank you, goodbye, bread, beer, numbers etc.).\r  \n\r  \n**Telecom**: internet is good, wifi is everywhere, hotel wifis were excellent. You can buy a local SIM if you like, they offer them all over the place. I did not so I cannot speak for that.\r  \n\r  \nTraveling in UZ is easy and fun, people are friendly so no worries if you are planning to go.",

Black/grey market currency exchange was common, and people were carrying around large bags full of cash because the denominations were low. Nobody took USD then either. It's quite something to hear how much things seem to have changed in a few short years.",

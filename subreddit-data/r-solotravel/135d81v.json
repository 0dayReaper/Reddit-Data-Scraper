    "postText": "TLDR; I (30F) would like to go on an Amazon rainforest trek that'll challenge someone that's a bit on the weaker side. Any general tips or tour options?\n\nSo I'm not  gonna lie.... I'm a bit of a weenie. My hands are soft. I work in an office. I can't stand mosquitoes. \n\nNevertheless, one of my childhood dreams was to go gallivanting in the Amazon rainforest.... avoiding sandpits, jaguars, and poison dart frogs with cool background music. But as a 30 year old, I'm not delusional enough to believe I could actually make it more than 2 hours in the real wilderness. Still, some sort of adventure tour in the Amazon is something I dreamed of and I'd like to visit soon-ish before my knees turn into actual dust. \n\nI googled around for tours, and while some look interesting, many seemed either too relaxing (e.g. pure river cruise) or too extreme (e.g. 5 day treks through the wilderness). I guess I'm looking for something more in the middle.\n\nIn terms of physical conditioning and previous relevant experience, I've been on 6 week camping Safari in Botswana. I've also been to Everest Base Camp in Tibet. However, both were relatively simple as buses/jeeps carried anything heavier than a small backpack. I've gone hiking in the Yellow Mountains during winter though, and I have survived Disney World and Singapore Zoo full-day tours in the hot humidity. I'm more than willing to sleep in a tent and use the wild as a toilet. I could probably do around 10k treks on a fairly flat and/or marked trail without too many difficulties. Still, I'd like to be realistic and not create a medical emergency by getting lost or injured due to inexperience.\n\nOther considerations: female traveling alone. Would probably travel either in the Southern hemisphere summer or during the late winter of the Northern hemisphere. Fluent in Spanish. Would want a tour of at least 7 days, at most 2 weeks. I'm particularly interested in animals and wildlife, especially learning more about their behavior and conservation efforts. \n\nAnyone got any tips, ideas, tour operators, things to keep in mind etc. for someone in this kind of situation?",

Pro tip, try not to book any tours online, they jack the prices way up since they know the western tourists all book online. The tour companies usually know English so I\u2019d recommend showing up and booking there. Most tours aren\u2019t super extreme at all and usually try and make it sound more adventurous than it is.",

Just find a lodge that does guided day excursions; they have different levels, but even the \"extreme\" day trips are just a hike through the forest.   \n\nAlso for mosquitoes: get a container of permethrin and spray all your clothes before you go, this has worked very well for me in the past. Also don't wear anything too tight as they can and do bite through them. When I did the Amazon I wore fishing clothes I treated with permethrin and used a DEET stick on my neck/wrists/ankles. Literally no bites.",

We went on a couple canoe trips a day and usually a hike a day (only a short one, 90 minutes or so). In the time between the canoe trips and walks you can wander around yourself or go for a swim in the river.\n\nIt was definitely not a hardcore trip. I stayed in a private lodge with an ensuite. I went in December, barely any mosquitos, I didn't even need bug spray in the day. \n\nI went for four days and loved every minute. Pop them a whatsapp message, and remember there is nearly always room to negotiate prices. If you just book the first price you see online, it will undoubtedly be a hiked up price. Of you can save $30 on the tour cost, thats $30 more than can be tipped to the cooks or canoe boys.",

You can either take the tourist bus which costs $60 or take public buses. For when I was going, public buses would have dropped me off the night before and considering overnight accommodation it would have cost similar to the tourist bus. However this may be different for when you plan to visit. The public bus journey is also not direct and won't be as safe as the tourist bus.",

We stayed at a \"resort\" there and swam with pink dolphins....it sounds cute but they look scary. Also, the river water was black where we were.....lol\n\nBring picaridin..at least 15% to save yourself from mosquitos. I like the brand \"sawyers\". And for the love of gawd...do not use any kind of fruity scented lotion. A female used herbal essence/bath&amp;body works and holy sheeet she was eaten up by mosquitos.\n\nBrazil is going to be your typical pickpocket/purse/do not wear jewelry/no expensive branded clothing type of place.\n\nMy aunt lives in the bigger cities there and house/car robberies are normal. There are some officers who work with thieves at GRU Airport where they inspect your bag to take note of what's worth stealing then relay that info to their friend outside. If you use a US passport, you'll probably be a bigger target.\n\nIt would be safer to have somebody there to pick you up instead if dealing with the taxis....it's the usual scam you can find in Peru, dubai....anywhere actually these days. Uber is a better option also.",

It includes uncatalogued species in virgin rainforest, natural savannahs and creeks. Several streams of crystal clear warm water run through the rainforest. \n\nDuring tour the guide will lead clients, educating them about the local flora/fauna, how and where to find edible fruits and potable water, first aid , how to find their way in the forest and much more.\n\nDuration: 1 to 3 hours\n\nMonkey Forest \n\nThe facilities for rehabilitation and re-introduction of wild animals in their habitat (known as the Monkey forest), was created in 1991 with the intention of receiving animals which have been confiscated from illegal commerce. This is a joint project with the Municipal Secretary of Environment and Sustainability.\n\nIn this center, the animals are initially put into quarantine to be evaluated and taken care of by a team of veterinaries and biologists.\n\n \n\nIn partnership with the FFV (Live Forest Foundation), A nonprofit institution overseen by Amazon Ecopark Lodge, a unique feeding system has been developed.\nTwice a day, (10:30 &amp; 15:30), the animals receive supplements of their natural diet, ensuring that they are being fed the necessary nutrients.\n\nThe Monkey Forest is open to guests at feeding times, always accompanied by credentialed professional, permitting guests to film and photograph these animals in a natural and safe environment. It is also possible to \u201cadopt\u201d one of these animals and follow its development.

Alligators are spotted because their eyes shine like small red lights. Once the alligator is spotted by the guide\u2019s spotlight, he will try to catch a small alligator with his own hands and bring it on to the canoe, and a brief explanation of their habitat follows. The alligator will then be safely released back to the river. (No harm is done to any of the animals)\n\nDuration: about 1 hour.\nNote: during \"high water level\" season (from April to August) and on full moon evenings, it might be difficult to find alligators.\n\n \n\nTOUR TO THE \u201cMEETING OF THE WATERS\u201d \n\nDeparts ECOPARK at 08h30am on board of a regional double deck boat. The boat goes down the Negro River navigating along the shore of the City of Manaus, allowing passengers to view the Amazonas Theater, the Port of Manaus, the Customs and the interesting aspects of the local life - the stilt houses for instance. Arrival at the Meeting of the Waters by 11h30am.\n\nIt\u00b4s a spectacular merge of Negro and Solim\u00f5es Rivers. From this point on both rivers form the famous Amazon River that runs all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. The waters of the two rivers run together for about 12kms, side by side, without mixing. The phenomenon happens due to differences in temperature, density and speed of the waters of the rivers.\n\nContinue the trip on the Amazon River to the Island of \" Terra Nova \" where a typical restaurant (rustic yet clean restaurant with buffet style, international and regional dishes) is available for lunch Depending on the level of the waters, a visit to a typical \" caboclo \" (local inhabitants) villa will be included (at Terra Nova Island) during this full day tour (may not be available during the months of May, June, July and sometimes also August, when the villa is flooded) . This visit will happen prior or after lunch.\n\n \n\nNOTE 1: During high level of waters the place of the option of lunch can also be changed to a restaurant located at the \" January Lake\" , another beautiful place and , in this case , there is no visit to the villa.\n\nReturn to the lodge and arrival by 05h30pm\n\nDuration: about 09 hours\nNOTE 2 : Time for an optional visit to the National Park of January is programmed (at extra charge).\n\n* The distribution of the tours will be coordinated by the local operation department. \n\n \n\nNOTE: The Inn also offers several optional tours (not included in package) such as: \n\"Swim with the pink dolphins in the Upper Rio Negro\", \"city tour of Manaus (\" City Tour \"),\" Visit to an indigenous community, \"\" Rubber Plantation Museum \"etc. (sales  at the hotel)\n\nMEALS: Meals mentioned in the packages will be included provided they meet the schedules of our restaurant.

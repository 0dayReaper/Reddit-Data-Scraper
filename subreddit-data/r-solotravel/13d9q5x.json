    "postText": "I have about 12.5 days between Greece and Istanbul. \n\nMy trip starts June 28 until July 11. I am thinking 4.5 in Crete, 4 days in Athens, and 4 in Istanbul. I will be traveling alone with luggage so looking for convenience in terms of public transportation and good social hostel stays. Maybe I should cut out Crete entirely and go to a different more manageable Greek island or not at all? I am trying to also figure out how to cut down on transportation costs. \n\nIf anyone has any recommendations please comment! This is my first time to all of the destinations, but would really love to see all of them.",

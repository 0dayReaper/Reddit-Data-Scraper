    "postText": "I just had my first solo trip in Croatia. I was honestly quite anxious before the trip and was glad it mostly went well. I had loads of fun and met really amazing people. I had a travel fling with a local too and I still miss him after 2 weeks \ud83e\udd79 I keep wanting to share my current experiences in my own country with him because I know he'll love it but I'm holding myself back because of the distance between us :/ Please tell me how to get over a fling or if I should just tell him.\r  \n\r  \nNow I'm kind of addicted to solo travelling and want to do it again. I want to work or study in Europe just so I can travel there for months. Is it crazy that I'm searching for jobs/universities and calculating costs just to travel again..\r  \n\r  \nBut for now, I have a week or two off during Xmas till New Year (about 10-11 days). I know it's gonna be expensive but I'll save up. I'm not too sure where's a good place to travel during that season. I'm not looking at Asia since I'm from there and I'm a petite female so I'm hoping to go somewhere I can feel safe at. I was thinking of Europe again and I heard that the Xmas markets will be great but it's also freezing cold and less daylight so I'm not too sure. It seems that Canary Islands or Portugal are warmer during that season so I was considering that. Does anyone recommend Canary Islands during that season and does anyone know how are the NY festivities like there?   \n\n\nTentative plan looks like this: Madrid, Tenerife, Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria (maybe 2 nights each)",

    "postText": "I'm planning 10 days' trip in late June (open to Cambodia/Thailand too) starting at HCM. \n\nI am looking for a place that's NOT crowded but not dead either (opportunities for socialising preferred). I like more rural areas but also the comforts of a nice resort/hotel. Also somewhere safe (am solo female).\n\nInterested in snorkelling, diving lessons (never done it), surfing (super newbie), chilling in bars &amp; lots of relaxing. \n\nI know My Khe beach is popular but I am not fond of beaches next to modern towers.. (anyone feel the same?)\n\nI can ride scooters but am inexperienced so can't do 2 hour journeys. I'd prefer something that I can go to without a private tour/vechicle due to cost concerns. \n\nLooking for real testimonies/experiences not just \nsuggestions off an article, please.",

Hotel was across the street from China Beach, which was moderately crowded with people exercising, taking photos, and strolling from sunrise until about 10 a.m. It's a really fun part of the local culture to behold ... especially as the sun rises over the ocean. \n\nBy 10, it's too hot to enjoy vigorous exercise. That's when relatively small numbers of skim boarders, sun seekers, swimmers, and beach tourism companies (surf lessons, boats pulling people on kites) come out. Petty beaches, lots of casual dining options nearby. \n\nJust after evening twilight, the beachfront restaurants fill with boisterous families, exercise dance clubs, leisure cyclists, teens, and lovers. It was safe and fun to mingle with the crowds. The people I met were really nice! \n\nCentral Danang and suburbs aren't terribly crowded by Hanoi standards. Plenty of inexpensive restaurants to choose from. A few dance clubs and plenty of interesting shops to browse line the relatively compact central city core. \n\nI also took the bus to Marble Mountain (which I thought was very cool!), and later to Hoi Anh from Danang. I highly recommend 2-3 nights in Hoi Anh,  too. Chill vibes, lots of colorful photo opportunities, tourist friendly, plenty of backpackers (if you want to hang out with a Westerner crowd), night market, lantern boat rides, more terrific little vietnamese restaurants and caf\u00e9s. Best of all, other than around dinner time, the city feels relatively uncrowded.",

My 2nd trip to Thailand and Vietnam (and 1st time in Malaysia)\n\nI spent several days each in: Danang, Hoi Anh, Hue, and Hanoi, Vietnam. Hanoi was very crowded and hectic ... but probably the most alive and engaging city I've ever been to (Note: sorry, Tokyo ... lol!). The other cities are smallish and relatively uncrowded. \n\nOf course, I grew up in NYC and enjoy crowds, so our definitions of crowded may be wildly different :-)",

Right now, it\u2019s still school season but might be more crowded June/July. I would definitely try to visit Hoi An even though you want to avoid the crowds. Lmk if you have more questions",

Do you have a international driving permit? \n\n I legitimately know how to ride, but I don't have a license because I haven't got the time to return to my country (something about spending all my annual leaves travelling lol) and make a license.\n\n\nAny other activity suggestions in that area?

For beaches, Cat Ba island was actually my favorite stop. Cat Ba has 3 different main beaches and a hidden beach, they were all quite nice and never too busy while I was there. You can also do boat trips into the bay for different activities while there. Also renting a bike to drive around the island was awesome, the roads are well kept both along the coast and through the jungle, so it's both safe and beautiful.",

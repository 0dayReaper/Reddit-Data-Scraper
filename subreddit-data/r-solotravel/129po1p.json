    "postText": "just wanted to share some thoughts; I wish I had someone tell me this years ago. I\u2019m pretty shy until someone approaches me first and typically not one to make conversation off the cuff. I\u2019ve read hundreds of blogs, tik toks, and this page especially for tips and itinerary\u2019s for traveling, and a lot of this content concerns meeting people and finding someone to do things with. That\u2019s certainly nice while traveling solo but not necessary. You don\u2019t have to make a thousands friends and connections, you don\u2019t look weird eating alone, you don\u2019t look weird going to excursions and tours alone. Enjoying solitude in new places is just a fun, to me at least. So, you can be shy and still have fun while traveling solo.",

Meet people in hostels, go on the tours., go to clubs together. \n\nAnd those who don't. Those who book hotels or quieter, less social expieriences. Those who are mostly alone when they travel. \n\nI'm in the second group. The truly alone. I don't make a thousand friends. Don't travel with those I've met I'm hostels. Do see people in tours I've gone on, briefly. Speak with them. Enjoy travelling that way. And whilst I was nervous eating alone at first, I've learned that nobody cares what you are doing. And if they do, so what? You are in another place, you will never see them again. They will not say anything.",

Some people are just able to go at a faster pace than others.\n\nI don't socialize with other people when I solo travel because I don't want to socialize with other people when I solo travel. Even if you gave me a few extra days, I would just use that time to go do other things. Just because I have the extra time doesn't mean I want to go find friends.",

People on a weekend city-break - well, you don't have a huge amount of time, you need to be back home on Sunday evening for work, you have a set amount of annual leave and you will make as much of those days as you can. \n\nMan, it would be nice to be able to go back to the laid-back backpacking long-trips, but...hitting 30 soon, more responsibilities now, a job, mortgage that would still need to be paid if I go abroad long term. Not so possible to do these days.",

Less questions. \n\nFor my job I have to speak in front of an audience or have long meetings. Plus meeting friends, having a family at home...

Being outgoing and social is a skill, and like anything else in life you can get better at it (even if you are shy). \n\nI used to get tons of social anxiety as a teen and would be scared to talk to strangers. Last year I solo travelled for the first time, and made a concentrated effort to talk to new people and get out of my comfort zone. I was anxious every time and a lot of interactions were a bit awkward. But I kept pushing and now I can easily strike up conversations with strangers. Even if I get an anxious feeling before talking to someone, I accept it and do it anyway. \n\n\nIf you are reading this and solo travelling, please make an effort to get out of your comfort zone and be social on your trips. You will not regret it and your future self will thank you!",

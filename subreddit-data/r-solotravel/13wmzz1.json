    "postText": "Hi all. I'll be visiting a family member in Antalya in August and I plan on spending a week on the turquoise coast area. What are the best places to visit for someone looking to chill and enjoy the beach (29M). I was thinking Antalya, Fethyie, kas, and maybe Bodrum. \nAny other places I should add or remove? I will not be renting a car, so I would mostly be using the bus.",

If you\u2019re into paragliding, you can do it at Oludeniz Beach near Fethiye. \n\nIt was a surreal experience seeing the beach from above. In Marmaris I went on a quad safari which was super fun too.\n\nOh and Marmaris is about a 6 hour bus ride away while Bodrum is 7 so if you\u2019re short on time, maybe you can skip them.",

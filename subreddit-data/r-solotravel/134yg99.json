    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI have very tentative plans to go to a concert at The Ford in early August. To be frank, I've never been interested in LA but this show might just bring me there.\n\nI've read that the City's bus system is fine, and it certainly looks comprehensive so I'm aware that this option is there. I'm perfectly willing to take Ubers and probably plan on it. \n\nGenerally speaking, I just don't care about places like Hollywood. If anything, I want to avoid it. However, since The Ford is in that area, that's pretty much not going to happen. I'm not much of a nightlife person (I'm a coffeeshop and book type of tourist, very quiet), but I obviously want to stay somewhere that is safe at night. \n\nI'm also not a Hostel person. I'll be in a hotel. I tend to find myself in young, hipster type neighborhoods. I'd still *love* to visit Dodger Stadium, I love museums, but the size of the City and how spread out it is makes it pretty daunting to me.\n\nI think my best bets are Koreatown, Downtown, or just sucking it up and staying in West Hollywood. \n\nAnywho, if anyone has any suggestions, I would seriously appreciate it.",

            "comment": "LA native here. I\u2019ve never been to the ford, but it\u2019s not easily accessed by transit aside from an hourly bus. I\u2019d just Uber/lyft there and if the show doesn\u2019t end too late, the walk down to main Hollywood area isn\u2019t too bad and you could grab a cheaper Uber/lyft or a bus. \n\nJust get a hotel in West Hollywood. Not a bad area and not too far from your venue. But if you want more quiet, you can also check out Silver Lake (super hipster area) but safe\n\nFrom West Hollywood and Silver Lake, you can take LA Metro route 4 (fairly frequent route and runs 24/7) to either Santa Monica or DTLA (you should mark specific things in DTLA you want to see, but there is a lot to see and worth it). Santa Monica is the most easily accessed beach via transit and the pier is pretty cool. Route 4 will also take you close to dodger stadium (you just need to walk up a REALLY big hill) although idk if the inside of the  stadium is open to the public if no game is happening. \n\nMake sure to download a TAP card on your phone (in IOS, you had by going to wallet and transit passes). It makes it easier to use transit when the card is on your phone. Fare is 1.75 (bus and rail) with 2 hours free transfers. Downtown Glendale and Old Town Pasadena are also cool spots to go if just to walk around.",

To get to the Ford I suggest taking a Metro train to Hollywood / Highland station and then either walking up or grabbing a bus. The walk isn't too bad. \n\nMuseums: The Getty is an absolute must. It is a world class art museum with incredible views of the city. You would, however, need to grab an uber to this one. Other museums I strongly recommend are The Broad, LACMA and Academy Award Museum. \n\nTo get to Dodger Stadium take a train to Union Station (an attraction to visit in itself) then walk to the Dodger Express. It's a bus system that takes you right to the stadium",

I would say plan out the spots you want to hit and plan to take Ubers.\n\nI\u2019d plan to hit the Downtown area.\n\nCheck out Venice Beach from there walk to Santa Monica (about a 1 mile or 15-20 minute walk down the beach)\n\nIf you enjoy hiking I\u2019d definitely hike up to the Hollywood sign.",

I visit the greater LA area a lot for work, and I\u2019ve been to both places, but probably never in the same trip. In my mind, Santa Monica seems so much further north. Maybe it\u2019s something to do with the freeway traffic. Next time I\u2019m in the Venice Beach area, I\u2019ll definitely walk along the beach to the SM pier.",

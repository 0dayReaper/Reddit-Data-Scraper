    "postText": "So I've been working remotely for about a year. I figured i may as well take advantage of it and try some travel while working this summer. I'm planning on going for 5 weeks, with one week in Louisville  and one week in Austin Texas, the rest is pretty flexible. If anyone has any advice for places I should stop on the way I'd love to hear it. Hot springs, swimming holes, mountain views.  My itinerary is roughly\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNYC today\n\nLouisville KY \n\nNashville TN\n\nAustin TX\n\nTucson AZ\n\nGrand Canyon\n\nLos Angeles CA\n\nThe bay area, CA\n\nOccidental, CA\n\nSomewhere in the northwest, possibly Seattle\n\nPossibly Salt Lake City UT on the way back unless I go into Canada and drive back in Canada.. Maybe stop in Montreal on the way back to NYC. \n\nHas anyone done West to East like that and how was it?",

But I think a week is too much time there unless you're visiting friends/family and aren't paying for a place or something like that. Also skipping out odd possible stops in PA like [Knoebels](https://goo.gl/maps/vVAgvqheYdbSdhMs9) or [Centralia](https://goo.gl/maps/5nWcwCwukJZ8tt6g7).",

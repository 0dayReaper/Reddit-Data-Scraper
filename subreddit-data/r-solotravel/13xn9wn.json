I would love to rent a car and drive around myself but ive got no idea how good/bad the roads are.\nI posted something in r/ecuador but didnt get the information i was looking for: i'm mostly want to know how the roads are and what kind of car i need. Does anyone have any experience driving around in ecuador and how was it? Can you give me some tips?\n\nI would love to hear about your experience driving there. I know busses and taxi's are  a good option but i like the spend some time driving around enjoying myself and stopping whenever and whereever i want without feeling like a burden.\n\nI'm planning to drive from Quito (get car)-&gt; Mindo -&gt; Cotopaxi -&gt; Insilnivi -&gt; Guardana -&gt; Caluma -&gt; Cuenca -&gt; Guayaquil (loose car)-&gt; fly to galaposgos. in November.  \n\n\nHow are the roads there? Do i need to rent a 4x4 or will a normal car get me where i want to go? Do you have a sugguestion for a renting comapny? I'll be traveling for about 12 days (i'm not really looking for crituque on my travel schedule).\n\n\nThanks in advance \n\nPunkypluis",

The roads in Ecuador are maintained and good to drive, however some sections/parts usually have landslides or floods that may cause detours. Now, in Ecuador most cars are manual transmission (you could also find automatic) but its best to drive manual for the hills and roads there in general, automatic should be fine though. For the parts you mentioned, no need for a 4x4 but if you find a car rental deal for one go for it. Honestly, it looks like you want to roadtrip pretty much the entire country (which is doable but for 1 person it could be hard) just Quito to Cuenca is about 10 hours driving. Another note is safety, the current state of the country is shaky and I wouldn\u2019t recommend being on the road alone for such a long roadtrip. My best advice would be to uber/taxi your way to the terminals and take the buses to each town. Buses are pretty cheap and very reliable/safe. \n\nBest,",

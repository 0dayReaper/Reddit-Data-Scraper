            "comment": "some of the best tacos i had were just on the side of the road. there's plenty of hyped places, i tried cocuyos. tbh found it underwhelming, i got the suadero there. id just look at what ever place has a crowd, google maps might be good too. the \"best\" places are also pretty out of the way and it felt odd to to take a taxi for 30min to get a taco for 5 min and then leave.\n\nsan juan market has some weird/exotic stuff. some woman was pulling boxes of live insects trying to sell me alchohol to go along with it. scorpions, spiders, roaches hah\n\ni took the bus to teotichuan and back. subway to the norte bus stop. and then the bus back. i think you can take uber too. bus was cheap, was 120pesos round trip? its like a greyhound bus, stops in random places, it had buskers and people selling food.\n\nif you havent had oaxcan food, id search out a restaurant and try it while your there. those were the better meals i had. maybe try chapilunes too lol",

            "comment": "Day 1: Make sure to go to Chapultepec Early, the line to enter the castle can get very long. The Basilica is very far and unless you are either Catholic or very admant in going it is probably a place you should skip for the sake of time usage.\n\nDay 2: Coyoacan and the Anthopology Museum are very far away of each other, the Museum is something you can combine with Chapultepec since they are one next to the other.\n\nDay 3: Can\u00b4t help you here but I\u00b4d suggest paying for a tour.\n\nDay 4: You can\u00b4t miss getting some Pozole (red)  in La Casa de To\u00f1o, even if some people say it is overrated. Its great.",

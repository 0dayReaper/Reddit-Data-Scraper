    "postText": "Thanks for reading! I just started traveling more than I\u2019m \u201chome,\u201d and I am having a very hard time getting my controlled substance (klonopin) refilled on the road.  I\u2019m not trying to get more than I\u2019m supposed to have or anything like that.  \n\nMy psychiatrist in Louisiana can\u2019t prescribe to other states.  You can\u2019t transfer the first fill, and if you transfer the second, then the third gets stuck in that location.  I\u2019m not finding an online company that can prescribe controlled substances to most states.  \n\nI do want to get off of Klonopin, but it\u2019s going to take a while to taper all of the way down.\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated!",

Also, as someone previously stated, in some chemists, they might just hand it over.\n\nI've been tapering off my Klonopin usage for a while now and am down to 2mg a day from 4mg a day. Be honest and show flight tickets/travel plans to your home base prescribing physician or psychiatrist. \n\nDo also check with the country before traveling as some countries outright ban Klonopin use, and deem it to have no medical purpose.",

There has been a pretty significant culture change on how benzo's are prescribed in the states and most doctors do not want to deal with the repercussions of patients that are misusing it (not you) and the addictive qualities it has, as I'm sure you see/feel it is very hard to get off benzos. There are ways for physicians to see what controlled substances you have been prescribed and when and if they see multiple different docs prescribing over the span of a few months it raises concerns for \"doctor shopping\" . The best route is to see if you can get more than your typical month supply, or frequently travel back to your state for refills from your current prescriber.    \n\n\nIf you ever run out and start to have signs of withdrawal while traveling go to an urgent care or ED and they will treat your withdrawal and likely give you a very short bridge (like 3-7 days worth).",

    "postText": "I'm going to Vietnam in June. My flight departs on 15th of June at 11.30 PM and i will arrive Vietnam on 16th of June at 6.30 PM. I applied for e-visa. While applying, under the field \"date of entry\" i put 16th of June because I'm entering the country on 16th. And then i got my e-visa from 16th of June to 17th of July. But my friend pointed out to me that I'm boarding the flight on 15th and if they ask for visa then i don't have a visa while boarding. \n\nSo this is my issue. Do i need to re apply for e-visa or is this okay and i won't face any problems while boarding the flight?\n\nPlease help me.",

It IS a performance, but not one you can't easily talk over. Kyle from California playing guitar to pick up chicks IS sharing a piece of his culture. It's a sample of his culture's mating rituals as well as examples of the music that's listened to. I don't think I'll be changing your mind judging by how vehemently you condemned poor Kyle but I'd like to ask you to consider that being bothered by Kyle is a choice you're making and that every point you made could be spun into a positive for someone else.",

All the countries have their own stereotypes and this is definetely an argentinian one. Once you speak really good spanish and start noticing the differences in culture and accents and not just attributing it to personality you see a pattern. Argentinians have a lot of italian decent and it shows a lot in their culture, as a result they are like italians of latin america and also have a really strong hippie subculture that is very defined.",

The only reason I went for that guitar was that nobody was talking to nobody. Everyone was just on their phones or laptops the whole time. I'd try and have a conversation with people when we were in the kitchen but the moment we'd go back to the common room, they'd go back to silence. I found it so weird and sad to be honest. Anyway, I woke up early the next day, no one was around in the common room, so I just grab the thing and start playing Opeth songs watching the rain out of the big window. That was until people started pouring in for their breakfast and I had to stop. The whole experience was bunk but playing the guitar in the morning was great!",

I don't really care if anyone listens, I just want to play my jam. It's easy to tell if people don't want music, in which case I go somewhere else. But I've made places full of dreary phone-scrolling turn into parties with my guitar, and it facilitated people meeting other people they otherwise would have never even said hello to. \n\nSo basically, my two rules are that you have to be good, like actually, undeniably good, and you have to be quick to pack up if people aren't feeling it.",

People would start conversations about music, invite me to things and otherwise just suggest places for me to check out.  \n\nI watched other travellers carry around massive suitcases that couldn\u2019t be wheeled upstairs while I just had a carry on back pack and a guitar so it didn\u2019t hamper me as much as you might think and the positives were just immense.

He was later joined by a German dude playing the fiddle and they fuckin rocked it! Seasoned artists generally are not looking to showboat, it's the aspiring ones playing the same old songs you've heard a million times. If they wanna practice that's fine but not in a common area when people are trying to talk.",

A friend of mine studied traditional music in India for many years. Watching him play \"call and response\" style phrases with other musicians is the most amazing thing. You can convey so many emotions and almost have a conversation without a single word. \n\nMakes me really sad to hear anybody get hate for trying to connect with strangers in this way. ",

As soon as I figure out how to play it I'm going to start doing unannounced late night hostel sessions until I end up at the hostel you're at. And not the Bob Marley version, either. It will be the Fugees version from '96, complete with a fake Haitian accent. You will feel the wrath of my bad reggae! ",

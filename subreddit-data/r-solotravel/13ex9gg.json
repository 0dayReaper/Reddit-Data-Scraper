    "postText": "Hey travelers!\n\nI just got back from a 6 month SE Asia + Amsterdam &amp; Egypt journey about a month ago and it seems that I have about $2500 usd of money left from that trip. I could probably use for many useful things here at home.. but I'm getting that travel itch and I think before I re-enter the rat race of my career that I'd make a quick trip south. The three countries I've been researching currently are Mexico, Guatemala &amp; Belize as they are all pretty close in airline prices flying from California. I mainly want to prioritize diving and seeing ancient ruins; i'm giving my liver and body a break lol. From the reading i've been doing it seems that my money will get me further in Mexico and Guatemala rather than Belize. I am currently leaning towards Belize because I want to dive The Great Blue Hole, but its \\~$400 for 3 dives which is quite punchy. All 3 countries look beautiful so i don't really think i'll go wrong with any of them. All recommendations and comments are appreciated :)\n\n(M28)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've read that Belize may have not been worth the expense, thoughts?\n\nHow much time and money did you guys spend in these countries?",

Guatemala has some of the best Mayan ruins in the world, but is not a diving destination to my knowledge.\n\nBelize has great diving and some good ruins, but they are a little far from each other (but it is a small country).  You would probably split time diving in the cayes and time in San Ignacio (which is a neat town) for ruins.\n\nMexico has great diving and ruins if you focus on the Yucat\u00e1n and Quintana Roo area.  You could base in Merida or Playa del Carmen+Cozumel and have easy access to Chichen Itza, Tulum, cenotes, and top tier diving without traveling far.  Food is much better than Belize in my opinion.",

Roatan is super cheap for diving (like $45 a tank all included) and famous for diving.\n\nThe Blue Hole is super hyped online but after talking with people here it seems overpriced. I planned to dive there but I finally won't - yes the spot is incredible but you can see underwater things as amazing in the Cayes (Caye Caulker and Ambergris Caye).",

I\u2019d personally prioritize Guatemala because I think it\u2019s the most interesting (and cheapest) country of the 3. \n\nFor diving I really don\u2019t think the blue hole is worth that much for 3 dives. Cozumel in Mexico is your best bet for reef diving, and definitely hit up some of the cenotes, they\u2019re amazing. The pit, dos ojos, maravilla, Tajma Ha, Hells Bells, Angelita!! are all great and super unique compared to the normal ocean diving. Angelita is so friggen cool. \n\nAnd of course if you can swing it, Roatan and Utila have some of the best and most budget friendly diving in the Caribbean. \n\nI posted a diving in the Yucat\u00e1n cenotes album if you wanted to check it out :)",

Unfortunately it was October and there was a hurricane so had to run away from Belize (I also wanted to dive in the cayes). I took a car in cancun and drove through Yucat\u00e0n, then down to palenque, into Guatemala, Belize and back. I stopped in some great beach places on the riviera maya (cancun, tulum, playa del carmen, Isla Holbox) but mostly went to see the Mayan ruins. \nTikal in Guatemala is amazing, personally the best I have seen, but I would recommend Mexico just because I have seen more of it. That being said riviera maya is much more expensive. \n(If you want to see the itinerary I did check out my website. It\u2019s my nickname dot com and search for Mexico road trip. There won\u2019t be much info on Belize as I said and also Guatemala was pretty short stay but I did several cities and ruins in Mexico\n\nEdit: talking of most important sites they are pretty even. Belize has Caracol, one of the most important ancient Mayan cities. Guatemala has Tikal, rival to Caracol and also one of the most important. Mexico has clearly chicken itza, and calakmul. But I saw palenque, coba, uxmal, tulum, ek\u2019balam, edzna\u2026all with their unique charm (and lizards\u2026and mosquitoes)",

    "postText": "So I'm going to fly into Copenhagen but want to see the northern lights so am heading to northern Norway soon after. The total trip will be ~11 days. I'm wanting to know if November weather is fine for visiting Norway outside of northern lights viewing or if once I've seen them I should head back south to Denmark and Netherlands for the rest of my trip.\n\nDoes anyone know if going to say Bergen would be worth it for a trip in November? I know daylight starts to really be limited and that's my worry, that I won't have enough time in days to do things if I'm too far north. I do want to do some hiking and such if I go to the Bergen area but if there isn't enough time for stuff like that then I would head back down to Denmark and Norway instead.",

            "comment": "Personally I find November one of the worst times of the year to go travelling in Northern Europe. This applies even more so to solo travelling. It\u2019s usually wet, windy and overcast. There\u2019s a good chance that you might not be able to see the Northern Lights as there are times when it\u2019s cloudy for 1 or 2 weeks straight. If your only goal is to see the Northern Lights in Northern Norway please don\u2019t be disappointed if you don\u2019t actually manage to see them. Also November really isn\u2019t the best time to go hiking, apart from limited daylight hours the weather is usually quite miserable at that time of the year. Bergen, especially, is known for its windy and rainy weather.",

Usually overcast/raining and pretty cold most of the time, so pack accordingly. \nWith that being said, a lot of the danish cities are really pretty when it is dark, and you will encounter very few tourists.\nA thing to know about Danish people is that most of us are really friendly and don't mind talking to tourists. However, we will not be the first to approach. So don't be scared to start conversations:)",

Otherwise I would recommend to focus on Denmark and Norway instead. Adding the Netherlands also means adding a flight or spending 10-20 hours on public transport.",

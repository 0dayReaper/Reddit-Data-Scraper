    "postText": "Hello, fellow solo travellers!\n\nI'm planning to explore Portugal from Porto to Lisbon on a road trip and to go to Spain (Ibiza and Barcelona) and London for a short period of time, and now I'm planning the next two weeks of the trip.\n\nAs a fresh new graduate out of school and a Canadian who knows elementary amounts of French, is native in English, and is conversational in Mandarin, I have no budget and I'm open to any price point, and my time period will be **two weeks,** with my return flight in London.\n\nI'm interested in experiencing a large variety of different things, and I'm extremely open and spontaneous. I'm looking for eye-opening experiences whether that be through cultures, nature, or architecture. That being said, one of my goals is to see as much variety/different cities/cultures as I can in the short period of two weeks. Some things that I've really liked so far are grand views such as castles/mountains, and city views from a distance. I also am interested in a bit of history.\n\nHere's what I've considered so far:\n\n* I would definitely love to see France. I was thinking of just hitting Paris, but perhaps it might be better to visit a smaller town such as Lyon or Marseille? Does anyone have thoughts on this?\n* I've thought about visiting Italy (Rome, Florence) but I wanted to save this for another trip when I'm a bit older so that I can travel the ENTIRETY of Italy from north to south or vice versa. Is this a good idea? or should I just see the big cities?\n* I'm also considering visiting prague/vienna/budapest/krakow/berlin since they are all geographically closer to each other and I am especially interested in Krakow due to the WW2 history.\n* My last consideration is Switzerland through the alps.\n\nIf you have any recommendations or tips on where I should travel next, please share your thoughts and experiences! I would love to hear your suggestions on the best places to visit, things to do, and any hidden gems that I should add to my itinerary.\n\nHappy travels!",

            "comment": "Some observations:\n\n - In general, you want to find a route that efficiently exploits the rail network so you can see the best stuff with the least hassle. So pick either something westerly with e.g. Paris/Rome or something easterly with e.g. Berlin/Budapest.\n\n - Paris is going to be a solid inclusion for many itineraries you would consider, both for the obvious reasons but also because it is one of the most central nodes in Europe's high speed rail network.\n\n - For stunning natural beauty, I would target either the Alps or the Cinque Terre - two of the prettiest areas in Europe, and within easy striking distance from Paris in a week or so.\n\nYou could do an awesome eastern itinerary, but it's going to be a little short on natural beauty relative to what is available in the Alps or on the coast. So here are a few optimized itineraries to give you an idea of what is possible with a westerly route:\n\n - [Amsterdam to Zurich](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=amsterdam$3$r~antwerp$0$e~bruges$2~paris$3~colmar$1~gimmelwald$3$r~bern$2~luzern$0$e~zurich$0$e$r&amp;trans=Mixed&amp;nights=14&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;) with Bruges, Paris, the Alsace, Bern and the Lauterbrunnen Valley. This gives you arguably the best slice of the Alps, it's best city (Bern - with a great \"view from a distance\" viewpoint), medieval half-timbered charm (the Alsace) and overall just a great variety of sights.\n\n - [Paris to Rome with coastal beauty](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=paris$3$r~avignon$2~nice$2~vernazza$2~pisa$0$e~florence$2~rome$3$r&amp;trans=Mixed&amp;nights=14&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;) via Provence, the French Riviera, Cinque Terre, Rome and Florence. This route swaps the mountains for the coast, and the best cities of the north for the best cities of Italy. Can also [swap Rome for Venice](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=paris$3$r~avignon$2~nice$2~vernazza$2~pisa$0$e~florence$2~venice$3$r&amp;trans=Mixed&amp;nights=14&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;)\n\n - [Paris to Rome with Alpine beauty](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=paris$3$r~colmar$1~gimmelwald$2$r~bern$2~milan$1~florence$2~rome$3$r&amp;trans=Mixed&amp;nights=14&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;) keeps Italy, but trades the coast for the Alps. Again, can [swap Rome for Venice](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=paris$3$r~colmar$1~gimmelwald$2$r~bern$2~milan$1~florence$2~venice$3$r&amp;trans=Mixed&amp;nights=14&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;).\n\nI don't think there is any particular reason to 'save' Italy for it's own trip unless it's for learning/practicing a language. It sounds like you want to maximize the diversity of your itinerary, and Italy is perfect for that. I promise that on your next pass through you'll have plenty to do. It would be very easy to build a top-quality 2 week Italy-only itinerary with zero time in Venice, Florence or Rome - and I expect you'll want to revisit one or all of them in the future anyway.",

I went to Spain and Portugal for a month and still didn't see everything.  You can always return to Europe to see another area--and you should!\n\nIf you do want to go city to city then I'd highly suggest you plan it out [looking at the rick steve's train map](https://d3dqioy2sca31t.cloudfront.net/Projects/cms/production/000/004/626/original/b69fa72bb2489338ed33ceb2259db0e2/tips-rail-passes-time-cost.gif).

I flew into amsterdam, planned to go to heaps of different places. \n\nIn hindsite I wish I just flew straight into portugal or spain. Austria is wonderful.  But I'd suggest just picking 1 country, even 1 city to base your self in, and doing day trips out of there.\n\nFrom the places you list, I'd suggest base your self in Vienna. It's a wonderful city and you could easily spend 2 weeks just in Vienna, and certainly just in Austria. From there you can easily make it to Salzburg for a night or two, even eastern germany. \n\nI just wish I'd spent less time at train stations and waiting for check ins at accommodations. Train travel isn't as romantic as you might imagine.",

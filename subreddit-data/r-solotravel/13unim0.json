    "postText": "Help with itinerary\n\nHi guys. \n\nApologies, as this is similar to my last post here. Just wanted a bit of help with the order of things \n\nI\u2019m in Hanoi, stayed here a bit longer than planned and only have ten days left (as of tomorrow) \n\nI plan to go Ninh Binh, Sa Pa and ha long bay. \n\nWhat would be the most logical order to do it in?\n\nI thought Ninh Binh then Sa Pa but my hotel suggested Sa Pa first, Halong bay then Ninh Binh, but they offer service to Sa Pa so I wonder if that is why. \n\nAlso - Halong, anyone have recommended cruises? I understand that it\u2019s best not to skimp on price, but of course, I\u2019d still like to keep it as cheap as I can, whilst getting the quality. So yes I will not skimp but I don\u2019t need to travel like a King. \n\nThanks for help in advance.",

Hanoi bottom left, sapa top left, ha long top right and ninh binh bottom right. \n\nI think the way your hostel suggested seems most logical but the way to decide is looking at transport options via 12goasia.com. \n\nAre you in the Vietnam backpackers WhatsApp group? Lmk if not and I\u2019ll add send you a link, ppl will have detailed advice for ya there.",

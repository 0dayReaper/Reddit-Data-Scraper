    "postText": " I\u2019m going to Boise, Idaho in July for a work trip. After a week of work, I\u2019ll take some vacation days and have \\~7 days of solo traveling before I have to fly back to Europe. It\u2019s my (M, late 20s) first time in the US, but I\u2019ve done a little bit of solo traveling in Europe and Asia before.\n\nIdeally, I would like to experience nature (hiking, mountains, and the like) and/or visit some interesting (large-ish, preferably walkable) cities, but I do realize 7 days isn\u2019t a lot of time, and I might be difficult to properly do both. Right now I\u2019m thinking of two main alternatives:\n\nAlternative 1: Keep it simple and stick to cities. Both Portland and Seattle seem interesting, and are just a short flight away. Maybe 3 days in Portland and then take the train to Seattle for 4 days there, spending my time doing whatever activities I can do within/near the cities. In this case, I would not get a rental car. This I feel like would be the easier option, but would lack in nature experiences. Is it even possible to do that without a car (e.g. take public transportation somewhere and do a day-trip up a small mountain or through a nice forest or something)?\n\nAlternative 2: Rent a car in Boise and get on the road. This could be either east to Yellowstone, Gran Teton and similar national parks and then back to Boise, or west through Oregon and Washington (visiting national parks and similar along the way) and end up in Seattle, from where I would fly back. How does one do this typically? Drive somewhere in the morning, do a day hike, drive to a hotel in the evening (I won\u2019t bring any camping gear)? This seems as an attractive alternative, but I\u2019m not sure. Extra cost of rental car, extra hassle (I\u2019m ok with driving, but it\u2019s an extra layer of stress, especially when solo), and spending a lot of time driving seem to be the downsides.\n\nI realize these are two quite different options, but I can\u2019t decide what to do, what would be most feasible, and what would be most fun. Any opinions?",

I'm sorry to the other commenter but Boise is a boring city ( I once lived there), and if you come from out of the country, nature is why you visit that part of the USA.\n\nYou live in Europe, you have much better walkable cities to visit back home.",

Or get to the campsites early (like 6 am) and drive around til you see people packing up to leave. \n\nKeep your hand on the E-Brake at all times when driving in that area! There are SO many animals (deer, bison etc.) that just stand in the middle of the road, it can be really dangerous to hit them. I'd recommend trying to avoid driving at night for this reason.",

But be aware that hotels and motels near the park entrances can be expensive and are sometimes fully booked. With that said, the town of West Yellowstone, ID is fun. Several good restaurant options and easy to get to and from the park\u2019s west entrance. Day trip into the park, then back to town for dinner. \n\nI don\u2019t know about Portland or Seattle but in Salt Lake City there are buses that can take you up to the ski resorts up the canyons. They run more frequently during ski season but still run in the summer. During summer the ski resorts often have different events like music festivals and will possibly have the gondola lift going as well.",

There\u2019s also a lot of ferries that run throughout the islands that surround Seattle and they\u2019re relatively well priced and can bring you to some beautiful islands. I\u2018m not sure of their walkability though if you don\u2019t have a car.\n\n2) The train from Portland- Seattle is a great option and well priced but nothing compares to European rail service you may definitely run into unforeseen delays as Amtrak operates on freight rail tracks. \n\n3) Portland and Seattle are amazing places to visit but like many other big cities they are experiencing some major homelessness problems. Portland after Covid and the riots is still rebounding slowly but surely but there is absolutely a very large homeless epidemic so keep that in mind.\n\n4) If you go up to Grand Teton and into Yellowstone you will absolutely love it. It will be extremely touristy and make sure to check closures on roads and permit requirements for visitor limits. If you get the chance stop in Jackson, WY it\u2019s a beautiful town and beautiful area overpriced but worth it if you\u2019re there it\u2019s worth the price to go to a nice dinner.\n\n5) One last note portions of that drive will be boring and long but the end result of the drive is worth it by far!\n\n*** Also, about 20 minutes south of Jackson are some great hot springs called Astoria hot springs. There\u2019s even a pull off on the left side of the road going south where you can walk down the hill a bit and it\u2019s completely free.",

It\u2019s beautiful out there and driving in the rural US is as easy as it gets. It will be busy in the nat parks in July though. \n\nOther option is go to Seattle (make sure you research, it\u2019s a lot busier than it used to be and huge variance between nice areas and sketchy areas) and see the northwest. Weather can be perfect in July. Can even take a quick ferry to Victoria on Vancouver island in Canada. \n\nDo not take a flight to Portland and just walk around the city. It\u2019s a wreck from the drug/homeless crisis. Oregon is beautiful, but much better to visit the smaller cities and towns (Bend, Corvallis, Eugene, Salem, etc).",

Go up to Stanley for a few days, rent some camping equipment from REI or Boise State University (research online) and camp in the Boise National Forest.  Or go south west from Boise and stay in the Owyhees. \n\nBoise's downtown is a whole scene, so you'll get a good taste of America there too. \n\nBoisians are amazingly nice - hit up the couch surfing crowd and it's likely you'll find someone that will take you a few local adventures - hot springs or rafting are popular. \n\nDefinitely rent a bike and explore the river while you're there.",

Rainier and Olympic National Parks in Washington. Olympic in particular is massive and has different regions that are hours apart (beaches, forests, mountains). Lots of casual hiking options. And Mt. Rainier is just a beautiful place (I stayed in Packwood when I visited; be aware it can be a long drive into the park, depending on where you\u2019re headed). You could keep a day in Seattle at the beginning and/or end of the trip and still have those couple days to check out the city.",

The hotel prices in Jackson Hole are through the roof. This way you only have to spend 1 night in Jackson hole\n\nThe best parts of Seattle are the nature experiences imo, so I would not go there if you plan to just stick to the city and not rent a car.\n\nYou are way too close to Yellowstone to not go, although in July it can get crowded.

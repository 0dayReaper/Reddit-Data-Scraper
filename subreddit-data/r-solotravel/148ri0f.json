I ended up losing the equivalent of about $80 USD. I\u2019ve been very careful up until now and I just feel like such a dunce and I\u2019m angry and pissed off at myself. It ruined the whole rest of my day and honestly it\u2019s ruined my drive to travel more, even though I have booked all my other hostels and flights. Has anyone had any similar experiences and advice to get over it?",

Walk into a hostel and tell people you got scammed and you'll get a fountain of responses on people who have too. \n\nHell - there are times I KNOW I'm being scammed but you don't really have much choice and need to choose your battles. And sometimes you're just tired or distracted or have your mind elsewhere or just missed it. \n\nIf you put enough mileage out there, it's bound to happen at some point. It's a learning experience and even though it doesn't feel like it now, it's a story in the pocket. The $80 in the grand scheme of things is something you'll forget about with time but the lesson and the story and the experience is something else that'll last longer.",

I found out by a text asking if I was trying to spend $1,500 at a restaurant while I was on the Spanish Steps. I was pissed off and it ruined my day. Luckily I had a spare credit card at the hotel or it would have been worse. Here's the funny thing though. When I talk of my trip I don't always bring up Cordoba, Toledo, the Vatican, or the Bourgese Gallery. I always bring up the stolen wallet though. This very quickly became a great story. Life is more than just good experiences we all have bad ones too. Getting scammed may not be a happy experience but it's a good one for you. Everyone and their mother has stories of \"I went here,\" and \"I saw this thing in that museum,\" but you have an, \"I got scammed for $80\" that is yours. People will be more interested in the scam story than anything else from the trip. Now is the time to be rightfully pissed off but in the grand scheme of things $80.00 is nothing. When was the last time you saw a movie where everything went right? You haven't because they're boring. So go vent to your fellow travelers about that scam and continue on your trip. These are the things that make life memorable.",

Have some really good chocolate to swallow that bitter pill, enjoy the free views and pleasures where you are, to \"make up\" for the lost money.

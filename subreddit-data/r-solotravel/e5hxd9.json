    "postText": "So I broke off from my friends and decided to do a couple days solo in the small towns a couple hours north of Nagoya - buried in the mountains, with autumn leaves, forested mountains, and the snow-covered Japanese Alps lurking off in the distance. For reference, I visited Takayama, Shirakawa-go, and a town from \"Your Name\" Hida City.\n\nAround 10pm in the evening, I arrived at a guesthouse in a town called Takayama. I went to the common area lounge to chill. A Japanese couple traveling from \u014cgaki, Japan (in their mid to late 60s I think) started talking to me saying how they loved meeting foreigners because they wanted to practice English and share Japanese culture.\n\nSince I was a solo traveler, they invited me to visit a village with them the next morning called Shirakawa-go. I had wanted to go since it's a UNESCO World Heritage Village but I didn't think I'd have time. But they offered to drive me there and show me around so I thought why not.\n\nI met them the next morning at 7am sharp! Before venturing to Shirakawa-go, we dropped by the town morning market for fruit and a Japanese bakery for breakfast pastries. When we returned to their car, the woman gifted me her favourite pastry from the bakery and an apple from the morning market and refused to let me pay her for it.\n\nWe also spent a few minutes walking around Takayama's old city streets, which feature classical style Japanese architecture built in the 1600s or so. The streets were relatively empty compared to the chaos it would become later in the day, over-crowded with tourists and selfie sticks. At this hour, it was serene, peaceful, and somewhat nostalgic of a Japan from the distant past.\n\nWe then hopped on the highway and drove to Shirakawa-go. Before entering the town, the couple took photos of me on an amazing overlook showing the mountains, the town, rice farms, and a river. The town itself certainly lived up to the hype; it only has traditional style farmhouses with straw roofs and was so cool to wander around. We stopped for soy sauce rice cakes on a skewer which once again the couple refused to let me pay for.\n\nBut then we took the scenic route on the drive back. This time we saw rivers, lakes, and mountains. We stopped to see some random statues and monuments along the water. The views were incredible. They showed me certain statues and temples along Miboro Lake I would have never discovered on my own.\n\nOnce we were back in town, they took me to their favourite ramen restaurant for lunch, and it was so good I think it changed my life.\n\nThey then invited me to a hot spring with them and I was kinda curious to try it. It's a bathhouse where you go in heated natural spring water and it's really healing. It's a part of Japanese culture and many people go frequently, especially the older generation. Since Japanese hot springs are famous, I thought why not.. All in all, it was an amazing experience, with a view of forest-covered mountains. It was fascinating hearing the couple describe how hot springs pertain to their culture, and it was an honour that they shared it with me.\n\nAfter stopping for some famous Hida beef, they said goodbye and I went on with my day - I went to the next small town on the train line Hida City which felt quaint and historic, but was less touristy and I really enjoyed that - but wow what an experience. I learned a lot, but they were also so incredibly nice. Without even telling me, they bought me an apple from the fruit market, their favourite pastry from the pastry shop, a skewer of soy sauce rice cakes in the UNESCO village, the ticket for the hot spring, and the famous local beef steak on a skewer once we were back in town. They showed me multiple secret spots for amazing views on the way back, took me to their favourite shops and restaurants in two different towns, and this was all before 3pm..\n\nIn contrast... I didn't have anything to offer them besides time, and they seemed to appreciate that very much. They kept saying how they enjoyed practicing English and sharing their culture.\n\nBut still.. that was crazy. I can't believe some people can be so nice to strangers.\n\nAdditionally, I love that this story is testament to how uniquely fulfilling solo travel can be.",

This couple noticed it and struck up a conversation with me about the mountain, how I'd liked Japan, etc in extremely fluent English, and we had a lovely conversation about travel, comparing places we've been in common etc. What really stuck out for me though was that the husband had not only visited the small, rural corner of the UK that I come from, but he actually knew a bunch about the history and folklore of the area, and even knew a few words in my local dialect. To this day I can count on one hand the amount of fellow travelers who have even heard of Devon, and I've sure as fuck never met someone else who knows any Devonian words. Most British people don't even know the dialect exists.\n\nIt was a really striking end to a great trip.",

It served me very well and I really wanted to keep it as a souvenir..  But I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get on my flight home with it.\n\nI held onto it for the rest of my trip (4 more weeks) and when it came time to board my plane home (to Canada) I was able to check it in as an \"oversized\" item.  In Toronto I had to go to a special \"oversized items\" section near the baggage pickup zone to get it.  I was so happy to see it there waiting for me!\n\nSo this shouldn't be a problem",

She was heading in the same direction, so we then walked to the train together and started chatting. Turns out she worked for a travel agency, and was thrilled to learn more about what working for an airline was like, etc. Before she got off at her stop, she told me how many more stops before I needed to get off and we bid our farewells.

They could  barely speak English, but they managed to told me about their homes, their trip (we were in Kyoto, they came alone in a sort of ladies trip from a little town near Fukuoka though). Their efforts and google made my day.\n\n\nJapanese are generally supe kind and polite. These ladies made feel at home for a bit and reminded me we need a little to be happy. Japanese don't ever change, please :)",

You\u2019ve experienced so many things so many times that you start to get more pleasure out of offering new experiences to young and/or inexperienced people than you would from experiencing them by yourself, or even instead of experiencing them yourself. Of course you can still enjoy things when you\u2019re old, but there\u2019s just nothing like the wonder and enthusiasm people have when they\u2019re experiencing something completely new. Also, things like an apple, a pastry, a lift ticket, etc cost what may be a completely trivial amount of money to some (not all, of course) mid-life/older people, so the monetary aspect is a non-issue.     \n\nTLDR: Eventually it becomes more gratifying to give people things than to get things from others, because getting things for yourself becomes boring when you\u2019ve been doing it for a long time and basically already have most things you want or need",

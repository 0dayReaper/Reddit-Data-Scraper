    "postText": "Hi there, I'm a Malaysian. I would like to travel from Beijing to Moscow via Land. Trans Siberian is a dream for most travelers. I've checked many sites regarding the route. Is it true that the route is temporarily suspended for international due to some issues happening recently? If it is then is there any other alternative route to take on the Trans Siberian Railway if I am coming via Beijing, China?",

When you can do the trip, book your ticket in stages, as it's not a flexible get on/get off ticket like in Europe.",

I'm from the UK and wouldn't be allowed access to Russia but many countries have remained on good terms and still have visa agreements for Russians coming to there country and for others to go to there's. I have no idea about a Malaysian passport but I think a lot of south East Asian countries can still travel to Russia. I would check with the embassy in Malaysia.",

Better to wait a few years.\n\nAs others mentioned, Russia is currently at war with Ukraine and indirectly with Europe and Nato. I did the railway around 2017 and even then there were protests against their goverment. From what i've seen, the situation now is far and far worse.",

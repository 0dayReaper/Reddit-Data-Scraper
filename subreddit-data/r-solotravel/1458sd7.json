    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nIm a 26 yo/male and I'm going to Bangkok for 3 nights in August. Basically, my goal for the trip is:\n\n**During the day:** Smoke weed, get massages, go sight-see, eat good food and join some of the hostel day trips like Mad Monkey Chatuchak Market Outing (any other day trip recommendations are welcome)\n\n**At night:** Party and meet people to just simply have a good time around town with and make some unforgettable memories.\n\nI initially was going to stay at one of the hostels like Mad Monkey, Bed Station or NapPark for the convenience of easily meeting people BUT after reading some other posts it seems as staying at a hostel is not necessary in Thailand to join in on the hostel fun. Therefore, I'm now considering just booking a room at D&amp;D on Khao San Road for the convivence of having my own room in case I want to bring any girl back or actually get some decent sleep and then just popping into the hostels for the party.\n\n*Questions:*\n\n**1.** Will not staying in a hostel make it harder to make strong relationships with other travelers, even if I visit the hostels for the party? Good sleep would be nice, but I'll sleep when I die, so if it gets in the way of making good friends, I rather sacrifice the comfortable sleep.\n\n**2.** I'm only there for a short time, do you have any recommendations on any activities to join and meet people faster? Organized tours for people in their twenties thing like that.\n\n**3.** What are the must visit places for an unforgettable time in Bangkok?\n\n**4.** Should I stick with Khao San Road or go more for Soi Cowboy or Nana Plaza?\n\nThanks in advance you crazy beautiful people.",

If you\u2019re staying alone you\u2019ll often be getting home on your own, often late, probably drunk and in a city you don\u2019t really know. At the hostel you\u2019re either out with people who are going back to the same place, or you\u2019re partying at the hostel anyway.    \n   \nGo check out Never Not High for weed. The guys in there were great and it was the best quality I got from a shopfront.",

I'm only there for a short time, do you have any recommendations on any activities to join and meet people faster? Organized tours for people in their twenties thing like that.**\n\nPlenty of such tours around. Street food, history, art - whatever floats your boat. You meet all sorts of people on all sorts of tours, so it'll help if you can narrow in on your other interests a little more.\n\n**3. What are the must visit places for an unforgettable time in Bangkok?**\n\nI found Khaosan quite seedy, TBH, and much preferred the bars and clubs of Sathorn and Sukhumvit instead. Some incredible rooftop bars around the city. Also, the temples and palaces are very pretty - do have a look. Loved the street life in Chinatown too - excellent food there. Travelling by river- or canal-ferry is fun as well. Also loved the Jim Thompson House - excellent place to get some quiet time when the city gets too frenetic.\n\n**4. Should I stick with Khao San Road or go more for Soi Cowboy or Nana Plaza?**\n\nKhaosan has its fans, but I'm not one of them. As I said before, I found the place too seedy - too many touts - and unbearably loud. Besides, you'll have to use buses or cabs to get around from there. Soi Cowboy and Nana have access to BTS and MRT, which will let you explore the city in air conditioning, without having to worry about taxi fares or traffic jams, while keeping you close enough to the action.",

We'll keep this post stickied and everyone is encouraged to keep sending their messages to OP. Sorry OP, hopefully another mod can keep open it up again soon.\n\n- - - \n\nI'm reopening this thread by request of OP. We will be monitoring this thread very carefully. Please refrain from reacting hurtful comments. \n\nThe description from the Imgur link:\n\n&gt;Sunday Sept. 10- Adeolu left his hostel (Hostel Azul) in Granada and went to Laguna De Apoyo\n~11:30am- He rented a kayak from the Paradiso Hostel and kayaked across the laguna\n~2pm- A fisherman saw him on the opposite side, supposedly headed back across the laguna\n~4:30pm- Another fisherman found the kayak pulled up on the shore and resting on it's side\n~8pm- The police arrived after Adeolu was reported missing and searched the laguna\n\n&gt;Monday Sept. 11- My family was notified by the US Embassy in Nicaragua that Adeolu was missing\n\n&gt;Monday/Tuesday- Someone thought he saw Adeolu in Granada but he's not too sure\n\n&gt;Wednesday Sept. 13- The two fisherman were found and their stories recorded; The kayak was retrieved and there were no signs of damages or trauma\n\n&gt;Tuesday Oct. 10- It's been a month now. The Nicaraguan police, army/navy, fire rescue, manera, and the amazing staff of the resorts on the Laguna have searched everyday.\nThey have dived everywhere they could in the laguna\nTraversed the perimeter and the diameter of the basin\nAnd walked around the perimeter of the basin\n\n&gt;There has been no sign of Adeolu.",

The first thing that came to mind was drowning because I had a scare of my own there. In any case, I'm glad to hear that the authorities are cooperating in searching the laguna. Your brother seems like a great human being and I truly hope that you find him safe and well. I will talk about this with my girlfriend in the morning to see if she can share this with her friends that are still down there in Masaya. \n\nEdit: Shit, I realized Paradiso is the same damn place we stayed at too :( The people there are great though so Im sure youre getting all the help you need; however, if you need ANYTHING translated into Spanish Im fluent so please let me know.\n",

It has a coverage area that includes a large portion of the planet, with the exception of extreme northern and southern latitudes and parts of the Pacific Ocean. SPOT is simplex and cannot receive user data.\n\nWith the purchase of a basic (annual) subscription, SPOT allows short (41 character) user-defined text messages to be sent to a list of telephone and e-mail addresses.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/solotravel/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27",

It is possible that communications in the area could\u2019ve been down and he was unable to contact anyone until he\u2019d moved on. Find out if he was using public transportation or a private service.  He would\u2019ve stuck out so see if you can get in contact with the local PD as well.

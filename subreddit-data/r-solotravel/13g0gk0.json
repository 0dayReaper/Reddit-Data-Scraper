    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019ll be on a 6 week trip this summer, part of which I\u2019ll be in Italy; \n\nRome for 5 nights, \nFlorence for 3 nights (until June 21st), \nMilan for 2 nights (25th-26th for a show) \n\nAny suggestions where to spend time between Florence and Milan? Something nature-y would be nice after Rome/Florence. Perhaps Como? Perhaps just extend Florence? \n\nI\u2019m sure Rome and Florence will be extremely busy, so if there\u2019s any slightly more relaxing spots anyone may know of, I\u2019d appreciate your thoughts! \n\nJust want to gather some spots to brainstorm\n\nEdit: also I\u2019ve been wondering on Bologna - I feel like I would enjoy it. Perhaps extend Florence to 4 nights, and doing 3 nights in Bologna?",

Parma is a nice day trip close to Milan. I may be in the minority, but I didn\u2019t like Florence all that much. It was crowded and the food was just ok.",

Around 1130 at night when I decided to come back here after visiting the same morning at around 7. \n\nIn the morning, the shrine was full of people coming here before work and some others walking their dogs.\n\nAt night, it was so beautifully lit up and there were such few people around. \n\nCamera: OnePlus 5T",

I don't fair well in places with high population densities, so I've been putting off visiting Tokyo, but I may reconsider if it's possible to see cool things like temples at night without too many people... cool photo! :)",

It's also possible to find cheap hotels in less popular areas if you don't mind commuting.\n\nThis might be common sense, but I learned that before booking it's worth to plan a route on gmaps from the hotel to the nearest major station you'll most likely use every day. If it's too much hassle to get there by public transport, book somewhere else, because while you might be willing to do it now, you won't want to do it at the end of a long day when you're tired as shit.\n\nCapsule hotels or hostels aren't for me and I wanted to be close to the station, so I went for this option even if it was more expensive.

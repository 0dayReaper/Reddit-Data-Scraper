    "postText": "Hi, I'm in the process of planning a budget-friendly trip through South Europe using an Interrail pass. I will start by flying to Barcelona and then traveling by train along the following route: Marseille, Rome, Florence, Venice, Ljubljana, and Split. After that, I plan to continue my journey through the Balkan countries by bus, and in some cases, I might try hitchhiking to reach certain destinations.\n\nWhile sorting out the transportation aspect, I've encountered a bigger challenge: finding affordable and convenient sleeping arrangements. Traditional options like hotels and motels are beyond my budget, and carrying a tent throughout Europe isn't the most ideal solution (it might what will happen). Although couchsurfing used to be an option, it appears to be less active nowadays. I require accommodation for about one to three days each place I stay. Another consideration was purchasing a car and sleeping in the back, but unfortunately, my current budget doesn't allow for that. Purchasing a more reliable vehicle would increase my expenses significantly. Perhaps having a travel partner to split the costs would make it more affordable. Moreover, the thought of being behind the wheel for the entire trip is not appealing to me.\n\nAs a result, I've been considering the idea of sleeping in public spaces with just a mat and a sleeping bag. Alternatively, I may end up combining some of these options. Nevertheless, I'm curious if you have any knowledge of alternatives or suggestions for ensuring sufficient sleep while staying in multiple cities in this region. Your insights would be greatly appreciated!\n\nConcept of the trip: [https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1ppFhvulBHcTG1EWavQSrFd7c3uuX1lI&amp;usp=sharing](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1ppFhvulBHcTG1EWavQSrFd7c3uuX1lI&amp;usp=sharing)",

For example, the Interrail Global Pass offers discounts for people under 28 and Balkan Flexi Pass if you are under 26. I have been thinking about this trip for some time, and this offer has now become my motivation to embark on a Eurotrip in the next few years. It would be wise to take this opportunity while it is discounted rather than miss out on it.",

There are some FaceBook groups for hosting, see if you could find some. Hostels should be affordable and I think people occassionally ask if they could do some light housekeeping, reception or bar shifts in exchange for free accommodation. Use nightbuses or trains and sleep onboard if you're able to, could save you a few nights. There are options, some harder to come across and some maybe not as safe as others so please do proper research. And probably not the best idea to sleep outside as that's just not safe nor comfortable. Hope you have a good time!",

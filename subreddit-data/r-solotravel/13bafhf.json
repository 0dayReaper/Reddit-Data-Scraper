    "postText": "Has anyone ever gone to a concert at the Salzburg Festival (or something similar) alone? I just booked a ticket for a Vienna Philharmonic concert...this is part of two weeks of solo travel in Europe this summer. I think there's a lot of touristy stuff that is commonly done alone and doing them alone is pretty normal....but I feel pretty awkward even thinking about going to the concert by myself \ud83d\ude02 (Obviously I didn't let that stop me)",

I've been to festivals solo before but they're metal festivals so they have a very different vibe (or at least I expect so, maybe someone will start a mosh pit to Dvorak).",

You have to go online, and pick out the concerts you would like to attend, and they send you an email with the concerts that are available. If you want to see Jedermann, you gotta be fast. The performances sell out quick!!! There isn't really a place that sells \"leftover\" tickets, or single tickets for performances. Go to [https://www.salzburgerfestspiele.at/karteninformation](https://www.salzburgerfestspiele.at/karteninformation) for more information. If you get the tickets, enjoy it!! Dress appropriately too!! You don't need a fancy Ballgown, but they do like to dress up there!",

And I absolutely plan to wear an evening gown, it's part of the experience!   \n\n\nI'm so jealous that you live in Vienna! I will be spending a few days there, and then hitting up Salzburg on the way back to Germany.",

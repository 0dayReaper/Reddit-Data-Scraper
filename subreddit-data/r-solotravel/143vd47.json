    "postText": "Hey, so I\u2019m taking a solo trip to Rome in December for seven days. I started planning a little bit, but I haven\u2019t paid for anything beyond just the plane ticket. \n\nHere is what I\u2019m thinking of doing:\n\nStay in Rome for three days. Take a train to Naples for a day and then the next day dedicate it to Pompeii. Then I\u2019ll go back to Rome for my last two days and fly out from there back to the states.\n\nWhat I\u2019m asking for help on is what should I do? What should I see? Where should I stay? Best places to eat? Maybe a cooking class? Is my plan realistic?\n\nMy budget is about $1000 give or take for the trip. I\u2019m flexible and again I\u2019ve already bought the plane ticket so that\u2019s half the battle.\n\nI\u2019m a big history buff which is why I definitely have to see Pompeii, but I also love the arts and I think seeing an opera may be fun.\n\nThere is just so much information on this that I\u2019m drowning in it and it\u2019s making it hard to come up with an itinerary. So I thank you for any help that you can offer. Also, I\u2019m sure that this will be helpful, but I\u2019m a female solo traveler. Would it be in my best interest to find some other female solo travelers in that area in the same time that I\u2019ll be there? If so, how do I find them?",

            "comment": "I would definitely recommend staying in Trastevere instead of the city centre. Personally, I felt the places near the city centre were like places that were past its glory. It was dirty and felt unsafe at times. \nAlthough Trastevere is a bit far from the centre, the place is amazing and there is a lot of bus stops and train stations you can utilise to travel to the main attractions. The transport system is not top notch, but still you can rely on Gmap for the stops, not for the time. Trastevere is more peaceful and calm. I stayed at the place for 2 days it is one of my most cherished memories of the trip.",

            "comment": "Here's what I learned from my own Rome/Naples trip last September:\n\nFor both cities an app called Guruwalk proved very useful in finding \"free\" (a.k.a. tip-based) walking tours.\n\nThe entry fees for museums and historical sights in Italy are very expensive and really add up if you visit several sights per day. So pick carefully which ones you're really interested in. Don't feel like you're missing out too much if there's something you can't visit from the inside. There's so much to see it'll start giving you diminishing returns at some point anyway.\n\nBook your train ticket to and from Naples as far in advance as you can. There's a limited number of cheaper tickets and when they are sold out, it gets more expensive. That goes for both of the long distance train companies that service that route - Trenitalia and Italo Treno. You can check both online and pick the one that's cheaper.\n\nThere's an app called Trenit that shows schedule information from a variety of train companies. It's not that useful in the Naples area, because it's missing a couple of important lines, esp. the Circumvesuviana, which you'll need to get to Pompeii. However, it warned me of an impending strike when I was there and saved me from wasting an entire day. So I recommend it.\n\nPublic transport in Naples requires Zen levels of patience. The (local) trains and subways run on a schedule only known to God (Google Maps thinks it knows, but it's wrong) and buses always get stuck in the everpresent traffic jam. So getting around will take ages. Since you only got 1.5 days in the city, make Pompeii and maybe one highlight in Naples your only real itinerary points and assume you won't have time for other activities after getting stuck in traffic. For your daytripping needs, an accomodation close to the main station would be convenient, but the area directly around the main station is one of the grimiest, smelliest and most unsafe-feeling in all of Naples, so you might want to pick something a bit further away after all.",

So it shouldn\u2019t be hard to pick one thing to see or just enjoy the day walking around the city and see where the day takes me. I\u2019ll definitely look into the apps that you mentioned and the train tickets will be purchased very soon. Thank you for the tips.",

Ideally, pick a hostel that's somewhat close to the main train station or at least a metro station that connects to the main station. \n\nThe weekly public transport pass in Rome is cheap (only 25 euros), so I recommend getting that as well. And it's valid for a large area. You can go as far as the coast and Ostia with it (that used to be Rome's harbour in antiquity and is also an interesting sightseeing destination).\n\nYou can book tours and stuff like cooking classes or even a mosaic workshop on tripadvisor btw. \n\nHave fun!",

    "postText": "Hi, when I was planning a solo trip this past year I stumbled on a pretty simple website that aggregated google reviews by count and users could search by distance. \n\nThis was incredibly helpful when looking at things to do in a new city and figure out top rated activities while also avoiding popular tourist traps. \n\nI used it for a few cities and kept it as an open tab for a long time but forgot to bookmark it. I can remember it being a mostly yellow background, has anyone stumbled on this website or something similar?",

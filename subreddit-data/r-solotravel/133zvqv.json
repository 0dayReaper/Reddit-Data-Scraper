    "postText": "Hi all! So I'm going to Peru and Brazil for about a month, leaving next week. While I'm traveling, I'll need to be applying for jobs back home and the easiest way to do that is on my laptop (since writing cover letters and sending emails is difficult on my phone). \n\nIt's my first time traveling to South America, and I'm a little worried as a woman traveling alone. Should I worry about bringing my laptop or will it be safe if I generally keep it locked in my hostel? Thank you:)",

Make sure on buses to keep your belongings literally on your person if possible.\n\nI enjoyed a lovely nap while my backpack was sitting in the storage shelf above my head.\n\nWhen I got off the bus my laptop was no longer in my backpack, sad day.\n\nSo yeah just be cautious of your belongings in public.",

Once you have a phone or wallet, it's easy to pocket or handoff to someone. If you've got a camera with expensive glass, you have to run away with it.\n\nThe only actual incident I had in South America was an attempted cell phone theft that would have looked like comedy skit to anyone watching.",

Ive been in Mexico and Brazil so AFAIK there can be worse areas in these countries than Peru. \n\nI am a male, so that does help, but looking organized and not appearing wealthy will take you far further than your gender will. \n\nOnce you're in your apartment/hotel things are almost always fine. Furthermore, if you don't need to have a bag (luggage or backpack) with you, then don't. Theives see more potential value in a person with bags than they do with one who is only carrying a good attitude.\n\n Cheers, good luck.",

Pickpocketing and snatching are the main concern, so as long your backpack is in your front you will do fine (some skechier neighborhoods are exceptions, better research about each city so you know where to avoid. For example, around Central Train station in Rio is rough). Mugging usually happens when its dark, so I take ubers when I have expensive stuff with me at night.\n\nIt was never necessary to me, but in bigger cities its quite common to see people using their laptops in cafes.",

Nevertheless, bringing your laptop can be useful if you need to work or have other crucial tasks to finish while you are traveling. Be sure to keep your laptop secure while traveling because it's crucial to think about the security of your possessions. Make sure to check whether there are electrical outlets and Wi-Fi in the locations you will be visiting.",

Also I carried in in a pacsafe bag with two locks on the bag. I used it for doing work and watching movies when I stayed in at night. No tactics are guaranteed to prevent theft, but you can also get insurance. Although it doesn\u2019t fix losing what is stored\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fif it\u2019s stolen.\nGood luck!",

Hold your backpack on your lap when at a bus or other public transport. Do not go into dark alleys or walk on empty streets alone at night. I have never been robbed but I know how things are here. It's not super dangerous, but always be careful. It also depends on where you're going. The south region is fairly safe. S\u00e3o Paulo and specially Rio de Janeiro are more dangerous.",

I spent 3 months in Brazil last winter and our hostel in Pipa was robbed. Someone climbed over the fence and got into the dorm that was the closest to the fence and stole 2 iPhones and a laptop that were left charging openly on top of beds while people were in the dinning area having dinner. \n\nAlso never have your iPhone out in your hand while in Brazil. Never. I saw iPhones being ripped out of people hands in broad daylight in Rio and Salvador. In Salvador an iPhone was stolen from the hands of a Brazilian girl right in front of the police car and the police did nothing. They didn\u2019t even flinch when the robber ran away. \n\nI loved Brazil but man.. that was for sure the most dangerous country I\u2019ve been to and I could never got relaxed there, spent all of 3 months being constantly on high alert. Didn\u2019t get anything stolen from me though, unlike some more relaxed and carefree people i met there.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am planning to go to Mexico from the 15th of August to 10 September. I will be using some credit card points to get cheaper tickets. I know for sure I will leave either on the 9th or 10th September from Cancun because the ticket is really cheap so I know where my journey will end!\n\nMy problem is that I don't know where to start exactly.\nI've seen a couple of itineraries on reddit and online. But can't decide between starting at Guadalajara or Guanajuato?\n\nA brief overview of my plan if I start from Guadalajara:\n\nGuadalajara - 3 days\n\nGuanajuato - 4 days or maybe with 1 day in San Miguel de Allende? Heard they were similar so not sure if I should skip!\n\nSantiago de Quer\u00e9taro - 3 days (heard it's a really nice place) OR Puebla\n\nMexico city - 6 days(going to go to teotihuacan for sure)\n\nPuebla - 3 days OR Santiago de Quer\u00e9taro\n\nOaxaca - 4 days\n\nMerida - 4 days (want to see a cenote, go to cancun from there for my flight)\n\nNow that I wrote my itinerary, it seems a lot for 25 days... Among these cities are there some that are really similar so I don't need to see them both? Or maybe you know another must see city? Was thinking of travelling with buses or train between cities, but for longer distances probably use plane.\n\nI like to see different architecture, old ruins, eat great food, just walk around markets, maybe visit a museum or 2 because I know it's going to be hot as hell! I'm planning to stay in hostels too, and maybe hotels/airbnbs if I find some really cheap.\n\nDo you guys have any other recommendation or must do activities in Mexico? I don't drink. I would like to spend like a whole day on a nice beach on my last day of the trip to relax after an active trip, maybe at Holbox? or Isla Mujeres?\n\nThis is just an overall outline of my itinerary, it's mainly to decide where I start! I know that there's a volcano situation in Mexico too, so need to monitor the situation! And it's also rainy season and really hot so need to be well prepared.\n\nAny tips or recommendations will be appreciated! I'm gonna research more for safety too, I know that some places can be dangerous.",

            "comment": "Quer\u00e9taro and Puebla are very similar.  Guanajuato is amazing.  I would add more time in Merida.  Look up Celestun,Uxmal, Beccal,Pregresso, etc.  All are an easy day trip from Merida.  Then, plan on a night or two on site at Chichen Itza on your way to Cancun.  One of the better hotels there is actually on site and allows extended hours to the ruins.\n\nMy next adventure is to Oaxaca City so I'm not knocking the city but it is pretty out of the way considering the rest of your itinerary.  Maybe schedule it for your next trip?",

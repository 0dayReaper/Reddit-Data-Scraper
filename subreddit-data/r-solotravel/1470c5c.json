    "postText": "I'm planning to do a 2 week roundtrip to 5-6 french cities with Interrail this year. I'm torn whether I should do it in July or around Oktober/November.\n\nI'm not very interested in hiking or going on the beach - my focus is more on discovering the cities, society and culture and meeting interesting people.\n\nIn July there is obviously much better weather but there are also way more tourists about and the prices for hostels seem to be crazy (e.g. Marseille for a random period in July there are just 4 hostels on hostelworld and the prices start at 45\u20ac; if I put in October the prices go down to around 30\u20ac-40\u20ac and for November there are some for as 25\u20ac).\n\nSo my question to all who have some experience with traveling in france:\nIs it worth paying this premium to visit France during the summertime?",

            "comment": "October will give you a much more pleasant and genuine experience. Some of the of the more fun activities will have closed after the summer but the cities will still be fun. Paris is always busy no matter when you go.\n\nA big tip however would be to highly flexible with you plans (which you can be in off season). The weather at that time of year can be nice or horrible, however France is a large country so you can always jump on a train North or South. Keep an eye on some weather apps and plan accordingly.",

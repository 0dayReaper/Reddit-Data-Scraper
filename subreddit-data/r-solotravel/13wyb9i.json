I've been traveling for 6 months, and been living this lifestyle off an on for \\~10 years, so I've been through the ups and downs, but -ah - this one sucks.\n\nI had the option to go back home to my family, or go celebrate with my friends in my main hub, but I want to keep moving and pushing forward with my 'plan'. Going back home for just another birthday feels like a step backwards. I missed a wedding and tons of other stuff this week. But that's the sacrifice. I feel like I'd be upset if I turned around. \n\nI've made a couple friends where I'm at, but I'm always a bit disconnected so it feels weird celebrating. I'm also going through a breakup and we had the same birthday, so it kicks extra hard.  \n\n\nI'm going to go to a spa tomorrow and go shopping to buy some nice stuff. Maybe go to dinner, or for a drive. And then move on and forget it. ",

I played tennis for like 4 hours (with people who didn't know it was my bday), then wandered around Paris and had dinner. For me it was a good day. But I hate when people ask about what did I do to celebrate and then they pity you for not having done anything special. \nAnyway, if you're happy doing a solo birthday then there is nothing wrong with that.",

I sat at the bar, and met another solo traveler next to me who ended up making my birthday more special than I ever imagined. We talked for hours, connecting on so many levels, we shared plates (and laughs and tears), she bought me a birthday dessert and sang to me. I never did see her again or keep in contact, but it is a memory I\u2019ll hold on to forever. \n\nOP, choose to celebrate your birthday doing something you\u2019ll enjoy.

I decided to go solo, and some people I met at the bar made it an incredibly special day. They sang happy birthday to me at midnight and bought me drinks and okinawa snacks. Plus I got to travel to all these places that I wanted to go to at my own pace, and do exactly what I wanted to. I wanted to spend everyday at the beach, some very popular and easy to get to where I socialized, and some that were isolated that took an hour bus and an hour of walking through the Okinawan countryside to get to. It's dissapointing at first, but changing your outlook and putting yourself in situations where you know you'll enjoy yourself will make all the difference",

            "comment": "Happy Birthday! Seeing this too late to matter, but i spent my birthday this year alone at a retreat and my present to myself was not to speak to a soul all day lol. I also did all my favorite things available to me - took a yoga class, did a hike, got a massage, and curled up with a book. It was HEAVEN. I made the day all about celebrating me. And whatever you ended up doing, I hope you did the same.",

            "comment": "Happy birthday! I hope the spa-shopping-dinner-drive sequence cheers you up a bit. I'm inclined to say that you shouldn't be so hard on yourself - going back home for a quick birthday celebration isn't a step back - you've been travelling long term as per plan for a while now, I doubt you have much left to prove. However, you know your priorities best, and as long as you can look back at this and feel it was a good thing to have pulled through the blues, great!\n\nJust to add some perspective - I got widowed young. Ever since, I've travelled a lot solo. It does feel lonely at times, especially when you realise you don't have anyone around you to share a great moment with. But I also live with a socially packed calendar, and many times feel stifled by the obligations and appearances that can entail. In that context, solo travel feels like a pressure release of sorts, and gives me the window to 'let my hair down' (so as to speak, I'm still a homebody). It was my birthday the weekend before last (21st of May). I travelled to South Africa solo for it, and was so glad I did. At home, I'd have had to play good host. There, I did whatever I felt like doing - long bath, some sightseeing, good food and drink, and lots of napping. I didn't even have to answer a hundred phone calls to mechanically say 'Thank You!' to each one. I'm thinking of making it a tradition now. :)",

Ended up talking to friends and family all day and then had a fancy dinner and went clubbing with a bunch of friends I made at the place I\u2019m staying, who are now good friends. Really memorable day and a nice symbol of where I\u2019m at in life.\n\nAlso I missed quite a bit of detail that I just spent 2 months at home in Europe taking care of my dad after he was hospitalized and need to be back again in 4 months. So it really would be cutting into things. \n\nBirthdays are weird and for me a time of reflection. I learnt a lot. Thanks for sharing your stories!",

    "postText": "So I'm currently in the middle of a month long solo trip around Europe, but i don't know where to go for my last week. I've just finished a few days in Spain, hiking around marseille, and a week in Italy. I'm flying to Athens today, and going hiking in the Albanian alps for a week after that. But I'm having a hard time deciding where to go for my last stop.\n\nThis trip is my first time traveling alone and my first trip to Europe, so I've been a little unsure of the best way to do things. Ideally I'd love to finish this trip somewhere in the mountains with a lot of day hikes. I'm not equiped for overnight hikes. But I'm having a hard time figuring out how to navigate day hikes with public transportation. Anyone got any recommendations for great hikes accessible by bus or train? Prefer more affordable countries so maybe not the dolomites, but maybe Slovenia or something? Anyone done any cool hikes that they would recommend? Thanks!",

Heck, you could walk right out of city centre into the mountains without the need for a bus or tram/train. \n\nSlovenia's a bit cheaper and has some decent hikes as well. It's a small country, everything's accessible by public transport.",

I can't remember the names of the hikes, but I've went ahead and Googled a bit and found this helpful:\n\nhttps://www.moonhoneytravel.com/best-salzburg-hikes-austria/\n\nI think it might contain one or two walks that Ive done. \n\nEither way, Salzburg as a city itself is very safe and has a lot of stuff to see and do. I had a bit of a 'student city' feeling, but not in a bad way at all, in fact, in a great way. It was cool to see students all over the place involved in social and/or sport activities.\n\n1 'must': try Kaiserschmarrn! After a long, good hike, it's THE food to refuel.",

Groceries - with the exception of meat - tends to be actually reasonably close (though sure marginally higher on some products) than nearby countries. \n\nHotels and accommodation also tend to be quite reasonable (and less dramatically impacted by seasonal shifts). \n\nIf you're mostly hiking and can make your own food, it's actually pretty reasonable.",

There are so many options. You can do easy or you can do harder, or you can do very easy.\n\nNot sure if you'd want to go to NL, but if you want super easy (and are walked out by the end of your trip), the Netherlands is the way to go. They have a whole program of walks you can do from station to station. (Use Chrome to translate to EN) [https://www.ns.nl/dagje-uit/wandelen](https://www.ns.nl/dagje-uit/wandelen)   \nWe did Slovenia two years ago, but had a car. I think it's doable by public transport. Luxembourg, specifically the Mullerthal Region is beautiful and well connected. We've done the following by public transport: Tromso, Norway; Lucerne, Switzerland; Killarney, Ireland; multiple parts of Germany (we went to Fussen/New Schwanstein last year, but have done the Romantic Road before). We also did the Canary Islands, but booked cars to drop us off at trail heads, which requires more time than you have.   \nTransylvania is also doable by train; that's next on our list.

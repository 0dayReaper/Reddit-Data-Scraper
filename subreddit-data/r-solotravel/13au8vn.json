    "postText": "Hello. I am traveling to South Africa for the first time and will first arrive in Johannesburg. I plan to visit the Kruger National Park, and have done lots of reading. My itinerary is as below:\n\n\\--\n\n**Mon**\n\nCheck-in Skukuza Bungalow\n\n16:30 - 21:30 Sunset Drive (If I make it on time)\n\n**Tue**\n\n05:00 - 08:00 Sunrise Drive\n\n15:30 - 18:00 Afternoon Walk\n\n20:00 - 22:00 Night Drive\n\n**Wed**\n\nCheck-out Skukuza Bungalow\n\n\\--\n\nThe biggest problem here is the transport from Johannesburg to Kruger National Park.\n\nFlying is from Johannesburg to Skukuza airport is too expensive, so is renting a car and drive alone for few hours from Johannesburg to Kruger National Park. \n\nI have checked buses like Intercape, Translux and Greyhound, but after reading reviews only they appear to be unreliable, always delay and breakdown.\n\nI wonder if there's any reliable to Kruger National Park from Johannesburg? I have searched for few days and have not found any good resources. Recommendations are much appreciated!\n\nNote: I will be taking guided game drive in the camp itself, so I am not renting any car.",

I remember when I went, they organized pickup by bus and then jeep transfer, as the roads got rougher leading into the park. \n\nAlso not sure how set in stone your itinerary is, but I would strongly suggest adding another day or two for the safari. I took a 5 day one, and some days were definitely quieter than others in terms of wildlife. \n\nHave such a great time!!",

Basically I intend to book the skukuza bungalow accommodation, then add the game drives, which means I would join a group of fellow travelers. \n\nMy problem now is, how to get to Johannesburg to Skukuza rest camp?\n\nOh yes, I think I should add a few more days in Kruger. But does that mean I go on multiple sunset, sunrise drives?",

            "comment": "You have two options. Drive from Johannesburg to Kruger directly or take a flight to one of the small airports around the border of the park. My advice would be to fly to Nelspruit airport and from there get to Skuzuka through either the Paul Kruger gate or even better, the Phabeni gate.\n\nPersonally I went with a rental car from Johannesburg to Kruger as we wanted to do the Panorama Route on our way to the national park.\n\nThe journey from Nelspruit to Phabeni gate is around 1h15 to 1h30 min and the road should be OK, in case you decide to take a rental car.\n\nI did a simulation of renting a car in Nelspruit and the cost is around 20-25\u20ac per day, this gives you a bit more of flexibility as you can take the car into the park and you can drive your own whenever you want (following the rules, ofc, I still recommend that you have at least one guided drive per day). I did a self-drive myself and it was one of the best experience of my life.\n\nAnd as a fellow poster said, definitely extend your safari for a couple days if you can manage to do it.",

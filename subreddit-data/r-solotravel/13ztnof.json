    "postText": "Earlier today, I was on a regional train from Munich to Prague with a first class seat. I was also in one of my melancholic moods and two hours of snooze-ridden sleep the night before had me feeling grumpier than usual. Needless to say, I was happy to have the entire compartment to myself. \n\nJust when I was counting my blessings, a middle-aged German man and his three young kids aged - I'm guessing - 6, 8, and 10 entered the compartment. I took a deep breath and said hello and then continued looking out the window. The 6 year old took the seat opposite mine and started coloring a horse on the table. The man said to me that if she starts to bother me to let him know. I said, \"no problem\" but didn't smile. I exchanged a few glances with the little girl opposite me from time to time but never asked her her name. \n\nAbout 15 minutes passed this way. All the kids were busy with some activity and the man was encouraging them and correcting them in a fatherly way. I found it quite touching really. But I kept looking out the window, serious, grumpy, and tired. The man informed me out of the blue that they were going to get off soon. This made me feel a bit awkward. Why did he volunteer that information? I just nodded. Eventually they left the compartment. The man said the words, \"we'll be leaving you now.\" I thought the phrasing was a bit odd, but I just robotically responded \"have a nice day\" to which he didn't respond. \n\nLater on in the journey, I had to go to the bathroom. On the way, I passed a compartment with a ragtag group of people just standing around socializing. Some were sitting on benches with no back support. Some had beers in their hands. I guessed maybe these were the people without first class tickets. I'm still not sure. But what surprised me was to see the man and his three kids sitting there. The kids were busy with their activities and the dad was looking over their shoulders. The 6 year old was coloring on her lap instead of the table the first class compartment offered. I avoided making eye contact with them. My mind was racing now: why are they sitting here instead of first class? Was it on my account? The next stop was still far away. They could've easily remained in the compartment.\n\n---\n\nThe rest of the journey went by in a flash. A Scottish gentlemen entered my compartment. He was a solo traveler too and in his 60s I suspect. We had a lot of common interests and I lapped up all his tales from the British army and other travel adventures. But the episode with the man and his kids kept nagging me. Somehow, I felt like I'd driven them away with my melancholic energy. And this made me feel incredibly guilty.\n\n---\n\nI reached Prague, caught up on my sleep, exercised, took a nice long shower. And then it hit me, an epiphany of sorts. One of the great things about solo travel is that I get to live on my own terms. I don't have to compromise for anyone. I can go where I want, when I want. And in the same spirit, I can talk when I feel like it and stay quite when I feel like it. \n\nToday, I realized this mentality is flawed. \n\nYes, solo travel offers a lot of freedom. But at the end of the day, I am still a guest in someone else's country. And that comes with some responsibilities. Responsibilities like being friendly with the locals. Responsibilities like trying to understand the local language and culture. These people are doing me a _favor_ by letting me live in their country for a few days. I shouldn\u2019t take it for granted.\n\nI\u2019m ashamed of my behavior in the train today. I will never know why they left the compartment, whether it was because of me or something else. But that\u2019s not important. If I had to re-live that experience, I would\u2019ve behave differently. I would\u2019ve asked the kids their names, their summer plans, and complimented the girl on her coloring. And just smiled. It\u2019s not rocket science. The circumstances demanded it of me. Who know, maybe it would\u2019ve even made _me_ feel better. But my fiercely independent and individualistic nature blinded me.\n\nBut enough looking backwards. In Prague, I plan to redeem myself. I just returned from a night stroll during which I approached a local man who was waiting for a tram. I spoke in Czech. I asked him if he\u2019s Czech. He said yes. Then I looked him directly in the eye and after a few halting starts and broken attempts, I said, \u201cd\u011bkuji, \u017ee m\u011b m\u00e1\u0161 ve sv\u00e9 zemi\u201d which translates to  \u201cthank you for having me in your country.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t overly emotive but he understood. His eyes grew moist and he kept eye contact. Then I bid him goodbye.",

            "comment": "Dude, you are hella overthinking this. There is absolutely no expectation of some random guy chatting up a 6 year old on train, especially in Germany. The super standard default in a public space is always saying nothing. Hell, many (most?) German parents probably wouldn't even feel comfortable with you doing so. A lot of people, myself included don't even really know how to talk to a 6 year old. And there's nothing wrong with being sleep-deprived on a train and not wanting to be around a bunch of children. Maybe the Dad could sense that and felt bad for taking up the compartment you previously had all to yourself and decided to go somewhere else, just being considerate to you. But who cares why? You did absolutely nothing wrong. Take it easy on yourself!\n\nAnd if you want to go around telling random people on the street \"Thanks for having me in your country\" that's fine and all, but do be aware most people aren't gonna be filled with gratitude or pride, they're just gonna think you're kinda weird.",

He'd have maybe done the same for another person sitting in your place, or maybe not. \n\nAnd it's not like you made a scene or unfriendly remarks either. What if you were sleeping? You wouldn't have smiled either way, and the guy maybe would have gone for a move all the same, with you none the wiser.\n\nJust let it be and count your blessings.",

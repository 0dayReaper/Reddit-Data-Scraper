    "postText": "Hi.  Perhaps this is a better post for one of the psychology threads. Regardless, I thought I'd ask here.\n\nQ1:  In planning a trip, booking flights, etc. do you ever experience incredible hesitation and guilt in spending your money on travel? \n\nEven if you got an incredible deal on flights, are staying in a place that costs 10 usd a night, ... you still have a panic about spending $2 - 4k usd on trip?\n\nQ2:  If you feel this guilt, Why?\n\nQ3: How do you resolve that guilt and/or change your plans?  How do you either spend or not spend your money and have fun?!\n\nIn a nutshell, my business is going well and I want to plan a trip for 7 - 10 days duration.  I have been considering either Peru &amp;/or Ecuador with a layover in Bogota. Of course, I don't want to overplan as both Ecuador &amp; Peru have so much to see &amp; do.  Really now is the best time for me to make a trip like this. I've put it off for years. Years past I did not have the money and then I did, but there was the virus.  I don't have children or a spouse to worry about. I'm healthy. \n\nThe problem I have is that I look at flights and what I'd like to do in that time and think the following:  \n\n\"with the price of flights &amp; connections, this is too expensive $$ of a trip.\"\n\n \"7 - 10 days is not enough Time to fly to Lima then fly to Cusco or Iguitos, then back to Lima then to Bogota then home.\"\n\n  \"I'm Solo and won't really have fun spending so much time &amp; money and flying so much. I'll be very worried.\"\n\n\"Maybe I'll just go someplace national I've never been to save $$.\"\n\nI think I just need to CBT write myself out of this. 'Fear Setting' is some kind of exercise that may help.  .\n\nAny input or advice is helpful. Thanks.",

Skip that coffee at Starbucks for a month? Travel fund. Clip coupons to save on groceries? Travel fund. You get the idea.\n\nAt first, it started off very modest. But I've been doing this for more than 20 years and have amassed a healthy amount in the travel fund over the years. \n\nAnd now, whenever I travel, I spend money that already exists in the travel fund, totally guilt-free and without the stress of wondering whether I'm short-changing other aspects of my life.

A summer clothing haul, a new video game coming out, a nice bike, ordering Uber Eats instead of cooking, etc. To me, travel is just like all of those things spending-wise.

            "comment": "Yes, sometimes I feel guilty. But not for the reason you may think. \n\nI\u2019m single, in my 40s, and comfortable financially. What that means to me is I\u2019m hitting my budget goals and feel confident I can afford what I\u2019ve prioritized. We all value different things so my version of \u201ctoo much\u201d spent for travel likely isn\u2019t helpful. \n\nI feel guilty because I know I\u2019m doing something so many people can\u2019t afford. Like they are making tough choices in the grocery store, putting something back. I have family who are eking out the last of savings after a job loss. I live in a city where homelessness and addiction is very much in your face right now. And I think about going away this month and feel a mix of guilt and gratitude that I have the option. \n\nHow I deal with this is to remind myself of a few things:\n1. I share my finances through planned giving. \n2. It is a good thing that I work hard and budget. \n3. Even hard workers can fall on hard times. I\u2019m grateful for those that taught me to plan ahead and have an emergency fund. \n4. I\u2019ve been through a lot of hard times. It is ok then to enjoy when it\u2019s my turn at the good times. \n\nI hope you find that sweet spot where you can take care of your future AND live for today doing what you love.",

If you can afford to pay your bills regularly and aren\u2019t in debt, there\u2019s nothing wrong with spending money on what makes you happy. Like so many people have said, life is short. And you never know what\u2019s around the corner. You could live for another 50 years, but you can get sick tomorrow. If traveling is something you want to do, figure out a way to do it. \n\nI was like you, though, still am in some ways. Pre-pandemic I always found great deals on international flights and I know I saved a lot of money when I made those deals work. I like to stay in places that are clean and comfortable, but are not five star resorts. For activities, I pick things that appeal to me and not just what the guidebook says you must do. So I know over the years, I saved a ton of money traveling the way that I do. But still, last fall, I went back to Australia with others, and because of the state of travel, flights and lodging were ridiculously expensive. I almost backed out because it just seemed ludicrous that a trip like this would cost more than I\u2019ve ever paid. And then the pre-pandemic days, I could probably get 2 to 3 trips out of what I paid for this one. But, in the end, I told myself through my planning I saved tons of money, and just like buying gas, sometimes you buy gas when it\u2019s really cheap and other times you buy it when it\u2019s super expensive, but it balances out. I don\u2019t spend a ton of money on other vices like going out to eat all the time, drinking, sporting events, going to concerts, nightclubs, etc., so I give myself permission to spend money on things that bring me joy\u2026 And travel is it. \n\nLike I said, I still do struggle, sometimes with following my own advice\u2026 I have time off this summer, and really want to go somewhere, but looking at prices, I\u2019m aghast. But in the end, I\u2019ll probably find somewhere to go. \n\nI feel as though I\u2019m a better person for it in so many ways. And they also recognize that one day, circumstances may keep me from traveling, whatever they may be\u2026 so I may as well take advantage of the opportunity that I have today. \n\nIf you want to go, by all means, don\u2019t stress. Have a great time planning and enjoy your trip!",

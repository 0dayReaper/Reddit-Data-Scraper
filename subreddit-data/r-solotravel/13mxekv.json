    "postText": "31m here. Misdemeanor DUI (7 years ago), Misdemeanor Public intox charge (4 years ago). No jail time ever, have since cleaned up my act. Was quite a degenerate back in the day. But what are my odds for being deemed criminally rehabilitated with the information above? I\u2019m planning a trip to Vancouver (go Canucks!) in January of 24\u2019. The process for entering Canada as an American with a minor criminal record seems to be an MASSIVE headache. I\u2019ve done some research online but I would like to hear first hand if anyone has experience on this subject? Thanks in advance.",

I\u2019m overwhelmed with so many options. I\u2019m looking more for easy eats, like petiscos as opposed to a nice fancy restaurant. \n\nI had a very delicious bifana the other day, perhaps something like that!",

Great fishes, good wine.\n\nThere is also a great Nepalese restaurant in Gracia called RD's that was delicious and not too pricy. It's similar to Indian food but with a little kick.\n\nIf you don't  want to go all the way to Bel\u00e9m, just grab pasteis de nata from Manteigaria, it's delicious and there is no line.\n\nAnd if you're feeling slightly more fancy, our 2 favorites were Taberna Sal Grosso  (Portuguese petiscoes, but far from traditional, it's phenomenal) and Nossa Casa, which was our favorite restaurant, bar none. It'll set you back around 50 Euros including wine but it's definitely worth it.",

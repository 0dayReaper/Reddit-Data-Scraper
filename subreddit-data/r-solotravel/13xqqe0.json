    "postText": "Hello, currently slowing traveling through Eastern Europe but found a cheap flight to Malaga so gonna keep traveling. \n\nI\u2019m 20M and generally looking to explore lots of the two countries while having time to relax after the current long solo venture I\u2019ve been on (started in Latvia and finishing in Croatia, around 9 countries in 33 days) I like to keep moving on pretty quick but I\u2019ll probably spend a good portion of my time in Lisbon. I would love to see Madrid and Barcelona as I like to experience the local culture of each, but prices and time are a bit out of my budget for this last minute planning that is unusual for me. \n\nThinking about Malaga&gt;Granada&gt;Cordoba&gt;Seville&gt;\nSomewhere in the south of Portugal (Lagos, etc, not too sure where to go, suggestions would be greatly appreciated!) &gt;Lisbon&gt;Sintra&gt;Coimbra&gt;Porto and fly out\n\nIf anyone could steer me in the right direction or anything I\u2019m overlooking for anyone who has done something similar that would be great.\n\nFor info: I generally want to chill at beaches some, chill in cities some, drink good wine and eat good food (meats and cheeses) for cheap if possible. And not spend more than 2/3 days anywhere besides Lisbon. I usually don\u2019t spend this much time in a country or two at once, so it\u2019s a bit overwhelming ha. Thanks in advance!",

To each their own, and certainly hope and expect you're going to have an amazing trip, but make sure you're smelling the roses. On that note, as someone else mentioned, Sevilla is amazing, and Madrid needs more than a day/half day.",

I\u2019ve had a damn blast this trip and met dozens and dozens of people and good times max seen great stuff, certainly have slowed down now after exhausting every part of me haha, which is why I\u2019m not too worried about being in a place like Barcelona atm. I think I\u2019ll check out Madrid for a few days though. Definitely gonna spend a lot of time in Lisbon and maybe a few in Porto too.",

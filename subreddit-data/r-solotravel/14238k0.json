    "postText": "I have been solo travelling around south east Asia for 3.5 months now. I met some people in Vietnam who became fast friends and we organised to go to Malaysia together. Now we are here I have come down with dengue fever and I have spent 2 days in hospital with another one day to go (hopefully). Then I have two more weeks left in Malaysia with friends, then three weeks by myself and then I\u2019m meeting some university friends for the final four weeks in Indonesia. \n\nEven before arriving in Malaysia from Thailand I was feeling a little burned out and from my hospital bed have been googling flights home (and then back as I really don\u2019t want to let my friends down). I feel the need to rest and stay in the same place for a week or more once I leave my friends but I am not sure if I can achieve this feeling myself. I was looking at spending a week on the Gili islands and establishing a routine and resting. I have never been very good at resting and it has felt like long travel has always cancelled out my rests anyway. \n\nHow do you manage to properly rest? Should I accept that it might be worth calling time and going home instead after 4 months?",

            "comment": "Speaking from experience, dengue is quite a debilitating illness, and it leaves incredible fatigue in the long-term. I'd advise you to rest SINCERELY for a few days after discharge, and then figure whether you have the energy to travel home or continue your travels. Please don't wait for your friends to leave before you start resting - a health relapse will be even worse to deal with. They'll understand - it's not as if you deliberately fell sick. Please stay somewhere close to a medical facility for now - KL or Penang perhaps. Believe me, you don't want to be back in the hospital struggling with platelets transfusions.",

                    "comment": "I second this as well based on personal experience with dengue on the prolonged fatigue it leaves you which can be really crippling. It's indeed prudent to stay close to a medical facility for IV drips and blood tests, given that your platelets would dip (critical risk) quite suddenly depending on your body's constitution. I would suggest a full month of proper rest and just taking it easy would be recommended if possible",

Don't put any expectations on yourself and you won't be disappointed. Good luck, my friend. Get well soon.",

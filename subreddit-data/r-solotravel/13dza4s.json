    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm (27M) putting together my itinerary for my travel in June. This will be my first time doing a solo travel trip abroad. I haven't had a vacation in years and want to take a break from work to reset (I'm self-employed).\n\nI haven't put together an exact list of what I want to do in each location yet, but think that I should first book my travel + hostels and then put together a rough list of what I can do in each location to keep the options open.\n\nOpen to any thoughts/critiques/etc. I think I'm leaving enough room in each city based on what I've read on this forum and others.\n\n Sunday 6/11 - Fly to Rome\n\nDay 1 - Monday 6/12 Land in Rome Day 1\n\nDay 2 - Tuesday 6/13 - Rome Day 2\n\nDay 3 - Wednesday 6/14 Rome Day 3\n\nDay 4 - Thursday 6/15 Rome Day 4\n\nDay 5 - Friday 6/16 Rome Day 5 - Leave for Florence\n\nDay 6 - Saturday 6/17 Florence\n\nDay 7 - Sunday 6/18 Florence\n\nDay 8 - Monday 6/19 Florence, leave for Cinque Terre\n\nDay 9 - Tuesday 6/20 Cinque Terre\n\nDay 10 - Wednesday 6/21 Cinque Terre leave for Venice\n\nDay 11 - Thursday 6/22 Venice\n\nDay 12 - Friday 6/23 Venice, leave for Milan (have heard mixed reviews on Milan, catching up with a friend I met during a study abroad years ago)\n\nDay 13 - Saturday 6/24 Milan\n\nDay 14 - Sunday 6/25 Milan\n\nDay 15 - Monday 6/26 Milan, leave for Paris by train\n\nDay 16 - Tuesday 6/27 Paris\n\nDay 17 - Wednesday 6/28 Paris\n\nDay 18 - Thursday 6/29 Paris - fly back to US",

            "comment": "Fantastic rough itinerary. A couple notes:\n\n1. Cinque Terre should ideally get a third night (so two full days). \n\n2. I believe there is no longer a night train from Milan to Paris, so you are looking at a ~7.5 hr train journey that mostly burns a day. \n\nHere is [18 nights from Rome to Paris](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=rome$3$r~vernazza$3$r~pisa$0$e~florence$2$r~venice$2~milan$1$r~bern$2~colmar$2~paris$3$r&amp;trans=Mixed&amp;nights=18&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;start=6/11/2023&amp;end=6/29/2023&amp;) from an optimizer with some potential tweaks, namely:\n\n - Move a night into the Cinque Terre, and swap order with Florence. Not a big deal, but Vernazza-&gt;Venice is around 5.5 hours, which would be nice to avoid.\n\n - Consider a few hours in Pisa enroute to Florence (you'll be passing through the train station anyway, easy luggage lockers).\n\n - Break up the trip from Milan to Paris with stops in Bern (or even the Lauterbrunnen Valley) and France's Alsace - Colmar and Strasbourg make nice overnights. Make Milan or the Alsace a 1 night stop to accommodate these additions.",

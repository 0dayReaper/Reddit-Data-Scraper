    "postText": "I've seen about a million threads on this today, and I am honestly getting sick of seeing this. \n\nThings are moving very, very fast in Europe. Countries are shutting there borders off to other Europeans with freedom of movement rights - let alone foreigners. Airports are shutting. There's currently a lot of foreigners in Poland stuck there because the airports are all shut and they can't leave the country. Every single day there is another country going into lockdown, more travel restrictions announced. \n\nThis is not normal. I've lived in Europe my entire life, nothing like this has ever happened here before. We've had squabbles amongst ourselves, sure - but never shutting borders like this, or lockdowns. This is an abnormal situation that is getting worse and worse quite quickly, and honestly, kind of terrifying for those of us living there. \n\nSo I'm really getting fed up of seeing \"What to do? All the tourist attractions are shut.\"\n\nHere's what you do - Go home. Stop assuming that you will continue to be able to leave the country simply because you have a foreign passport, or that your country will simply repatriate you easily and quickly. And beyond that - your wanderlust is not worth your lives, or ours, or the lives of those in your own country that you could pass the virus onto when you travel home. \n\nAny other time, I'd encourage you to visit Europe, and to visit my country. I love this place. But now is not the time.\n\nEdit - As someone on here has reminded me, when you travel home, please self-isolate yourself for 14 days, particularly if you have been to an affected area. \n\nTheres also been a few people stuck, worried about getting home. If you are stuck abroad due to a travel ban/borders shutting/ airports shutting, contact your  countries embassy where you are and ask for help returning back home.",

What sickens me more than people asking if it\u2019s OK to travel and if there\u2019s stuff to do, is the people responding \u201cbe careful and sanitary\u201d because this isn\u2019t something you can just avoid unless you never leave your house which is going to be the norm for a while if not already. Ignoring the fact that they won\u2019t even be able to make it home eventually like OP is saying, they\u2019re simply just being ignorant and putting others lives at risk",

Done properly, to where you will ACTUALLY protect yourself from the virus, is very labor intensive, regardless of if it\u2019s for work or leisure. \n\nI had a realization. I WILL make a mistake. Even at the rate I and others like me are going. You will too. Yesterday evening, I decided to self quarantine myself. Not because I may have gotten sick. But because I\u2019m tired of living in fear of my health. \n\nI shut my doors and stayed home. I don\u2019t have to burn the infuriatingly limited supply of disinfecting wipes wiping this surface and that. I don\u2019t have to scrub my hands for the ENTIRE 20 seconds. I don\u2019t have to live in fear that I may touch my face and risk scarring my lungs. \n\nThe freedom from the extensive scientifically backed sanitary precautions is doing wonders for my psyche. I\u2019m not in constant fear of contaminating myself or others. I can actually relax. \n\nYou will either enjoy your time traveling fully, or you will protect yourself PROPERLY while traveling. You will not do both. One of these two will creep in. Save your health, save your money, save your wanderlust. This virus will eventually fade into memory. Go home. Stay clean. Stay safe.",

If you have plans as far out as August, a lot can happen between now and then. We aren't going to stop the spread of this virus, but we can certainly slow the spread and flatten the curve via the strategies we are already seeing implemented.\n\nCOVID is still going to be around in August, and long after it. But will borders still be closed, with travel bans and mass quarantines also in effect at that time? We really don't know. It's very possible that restrictions will be loosened up by then and people will open travel between countries without risk of being quarantined or stuck somewhere due to a ban. People can do what they want with their travel plans, and if they're uncomfortable they don't have to go through with anything, but I personally wouldn't scrap anything this soon.",

On Sunday authorities were sent to disperse people at beaches, malls, and other heavily populated areas. Failure to follow the gov't measures can result in 6 month to 2 year jail time. \n\nGuatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama also shut their borders. It's a matter of time before Belize (no cases) and Costa Rica (2nd most cases in C.A.) shut theirs too.\n\nOur healthcare system would collapse if an unmanaged outbreak were to go off. In Honduras experts say we can probably treat 100 patients (population 9million), nationwide we only have 12 working respirators. There will be triage and patients with severe cases will be left to die. I can't imagine countries that are worse off, just don't travel.",

All of the tickets were $2000+, and all of them had a layover in London which were all cancelled. I decided to leave Italy as soon as possible and go to Paris (and I was so so lucky that I booked this flight at the exact day and time I did because all of the other ones were cancelled from there on out). Then I found myself stuck here with nowhere to go. I was finally able to reach my airline for my original ticket at the airport, and I was embarrassingly crying in front of her. I think she took pity on me because she easily changed my return flight for my original ticket (against the airline's rules) and didn't charge me a single penny! My flight leaves on Tuesday, but who knows if it will get cancelled, because I've already encountered a bunch of people from my country who need to go home but keep getting their flights cancelled.

I'm a white collar worker living in Amsterdam, bit of my experience\n\n\n*Two weeks ago*\n\n\nMy company (well, mother company) started advising people to work from home if possible. This wasn't really heeded by my office (it does affect productivity) and wasn't taken seriously until last Thursday. All large social company gatherings were also cancelled. A lot of companies started cancelling ski trips and such, but also friday drinks.\n\n*A week ago(?)*\n\nBasically all public life in one of our provinces was shut down I think (Edit: not really shut down, people just listened to advice and worked from home and didn't really go out).. Didn't affect me, not sure when it happened. Sounds a bit stupid but there's been a lot of news.\n\n*Last week*\n\nStocks sucked. Big dips, fml. Worries started in my firm about the economy and future work, this intensified on Thursday.\n\n*Thursday*\n\nThe government closed all events &gt;100. That's when hoarding started. Empty pasta shelves and no toilet paper. Annoying but no real worries on my part. So from thursday on concerts closed, museums closed, cinema, lecture halls, etc. Nothing very shocking for the average working citizen, you just had less things to do.\n\nTalk got more serious though. While there were more jokes in the past weeks there was now a turning point. Shit's going to go down, and it was no matter an \"if\" but a \"when.\".\n\n*Friday*\n\nFriday I worked from home. Went to the supermarket, made a nice dinner, played board games with housemates.\n\n\n*Saturday* \n\nSaturday I went to a quiet cafe (yeah silly, I didn't feel great about it but I had a date...). \n\n*Sunday*\n\nJust two hours ago the government announced that an hour later all restaurants, bars, sports clubs etc would be closed. We had lines at the coffeeshops to quickly score some last minute weed. All schools would be closed as well.\n\nNow shit's serious. No public life for three weeks. We can still go out of the house so for the most part it'll feel like working from home for a week, but the evenings and weekends will just be sitting at home as well.",

The lockdowns and changes in lifestyle are frightening, but those changes are what are going to protect us and get us through this issue.\n\nI recommend you lock down as much as you can, get in a routine of only leaviong your place when necessary.  Figure out what you need to do that.  Yes you will need to leave periodically to get food.  What else are you going to need?  Don't overstock, but make sure you can wash your clothes and open canned goods etc.  Stop eating out and eating at home, do you need any more cooking supplies?  Cleaning supplies?  Get a stock of 2-4 weeks up ibuprofen or aspirin, but don't buy up everything so others can stock up.  \n\nPersonally I am more optimistic about Canada's response than the US's, the leaders are paying attention to experts and putting the nations interests before politics.  Canada is also improving its testing program sooner.  But it is still undertested and things are going to get difficult.  The best you can do is focus on bunkering down, self-isolating as much as you can while preparing to self-isolate moreso for months.\n\n(I started self-isolating Wednesday after going out dancing Tuesday.  It felt weird I went first, over the next few days all the dance clubs started announcing they were going to shutdown.  Today finally the government (Argentina) announced they're closing schools and they are also not allowing non-resident foreigners to enter).  I was freaked out Wednesday.  Today I feel better, I'm more prepared and the government is making changes and well some people are making changes.\n\nSome people are still going out socializing (I can see a bar across the street from me) but all my friends I've spoken to are social distancing.",

I heard about \"some virus\" in passing but I thought people were panicking over nothing. I overheard some people talking at my university saying they had just been back from Carneval in Venice and that nobody tested them at either airport and nobody got tested unless they showed symptoms. I think the first time I thought it might be something bigger was when they quarantined entire towns in northern Italy. That's when some cases started appearing in the Netherlands. Everything really blew up on Thursday morning. A huge Uni event was canceled the day before, then an hour later all classes were canceled but the buildings would be open, then another hour later they closed the whole Uni saying things would reopen in April-ish. \n\nAs of now pretty much everyone works from home and everyone is told to practice social distancing. Public transport is still running and you can still walk around but there is hardly anyone around. All museums, restaurants, clubs, etc. are closed. Grocery stores are still getting stuff regularly but it's hard to find things like pasta, cleaning supplies, and papers. As the cases start to tick up I would expect it to get a lot more restrictive like Italy and Spain though.\n\nA few of my international friends went home. I'm from the US originally but it doesn't seem like it will be much better there. I heard there isn't even a test widely available. I'm renting a studio until at least August, I have all the food/supplies I need, and there is still schoolwork to be done so I'm staying.",

                    "comment": "I'm in the UK. So -\n\nFirst of all we didnt pay it much mind. Killer flu in China. Didnt think it would be much of a problem here. We repatriated people from China and quarantined them but didnt think much of it. \n\nThen cases started to come here. Got told to put ourselves into self-isolation if we'd been to an affected country, or been in contact with someone who had covid. Still didnt think much of it, was just the flu still. Got told to work from home if you could (I'm currently doing so). Most people I spoke to knew of it still weren't really concerned. \n\nThen about a week ago, Italy announces it's going on lockdown. First just the Northern regions - so the people there try to leave those regions so that they dont get stuck in those areas, even if they live there. Then it's the entire country. We start hearing reports of what's going on in the Italian hospitals - we dont have enough ventilators, we're having to choose who lives and who dies. Were not assessing anyone over 65 or with a chronic health condition, they'll die. Stroke patients are going untreated, everything that is not treating coronavirus has been cancelled, pretty much. This is Italy, a country with a fairly good healthcare system. Not a third world country. That really shook people, they started to panic. Now people are really thinking \"this isnt just the flu, this is serious\". \n\nSo here at the moment, we have people panic buying groceries. At the store today, there was no pasta, rice, noodles, toliet paper, canned tomatoes, UHT milk, baked beans, soup...anything not perishable. Its been like this for the entire week. Shelves are empty. It's insane. I've seen nothing like it. People are also desperate for hand sanitizer. That's completely out. Theres reports of people taking bottles from hospitals. \n\nTransport is currently running, but a lot of things are empty. For example, the usually busy London underground station at Leicester Square (the theatre district) was completely empty Friday night. \n\nPeople are panicked. The people who were not initially - including myself - are now worried. A lot of the people I've spoken to are just staying indoors as much as they can. Several people I know were planning on travelling back to there families for Easter, who are now not going to be doing so because they do not want to be on a train. Events have been cancelled - mass gatherings are banned in some parts of the UK and in several parts of Europe. This means no football matches, no concerts, no shows. Universities are beginning to shut, or do there lectures online. We have local elections coming up in a few places - those have been postponed due to covid. \n\nAt least one airline has gone bust here due to lack of travelling as a result of covid (Flybe). It was already struggling but this has pushed it over the edge. More will follow as less and less people travel. \n\nEconomically - were taking a pounding. Were pretty much resigned to the fact that were about to enter a recession. \n\nWe're not currently in lockdown, schools are open, not shut the borders and no travel restrictions from the UK government, etc etc. But I think we will be very, very soon. Theres likely to be more extreme measures here this week, such as school closures. What's surprising is that a lot of people are calling for that to happen. They're panicked.",

Swine flu affected an estimated 15% of the world population (!!) and killed an estimated 200-300k (with some estimates going as high as 500k). It spread to literally every country. Nothing was shut down. \n\nThe only thing different this time is that there's something \"new\" that hasn't quite been seen before. Pandemics are nothing new at all though and are bound to happen regularly, further exacerbated by overpopulation and climate change, both of which are not considered issues by the very people who now descend into utter hysteria. \n\nI get the need to try to contain, sure. Within reason. But a lot of this is precisely due to inadequate healthcare - South Korea has managed to contain it all fairly fast with no lockdown simply by testing those who came in contact with others who had the virus and isolating them quickly instead of throwing the entire country into standstill to overshadow broken healthcare provision. Which in turn is a political issue. \n\nFurther, barely anyone mentions that Italy has a lot of cases because the North has an overall very old population (a few days ago it was reported that the average age of people in Italy who died a corona-related death was 81 - arguably an age where death is likely, corona or not, and where a bad cold or medium flu would have probably had the same outcome). It's also barely reported that the North of Italy is one of the most polluted areas in all of Europe (a hugely contributing factor in China too of course) or that all of Italy has less than 25% of emergency beds compared to Germany, despite its population being 75% that of Germany.\n\nNot to mention that mass hysteria now leads to everyone who sneezes once rush to the emergency room, thereby taking away time that could be dedicated to those who need it. Don't even get me started on stockpiling at the expense of the very groups who need goods the most - the elderly, who now find raided supermarkets because healthy 35-year olds felt the need to buy 3 months' worth of groceries as if this was the apocalypse. This brings out the very worst in humanity and I'm shocked and horrified and saddened by this more than I am about the virus.\n\nMass media surely hasn't helped, but instead made it a hundred times worse. A live ticker for every death of every citizen? What for? In my country there's been some 15 deaths, all of which were people who were elderly and/or had pre-existing conditions and/or died of something else while coincidentally also having corona. That's blatant adding fuel to fire and creating a level of mass panic that is unnecessary, the consequences of which will be many times worse too.\n\nHowever, no I wouldn't travel to Europe either right now (I'm European trying to get out of the US atm though)",

This is excluding supermarkets, pharmacies, and hair salons strangely enough... \n\nOnce this happened, the reality that things were very serious set in. I'm a nervous person by nature, but I felt that I was sort of in my element during this time of global anxiety (kind of like everyone was now on my playing field). Come Saturday morning, my calmness quickly shifted into a sense of panic that many of you will likely feel in the coming days. \n\nAs an American who loves BBC podcasts, the New York Times, and watching Spanish news with my wife, there is a high degree of variance on the reporting of this pandemic. England seems unusually chill, the States don't know what the fuck to do, and Spain is saying, \"Joder... Deberiamos haber escuchado a Italia\".\n\nI am the \" black sheep\" In a family of successful doctors (which just means I work in tech). They're hardly ever concerned about medical issues unless they are of the utmost severity; I've had a clavicle broken in two places and they've told me to take an ibuprofen and get over it. \n\nAt this current moment with the virus spreading, they're highly concerned. \n\n\nMy parents are colleagues with a respectable epidemiologist who wrote a 15 page analysis that suggests we are still probably several weeks away from THIS SEASON'S peak virus spread. \n\nWhat does this mean? \n\nIt means life is going to change for a while. The luxuries of travel that we've been so privileged to have will be (and rightfully should be) put on pause. \n\nTraveling is the last thing we should be thinking about right now. I'm a mostly healthy thirty-year-old male and I could definitely fly from Spain to California. I won't because it is our responsibility to pull all the plugs and stop this disease. \n\nWe all know someone who needs this virus curtailed. Whether it's someone in your family , your neighbor down the street, or the grandmother across the country, let's do the right thing and care for each other. \n\nDon't fly anywhere unless you have to. Stay at home and love from a distance. \n\nWash your hands.",

You likely don't have a car to bring back stockpiles of groceries, possibly no fridge in the room, and stores are probably empty like in the US I would assume.\n\nI have enough groceries here (in the US) for another 3-4 weeks, and I'm still concerned I won't be able to restock later this month. Even on Amazon Fresh/Whole Foods delivery, half the things seem to be sold out. Never tried grocery delivery, maybe it will work. Certainly selection will be suboptimal.\n\nWe don't know if the lockdown will last for 3 weeks or 8 weeks.\n\nEspecially with the scenes of airports, crowds of thousands of people standing within a foot of each other for hours at customs control. I arrived at O'Hara end of February (where the nightmarish pictures are being taken) and it was a disaster trying to get through customs even then.\n\nMost people on this sub seem to be very lean travelers: save up $3k and go spend 2 months abroad somehow.

Managed to get out of Poland just before shut down as well, then got flights from Berlin to Edinburgh and Edinburgh to Ireland. Rang our embassy immediately when we learned the Slovakian border was closing and their advice was basically 'get the FUCK home.' Cost an arm and a leg and was hugely stressful but if was the right thing to do. There's no way of knowing when the borders will open up again.",

If you are in a country with coronavirus cases and you can still travel to your country, and if you can afford to quarantine just stay there until the spreading is contained. \n\nI know it is hard, I know it seems crazy, but they closed borders for a reason. It is people traveling who spread this, people coming home from China to Italy who brought it to Europe. People traveling to Italy who got the first cases to Madrid... then things got out of xonttol and they closed universities and businesses before forbidding to travel by land BOOM, thousands od infected people travelled back home to the rest of Spain, infectating all the country.\n\nIt's the time to act bravely and stop being selfish. If you are in a country with social securirty (most of Europe I think) even if you don't have health insurance you'll be fine. They will take care of you if something happens.\n\nPlease just avoid crowds and people and quarintine yourself for a while if you can afford it, or ask for help to be able to afford it. Ask for help in the country you are in and they will be able (and eager to) help you. If they won't it's because it's one of the few countries that did not realised themselves this is a global fight and we have to act firmly now. But you are an open minded traveler and you are intelligent, right? So please, please, rememver you can pass the virus before having symtomphs and don't bring yourself infected to a new place, or home to your family.\n\nKeep safe and strong, travel community. I know you'll do the right thing.",

That's totally insane here; nobody would have thought that this could ever happen.\nAlso, just look at Webcams in European cities; last Friday night, there was nobody to be seen at the Fontana di Trevi in Rome; a friday night, in Italy! You know what that means.",

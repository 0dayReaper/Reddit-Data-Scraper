    "postText": "Just got back from my second international solo trip in Spain. I've been to Europe and Spain (Valencia) previously, although this was my first time in these particular parts of the country. My itinerary was as follows: Madrid 05/20-05/23, Granada 05/23-05/26, Seville 05/26-06/01. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome background info about the trip:\n\n\\- I am a mid 20s white male from the US\n\n\\- I stayed in a mix of hotels, hostels, and airbnb, but mostly hostels. \n\n\\- I flew Iberia economy overnight. The aisles were a bit narrow, but they provided decent meals and there were no delays or problems.\n\n\\- While I obviously tried to save money where I could, I have a full time job and was lucky to be in a position where I could splurge on some things where I wanted and didn't have to worry too much about limiting certain activities or meals, which was very freeing.\n\n\\- I know some people like to book their destinations and accommodations on the go, but I knew where I wanted to go and didn't want any unpleasant surprises so I booked all my transportation and accommodations ahead of time. The only attraction I booked in advance was the Alhambra and a tour of the Caminito Del Rey.\n\n\\- I am somewhat conversational in Spanish so I can answer simple questions and order food, but I still struggled quite a bit more than I expected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 1 Madrid: Arrived in the city, took a taxi to my hotel, and checked in. I then went to the Parque del Retiro and Prado Museum (booked ahead of time to avoid lines). I went for lunch after but struggled a bit due to not understanding the language or food culture. I eventually figured it out though, and spent the rest of the days taking a nap, getting some toiletries, hitting up a market with food stalls, and then trying to get to bed early to sleep off the jet lag (although I struggled to fall asleep due to the aforementioned nap).\n\nDay 2 Madrid: Moved my stuff from the hotel to a hostel (wanted to meet people and not spend too much money). I grabbed some churros in Malasana (delicious) and went to the Templo de Debod (it was okay, not worth the wait IMO). The line was longer than expected, so I skipped the royal palace due to time and saw the cathedral. I then checked in to my hostel, got a fantastic lunch of morcilla in La Latina, spent some time on the hostel's rooftop terrace, which seemed a bit more local than hostel traveller oriented. The hostel had a sangria making workshop followed by a pub crawl, which was quite fun and well attended, so I got to hang out with some cool people.\n\nDay 3 Madrid/Toledo: My third day I decided to do a day trip to Toledo. While I don't regret it, I definitely gave myself too much time there, my train left at 10am, so I had to leave the pub crawl earlier than I wanted and didn't sleep much. Despite that Toledo was very beautiful, the cathedral was stunning and there were many really scenic lookouts and winding streets to get lost in. Unfortunately, since it was Monday many places were closed and I ran out of steam by the end of the day so spent a few hours reading in a park before heading back around 7pm. When I got back to Madrid, I went out with some people at the hostel for dinner and some drinks, and went to bed. \n\nDay 4 Madrid/Granada: My last day in Madrid I was still slightly sleep deprived/jet lagged. I took it easy in the morning and got some breakfast at my hostel before chillin on the balcony at the Corte Ingles down the street. I grabbed a burrito for lunch and one my hostelmates split an uber to the train station with me. I took the Ave train from Madrid to Granada, it was quiet and comfortable and quite fast. I enjoyed watching the desolate and empty Spanish countryside go by. I got to Granada and walked to my hostel, which was a little far up a hill in the Albaicin, but quite nice. Plus, I got a private room this time so I looked forward to catching up on some sleep. I walked around the Albaicin a bit, then got a shawarma and chatted with a nice couple on their honeymoon and the shop owner, hung out at the hostel a bit and chatted with some more people before heading to bed.\n\nDay 5 Granada: I spent the day exploring the city, specifically the Sacromonte and Albaicin. I saw the Cuevas de Sacromonte Museum (really cool with a great view of the city and Alhambra), the Alcaiceria (interesting but not a must see) and the Mirador San Nicolas (another cool lookout, although the one in Sacromonte was better). That night I went out with some hostel folks and felt like I finally had my first Spanish tapas experience where we got cheap drinks and shared lots of free tasty tapas. \n\nDay 6 Granada: I spent most of the day at the Alhambra, which was stunning, although I regret not getting an audioguide as there wasn't a lot of signage. I also wish I had gotten my nasrid palace pass a little earlier, since I was able to see everything else in the morning and had to return for the palaces (and I got rained on when I did). It did let me come back to town for a great lunch though. I then went out to dinner at a Lebanese(?) place where I got this lentil soup that might've been one of the best meals I've ever had. I then went to another tapas bar after (because I had to of course) and got some really cool tapas at Bar Poe. \n\nDay 7 Granada/Seville: I had decided to take a bus to Seville since it was significantly cheaper than the train. Several of my hostelmates had the same idea, so we had a big caravan to the bus station. The bus ride to Seville was fine, if unremarkable. The wifi worked perfectly for 30 minutes and then just completely disappeared, which was weird. Upon arriving in Seville I checked into my hostel, stopped for a late lunch and then later met up with some people I met through the hostelworld app for paella and drinks, which was a great time and the people I met up with were wonderful.\n\nDay 8 Seville/Cordoba: I had booked another day trip, this time later in the day thankfully, to Cordoba. Here I met with one of the people I had dinner with the night before. We got a fantastic lunch before parting ways so I could see the Mezquita, which was gorgeous. I didn't realize that the Feria de Cordoba was that day, but I decided to check it out and was impressed, it reminded me of an American State Fair but way cooler with lots of little houses with different kinds of music, dancing and drinks. It felt a little weird being there by myself, and I almost wish I had stayed a night so I could've spent more time there and enjoyed it more, but it was still a cool experience. Unfortunately, the fair messed with the bus schedule so I had to make a long walk back to the train station. By the time I got back to my hostel, I was exhausted, but not too exhausted to go out. One of my hostelmates took me and another girl on a last minute impromptu night-time tour of the city, seeing the Cathedral, and we then spent the rest of the night drinking (a little too much) and dancing in Las Setas.\n\nDay 9 Seville: So I felt a little bad about getting as hungover as I did, since I had plans to meet up with an old friend I hadn't seen in 4 years who happened to be working in Spain. Luckily, after getting some lunch I felt much better, and got another little informal tour of the city, this time seeing the river, Jewish Quarter and Plaza de Espana(way exceeded my expectations!) After she left a bit before dinner time, I ran into some people at the hostel, one of whom just happened to have been a Michelin starred chef, and offered to cook us up some risotto in the hostel (10 out of 10 highly recommend) and I ended up drinking with them for the rest of the night.\n\nDay 10 Seville: So by the this time I was starting to run out of steam a bit. I slept in a bit, got some lunch in town, and then hit up the Alcazar. It was quite beautiful, although I could feel the fatigue setting in, and went back to my hostel to just recharge for a few hours and pack up a bit. I went to La Carboneria for a quick and cheap Flamenco show, which was cool but not quite what I expected and the seating situation wasn't the best. I ended up spending the rest of the night hanging out the same people as the night before, although I could feel that my social batteries were quite drained and I didn't vibe as much with everyone as before. I went to bed early, since I had an early day the next day.\n\nDay 11 Seville: So this day I had booked a tour for the Caminito Del Rey. Normally I try to avoid organized tours, but trying to figure out the trains to El Chorro from Seville was such a hassle I just forked over the money to save myself the headache, and honestly it was worth it. Having someone else take care of all the logistics at this point in the trip was so nice. The hike was fairly easy, but incredibly beautiful and rewarding, I highly recommend it. After getting back, I got some tapas at a low key bar by myself, then checked out of my hostel and into an airbnb that was in the Feria district, since it was a bit closer to the airport and I was burnt out of socializing. The airbnb ended up being incredible, the hosts were absolutely delightful and accommodating and the place had an amazing terrace with a great view. I ended up trying a few more tapas places before I headed to bed.\n\nDay 12 Seville: This was my last full day in Spain, and I took full advantage of it. I felt a little sick in the morning from eating too much the night before, but I eventually felt better, and I was able to rent a bike down the street from my airbnb (Bici4City for those who want to know, really nice place, the rentals were convenient, affordable and the bikes were pretty decent). I rode out of town up to Italica, and toured the ruins, which were way bigger than I expected and rather impressive. I then headed back into town, got lunch in Triana, went back to the Plaza de Espana one more time before returning the bike and heading to the Museo del Baile Flamenco for another Flamenco show. This one was a bit pricier, but worth it, it felt much more professional and entrancing. I then headed back to my airbnb, got some food to go, spent a little time on the terrace before heading to bed early.\n\nDay 13 Seville: My flight left from Seville at 9am, and my airbnb hosts were nice enough to get me a taxi at 6:30. I got a quick flight from Seville to Madrid, before flying back home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReflections:\n\nMy trip was all around fantastic. All of the anxieties I had before hand were completely unfounded and dissipated after a day or two. I met a lot of really cool people (some annoying and boring people too, but mostly cool), and actually surprised myself how much I was able to interact with people since I'm usually pretty introverted. I did notice that I got a bit sick of constantly meeting new people by the end, but felt like I did a pretty good job overall. The amount of time felt right too, by the end I was getting fatigued and if I had to stay more than a day or two longer it would've been a bit too much. The food was with a few exceptions both fantastic and cheap, which was a winning combination. My accommodations were a mixed bag, but were generally positive, I particularly liked the Oripando in Granada. Overall, Spain was absolutely lovely, and unlike a lot of places I visit I honestly don't think I would mind coming back. Granada was by far my favorite due to the chill vibes, and cheap and tasty food. Seville was a close second, and Madrid was great, but definitely not my favorite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFavorite Moments:\n\n\\- Seeing the Caminito del Rey, absolutely stunning\n\n\\- Going out to eat in Granada pretty much anywhere\n\n\\- Renting that bike, I love cycling and Italica really exceeded my expectations\n\n\\- Catching up with an old friend, I know it kind of defeats the point of solo travel, but it was really nice to reconnect with someone and have a familiar face after a week of constantly meeting people\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeast Favorite Moments:\n\n\\- My hostel bed in Madrid being right next to the bathroom\n\n\\- Struggling with jet lag and culture shock the first few days\n\n\\- Being told on my last day that I was ordering food in Spanish the wrong way the whole time\n\n\\- Being deceived by the size of the line for the Templo de Debod\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBudgeting:\n\nFlights - about $900, but I had a $400 flight credit so only paid $500\n\nAccommodations: $230 for first night in hotel, $65 Madrid Hostel, $190 for private hostel room in Granada, $90 for Seville hostel, and $160 for airbnb. Total of $735.\n\nTransportation: Between my trains to Granada, Toledo and Cordoba, and my bus to Seville I spent 144 on transportation. This doesn't count taxis or travel within cities.\n\nI took out 400 euros in cash ($475 from my bank), which I ended up using all of. I spent an extra $350 on various meals, excursions, drinks, etc on my card.\n\nAltogether this came out to about $2200 for the whole trip, which actually left me under budget.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope someone finds this useful or interesting, thanks for reading!",

I wasn\u2019t even trying to be particularly frugal, i just overestimated how much things cost in Spain since I come from a pretty expensive place. Another thing I forgot to mention was that the amount of cash I took out wasn\u2019t necessary. With the exception of a few bars in Granada almost every place took card, and cash felt more like an inconvenience.",

The double decker will be cool though, the views between cities is absolutely stunning!",

If you\u2019re looking for someplace busier (although still not as much as Madrid), better nightlife, more traditional Spanish culture, and more tourist attractions then Seville is the way to go. Seville also has really good cycling infrastructure if you\u2019re into that.",

    "postText": "I got sick on the second week of my 6 week trip around europe (it's week 4 now). I was really sick for few days and after that i've just had this persisntent cough that won't go away.\n  \nI've been resting as much as i could because i wanted to get better before i get to Portugal so that i get healthy enough to surf. At some point i felt it getting better but then i had food poisoning and it got worse again. I felt it getting better but then i walked around too much and didn't get enough sleep on a night bus and it got worse again.\nI haven't gone out to party since the first week so that i don't make it worse, i have stayed inside instead of going sightseeing so that i wont make it worse, i haven't socialised as much in hostels so that i wouldn't be tempted to go out and make it worse.\nAnd here i am, in Portugal unable to surf because it got worse.\n\nHow to cope with the disappointment that i saved all this money, spent all that time in a trip that was almost complitely ruined because i got sick twice while on it and apparently my lungs are just straight trash?",

Shit happens and you deal with them whether you are traveling or not.\n\nTreat yourself well and take a rest if you have to. Don't be hard on yourself or your lungs because you did what you can do to make things better. Perhaps you can tell yourself that you can go back another time. Also take time to appreciate what's around even if it's not what you wanted to do in the first place.",

It got really bad in the last few days and I was so scared about my flights home. Googled, read about dextromethorphan and bought it. My cough 95% went away that first day I took it and stayed away.

            "comment": "As much as the world is pretending it\u2019s over, COVID is still very much out there\u2026 which unfortunately significantly increases the risk of getting laid out sick on a trip. Based on what you describe (especially the persistent cough), you probably caught whatever new variant is in vogue at the moment.\n\nI\u2019ve done a ton of travelling in the last year and I\u2019ve some how managed to avoid it, though I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s more through sheer luck than the precautions I\u2019ve taken. That said\u2026\n\nMy precautions that apparently have served me well and that I\u2019d recommend to folks:\n\n- Keep your immune system strong. When I\u2019m travelling, I take a daily vitamin C, D, zinc and magnesium supplement. I also drink plenty of water and make sure I\u2019m getting at least eight hours of sleep a night.\n- Re-up your COVID booster if you\u2019re eligible a week or two before a big trip. Protection from infection with the vaccines wanes fairly fast (about 3-4 months), so if it\u2019s been a while since you boosted, strategically getting one just before a trip will help you avoid getting infected. Keep up to date on other relevant vaccines too (flu, yellow fever etc.)\n- Wear an N95 in high-risk settings. Yeah I get that masking is (somehow) considered a political statement or something, but I still wear one on flights/trains or if I\u2019m around someone that I hear hacking up a lung. \n- If you can afford it, go with a private room or hotel room rather than shared hostel room. See that thread from a while back about \u201cEuropean Hostel Cough\u201d where people were saying the vid absolutely rips through hostels (makes sense\u2026 if you\u2019re sleeping right next to an infected person, you\u2019re going to be breathing in whatever junk they\u2019re exhaling for hours on end, and the viral load is gonna be enough to guarantee you get sick). \n\nLike anything, none of the above will guarantee you avoid getting COVID or anything else - but it\u2019ll reduce the risk materially.",

(Less in the airplane but more on the airport.)\n\nI am relaxed about it, meaning I do take it off for eating and when it is uncomfortable but wear it otherwise.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about Covid but to reduce the overall exposure to bacteria and viruses. You are unable to touch your face as much as well which further helps. \n\nIn short, I don\u2019t get sick anymore from traveling. \n\n(Except from my darn spouse who refuses to wear it and then gets sick and then makes me sick.)",

My whole 10 days went to trash. I literally spent the whole time in the hotel ordering room service and spent maybe 2 hours total outside exploring. \n\nTrip 2:  Ireland October 2021. I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy 2 days before I left. I couldn't socialize or explore other cities, so I did like 2 activities my whole trip there. All my money down the drain, again.\n\nTrip 3: I got a new job October 2022 and they needed someone to hit the floor running, those 3 weeks of orientation literally landed on my trip dates so I had lost my non-refundable trip to Bellagio, Italy. (I did not bring it up at time of interview because I knew they would go with the next candidate)\n\nStuff like this happens all the time, and we really have no control over it sometimes.

Decided to do this big trip with my gf where we drive from Orlando to Jupiter, Jupiter to Miami, Miami to Everglades and Everglades to Key West over a two week period. Hurricane Irma decided otherwise. Still made the trip but where we were gonna camp in Everglades was closed due to storm flooding and Dry Tortugas was fcked up. Our hotel on the beach in KW had just flooded and it smelled and it looked like it. Ants everywhere, chemical smell mixed with mildew smell. \n\nOK, well that's alright December of that year (last year) there is also a week long cruise with three stops we had planned. Seasick a good part of the time and then had a covid like illness. That confined me to the room for half of it, running a fever, diarrhea, etc in addition to the sea sickness. \n\nMy point in all of this is shit happens. It sucks but you make the best of it as best as you can and move on. Hope you feel better.",

Just do literally everything you can to make yourself feel better. Spare no expense on a  pharmacy, doctor visit, medication, masks if you are able to purchase any of that. Make yourself as comfortable as possible and then do whatever you can do. It\u2019s ok to rest when you need to rest. It\u2019s pretty fun to sit in a hostel and eat your lunch you got from the farmers market and watch all the shit on Netflix that isn\u2019t on in the US. You also dont have to worry about getting others sick if you just make your trip about nature. Wear masks on the bus and then go sit in a park, an arboretum, a beach, a forest, a botanical garden, by a canal, a sculpture garden, a beer garden (and drink water.) bring a sketchpad and a box of tissues and a waterbottle and just post up. Bring a pillow if you want. There\u2019s no rules on how to enjoy yourself",

            "comment": "When I was travelling long term I got sick in every destination I went to. Whether it was by plane, train, bus, whatever - I always caught something. This was prior to covid and masking wasn't common. I did pick up some pretty cool black masks in Taiwan mainly due to exhaust/smog issues, but it hardly did anything for that, and it was near the end of my travels. They came in handy for a while during covid though!\n\nI got so sick in some places I honestly wasn't sure if I was gonna pull through. Like *days* of not being able to get out of bed and being horribly ill. Sometimes I'd drag myself to a doctor but in places with language barriers that was a bit tough. Honestly even though I had insurance for every trip I was on, I never used it. Too much paperwork and bs, and much of the time it was cheap enough to afford to just pay for it and not worry too much about getting things signed by doctors who didn't speak my language (which is what was needed much of the time), among other requirements, all while being sick.\n\nAnyway, it sucked but it's part of travelling. Your body isn't prepared for these germs. I like to joke that i probably had covid 16 through 18, lol.\n\nSometimes I also pushed myself too hard too soon after being sick and it would come raging back. I didnt have to worry about time as much as someone on a stricter schedule, but losing so many days was still crappy. But hopefully you can enjoy what you can, stay in and watch some Netflix or whatever and nurse yourself back to health. Or find a nurse to help you out if you know what I mean... \ud83d\ude0f that helped me sometimes too lol.\n\nAnyway try not to sweat it too much. here's to getting better and continuing on!",

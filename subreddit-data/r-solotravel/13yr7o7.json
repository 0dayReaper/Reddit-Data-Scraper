    "postText": "We've all gotten the \"how was your trip?\" question when we get back home, but I find it really difficult to describe it besides just saying that it was good or great. I'm not sure how to explain my trip when I've done so much, met so many amazing people, and all the breath taking sites I've seen. I'm also American, and we don't really have a backpacking culture, or one of traveling for more than maybe a week.\nSo how do you all even begin telling your friends or family back home who ask of your trips? Especially after you've traveled for months and to multiple countries?",

When i ask other people about their trip, i personally want to hear about the amazing experiences they had, but i also want to hear about the not so great times. But like you said, no one wants to hear about that time the train broke down in the middle of no where for 3 hours, you randomly got a debilitating migraine, you didn\u2019t speak the language, and didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on (actual experience I had lol). I want the full story; good, bad, and ugly. But most people just don\u2019t care about the truth",

If they feel stuck in their jobs or just burnt out by life itself then some 21 year old comes at you telling you to travel more and that it'll expand your mind, etc. I think in regards to the question asked here the best answer is probably to keep it short and modest UNLESS they ask more.

Because for most of us solos, there are so many layers of being alone and experiencing things that are not part of a 'oh how was your trip?' question.\nI recently returned from a trip, and it changed me. Mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually, and I tell people that. The people who really care about me and are connected to me ask me more, and I tell them. For the people who are making small talk, the next question is usually, 'Oh, where you go?\" (with utter surprise in their question). I don't tell them as much bc the question is shallow. But for the people, I go into it. It's about connection and sharing \ud83e\udef6",

The concept of solo travelling is very new to my fam and I am the first one and the only \"boy\" in the family to ever go on a solo trip for a week. So filtering out all the basic photos will help you cause then you avoid the whole question, instead just show em these filtered collection of photos. Then it doesn't matter if even the most annoying/curious member joins and watches it. \n\nWhen it comes to answering this to your friends, I think you can be kinda honest with them about your traveling experience cause same age group kinda gets it even if your friends are not travelers or do not like it. A good way to not answer this same question is to meet all your friends at dinner/lunch/breakfast and spill the beans all at once.",

If I dont know the person very well, and theyre just looking free info with a  question like \"what was the best place\" - I usually reply with \"it was all good in its own way\". If its a good friend or relative who I know is interested in, let's say, dogs, I will start talking about some interesting dogs I saw along the way. Having said that, Ive given up trying to explain to my father. He is too old and cant really relate to my stories, so I have to simplify them.  I have been abroad now for longer than I ever was at home, so its getting hard for me to relate things back to people in my own country, which I view as a kind of parallel universe... contained in a bubble where the only window to the outside world is TV news or the internet. Especially when they start asking about the cost, and how could I afford it, how they \"know how dangerous it could be\" and how I missed out on real estate profits etc. I once went to a Christmas dinner where I only knew three of the 12 guests. I ended up being bombarded with all sorts of questions, but as the wine flowed, some of the questioning became snide. One guy even threw his fork loudly down on his plate and grumbled \"Ive heard enough of your bulls...!\" when I told him I got sequestered into being a Bollywood extra on the street, but ended up getting a paid role in along running tv series. ( I found out later he was a money-rich, time -poor kind of guy recently divorced.) I think everyone dreams of extended travel, but family and work commitments means some cant, and if you push the joys of long term travel too much, people who choose to stay home and pay off the mortgage see you as some sort of threat. They are looking for re-assurance that they took the right path by staying home.You upset their world-view, and they dont like that. So you have to be humble.",

Unless you are a traveller you will probably not be genuinely interested in learning about other peoples and cultures.  People just want to hear you had a great time of you had an incredible or awful experience.  Yes meeting people from around the world was very educational but most people cannot relate to your experiences.  \n\nWe travelled for [**three years Round The World**](https://terraencounters.wordpress.com/2018/03/06/top-20-countries/).  We shared our experiences by developing a slide show of some of our photos.  We then developed a scripted talk about what our experiences were related to each photo.  That was the only exposure friends and family got to our trip.  I think that helped.  \n\nBut we did want to share our tens of thousands of images and experiences with willing listeners.  So we approached the University of Alberta and gained acceptance for several extension courses on the art and architecture, culture and cuisine for a selected set of countries.  We got [**rave reviews**](https://terraencounters.wordpress.com/testimonial/appreciating-asia-student-3/) and met lots of like-minded people who paid to attend these extension courses.  While many of these people had not travelled (yet) like us, they were interested in doing so.  That was the best way of sharing our enthusiasm and joy of travel.  Plus we made friends with some of the people.",

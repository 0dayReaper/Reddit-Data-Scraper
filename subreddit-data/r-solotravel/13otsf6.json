You can basically go straight through from Moab&gt;Vegas&gt;CA. \n\nWorth noting, though, if you're not driving it might be a pain. There's a tiny airport (Canyonlands) you can get to daily via Denver. Otherwise, you need to get to SLC first.",

Pictured Rocks is a beautiful place to visit.\n\nI see from other comments that you've got good advice about Washington (my now home state for 30+ years.)  For hikes, time of year does matter.  A good resource is the Washington Trails Association [https://www.wta.org/](https://www.wta.org/) .  You can search for hikes that are snow-free and you can also read trip reports.\n\nIf you are WA in the winter, have you considered going skiing?  You can rent all the equipment.  Years ago we had an Australian student stay with us and we took him skiing.  I don't think he'd ever seen snow before.  He loved it :)\n\nFor more urban adventures, in addition to what others have suggested, I would look into the Fremont District of Seattle.  Great little pubs and restaurants there.",

Same with the UP of Michigan - even more remote and gorgeous. Lake Superior is a treat if you're into kayaking, canoeing, fishing, etc. \n\nThat said, you said \"early 2024\". If you're going to be in Wisconsin/MI before, say, June, you're really risking some crappy weather. Spring can be cold, rainy, and even snowy. The hiking &amp; biking trails may be muddy or worse. Lake Superior is freezing, to the point that kayaking is dangerous. \n\nThat said, if you want to see some snow, January &amp; February in the UP of Michigan is gonna give you that in spades. Winter carnivals, dog sled races, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, skiing, etc etc. Tons of winter sports. But bring some very warm clothing!",

I live in the PNW and the sun sets at like 4pm for most of the winter + early spring, and a lot of the best hikes up in the mountains are largely inaccessible from \\~November-April due to feet of snow/avalanche risk, or at the very least require snow shoes and other specialized equipment. You also might have trouble getting to some of the farther out trailheads if you don't have a car. Not to say that you shouldn't go at all, but definitely be prepared for the conditions, especially if you're planning to hike by yourself.",

In April just be prepared for rain and some likely chilly coastal days. It wouldn't be a rain forest without rain, though so I try to be grateful for the greenery!\n\nThe hot springs are great, but won't take too much of your time. In that area of the state I'd also recommend checking out Kalaloch and Ruby and Rialto and Mora Beaches, as well as more of the Hoh Rain Forest. Crescent Lake, Lake Ozette, and Quinault are indeed beautiful as well.\n\nHope you enjoy your time here and take it all in. Our natural space is really quite spectacular.",

It's a fun little town with cute shops and good food, a few good breweries as well.\n\nIn Seattle you have a wide range of bar options. There is a big craft beer scene here, as well as some outstanding options for really good cocktails. And of course, food.\n\nThe Capitol Hill area of Seattle has a lot of lively bar options if you are more into the high energy, might end up accidentally dancing until 2am in a very colorful space, kind of vibe. It celebrates LGBTQ+ culture with unparalleled energy and is a good time. \n\nFor more laid back vibes, which is my style as my mid-30s require more recuperation time than my 20s did, finding a place with really good food and drinks isn't hard. Often you can find a live music or comedy event as well. \n\nHere is a helpful article from a local publication. It's an older article so the pandemic might have reshaped it a bit but the list is a good start.\n\nhttps://www.thestranger.com/visitors-guide/2018/06/20/27934365/best-places-to-get-a-drink-in-seattle",

Bus from Portland to Seattle is around $25 USD.  If you're flying out of the Bay Area to Portland, make sure to look at flights out of Oakland airport.  Both SFO and OAK have many flights to Portland.  Might save both time and money flying out of OAK.\n\nSomeone just posted to ask about \"Oregon Road Trip\".  Maybe have a look in there.  Seeing that jarred my memory for things to do in OR.\n\nIf you're going from Seattle to BC, take the ferry.  Driving across... not as scenic unless one likes seeing line up of cars.\n\nIf you're in WI and haven't been to Chicago before, couple of days there are well worth it.  Lots of free things to do there.  Food and beers there will probably be your speed.  Same with WI and OR.  OR and WI are beers states for sure.\n\nIf you're in Portland on a Wednesday night go to BeerMongers.  They have the great bottle share I've ever been to in my life.  Buy one bottle (will be reasonably priced unless you don't want it to be) and unlock drinking rare bottles for two or three hours.",

It\u2019s well known for being one of the most beautiful areas of the country and you can easily fill 12 days in Washington and still wish you had more time. Just be careful of the weather if you\u2019re going early in the year, higher elevations will be snowy. \n\nWith respect to the Midwest (I lived out there for 7 years and didn\u2019t hate it), most of it is not someplace I\u2019d go out of my way to visit. Is there cool and beautiful stuff to be found there? Sure. But if I only had a limited time in the US, I certainly wouldn\u2019t choose to spend 12 days in Wisconsin.\n\nRe: your 10 days in New York \u2014 I think you should split that time and see some of the rest of the Northeast. Upstate New York is great, especially for hiking, though if you\u2019re going early in the year the Adirondacks will still be snowy. That\u2019s true for the New England states too, you won\u2019t be able to do much hiking until May at the very earliest unless you want to be hiking through snow and ice, but Vermont and New Hampshire and even Maine are close to upstate New York and are all way more interesting than Wisconsin.\n\nHope you enjoy your trip, whatever you decide!",

I think if someone's spending a week in Chicago, Madison is well worth a weekend visit...\n\nAt least during certain parts of the year. In the summer and early autumn, it's awesome. We have one of the biggest farmer's markets in the country every Saturday of the summer around the state capitol building, along with tons of other food and art festivals. We've got a great local music scene, some beautiful nature in the form of bike trails and plenty of lakes with easily accessable kayak rentals. And in the early autumn, as the university students come back to town, the university campus hosts all kinds of fun events. \n\nBut even this time of year, the weather can be very unpredictable. There have been years when it's snowed a little in mid May, and other years when it's 90 Fahrenheit on that same date. I work in landscaping, and in mid April this year, I was out shoveling snow after 12 inches fell in one night. In April! If you more or less start your trip here in early 2024 as you say, it's anyone's guess what kind of weather you're going to get. April and even May would be a gamble, I would strongly recommend against March or earlier.\n\nNorthern Wisconsin is really pretty though, if nature is what you're going for. It won't compare to the Pacific Northwest, but Door County in the northeastern part of the state is really nice, as well as up on Wisconsin's northern Lake Superior shoreline.\n\nIf you do decide to spend less time here and maybe don't want to travel from Madison all the way up to Door County or Lake Superior, [the driftless area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driftless_Area) in the southwestern corner of the state is more accessable from Madison and still quite beautiful.",

While the snow can be beautiful it can also be extremely dangerous due to icy roads and avalanche risk. \n\nIf you are set on going to Wisconsin I would highly recommend also hitting the upper peninsula of Michigan. It is absolutely stunning and has abundant forests and lakes. However Wisconsin/Michigan will be COLD in the early months of the year, they\u2019re generally more fun starting around May because there are also no leaves in the winter and it is just barren and bleak and dark in the winter months, not leafy and beautiful. I understand the appeal of the snow but it can be insanely cold there, and also a lot of touristy areas are closed in winter",

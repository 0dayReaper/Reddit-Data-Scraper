    "postText": "I'm looking at renting a car solo for a 23 day period in October this year, which I will pickup and drop-off from Rome. It's possible to get some cars through 3rd party booking sites like HolidayCars.com for less than 12 euros a day. This are not crappy cars either but modern ones like the Citroen C3.\n\nHow can this be? Is it just because October is in the low season? Are these 3rd party booking sites trustworthy?\n\n  \nEdit: The price on one of the third party booking sites I just looked at is somehow less than half the cost of booking directly with the rental company!?

Make sure your hire agreement is \u2018full/full\u2019 for fuel which means you get the car with a full tank and return it with one and pay them \u20ac0 for fuel. Holidayautos have lots of full/full hires.\n\nA boiling hot car rental booking hall in the airport with long queues is a truly miserable place and rental companies capitalise on that by ripping people off because people are so desperate to just get the keys by that point they give in and pay.",

Use a very good credit card like a Chase Sapphire preferred for the built-in insurance, decline all additional insurance, and have a great vacation.\n\nIt's just like that. Sometimes they're really expensive and sometimes they're really cheap when demand is low.",

I specifically opted for a non-electric vehicle (didnt want to deal with charging infrastructure), however when I showed up that's what their system has me down for. Had to pay extra for a gas/hybrid, am waiting for reimbursement for the difference.\n\nAlso, some companies charge a 1-2k$ deposit on your card when you pick it up.",

            "comment": "Be very wary of those.  There\u2019s often problems at pickup when booking through those sites.  One of the biggest ones I\u2019ve fielded as a former manager is there is no prepayment but the third party site \u201ctook their money already\u201d.  Alternatively the total shown by the third party service is straight up wrong and there are hefty fees \u201cno one told us about\u201d when they actually pick up.  Less common was that the booking just never showed up.  \n\nSpecific to Italy there is additional coverage you will need to purchase.  Read it carefully as saving a few euros could be a very poor choice.",

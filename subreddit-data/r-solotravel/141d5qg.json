    "postText": "Hello fellow solo travelers! I'm a urban transportation planner and food adventurer from Ohio heading to the Pacific Northwest for the first time this July! Visiting Vancouver (4 days), Eugene (2.5 days), Portland (5 days), and Seattle (5.5 days) in that order respectively. No car on this trip, so Amtrak, public transport, and bikeshare would be how I'd get around. For each city, I focus on the following categories: food scene, urbanism/neighbo(u)rhoods/placemaking, nature/hiking/running, the two/three top tourist attractions (free or at a low cost), rainy day places, hidden gems. I'll put some things on my itinerary (it's too long if I list everything):\n\nVancouver: Salmon n'Bannock, Baby Dhal Roti Shop, Arbutus Greenway, Mount Pleasant (neighbo(u)rhood), Capilano Suspension Bridge\n\nEugene: Izakaya Meiji Co, Lion and Owl, some bike route, Whitaker (neighborhood), Alton Baker Park, Hayward Field\n\nPortland: Kann, Grand Fir Brewing, Boise (neighborhood), Ladd's Key to SE Portland (or another enjoyable and challenging bike route), Council Crest Park\n\nSeattle: Taku, Rachel's Bagels and Burritos, Pioneer Square (neighborhood), biking in the Green Lake neighborhood, Discovery Park\n\nTrain travel: I've heard that business class on Amtrak isn't really worth it, because contrarily on VIA Rail (CAN), you get a complementary meal and unlimited drinks throughout the whole journey. I'm thinking about just getting coach seats, including the journey from Vancouver, BC to Eugene w/a 1.5 hour layover in Seattle to dine and grab lunch. Do you agree I should just stick with coach seats?\n\nI've done solo travel every year since 2016 (minus 2020) visiting various places, and it's an extremely rewarding experience! For reference, chronologically, where I've traveled so far: Denver/Boulder, Boston, Los Angeles, NYC, SF/Oakland, Pittsburgh, Montreal, Toronto, Detroit.\n\nWhat else would you recommend I should do during this trip?",

Capitol Hill and Columbia City both have light rail stops and are cool areas to walk around. There\u2019s a foot ferry in downtown that will take you to Alki Beach (West Seattle) and that\u2019s also good for biking, but your choice of Green Lake is good as well. \n\nAs for restaurants, so many to choose from! I think the two you\u2019ve selected are solid. Would also recommend Pike Place Chowder. You\u2019ll wait in line at the Pike Place Market one, but you could always get it to go and head down to the park nearby to people and boat watch. The other location is in a mall, quick but boring views. :)\n\nDoes Amtrak run from Vancouver to Oregon? I rode it several years ago so things may have changed, but I had to take a bus to the train station in Bellingham WA. The ride from Bellingham to Seattle is beautiful in many places, lots of water views so sit on the right hand side.\n\nVancouver BC is a gorgeous city.\n\nHave oh so much fun on your trip!",

I\u2019m doing the hoh rainforest one but that requires a car. The hostel I\u2019m staying at will be doing a pub crawl and free walking tour, so will give those a shot. \n\nI\u2019m doing a solo trip to Seattle this summer too, though I have been there twice not solo.

It would almost certainly be more economical to do a multi day rental from a shop though, if doing lots of riding. I need to look into that. \n\nNo worries, I waited until my 3rd (upcoming) trip to check out Olympic. \n\nHaha yes, I'm talking about both of those! Tbh I have graduated from hostel stays, but I decided to give it a shot again since this will basically be my first solo trip. HotelHotel is in a much prettier location, but I like how staying in both encourages me to explore more of the city. \n\nI didn't realize Green Tortoise provided bikes, that's cool, I will check what kind. Personally it's important for me to have an e-bike since it helps me explore more and not avoid hilly areas. \n\nThe reviews of the Nordic museum are so so, but I might need to check it out anyway since that cultural influence on Seattle is one of the many reasons I like it.\n\nNo prob!

T-shirt, Long Sleeve, Rain Jacket, Puffy... etc.  \n\nBring water and snacks/sandwich or other food.\n\nI went on a trip to WA state in April and was delayed at the train station\n\nfor 3 hrs. because someone walked on the track and was hit. Business class was not available so we sat in Coach. On the way back there was no observation or snack car. Minimal snacks were provided but they did have the dining car. I already had drinks, snacks and food with me to save on the dining costs so it was nice I was prepared. I also have food allergies....\n\nOne thing I brought was a blanket scarf and a foam pad to sit on. It was nice on the hard benches at the station and the minimally padded seats on the train. Nice to have the scarf as a blanket on the train at night... air con is on all the time.\n\nThe snack car closes at 9:30pm so nice to have a granola bar for a late night, or an early morning snack.  Eye mask and earplugs are also great to have.\n\nHappy travels!",

It can get cold, at times, from what I heard.\n\nI might check out Chinatown-International District during my 90-minute layover in Seattle and get something there. I'll very likely stick w/coach seats. Blanket scarf, that's something to add on the list. Eyemask, earplugs, and snacks noted.\n\nThanks for your suggestions!",

            "comment": "I can give you my tips for Vancouver. \n\nActivities: Deep Cove can be a good place to visit for a mix of outdoor activities and transit friendly. There is an easy hike with a beautiful view and a calm inlet where you can go kayaking. Go on a weekday though because it is unenjoyable busy on a weekend. \n\nFood: I would recommend getting Korean and Cantonese food here. Vancouver has I think the second most Koreans outside of Korea behind LA, and I am sure top five for Cantonese outside of HK. So if you want stuff that are better here than the rest of North America, those are the cuisines imo. . For Korean food, assuming you stay in Vancouver So Hyang is my favourite but it is less central. If you want something downtown, Sura is always a classic. For Cantonese food, if you have time, go down to Richmond with the Skytrain. There are tons there, just do a Reddit search of foods in Richmond. Lido Cafe there is a favourite for many Cantonese people as well as honestly the food court at Aberdeen is bomb. But if you stay in Vancouver, places with Cafe Gloucester or BT Cafe are both classic HK style cafes in the areas you are visiting. I would say as a Canadian born Chinese, that my relatives from HK tell me the food here in Vancouver is as good as what they get back home.",

If I somehow don't make it to Deep Cove, is there another place for kayaking you would recommend?\n\nYes, as a fellow Asian North American, Korean and Cantonese food are essential in Vancouver. Some great recommendations on here!\n\nThanks for your recommendations!",

It's still really nice but tough to get around without a vehicle.\n\nIsland Park Walk is nice with great views of downtown, close to Granville Island and very central. You can take a water taxi from there as well which is fun.\n\nCommercial and Victoria Dr have some nice spots to walk around down the side streets.\n\nWalking through Gastown into Chinatown/Lower Eastside is a unique Vancouver experience, to put it lightly. Not for everyone but definitely eye opening. The wealth disparity here is very apparent.",

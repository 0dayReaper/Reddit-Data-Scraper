    "postText": "Hi, reposting with more detail\r  \n\r  \n I (18F, from east coast USA) am going to New Zealand from the end of July until mid-September. I will be staying most of the time in Christchurch and then for a week in the North Island.\r  \n\r  \nMy flight to NZ departs JFK on July 28th and is 16hrs 30 mins long. Any tips on surviving this flight? What to pack for food or entertainment?\r  \n\r  \nI will be traveling once to Wellington on August 10 to see one of the women's world cup games. \r  \n\r  \nAdditionally, I will be going on this tour, departing on September 2nd: \r  \nhttps://www.wildkiwi.com/tours/new-zealand/northern-voyager\r  \n\r  \nopinions on these kinds of tours? For people who have done these, is it easy to integrate into the group? I am worried about it being mainly couples on the tour.\r  \n\n\nMy interests are outdoors activities, exploring the city, and playing all sorts of games. \n\nMy budget is $5000 ( I have free housing except for 3 nights) \n\n\r  \nThank you!",

In summer, the trails are amazing, and so accessible. I really liked Waitangi (where the treaty was signed and there is lots of M\u0101ori history).",

I think in this case the tour is a great option, and I wouldn\u2019t worry about the social structure. People - even couples - who opt for tours like this one tend to be excited for the social aspect of the trip. I would consider it a built-in opportunity to meet other travelers and a welcome break from having to deal with logistics for a few days.",

And I believe the train system is more built up on North Island. \n\nI loved Christchurch, but I imagine you\u2019ll want to explore more of South Island. Getting to Queenstown or Milford Sound or Franz Josef Glacier (some of my favorite spots - most of which have great outdoor activities) would all be difficult to do without a car, and Queenstown is really the only spot where you could take a train to. You might want to consider a rental car or signing up for other small day trips to see more of the island. Somebody else mentioned bringing a bike, which does sound fun, but I can\u2019t speak much towards. \n\nI hope you\u2019re not turned off by this. One of the reasons so many areas in New Zealand are special is because they\u2019re not easy to traverse - and I only mentioned some of the bigger, well known areas. There are a ton of amazing gems throughout the islands. It\u2019s well worth the extra time and energy to take some day trips, or look into staying in more cities that may open up additional exploration. You have lots of time and a great resource of other solo travelers.",

It\u2019s really not that bad.\n\nThings to make the flight better: comfy clothes (I usually fly in sweatpants, sweatshirt and a merino tshirt), aisle seat so you can get up and move around a bit easily, knee high compression socks to stop nasty cankles, a decent eye mask, neck pillow and noise cancelling headphones.\n\nI\u2019ll always have some painkillers and tums just in case, and I take Benadryl to put myself to sleep when I want to rest.\n\nI take a water bottle and a gentle moisturizer and lip balm so I can moisturize my face and hands a couple of times during the flight. \n\nI put myself onto destination time as soon as I get on the plane in the US. Stay up as long as possible watching a few movies, I\u2019ll download some music onto my phone too, then take my benadryl once I\u2019m ready to snooze.\n\nYou don\u2019t need any extra stuff beyond the airline meals and snacks on the flight; eat something light before you get on and avoid alcohol or anything bubbly. Take some hard candy or mints if you want.",

I haven\u2019t done any of those tours before, but have done the hikes all the take you on with mates. Great fun. Comfy shoes are a must. Hope you have fun.

You can easily get shared rides through a Facebook group so could be a cool way to meet locals aswell. Methven which is the town closed to Mt hutt is very cool aswell and has hot pools to soak in after a days skiing.",

The Hooker Vally track there is amazing, worth a night staying there to be able to do the walk with more time. \n\nPicton, you can take a scenic train to. Lovely scenery, walks, and boat tours to do. Its a good way to get to or from Wellington as well, you can take the ferry from Picton to there.",

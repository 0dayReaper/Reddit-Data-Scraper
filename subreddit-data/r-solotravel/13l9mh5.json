    "postText": "My friend is getting married in Singapore in late April. I was thinking of using the wedding as an excuse to visit the area. Assuming I have 2 weeks available, with 3/4 days already booked in Singapore, what would you all suggest I do for the other 1.5 weeks?\n\nThings I'm interested in:  \n1. FOOD  \n2. History  \n3. Nature adventuring (hiking, caving, snorkeling)  \n4. Dancing  \n5. People watching\n7. Experiencing things I can\u2019t in USA\n\nThings I'm not interested in:  \n1. Sitting on a beach  \n2. Being on a boat for an extended period of time (I get VERY seasick)  \n3. Bar hopping (though I will go to 1 or 2 to try the local flavors)\n\nI\u2019m also not one who likes to linger and reflect. I\u2019m more of an absorb by going and doing kind of person. \n\nI am interested in spending some time in Thailand, and maybe Malaysia since it is right in between. Or I can head the other direction and go to Indonesia and the Philippines. What do you all think?\n\nAlso, is there anything not to miss in Singapore?",

I was surprised how much I liked Kuala Lumpur, definitely worth a few days.  And as someone else mentioned, Georgetown/Penang is awesome!  Malaysian food is really good, and they have really good Indian and Chinese food (this also applies to Singapore though).  I also really enjoyed visiting the Taman Negara Rainforest in Malaysia.  Vietnam and Cambodia and Thailand are great (I would rate them in that order) but if you want to minimize time traveling and maximize time actually visiting places I would do Malaysia.  Also has really great trains if you want to splurge a little on travel.",

Visit the National Gallery Singapore. They have special exhibitions and they have a large collection of art. You'll enjoy knowing their history, too. Try the Courtyard Cafe. \n\n3. You can go to Malaysia by bus. Visit Batu Caves, Botanical Garden and KL Forest Eco Park.",

Then go to Siem Reap, Cambodia, which is close to Bangkok. Good food, history and nature in the Angkor Wat temple complex. You could spend 2-3 days there because it\u2019s so big. Then go back to Bangkok for your flight back to the USA.",

Gardens by the bay is a good place for a walk though late April will be pretty hot.\n\nFor 1.5 weeks Malaysia and Singapore itself should have enough to cover but Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore or Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore would work.",

For history, I\u2019d recommend visiting the National Gallery and the Asian Civilisations Museums. There are also a couple of memorials scattered around the country if you\u2019re interested. [This](https://thehoneycombers.com/singapore/historical-places-singapore-travel/) is a pretty good list. \n3. There isn\u2019t much caving or snorkelling you can do in Singapore, and the highest natural point you can hike to is 164m above sea level (Bukit Timah Hill). For adventuring, you have better options in Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand.\n4. The nightlife in Singapore is good fun! The go-to clubs in Singapore at the moment are Zouk, Marquee, Prism, Yang, Phuture etc. If you meant dance studios, try O School, Danzpeople, or Converge. \n5. 100% doable. Go to a park or cafe.\n\nApart from all that, go do all the touristy spots like Sentosa, Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, etc. The skyline is gorgeous, especially at night. \n\nYou have quite a bit of time in SEA, don\u2019t spend too much time in Singapore. 3-4 days is more than enough to see and do everything. Spend more time in Malaysia and if you can, do Vietnam (I recommend Hanoi).",

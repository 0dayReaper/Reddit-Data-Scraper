    "postText": "22M doing my first solo trip. A little info about me first. I want to do a lot of sightseeing during the day with maybe one beach day in Barcelona and Faro. I\u2019d also like to do pub crawls on a lot of nights or at least go out to clubs/bars. I do like having a schedule/ things planned out but I\u2019d love to unwind on this trip and just go with the flow. \n\nI have my flights booked for next spring. I fly into Lisbon April 21 and fly out of Porto May 6. I am trying to decide if I\u2019ll have time to include Seville and Faro in my trip or if I should just cut them out so it\u2019s not too rushed. I\u2019d love to see as much as possible on my first solo trip. From all I\u2019ve read I know option 2 would probably be better but, I would really love to see Seville and go to Faro as well. I don\u2019t mind it being a little rushed because I\u2019d like to come back again and maybe spend some time in the places I most enjoyed. These are my two itinerary ideas right now, would love some feedback and guidance!!! Would also appreciate recommendations on day trips!\n\nOption 1:\n4/21 arrive Lisbon @9am and take a connecting flight to Madrid \n4/22 Madrid \n4/23 Madrid \n4/24 fly to Barcelona \n4/25 Barcelona \n4/26 Barcelona \n4/27 Barcelona \n4/28 Fly to Seville \n4/29 Seville \n4/30 Bus to Faro \n5/1 Faro \n5/2 Bus to Lisbon \n5/3 Lisbon \n5/4 Lisbon \n5/5 Train to Porto \n5/6 Fly home from Porto \n\nOption 2\n4/21 arrive Lisbon\n4/22 Lisbon \n4/23 Lisbon \n4/24 Lisbon \n4/25 Fly to Barcelona \n4/26 Barcelona \n4/27 Barcelona \n4/28 Barcelona \n4/29 Barcelona \n4/30 Barcelona \n5/1 Fly to Madrid \n5/2 Madrid \n5/3 Madrid\n5/4 Fly to Porto \n5/5 Porto \n5/6 Fly home from Porto",

            "comment": "I think you've articulated your own dilemma well.  If you are cool with being constantly in motion you can make Option 1 work. \n\nBut option 2 just seems like a nicer trip.  And with the longer stays, you can still make day trips happen - like Girona, Taragonna, or Sitges from Barcelona or popping over to Toledo from Madrid.  And day trips can be easily canceled if you're tired or just not feeling it.\n\nWhichever option you choose, I would recommend stealing a day from Barcelona for Porto.  Flying in one day and out the next won't give you time to see the city and enjoy its unique vibe (especially away from the Ribera, which these days is insanely crowded).",

            "comment": "How about in between the two options? Option 1 you're doing 6 cities, option 2 you're doing 4. I haven't been to Faro, but I will say Sevilla is definitely worth checking out. I would say Madrid and Barcelona warrant their time, you can probably do Sevilla in one day less than those two. I try to give at least 2 full days, 1 half day at each city. \n\n\nMaybe:\n\n4/21-4/24 Lisbon\n\n4/24-4/27 Sevilla\n\n4/27-4/30 Madrid\n\n4/30-5/3 Barcelona\n\n5/3-5/6 Porto\n\nIt's doable, but this is if you wanna do things fast-paced. Train to each, except fly from Barcelona to Porto. Trains might be 5-7 hours long. With this you get two full days at each location. Then whatever you get on travel days. Maybe steal a day from Sevilla, give to Madrid or Barcelona. I just did a similar trip, pretty fast paced, lots of sightseeing during the day, going out at night, sleep 4-5 hours, repeat. It's doable for a shorter trip but might be too tiring for a true backpacking multimonth long trip.",

See if the price is comparable to arrive in Lisbon and leave from Madrid. Ideal itinerary would be Lisbon to Porto, then fly from Porto to Barcelona, then train to Madrid from Barcelona. Fly home from Madrid.",

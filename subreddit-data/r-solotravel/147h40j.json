Any recommendations?\nMain thing I\u2019m worried about is any safety concerns? \nMy home country recommends not travelling to these areas currently, I think this is general precaution. Has anyone else been recently?",

But if you've visited Arabic countries then you've already beaten the final boss, the sun won't be bothering you",

If you step outside in the sun during summer you can literally feel it crisping your skin up like a rotisserie chicken. I never felt that anywhere in the US and could even get away with only applying sunblock 1-2 times a day whereas at home you\u2019d need to apply 3-4 times.\n\nI haven\u2019t been to the Middle East before but I think people used to living in harsh climates find it easier to adapt elsewhere.

They fed me soup and tea but yeah just a heads up. Might be wiser to fly to Erbil airport, or maybe I was just unlucky.\n\nShame because I was looking forward to experiencing another region or Kurdistan, had already been in Iran and Turkey's parts",

By nearest diplomatic mission, I mean sometimes countries designate smaller, local missions to assist citizens having trouble, like UK Embassies tasked with assisting Commonwealth citizens in Eastern Europe or US Consulate near Turkish - Syrian border liaising with contacts in Syria and Iraq. Such embassies usually share warnings or advice if there's a reliable threat or trouble and may be able to assist quicker if they know you're there. \n\nGood luck.",

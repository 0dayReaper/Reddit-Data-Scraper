Taking with me just a carry on and a backpack, since I'll be there in summer (August) and probably I'll be wearing light clothes.\n\n I'm still thinking what can I do on my 8 days itinerary. I'm staying at a hotel on International Drive. I'm not renting any car and that's what I've planned so far:\n\nDay 1 - arriving day. I'm going to arrive about 10am and my hotel check-in is 4pm. Honestly not sure what to do between this interval.\n\nDay 2 - Universal Studios \n\nDay 3 - Universal Islands of adventure\n\nDay 4 - Either visiting Seaworld or Disney Hollywood Studios (let me know what you guys recommend)\n\nDay 5 - Go shopping at Orlando Outlets\n\nDay 6 - ?\n\nDay 7 -?\n\nDay 8 - Departure day. I need to check out until 11 am and my flight is 5pm. I might just have lunch somewhere and take an Uber to the airport.",

When you get to your hotel, you can probably ask already if you can check in. If they have a clean room there's no reason not to give it to you. If not, you can leave your luggage with them and start exploring.\n\nI like Hollywood Studios over Seaworld.",

The airline's chatbox is useless and their call centres are not picking up phone",

I actually had this problem pre-COVID because I just didn't know you needed proof of being about to fly to get into the airport. A guard with a HUGE gun gave me a wifi password and let me look it up on my phone. Super helpful.",

I just flew out of T2 most recently in March '23 and before that in November '22, both times I just had to show a copy of my ticket and not a boarding pass (which you may receive after you check in).\n\nMy sister flew Vietjet in February as well and she had the same issue with no online check in and was able to just be checked in at T2, there was no issue entering the airport",

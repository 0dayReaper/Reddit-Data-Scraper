    "postText": "Hey everyone! I haven\u2019t travelled solo in quite a while so I\u2018d appreciate some help or feedback for my 3,5 week travel plans to Australia for March next year. \nAustralia is probably the biggest country I\u2018ve travelled to thus far, so I\u2019m not sure if I over- or underestimate a few things. I\u2018m a slow traveller too and need time to adjust to a new country/time zone. \nMy plan is to just focus on the east coast with this trip although there a few things on the west I\u2018d like to see as well but oh well\u2026 \nHere\u2018s my plan so far: \n\n1st stop would be Singapore. There\u2019s no direct flight from my country so I\u2018d have to stop here anyways. I\u2018ve been there before and would like to spend around 2-3 there again, just because I think otherwise I would be way too drained after a twenty-something hour flight + jetlag \n\n2nd stop would be Cairns/Pourt Douglas for around a week. I\u2018d like to wind down, go snorkeling, visit the Daintree Rain Forest etc. \n\n3rd stop would be Brisbane for another week. I\u2018m thinking of renting a car to explore different beaches around this area like the Sunshine Coast, Gold Coast, Byron Bay etc. and learn how to surf a bit. \n\n4th and last stop would be Sydney. I probably don\u2019t have to list all the things I\u2018d like to see there. \n\nI\u2018m not sure if I should take a short flight everytime or go by bus. That really depends on how much money I will have saved by then but it looks like flights may be possible. \nI\u2018d also really like to visit Melbourne or Tasmania, but I\u2018m not sure if that\u2019s too far south when I start at Cairns/Port Douglas. So I\u2018m thinking about skipping Brisbane and just going to Sydney and then to Melbourne, maybe even Tasmania but I reckon that\u2019d be a bit much. What do you guys think? Any advice is appreciated!!",

There's can be some banging days, but def a lot of rain.  \n\nThat being said, nrl and footy start up in March.  Def go see a game if you are into sports.  \n\nI did the opposite trip in Feb 6 years ago.  Rent a car and drove up.  Did a catamaran tour of the Whitsundays.  Stunning!!!  I wish I spent more time in the Daintree rainforest and Frasier island though.\n\nBrisbane itself  was meh. It's just close to some cool outdoorsy places.  Noosa is better.  There's a national Park there and I saw wild koalas!  Great kayaking too. \n\nMelbourne is worth fitting in if you can.  Getting to see the fairy penguins and the great Ocean road are pretty magical things.",

There's still some tourists coming in March, just not as much.\n\nI didn't really feel it any worse when I did my to road trip in Feb.  There's a reason why it's so busy is cause the weather is just that much better.  \n\nHonestly, the big places like opera house and Bondi will always be hectic.  But you can still get spots at the bar and restaurants and cheap grub places.  Just be wary the weather in March is historically rainy.",

            "comment": "In some of the subs I've been to, there's a saying for those going to Japan: Only go to two temples per visit because anymore runs the risk of being temple'd out.\n\nWhile I can only speak for Mel and Syd, you might experience some form of \"being temple'd out\" depending on what you want to do.\n\nSay, if you go to a place with boats, beaches, and parks, then you don't want to spend traveling 6-8 hours by land just to go visit another set of boats, beaches, and parks.\n\nIf you're spending almost a month in Australia, it would be better to try and not duplicate the places you'll be seeing. Not to mention those cities are all coastal, so the sceneries can get really identical, which may dampen your excitement by the third week.\n\nAnyway, you can't really go wrong with Sydney or Melbourne. They're the two most recommended cities because they don't offer the same things. Sydney's good for the structures and parks (and the whole \"wow, so many tourists like me\" vibe) while Mel is amazing if you'll rent a car.\n\nFor flights vs cars, I'm not a fan of land travel, especially exceeding 6 hours, so I would always suggest a flight, but maybe doing it by train won't be so bad. Then again, you have to weigh in on how fresh you want to arrive at your destination and if you're okay losing a day if you're too tired.",

You can get a greyhound pass called the \u201cEast Coast Whimit\u201d pass which allows you to book unlimited amount of greyhound trips within 30 days. That being said I had a 13h bus ride from Sydney to Byron, and have a 19h from Brisbane to Airlie Beach coming up. It\u2019s dreadful. The views can be pretty but being cooped up in a bus for that long is just dreadful. Jet star and Virgin Airlines have decently cheap domestic flights if you don\u2019t have a ton of luggage, that I personally would look into instead of the Whimit pass.",

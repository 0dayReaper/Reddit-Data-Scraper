    "postText": "I recently made a plan to travel Europe for the month of August, and my parents are completely against it. \n\nAt the start, they said no, not until I\u2019ve planned out every single thing, i.e. how far everything is from the train station, how much everything is etc. I did, and now my mother has gone and changed saying that I\u2019m not doing it. I\u2019m 21 years old with more than enough money saved. \n\nThey said they don\u2019t want for me to go alone, that I should go with someone else. Anyone who I would want to go with is broke (I don\u2019t have that much friends anyway) and I would much rather do it by myself. \n\nThe plan is Paris, Luxembourg, Baden-Baden, Zurich, Lugano, Milan, Verona, Venice. It will be my first time solo travelling. \n\nMy parents say if I do it I will not be let back inside the house. I have tried to explain the importance and I know that they are frightened for me travelling alone, I am the youngest so it must be scary for them. I am experienced at travelling. Talking to them is like talking to a brick wall. I could do it against their wishes but it makes me feel horrible, but my situation right now is unbearable to continue, and this is something I need to do. \n\nAre they right? Please someone give me advice, I am very upset.",

Will you need support from them in any way when you return from the trip?\n\nIf NO, tell them you are going, you are sorry that they are not supportive of your decision, and you sincerely hope they will change their minds about disowning you when you return. If you cave to their demands, you will be telling them that they have found the right strategy to control all large decisions in your life (who to date, where to move, what type of work to do). \n\nIf you ARE reliant on them for housing or financial support, take the money you've saved for travel and move out to your own place, or use it to replace any income they were giving you instead. Plan a smaller, more financially responsible trip, and tell them that you will focus on being entirely independent now, so that you can make your own travel plans without anyone else's input in the future. And then budget for a month-long trip next year, or whenever you can actually afford it.",

What you are planning isn\u2019t crazy or irresponsible, and even though they sound like they are letting fears control their reaction, that shouldn\u2019t rule your life. Move out, become independent, and plan your solo travel however you like and can afford. Move into a shared apartment or house if that will enable you to put money aside for travel. But do as much as you can while young and healthy!",

I\u2019m in my 30s btw lol. So I put her on an information diet. She gets the dates of the trip and my lodging info shortly before the trip (how shortly depends on a lot of factors that basically boil down to the vibe I\u2019m getting from her lol). But basically I don\u2019t give her enough time to try to get in the way of my plans, she just gets told this is what I\u2019m doing BUT gets lots of pictures texted or emailed during the trip. So focusing on the positive. I also text her when I arrive/leave. I think this has actually helped her anxiety and she\u2019s much more chill about it now.",

Shutting them out entirely only causes them to ruminate and obsess about the worst possible outcomes.\n\nShortly before a trip, print out or email your flight no, itinerary, and where you'll be staying (if you think they won't cancel it). Send them a text at different stops along the way so they know you're alive and doing well. Let them know when you get home safely.\n\nHonestly, I hate to admit this but I just lied about where I was traveling to when I was younger, but that was before all the apps and trackers. I was also a good, nerdy kid so I don't think they imagined I'd do such a thing, and really I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nThe likelihood or being injured or worse on a trip is slim but not zero. Letting people know where you are going and when you expect to be there/get back is a good idea.",

Maybe it's an empty threat, but you know your parents best. Even if they don't kick you out, they can make your life miserable in the lead up to the trip and for a long time afterward. \n\nI know it's really frustrating, but if they hold the keys and the money, they make the rules. And no matter how much money you have saved for this one trip, you can't actually afford it unless you can also support yourself fully as an independent adult. If you go on this trip, you'll have to live with them longer as you'll have burned through your current savings. \n\nFocus on saving money and getting a solid job after graduation with good vacation time, and plan more realistic trips in the meantime. If you're in Ireland, there's plenty to see within your own country or in the UK. Plan a solo weekend in Dublin or Cork or London. \n\nAnd also focus on asserting smaller boundaries and decisions. Take other decisions and just do them without running anything by your parents. Get them more used to you acting as an independent adult. That will make things easier as you transition away from being a dependent in their care. And of course, don't apologize for wanting to take the trip. Make it clear that you are acquiescing for purely financial reasons, and that as soon as you can support yourself, they will have zero authority to make decisions for you.",

Mostly it just becomes also part of the next generation, toppled upon who ever else is bought into that family via marriage etc. \nIf these dynamics were explored, confronted, and maybe put under that therapeutic microscope, my feeling is widespread depression would be dealt with at the root cause, instead of bandaid drugs, of all types. \nMaybe not also. \ud83e\udd14",

            "comment": "One thing you could do is to create a shared google doc that outlines your itinerary and give them access to it--I always do this when I travel alone just for possible (and unlikely) safety issues. You can also register your trip with the state dept. This might help reassure them--and it can be useful to you, too, as you'll receive any pertinent updates as well. \n\nAlso, as soon as you arrive in your first destination, get a Euro SIM card asap and  you can be in constant contact with your parents via What's App. You could even plan scheduled phone calls and send regular texts throughout the day to reassure them.\n\nBUT of course the main issue here is your parents' threat. Could you maybe sit down with them and go over/discuss the things above to ascertain if that allays some of their concerns? Esp since you have a HIGHLY detailed itinerary that they'd have access to. And again, registering your trip with the state dept might also help allay some of their concerns.\n\nHope this has a positive resolution with your parents. I personally think spending extended time abroad is one of the best experiences for a young person as it will, pardon the cliche, broaden your horizons and imo, have a lasting effect on how you perceive the world more broadly (politics, etc) as well as deepening your understanding of different cultures and (maybe) their political systems, etc., which, in the end, will make you a more thoughtful, informed, citizen and human being:)",

            "comment": "Psychologist here.  What your parents are threatening is,  and i mean this in the clinical term,  fucked up.  \n\nHere's what you do. First, read the comment that describes what to do depending on whether you're financially dependent on them.  That was solid advice.  \n\nMy advice is how to treat your parents.  Your parents are essentially having a temper tantrum.  So treat them like you would a toddler.  With a combination of combination and ZERO negotiation.  Ignore all the threats when they're emotional.  Only take them serious if they start getting cold and callous.  Just let them have the temper tantrum. Stay calm and cool. The only real negotiations you give them are those that give them zero real control, like \"would you like me to call you to check in on Saturdays or Sundays?\" \n\nAt some point, they might give you shit like \"is this trip so important that you'll destroy your parents!?!?\" \n\nThis is a crucial moment.  Tell them \"mom.  Dad.  I love you. And i would never intentionally hurt you. But you are the ones forcing me to choose between myself and you.  So i ask you,  'are you prepared to cut me off because of a trip\"\n\nSome things to keep in your back pocket to connect with them: \n\n1) what is this really about? \n\n2) this might be a mistake, but it's a mistake i need to make\n\n3) just because I'm doing something you disagree with doesn't mean i don't love you\n\nI'm real sorry your parents are being bullies. But try to have a little bit of empathy. It's possible they're freaking the fuck out because they're not ready to realize they don't own or control your life. What they're doing is fucked up and not cool. But try to view it as a temper tantrum.  And never back down from the FACT that you are going on this trip.  That is happening. Don't let them get their foot in the door on that one.  You are a goddamn adult. Live the life you want to.",

It's potentially still very hot, full of tourists, expensive, very uncomfortable very crowded. Big mistake. You're also attempting to do way too much and visit way too many places. This is the problem of being at the buffet. So many things to eat how do you control not overeating..\n\n\nYour parents have it all wrong though about over control and overthinking of where he will go and where you will stay.. some planning is comforting to start you off but some of the best stuff happens on the fly as you discover.. You may get to a place and absolutely love it and want to stay there a long time and if it's all too planned out it's just going to be a crazy run from one place to another kind of trip.

Maybe instead of going to all those cities, stick to just two or three, and go with those that have a reputation for being very safe. (From your list: Luxembourg, Zurich, and Lugano.) That may help allay their fears that you'll get in trouble.\n\nAnother thing you can do is go solo to a place where you've holidayed as a family in the past. Their familiarity with the destination may help ease their worries. You may not get to visit the places where you want to go, but at least you are traveling solo.\n\nTell them that every single day of your trip, you'll check in twice, morning and evening.\n\nIf they still won't budge, this is a bit silly to suggest, but try sweetening the deal with one of your friends. Basically, get them to go with you, and if finances are the only hinderance, see what you can do to take that out of the equation. Consider paying for their tickets and their lodging. I know, this is turning out to be more expensive for you, BUT you'll be allowed to go and you get to visit all of the cities you want.\n\nBarring this, you just have to decide whether going on this trip is worth the aftermath. If you come home and all your stuff has been left outside your home, will you have a place to stay at for at least three months while you get things sorted out?",

Paris is expensive but if your traveling from far to Europe it's worth it. Luxembourg.... I apologize to Luxembourgians but nobody goes there. It's an expensive city state with banks and bureaucrats. You can replace it with Liege or Koln. \nSimilarly, Switzerland is very expensive for a young traveler. I haven't been though. I've been two times to Austria and can totally recommend Vienna or Salzburg.\nLastly, Venice, it's for couples, it's crowded and even the locals are begging for less tourism.

My family lost their shit when I told them. On and on about my safety, why in the world would I want to go alone, blah blah blah. I booked everything myself, with MY money, but I don\u2019t live with or depend on them for a roof or financially so the permission thing isn\u2019t really a factor for me. Some people are lucky enough to have parents who are well-versed in traveling and \u201cget\u201d it, whereas some parents literally have no idea or desire about traveling so it\u2019s a very foreign thing to them\u2014and therefore scary. It sucks they are trying to take away this really awesome opportunity and experience from you, but like you said it stems from fear. \n\nMy traveling motto is \u201cif not now then when\u201d. You\u2019ve still got a little time to warm them up to the idea, it might help to really emphasize why you want to go, why it\u2019s important to you, the benefits you will get out of it, things you will get to experience, etc. to give them more to simmer on. You could even try to \u201cagree\u201d with them a bit, make sure they know their feelings are validated and heard and how much you would prioritize your safety and how. That\u2019s what I had to do with my fam, and it definitely helped put some ease. They still aren\u2019t fully accepting of it, but less annoying. \n\nWishing you so much luck! &amp; I hope everything works out for you and you get to spend your month in Europe. :)",

My dad threw a fit last year when road tripped across the US by myself and he freaked out again when I told him I\u2019m traveling around Europe this Aug-Oct. honestly, you can\u2019t allow them to stop you. If you look back on your life, you\u2019ll regret that you didn\u2019t do it. \u201cI had the chance to go to Europe when I was in my 20\u2019s but I didn\u2019t because my parents would have been mad at me\u201d, when in reality they\u2019ll be dead and gone by then. Yeah, you will have all the chances to travel in your life but to travel when you\u2019re young, without a partner or kids is so different. Also, the world we live in is uncertain. We could have another pandemic that puts the world on hold for a few years again, or hell, you see the shit going down in Ukraine, World War three could eventually happen and then what?? Take the trip, you won\u2019t regret it",

If you're dependent on them for housing and funds, then I recommend using the money for your trip and use it to move out. It will suck to give up your trip but it's better to get some peace of mind now than later. Whats gonna stop them from threatening to kick you out every single time you want to do something they're not comfortable with? If you're not dependendet on them, then GO! \n\nBut I HIGHLY recommend against following anybody's advice to just go and that your parents will understand. That could just make things worse for you unless you're fully prepared to deal with the consequences.",

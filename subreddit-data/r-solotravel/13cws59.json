    "postText": "I will be traveling from Johannesburg to Nelspruit by private shuttle (most likely CityBug). Once I arrive at Nelspruit, how do I book another shuttle transfer to Skukuza Rest Camp? I have googled for few days and I haven't been able to find any answer.\n\nI will be staying in Skukuza Rest Camp for few days, then most likely travel to Nelspruit again. Might stay a night in Nelspruit then head back to Johannesburg.\n\nMost talk about renting a car, but I am traveling alone, so renting a car when I arrive may not be a viable option due to cost.",

            "comment": "I still think the easiest way is to rent a car. In any case, you could rent a shuttle service (like this [https://www.thulaseats.co.za/shuttle-services/](https://www.thulaseats.co.za/shuttle-services/)) to go to Hazyview and from there join a group excursion for one day and just have them drop you in Skuzuka at the end. Take into account the cost of these two things might not be that much cheaper than renting a car with all that benefits of having the car would bring you. You will also need to talk with the company you go into Skuzuka to pick you up back to Hazyview/Nelspruit, as you will have the same issue.",

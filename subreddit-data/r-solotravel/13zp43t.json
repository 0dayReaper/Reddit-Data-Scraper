    "postText": "I'll be landing in LA, picking up the vehicle there, then my route looks like this:\n\nLA &gt; Joshua Tree &gt; Death Valley &gt; Lake Tahoe &gt; Yosemite &gt; San Francisco &gt; Monterey/Carmel/Big Sur &gt; Santa Barbara &gt; LA.\n\nHere's a map to show exactly the route for each leg of the trip: [Link](https://imgur.com/a/i872fQI)\n\nMy initial plan is to hire a car through Turo, I'm not sure what the roads are like for where I'll be driving and whether something like a Ford Mustang would be suitable for the roads on some parts of the trip, or if it would be better to play it safe and get a reasonably sized SUV.\n\nI'm also a huge petrolhead and love my fast cars, and as this is going to be the solo trip of a lifetime, part of me thinks maybe I should hire a sports car/convertible. With a big chunk of the trip being scenic (The Pacific Coast highway and a lot of driving on the Highway 395 through the Eastern Sierras), I want to make the drive as comfortable but as fun as possible. The total miles I estimate to be around 1500-2000.\n\nMotorhomes/RV's appear to be out of the question as the cheapest option seems to be about $5k for the month, and could make driving in some of the locations a bit difficult/stressful. (SF as an example)\n\nThe two main options I've been considering:\n\n2016 Ford Mustang EcoBoost (approx 26mpg) $1000 for 28 days\n\n2019 Jeep Compass (approx 32mpg) $900 for 28 days\n\nmaybe best of both worlds and rent a SUV in LA that i can use through LA &gt; Joshua Tree &gt; Death Valley &gt; Lake Tahoe &gt; Yosemite and then drop off in San Francisco? Then picking up a sports car/convertible that i can drive through San Francisco &gt; Monterey &gt; Santa Barbara &gt; LA?\n\nI've also listed below the places where I'll be using an airbnb/accommodation and the approximate cost, if anyone has any suggestions for alternatives, or where to avoid or try out I'd appreciate it!\n\nLA 1 night approx $200 (airbnb)\n\nJoshua Tree 3 nights approx $450 (airbnb)\n\nDeath Valley 1 night approx $300 (The Inn Hotel)\n\nLake Tahoe 3 nights approx $1000 (airbnb)\n\nYosemite 3 nights approx $450 (Tent Cabin onsite)\n\nSan Francisco 1 night approx $200 (hotel with secure car parking/airbnb with parking)\n\nCarmel 3 nights approx $1000 (airbnb)\n\nBig Sur 1 night approx $300 (The Madonna Inn)\n\nSanta Barbara 2 nights approx $500 (airbnb)\n\nLA 1 night approx $200 (airbnb)\n\nA huge dump of information I know, but I've never been to the USA and want to make sure I get it right. Thanks for taking the time to read my post!",

Here, we dial 9-1-1.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this because I met some people on a flight last year who were rear-ended on a highway off ramp, and the other driver convinced the travelers (not Americans) that exchanging information was sufficient and no police were called.\n\nThis is NOT how it works. You will need a Police Report to file a claim.\n\nAlso, take pictures immediately - get their license plate number at a minimum.\n\nI hope you have an amazing trip!",

I mean, I could see some guy renting out his car for a few days for $35-40 per day on like Tuesday-Thursday when he doesn't need it... but would the Mustang owner really let it go for a month?\n\nYou'd probably drive the shit out of that car for thousands of miles:D. I'm just not totally sure why anyone would actually let you do that for only $1000.",

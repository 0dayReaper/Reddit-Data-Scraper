    "postText": "Title pretty much says all. I normally leave Google reviews for places I visit in the U.S. Currently I'm visiting Rio and Salvador in Brazil. Recently I went for a massage but I just wanted a normal massage and the therapist seemed to have an attitude and gave a short massage because I wanted to keep it normal and not \"special\" \ud83e\udd23 so I left a review on Google. Later in the night he sent me a whatsapp message saying what I said wasn't true and that he got talked to about the review, how it's the only thing he does so he can get in trouble and maybe lose his job. So I decided to remove the text of the review but left the stars. I don't in anyway want to play with someone's livelihood but when I travel I  do appreciate honest reviews.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm very intrigued by Roamies by Hostelworld, but I'm not sure if it's something for me. As a single and solo traveller, I love discovering new places, take my time and meet people in hostel, but I don't know if Roamies is more geared toward solo travelers would want to party in the night or we need to rush some visits because of time constraint. I don't drink, so I don't want to be with people always going drunk in the bars during the night or talking loudly for no reason. I'm more like an introvert who love meeting interesting people who have a passion for travel and not just tourists if you know what I mean.\n\nDo you have any experience with Roamies?\n\nTell me everything!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you ;)",

(And in places where the social dynamics aren't as easy as a solo traveller). \n\nThere have been some places that I'm keen to do a tour at least in part to avoid the hassle or where there's no really accessible social scene for solo travellers. \n\nBut it does seem like Roamies focuses (likely given the higher demand that comes accoridngly) on trips in places like SE Asia or Central/South America that are generally very well set up for travellers and solo travellers at that.",

It's good for covering a lot of ground in a limited amount of time, and gives you people to travel with if you want to do somewhere like South America.\n\nAs for the group, it's a gamble, but in most instances at least part of the group will probably want to go out at least every 2-3 nights, but there's no requirement to go out with them.",

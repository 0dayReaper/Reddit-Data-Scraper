    "postText": "I feel like in this sub all we hear are people posting at 4am because they have a drunk person snoring that vomited in their room an hour earlier. Then I see people saying things like \"thats why I'll never stay in a hostel.\" We never get to hear about the good experiences that everyone has. Of course every now and then we get a bad roommate but at least in my experience its very rare and for sure it does not outweigh the good. \n\nFor me, my most memorable stay at a hostel was in Seville. We had a salsa class going on around sunset with an orange glow hit the Cathedral in the background. After breaking a sweat and in dire need for some tapas and beer the entire group hit up the tapas bar and we ate, talked, laughed while sipping on the sweet orange Sevillian wine. Once the tapas bar kicked us out we headed to a bar just down the street. A German guy and I saw that they had a beer pong set up and challenged our dance teacher to a game. We played a few more games and had a few more beers. Once we ran out of opponents we stared to take throws matching our steps to the sound of the salsa music going on in the background. It was one of the most amazing nights I've ever had.\n\nI know hostels aren't for everyone and each one has their own way of traveling, but I would hate for people to miss out just because of the horror studies people talk about in this sub.",

Like called an ambulance, went to the pharmacy and watched over me as I was sick and stayed in bed for the day. It was a strange bonding experience with total strangers and I was so happy they were there. Nothing more scary than being suddenly ill in a foreign country.

I love hostels for all their \u2018goods and bads\u2019. Truth is, they\u2019re all good. They\u2019re all experiences in our journey. And isn\u2019t that what we want? To experience",

At that time my only service was wifi in the common area. I had to weather those tragic calls home in a public space. It was really hard but that night new friends ran out for drinks and supplies and rallied around me. We talked for hours sharing stories of our grandparents. It was a great comfort to me and I am so thankful to those people who were there when I was so far from home. Many of them I am still in contact with 10+ years later. We all go through this part of life and are able to be there for each other no matter where we come from.",

I stay at them because i like to meet people when i travel solo and they are more fun, not to mention cheap. It\u2019s part of the experience and you take the bad with the good. \n\nThis being Reddit means that there is an over representation of whiny introverts, tbh. If someone doesn\u2019t like hostels or keeps having bad experiences then yeah, stay at a hotel, but the experience and purpose of a hostel isn\u2019t really comparable. It\u2019s like eating a hamburger and complaining that it\u2019s not healthy. That\u2019s not why you ate the hamburger.",

He didn\u2019t even remember doing it so when the German guy brought a hostel staffer, and he was very confused and angry. I was just happy that I was one bed over. And the hostel was poorly made so high was uphill of him. That was a PARTY hostel in Barcelona, with a 24 bed dorm. I think I might limit myself to 12 beds in the future lmao. \n\n\nGotta apologize for him, I swear not all Californians are like that! We all hate that type of guy too lol",

Some snorers can opt for a private room and/or look into ways to mitigate snoring depending on what ia causing it. No idea if any of these apply to you, but neither do people in your room. I'm sure it sucks being shaken awake and I've personally never done that... but it also sucks not being able to sleep.",

Sadly, this was so long ago that I am not sure if you might have the same experience today if you were to go, but this place will always have a soft spot in our hearts.\n\nThey had a combination of mixed dorm rooms and a few private rooms available, and back then, the prices were incredibly reasonable (looking lately, it looks like they have gone up a LOT). Our friends stayed in the dorms while my wife and I got a private room right next door, and everyone was super respectful, friendly, and full of stories. We loved going to the communal breakfast and dinner areas to chat with the staff and fellow travelers, and we came away with quite a few friends (and great local suggestions)! \n\nWe would go on to invite two of them to stay with us when we got home to the U.S. for attending an event an old company I used to work for would hold every year and another guy we met would end up staying in Japan long-term for studies and we went back to visit him again a few years later. There was also another traveler from Germany who was very kind and on a journey to follow a famous religious trek in northern Japan - and sadly, we did not meet her again since we only overlapped for one night, but her story and journey sounded amazing.\n\nIn the evenings, the hostel employees also spent time hanging out in the front cafe area that was open to the public as well since so many locals would stop by for a drink and chat on their way through the area. We spent a lot of time there in the evenings until the cafe closed and we would wind down after a long day. They offered guests a free drink each night, and then we would stick around to trade stories with locals and play some cards (we always kept a deck of cards on us to play games with anyone interested - easy way to make friends!).\n\nWe stayed at toco. again on the way back home after our journey to the west of Japan and back, and they were eager to hear about our adventures. It was just a blast all around. Though I know the staff had moved on when we visited again years later, the memories remain,\n\nBarring our social experience, the location is also pretty great - tucked away in Taito City, really close to Ueno Park, Asakusa, and the JR lines / metro. On our first trip, our two friends had to run back from Akihabara since the rail lines were halted temporarily due to an earthquake, and it didn't take them very long. It's not right in the thick of the action around areas like Shinjuku or Shibuya, but it's not that hard to get to those areas by JR lines. And the area itself is very calm and relaxing, tucked away in a neighborhood away from the usual tourist madness.\n\nIf you want to check out toco., be sure to book well in advance! I believe they open bookings 3 months ahead, and they used to fill up very quickly!",

However I pay close attention to the reviews and location of the AirBnb.\n\nMy first great experience with a hostel was at the Green Tortoise hostel in Seattle near the Pike Place Market. I was 23 but was still living with my parents and didn't have a job. I took a weekend trip to Seattle to attend an EDM festival there. I was in a shared room with 6 other guys. However for $30 a night and $60 for the weekend, it was a pretty good deal. There was also free breakfast which was awesome.\n\nI visited NYC in December of 2021 and most hotels were easily going over $200 a night. I booked an AirBnb near Williamsburg for around $140 a night and the owner was very friendly. The bedroom was nice and the building the AirBnb was in had a rooftop where I could get a great view of Manhattan which was awesome.",

Creepy because he seemed to know what rooms the women were staying at and mentioned me staying there like he had access to the rooms and keys. Almost an hour later and no word back from the hostel about getting checked in so I start calling other places and leave when I find a bed elsewhere.\n\nI get to the other hostel and one of the employees is hanging out with guests but sees me and quickly goes to open the door for me with a huge smile. Welcoming me. Takes me straight to the check in desk and the woman there right away asks how I\u2019m doing. Oh you\u2019re the person that called, of course let\u2019s get you checked in quickly. The next day I ran into the employee that welcomed me, and he right away said hi and asked how everything was going. Had a few nice chats with other people at the hostel and especially with a group of Brazilians staying in my room. I was booked at another hostel for the rest of my stay so when I left I had to say bye which turned into like an hour of chatting in my horrible Portuguese.",

The hostel itself wasn't particularly nice or fancy in terms of infrastructure and it didn't have the best reputation among the backpacking crowd. We were relatively far from the actual city, but we had a fireplace, the people staying were really diverse in terms of nationalities and we practically had no internet available so we were forced to interact and be creative at spending time together with conversation, meals, parties, and other stuff, especially when raining or when there was no work.\n\nHiro's guesthouse at Koreatown in Japan. Had to literally run a few K's to be able to get in time to check in (had to move out from another hostel) due to the owner (Hiro) going on holiday. Funny enough, we ended up having the entire hostel for ourselves as the guy allowed us to stay last minute and left us with the keys (meaning no other guests were staying since he was indeed leaving the place \"empty\" as he was going on a holiday).\n\nI've stayed in more hostels than I can actually remember and generally speaking, always had positive experiences and left with so many good memories.",

Being there meeting people and making those friends gave me the confidence to leave what had become a pretty shitty relationship, too.  Literally probably wouldn\u2019t be the person I am today without that place. \n\nIMO, the best hostels where you\u2019re least likely to have bad experiences are the smaller ones that cost a little more.  If you can swing it, a $30/night bed at a more \u201cboutique\u201d hostel will save you a lot of trouble and annoyance that comes from staying in a room with 20 people.  They tend to attract a slightly older crowd - think like 22+ instead of a bunch of 18 year olds on a gap year that just want to party hard all the time.",

            "comment": "It was my first time traveling abroad, and I got there 3 days before my friends were meeting me. So I was completely alone. I was in my mid-20s and at a place in my life where I had SOME savings and no job and was starting grad school in a few months. So I was really on a summer vacation in Europe for 6 weeks. \n\nAnyways, my favorite time was in a Barcelona hostel, which was my first stop. Hostel One Paralello was the specific spot. Nothing fancy like a private room. I was just going for it. \n\nSo this place was smaller, and had a person who worked the desk, but basically the common area was like a living room, a kitchen, and an outdoor patio to hang out in. They were so welcoming, and they did \u201cfamily dinner\u201d every night where the person working would cook dinner and everyone staying was invited to eat and drink together. I met so many people, some I\u2019m still in touch with from other countries 10 years later. It was so easy then to coordinate going out that night with people or planning things to do the next day. I still think back fondly to that part of my trip. I even switched my booked hostel to another Hostel One in Prague. Was also a good time but not quite as magical as the Barcelona one.",

            "comment": "In August of 2019, I loaded a bunch of camping gear onto my bicycle and set off to spend the better part of the next seven months riding 5,300 miles (8,500 km) around the western US. I was 20 years old when I started the trip, and it was far and away my biggest solo trip up to that point.\n\nBy early November, I had made it from my home in Wisconsin to Seattle, WA, and stayed at my first ever hostel there before turning south. As Thanksgiving crept closer and closer, it got me thinking about home a lot. The longest I'd ever been away from home on my own before this trip was 20 days, and I was now approaching day 100. Thanksgiving would quickly be followed by Christmas and New Year's, but in my immediate family, there are also three birthdays within 9 days in early December, including what would that year be my 21st. So an already festive time of year was especially so in my family.\n\nWhile staying at my second hostel in Portland, OR, I booked a flight home. The plan was to spend a couple more weeks biking down to Eugene, Oregon, where I'd rent a storage unit to leave the bike while I flew home. I'd see my family for a month, be with them for the birthdays and holidays, and then head back out to continue my travels shortly after New Year's. But I wasn't sure that I'd be able to make it to Eugene before Thanksgiving. I booked the flight for the following Monday or Tuesday, five days before my birthday.\n\nI ended up making it to Eugene the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. I biked all day through a cold rain storm to get there before the rain would turn to snow the following day. I locked the bike outside, and walked in without a reservation. Looking like a dog just pulled me out of a lake, I asked the guy at the front desk if they had any rooms available for the next week, and he quickly got me set up in a small dorm.\n\nThe hostel was small. And quiet. In my six bed dorm, there was me and one other guy. Although roommates came and went over my week there, there was never more than two of us. But honestly, that was exactly what I needed at that point in my travels. I was in a weird emotional state, and I just needed some time to process the thought of going back to familiar faces after three and a half months on my own.\n\nActually, I say the hostel was quiet, but there was one big exception to that. The evening of Thanksgiving. Every hostel employee, regardless of whether they were on the clock that day, came for dinner, along with some friends of the staff. I think there was maybe one other actual hostel guest there that night, if that. It was my first ever big holiday away from my friends and family, but if I couldn't be home, that hostel was the next best place. The staff really seemed to love each other, and they welcomed me into their little family with open arms. Late into the evening, the room was full of laughter as we ate a delicious potluck dinner with all the traditional Thanksgiving offerings. I went to bed that night not just with a full stomach but a full heart and soul as well, and I'd all but forgotten about the weird flavor of sadness I'd felt earlier that very day thinking about my loved ones around the dinner table back home.\n\nI'm never a party hostel type of guy, but I do enjoy a social hostel, hanging out in the common areas talking with people from all around the world. The Eugene Lodge and International Hostel fell quite a ways short of even that, as oftentimes the only people around to socialize with were the staff. But it was exactly what I needed at that chapter of my travels, and I will forever cherish my time there.\n\n**TL;DR** My first ever major holiday away from my family occurred three and a half months into a trip shortly before my 21st birthday. I spent that Thanksgiving at a quiet hostel in Eugene, Oregon, where the hostel staff and some friends of theirs welcomed me into their Thanksgiving dinner. For that one evening, it genuinely felt like I was a part of their family, which really helped me through a weird emotional state.",

I know this is super common but to have every person in my room all go out together and just have the most amazing time was just so special.

Probably because any time I'm staying at a hostel, if I'm in the dorm sleeping I'm probably so drunk nothing would wake me up. If I need a good sober nights sleep I'll book a private. I think if you're complaining about noise is a dorm, you shouldn't have booked a dorm. \n\nBest experiences: Bucharest, the most amazing hostel for only 10 quid a night and spending the night pub hopping after amazing food in the common area\n\nEdinburgh, so fun playing beer pong then pub crawling and waking up not even remembering how I got back but managed it somehow\n\nMarseille, met a bunch of brits and ended with the boys arm wrestling with the losers all making out. Absolutely hilarious.  \n\nBelfast, meeting two of the coolest girls and having such a good chat all night over a bottle of wine. Had been going through a tough time and that night genuinely helped me so much, healed my soul a bit\n\nMadrid, met some cool aussies and had an amazing time clubbing, made it back at 7am just in time for my early morning train, which was less fun",

Most others around my age are in groups and want to keep to themselves are simply not social at all.  \nThe one good experience I had was in Venice, not a hostel but an Airbnb with 6 single beds in a large room, so the feeling was a bit different. There was a group of three travellers, early 30s, and we got talking and went out. I was supposed to leave the following morning, but changed things to spend it with them, was one of the highlights of my trip to Italy. They didn't speak English either, so was a good opportunity to speak Italian too",

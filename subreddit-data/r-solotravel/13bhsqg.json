    "postText": "I\u2019m not sure why but I found it super hard getting around Carcassonne on public transport. I really enjoyed the city and would love to come back, the only stressful part of it all was public transport.\n\nTLDR: taxi company confirmed my pick up reservation the day before, then never showed up and told me the reservation didn\u2019t exist (before my flight home, so big stress). Followed bus timetables online but then told by locals buses weren\u2019t running. Google Maps has no public transport info for the city, and couldn\u2019t find bus stop locations. \n\nIn advance, this post is not a complaint, more so a heads up to other travellers that no matter how organised and confident you may feel about your trip - it\u2019s worth allowing extra time for getting around just incase of things not going to plan. At least when I come back again I will have a better understanding of how to get around (I hope). \n\nI tried to plan my trip well in advance, and when using google maps - whenever I tried to go from one area to another in the city, the maps was saying there was no public transport options. I could only drive/walk/cycle. Even for getting between the airport and city centre it wasn\u2019t showing any shuttle or bus options. As my plane was due to land around 3pm, I accepted that maybe the 40min walk would be fine, so I factored this into my plan. But as soon as I left the airport there was a shuttle bus outside, so I paid to get on that. \n\nAs for a short trip to Lac de la Cavay\u00e8re, when planning this part of the weekend - again maps was saying there was no public transport. I was going to look into it further but I had seen bike rental and thought as the weather was going to be nice this would be a more enjoyable way to get there. On the day I was super tired and had found out I should be able to get a bus there anyway after all. I followed a few online timetables, they showed what bus number I needed to get and what time it departed the bus stops on the route. But when putting the bus stops into maps, they weren\u2019t showing up. So I got very lost trying to find the actual stop to wait at. I went to the nearest bus stop and asked 2 lovely local women if they\u2019d be able to point me in the right direction for the stop. I finally made it to my stop, and when the bus turned up (line 2) I asked if it was going near Lac de la Cavay\u00e8re and the driver shook his head no. I got off the bus and looked evidently confused, he then signalled me to get back on - which I did and then once we got to a stop right by the lake he gave me a nod to say get off here. I thought maybe he just made an exception and went this way but there was a huge bunch of people waiting at that stop who got on the bus and surely he can\u2019t just change the bus route for one person. So I\u2019m unsure why he said he wasn\u2019t going there at first. \n\nBefore I went to the lake, I checked and double checked when the last running buses back to Carcassonne were. I had an alarm on my phone for 45 mins before the last bus time to make sure I left with plenty of time for anything that could go wrong. I got a little bit lost again and couldn\u2019t see the nearest stop, so I asked locals again. They told me no buses were running. I enjoyed my swim in the lake so much that I wasn\u2019t really very stressed about this, I accepted my fate and begun the 1.5 hour walk back to the city, but a very kind lady and her dog had heard my conversation with the locals before and stopped when she drove past me on my way. She dropped me off at the Carcassonne exit of the highway toward the city. (If you\u2019re out there and see this - thank you so much again! You turned my 1hr30min walk into 20min) \n\nThe most stressful part of getting around for me was the morning of my flight. I like to get to the airport at least 2 hours before my flight, especially when I don\u2019t know what that airport is like/how busy it can get. Reviews online were saying bad things about Carcassonne airport and how slow security was, so I definitely wanted to be there early. I found a timetable for the shuttle bus, but the earliest bus was 1ish hour before the flight. The night before, I called Allo Taxi, and pre booked a cab for 3 hours before flight departure to leave room for any mishaps. I booked it from the train station for 7am. I walked from my air b&amp;b to the train station (20mins), and no taxi showed up. I tried to call them but my roaming plan expired minutes before, and the train station seemed pretty closed down with no staff (I assume because it was early), meaning the WiFi wasn\u2019t available. So I couldn\u2019t get online to buy another roaming plan. I tried my best to ask a few people around the train station if I could use their phone to call the taxi rank but I don\u2019t think they could understand my broken-half-English-half-French. A cleaner working at the station was trying to tell me taxis were not in operation, as did two other people the cleaner was talking to. At this point it was 2.5 hours before my flight and I was stressed about not being able to get to the airport. I speed walked back to my air b&amp;b and connected to the WiFi, we\u2019re coming up to 2hrs before my flight now. I bought a new roaming plan and called the taxi rank. I told them I had pre-booked a taxi from the train station for 7am and they said no such reservation existed and were not trying to offer a solution. The person on the phone was a driver on shift with English speaking customers in his car who were trying to help me (thank you also if you see this). They tried to get the driver to pick me up in their cab as they were going to the airport, but he said not possible. It wasn\u2019t until I felt completely exhausted and hopeless, and begun to cry that he gave me a solution. He sent another driver to me and I finally made it to the airport.",

Even though rental cars are a pricier option, south of France is not a place for budget travel anyway. We had a rental car and were able to pop in and out seamlessly through multiple small towns/villages.",

It\u2019s better when you\u2019re on a trip with other people as you can all split the cost - I did this on a trip to Norway with 3 other people. But being on a solo trip I just couldn\u2019t afford it at all. I had budgeted for one expensive taxi should I need it in an emergency situation or for instance getting to the airport for my flight home",

            "comment": "If I don't speak the local language and transport is kind of unpredictable, I make sure to get a local sim card and get a short-term plan. I like wandering around and getting lost as much as the next guy, but when you absolutely need to be somewhere at a certain time, being able to use the internet to find and translate stuff is kind of priceless (ok, not really, but definitely worth some euros). If I'm traveling solo, I'm extra particular about this, for safety reasons.\n\nGood job surviving that though! Hopefully the next trip will be easier. And thanks for sharing info!",

Google maps had no info regarding public transport for the city and the online timetable I followed turned out to be incorrect. I had to keep showing the locals my phone with the timetable and stops to manoeuvre around and get a vague sense of direction. Very true the next trip I hope is much easier haha!",

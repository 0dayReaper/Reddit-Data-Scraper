    "postText": "Introduction: Mexico City has been a recent interest of mine ever since the YouTube algorithm started recommending me videos on this mega city. Like most Americans, I was ignorant and incorrectly under the assumption that Mexico City was sketchy and had nothing to offer for travelers other than poverty tourism. However, after watching YouTube videos and reading more about this city, I quickly learned that Mexico City, and Mexico in general, has a very rich culture and history. It also is the biggest city in the Western Hemisphere. I was locked in this point to explore this city so close to home.Booking this trip was very random, I originally booked a vacation to go to EDC Vegas with friends (insanely fun time btw) but I wanted to extend my PTO for the rest of the week after because I was already taking a day off to rest and had the Friday off for MDW.  \nAfter exploring other options in the US like possibly other areas in the south west like Utah or Arizona I quickly realized how expensive this would be. Vegas has great prices on flights so I wanted to take advantage of that and go somewhere international, due to my recent interest with Mexico City and how it isn\u2019t too expensive, it just made sense. I booked the flight and hotel instantly so I wouldn\u2019t think too much about it.\n\n  \nI invited some other friends at first and received some maybes, ultimately I knew that this would end up being a solo trip. I have some experience with solo trips, my first one was Hiroshima while I was studying abroad in Tokyo, that trip gave me my first powerful global experience that has ultimately became my goal when i travel now. I also did Denver last summer to see a red rocks show ( stayed in a hostel which ended up being the same price as a decent hotel in CDMX \ud83e\udd23). I didn\u2019t have much of a structured plan for this trip except to see the historic district and maybe teohiucan if it wasn\u2019t too difficult to get there.\n\n  \nLogistics: I stayed in a Roma Norte hotel from Tuesday Night - Sunday Morning.\n\n  \nInterests: architecture, food, electronic music, nature, history\n\n  \nDay 1: Arrival\n\n  \nI arrived into CDMX around 1045pm via Volaris. The Volaris experience sucks, honestly worse than Spirit lol. For about an hour we were sitting on the runway not moving without AC in the Vegas heat. Apparently this is due to them not having runway rights? Not sure about this but that\u2019s what some googling told me.\n\n  \nFor some reason I exchanged usd for pesos at the cash exchange counters instead of using an atm to take out pesos. Not sure why I did because I have travelled internationally and know that ATMs are usually the best options. Whatever, I just took the L there. I called an Uber to my hotel after rejecting many taxi drivers.\n\n  \nI arrived to my hotel hungry and looked for open places to eat that were close to the hotel. I did not want to walk too far as I heard that night time gets sketchy. I ended up finding a taco place right across the street from my hotel so I went there. The place was called Taquer\u00eda LOS HUARACHINES (ROMA). Ordering was a bit tough due to the language barrier but I got 2 Al pastor tacos, a plate of carne asada with about 5 tortilla, and a Coca Cola. This was an amazing meal and  exactly what I wanted. The Al pastor was incredibly juicy and probably were the best tacos I had in my life at this point. I\u2019m currently based in Texas so I\u2019ve had real tacos before but these were just something else. I walked back to my hotel and quickly went to bed.\n\n  \nDay 2: Roma Norte &amp; La Condesa\n\n  \nI had no official plans for this day. I was still tired from EDC Vegas so I woke up pretty late and didn\u2019t get out of the hotel until around 1130-12. Once I did get out, I originally just planned to walk around neighborhood and see what piqued my interest. I started with a coffee. I got an iced coffee as it was hot out, I don\u2019t think iced coffee is a thing anywhere else besides the US so this was also a little harder to order due to language barrier. Luckily someone spoke English at the counter and helped me order.\n\n  \nI began to walk north, I stopped at plaza rio de janiero to smoke a cigarette (I\u2019m not a regular smoker except on vacation and when I go to raves lol). Very cool spot. My first impression of the Roma Norte neighborhood was that it was a nicer, greener, cleaner version of nyc with a European flair.\n\n  \nNext, I ended up at I believe Zona Rosa? It was a pedestrian only area with a lot of shops and restaurants. I stopped in a few shops maybe looking to buy sunglasses or a shirt but ultimately did not. I continued my walk.\n\n  \nI saw there was some sort of park near me called Bosque de Chapultec. I decided that would be my next destination to walk to. I passed the el Angel de la indepencia which was very impressive. I finally got to the park and was wowed by how nice it was. I didn\u2019t know it was such a big destination until I got there and saw there a bunch of museos and vendors set up. I bought a pair of sunglasses as it was bright out and walked around a bit to take it in. Finally, I decided to check out a museum. I chose Museo de Arte Moderno as I wanted to see some art. I much prefer modern art over traditional art too. I really liked this museum and connected with a lot more paintings that I thought I would. About of 1/4 of the way through I realized can use Google translate to read the descriptions for some of the paintings. I wish I took down the artists who created some of these paintings but I think I can find the artists again if I really wanted to.  \nI went outside to the sculpture garden and this was a little underwhelming tbh. I was also getting hangry so I went through it quick. \n\nI decided to get lunch at Los Pancheros as it was nearby and the Google reviews seemed good. I ordered Plato rachero &amp; caldo xochitl. HUGE portions and incredibly good. I really liked the soup though, it was some sort of chicken and rice soup. It took a little bit for the check to come but it finally did and I paid and left.\n\n  \nI ate way too much and I had to lay down somewhere so I went back to the park and found a nice place to lay where other people were. It was some sort of fountain that I can\u2019t find on Google maps but even though it wasn\u2019t exactly \u201cgrand\u201d it was very chill and everyone there just seemed relaxed lol. I laid there for about 20-30 mins until I was ready to go again. I saw on Google maps that there was a castle in the park!? I really wanted to see that. I decided to walk in that direction and also passed Lago de Chapultec. Wow that was beautiful, I wish I took my rest time there lol.\n\n  \nI finally got to the castle entrance but they weren\u2019t letting people in anymore as it was too late, damn. I should\u2019ve paid more attention to the times, I didn\u2019t realize all the museums closed at 5. I decided to finish up my park experience and Uber to the historic center just to check it out. However Ubers were very hard to get at this time as it was rush hour and traffic was insane outside the park. I had multiple people cancel on me, I also canceled on someone after seeing how long it would take to pick me up and drop me off to the historic center. I eventually decided just to walk back. It was about an hour walk back so I had to tough it out.\n\n  \nNot much happened on this walk, just continued to take in the city. Stopped at glorieta de Los insugentes to take a break and smoke a cigarette. I felt a little sketched out here due to all the people constantly moving. I was a bit worried about being pick pocketed but I think it was just the tiredness making me anxious. I got out of there relatively quick and made it back to my hotel to rest before dinner.\n\n  \nAt this point I decided I wanted to go to teohiucan the next day. I explored my options for getting there and eventually just decided on Uber because I don\u2019t really like being in a group when going to tourist sites as I\u2019m a bit \u201cquirky\u201d and like to take weird routes and repeat some areas a few times I also keep an inconsistent pace so that made the group experience out of the question. I could\u2019ve taken the bus but did not want to deal with the stress that public transit can be in a foreign country lol. For dinner, I made a reservation at the sushi place Makoto as I wanted something other than Mexican food. Fabulous place, I ordered a glass of wine, sushi sampler, and the fatty tuna nigiri.  \n\n\nDay 2: Teohiucan\n\n  \nI woke up somewhat early for this day. I ordered an Uber and was off. It was really interesting to see Mexico City outside the nicer neighborhoods. I think this is what most Americans imagine when they hear Mexico City. It looked like the COD MW2 map Favela. I wondered what life was like in this area of Mexico City. I even saw a ski lift in use to bring people up the mountain to their house maybe?\n\n  \nI got dropped off at Teohiucan and entered in. I skipped breakfast because I assumed they would have something there. I was half right, they had some convenient stores. I just bought a pack of crackers and a electrolit and hoped that would get me through the whole time I was there lol.I walked around all the pyramids, I was hoping to climb them but I saw they were closed for climbing, honestly a good thing, I imagine they were getting a lot of wear and tear from that. I feel like these pyramids are underrated in terms of world wonders. They\u2019re pretty big and the city itself was apparently one of the biggest cities in the world at the time.\n\n  \nMy favorite part about this visit was this path that you can take that allowed you to walk on the outside of the main path. It was super peaceful and you got to see the pyramids at different angles with no people around. In terms of my favorite structure, I liked the citadel a lot due to the intricate designs on it. Some random things I liked there were the jardin and the things the vendors were selling that made the animal noises \ud83d\ude02 I thought it was hilarious how everyone was basically spamming it in chat. I should\u2019ve bought one looking back\n\n  \nI was a little anxious about getting an Uber back but I got one relatively quick and got back to my hotel. When I got back I was very hungry and I found this place near my hotel with a deal that gave 5 al pastor tacos and a cervesa for $100 pesos. Amazing deal but then I saw the al pastor looked like it was dry and has been out for awhile. Unfortunately i felt too awkward to leave after sitting, a mistake that I learned from later if you keep reading. However the tacos were still decent. I was still pretty hungry and found a street vendor selling hamburgers, I ordered con queso and it was insanely good. I ate it in a park and then got some churros from Churrer\u00eda El Moro which were also good.\n\nAgain I was way too full and had to lie down. I went back to my hotel and took a nap.  \nWhen I woke up I was still full but I started experiencing the first signs of montezumas revenge. However it didn\u2019t seem that bad and I wanted to go out for a rooftop drink. \n\nI went to Supra Roma. Great vibe. I had to  stand by the bar the whole time due to not having reservations but the views were fantastic and the dj was decent too. She was playing house music. I definitely want to bring my friends here if they ever want to come to cdmx. I had 1 cocktail and 2 beers there. Was thinking about talking to people there but mostly everyone was speaking Spanish so I decided not to.\n\n  \nI left and was gonna call it an early night but heard some more house music being played across the street at departmento. I decided why not and paid the cover to check it out. It was ok. Dj was decent but the vibe seemed kind of \u201cbasic\u201d other than the music. Nothing too unique about this place, just a terrace playing music with young people hanging out. I had 2 drinks and left and got a torta. \n\nI made it back to my hotel around 12am and this when things started to go south unfortunately. Montezumas revenge came back and this time even stronger than earlier. The alcohol definitely did not help. It quickly kept getting worse in terms of cramping and the ability to not go to the bathroom for more than 20 mins. I think it was the Al pastor tacos from earlier today. I did not get much sleep this night and was basically in survival mode lol luckily I had some water bottles to stay hydrated but I knew I would have to venture out to get more eventually. I basically spent the whole night on the toilet or curled up in pain.\n\n  \nDay 3: Recovery\n\n  \nI was hoping I\u2019d feel feel better in the morning and I was somewhat correct. After 12 hours I could walk again although it was definitely difficult. I managed to make it to a farmacia where the pharmacist recommended me treda. I got that and more water + electrolit. It was around 1pm so I sat outside and drank my electrolit to see if I strong enough to do some sort of activity. After about 20 mins of sitting outside I decided I definitely could not and decided to just take the L for today so I could be full strength for tomorrow. I took my treda and was able to get some rest. When I woke up I was still feeling montezumas revenge a little bit but I knew I had to eat something. I ended up using Uber eats to get consom\u00e9 de pollo from this place called Toks. It seemed like a safe option as it looked like a chain and I assumed chains usually have somewhat good hygiene standards. It ended up being way better than expected and I managed to put down most of it.\n\n  \nAfter eating, I took a walk to get more electrolit. I was still a little weak so I just went back to the hotel and went to bed. I was a bit bummed I lost a day but anytime you\u2019re in a 3rd world country you should budget a day for stomach issues.\n\n  \nDay 4: Castillo De Chapultepec &amp; Historic Center\n\n  \nI woke up feeling a lot better. It was actually crazy as 24 hours ago I couldn\u2019t even walk straight. I took my treda and headed out. I was debating on if I should go back Chapultepec park to see the castle or if it would take too much time as I was planning to go to the historic center today. I decided to see the castle as I was thinking about it too much to skip it.\n\n  \nI took an Uber there this time and paid the admission. It was definitely worth it. The castle was so beautiful and there was so much history inside. I learned a lot about Mexican history and was able to take in some nice views of the city. My favorite part were the murals inside and the jardin. After, I walked to 7/11 to get more electrolit. I also got pringles as I was hungry but my stomach was still a little rough. From there I ubered to the historic center.\n\n  \nWhen I got to the historic center I was instantly overstimulated lol. It was a Saturday afternoon so it must\u2019ve been the most popular day. It was a lot bigger than expected too. I didn\u2019t really know where to start so I just started walking. My first stop was actually the adidas store as I needed to get my bearings and am a fan of adidas lol unfortunately there wasn\u2019t much in there though that seemed exclusive. I know in Tokyo they\u2019ll have exclusive stuff but didn\u2019t see anything like that in Mexico City, bit disappointed but otherwise it provided a place for me to take a breath. I got out and started walking towards zocalo plaza.\n\n  \nZocalo Plaza was just epic. The big Mexican flag with the cathedral behind it had so much swag for lack of a better term lmao it showed off the immense pride that Mexico has for itself. I really liked this area a lot.\n\n  \nI continued walking and ended up at these streets with vendors. This was even more overstimulating than the other areas. So much noise and people. I stopped in a store and got a can coke and kept on trucking along.\n\n  \nI decided to go to palacio de bella artes. I really liked palacio de bella artes as well. The architecture and colors were stunning. The Torre Latinoamericana building was also interesting. I decided to check out the museum inside palacio de Bella artes. At first i thought it was a bit underwhelming. I was not too big of a fan of the murals and it seemed like some areas were closed. I then came across the Dioses y Maquinas exhibit by Santiago Sierra Soler. This exhibit was an \u201cimmersive cinema installation\u201d that told the story of the aztecs getting colonized by Spaniards. It was very powerful and really made me understand some of the politics of Mexico. Also globalism in general and how colonization impacted the world. It gave me that powerful global experience that I mentioned before. I think everyone who visits cdmx should experience this exhibit to really wrap your head around the politics of the country and how it became what it is today. When I walked out I began to see the two sides of Mexico, the native side and european side and how they interact with each other.\n\n  \nThat exhibit made me want to learn about the Aztecs more so I ended up going to museo del templo mayor. This place was also impressive with countless exhibits about the Aztecs. It\u2019s insane to me how there was an ancient city right under us. By the time I was done there I was getting hungry so ironically I got McDonald\u2019s as my stomach needed something familiar. I got it to go and ate it near the palacio de bella artes. I wanted to go the sears rooftop after but couldn\u2019t find the entrance so I just walked around the surrounding neighborhood. This part reminded me a lot of Manhattan. \n\n  \nI walked through the Barrio Chino and thought it was hilarious tbh. I did not see any Asian people and there wasn\u2019t much Asian culture other than the lanterns i guess lol the restaurants also did not look too good. Cool experience nonetheless.  \nI ended my walk at a plaza San juan to call an Uber as it was about to start raining. I found the torre de telefons de Telmex structure also super interesting. I made it home and rested before dinner.\n\n  \nFor dinner I went to this Argentinan steak house called Gardela. A bit risky after my stomach issues but I wanted to get a nice dinner on my last night. I got a dry aged New York strip and it did not disappoint. I ordered it medium rare but it was a bit more rare than expected. I ate it anyway and was wowed. One of the best steaks I\u2019ve ever had. Amazing service too, can\u2019t recommend this place enough if you want a good steak.\n\n  \nWhen I got back to my hotel I was having an internal debate if I should go out. I had an early flight and was already pretty tired and full. I decided to go out anyway as it was Saturday night and didn\u2019t get to do anything the day before. I ended up at this techno club called yuyu. Pretty intimate spot. The techno was very good and creative. The crowd was also fun, I had a few shallow conversations with people but nothing deep. Mostly my fault though as I wasn\u2019t making much conversation. I just drank beer, smoked cigarettes, and listened to good electronic music which is a solid night for me. I headed home around 2 and went to bed for my flight.\n\n  \nClosing remarks:\n\nI really enjoyed my time in Mexico City. Im not sure what my expectations were for the city but they were definitely exceeded. Definitely an underrated city as there is so much culture and history but I never here much people talk about it in the states. I will definitely be back as I feel like there\u2019s still so much to discover and it was pretty cheap to get there and get lodging.  \nNot gonna lie though, I was bit nervous going solo here but once I got there most of the anxiety went away. In terms of safety, just be where you\u2019re supposed to be (tourist areas &amp; safe neighborhoods), keep your possessions zipped up, and don\u2019t walk at night. I felt more sketched out in most US cities",

I liked gdl but honestly it was because i speak Spanish and was able to make some friends at the bar who invited me to hang out with them haha. Love Mexico. Lived in Chiapas for 2 years. Wonderful country, despite it's flaws",

With regards to getting sick, did you wash your hands (or use hand sanitizer) every time before you ate anything? \n\n90+% of the time this is the reason you get sick when in Mexico, it's not from the food itself. You're touching everything and then using your dirty hands to put the tacos into your mouth. I've spent months and months cumulatively traveling all over Mexico (from little villages to big cities) and making sure I always wash/sanitize my hands before eating is why I've never gotten sick. You'll also notice most Mexican people going over and washing their hands when they get to a food stand or restaurant for the same reason. \n\nMexico is one of my favorite countries in the world. Glad you enjoyed it.",

Trying to keep my Osprey Farpoint 40-ltr pack light and portable. I've worn All-Birds a couple times and took Olekai on my recent trip to Australia. My trips are mostly urban with lots of walking (20K steps per day average). Fellow solo travelers, what do you recommend?",

They\u2019re breathable but somehow still reasonably warm if you need them to be and the pair I have are waterproof which is huge if you step in a puddle and only have the one pair of shoes. They\u2019re also extremely comfortable and the hiking boot soles make them well suited for both walking around a city and light hiking to moderate trail hiking.\n\nThe one drawback is they are not exactly the most attractive shoes on the market. You pretty much look like you\u2019re walking around in a pair of hiking boots all day.",

I've never met a person who didn't use socks who's shoes didn't smell like bad gorgonzola from the other side of the room. Also when I've found myself with no other options than to go sockless in the same pair of shoes for a few days, I have to wash the shoes after because they're just too stinky after just those few days. \n\nIs there a tiny tiny population of people who don't get sweaty feet like, ever? Or do you just not care about the smell?",

                            "comment": "I have been using Vessi's for over a year now to travel regularly. Specifically the weekend sneaker because it looks more casual unlike a lot of their other models.\n\nPros:\n\n-the waterproofing is legit. I stood in 2 inches of water in my bathtub when I first got them as a test and my feet stayed completely dry. Since then I've used them to walk through rainstorms, stepped in puddles, trudged through mud, and crossed streams with no wetness in my shoe. Basically, as long as you keep the water level below the ankle your foot will stay dry\n\n-as mentioned above, it can handle mud and dirt pretty well which makes it usable for some light hiking if you like to do nature stuff on your travels\n\n-pretty comfortable to walk around all day, I've pulled 14 hours of walking around being a tourist and have felt fine afterwards\n\n-very breathable, I wear socks and my feet don't get hot when I'm going around tropical climates\n\n-yet can be pretty warm too if you add some thicker socks for a cold environment\n\n-it's pretty easy to find a 20% off coupon on YouTube since they advertise a lot with creators\n\nCons:\n\n-while the weekend sneaker looks less sporty than other models, it's not the most \"fashionable\" shoe. You won't get away wearing it to a formal event. I wish they removed the checkered pattern and just made them a solid color. But it's passable in most situations, especially the black and white models\n\n-it's fine to walk around in for hours if you're taking regular breaks, not so much if you'll be standing for hours. I wore them to a rainy music festival once where we stood for around 8 hours with only a couple breaks and my calves were killing me at the end\n\n-they use a \"sock like\" design or a soft exterior which means they don't provide a lot of support on bumpy ground and you can easily end up bending your foot a lot. I wore them on a 2 months stint I did through central America in a lot of towns that had cobblestone roads. I had to catch myself a lot because I'd accidentally step in between two stone and my foot would bend in the shoe since it's soft (edit: this is my greatest complaint for reference)\n\n-despite what the advertisements claim, they can only handle light hiking on well maintained trails. If you're going to do something more intense or on bumpy ground then Vessi's will not cut it, you will need actual hiking shoes\n\n-they don't have the best traction when it gets icy and slippery so if you're going somewhere that you know it will snow or ice a lot while you're there then you should consider another shoe \n\nOverall, I would recommend them as a go to travel shoe but definitely keep the limitations I mentioned in mind. If they ever made a hard shell shoe with the same waterproofing and breathability I'd immediately get it but alas I do with what they provide",

They have a lot of different styles catered to different needs so it's best to try em all on, maybe do a gait analysis at a running store to find out if you over pronate or over supinate. I over pronate and the hoka gaviotas are the only sneakers I've ever worn that don't necessitate a fancy corrective insole for me. If you have pain in one specific part of your foot after a ton of walking then you likely have a gait problem (or the shoes you're wearing just suck)\n\nThe no socks thing though... why not just get two pairs of wool socks (quick drying, more durable, don't stay sweaty) and rotate between em? You can wash the pair you just wore in the sink and let em dry while you sleep. I personally can't understand people who don't wear socks with sneakers but that's me. It's like going commando but for your feet. Unless you're a sandal guy (hoka does make some very sneaker-like sandals!) In which case fine lol\n\nhttps://www.hoka.com/en/us/mens-sandals/hopara/195719186241.html?source=shoppingsite_PLA_1106534-CTHY-10.5&amp;kpid=1106534-CTHY-10.5&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=pla&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwjYKjBhB5EiwAiFdSfvUiz-duXVR4h-Lg7toCIGmnT-CZkO7oOWyVi31kphpjZqC7Co9RrBoCEWgQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds",

The cliftons are probably the least supportive/most neutral of the 3 but I have kind of stupid feet so that is probably just because my feet NEED a lot of very specific support and gait correction. But I would also bet a lot of people don't realize they have gait issues that need correcting - until I was about 22 I just thought it was normal for my feet to be in severe pain particularly in my big toes and ball of my foot if I was on my feet all day. Ya know, cause people complain their feet hurt after walking all day. It's normal for your feet to just be a little sore, it's not normal for specific parts of your feet to be in a lot of pain. So if that's ever the case, you have a gait issue OR you are wearing the wrong shoes for your feet (or both). Most commonly, if you over-pronate, you'd feel the issues I described - the front and inner parts of your feet will hurt. If you over-supinate, you will feel pain in your ankles and pinky toes/outer side of your feet.\n\nHoka arahi is the other stability sneaker that hoka makes, it's just slightly less aggressive in its corrective/stability stuff compared to the gaviota, so perhaps worth trying too  \n\n\nOn cloud also makes a stability sneaker, called the cloudflyer. My company just gave me an on-cloud sneakers gift card as a nurses week gift, so I just ordered a pair of those to try out - They are more expensive than the hokas though, I would not have bought one if I didn't just get a gift card for them, BUT on-cloud fans are like a cult, so they probably don't suck. Might also be worth considering!",

They're the best brand and better than Chaco sandals in my opinion. The XLT2 is my favorite since it offers more support than a foam based sandal with better tread as well. Someone mentioned Bedrock sandals which are good too because of the Vibram sole design. \n\nCasual sneakers: I like All birds because they're lightweight and easy to pack. I also find them very comfortable. The wool runner mizzle is my recommendation because it's water resistant, has extra grip for tread, and looks pretty minimalist/stylish. I walked around Spain, Portugal, and France with only a pair of those in January and they were great. Some other shout outs are the Hoka Mach 5, the New Balance fresh foam, Brooks adrenaline, and Altra lone peak if you want a trail runner with better grip. \n\nFor backpacking: Zamberlan has some pretty good backpacking boots but they're very heavy and expensive. We sell some to folks going to do the AT, the Camino, or some other big trek. Honestly an Oboz Sawtooth mid is fine for backpacking/hiking. The Nucleo high by La Sportiva is also a good back packing boot.",

Over in the r/hiking and r/backpacking subs, a lot of people swear by Oboz, which are painful for me, while I really like Keens, which are equally painful for a lot of folks. I mention both though because both offer styles that are a little dressier than most hiking shoes or trail runners while also offering a lot of support and durability. \n\nI wear the Keen Austin for work right now and regularly walk 15k to 20k steps a day. I\u2019ve worn similar Keen styles while traveling in the past, including a month in Europe with lots of urban walking, plus some trail walking in the alps, and thought they worked perfectly. One thing I will say though is that they definitely benefit from a better insole insert than what they come with. If you\u2019re hitting 20k+ days regularly, you\u2019ll benefit from an orthotic insole.",

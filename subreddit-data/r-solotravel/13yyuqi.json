    "postText": "Imagine the following situation.\n\nI tell someone next week I go on vacation to Sweden.\nThe person asks who I take with me. I shrugh and say \"I travel alone\"\n\nThen the same discussin starts over every time. Some people really seam to have a problem with the fact that I travel solo.\n\nTraveling solo for me is a personel desicion. There's nothing better then waking up in your destination and you can do whatever you want.\n\nI love strolling arround a new city. Usually I have some special attraction in mind but then I find two or three other interesing things\n\nThe second reason is it boosts my confidence. Every vacation has it's own problems and I need to solve them. \n\nTravelling alone is not the same as beeing alone. So I always have someone in my family caring for my cats\n\nThe downside for me is the 24 hours before departure where I reall feel thar I'm leaving my comfort zone right now. Usually this ends when I reach my gate at the airport. \n\nUsually when people have a problem with me travelling alone I express my reasons cleary. And still they don't seem to understand it.I can say whatever you want they stilll seem to think it's arkward.\n\nHow do you handle people like this and why do they have such a problem with solo travellers?",

Mutual friend was sick so my friend decided to go and get her some oranges to make her feel better. She went to the super market on her own and brought back oranges.

Are you sure you won\u2019t get lost?\u201d but once I successfully finished my first solo trip all these questions stopped.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why you want people to understand your reason for traveling solo though. Are you trying to argue with them that solo traveling is superior to other kinds of traveling? Because I can\u2019t imagine having a lengthy conversation where I\u2019m trying to express my reasons for solo traveling. Normally for me it goes like this: \u201cwow you travel alone? why?\u201d \u2014 \u201cbecause I like traveling alone and I hate traveling with my friends\u201d \u2014 \u201coh okay\u201d.

It is also a very freeing experience, because you are forced to rely on yourself and yourself alone, increasing your ability to problem-solve, plan, and introspect.",

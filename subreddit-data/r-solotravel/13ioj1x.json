    "postText": "Chiang Mai to Bangkok. They started boarding at 5:45am. We were in the air around 6:15. Flight was scheduled to leave at 6:35am.\n\nMy theory is that they knew \"it was okay to leave early\" because of their one hour check in requirement. But if others were doing web checkin like me -- couldn't they have missed the flight? I'd never heard of a flight leaving early before.\n\nPS: This was the 2nd earliest flight on the board at CNX.",

Usually it's the early flights when there are free landing/departure slots available and everyone booked has boarded. More common for domestic flights (including intra-EU/EEA) than international ones which involve more paperwork and airspace coordination.",

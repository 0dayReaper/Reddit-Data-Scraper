    "postText": "I'm doing my first solo trip--to Poland! I've traveled a bit internationally, but it was 12ish years ago (I'm 32) and I traveled with 2-3 other people; have done a few short solo trips in the US (where I'm from). \n\nCurrent itinerary is below, but I'm toying with the idea of cutting out Wroclaw and splitting those days between Gdansk and Krakow--would like thoughts about this!\n\n**Internet/data** \\- I've seen that you can rent portable wi-fi--is that a better option than getting a SIM card? or would I still need to get a SIM card even if I get the portable wi-fi? I've looked at my phone carrier/plan and it doesn't seem like I have an option to just pay them extra $ for int'l data while in Poland.\n\nWhen traveling I like to just wander around to see what I find, but usually have a few specific things planned and a longer list of \"possibilities.\" I don't care much for art museums (tho prefer modern art), but love street art, cool architecture (incl. brutalist architecture), queer stuff (I'm nonbinary/queer), abandoned buildings/places, markets/festivals, botanical gardens, music, and tasty but affordable food. I'm staying in private rooms in each place; in general am social but not outgoing, and am ok being alone.\n\nCurrent itinerary:\n\n**Gdansk** \\- would like to visit Malbork Castle (1/2 day trip), Museum of Second World War, walking tour; if I add a day to Gdansk, I'd consider going to Gdynia or Sopot--thoughts?  \nDay 1: Fly into Gdansk (land about 12), check in at hostel  \nDay 2: Gdansk (full day)  \nDay 3: Gdansk to Wroclaw (travel day)\n\n**Wroclaw** \\- Ksiaz Castle (1/2 day trip), walking tour; don't have a whole lot planned for Wroclaw  \nDay 4: Wroclaw (full day)  \nDay 5: Wroclaw (full day)  \nDay 6: Wroclaw to Krakow (travel day)\n\n**Krakow** \\-  walking tour, Auschwitz-Birkenau, Wielickza Salt Mine (1/2 day trip); if I add a day--trip to Zakopane/Tatra Mountains? (don't really care about the thermal spas, would be cool to hike a little bit but I don't know how possible that is)  \nDay 7: Krakow  \nDay 8: Krakow  \nDay 9: Krakow   \nDay 10: Krakow to Warsaw (travel day)  \nre: Auschwitz--how difficult is it to get there via public transit? is it better to go with a tour group from Krakow?\n\n**Warsaw** \\- haven't done much research/planning yet  \nDay 11: Warsaw (full day)  \nDay 12: Leave Warsaw - flight at \\~12pm",

Restauracja Gda\u0144ska also great, seems posh (more expensive by Polish standards) but its amazing Polish food and the decor is stunning. \n\nNot everyone\u2019s cup of tea but a little out of the city there is a district with 50+ large murals on the sides of buildings. All different but all cool. Really enjoyed it for a few hours but a 30 minute ride out. Your not in Gda\u0144sk for too long (which is fine, not biggest city), 100% do WW museum. I did 2 days and didn\u2019t get chance to go to Gdynia or Sopot sadly as would have taken most of the day. \n\nKrakow: I did Auschwitz without tour. Book your spot in advance. Getting bus was straightforward, just roll up at station. Buses were regular (hourly?) and takes a few hours. Not a whole lot in area around it but if you wander- buses are busy on way back, best get them right outside entrance rather than walking towards staton. Bus was full by time made it to station and couldn\u2019t pick anyone up.\n\nSalt mines a short train ride- ticket machines ON train. Can\u2019t buy at station machines so be aware.\n\nWill have a think back to Warsaw and get back to you if I can think of anything. I\u2019m UK resident so can\u2019t help on data front I\u2019m afraid! Poland is great, you will love \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1",

Couple items that jump out: \n\n* I\u2019d consider adding a day in Gda\u0144sk. Arrival day is usually tough to plan anything with jet lag. \n* Malbork Castle is huge! I\u2019d plan for the majority of the day. We enjoyed it. \n* Wroc\u0142aw\u2019s city center in the evening is pretty chill and one of my favorite memories \n* We decided to hire a service to drive us to/from Auschwitz. It turned out to be a great decision time wise. Prepare yourself for the emotional gut punch. \n* We did a small pierogi making class in Krakow that was an absolute blast. \n* If you are looking for a slower day in Warsaw, we really enjoyed the gardens at Wilan\u00f3w after touring the Museum.\n* Try the soup called \u017burek. It is the best!",

Be sure to leave your phone in airplane mode.  (My carrier has daily international plans and would activate it if I received any text or call).  I've never used a sim card, but that's often recommended on this sub.\n\nHave you looked at each city's official tourism website?  I'm looking at a trip to Tallinn and the site features a lot of street art on their \"things to see section.\"",

(Krakow, Warsaw, Zakopane, Gdansk, Wroclaw) \n\n1)To get to auschwitz via public transport I would 100% recommend purchasing your tickets to Auschwitz and bus tickets in advance. Bus tickets and the schedule are only available for sale at the Krakow bus station with the exception of the Lajkonik bus. For your return trip to Krakow, I would highly recommend purchasing the bus ticket 1-2 days online before your trip.\n\nPersonal experience: I took the last bus of the day and there was a huge crowd of people swarming the bus, but the bus driver let those with online tickets board first. \n\n2)  I would recommend going Zakopane for the mountains as well but the hikes get touristy during the weekends, so you may want to go on weekdays instead. I recommend staying in zakopane for at least a day if you are going to hike.\n\n- Zakopane transportation runs mostly on public buses (3 zlotys per ride) and minibuses. You would need to take a minibus to the location of the hikes. Price varies based on distance (7-15 zlotys one way)\n\n3) Poland has many milk bars (bar mleczny) which sell local food for affordable prices. If I am not wrong, they were originally subsidised during the soviet-era by the local government and continue to be subsidized to this day.\n\nI have a list of food places I tried in poland, if you want it I can send it to you!",

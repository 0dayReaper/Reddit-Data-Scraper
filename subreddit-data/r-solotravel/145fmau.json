    "postText": "Has anyone else found themselves grappling with a certain boredom that seems to haunt the experience of solo travel? Let me clarify, I\u2019m in my early 20s, and I'm well aware that this might color my perception, especially given the general consensus on Reddit that solo travel is all about delving into the local culture,\n\nHowever, as a young guy on the move, I can't help but feel somewhat bored in places that don't have a lively backpacker or party scene. For example some areas in the Mediterranean and the Balkans. While yes, they are regions abundant in breathtaking vistas, rich in culture, and a food paradise, it's just harder to solo travel there than a backpacker hub in SEA or Colombia without feeling isolated and bored.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I appreciate the enriching aspects of solo travel, but it can get a bit lonesome. It\u2019s the feeling of being in a crowd yet feeling utterly alone that gets me. Sure, interacting with locals does ease this solitude to some extent, but it's fundamentally different from bonding with fellow travellers. These interactions tend to be bound by surface level politeness.\n\nOn the contrary, meeting young travellers in a hostel instantly provides a sense of instant bonding. The prospect of going out to party or embarking on some spontaneous venture together is undeniably thrilling, and it is this aspect of travel that I sorely miss in regions without a backpacker scene.\n\nWhile it's nice to dream about a solo adventure in some hidden gem village in Southern France maybe I'm not at a stage to appreciate or enjoy those kinds of vibes yet. \ud83e\udd14",

Believe me when I say you will get to a point where you will never want to party again but that is still probably years away. Have fun, party it up, make some good memories and when that stage of your life is done you can enjoy other things about traveling and have some fond memories too.",

            "comment": "My personal experience is that when exploring places without a 'backpacker party scene', the number of fellow travellers around me decreases, but the quality of the conversations increases substantially. Fellow travellers will still usually be found at accommodations. \n\nIn SEA, the conversation Is usually gonna be: 'where you going' 'where did you go before this' 'where you from' 'cheers man!' 'dude I'm so drunk!1!1!'\n\nIn less touristy places Ive been to, such as Vanuatu or Jordan, the conversation tended to be much better. We talk about what exactly drew us to this type of destination, and often our travels before and the unique and strange places we've been before. Often the conversation will evolve and its hard to guess where it will lead, but it usually finds a way. \n\nI look a good party once in a while, but I prefer good conversations with like-minded travellers.",

I learned that you have PLENTY of time to party while traveling. I was 45 when I last partied in Belize. If you find yourself without a party just take it for what it is. You\u2019ll find others up for partying on your next town.",

I've found the thing that works for me is getting a job at a good hostel for a little bit before hitting those more isolated regions. Feels silly to say but it's like getting a full charge on my social battery.",

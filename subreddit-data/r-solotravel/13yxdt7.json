    "postText": "For the longest time I\u2019ve been wanting to travel Latin America for an extended period of time. A year at least. Perhaps two. \n\nI\u2019m a 30 year old American that owns a house and works a 9-5 job. No kids, no girlfriend, just a cat.\n\nMy idea is that would put all of my things in storage, rent my home with the help of a property manager. I thought about selling but the idea of having a place to come back to sounds like the smarter option. Plus I can make an additional $400 on top of my mortgage payment which can help facilitate the trip.\n\nAnother source of income that I receive is roughly $1800.00 in disability from the government from being injured during my time in the military. All said and done, I\u2019ll bring in roughly $2200 per month without having to work. Now the actual amount I\u2019ll have available to travel will probably be less if I minus the cost of a storage unit, fees associated with having a property manager and other small expenses like my phone bill. Let\u2019s call it $1800 per month.\n\nWill this be enough to travel? I plan on traveling slow. Maybe 30-60 days in each country. I\u2019ll stay at a mix of hostels and cheaper hotels and most likely cook my own food or opt in for street food.",

Good luck:)",

However, I would definitely recommend having some back up / savings.\n\nAlso I didn't pay attention to my budget to much, and drank a good amount of alcohol to, but I did almost exclusively sleep in hostels.",

I am staying in Airbnbs, eating good, and doing all the activities I want.  As well, I am moving a bit faster than you, the slower you move the less money you will spend.  So far, Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil have been the most expensive countries I\u2019ve been to.  Im heading to Peru and Bolivia next which are cheaper so my daily average spend of $60 should theoretically go down.",

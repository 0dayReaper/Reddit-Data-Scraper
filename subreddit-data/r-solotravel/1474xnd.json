    "postText": "I think it\u2019s very easy when solo travelling to judge cities and destinations we visit based on the people we met in a destination, or the hostel we stayed in, or the friends we made in such destination. Of course the people we meet can have a profound impact on our travel experiences and are a crucial part to having a great (or sometimes bad) time.\n\nBut too often I see people recommend particular destinations simply based off of the people in their hostel, or the friends they made on a particular tour etc. The kinda thing where people say \u201cBro you have to go to City A, it\u2019s so easy to meet people and make friends, stay in this hostel\u201d\u2026 whilst totally ignoring the destination itself, the attractions, the food, the atmosphere, the history, etc.\n\nSo my question is trying to strip off the \u201crose-tinted glasses\u201d and ask, objectively speaking - \u201cname your top 5 favourite cities you visited as a solo traveller, ignoring the influence of the people you met?\u201d\n\nI guess for me, mine would be: Barcelona, New York, London, Berlin and Krakow\n\nHow about you?",

                                    "comment": "For me, there are a few specific reasons. One of the biggest is that it manages to feel somewhat similar to both Eastern and Western European cities in some parts, yet at the same time it feels completely different to any other city in Europe. This is due to the rich history of the city that features Ottoman minarets and mosques, fancy Austro-Hungarian buildings, brutalist Yugoslav commie blocs and buildings that were shot up or destroyed during the Bosnian War. While there is this dark energy that permeates much of the city (besides being brutally besieged for multiple years during the war, it's also where WWI began as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand happened close to the main square), the people are all super friendly and have no issue telling you about their city, both the good and the bad history.\n\nFurthermore, the whole city is surrounded by gorgeous mountains where you can even take a cable car to the top of one mountain and find the abandoned bobsled track from the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics, which is a must-visit attraction as nature and graffiti have taken over much of the track, giving it this cool abandoned vibe to it. You can also do some hiking and other activities here, too.\n\nThe food is awesome if you eat meat and their traditional Bosnian coffee really appealed to me, it's def cheap for Europe (a \nbit cheaper than Serbia overall but not as cheap as North Macedonia or Bulgaria), and it's not a huge city at all, so 2-3 days should be enough to see and do everything in it. \n\n There are more reasons than these, but for me, the biggest reason why I loved it is because it feels like a part of Europe that still has not caught up to the rest of the continent. You will hardly find a card reader there, even getting a SIM card proved more trouble than it should have been (tho I could not get mine at the airport so YMMV), mobile check-in at the airport is pointless since they apparently have no QR code scanners and thus can only scan paper plane tickets. Hell, when I was there, I learned that McDonald's just exited the country since the one franchisee whop ran all McD's in the country had a ton of debt and was corrupt af, so they shut down all locations and just vacated that market. \n\nFurthermore, you will barely see any European/Int'l shops on the main \"shopping\" street, which to me is a huge plus as most of those streets in Western Europe are all pretty much the same and not worth visiting. However, that's not the case with Sarajevo. \n\nImma end it here since I could go on all day about why I love this city, but just know that if you are in Europe or are planning to travel to Europe, keep Sarajevo, Bosnia, and pretty much the Balkans as a whole in mind as you will have a much more unique experience there than in most of western Europe.",

You can get SIM cards on every kiosk and at any carrier shop, quite easily without any documents needed.\n\nThe airport thing is something new they introduced a few months ago due to mainly Turkish people (not pointing fingers but that's the report) abusing the boarding passes and trying to board different airlines. It will be restored back to allowing mobile boarding passes when everything is done regarding the recent airport expansion.\n\nMost of the classic brands are in malls, you will rarely see any of the shops in city centres around B&amp;H.\n\nAnd as for McDonalds, they made great net profits but the owner didn't want to pay rent at one of his locations and used the franchise company account to buy himself cars so the US folks revoked his franchise. He will now relaunch it as a knockoff restaurant and KFC will remain the only chain at the moment until BK opens in late summer.",

As for the SIM card, two carrier shops turned me away saying they don't sell SIM cards and instead they told me to go to a small electronics shop that was selling them. \n\nAnd that makes a lot more sense with the airport, I think this was the only occurrence where I could not use a mobile boarding pass at a European airport. \n\nIMO keeping those shops in malls and not near the city centre is a small difference that makes Sarajevo stand out so well, like it makes the place feel more organic and def less corporate. So tired of seeing H&amp;M and other major chains taking up historic city space. \n\nAnd thanks for the clarification on the McD's fiasco! I knew I mixed up some details about that.\n\nOne thing I forgot to mention is that Bosnia is the only country in Europe that has Caribou Coffee, which is the Starbucks competitor from my home that is way better than Starbucks in virtually every way aside from maybe sandwiches. Having lived in Europe at the time, it was so nice to see my favorite coffee chain while traveling (even if it was not as good as the Caribou back home)",

The holocaust museum hits hard and teaches me something new each time I go.  And then there is all the many other Smithsonian or other museums in the area.  \n\nSo it all depends on what you enjoy.",

I found the people to be polite, the food to be incredibly fresh, the architecture, art and culture to astound me every time I visit. \n\nRunner up urban city: Amsterdam. It might rank higher but I cannot stand the scent of weed. But the canals and the architecture, combined with the history is up there. \n\n2nd runner up urban city: Kyoto, Japan. I would not want to live there due to the misogyny I saw, but there is no doubt the hidden gardens are breathtaking, and the food is top notch. \n\nTop medieval city: Bruges, Belgium. It\u2019s tiny and overpriced, but it is stunningly beautiful. \n\nTop peaceful city near nature: Reykjavik, Iceland. I\u2019m not actually a fan of Nordic architecture, but the city is adorable, clean, and right next to an other worldly natural wonderland. Oh, and gnomes! \n\nI want to add the top cities I never want to return to as an interesting contrast: \n\n1. Cairo. I have never been harassed to the extent I was in Cairo and other parts of Egypt. It\u2019s unfortunate as the history is so incredible. \n\n2. Moscow. I had never been to a city where the people looked so depressed. (This was in the 2000s).",

The freezing cold air from the wild Atlantic ocean was something that I appreciated. Besides that, its also a place I've seen more Gaelic signages and the language itself being spoken by Irish people in comparison to other parts of the country which I visited. And In nutshell I could feel Galway is more Irish than the rest of the cities and counties I went in all of Ireland.",

I usually love most cities and towns I visit for their attractions alone because I hardly ever stay in hostels and don't meet other travellers too much (at most on a tour or a casual conversation at the bar - but never a follow-up). \n\nAmong smaller towns, I prefer places with a beautiful setting, rich architectural heritage, and great food. Luang Prabang, Udaipur, Galle, Franschhoek, and Ljubljana were my favourites in that regard. Khiva is a bonus entry, though the food wasn't exactly to my liking there.\n\nWhen it comes to bigger cities, its usually a mix of history, ease of getting around, and the general vibe of the place that does the trick for me. I loved Bangkok, Singapore, Kathmandu, Cape Town, and Barcelona. I thought Prague was very pretty, but was somewhat turned off by the sheer number of hen- and stag-parties running amok there. I didn't have enough time in Budapest but think it has potential to replace Barcelona. \n\nI also absolutely love London, Paris, Mumbai, and Kolkata - but those aren't cities that I've 'visited' as much as cities I lived for work or study at various points. Same goes for Delhi, my hometown. :)",

The place feels the most accepting of solo people in general. \n\nMelbourne: I haven't been since 2019 so I don't know if it holds up.\n\nOsaka: see Tokyo but with less options.\n\nFrankfurt: pleasant surprise, compact but with a lot of options. Felt very solo friendly. I don't know if it would hold up for more than a few days though.\n\nSeattle/PNW: Good food great outdoors, a decent music scene and people mostly leave you alone. YMMV but I think it's a pretty great place to solo travel for a week or two.\n\n\nBut I'm not the most well travelled person.",

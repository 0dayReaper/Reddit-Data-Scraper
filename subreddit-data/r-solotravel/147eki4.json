You can get \"shower\" body wipes or I prefer the sponges that just need a little water to lather &amp; dry shampoo. Planet fitness or truck stop for real shower. I keep a 5 gallon water container and small cooler in the car. Portable urinal and a small DC inverter to charge my electronics, make coffee.

University of North Dakota had a great engineering program, looked great on paper, full ride scholarship, then I went in person...  I ended up going to AZ State and it was the best decision of my life.  \n\nPlus, the neighborhood a school is in really matters, especially on the East Coast.  Boston and NYC schools have super high cost of living, but a 15 minute ride on the commuter rail could make it way more affordable and preclude owning a car.  Also, some schools are in outright dangerous neighborhoods.  Maybe it's not worth spending the whole time you're in college looking over your shoulder and trying to deescalate hustlers.  Maybe that small liberal arts school doesn't have any cheap off-campus housing, or the small town has a bad drug/crime problem.  None of this will be really obvious from the pamphlets.",

I worked at a college and the pandemic really limited the ability to run things things like tours and open houses. Pretty much every department (different programs, financial aid, residence) created videos and virtual tours that gave a lot of information, sometimes even more than before. For example, the in person tours for residence were one suite in one building (out of four) and didn\u2019t include any common areas. The videos went through all the common areas, and the various buildings. I went back to school last year and when looking into the program, I found the recorded open house presentation more informative than the one I attended in person. \n\nOP should consider narrowing down their choices using virtual resources and then picking the top two or three to visit in person.",

These are good because they have so many people coming in and out, they wont notice you parked in the back. I would park behind the building and sleep there for 4-6 hours. Nobody came up to my car, never bothered. But sleeping in cars is not comfortable, I've had the privilege of sleeping in large luxury cars like BMW X5 and Audi A8, even those roomy leather seats i woke up achey and didnt sleep well. \n\nRest stops you would think are an obvious place, but i never felt safe sleeping at rest stops. One big problem was road noise from passing cars. Also I feel like sketchy people, thieves etc. Scope those places out more than behind a gas station where they see your car and assume its the clerks. \n\nAvoid neighborhoods, might be obvious, but police will show up. Unfortunately this is going to apply in most metro areas (except behind gas stations!!!).\n\nIn addition, gas stations have convenient mini marts for you to grab coffee and snacks when you wake up.",

I have a crossover type vehicle, and I have the seats down in the back so that I can just crawl back there. I have a small camping pad and sleeping bag set up. I will also duct tape fabric to the windows because I'm freaked out by people looking in. I also got some mesh to cover my sunroof in, so that I can crack it while I sleep without fear of bugs. \n\nIt's nice because I will usually just keep driving until I start getting tired, and then route to the nearest rest stop, pull over, not even get out of my car, sleep, and then wake up in a cool new place. I also use this method because I'm a solo female traveler, and I'm more comfortable if less people are aware I'm there. If there are no relatively close rest areas, Walmart parking lots have also been great, most of them have a policy which allow for overnight parking/sleeping to accommodate for RVs. \n\nBUT this is all WEST of Illinois. The farthest east I've gone has been Ohio, and it didn't seem as \"rest stop - sleeping\" friendly. Might need to do some research on your route and if rest stops are available. Walmarts might be your best bet out that direction! But I'd also look into KOAs or other maybe cheaper camp sites at state parks. \n\nGood luck and happy traveling!",

            "comment": "I know this definitely is not what you want to hear but if you cannot afford to visit the schools across the country you should consider not going to those schools. And I really say this with the best intentions - I also wanted to so badly to go across country for college (east to west) but deciding against is one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made for myself. Just gonna explain a bit why\u2026 \n\nWhile looking for colleges I had the money to visit 1 school across country but ultimately understood that if I did go to school there I would be spending more on my education (aka would just be further in debt). I ultimately decided that even tho I loved the school it wouldn\u2019t be worth the extra money during this time in my life.\n\nAnd god was I right. College is fun and all but it is also a fuck ton of work when you don\u2019t have someone else supporting you financially like I didn\u2019t. Your juggling finically supporting yourself, trying to make new friends, and studying for your degree. It\u2019s a lot. Never to this day have I ever had to juggle as much as I did in college.\n\nAt first I was so disappointed I didn\u2019t get to go to college across country. But today I realize that was probably the best decision I\u2019ve ever made for myself because it allowed me soo much freedom after graduating. I saved TONS of money on my education and payed off the small amount of accumulated debit the summer after graduating. Just months after graduating I moved across the country with absolutely no debit, no classes to worry about and was able to find a job to support myself in my field. \n\nInstead of going to college across country like I dreamed, I waited, and from my view point today it was the best choice I ever made. And I seriously never thought I\u2019d say that.\n\nI know this is not exactly answering the question asked but I was reminded so much of my own life years ago so I figured I would just throw out some advice that really ended up working for me. I totally recognize I have absolutely no idea of your situation and regardless of what you do I wish you best of luck on your own journey\ud83d\udc4d \n\nAs far as visiting colleges out there start by applying, and plan on visiting your favorite places you got into. Don\u2019t bother visiting an insane amount of colleges if you want do start visiting sooner, there is a certain amount of research you can do online in order to narrow down the number of schools you would visit. Only plan on visiting your top choices after research. \n\nEast coast (grew up there) is not quite as sleep in car friendly as the west coast, though it is very much possible. Look at state laws for sleeping overnight at rest stops (each state has very different regulations). Look for Walmarts that offer free overnight parking. Depending where you are you might be able to find cheap state camp grounds (usually like $10 a night). It is very hard to give much more advice than that without actually knowing where you will be on the east coast, there are a lot of states on the east coast which are VERY different from each other. Be aware there are places on the east coast you definitely shouldn\u2019t be spending the night in your car because it would be very unsafe, so you should plan to have some money for hotels. \n\nAlso if your gonna sleep in your car, consider getting window screens, the further south you go the worse the bugs will get. If you are traveling alone in your car, don\u2019t tell people you are traveling alone ever (easy target).",

    "postText": "One of the times I was staying at a guest house run by a Brahmin family.  I was about 30 seconds away from the house when it became apparent that I was going to shit liquid and there was no stopping it.  \n\nI shat my pants as I reached the doorstep.  My entire right leg was completely brown, and when the host answered the door I had to explain what happened while shit slowly dripped onto his doorstep.  Furthermore, I was drunk, which made it look as though I got so drunk I shat myself, which was not the case.  As I walked upstairs to my room I left deposits of my shit throughout his hallway and on the stairs.  \n\nI then shat myself again in the morning, however I had pulled my pants down trying to make it the the toilet, so I basically just took a giant shit on the floor and my pants.  The guy was not happy and his family was unwelcoming after the incident.  He told me this had never happened at his house before.  I believe him.\n\nFor me, every shit in India has been an emergency.",

Let me tell you one thing that for some reason wasn't painfully obvious to you: If you have wet shit in a closed space (house), the smell gets worse, not better, the longer you let it fester and it stuff around it soaks the smells.\n\nHe also said he shat on the floor and his pants the next morning instead of the damned toilet and the host was very upset, which indicates that the host had been relegated to cleaning up after the hungover visitor.\n\nHe didn't necessarily 'forced'/'commanded' the owner to clean after him, but if you're a home owner and someone is still all over the place, it's your house that is going to smell like shit after this dude leaves, so you're going to be on top of things.",

You can't eat that for dinner for 2-3 consecutive days.\n\nSouth Indians eat more milder dishes with mostly rice as the main ingredient. Flavours are also milder. You also get a variety of grains in the south e.g. Maharashtra has Jowar, Bajra, Ragi etc Rotis. Proper south india has different fermented rice based dishes.",

Well, farting &amp; following through, not getting drunk and shitting like a monkey all over my hosts house. I\u2019m pretty sure a large amount of gut problems come not from the food but from not washing or at least sanitising hands before eating. \n\nIt\u2019s so easy to forget but after a day in say Delhi, shopping in Paharganj and maybe petting that cute street pup in Old Delhi you can easily munch a samosa or transfer from your hand to the rim of your chai cup. That\u2019ll see you with a good belt of giardia which\u2019ll floor you. Did me. Plus a shitload of alcohol in India is \u2019first copy\u2019 or basically counterfeit. Fuck knows what\u2019s in it. (Ditto cigarettes &amp; rolling tobacco) \n\nAlso fuck Imodium, it\u2019s nonsense. All it does is plug the bottle leaving the soup inside to keep reproducing. If you haven\u2019t already I\u2019d urge you to go to any chemist and get a three day course of ciprofloxacin. It\u2019s widely available in India, big orange tablet. Or azithromycin. Or just point at your stomach and say \u201cDelhi Belly\u201d. These things have a habit of hanging around long after the symptoms have gone and a bacterial or amoebic infection can return to haunt you, trust me. Also some half decent opium, also widely available, whilst the antibiotic is doing its thing will tighten your gut like Imodium never will. Next day you\u2019ll have a big, satisfying, solid chode. The psychological lift of that alone after days of the galloping trots is v therapeutic. I\u2019d stay away from tap water if you\u2019ve not and avoid street food for a bit.",

Been eating spicy food all my life growing up.\n\nHowever, i am not Indian or of local race. In my community, there's always this racist idea that if you were to eat Indian or any local food, you are going to upset your stomach because they were not clean.\n\nThis is absolutely bull shit.\n\nI served in the army for my national service. I was posted to this unit where i got to know the kitchen crew pretty well and they are mostly either Muslims or Indians. And i ate like a king when i was hanging with them. Almost every evening, they will bring back some \"special\" dish that they prepared in the unit kitchen (something that's not on the official menu) and we will have a party. I just bring the beer.\n\nI love my spice and these guys only cook with spice. Yes the first couple of weeks, i had a cleansing moment with my bowels. However, after that, i never had problems.\n\nFast forward 30 years. I lived in Europe and can only get hold of spicy food occasionally. Whenever i have spicy food again, my bowels would go through those cleansing moment. Even when i go back to Asia to visit families.\n\nIt always take a few days to one week for my system to get used to it. So i can only understand how hard it must be for foreigners.\n\nSo, even if you are eating at extremely clean restaurants, you will get stomach issues if you were eating the local spice. It will upset your system. \n\nHowever, if you are eating at street food hawkers where hygiene is an issue, you only have yourself to blame.",

After a round of antibiotics though, give it a couple days for your gut to settle--don't nuke your gut with constant anti-biotics, that's just as bad.  Do take Imodium to slow the passing but you do want to continue to pass this and be rid of it--so don't take too much.\n\nIf it's really bad, go to hospital, they'll hook you up with IV fluids and test your stool to identify the bacteria and then give you anti-biotics for that bacteria.  \n\nI was on Cirpofloxacin 500 mg, 1/day for 3 days after testing positive for Campylobacter JeJuni.  It helped a lot.\n\nGeneral advice for rural India is to just eat vegetarian and bottled water always, always.  If no bottled water, then both filter and add purifying tablets.\n\nWet wipes.",

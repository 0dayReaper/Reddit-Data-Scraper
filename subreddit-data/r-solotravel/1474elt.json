I was able to find a really good hotel (after research) in the 9th arrondissement. Please let me know if this is a good area because if not, I can change to another area. I'm a POC woman if that helps. \n\n**Day 1** \\- Arrival in Paris and check into the hotel. \n\n**From Day  1-Day 6** \\- explore all tourist attractions. Check out restaurants and whatnot.\n\n**Day 6** \\- Check out of the hotel in the morning. Take flight or train to Barcelona. **Which one do you advise?**\n\n**Day 6-Day 10** \\- Check into the hotel in Barcelona. Explore all tourist attractions and whatnot. \n\n**Day 10** \\- Check out of Barcelona and head back to Paris because that's where I will be taking flight home. If I book flight home out of Spain, it is prohibitively expensive. \n\n**Day 11** \\- arrive back in Paris and relax. Check into a hotel. \n\n**Day 12** \\- Fly out of Paris. \n\nWhat do you think? Would 5 days be enough in Barcelona?",

            "comment": "Yes, the 9th Arr. is generally a good area, but can be a little sketchy in areas at night. Use google maps, street view for your hotel and look around the street your hotel is on. \n\nIt\u2019s a 6:30 train ride from one to the other. Are you interested in seeing the sights from the train along the way? Or getting there faster?\n\n5 days in Barcelona is good to see some of the highlights, but you may want to consider booking skip the line tours for some of the more popular tourist attractions like Sagrada Familia and G\u00fcell Park.\n\nBarcelona, while beautiful, is known as the world capital of pickpockets. I don\u2019t say that to scare you , just make sure you are being aware, and careful. I actually caught a pickpocket trying to steal from me when I was there. I didn\u2019t lose anything though.",

I recommend the area around Monceau or Villiers metro stations, lots of lovely little streets and is full of Parisians rather than tourists.",

            "comment": "This looks great! Love how you're focusing on just two cities now. You'll have a great time :)\n\nThe 9th is a convenient place to be and generally safe. The streets toward Gare du Nord and Gare de l'Est can be a bit shady but nothing that can't be managed with some common sense and vigilance. Do remember that the closer you move towards Champs Elysees, the more touristy and overpriced things can get.\n\nI prefer the train between Paris and Barcelona. It's a long trip - 6+ hours, but it'll let you see the countryside, and high speed trains are an experience by themselves. More importantly, you will travel from city centre to city centre (do remember to get to the right stations though, both cities have multiple) in sane hours where you can simply use public transport to move around before and after. Also, you get a lot more legspace, can stretch around whenever you like, and can grab some food and drinks in the dining car. \n\nHowever, trains in Europe can get pricey, so you might be forced to look at flights as well. Some things to keep in mind: (i) low cost carriers in Europe typically do not include any check-in baggage in their base fares, (ii) they use airports that are very far away and need ample time (and a small amount of money) to get to and from - all of that adds up, and (iii) if you fly outside normal hours, you may need to spend on an expensive taxi to move around. Do the math and see what you prefer.\n\n5 days is sufficient for Barcelona, IMO. Ofcourse there will be people who will spend weeks here, but I think 5 days is ample time to discover the city at an easy pace as well as throw in a day trip or two.",

            "comment": "I recommend avoiding 9th Arr. I found that area sketchy when I went to Paris.  I was just down the street from the Moulin Rougeon Montmarte.  Also don't know if this is your 1st time to Paris but there are pickpockets here too(especially on Metro).  My best advice is to try to dress like a local to avoid them.  Dress dark clothes earth tones and no bright anything which could target you as an American. Also by all means travel via TGV(train) instead of a jet so you can see the pretty landscapes and towns and villages.  TGV is very inexpensive! Have fun!",

            "comment": "Although I lived in Barcelona for a year - and it's a wonderful city - I'd concentrate on Paris. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th arrondisements are very walkable and great for just schlepping on your own. But don't forget the nearby day or 1/2 day trips, i.e. Versailles, Chartres, Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau, etc. Barcelona is much smaller in walkable areas of interest and I'd say 3 days is enough for Barca.",

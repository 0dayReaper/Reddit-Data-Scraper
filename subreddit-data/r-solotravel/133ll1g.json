    "postText": "I decided to make this a post of its own because Vietnam was probably one of the best, most intense parts of my trip. This was late October to early November. If anyone reads this, I hope you enjoy!\n\n\n#**VIETNAM -12 days**\n\nI wasn't supposed to go to Vietnam. I had heard it would be a hard country to backpack in, and anyway, way too large to realistically include on my trip. While in Lombok, I had however realized flights from Bali to Hanoi were half as cheap as going directly to Chiang Mai. As fate would have it, I got those couple of extra weeks and decided to take the plunge. Off to Vietnam.\n\nAs soon as I got to Hanoi, I was blown away. I was staying in the old quarters, and all those narrow, little alleys and streets connived to make me fall in love. The food helped too, I miss eating Bun Cha and drinking egg coffee every day.\n\nLet's be real, Hanoi is so vibrant and alive but also a big mess. For starters, the sheer number of motorcycles is terrifying. The advice I got from locals to cross the street was, \"just start walking and don't *ever* stop.\" It did work. However, I heard a few backpackers compare Vietnam's traffic to a well-coreographed dance, where all things fit together somehow and accidents are rare. I beg to differ.\n\nI can't talk statistic but the first and only time I got a Grab in Hanoi, we ran a Vietnamese lady over and I almost flew out of the motorcycle. She was fine, I was fine, but the thing that's seared in my memory is the Grab driver yelling at the lady as if she had willingly thrown herself under the wheels just to spite us. I didn't tell my parents this story to save them a heart attack. Good times.\n\nI was in Hanoi for 4 days, but it could have been longer. The city has so much culture and history to offer, and among other things, I took a great cooking class there. The reason I moved on was that again, I was feeling lonely.\n\nEver since I had left the Bright Course Foundation where I was volunteering, a week before, I had been by myself. I'd chatted sometimes with people, but never really connected. On my very first day in Hanoi, I had taken a free walking tour, hoping to meet people, but my conversation with a German girl started and ended there. Sometimes it just doesn't work out, and it's fine, but I need people around and wanted to shake things up.\n\nI took a bus to Cat Ba and it was the best decision I've made. I was staying at Cocoon Inn, easily the best hostel I'd been in by that point, all the rooms so large and the beds like clouds.\n\nMy first morning there, I was in the lobby and met another German girl (seriously, you'll be hard-pressed to find a spot on this planet without Germans). I can't remember exactly our first conversation but I'm sure it was a variation of the usual.\n\n\"Where are you from? Italy?! You know you're the first Italian solo female traveler I've met? Where have you been so far? What are your plans for today?\"\n\nI didn't have many plans but turns out she had enough for both of us and invited me to join her. I love Germans. An hour later, I was on the back of a motorcycle with a hilarious Indian guy driving, and my new German friend and an Australian girl on a second motorcycle. We waited out the sunset on a viewing point, which wasn't the smartest move because then we had to make our way back through the dark forest. Worth it though, it was stunning.\n\nI had mostly got to Cat Ba because I wanted to see the Halong Bay and however tempting a cruise was, my bank account had other ideas. As I mentioned, it ended up being the best decision I made, so let me expand on that.\n\nTwo reasons, really. First, Cat Ba is breathtaking. The National Park has these beautiful, perfectly triangular mountains and amazing cave formations and there's some nice beaches on the island too. From there, I did an affordable one day boat tour of the Halong bay and it felt enough. \n\nThe second reason was that while there I did the most spontaneous thing on my trip yet. As you may have noticed, I like planning things ahead. Most of my flights were booked weeks in advance. For Vietnam, my fear of life-altering accidents made me stay away from the Ha giang Loop (I swear everyone on that tour seemed to have a story about a person getting air lifted to a Thai Hospital in horrible conditions). At the same time, I didn't have suitable clothing to visit Sapa in November and I had met two Swedish girls who had just come from Hoi An and had to wade in one meter deep water just to get some cash from an ATM because of the seasonal floodings. With little over five days left in Vietnam, I figured I'd just take it easy, maybe go to Ninh Binh for a couple of days and then back to Hanoi where I had a flight booked.\n\nBut then, the Australian and German girls showed me that actually, there'd be no rain in Hoi An for the next week or so. They were going. An Argentinian girl I met on the Halong Bay tour was also thinking of going. We both booked a ridiculously cheap flight for the next morning and left together.\n\nHoi An turned out to be sunny and straight out of a fairy tale. All those lanterns and little boats felt like I was in a Ghibli movie. I had B\u00e1nh m\u00ec every day and let me tell you, it was love at first bite. We rented bicycles  and explored the nearby rice fields full of water buffalos and the coastline. Every night we'd go and listen to live music in some little bar by the river. It was great.\n\nAfter four days, I said bye to the people I had spent a week with and it was quite sad. You can become so close in so little time. Sadly, they were going further south while I took a bus and spent my last two nights, barely more than a day, in Hue. Hue has unique, delicious regional dishes and the imposing imperial city, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I stayed in a private room because I needed a break from people.\n\nOn my final day, I made my way back to Hanoi and took that plane to Chiang Mai. I was dying to be in the city for the second week of November. It had been the very first thing on my bucket list when I started day dreaming about this trip back during our first, scary lockdown in Italy. \n\nMaybe, if you know Thailand at all, you'll guess why I was so excited. Maybe, I'll just write it on the next post :)\n\nCheers!",

I was so mad at myself for only doing 2 weeks when I was at the airport could have easily stayed twice as long in every place. I agree I didn\u2019t have big expectations for Hoi An but seeing the night markets and the river all lit up and all the variety of excursions I could do. I just couldn\u2019t fit it all in 3-4 days. I\u2019m still in SE Asia and I keep flirting with the idea of back tracking and doing some other locations I didn\u2019t get a chance to see. Plus more time in Hanoi! Loved it there. Amazing food on every corner.",

Hanoi is one of those places that the longer you stay the better it gets.  I will probably spend six weeks in Hanoi and do some motorcycle riding besides that.  Kon Tum is also a favorite.  The food and scenery are great, but the main draw of Vietnam for me is the friendliness of the people.",

In Lombok I was often on the back of scooters with the students from the foundation but never drove one myself.\n\nAnd in Vietnam the same, there were a couple places were having a scooter is useful, cat ba is one of them for sure but I just went with other people and let them drive",

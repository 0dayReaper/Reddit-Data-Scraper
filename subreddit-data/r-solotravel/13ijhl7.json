I\u2019d like to ask what are the best volcanoes to hike with this in mind:\nIn the first part I\u2019ll be going to Jakarta, Padang and Flores, then back to Jakarta. From here, I have two options: \n1- go straight to Bali for the rest of the trip and visit a volcano from there(which?), or \n2- visit a volcano on the way (Mount Bromo / Mount Ijen?) and then go to Bali.\nI have a medium fitness level for hiking, but no hiking shoes, and the best view/active volcano the better.\nAlso sunrise or other tour recommendations are welcome! \nThank you :)",

            "comment": "Bromo doesn't require much by way of hiking. The standard tours will drive you to the best view point and then take you to the crater, from where you can walk a bit and then climb a staircase to the rim of the actual volcanic cone - no hiking shoes needed, but you will want to dust your shoes off thoroughly afterwards. It's more of a sunrise tour of sorts than an actual hike, unless you really want to spend time there and visit the quieter spots in the surrounds like Madakaripura Waterfalls and the rest of the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park. That said, Bromo is stunning - it's a view to remember, atleast in my opinion. \n\nIjen is a proper multi-day hike which needs a reasonable level of fitness and basic hiking gear. You should be able to rent out most of the things through an agent. As for hiking shoes, just buy a pair from the local Decathlon, they're cheap and sufficient. \n\nA third consideration - Mount Rinjani on Lombok. It's not as long as a hike as Ijen, but it's also not a simple tour-and-walk experience like Bromo. The view at the top is stunning as well, I'd rank it as a close competitor to Bromo.\n\nBali\u2019s most easily arranged volcano climb is up to the summit of Batur in time for sunrise. It honestly doesn\u2019t compare with what you\u2019ll get on Java (or Lombok).",

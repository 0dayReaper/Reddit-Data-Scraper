    "postText": "After six years of doing it, it\u2019s always the same. The feeling is a lot more muted now but it\u2019s still there, it\u2019s quite common I imagine? Also no matter how many times I tell myself on the way to my next hostel \u201cI\u2019m gonna strike up convo and make friends\u201d I get there and revert to my quiet, reserved self. Wherever you go, there you are. Then again more often now I overhear the conversations of other solo travelers and have absolutely no interest in engaging - especially here in SE Asia. People talking about their route, acting like an expert on the country they\u2019ve just come from, having an ego contest where they humble brag and don\u2019t actually listen to eachother etc. it\u2019s the new generation of backpackers who have been inspired by TikTok that have put me off the lifestyle for now. I think I\u2019ll go \u2018home\u2019 soon to figure out what direction I want my life to go in next. I hope this post doesn\u2019t offend anyone, I\u2019m happy that people are following their calling to travel. It\u2019s not easy, especially alone but it\u2019s not the general crowd I want to be part of.\n\nEdit: looks like there will always be people who find a reason to be offended \ud83d\ude44 I am aware what environments I feel most comfortable in and where I want to avoid, I am not being judgmental. My post is not there to discourage anyone from doing what they want to do!",

It was a rowdy, crazy, enjoyable time and one of the things that was most awesome was when 3 others told me they\u2019d just come from Prague and that I had to go. \n\nI returned home, saved up money and the next trip I took was straight to Prague! \n\nThanks to those super cool people I met.\n\nBut this was before TikTok or IG, so people\u2019s stories (IRL) mattered way more than stupid ass IG \u201cstories\u201d to me.",

Most hostels or popular travel routes are full of people desperate to tell each-other that they\u2019re the most adventurous, unique person in the room and it\u2019s quite difficult not to get swept up in it. \n\nI\u2019ll never forget talking to a group of American guys on a popular backpacker route. I had just moved away from a city in Asia that I had been living in for four years, and one of them immediately started to mansplain about how much he hated it and how superficial it was\u2026 he had visited there for a week, a decade ago \ud83d\ude02\n\nI\u2019d say the best thing to do is stay humble, do your own thing and don\u2019t try and dick swing. You\u2019ll find pockets of chill people who are more your speed, and if not, then you can always move on. I\u2019ll always vouch for Airbnb experiences, I\u2019ve met some great people there that don\u2019t tend to stay in hostels",

At other times I was with a group of friends so it was ok. And I was under 30 then.\n\nI am a 39f, Swiss traveller, adopted from India (POC).\n\nWith my parents I always stayed at upscale 4 Star Hotels. With friends I did hostels as a teenager, (with school) and in my 20s, Hotels/privat Hostel rooms during LTRs  2004-2018 and few AirBnBs (always entire places) 2012-2019.  Since 2022 I'm doing nice hotels, mostly ob my own.\n\nSolo travel I did 1 hostel, quite a few air bnbs and uniquely hotels since last year.\n\nI think it's linked to my age and changing needs of comfort. My budget is also better than in the hostel days (about the same for air BnB and hotels, although 130\u20ac buys you a lot less comfort in Switzerland than in Germany).\n\nI like a good breakfast buffet (it saves me lunch), I do cake and coffee in the afternoon and a sandwich/sushi in the hotel in the evening or a light meal out. I love that. \n\nI don't feel the need or pressure to make friends. I have nice exchanges with staff or sometimes when out and about with random people, often the elderly are very nice to talk to and love to talk. \n\nSince then I feel a lot better. There's no pressure to be social and it helped me realise that I don't necessarily need people. I have friends at home, I have a book, writing or people watching to occupy myself with. \n\nBut I have met people a handful of time while travelling and we are still Facebook friends and I could go meet them if I came through their city...",

It\u2019s really easy just to walk up to a table of people and join in on the conversation. I\u2019m always curious about other travelers and I genuinely enjoy hearing about the places they\u2019ve visited - that\u2019s how I get great first-hand advice, tips and recommendations about places I want to see/experience. Also, as a solo female traveler, I\u2019m always interested to hear how other solo female travelers adapt to life on the road \n\nMaybe consider the energy you\u2019re putting out. It doesn\u2019t help if you\u2019ve pre-judged and dismissed people before actually taking the time to get to know them.

How he\u2019s an expert traveller, and has been all over the world. I hardly spoke a word but listening to him speak how much of an expert traveller he is, budding into others conversations with each \u201cI\u2019ve been there\u201d followed up with \u201c you have to take this route\u201d in a manner of forcing his travel experience as the right way, as if there is one.  \n\nListening to him say some of the most racist remarks I\u2019ve heard about the local populace in areas he\u2019d travelled. And how he can\u2019t wait to get home to the United States. \n\nThe part you mention about the humble brag really reminds me of him. Except not so humble. I\u2019m by no means a seasoned traveller relative to many I\u2019ve met, just someone who answered the call to quit their job and book a one way. But it\u2019s always interesting being around those types of people, and the party travellers who\u2019s main focus of travel is what bar/club they\u2019re hitting that evening. Those two types I find interesting to observe.",

I think it is just a particular form of small talk driven by harmless excitement. It is the easiest topic to grab that would likely resonate with a stranger. The second most common thing is to tell \"you must come visit my home city, and see A,B and C there. It doesn't matter if the conversation partner has the slightest interest of ever going or not. \n\nSomeone else has already mentioned, it is about asking the questions that interest you and pivot there.\nI have to admit I have also met some cases of verbal diarrhea, where you don't actually get a word in and it is just a summary of the travellers own experiences. But usually, the group that sits at the buy one, get one free hostel night is grateful, if someone shifts the topics to other (more substantial) ones. In my experience.",

I have experienced being judgmental of others or forming opinions about their actions or dumb ass conversations. In the end it didn\u2019t contribute to my happiness, on the contrary I find myself feeling like an asshole afterwards. The times I have expressed myself I found that i\u2019m wrong. Im in my 40\u2019s and am still learning how to be a better person, cause sometimes im a straight up bitch. Im a pretty social person, so I don\u2019t have a hard time meeting people when I want to meet them. I like talking to staff, i like saying hi to people or at-least acknowledge them in some way as we pass each other. \n Behaving in the way you descrive feels kind of bitter. I understand it because Ive experienced that myself. We make decisions about people we don\u2019t know and the things we don\u2019t like about them before we even give them a shot. We decide their not worth our time.\nIm not trying to offend you or anyone, but hopefully Ive given you something to think about. Maybe instead of changing the environment you can start by changing your perspective. \nI learn way more from the people who disagree with me, if that helps.\nSafe travels!",

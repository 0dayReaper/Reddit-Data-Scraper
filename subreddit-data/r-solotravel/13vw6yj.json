    "postText": "The only set in stone dates are my arrival to and departure from Lima, July 3rd-July 17th.\n\nI'll arrive in Lima at 8 AM on July 3rd. Currently I plan on hopping straight onto a bus and spending 3 days making my way to Cusco with a few one or two-night stops. Then I'll spend another 3 days hanging out in Cusco and adjusting to the altitude. This puts me at the 10th to visit Machu Picchu\u2013I'll either do the one-night shortened trek or the train trip.\n\nThis brings me to the 11th with roughly 6 days left in my trip. Is it realistic/a good idea to squeeze in both Mancora and Lima for this amount of time? I would catch a flight from Cusco back to Lima and then straight up to Mancora, probably spend 3 days there, and then either fly or take a bus back down to Lima for the last few days of my trip. I would really love to get some warm weather and a couple of beach days in if it's possible. Otherwise, I'll probably spend a little extra time in and around Cusco and then have a longer stay in Lima at the end of my two weeks. \n\nThanks in advance everyone!",

Heard there's some small airline that flies into Mancora's airport certain times in the year, but cannot be booked on google/ skyscanner\u2013 not sure the name of the carrier, but you need to book on their website.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOtherwise, you're flying into Talara  (closest town), Piura, or Tumbes, and taking the EPPO bus to town through the desert. Mancora is pretty dope, but ngl there are better surf towns out there in Latin America.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMight recommend spending one day in Lima, then visiting Paracas and Huacachina for some adventures.",

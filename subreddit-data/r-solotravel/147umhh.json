    "postText": "I will be going to Mexico for a conference next week. I am an Indian and I have gotten a short stay business Mexican visa. I will be flying to Mexico city. At the entry point, I am required to provide a FMM form. The Mexican embassy website suggests to fill in the form online. But apparently it doesn't seem to work. Has anyone requiring a visa recently gone through Mexican immigration.",

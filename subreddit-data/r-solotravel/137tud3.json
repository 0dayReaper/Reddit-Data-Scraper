    "postText": "Hello! I (25F, Australian) am partway through a seven month backpacking adventure. I am currently planning my last leg which will be in British Colombia, Canada for 3-4 weeks. My gut feel from the research I've done is that hiring a car is the best way to go to fully explore the national parks (Whistler, Banff, and Jasper), but I wanted to hear about others' experience and opinions (particularly solo female travellers) with driving, camping and/or wild camping in Canada.\n\nMy ideal trip would involve a mix of hostels and wild camping (sleeping in a car or campervan), but I'm concerned from a safety perspective both of the animals I'm less familiar with (grizzlys etc.) and with the risk of being isolated if there are any less friendly people about. I have some experience camping and campervanning, but not alone so I would be very excited to push my boundaries with something like this.\n\nI would love to hear from anyone who has any insight! As it's the last leg of my trip I'm not too worried about budget, but am interested in figuring out the best way to have a really unique and personal experience in nature.\n\nThank you in advance!",

            "comment": "As a Canadian women who grew up in the mountains, I personally wouldn\u2019t solo camp in a tent, but I know women who do, but they have had lots of camping experience so it depends on how comfortable you are with that kind of thing. Nights can get *cold* no matter the time of year and it\u2019s often very isolated. If you do decide to camp (or hike solo at all) make sure to buy bear spray. \n\nIf you\u2019re already looking at a car, it might be worthwhile to check out camper vans. You can park in campground or certain lots in Vancouver (Spanish banks) but there are also absolutely hostels in the mountains and cities (Jericho beach in van, HI in the mountains) if you want to go that way. They\u2019re often a bit off the main towns so you\u2019d need a car to get too them. \n\nBut have fun!! It\u2019s an absolutely stunning part of the world. Jasper is super chill and laid back (bears paw bakery is the best) and banff is stunning. Smaller towns have great vibes too (Squamish, golden, etc) and the interior of bc has the Okanagan with beautiful lakes and tons of fruit stands in summer.",

Consider a \u201ccircle tour\u201c using BC Ferries to travel to Nanaimo on Vancouver Island, explore the island (there\u2019s good camping near Parksville), Tofino, Qualicum, etc, down to Victoria, then the Swartz Bay ferry to Saltspring if you want to see a gulf island, then back to the mainland, south of Vancouver, see Vancouver, go up to  Whistler, possibly detour to Langdale and the Sunshine Coast, again by ferry. If you\u2019re coming from Alberta, check out the Okanagan on your way to the coast.  r/vancouver has  a  good wiki on visiting.   \n\nTake the usual precautions travelling alone.  Be sure to be prepared - take water, food, sturdy shoes, layered clothing etc with you when hiking and leave your plans with your hostel or friends. It is easy to get into trouble in the wilderness here.  It\u2019s not so much bears (they will avoid you if you make enough noise and don\u2019t leave food out) but getting lost or staying out too late to hike back and then roughing it in the cold nights.  Have a wonderful time.",

            "comment": "I'm from around here and do a lot of solo hikes.\n\n\nCampgrounds or sleeping nearish others is generally a deterrent for bears. When you camp, make a bear hang. I put all my food, cookware and my toothpaste in my sleeping bag stuff sack and walk 10-15 minutes from camp and hang it up on a tree. It keeps rodents from getting at your food too.\n\n\nDon't eat in or around your tent. If you carry bear spray, it needs to be accessible and ready to use in 2 seconds.\n\n\nAlso, i use the \"recent\" photos on instagram to gauge trail conditions. If you're heading east, May might still have a lot of snow and ice on the trail. Maybe this isn't a big deal to you but it can make it easier to lose the path.\n\n\nCanada doesn't have too many hostels. If you want to play it safe, campgrounds are the way to go. Backcountry camping sometimes needs a permit (often cheap) but you can google \"crown land camping\" for free spots. Camping is always free on crown land. \n\n\nNot sure where you've been but hiking in this part of Canada can seem more wild than Patagonia, the Alps and the Himalayas. A few trails are always well trafficked but you might also go days without seeing anyone too.\n\n\n Hiking a popular route like the Rockwall Trail or the Assiniboine area (BC) might give you the confidence you need to pursue less trafficked hikes. But again, please research your trail conditions because May may not be as summery as you think.\n\n\nI have a lot of Alberta hikes and tips too if you want",

I've literally never heard of anyone stay in a hostel here, I'd be shocked if any even exist outside Vancouver's city centre and maybe Whistler's downtown area.\n\nYou can bus to Whistler, but for Jasper as Banff I would definitely get a car and drive. I know you can charter a bus like RiderExpress, but I've never done that. Public transit is mostly non-existent, or at least incredibly inconvenient and inconsistent, outside the Metro Vancouver area.\n\nLess friendly camping people are most often found in the bush, so - as a girl, but also as a poc - I stick to public campgrounds. I'm sure someone else could tell you about camping on crown land and up logging roads and stuff but that's not my wheelhouse. The public parks usually have rangers that make rounds throughout the week which makes me feel safer, and that's where families are more likely to camp.\n\nYou can book campsites through the provincial website for provincial parks, and through the federal site for national parks. Remember that private campgrounds exist too so check google if you can't get a public campsite. Check if the campgrounds have walk-in sites that don't need a reservation.\n\nThe animals will mostly leave you alone so long as you follow normal camping rules: pack in-pack out, hang or lock up all your food and trash in bear areas, carry bear spray, don't feed or harass or antagonize the wildlife. More comprehensive and specific information on how to behave around the wildlife is often posted around whatever campsite you're at and on the parks' websites.\n\nI can share more if you have more questions. :) I hope this helps.",

I\u2019ve known him for over 12 years and he is very respectful, honest and kind and exploring via campervan is his life. I thinks he\u2019s encountered a lot of wildlife and knows what the risks are and how to handle it.  He can reassure you on any fears or questions you may have and might be able to help you with other inquiries. Have fun!!!",

I am 27 yrs old and eager to explore the world but just as eager to find that special someone to explore it with. Yes this is a \"solo\" subreddit and I am sure there will be many that will say that's not what traveling is about or you shouldn't go in with such an expectation...blah blah blah...but goddammit I want to find that deep love!!\n\nSo I suppose my question to you is.. what experiences did you all have with love while traveling? Did you find mainly lust at party hostels that went nowhere? Did you have  a fling which you thought was going to lead to more as you both traveled together but went your separate ways? Did you find that deep love that was in fact your soulmate along the way? Or did you find none of this but learned to love yourself even more? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would *love* to hear any and all stories/experiences and any advise you could give to a hopeless romantic like me:)",

He was on a year long world travel trip and I was with a friend. It was when the volcanos erupted in Indonesia and caused mass chaos with flights. My friends flight didn\u2019t make it out for weeks and mine did. So my now husband picked me up  at the airport in Bangkok and the rest was history.  \n\nWe call Denmark home now. We\u2019ve been happily married for 7 years and together for 8. We have two boys that are our whole world. Neither of us had any intentions of meeting a person along the way, but as soon as we met we both knew there was something long term there.\n\nMy biggest advice is don\u2019t be afraid to start a conversation with someone. You\u2019ll never know where it could lead.",

Lived in Sweden for a bit but I didn\u2019t like it too much and she had always been wanting to leave. Lived in Germany for a bit and live in the US now and are living happily ever after as they say. One day we will retire in Spain or Italy(at least that\u2019s our plan as of now, it\u2019s a long ways off). \n\nEdit: for OP, neither of us were \u201clooking\u201d for love. We just found it. Strike up conversations. You\u2019ll click with some people, and won\u2019t with others. And just see what happens. You can\u2019t force it or make it happen. And don\u2019t be disappointed if you backpack around the world for years and still haven\u2019t found love yet. It\u2019s definitely tough to not only find someone you like to spend time with, but also spend time together. Rarely do peoples travel plans line up perfectly for weeks / months. I know numerous people that have fallen in love from people they met while traveling. Only 2 out of dozens of travel relationships I know of are still going strong.",

I'd booked on a coach trip out to the Cliffs of Moher and Galway and ended up needing to sit in, to my initial horror, the last free seat on the coach next to a complete stranger.\n\nShe was from Canada, and by the end of the day we had spent most of the day together and were chatting away like old friends in a bar in Dublin. We kept in touch and a connection developed. We started long distance dating and met up twice over the next 6 months in Canada and the US. It didn't work out in the end, but that chance meeting, and the, albeit brief, time we spent together over the year, will always be special to me and will stay in my heart forever.\n\nMy advice - Don't put pressure on anything, and like others have said, don't go looking for love, especially when travelling. Just embrace the opportunities that present themselves. But don't be afraid to build romantic connections while travelling. They may lead to something, they may not, but they are definitely a part of the rich tapestry of life.",

Met a girl at a bar in Dublin this summer, turns out we \u2018only\u2019 lived 8hrs driving apart from each other (which for US is pretty close). We ended up hitting it off really well, and by the end of the night we had a woman come up to us and ask how long we\u2019d been dating. She didn\u2019t believe we\u2019d just met a few hours before\ud83d\ude02danced the night away and then snuck into a park at like 4am for some fun. The next morning, we had breakfast and walked to a park where we just sat and talked for a few hours. But she had plans to head south out of Dublin that day and I had a flight back to the US the day after that, so we had to say goodbye. But those were an unforgettable 12 hours with her.\n\nStory doesn\u2019t end there though! Actually got to reconnect with her this winter- she drove over to my hometown and we spent 4 days together. Although the rose tinted glasses of travel weren\u2019t there, we still had an amazing time catching up. Didn\u2019t feel like we missed a beat, even tho it was 4 months later. Now she\u2019s in Colombia traveling again while I\u2019m stuck at college. \n\nFeel pretty lucky to share that experience with her, and all happened just bc she sat next to me at the bar and started making conversation.",

Sitting around being confident and content just isn't going to work out, unless you're willing to settle for a bottom-of-the-barrel option.",

By focusing on your personal goals, passions and thereby increasing your confidence in yourself and your own sense of fulfillment you've achieved success in relationships that would've otherwise eluded you if you were aimlessly pining for the approval of others. You've become a fuller person that attracts those with similar values. We call it \"work\" bc it is hard to step out of our comfort zones, much less build all of our goals within a life that is already inundated with jobs, obligations, etc but it is really just living your fullest life that becomes the \"sitting in patience\" as Rumi says (or positive actions reaping positive rewards as the law of attraction dictates) versus the deliberate fantasy chase for an imaginary soulmate that the OP is planning to fill with travel",

Such habits without regulation are usually indicative of other negative shit that will lessen your choices for the things that you want. Things like self care, self love and how people perceive you (and whether they will be attracted to you or not) are all ultimately systemic. I.E. a lot of people exercise to get hot but the ones who actually stick to it and succeed are the ones who found a way to actually enjoy it and look forward to it.",

My love of Kerouac gave him the impression that we were destined to be together. He showed up at my hotel at 2 am unannounced and other over the top stuff. \n\nBasically his intense need for me to fit his script prompted impulsive behavior. Be careful of getting swept up, op!",

Like, stay open to the idea, even pursue attraction that might be there to see where it goes. But don't make it your goal because setting that goal might make you act in a way that isn't in your best interest just to achieve that goal. \n\nAnd to use OPs puzzle example, dating apps already knows that piece has a higher likelihood of fitting, since you're both single and matching shows interest in each other in a more romantic sense (at least a level past plutonic). So to pursue a relationship there makes sense. While meeting someone traveling is completely different. Like pursuing a relationship with a stranger on Bumble makes much more sense than pursuing a relationship on Instagram.",

I urge you to just follow your gut to what feels right and the people, places, experiences will meet you where you are, some of these experiences happened when I was extremely cautious even and when you meet the right people who make you feel safe the experiences just seem to get heightened. \n\nDon\u2019t lose hope, I haven\u2019t had a long term but mostly it\u2019s because most of those places were really transitory, who knows for you anything is possible.",

            "comment": "\"...eager to find that special someone...\"\n\nFrom my point of view, this might be a problem.  If you are eager to find someone you run the risk of constantly meeting people and hanging out for a week until you realize you aren't compatible, and then quickly meeting someone else for a week, over and over again.\n\nAnd while you are with someone trying to find out if you are compatible, you won't meet anyone else.\n\nI met a woman on a trail in the Indian Himalayas.  The reason I met her is because I was alone.  If I had been with someone else at the time I wouldn't have met her.\n\nAlso, when I met her, I wasn't looking for someone.  If I had been looking for the next person to date, maybe she would have thought I was a player, and she wouldn't have been as attracted to me.\n\nBecause I wasn't looking for someone, she had to pursue me.  She had to work to get my attention.  I was oblivious to her hints.\n\nBecause I wasn't \"eager to find that special someone\" I was available when the special someone came along, and I believe I was more attractive to her because I wasn't pursuing her.\n\nObviously, you can't always think \"I can't get involved with this person because maybe my ideal partner will come by tomorrow, and I'll miss them.\"  If you always think that way, when your ideal partner comes along you won't get involved with them and you will miss them.\n\nBut the other extreme, always trying to be in a relationship, I think also makes it harder to find your ideal partner.\n\nListen, I just stumbled through life, wandering ignorantly the entire time.  I can't claim I know the answers. \n\nBut ignorant wandering as worked out great for me.  On our 10 year anniversary of meeting we went back to the mountain with our kids.  I wonder what we'll do next year for our 20 year anniversary?",

Regardless of the location, I found I needed to be clearer about what I wanted. When I was, finding a girl who lived near me was just as effective at connecting with a girl while overseas.\n\nJust because you are traveling, doesn't mean finding love is easier. Sometimes it's harder since logistics can be against you when you are constantly on the move. \n\nWhat type of partner do you want? If you want to have a partner who's also into traveling, there are groups online and meetup groups of local hikers that you can begin to connect with to find like-minded people.\n\nThe mindset you share in this post seems to be \"I can only find a soulmate once I start traveling\". Consider instead thinking that your soulmate can be in your same neighborhood and STILL have lots of desirable qualities, like be a world traveler.",

None of them were serious at the time because they were just for fun. You kind of just go with the flow and see what happens! But in terms of \"love\" or something more meaningful, i can imagine is much more rare. Let me tell you a story that just happened to me 6 weeks ago..... it brings me gushy butterfly feelings...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend invited me to visit her in another state in 6 weeks ago in April, and I obliged. My ONLY goal when i visited her was to put myself in new and uncomfortable situations so that i can re-discover who i was again. I had ZERO intentions on finding a man to be with or flirt with, or anything of that nature; i simply wanted to go to a bar alone for the first time in my life and feel more confident doing things like that alone. Not even 5 minutes of me sitting at the hotel bar (I was too chicken to go to a real bar), a man my age came up to me and we started talking. We ended up talking and hanging out in the lobby the rest of the night and we exchanged numbers. I met up with him the following morning before I left, and he drove me to the terminal. We hugged and kissed goodbye. We've been talking every single day since, have had many facetime/phone dates. We both live in different states, and he even flew out to see me 3 weeks after we met. then another 2 weeks later, i flew out to see him for the weekend. now,  a total of 6 weeks later, i'm flying out again to see him for another weekend. So far, it's been absolute bliss and he's so amazing and I can't believe this is happening. Although it's still extremely early to tell what the future holds (we're basically just casually dating long distance), it's been such a romantic journey to remember. If you're looking for love while traveling, don't look for it. It will come at literally the most random/unexpected time! It may last and it may be short lived; no one can know. But what i do know is that you being open to new experiences and going with the flow will lead you to incredible opportunities and stories to remember for the rest of your life :)",

I met two of those people in the same week, then went 3 months without any multi-day friendships/crushes. thats just how it goes. \n\nalso, the romantic connection did not last because he neglected to mention a girl at home... but i'm still thankful for him because it reminded me i could connect deeply (in a romantic sense) with someone (and thankful i didn't compromise any of my travels for him).",

Honestly, I think I'm on the autism spectrum and have struggled with social situations all my life, and traveling is 1000% easier to find love for me.\n\nI think in general that relationships have come to me best when I wasn't really \"trying\". I've never succeeded on any dating app or when trying at any bar or generally when I've been looking, period. Every positive dating experience I've had has come from a moment where I was putting myself out for myself. Doing something I wanted to do for me. Maybe pushing my own boundaries. In other words, being both my best self and most candid self.\n\nSome examples of women I've met in recent years, some hookups and a couple of multi-year relationships, and one I'm currently planning to marry:\n\n\\-  Not travel but a new employee who I was trying to help learn our computer system and some problem solving methods I use.\n\n\\- A native of the country I was visiting sat next to me on a domestic flight as both of our vacations were coming to an end and we were on our way home.\n\n\\- A fellow foreign mountaineer, not from my home country, I met while hiking a beautiful mountain abroad.\n\n\\- An amazing young woman who saw me editing some of my photos in the bunkroom we were both in at a hostel.\n\n\\- A woman who was struggling with her suitcase in the sand, just arrived in town and making her way down the beach to her hotel - I offered to help with made up sign language, as we didn't share a language at the time.\n\nSolo travel has been great for me, I think, because it gets me out of my comfort zone. Away from trying to be socially correct (and uncomfortable with myself) and puts my focus on curiosity, self challenge, enjoyment. It just feels like the baggage is shed. I would suggest to avoid trying so hard. Try to not focus on the fantasy in your mind, focus on having fun. If you want to deliberately engage with people, don't go asking for dates. Give acts of kindness, organize fellow travelers to do stuff, whatever is natural to engage people without a dating goal in mind. The wanting and the pressure will not serve you. Being yourself like no one is watching will be what attracts the best connections, at home or traveling.",

We ended getting along super well and chatted for hours. She had just quit her job and was planning to travel the world. I ended up spending the rest of my trip with her and we had an absolute blast. By the end of my trip we had discussed what was going to happen between us (at the start I thought it was just a hoilday fling, i even made jokes about being hoilday bf and gf) she ended up getting COVID and giving it to me and we isolated together in my home. After we recovered from COVID I showed her around my home town for a week or so. She had decided she wanted to come and work and live with me (which she could easily do because she worked in the medical field so Jobs were easy to get) we lived together and traveled my country for 6 months.

We ended breaking up a month ago and she is finally travel the world with her mum and friends while I'm 2 months in solo in SEA (we were meant to go to SEA together) \n\nI dont regret anything and I miss my travel partner alot. But we both changed and sacrificed alot to make the relationship work and traveling together alot at the start of our relationship where everything was super exciting and new we irgroned alot redflags and incompatibles that we would not of if we meet in everyday life.",

If you socialize in hostels or do workaways or anything like that, you\u2019ll meet wonderful people.

Plus we both have so many issues from past toxic relationships although we connected so well.. we're both equally unlikely to ever be able to hold a relationship with anyone\n\nBut we remain great friends, hopefully forever.

And it's absolutely not her fault that this happened to her, but sadly, she was taking a chance on love - something any one of us might do - and a rapist knew how to take advantage of that",

There was no initial strong lustful attraction, but as I started talking to him more and more, I became attached. He just made me so happy and I felt so lucky to meet him. Eventually, I left the hostel a day early because I started getting in my head. I just got out of a relationship and feel like I have a lot to work on before I get back into the dating scene. Plus, he had a heart condition and I didn't want to risk anything bad from happening because of my baggage. He was expecting to see me that night, but I left earlier in the day. We never exchanged info, so no way of getting in contact. I'm not even sure if he felt the same way. I cried all the way back home and the next day. I will miss him.",

            "comment": "In the past, I never had flings or anything like that dating abroad. My solo trips were purely me exploring the country. I rarely put myself out there too. I was there to see the architecture, the nature, and learn about the history and culture. I usually stay in airbnbs and dont surround myself with other travelers the way you can with hostels.\n\nHowever, last year, I spent one month abroad and had so much fun I extended my trip another month. I was working remotely, so it was fairly easy to just stay longer. I didn't go to the country with the intention to find someone. I had in the past fantasized about meeting my soulmate in another country, but not on this trip. That was what I would daydream about. Meeting some girl abroad and traveling the world with her.\n\nAfter establishing a friend group, I started using extra free time to go on dates with girls via dating apps. Nothing productive came from going on those dates, except they were the ones I was focusing my attention on for dating. I ended up meeting my current girlfriend from that previous mentioned friend group - not the dating apps. I didn't even seek her out or even view her as someone I wanted to date. She was just another cute girl I met while hanging out with my friend group. I exchanged my IG with hers the same way I did with most people I met.\n\nI went back to my home country shortly after meeting her. She was commenting on all my stories and I matched that activity with her. She was super flirty with me and eventually indirectly asked me out for the next time I come back. Well, I went back after a month and stayed another month. We hit it off and spent each of my weekends together. When I went back home again, she came and visited me in my country. She came and looked for places with me when I was looking at moving. I moved closer to her country, but not just for her (although she was a big reason). We're long distance, but just a short plane or few hours drive away. Currently seeing each other physically every couple weeks. \n\nWe're coming up on a year now. This is my first relationship where I've never had a fight or argument with my partner.  Neither of us feel the need to be right all the time. Maybe the long distance thing helps? She is content with doing pretty much anything I want to do, so planning activities is easy. She is incredibly selfless. We like a lot of the same wholesome things even though we're pretty opposite in most areas. We match each other with affection easily. I enjoy doing things to make her happy and her vice-versa. We understand each other. I don't even know how sometimes I just know what she is thinking or she knows what I'm thinking. We come from opposite sides of the world and grew up with different cultures and family values. It just works.\n\nMy friends and family would joke about me falling in love abroad and I just always took it as a joke too, but here we are \ud83e\udd37",

Out of these 4 \u201clove stories\u201d only one ended up on a good note (saying goodbye but being filled with positive emotions and genuine sadness that he have to part ways). Other 3 guys all did the same thing: after a month of traveling hooked up with a different girl, all 3 of them right in front of me. \n\nSo yeah. Good luck with your little fantasy though.",

Long distance was crazy hard. It made me so unhappy and affected my sleep, my performance at work, my motivation. I would never wish that experience on anyone. So I wouldn\u2019t recommend looking for a partner who is not from your city. But I guess other people do long distance and survive.

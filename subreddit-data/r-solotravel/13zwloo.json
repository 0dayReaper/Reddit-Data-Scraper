Bring warm clothes, 2-3 flashlights per person, etc. I visited the park back in October, but I stopped at the mouth of the cave because I started to get nervous. There were no other people at the park, so that persuaded me not to go in. I know it\u2019s not a treacherous cave, but is it safe for a solo female traveler to go in?",

    "postText": "I (25,f) have been wanting to go to Madeira for years now but what\u2019s stopping me is the fact that I am so scared of renting a car alone.\n\nI have been driving for 7 years, no problem whatsoever, I drive pretty confidently, never had an accident or accidentally scratch my car\n\nthe problem is I am scared I am gonna dent the car or scratch it or Idk messing it in some way and I\u2019m scared they will make me pay for damages and I can\u2019t really afford to pay 1k-2k-3k + for reparations\u2026\n\nAgain, I never had a single problem so far but I am scared maybe I\u2019ll mess up because I panic since I have to get used to a new car or maybe I\u2019ll have difficulties on steep roads or narrow roads.\n\nSo, here my questions:\n\n1) how difficult are roads in Madeira?\n\n2) had anyone ever faced ridiculous high charges because of a accidental damage while returning the car?\n\n3) will the insurance cover damages if it\u2019s my fault? will it cover damages from third parties or natural causes (let\u2019s say a branch fall on the windshield and break it, will I have to pay for that?)",

Most places have an option that means any damage to the car is covered by buying their extra coverage.  It\u2019s going to cost a little bit but so much less that 1000\u20ac for paying the damage out of pocket.  They sell it as peace of mind for exactly this reason",

Chances are the credit card you are using has a perk that includes all the insurance necessary and it's a good savings. I use it all the time and I unfortunately have even totaled a car in a nasty accident years ago. All covered. They prey on you for additional services and add-ons at the counter..\n\nGo online, find what you need, compare different sites, different cities to pick up and return to and different dates if possible The rates can vary widely.. lately I've used sixtus but overtime all of them...\n\nCheck your credit card and see if collision and theft are included if you use the card to rent the car. This is quite normal stateside not sure if it's so elsewhere.. and it works and it pays.. liability is  required by the EU and that is usually included in the rate charge. Lately I have noticed that some rentals include everything including collision theft.. But the devil's in the details and read and inform yourself... Don't get bullied into paying any more than you need to. Rarely is it advantageous to pay for the last fill up of gas, rather fill up an hour or so before you bring it back 10 km or so from the return station.. they get you on the extras, don't use them if you really don't need them",

            "comment": "You have lots of good practical advice here. As a somewhat nervous (but good!) driver, renting my first car was very stressful for me. I had the same concerns as you. I really think it\u2019s something you get used to in time, and I\u2019d encourage you to go for it even though you\u2019re nervous. I would suggest practicing driving some different cars at home if you have trusted friends/family and that\u2019s okay for you insurance-wise (not sure where you\u2019re located and I know that varies). It will just help you to get a feel for adjusting to new cars in a familiar situation vs. new car and new driving situations at the same time. As others said, you can get extra insurance to cover issues that might come up. Hopefully you won\u2019t need to use it but it feels good to have. Then when you get the rental car, take your time to get to know it a little bit. Take pictures of any existing damage, though the company should as well. Figure out where everything is, how to use the different features you might need, etc. before you leave the lot. If there\u2019s anywhere nearby like an open parking lot, take it for a spin there to get a feel for the size, turning, mirror placement, and all that good car stuff. It might sound a little silly but it helps to get some of the nerves out. Have a lovely trip! Oh, and it might sound obvious but remember to get an automatic if you need one!",

Yes, the rental car company damage waiver insurance is a bit more expensive but you literally do not have to do anything if you damage the car.

Funnily, as a Portuguese person who went to Madeira once and wants to go back as a grown-up, the need of renting a car is one of the reasons I haven't gone back yet. Madeira is probably the place (from what I visited) that scares me the most when it comes to driving, mostly because I feel having a car there is important.\n\nMy father rented a car in Madeira before, and it was nice. However, some of the streets were scary (driving in the mountains) and I wouldn't want to drive there as a newbie tbh. Just as driving to Serra da Estrela can be a bit intimidating because of that, to me. \n\nI feel having a car is another kind of freedom in Madeira, because it allows you to visit deeper. The last time I visited, there wasn't much transportation. Now it can be different, though.\n\nIf you are used to driving and can buy insurance, maybe you should try it. Comments here are positive. But just google it and make your decision. Maybe ask some Portuguese subreddits as well.",

Instead buy car rental excess insurance from a separate company, it's way cheaper! If you have an accident you pay the upfront cost and claim it back through the insurance or (sometimes) they pay it direct.\n\nAs for renting a car, better to do it than to live with the fear of it. Be careful, plan your routes in advance, don't take any crazy risks, and you'll be fine\n\nAlso, take photos or a video when you pick it up and point out any existing damage to them before you sign anything so they know what it's like beforehand",

I think the whole rental car industry works on a model designed to screw over its customers.\n\nI have rented cars a few times where it was the only option. Once the excess for damage was worth more than the car itself. Even the guy handing over the keys admitted it was ridiculous.\n\nBe very very careful about insurance. My credit card travel insurance covers NOTHING to do with cars. If I had a specific trip planned using a car I would look for other insurance.\n\nI did rent a car earlier this year and I paid for every bit of insurance they offered. It double the price but I was sharing the cost with a travel companion. If I was travelling alone I probably would have stuck to public transport. I hear people say rental agency insurance is not worth it, but I didn't feel like I had any other option.",

When I dropped it off at the airport the guy noticed the damage but we had paid for insurance. Never cost me a penny. One time when I was in Bali somehow someone knocked our passenger side rear view mirror off. When we dropped the car off the company asked for 20 bucks to repair it. I gave him 20 bucks and went on my way. Sometimes damage to a rental car makes for good stories.",

    "postText": "Recently, I visited a handful of European cities (to name a few Seville, Lisbon, Prague). I'm travelling on a budget as well so I was very selective with the attractions I chose to pay for, and I didn't pay extra for audio guides. At the end of my trip, I found some cities to be quite boring because I felt seeing cathedrals, churches, castles and viewpoints of the cities was very repetitive and mundane. I did enjoy Porto a lot tho, it didn't have as many tourist attractions compared to other cities but the food and people there were the best\n\nI feel like I am doing Europe wrong and before I continue going to other European cities, i was wondering how to elevate my trip without paying exorbitant amounts for every tourist attractions in each city. I'm thinking of paying extra to get audio/tour guides so I can learn the history of the cities more this time. Hopefully, this will make the next few cities more interesting, but I would also like more suggestions (that do not include clubbing/drinking) to make my Europe trip more fun because I think Europe is interesting, I'm just doing it wrong :&gt;",

He also has free audio walking tours on his app (including for Lisbon and Prague). The books will also give you a sense for which museums, monuments and structures really are unmissable even for the casual tourist.\n\nThe Wikipedia article for each place can also be surprisingly useful for cramming hundreds or even a couple millenia of history into something you can consume in 10-20 minutes of dry prose.",

I don't think it's necessarily fair or within the rules of the subreddit to expect others to plan out an itinerary for you that'll make Europe less \"boring\" for you, but some ideas of things you could consider might be hiking in the Swiss Alps or the Italian Dolomites, visiting some of the picturesque towns of the Amalfi Coast or the Greek Islands, or seeing some of the arctic scenery of Scandinavia (Lofoten Islands for instance)\n\nBut also consider the \"wherever you go, there you are\" universal advice of traveling. If you're in a big foreign city and can't think of any way to keep yourself entertained, that might be something to work on. In any major city (and plenty of small towns) you ought to be able to google \"best food in this city\" or look for live music or try to see if there are any day trips nearby to local hikes or things like that. It's a good skill to find ways to keep yourself amused even if you're in a location that's not your favorite",

The \u201cbest of\u201d ones are a good way to get oriented. You should Google for the best reviewed tour companies in your city, but for instance, Walkative is a network across many cities. The ones by licensed guides do tend to be better. If you\u2019re on a budget, those free tours can be a great value (please tip what you can though). The tour guides also often have cheap, good restaurant and bar suggestions too. \n\nTour guides (or audio guides) are an easy and efficient way to learn, especially if you\u2019re interested in not just the site/object itself, but also the culture and people behind it. Sometimes even paying $20 for a tour is well worth it if you\u2019re interested in a particular theme or area.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to buy a guidebook (echo u/slakmehl on Rick Steves helping you prioritize and free audio tours), use your library for free ebooks to download to your phone. \n\nThere is definitely church and castle fatigue. You don\u2019t have to go to all of them. Research ahead to see if it\u2019s worth your time to go inside then.",

Here are some things I've done in Europe and a few i would recommend:\n\n\n* Hike around the Norway fjords\n* Hike the alps (i did the tour du mont blanc, ~170km and hikes in Zermatt and Interlaken in Switzerland)\n* 3 day camping/canoe trip through estonian bogs\n* Go somewhere during their big festival (Nice carnival, Valencia las fallas, Basel Fasnacht, etc)\n* Croatian road trip including the Plitvice waterfalls\n* Road trip/visit northern Ireland near the Giants Causeway\n* Seek out specific things to eat\n* Those free walking tours\n* Seeing a concert \n\n\nOther ideas\n\n* bungee jump in Switzerland \n* I think you can solo skydive with an automatic parachute in Switzerland too\n* Hiking in the Dolomites in Italy\n* Visiting antique/junk markets (besides curious gawking you have outdated world maps, English novels published in USSR edition, etc)\n* Schlittenfahren in the winter (like skiing down a mountain but on a wooden sled)\n* Rollercoasters (Shambhala coaster in Spain)\n* Go to a popular exciting event that you usually have no interest in (formula 1, boxing match, performance art, bathhouses)\n* Visit graves of notable people that matter to you (eg i visited oscar wilde)\n* Visit historical significant places like Waterloo and Normandy and Auchwitz \n\n\nEveryone travels to take in the architecture, the art, food and history. Culture is experienced in varying degrees. But most of these activities boil down to just \"looking at stuff\".\n\n\nIt's okay to get bored with \"looking at stuff\" even when the stuff is beautiful. There's nothing wrong if you skipped on a guide and learned very little history because it's your trip and you're not obligated to do anything you don't enjoy.",

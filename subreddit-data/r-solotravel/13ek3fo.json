Or any other operators they recommend? \n\nThanks!",

I was the youngest by a bit at 21 but it was mostly couples through from 25ish to their 50s (young but old at heart, and old but young at heart), definitely not a big party scene but the option is there to go out and have drinks or etc as you want. We usually went out as groups to cocktail bars on the beach or just grabbed drinks but you dont need to when you just want a quieter night. :)) hopefully that helps!",

All excursions were great minus canyoneering - it was just way too long and they didn\u2019t provide us with any water for the entire afternoon.  I heard zip lining was great though",

Drink prices on board were around 12-15 euro for cocktails from memory - I can\u2019t remember for wines and etc sorry but because of the vibe of the cruise it works out that you dont really drink much on the boat anyways and its easier to go somewhere on one of the towns you stop at. :)",

If I did it again at 37 I imagine I would not do Navigator. \nA few nights we were docked up with other sail croatia boats so you could mingle a bit if you'd like, depending on itinerary.",

    "postText": "I land in Bangkok first and I am looking of spending around 10 days in Thailand, currently I am thinking about 2/3 days of Bangkok, night train to Chiang Mai for the rest of the 10 days before flying to Bali from Chiang Mai. I can\u2019t really extend the duration in Thailand so I am not sure if I should even make my way up north for such a relatively short amount of time. On Bali I spend a week or so before going to Vietnam.\nHere I am conflicted. Originally, I wanted to spend ~1month in the country, going from south to north. However, I have seen many people hating on the south, so an alternative would be to spend around 2 weeks in the north and then travel to South Korea for 2 weeks, before going to Japan afterwards. I am leaning towards staying 4 weeks Vietnam and maybe just skipping the south, but happy for any input. \n\nSo my plan right now is:\n10 days Thailand, 2 of those in Bangkok, night train, Chiang Mai for the rest\n7 days Bali, 4 weeks (north) vietnam, 4 weeks japan",

Bali is very heavily developed and touristy\u2026 Siem Reap is, too, but Angkor Wat is way more spectacular than anything on Bali. If it\u2019s beaches you\u2019re after, you can find nicer ones in the Gulf of Thailand, in both Thailand and Cambodia, than on Bali.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone. I'm on day 3 of my 2 week Turkey trip. Its my first solo experience, and my first hostel experience as well. \n\nI'm finding it really hard to integrate myself into the group. There are only 2 social areas, a small indoor area and a slightly larger but still small outside area. When i get back to the hostel, most of the time, theres a group outside all chatting ect. I think i'm struggling to just get out there and sit down, because if i were to go out there, i'd have to sit right smack bang next to them on the table, which feels crazy intimidating. I cant tell, but i think they're all basically friends already?\n\nNobody that ive noticed has really just spent alone time at the hostel in their bed. Would it be weird if i just laid in bed and went on my phone/wrote in my journal and didnt go into the communal area? How do i even get the courage to sit at the communal area??\n\nIts getting to the point that i'm dreading going back to the hostel\ud83d\ude2d",

Mostly everyone there are strangers, just like you, just looking to experience the world, meet new people. Obviously there are a few that like to keep to themselves, but even they're usually down for a little chat. It's the hostel life. If someone really didn't want to be social, they'd most likely get a hotel.",

It's like dating, you'll met lots of interesting people but if you don't vibe just move on if you desire the social outlet. Party hostel crowd is super affable even if you don't drink.",

I (American guy) played pool at the bar and met lots of cool people. One guy was from Turkey, so I picked his brain because I had a trip to Cappadocia planned the following month. \n\nThis month I'll be in Barcelona, staying at the Kabul Hostel. I chose it because it seems social and they organize events for their guests. I seek out places that look fun, social and will give me the opportunity to meet new people.

There are frequent posts here about people on solo trips, depressed, alone, and saying they're thinking of going home early.  So don't be that person who hasn't contemplated that solo travel might remain solo travel even after you get to your destination.",

First time solo traveler here. \nHonestly, I realized that I am not made for hostels because I am a digital nomad and Airbnb/private space works better for me. So, I shifted. But, again, that's a personal choice. About the social aspect, you really don't need to go out there and talk to anyone if you don't feel like. I spent 3 miserable nights thinking about the fact that everyone is enjoying at the bar and I am just sitting inside my dorm watching Netflix. Infact, I wanted to read a book too but that became kinda impossible with all the bar noises. I might go back to hostels someday when I am already with a group of friends and not traveling solo. But, it's a no for me rn. Mostly because I saw that most people at these hostels were just looking for hookups/weed. I don't smoke, drink + I have a really healthy, happy relationship so hostels are useless for me. + I like conversations that are meaningful. Stupid, pointless small talk is just not for me. So, I'd rather connect with other nomads through networking events than play pool or drink beer with people who have no interest in my life whatsoever. \n\nMy advice to you: Don't feel bad for writing in your journal or just scrolling your phone. It already takes a lot of mental courage to go on a solo trip, that too for the first time. So, it's fine if you just want to use your phone at the end of the day. I personally hate this 'heyyyyy let's do something crazyyy we are on a tripppp' energy. Solo trips are not glamorous as people portray them. They are really difficult for people who've been away from home for a long time. So, hang in there. And  Just focus on wholesome things that make you really happy:))))",

            "comment": "I definitely know how you feel. I\u2019ve never stayed at a hostel and am too old for them now, but the social aspect of solo travel is something that I find hard to overcome. I\u2019m an introvert and have some social anxieties, but I would still like to be able to mingle with people when I\u2019m traveling. I\u2019m not looking to make lifelong friends or have crazy adventures, but often in the evenings I feel isolated or like I\u2019m missing out because I don\u2019t have people to enjoy the nightlife with, and I don\u2019t feel comfortable going to bars and such alone. \n\nI think the worst was when I stayed at an all inclusive resort in Cancun alone; I loved lounging around the beach solo all day, but once the sun went down and the beach closed around 5:30, it was a long and isolated evening ordering room service. The resort\u2019s restaurants were bustling with couples and families all night and I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable being solo in that setting. \n\nI\u2019ve done Tokyo solo and most evenings I signed up for group food tours, which was a nice way to enjoy some nightlife and meet people in a more structured setting, and I stayed out late with some people from the tour and met up one person a couple of nights later for a drink. \n\nAnyway, apologies that I don\u2019t have better advice, but I do understand where you\u2019re coming from. There\u2019s nothing wrong with staying in bed doing your own thing if that\u2019s what you want to do, but I do understand feeling like you\u2019re missing out by not being social.",

If they seem intentionally cold to you, just go back to your own planning. If not, then show your appreciation and start asking them questions about their travels. Most people will respond in kind so be prepared to briefly talk about your situation. Write down stuff that sounds interesting and keep chatting - but try to ask more than you tell unless you have really good stories. Then if the conversation's flowing, see if they have any more immediate plans for the evening.\n\nNow here's where you need to consider social circumstances because you should ask if you can join them if the situation is right. If it's a large group of people, go for it. If there's two people and they seem into each other, do not ask to join that pair. If any of the groups are solidly women, you may want to tread lightly if you're a guy who comes across as straight unless they're the only other people there or they're going to a larger event like a festival, concert, club, etc. And please please please take the first \"no,\" no matter how they convey it.\n\nAnyway, before you leave, make a plan for getting back, whether that's leaving the event early, or sticking with the group, or finding people in the group should you lose track of each other while out and about.",

But in your situation just literally go and sit down smoke a cigarette it may be awkward at first but just ask where everyone's from and from then on its easy you engage in typical hostel talk for 10 min and after that ask if they are up to anything tn. I used to be that guy in bed at 6pm but nowdays I've been really trying to be social and let me tell you it will lead to experiences and people that will make your trip 10x better. Sometimes the hostel isn't great for socializing tho so in that case just plan your activities and enjoy your trip. Being solo is amazing but a mix of both is definitely the best option.",

I was alone when I wanted to be and surrounded by people if I chose to. You obviously have the courage to leave home and travel on your own. A lot of people would like to do that and never do. Just be yourself. I have great memories of people I only knew for a few hours or days as well as people I got to know very well when I had to stay somewhere and work. Just live for the moment and enjoy your freedom. I am 65 and own my own home now. When I travelled the only possessions I had fitted into my backpack. I definitely plan to go travelling again when I retire  and that is because I gained the confidence to buy a plane ticket, and disappear for a while. Hope this helps.",

See where the conversation goes. Common intro questions are where is everyone from, how long have uoy been here, how long are you staying. If you like the hostel, say something positive you like about it. Even ask them what they've done so far in the city and what they'd recommend. If they do know each other already, ask where they met. Good luck",

What I slowly learnt was to just do whatever you want. \n\nIf you want to chill and be an introvert, just go and lie in bed. Nobody\u2019s gonna care. I literally went to sleep at 9pm one day because I was dead tired. \ud83d\ude02\n\nIf you need some company, just talk to anybody! If they\u2019re in a group, just say hey and plop yourself with them. They will slowly start to ask you questions! Most people are solo travelling and will probably be keen to talk :)",

The worse that can happen is you get the cold shoulder and then you know they're an established and closed group. \n\nIf you chill on your own where there's more free seating, sooner or later another solo traveller or small group will show up and before you know it you'll be talking. \n\nAlso not strange at all to just chill on your bed and do your own thing. \n\nYou are you. You're in control of what you do and it doesn't matter what others think - the truth is they're not even thinking about you (in terms of judging your actions etc.)",

The SOB who approached me on the metro babbling about the \u201ctermini\u201d (Rome train station) was the distractor, while his accomplice, probably, unzipped bag and snagged phone.\n\nThey\u2019re very slick, like magicians. I heard about three other cases of stolen phones in Italy, and a women on the flight back who had her wallet snagged out of backpack in Venice \u2014 3 CC cards and $3000 gone! But what fool travels with that kind of cash in one lump? If my leg had been broken and an eye blinded, I couldn\u2019t have felt worse. Ability to communicate, navigate, all AirBnb, train and activity reservations gone.  With no companion to help me out. What saved my ass: multiple paper backups with all that info, contacts, reservations, etc. I bought a cheap new phone with an Italian #, created a new Google account, which allowed me to install WhatsApp so I could call anywhere (back home) without a contract international plan from the Italian TIM company.\n\nThe second thing that saved my trip: those paper backups and wallet with CC cards and most of my cash in a money belt, worn with the pouch on my belly. DO NOT wear it with the pouch on your back \u2014 it\u2019s too vulnerable to being unzipped and picked. This is why I saw many travelers in the train stations wearing their backpacks on their chests \u2014 to deter the pickpockets. Italy has a reputation for being a bit more dicey than Spain \u2014 it\u2019s true.",

Phone case would be just the phone and some cash. I found out in Spain that's all you really needed, everywhere accepted card (tap to pay with phone), cash as backup, and no one ever checked for ID really. When I went out at night I'd usually only carry this. Cash goes in pants pocket in case phone gets stolen. \n\n\n2. Wallet would be a little zip wallet that went in my fanny/sling. Contained my \"normal\" things, in this case just an ID, credit card, debit card, cash/coins. \n\n\n3. Backup wallet would be deep in my backpack, locked away at the hostel, would have backup ID, backup credit card, backup debit, backup cash ($100 USD). \n\n\nThe ID scenario is a little tricky on when you need to carry your passport, but it would either be locked in the backpack or with my in my sling. So only thing in my pockets ever would be my phone. Only one pocket to be aware of in busy streets. \n\n\nAlso photocopy of passport in backpack, digital copies on email or cloud.",

                    "comment": "Fact! On my first solo tour across Mexico 40 years ago, I had only a guidebook with maps and a compass. No advance reservations for anything. Just show up and ask for vacancies, or call around on coin-operated pay phones. There were always vacancies for lodging, and on trains and buses. I traveled like this for many years, enjoying the freedom from a schedule -- I could linger on in a city or village I liked, without worrying about the next leg of the trip\n\nBut tourism has exploded in the last several decades. All the hotspots, from Venice and Barcelona to Arches and Zion Nat. Parks here, are overflowing now, even in the formerly \"off-season\" months. You have to have reservations, or you might be sleeping under a bridge, or pay exhorbitant rates at some 5-star hotel. And you really have to have a phone to manage all of this --- like it's increasingly necessary to manage your entire life!\n\nLose it, and you realize how dependent we've become. I still carry paper guidebooks with good maps and a compass -- they helped me navigate without the phone.",

It's impossible to travel without a phone nowadays -- you can hardly find some AirBnBs without Google maps, or even get into them without a phone.

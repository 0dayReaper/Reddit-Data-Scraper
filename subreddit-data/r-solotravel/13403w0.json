    "postText": "Having my first solo trip and I'm bloody excited for it might I tell you.\n\nAlthough I have a few question I want to ask\n\n- I am not getting the Osprey 40L backpacks since they are quite expensive where I live, so I am getting myself a  suitcase/carry on that'll have like 25kgs of clothes and necessities. And also a normal college-type backpack. \nMy question is: how do hostels in Malaysia and Vietnam handle the storage for it? Would I've a tough time with it where having a backpack like osprey is a must? I hope not. \n\n- How is the internal flight booking situation in both Vietnam and Malaysia? Since I have not booked any tickets for going from city a to city b, do they get really expensive where you recommend booking before hand? \n\n- What were some things you wjsh you knew before going on a solo trip and do you have any advice/things I need to know before I enter the countries?\n\nI'm planning to live strictly only in hostels, I won't be cooking, I'd be eating from local restaurants and cafes and what have you, I've international health insurance provided by my company I work at, I will use grab as my mode of transport, I won't drive at all.\n\nUpdate 1: \n\nHi everyone, thank YOU EVERYONE so fucking much for your responses. I will try to get back to most of yalls responses tomorrow. \n\nA bit more context would help: I've to attend some official events where I'd need to dress well and look \"decent\" so I need to carry a few bit of clothes. It's the only big concern why I'm thinking of using a carry on. Other than that are all basic necessities. Although I don't think I'll have 25kg load of things that I'll be carrying with me. But I booked my initial to and fro flights just as a precaution. Here are the things I'm to carry: electronics kit(charger, powerbanks, 3 phones, headphones etc), Hygiene kit, 4 pairs of jeans, 6 tshirts, 2-3 shirts, 1 sweatshirt, 1 jacket, 3 shorts, 2 joggers, med kit, towels and some other things I can't remember.\n\nI am also to be traveling for a little less than a month where 80% is solo travel, 20% is work. Luckily I'm not going to carry a laptop or a camera. \n\nI agree with all of you on the laundry part, I'll 100% be doing that. It's just the official work that I'm going for is making me a little bit crazy.\n\nI also did look up some backpack options but none of them so far seem as good. They all have shitty reviews on Amazon. \n\nAnother reason why I'm hesitant with osprey is for the rest of this year I don't see myself solo-travelling...so do I bother investing now?\n\nIf I'm being fucking stupid above just say it to my face I'll accept \ud83d\udc4d\n\nAlso, few more questions:\n\n- do I need travel insurance if I already have international health insurance?\n- my very intellectually smart self booked both landing and departing flight from Ho chi minh city. Am considering to move the departing flight to hanoi. I already got my evisa for Vietnam. In that I mentioned departing airport as Ho chi minh. I'd be reasonable to think that I can leave from hanoi still right? Or is this too strict/not allowed?\n\nAlso need to figure out if my flight(emirates) will allow me to change my location for the flight. Any tips, are HAPPILY WELCOME!",

I'm assuming you're from the states or Europe where you live a certain routine and don't often meet people. On a solo trip you'll meet possibly dozens of new people (other travellers and locals) on a weekly basis and can form some incredible friendships, so definitely be prepared for how incredible some of the social interactions can be.",

Pack some synthetic stuff that you can wash in the sink and hang dry.\n\nVietnam:  Talk to the locals.  Those kids who want to talk to you around Hoan Kiem Lake in Hanoi are students who want to practice their English.  Give them some time and tell them you would like to be shown around Hanoi.",

You didn\u2019t say how long your trip will be but, ironically, the longer it is, the less things you need to bring as you will have to do laundry anyways. That suitcase will become a burden and is one of the best ways to get travel burnout and wanting to never get out of your room/hostel",

I then put large amounts of money in a flat wallet that I put under clothes so it\u2019s hard to pickpocket and everything else in a cross body satchel. If you do that you can leave your backpack at the accomodation with no fear of it getting stolen and if it does it\u2019s only a minor inconvenience because clothes and backpacks are cheap. There\u2019s no need to bring check luggage at all. If you keep your valuables always on your body there\u2019s far less chance of them getting stolen. You can wash your clothes every day if you want for 20,000kip per kilo. I\u2019m currently solo in Laos and that\u2019s perfect for me.",

You should be able to find something online, or local companies / a global chain like Decathlon should have something in the 40L size.  \n  \nThis isn't just for hostel storage - if you're going to be booking short haul flights just having a backpack you can store in overhead compartments is going to save you having to buy luggage allowances for those flights.  Plus if you're going to be moving around lots of cities just having a backpack is going to make things so much easier.  \n\nAs to storage, hostels will generally tend to assign each visitor a storage locker in the dorm room.  The suitcase may fit but I'd just go backpack.  \n\nThe flight booking will depend on where you're travelling.  If you're looking at popular routes there'll probably be several flights available, but if it's something rarer than there may just be one or two flights per day, and I'd recommend booking ahead.",

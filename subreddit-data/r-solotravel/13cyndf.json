    "postText": "So for a bit of background, I will be turning 18 this summer and I have always dreamed of traveling through central/ South America before starting university in the fall\u2026 I can speak Spanish fluently and have travelled a couple times alone for school/ volunteer opportunities. My parents are worried (understandably) and are super against the idea but I know that I will be much happier and content in university if I get to live this childhood dream out before starting. So am I too young?",

            "comment": "18 you are legally and adult. However, In some. Places, mostly the US you won't have access to alcohol.\n\nPutting that aside. What is your maturity level?\nHow pampered (cocooned) have you been? Where have you traveled on your own around home? Have you lived on your own? \n\nAre you responsible with alcohol and drugs? There is close to a 100% chance that you'll be offered and will be around people who use. It's not the same getting drunk or stoned in a \"safe\" and familiar environment than in an unfamiliar place around strangers where laws may be different. \n\nHave you had proper (not religious) Sex education?\n\nAre you comfortable with different cultures, foods, people? \n\nI'd say go. At that age it will be an amazing trip and whether you are already mature (based on your parents reaction they seem to think you aren't) or just opening your wings, you'll learn a lot and mature faster than being at home.\n\nYou are right wanting to go. Just ensure you are willing to be mature enough so you don't end up in trouble.",

I\u2019ve been to parties and stuff and always hate how I feel after drinking and I\u2019ve never ever been interested in drugs despite being offered and around people who do it so not really a problem for me. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019ve been pretty cocooned throughout my life especially by my mother. In fact, I had an opportunity for a project abroad and had to decline due to my mother feeling \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with the idea. Anytime I ask she says \u201cit\u2019s not you I don\u2019t trust, it\u2019s other people.\u201d And the conversation usually ends at that. I\u2019ve been a straight A- student athlete my whole life and have had a couple of \u201csituationships\u201d and guys interested in me but I\u2019ve never been one to sleep around (not that that\u2019s a bad thing, just not really my vibe) so I\u2019ve never given my parents a reason to not trust me or think of me as immature. \n\nThe main reason I want to go is to explore my own culture. I\u2019ve grown up here in North America but was born abroad. I really want to go and seeing people encouraging me is definitely pushing me to have another serious conversation with my parents about this topic.",

Having that said, like myself, I\u2019d assume you\u2019d want your mothers approval out of love and respect. My mother was against me traveling at first for the same reasons as your mother. After many calm and productive conversations, always sharing my location, flight numbers, accommodations, and overall continuously providing reassurance, not only did she warm up to the idea, she thinks it\u2019s the coolest thing ever and is my biggest motivator now.",

I know of people much older that stand no chance backpacking or traveling just due to the way they behave. If you\u2019re a person who does the research, is carful and aware, and especially being fluent in Spanish (which we weren\u2019t at all) you\u2019ll be fine. Locals are also always happy to help, but yet again do research beforehand to avoid any scams. \n\nTravel is an education within itself, learning to organize, manage stress or other emotions, problem solve, logistics, there are so many thing we both took away from this experience and continue to learn traveling new countries. \n\nSo really the answer is no. No you\u2019re not. But it\u2019s not really the age that matters in these situations.",

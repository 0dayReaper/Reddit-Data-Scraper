    "postText": "I'm from Michigan and I plan on leaving a week from now to stay for 7 days. During the trip, I'd like to experience both the natural wonders and the nightlife (huge fan of live music!). I plan on staying 3 days on the eastern side of the state, potentially Knoxville, to explore the mountains and trails. I think I'd like to spend another 2 days in Nashville and I don't really have a plan for the other 2 days but that's what I'm here for! I am self admittedly not the most experienced traveler and have never done a solo road trip before, but this is an idea that I have committed to haha. This is obviously a very loose, unorganized plan, so I would love to hear any tips and suggestions including trails to hike, routes to drive along, restaurants to check out, areas to stay at, cool events going on, historic sites, and honestly anything broad or specific that you think would be helpful!\n\nThings to note/ other things I would like to do\n\n* I am a 23 year old male\n* I'm not an experienced hiker but I am in good shape\n* My budget is around 1500$\n* I would like to train at least once at a nice BJJ gym\n* I would like to go golfing at a decent course\n\nThank you guys :)",

Both have a TON of spots. I highly recommend Vinyl Tap. It's a small half record store half bar/music venue with pretty good live music and great people.\nStay clear of North Nashville &amp; Madison, for safety reasons.\n\nAny other thing you'd like to see just lmk and I'll do my best to think of some more spots.\n\nCountry Hills golf in Hendersonville/Gallatin area was a wonderful course, really enjoyed it.",

    "postText": "PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE UPVOTE FOR VISIBILITY. \nThe Taal volcano is said to be expecting an imminent eruption. NAIA and Clark have closed airports. If worst comes to worst (maybe I\u2019m just panicking here) the Philippines will essentially be shut down by air. \n\nI\u2019m in the UK with work right now and my wife is heavily pregnant with our son, due on Wednesday 22nd. To put it plainly, I NEED to be in Manila by then. I don\u2019t care how much it costs or how way out the trip will be. \n\nAnyone have any suggestions on how to get there via boat etc?? I\u2019ve done a few searches and can\u2019t really find anything. I\u2019m tempted to book a cruise and get off in anywhere in the ph, but I believe they\u2019ll skip port due to the ash.\n\n\nTL;DR- need to get to Philippines before 22nd for birth of my son, can\u2019t fly due to Taal. Don\u2019t care about costs or logistics as long as I\u2019m there on time.",

Otherwise, I don't know of any ferries from other countries to the Philippines (there's plenty once you're there though). I saw one announced a few years ago but nothing recent. Try flying into Cebu or Puerto Princesa, if you can't get in closer to Manila. Cebu has plenty of international flights and PP has some that I know of. There's probably some other airports in the country that won't close and get international flights.  My advice is just relax and realize you can't control when a volcano erupts or when she delivers, but if they do it on the same day you know the baby needs Taal somewhere in its name.",

Have some friends whose flights into Manila today (local flights, but still) are apparently pushing through (as far as we know now). \n \nI'd imagine the situation should improve over the next few days.  \n\nAs to worst case scenario, which is both Manila &amp; Clark Airports being closed for several days (which again I don't think should happen), your best bet would probably be catching a flight to somewhere in the Philippines and taking a ferry from there to Manila.  The issue there is that lots of flights from outside the country into the Philippines tend to go through Manila.  \n\nThe second largest city in the country is Cebu, and it does have a decent number of international connections.  You should be able to get direct flights there from most of the major hubs in the region.  And from Cebu there are direct ferries to Manila, though those are 10 hours rides which I wouldn't recommend if flights were an option.  [Here's](https://www.directferries.com/philippines.htm) a link w/ a listing of the ferries from 2GO, one of the larger ferry operators.  \n\nAgain though, especially that some flights are being let in now, I'd wager that the airports (Clark at least) should be clear in a week.",

            "comment": "OK, barring the idea of being able to catch a commercial flight to the Philippines, are you rich enough and connected enough to be able to catch a military flight over there. Just be sure to compensate the taxpayers.\n\nAgain, if cost is no object, can you buy a plane, hire a pilot (unless you are one)and land on a  field near where your wife is? One problem is, even if you COULD do all that, you don\u2019t want your aircraft sucking in volcanic ash, which would cause your engines to cut out and you would crash. That\u2019s why they shut down airports near volcanic eruptions.\n\nBut you really need to know what you\u2019re doing when shopping for planes and pilots. Plus there\u2019s a lot of paperwork rigmarole (flight plans, permission to land in multiple countries, etc.), especially with having to land and refuel at multiple airports. And in your present hurried state of mind, that\u2019s probably not a good idea, even if you are rich, UNLESS you know EXACTLY what to do in advance, AND how to do it. But you may not have enough time anyway.\n\nHave you thought about the idea of possibly having a Skype/WhatsApp/FaceTime/etc. live video phone connection between you and where your wife has her baby delivered, not only to watch, but also to record the delivery? Of course, the hospital, clinic, doctor, or midwife might not be too keen on the idea. But this is where your largess and connections might help. This would also allow you to conclude your business in the UK without having to cut it short.\n\nIf you were to pursue this \u201ctelevised obstetrics\u201d idea, you may need a friend to help you set it up in the Philippines as well as the expertise to set it up at your end. Even if your wife is tech savvy, right now she\u2019s a bit too preoccupied to stress herself out about this as well. If you\u2019re a tech geek, this should be fairly simple, but if not, this could be a headache in itself. And be sure to test the connection before you go live!\n\nGood luck with whatever you do!",

    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nThanks so much for your previous help with my Colombia trip, it was super super helpful. Amazing country for solo travel and if anybody needs any tips do let me know.\n\nI'm back again as I'm planning a new trip to Slovenia &amp; Croatia, leaving London **June 8th.**\n\nMy full itinerary is ; [https://tinypic.host/i/oGf3c0](https://tinypic.host/i/oGf3c0)\n\nBut for ease of reading my plan;\n\n1. Fly London to Ljubljana\n2. **Ljubljana** 2 days\n3. **Bled** (Bovic) 3 days - some white-water rafting or kayaking\n4. \\-&gt; Ljubljana -&gt; Zagreb\n5. **Zagreb** 2.5 days\n6. **Plitvice** 3 days - canyoneering , kayaking more active stuff\n7. **Zadar** \\- 3 days\n8. **Split** \\- 3 days\n9. **Makarska** \\- 1 day (somewhere to stop off and make the coastal bus less imposing)\n10. **Dubrovnik** \\- 3 days - seems MEGA expensive?!??! 80\u00a3 per night for a 6 bed dorm? more than NY....\n\nI will be coaching / training (where exist) between places, and staying in hostels.\n\nI'll plan some day trips too, and group organised activities (kayaking etc).\n\nDoes my plan sound smart ? - I'm very social, 31M from UK and would be keen to meet people to share experiences with along the way.\n\nAny other tips or ideas? My days are very fluid so not so sure how I should distribute.\n\nThanks!\n\nDan",

            "comment": "Bled is well connected, potentially, if you want to stay on main transport links go:\n\nLjubljana (or immediately go to your next stop - to get the travel done in one day then go to Ljubljana between Bled and Zagreb)\n\n-&gt; Kranjska Gora (very picturesque and some nice short walks w/ acces to Triglav National Park)\n\n-&gt; Bled\n\n-&gt; Zagreb\n\n* a lot of the (better) rafting is in So\u010da Valley - something to weigh up - but it'll take you longer to reach.\n\nIf you can rent a car, within a day of Ljubljana you can easily reach many great places (including Bled, Lake Bohinj, Predjama Castle, lots of nature, wine valleys...)\n\nAlso note Croatia is a long thin country so consider prioritising where you want to go and do/visit stuff so you don't get travel fatigue, and plan a lazy day somewhere so you can have a rest, enjoy a late breakfast etc. to give you energy for the following full days :)\n\nFurther edit: note, Slovenia is pretty much closed on a Sunday except for Service Stations and some restaurants, cafes and bars. So be sure to account for that :)",

Would that be OK if in Bled and had some activity planned?\n\nSoca Valley looks good but sort of the wrong direction to get to zagreb?\n\nThe direct link to Zagreb looks great cheers. The train and coach seem to be just as long and same price so might as well go for train for comfort and to watch out the window ?",

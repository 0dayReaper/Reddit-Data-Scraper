    "postText": "Im in the process of moving to another company and i had to take out my holidays (proportionally) of 7 days before may 22. I have 13 holidays for the rest of the year, which sucks, so I decided to make a longer trip of 12 days in central europe.\n\nHowever as the start date is coming, I feel like im not in the mood for some reason. The transport has been payed already and ofc i will go, but this is the first time for me that I dont really feel exited about it (despite the fact that I am a padawan traveler). It is also a bit worrisome that this is gonna be my longest trip so far.\n\nHave you experienced similar? How the trip turned out in the end? Feel free to share!",

            "comment": "Yeah I had that this year. I felt like I had to go somewhere so as not to waste my leave but also so burnt out the prospect of all the travel and unknown and feeling obliged to be active and sightseeing was daunting. I still had a nice time and enjoyed things but was very very tired still at the end. From that trip my biggest suggestion would be don\u2019t force yourself to do loads out of a feeling of obligation, allow yourself to use the time to rest, eat nice things and get good sleep so you can actually feel somewhat fresh going back to a big change l.",

My advice, don't have an intensive itinerary or anything, and just get to where you're going and wake up on the first day whenever your body tells you to wake up. Once you're awake, you can start planning for the rest of the trip.",

This has probably killed a little of that excitement. \n\nI often feel this way before a trip (I have a lot of anxious energy). Travel can be a bit exhausting anyway but once I get to my destination or even the airport I tend to get that excitement back. It's easy to ruminate before a trip but once you're in it, you just let go and let yourself enjoy everything. \n\nGood luck with the new job and I'm sure you'll still end up having a great time.",

I had very low expectations, and this has been some of the best two weeks of my life. It\u2019s funny that when I\u2019m all pumped before a trip, my expectations are too high, but when I feel like this, it\u2019s usually when the best experiences happen! Where are you going?",

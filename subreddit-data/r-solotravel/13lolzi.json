    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019m looking for a way to make unlimited international calls (not through internet) to US numbers from abroad with best call quality (HD quality if possible).\n\nI found that using VOIP based calling to US numbers such as Google Voice (which is a free VOIP) or voip.ms (paid VOIP) can cause somewhat bad quality which includes low frequency and muffled sound heard by the other side when I talk. \n\nI\u2019m trying to prevent that, and pass a sound that is higher quality similar to what you get when you call from one US cellphone to another US cellphone which results in the highest call quality - HD.\n\nWould appreciate if you have any affordable recommendations that are proven to be reliable and have a good call quality or specifically from your personal experience which is even better.\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nTLDR: How can I make unlimited high quality international calls to the USA from abroad without paying $110-$175 (basic plan + unlimited international day passes) to tmobile/at&amp;t every month? I don\u2019t really need texting and data as much as I need calling...",

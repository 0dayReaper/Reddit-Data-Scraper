I went last year in august in Fez-Meknes-Volubilis-Oukira-Marrakech and I used only taxis from the hotel to travel because its really cheap compared to where Im from. For excursions outside the city / in the desert I booked through my hotel so that someone took us from the hotel to the bus in the morning",

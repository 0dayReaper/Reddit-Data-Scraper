    "postText": "Due recent changes with personal circumstances I have roughly a free month that would like to use to go to Japan. On the way back, since I\u2019ll already be on that side of the world, I\u2019ll take the time to see some friends that recently moved to Singapore. Instead of flying directly (after going down in Japan) I realised it wouldn\u2019t be much more money to add another quick stop, maybe Bangkok but also toyed with other ideas like Kuala Lumpur.\n\nI have a rough draft of the plan, and would love any advice and critique in terms of more/less days in any of the locations, suggestions etc.\n\nFly to Tokyo from the UK\n\n\nStay in Tokyo 7 days\n\n\nOn the last day, train to Kyoto\n\n\nStay in Kyoto 7 days\n\n\nOn the last day, train to Osaka\n\n\nStay in Osaka 5 days (trips to Nara, Kobe, etc)\n\n\nOn the last day, fly to Bangkok\n\n\nStay in Bangkok 3 days\n\n\nOn the last day, fly to Singapore\n\n\nStay in Singapore 4 days\n\n\nOn the last day, fly back to the UK\n\nI have another trip (already booked and planned from the past) shortly after that so don\u2019t have time to stay much more (otherwise I\u2019d love to go like 2 months or more) but do have a couple extra days maybe to spare, if you think it would be of benefit. Maybe one more day in Bangkok or Tokyo (since the first day is the arrival plus I\u2019ll be all jet lagged)?\n\nThanks for any input!",

After some of the comments (which are all great and very helpful, and exactly why I posted here) I was starting to think if it was too long in Kyoto and I would be bored.\n\nBut I\u2019m someone that enjoyed getting immersed in a place, not necessarily running around all the time as a busy tourist, so I think it would be fine. And if you think you have been having a blast there and not enough time to see everything, that gives me more confidence.\n\nRegarding temples and things to see in Kyoto, did you feel you needed to plan/book a lot of stuff in advance? I like to just explore and find things but don\u2019t want to them realise I can\u2019t see things because I didn\u2019t book in advance.",

I could send you a list if stuff I've done in and around Kyoto if you want to get an idea.\n\nI didn't book anything in advance in Kyoto, just looked up closing days but that can wait until the night before! I think the only things you really need to anticipate in Japan if you want to do them are good restaurants (causal ones are fine without reservations), TeamLabs Tokyo and Ghibli Museum, and some of the most popular tea ceremonies / sake tastings etc. Maybe some attractions like Tokyo Skytree and theme parks too but I'm not really into that",

I would say Bangkok is a different trip. Do it with Vietnam and Laos. I did a Tokyo, Seoul, and Singapore trip. Seoul can be done in three to four days. Maybe consider some combination of these countries, adding Hong Kong. Hong Kong and Singapore are both places I am glad were not single destination trips, but worth a visit.",

Of course, if you're more a city person, that's understandable, but Japan has so much to offer outside of city limits. I would plan two or three days to the area of Fujikawaguchiko, to see the majestic mountain. Also probably a day trip to Nikko. \n\nBangkok is interesting, but Thailand's magic also lies in its nature - nature parks, islands, sea shores. If you can budget more days for Thailand, I would advise you to visit an island (Koh Chang for example is a ~6 hours bus ride away) which is so worth it in my opinion. But ultimately it's your choice.\n\nHave fun!",

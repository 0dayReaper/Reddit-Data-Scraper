    "postText": "I am planning my first long term solo trip to central and South America and need some advice! I am looking at traveling to Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. To get to each of these places, I would need to fly since most aren\u2019t accessible by bus from one to the other. When I look at the airlines that fly to and from these countries, they ALL have the worst possible reviews saying they\u2019re a scam. The \u201ctop rated airlines\u201d including Volaris, Avianca, Latam, and Sky Airlines have the worst feedback from 95% of their customers and seem incredibly untrustworthy. I\u2019m really wanting to travel to these places but don\u2019t want to get scammed or stranded, please let me know if you have any advice or experience flying within central and South America!\n\nEdit: by scam I mean horrible service and experience. Things like cancelling flights with no notice and not rebooking, charging for things like checkin when you get to the airport, flights leaving early and not rebooking, customer service that refuses to help\u2026 stuff like that",

Both of the times they did not give me my money back. Should I have booked refundable tickets? Sure.

Like really bad customer service, cancelling flights without offering an alternative, moving flight times with zero warning, having low cost planes for the same high prices, charging for everything, overselling seats, etc etc. They also basically made the largest low cost airline of the country go bankrupt as a way to blackmail the government to let them have a monopoly. \n\nMostly everyone I know has had a bad experience with avianca so if I were you I would try to book with latam, wingo, copa, or even easyfly. If that fails you can fly with avianca (they almost succeded with the monopoly thing so they have most routes and flights) , it is still a large airline so it's not properly a scam, but I'd say there is like 20% chance you will run into an issue of some kind.\n\nPs: use google flights and book directly with the airline",

I also have flown FlyBondi and JetSmart and my experiences were totally fine, no problems. \n\nNot sure where you are flying from initially to get to your destinations, but the one thing I will say is that I have had difficulties flying to South America on a multi-airline flight due to connections, like United partnered with one of the South American airlines, solely because of customer service difficulties. For example, I booked a flight to Argentina through United, but it was a United-Aerolineas Argentinas flight, so I first had a US connection on United and then flew out of the US on Aerolineas. Though I booked the entire roundtrip flight through United on their website and paid United, there were things about the trip that they had no access to or control over, like my seat assignments on Aerolineas. That proved to be a pain because Aerolineas customer service was super hard to get a hold of from the US. But I would imagine these difficulties exist on any kind of partnered/mutli-airline flight, so likely nothing unique to South American airlines. Now I always try to book flights that are just using one airline whenever possible because it's easier.",

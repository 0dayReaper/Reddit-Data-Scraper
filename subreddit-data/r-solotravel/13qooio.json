    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI\u2019m solo traveling to Japan (first time) in June. I arrive on the 9th and fly back on the 25th. My current itinerary is: Tokyo, Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka. I\u2019d be spending 4 days or so in Tokyo and then only 2/3 nights in the other places, so I\u2019m thinking to squeeze in one more city, maybe in between Tokyo and Nagoya. So, any recommendations for a city to visit in central Honshu? Or still fairly close to get to from Tokyo, I guess. I\u2019m especially interested in history and architecture.\n\nAlso on another note, are there any useful apps you recommend downloading that could be helpful along the way? (I don\u2019t speak Japanese)\n\nCheers!\n\nEdit for more context:\n\nI really should have added this, I\u2019m going to Nagoya because I\u2019m meeting a friend who lives near there and works so can only hang out in the weekend. I only plan to stay 1 or 2 nights. So since I need to be in Nagoya on the 17th/18th, I\u2019m looking for a good city to visit/have good day trips on the days right before then after I leave Tokyo. :) \n\nNara and Hiroshima are already on my list for day trips, as well as Mount Fuji and the Himeji castle. I only mentioned the places I\u2019m sleeping in, my bad.",

I'd suggest Hiroshima instead, or spending more time in Tokyo.  Some easy day trips from Tokyo, too, like Nikko or Kamakura.",

            "comment": "Personally I'd recommend cutting down your days in Nagoya (or eliminating it altogether, many people would tell you there isn't much to see there) and adding those days to Tokyo or Kyoto. Kyoto especially since you're interested in history and architecture, and they have lots of temples and shrines.\n\nConsider using your current cities as bases for day trips. Hiroshima is an easy day trip from Osaka. Nara can be done from Kyoto or Osaka. Nikko and Kamakura can both be done from Tokyo.\n\nIf you'd rather spend several days in one place, try Hakone or Kawaguchiko.\n\nAs for apps, I really just used Google Translate and just used the camera function to translate things like restaurant menus or signs.",

Nara was my favorite place I went in Japan and if you\u2019re into history and architecture you\u2019ll love it. Hakone and Kamakura are both kinda in between Tokyo and Nagoya so worth looking into. Also side note, in Osaka get some conveyor belt sushi. It\u2019s a very fun and delicious cultural experience. Have fun and enjoy Japan!",

Naoshima was a cute place to spend a night, Koyasan is a good day trip from Osaka or you could spend a night in a temple.  Since you're not staying in Hiroshima, Bunny Island might not work for you but it's a good day trip from there.",

Also I know it\u2019s probably silly because Hiroshima is no longer radioactive (no more than everywhere else) but as someone who underwent radiotherapy it scares me a little bit. \ud83e\udd72 I feel like it would just be my luck to kick an abnormally radioactive rock or something.

    "postText": "Traveling alone. I\u2019m taking a month long vacation in Europe from 6/4-7/1. My only requirements are that I spend 1 week in Paris until the 12th and leave from Vienna on July 1st. I need advice for what to do in between those 2 spots. Places I really want to go: Mont Saint Michel, Venice, Budapest. I\u2019m pretty open to anything else. Im a big history/architecture nerd (was a Classics major) but also love active activities, and would love off the beaten path things to do. Budget is pretty open. I am planning on taking trains but open to cheap flights. Any advice or potential itineraries would be very appreciated!",

For your travels to Italy I'd suggest looking at the \u00d6BB (Austrian Railways) 'Nightjet' - a sleeper train taking you directly to most big italian cities like Venice, Florence or Rome. \n\nFor Budapest (and maybe Prague in Czechia if your time allows a visit) i suggest the company \"Regiojet\", they offer cheap and comfortable trains to both capitals (3-4hrs travel time from VIE central train station)\n\nI would also suggest the cities of Graz, Salzburg and Innsbruck in Austria, they all share a historical inner city, good train connections and a good days worth of things to do.",

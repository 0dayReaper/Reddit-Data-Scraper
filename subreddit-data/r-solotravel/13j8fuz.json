    "postText": "Not my first time in Europe but first time going solo. (27M) planning to fly out in December. Dates aren\u2019t firm and have some flexibility. After a good deal of lurking I feel relatively confident about my plan but open to suggestions! Budget wise not super tight but likely doing hostels and maybe a night or two in a hotel. Ideally have a good balance of sightseeing and urban exploring, eating and drinking a ton, and a good number of nights out.\n\nDay 1-3: Fly into Madrid, planning day trip to Toledo and generally just exploring the city\n\nDay 4-8: Train to Barcelona, day trips to Girona and Montserrat.\n\nDay 9-11: Train to Granada. Visit Alhambra and stay for Christmas Day.\n\nDay 12-14: Train to Seville. Day trip to Cordoba.\n\nDay 15-18: Train to Lisbon. In town for NYE, likely flying home on Jan 2. Very loose game plan, probably a day trip somewhere.\n\nEdit: Updated Itinerary in comments",

            "comment": "Good priorities. A couple observations:\n\n - Barcelona-&gt;Granada is a pretty long day - around 6.5 hours - and it goes *through* Madrid. If you can start in Barcelona, that would be a ideal. Otherwise, consider heading to Barcelona directly from Madrid on your arrival day - a speedy 2.5 hour train - and seeing Madrid on the way back. \n\n - There is no Seville-&gt;Lisbon train. You'll be taking a bus for a big chunk of it, and it's another pretty long journey. On the other hand, you'll likely be passing through one of Europe's most gorgeous coastlines: The Algarve. Highly recommend putting a couple nights there. For a vibrant more city-oriented experience, stay in Lagos. For a chill, beach-oriented experience, consider Salema.\n\n[Here is 18 days from Barcelona to Madrid](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=barcelona$4$r~madrid$4~cordoba$0$e~granada$2~sevilla$2~lagos$3~lisbon$3$r&amp;trans=Train&amp;nights=18&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;) reflecting those changes. Note that Cordoba is worthwhile for a few hours to see the Mezquita - there are convenient luggage lockers across the street (at a bus station) from a train station you will be passing through anyway.",

I think it would make more sense to cut a day out of Barcelona and stay a night in Cordoba\n\nIf you don't want to stay a night in Cordoba, do. the day trip based out of Sevilla. It will be a 40 minute train ride versus 1.5 hours from Granada\n\nAlso a day trip to Madrid won't be the best way to experience the city.",

            "comment": "In Prague highly recommend free walking tours. I did the VR tour also. Prague has so much culture and history I've learnt so much on two tours and going on my third tomorrow hopefully to see the castle. Im not usually one to love history but the architecture is so interesting the stories behind all of it is quite something. And it adds to building a picture of the culture of czk. Free walking tours are also a great way to meet other solo travellers. The free ones are free to book and then you decide how much you pay at the end. \nDon't exchange money in the street (if someone comes up to you) this is a scam.\nAlso, do not buy anything in the center as far as you can help it\n Avoid ATMs and use \"bankomat\" machines (ATMs that are labelled bankomat. They cost less) \nShops in the centre that say 50 percent off have that sign all year round don't buy from them\nPickpockets are active.\nThe astronomical clock show (every hour) is the 2nd most dissapointing landmark on tripadvisor in the EU apparently. Don't go out of your way but worth looking at. \nPublic transport is excellent! \nI use wise card to easily convert money to a card.\nPrague castle and Jewish museum are top must sees.\nThe mirror maze took me about thirty seconds to complete this morning. Do not spend your time (getting there) or money on it. Check prices of sights before travelling to them.\nAnd if you like massages after all that walking, check out \"happy hour\" deals and travel a bit more of the city. I saw a 30 minute massage for 30 pounds today in the central. Then beside the dancing house, I saw a 10-12pm happy hour deal in another place, for 60 minutes, for 30 pounds. This is a very short tram distance of less than maybe ten minutes.\nBuy the public transport pass! It's about 120 ck per day for all metro tram bus and some ferries. \nUse a currency converter app for quick maths in shops\nI stayed in a \u00a312 a night hostel (plus prague hostel) and a \u00a3100+ a night hotel. The hostel, by far, by far, was superior. Bring a padlock if you go to a hostel or plus offers for \u00a35. Wear comfortable shoes and prepare to walk alot. Czech people I've experienced seem to be nice if you are nice to them. Try using some of the key phrases in their language (thank you, please). And kindness goes a long way e.g. a shopkeeper was very neutral with me and then I typed in Google translate that I loved her shop, in her language. She was beaming! Spread positivity to the people of czk.\nVisit Patrick Juptner's stall - he is an artist, found on the Charles Bridge, and don't take pictures around him! Ask him about his signs at his stall. (The ones about recharging). Say a girl from scotland who visited in may recommended to pay him a visit (i gave him the beer and the orange). He is usually found on the end which is nearest the castle, and sells resin jewellery. He will probably speak to you for a good while and seems to like respectful people alot. Nice to meet the locals.",

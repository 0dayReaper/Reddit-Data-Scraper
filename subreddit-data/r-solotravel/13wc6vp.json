    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nI'm eager to go solo travelling in Eroupe later this year (France, Italy and Spain), however I'm concious of the fact that I'm 27 years old (male if that matters).\n\nIs it weird to go to clubs around this age when solo travelling? I hear lots of good stuff about going to clubs in Germany and whatnot, but I don't want to be weird by being too old going to these places, but at the same time I feel like I'd be missing out.",

A bit all about the flash and pomp - similar to the clubs abroad (or at least in Europe) that usually cater to younger folks looking to 'see and been seen' rather than just having a good time. And the ones that people go to with a few more years on their belt and less interested in that side of clubs just don't really exist there.",

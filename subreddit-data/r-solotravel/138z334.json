    "postText": "Joking about rock bottom - but I *was* recently laid off, and also broke up with my long-term GF. Crazy times. But extended solo travel has always been a goal for me, and I'm thankful to have the financial and life flexibility to do it now!\n\n**Timeline**\n\n* Early June - late December (max - I don't *have* to be traveling this whole time)\n\n**Destinations of interest**\n\n* Italy\n* Spain\n* Greece\n* Balkans! (&lt;-- Heard these are hidden gems, but need specific suggestions)\n* Japan\n* South Korea\n* ...Open to any other suggestions. I speak some Spanish and would be open to South America, but haven't yet researched safety in different regions\n\n**Considerations**\n\n* Experience - Previous solo travel experience in Europe and Japan. Not worried about getting overwhelmed, or discovering that solo travel is not for me\n* Weather - Prefer to avoid places/months that are 80+ degrees for days on end, esp. if the country doesn't have widespread AC. (So maybe Italy / Spain are out for summer, although maybe there are coastal areas that are cooler?)\n* Interests -\n   * Balance of food, nightlife / social, natural beauty, culture and history\n   * I like museums and historical sites, but I max out around 1-2 per day\n   * I'm not put off by crowds of fellow tourists (in fact might be nice to help meet people), so I don't care if I visit a country in high \"tourist season\"\n   * Special events (music festivals, local traditions, big sporting or cultural events) are always a nice motivator for me to get out and immerse myself in a place\n   * I did a group tour company for 20/30-somethings last year, really enjoyed it and would be open to another group tour or 2. If any regions might work better/worse for guided group tours, would love to hear your opinions\n* Pace - Usually like to spend at least 1 week in a city before moving on. Would like to travel mostly by train/bus, and avoid flights between destinations if possible\n* Budget - not a huge consideration. I can thankfully afford most countries as long as I stay reasonable w/ hotels / dining out\n\nOpen to everything: 1-off suggestions, full itineraries, anything in-between. Thanks so much!",

Great views, cool sporting stuff, by the sea, loved it there. A really underrated country in Europe which I also loved was Slovenia. The capital Ljubljana is small but nice city. Then you've got Lake Bled which is this idyllic lake and Triglav national park which is beautiful mountains.",

Medell\u00edn is such a fun city with amazing people, culture, and lots of other travelers. Medell\u00edn might be my favorite city in the world but I won\u2019t get into that. While there, you should join a tour of Comuna 13, an exotic fruit tour, and maybe even a bike tour through the city. I also highly recommend checking out Guatap\u00e9 which is just two hours drive outside of Medell\u00edn. A amazing and colorful town!! While you\u2019re in Colombia, stop by Cartagena up along the Caribbean coast. It does get very hot and humid there (sorry) but I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s worth going for at least a few days. It\u2019s a colonial city with so much history, and a walled section of the city and a cool castle fortress that was built hundreds of years ago. Cafe del Mar (an oceanside bar atop a stone structure) actually still has cannons on the rooftop. Do get out on the water, whether it\u2019s paddleboarding or a sunset cruise. CONGRATS AND ENJOY YOUR UPCOMING TRAVEL ADVENTURES!!! :)",

                            "comment": "As a woman who has been there multiple times, I\u2019d say that safety in Colombia largely depends on a person\u2019s own actions. For example: I don\u2019t recommend just casually walking with your phone out. Phone snatching is still a thing in most of Latin America. I would just check my walking directions and then put my phone in my pocket. However, most of the city doesn\u2019t feel like a high-crime area, it just feels like a big city. The tourist area of Medellin with most of the hostels is called El Poblado and is pretty safe, but it\u2019s still good to use common sense even in nice areas. The biggest safety concern is Tinder - just DON\u2019T use it in Colombia. This is the most serious piece of advice I can give you. Don\u2019t use Tinder anywhere in South America (sometimes there are druggings, etc). And of course, just like with any country, don\u2019t get too drunk and don\u2019t look for cocaine. Those are the typical ways that travelers get themselves in trouble in Colombia. In Cartagena, the same rules apply. Since it\u2019s a beach city, there are more vendors trying to sell stuff, people trying to make money, etc but I just say gracias and keep moving. If you follow the general safety rules (don\u2019t walk with phone in hand, don\u2019t leave phone sitting on a restaurant table, don\u2019t use Tinder, don\u2019t get super intoxicated and wander at night) then you should be just fine! At Los Patios Hostel, I went bar hopping with them on a Friday night (they actually have a party bus) and we ended up walking home from a bar at like 4am in a large group and we were just fine. Sorry for the long-winded reply, but I hope this gives you a better sense of how to prepare for Colombia. Honestly I would apply those same safety tips to anywhere in Central or South America. I\u2019ll be back in Medellin in July, and hopefully will go to El Salvador in December. Happy travels &amp; feel free to ask me anything else. :)",

I think objectifying people wherever they're from and whatever their gender is wrong. It's just as whack when middle-aged British women go to the Gambia to have flings with desperate young men as when middle-aged American men (to pick a well-represented demographic) go to Colombia for the babes. Grossness all around!\n\nIt's fine to date people, have relationships, even sleep around when you travel. My issue is making the presumed hotness of the people in X country (always an overgeneralization and often one based in exoticization/racism) a major travel priority. That's when you get into sexpat and \"pickup artist\" territory and the result is the proliferation of sex pests masquerading as worldly travelers, i.e., Bald and Bankrupt syndrome.",

July and August, the weather is hot and humid and it rains a lot. AC is widespread though at least. \n\nMaybe 1 week in Seoul (including day trip to DMZ). Soraksan is the biggest national park in South Korea. Kyeongju is the ancient capital and the only city in Korea without the ubiquitous high rises. Busan isnt bad, and worth checking out. You might want to also look into going to one of the islands off the coast. \n\nI could easily spend a month in Italy. Itinerary? Well I'll just say that Bologna and Trieste are underrated and both worth visiting. Trieste is a good place to stop on your way to the Balkans (it borders Slovenia). Tuscany's reputation is well deserved. Rome is Rome. I like Milan, but for some reason a lot of travelers don't like it. I don't think I'd want to spend more than a couple of days in Venice.",

Also most trails are still hikable but far less crowded than in peak summer months.",

Macedonia are my favorite Balkans - Croatia has gorgeous sea &amp; country sides. A little investigation will give you many options. You really can't go wrong. Wonderful people.\n\nI love N.Macedonia so much I kept an apartment in Skopje while in Europe. My favorite drive was from Athens to Skopje. GORGEOUS. Make sure you make a stop in Thessaloniki, Greece if you decide to do this via car. Renting a vehicle is easy and the driving is also nice. Just make sure they know that you're crossing the border or there are issues with the rental insurance. I wish I had known - was stopped at the border for hours. Could have fixed it for next to nothing before leaving Greece at the rental place.\n\nThe rich history is incredible. There is a hotel at the top of the hill in Skopje with a glass from floor to ceiling restaurant/club on top. This is where I primarily stay when visiting - and the view is incredible. They are very progressive in MMJ.\n\nItaly - Southern Italy is a breathtaking and so inexpensive. If I were to do life over, I'd raise my children here. Fly into Foggia - visit Bari - go through Camera. Find the water buffalo facility that makes homemade cheese onsite - It's life changing.\n\nOtherwise - Sorrento, Capri, Florence, Arezzo, Anywhere in Umbria - Panicale is delightful.  Taking the train from Milan to Luciano, Switzerland is beautiful and go through Lake Como in Italy and of course the other side of Lake Como in Switzerland. Stunning ride. Of course all the stops in Rome - if you haven't been soak it in - just like you should in Athens.  Venice is lovely if you focus on the local operas. There is one in particular that takes place in multiple rooms  of a palace - it's an exquisite experience.  \n\nSouth America is grand. If you could go in January/February.... I'd do the following: Fly into Lima - hopper flight to Cusco. Of course you'd see the sights - and the airport is a trip. It's also the customs stop for Bolivia - Fly to La Paz Bolivia. Ride the largest cable car. Run the track at the highest elevation futball/soccer stadium in the world. Chew on cocoa leaves to help with altitude sickness.  Go to Uyuni - The salt flats. They are gorgeous in February. From there I'd go to Chile - So much to see here - Even beach penguins.  Uruguay - Monte Video is wonderful, Punte de este - a short trip up is where the hand is in the beach. And it's gorgeous there.\n\nThat should be a great start. Enjoy your adventures internet stranger. It will be a remarkable trip for sure.",

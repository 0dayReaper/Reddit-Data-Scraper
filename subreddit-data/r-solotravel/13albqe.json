    "postText": "Hi there, I'm currently in Italy and already finished visiting most of the touristy places here. I'm planning to visit a few nearby countries(most likely Germany, Austria, Switzerland) in June, but struggling to do a good plan for it. My home base is Bologna, so I was thinking if I should do Bologna-&gt;Salzburg-&gt;Fussen-&gt;Lucerne-&gt;Bologna? Will that be worth it? My budget is $1000(flexible) and maybe 8-9 days of travel. I took trains to all the Italian cities and explored those myself, but I'm confused right now if I should buy a rail pass, book airbnbs/hostels, and travel myself, or just look for any tour groups? All the tour groups seems very expensive. Navigating Italy was easy because my relative lives in Bologna for over 10 years and his valuable suggestions helped me a lot. I don't know how to navigate other european countries though. If someone could provide me a base plan and then I can modify it later, that would be great.",

            "comment": "It's an expensive route, especially by train. \n\n\nYou could do something like go to Courmayeur (Italy) and take the cable car to Chamonix (France). Chamonix (where the first winter Olympics were held) has an impressive cable car that goes up a moutain. Lots of big hikes in this area. Annecy is a cute town that you could day trip to. This is one option for a starting point.\n\n\nAlternatively, you could also stay in Italy and see the Dolomites. \n\n\nSwitzerland is expensive but if you're going to go, Zermatt is more impressive than Lucerne. Your Lucerne stop is probably the most expensive part of your itinerary by far between the travel cost to get to/from there and accommodations. \n\n\nYou chose places that are far apart so you're going to spend more time on trains than exploring. Because they're all different countries and since you only have a few days, a rail pass would still be quite expensive. \n\n\nIt would be better if you chose places that are closer together or have direct train/bus/flight connections.\n\n\n**For planning/logistics**:\n\n\nDon't underestimate busses which are significantly cheaper than trains. Its easy, just google \"Berlin to Prague bus\" for example and you can find &lt;$20 tickets.\n\n\nTo go longer distances, on Skyscanner, you can search one way fares from Bologna and put \"everywhere\" for a destination and you can see a whole bunch of flights for &lt;$50.",

                            "comment": "Google does most of the heavy lifting for figuring out transportation. \"How to get from Salzburg to Hallstatt\", \"how to get around fussen\", \"Lucerne train station to city centre\" usually gives you all the answers you need as well as flags things to watch out for (like last connections, how to buy a bus ticket, metro rules, etc). Generally, it's pretty easy to figure out local transit or google it so i wouldn't worry. Most alpine places are small enough to just walk around anyways.\n\n\nWhere you go depends what type of scenery you want to see and how much effort you want to put into seeing it. Plenty of people don't like hiking or find out they don't like hiking and that's nothing to be embarrassed about. That just means you enjoy scenic places that are easily accessible. \n\n\n\"Nature views\" is tricky for me to interpret. It might mean enjoying picturesque towns with mountains and lakes, seeing views from up high (by cable car and/or hiking), it might mean grassy alpine hills, it might mean being on the mountains themselves.\n\n\nIf you're a hiker, I would go to the Dolomites. I know you're probably itching to travel outside Italy but the Dolomites are an incredible part of the Alps and they're kind of cumbersome to get to unless you're already in that area. (If coming from outside Europe, you have to fly into venice/rome/milan and take a train). Late June is a good time to go. \n\n\nIf you want to see epic alpine nature but not necessarily be hiking every day then collaborate itineraries from other people on the internet. If you're curious about paragliding, bungee jumping, kayaking, etc then you can google where you could do those activities to tailor your trip to your preferences.\n\n\nIf you're unsure where to start, I would pick one of those places that you have on your list (probably the one you're most excited to see) and see how other people have planned full trips around that area. Search things like \"day trips from Salzburg\", \"7* days including Salzburg\", \"trip itinerary Salzburg\", \"hikes near Salzburg\" to research itineraries/logistics that have been successful for others and see if you can plan a compelling trip covering 1 area.\n\n\nNote the 7* days is just an arbitrary number. You can put 10 days or 14 days. It's mainly to view blogs, tour companies and forum posts of travel itineraries which include Salzburg (or whichever place you're researching). This gives you a rough guide of what routes/places/activities other people see when they travel to that area and what transportation infrastructure exists. \n\n\nOne thing you have to consider is that most nature forward destinations aren't usually close to big airports or cities so with a &lt;10 day trip to multiple alpine destinations, I would worry that I would arrive at every destinations exhausted. I imagine I wouldn't get much rest sleeping on the trains/busses/flights because of all the connections. \n\n\n----\n\n\nFrom your list, i have only been to Lucerne. Salzburg is loosely on my list but not super high priority. The Dolomites are very high on my list which is probably why i mentioned it so much.\n\n\nFrom my personal experiences, my favourite \"nature\" trips in europe within your timeframe have been:\n\n\n* Tour du Mont Blanc is a hike through Switzerland, France and Italy. It's 10 days but I could recommend certain portions that were the best.\n\n* Interlaken, Switzerland (if you like hiking)\n\n* Zermatt, Switzerland (easy hiking for great views, perhaps the most beautiful coloured water in the world but $$$$)\n\n\n(Not alps but maybe something you'd consider)\n\n\n* Norway (expensive because I rented a car, but great day hikes, incredible views)\n\n* Road trip in Croatia including plitvice lake national park\n\n* Cote d'Azur (south of France) including les calanques in Marseille and even the islands if you have time. Easy to fly in/out of Nice.\n\n* Northern Ireland (along the road with the giants causeway - maybe not 'alpine-y' enough for you)\n\n* Estonia - a lot of very colourful bogs\n\n* Notable one off places: bastei bridge, Germany; Meteora, Greece; Mount Pilatus, Switzerland (cable car).",

In the direction of the Swiss Alps, **Lugano** makes a pretty stop for a night (though not as interesting as the Dolomites).\n\n(2) For one of the directions I would use a night train for one of the Bologna legs. This lets you do an 'open jaw' itinerary, and saves you the cost of a hotel for one of the nights.\n\n[Here is an optimized 8 nights connecting Bologna and Salzburg](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=bologna$0$e$r~lugano$1$r~gimmelwald$2$r~luzern$0$e~zurich$1~fussen$2$r~munich$2~salzburg$0$e$r&amp;trans=Train&amp;nights=8&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;) via the Swiss Alps, Fussen and Munich to give you an idea of one possible route. At the end, spend a night in Salzburg and all of the following day, then catch the Night Jet home.\n\nAlternatively, you could cut out Switzerland (which is considerably more expensive than the other countries) - [here is a version that substitutes the Dolomites](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=bologna$0$e$r~bolzano$2$r~fussen$2$r~munich$2~salzburg$2$r&amp;trans=Train&amp;nights=8&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;) for Switzerland.

The direct train from Fussen to Salzburg is around 4 hours.\n\nBut for the more relaxed route via the Dolomites, there is a cool city in the mountains of Austria to check out: [Innsbruck could take a night from Munich](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=bologna$0$e$r~bolzano$2$r~innsbruck$1$r~fussen$2$r~munich$1~salzburg$2$r&amp;trans=Train&amp;nights=8&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;), or both if you prefer.

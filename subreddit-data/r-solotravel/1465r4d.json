    "postText": "# Overview:\n\nI am planning a 20 day roadtrip from Central Florida to Zion National Park for July, however I just wanted some advice in case anyone here has tried this before. I think my plan probably isn't that realistic and it's in the rough draft stage, so maybe you can give me some suggestions of what to cut out or some specific places that you've visited along the route that I have planned. My budget is really just for gas, food, hostels, and park fees. I want to spend as little money as possible, but I am flexible if I have to spend a bit more since it is a vacation. I will try to find hostels or camping grounds along the way as I'm driving there and taking stops whenever I feel tired or see an interesting spot.\n\n# Goals, suggestions, advice:\n\nAs I cut from Central Florida to Zion National Park, I want to stop along the places on my route list, however please give me suggestions of which places may be better to go or maybe there are other places I'm not aware of that are interesting. I'm really into nature and the outdoors so I'd prefer to visit nature over cities, however I'd like stop along some cities just to eat or take a break from driving. I'd also like to stop along small towns that have a nice vibe that I'm not aware of just to take a break or for lunch and dinner. Perhaps you can help me with this if you live in an area and are more familiar with some places along my route.\n\nI may have to toss out some destinations and drive straight through some cities. I am open to tossing out my stops at Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia since they are close to home and I could always go back to visit them. I am more interested in visiting Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Texas, and Colorado and would like to prioritize my time in those states.\n\nFinally, is this reasonable to accomplish in 20 days or am I stretching myself too thin?\n\n# Description of the route:\n\nI will start in Central Florida and drive north and skirt along the pan handle stopping at Panama City Beach, then continue west along the gulf coast to Mobile Alabama, then crossing Mississippi, New Orleans, Houston, and then stop at Austin for a bit. Then I'll cut west through Texas and camp at Big Bend National Park in Texas. After that I'll drive north through El Paso, and reach White Sands National Park. Then I'll head north west cutting across New Mexico and North Eastern Arizona to reach Grand Canyon National Park. Then I'll drive up to Zion National Park. I'll cut through Grand Escelante National Park and make my way to Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado. Then finally, I'll drive through the Ozarks on my way back home.\n\n# Route Stopping Points:\n\n***On route towards destination: Zion National Park***\n\n1. Panama City Beach, Florida\n2. Mobile, Alabama\n3. De Soto National Forest, Mississippi\n4. Houston, Texas\n5. Austin, Texas\n6. Big Bend National Park, Texas\n7. El Paso, New Mexico\n8. White Sands National Park, New Mexico\n9. Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona\n10. Zion National Park, Utah\n\n***On return back home: Will cut through the American Ozarks***\n\n1. Grand Escelante National Monument, Utah\n2. Cut through Oklahoma\n3. Cut through Arkansas\n4. Cut through Mississippi\n5. Cut through Alabama\n6. Cut through Georgia",

I'd have liked more time, but you have 3 weeks which i think is doable. \n\nGet a national park annual pass if you don't have one. It will save you a ton. \n\nI loved Capital Reef NP and it's fairly near all the other Utah parks and yet much less busy. \n\nRoadtrippers app/web site was very useful for finding cool stuff along the way. \n\nI'd skip Houston. Not much there to see or do imo.",

If I had someone with me I would have camped, though it was also August and quite hot in the lower elevations.\n\nI went Columbus&gt;Chicago (family in Chi, 1 night)\n\nChicago&gt;Boulder, CO (friends in CO about 3 nights).  Airbnb somewhere near Lincoln Nebraska and maybe one more night in there? This was the most boring part of the trip, IMO. I think I rushed through Iowa except for a rest break at some park with dinosaur fossils, and the largest truck stop in the US. \n\nBoulder-Central Oregon (3 nights on the road) - stayed in Grand Junction, then north of Salt Lake, then near Boise ID. All abbs.\n\nOregon for 5-6 days I think (family)\n\nOR&gt;LA with lots of redwood stops then mostly via the coastal 1. Overnighted near Eureka (abb), then San Fran (family, 2 nights?) then  San Luis Obispo (abb).\n\nA week in LA (family)\n\nLA&gt;Palm Springs (friend, one night)\n\nPalm Springs&gt;Flagstaff (friend, one night)\n\nFlagstaff&gt;Amarillo sometimes on Rt 66, ABB in Amarillo\n\nAmarillo&gt;somewhere in Oklahoma at an abb\n\nOK&gt;St. Louis (ABB)\n\nSt. Luis&gt;Columbus.\n\nIt was a month.\n\nI tried to never drive more than 6 hours a day to leave lots of time for stops. I mananged to swim in some body of water every day as a driving break.\n\nI used the Roadtrippers web site to find that stuff to do along the way, then marked the things on google maps as I navigated.\n\nI was keto dieting at the time so had a couple of coolers in the car and stopped at supermarkets for things like low carb wraps and chicken salad, chhese stick, etc to eat on the road.\n\nMy largest expense was gas (even in a little hatchback), because of all the free stays with friends/family.\n\nThings I did along the way and loved -  the shut-ins in Missouri, Shoshone Falls in Idaho, all of the redwoods especially on the OR-CA border, Route 1 - the PCH - was STUNNING and had just reopened after landslides so was not busy, i think many thought it still closed. Did a side trip to the Salton Sea/Bombay Beach and Slab City/Salvation Mountain then accidentally through North Algodones Dunes Wilderness Area which was unreal, like I imagine the Sahara to be. Got pulled over for an imigration checkpointaround there. That day was a big surprise of lots of cool stuff.  I lunched and thrift shopped in Moab (didn't do the national parks there - no annual pass and was too rushed), dipped in numerous rivers, lakes, hot springs even a pool/wave pool in some little town. The Palo Duro canyon in TX is second only to Grand Canyon in size but you can drive  in and down for like $5.\n\nI would have liked more time, but it was a great trip.  My mom had died just a couple of months before this, and she had done a similar solo trip a few years before, so I was kind of doing it for/with/inspired by her.\n\nI'd love to do it again sometime, with a different route. I'm from the east coast so that's boring to me, this was mostly new places I'd never seen.\n\nI kept a budget somewhere I'll dig up if I can find it.",

            "comment": "I just left Orlando and did something similar over the last 2 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I left Florida in April, I didn't stop until I got to New Mexico but I wish I would've gone to Big Bend. Went through El Paso and saw White Sands National Park and then the Very Large Array in the same day. Spent the night on the New Mexico/Arizona border and saw Petrified Forest National Park and the meteor crater the next day. I then spent a month in Flagstaff, visiting Grand Canyon, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Captial Reef, Canyonlands(Needles only), Mesa Verde, and Arches in that month. \n\nOf these, Zion and Bryce Canyon were my favorite, Grand Canyon was underwhelming and Mesa Verde is not worth it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would also recommend Antelope Canyon, this is near the Grand Canyon and is on your way to Zion, it requires a paid tour but is 100% worth it. Horseshoe Bend is right next to it. I would do this over Grand Escelante National Monument. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm now spending a month in Denver and exploring the Colorado area. So far my favorite have been Hanging Lake, the Maroon Bells(This is a lifetime must tbh), and Rocky Mountain NP. If you can swing it, I'd visit these instead of Great Sand Dunes personally since you're already going to White Sands. These three are along the way of Arches and Canyonlands so they wouldn't take you far off route if you were to visit these parks as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd also skip Mobile, De Soto, Houston, and Panama City for more time in the Colorado Rockies personally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you haven't already, get an America the Beautiful pass. It's $80 and you get into every National Park/National Monument/Federal Land for free for a year. Also a lot of the parks required a timed entry now. They sell out quick but are also released the day before. I've never had a problem so long as I'm online and buying them the moment they come out. \n\nOf the list above, these require reservations while I visited, make sure to double check every location: Angels Landing at Zion(lottery for timed entry), Arches(timed entry), Hanging Lake(timed entry), Maroon Bells(need to get a bus ticket), Rocky Mountain(timed entry).",

It's also important to mention that while I'm spending a month long at each location, I'm only visiting these on the weekends. I am still working full-time on the weekdays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the weekends I'm also sleeping in my car. Not sure how much you want to rough it but at least for the days to and from it might be worth saving time and money sleeping at rest stops. I've removed my back seats and put a cot in, but a air matress works as well. The only other thing you'd need is a sleeping bag, a USB fan, and the $20 roll of reflectix to block out the light",

Check out Buckskin Gulch, Horseshoe Bend and you might as well try and get permits to the Wave (Coyote Bluffs). You also didn\u2019t mention which side of the Grand Canyon you plan on visiting. That could add a significant amount of driving time.",

            "comment": "As someone who traveled from Mississippi to Alaska, it took us (two of us) 14 days to enjoy the trip, and this included 3 days of straight traveling. This may be a lot for one person to drive in 20 days but is definitely doable! \n\nGrand Canyon - you can easily spend a full day there. There are tours you can go one to take you hiking, ATV-ing, boat tours, and air tours. This also depends on what part you are going to, there's a few entrances. \n\nAs someone from Mississippi, I recommend stopping to get some amazing food in any of the Southern states. There's a lot of small diners and bigger places to get some excellent food. Although you may already have experience with good southern cooking in Florida, depending on where you travel to. \n\nZions National Park - make sure you have reservations! I don't know how relaxed they are about it now but I almost didn't go in because I forgot about reservations. Zion is extremely crowed, I was surprised by this and a little disappointed. I am glad I went but everyone hyped up the trails more than it was needed. You of course have to do Angel's Landing, GET RESERVATIONS FOR THIS!!!! One more thing, if you just type in \"Zion National Park\" you may end up at the wrong entrance and have to backtrack to get to the actual entrance. \n\nIt has been a while so I don't remember everywhere we stopped but make sure you get plenty of sleep. When you are in areas with deserts, it gets harder to stay awake behind the wheel as there isn't much to see and there are sometimes sudden turns in the canyons. Please pull over and take naps if you need to, don't try to force yourself, it's dangerous! \n\nAlso give yourself time to just enjoy where you are, you may want to stay at some places more than you thought and you will eat up your time. It's YOUR trip so it's for you to decide! Happy travels :)",

It's similar to driving in Mississippi dirt/gravel roads but with moose and caribou. However the last time I went, it was snowing pretty intensely close to Skagway, AK. Snow so high that you couldn't see anything around you, just follow the road.\n\nBut there's a couple different routes but I have mostly taken the one along the coast of Canada so it's a straight shot and you don't need directions for the most part. \n\nI am a road tripper so I can go pretty far without stopping. I highly recommend downloading podcasts, audiobooks, music, and just watch the scenery.",
